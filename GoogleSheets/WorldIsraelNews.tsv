Biden administration questions firing of Israeli defense minister...	American officials say the Biden administration is 'concerned' by Prime Minister Netanyahu's decision to replace his defense minister, speculating that the premier used the election as an opportunity to remove a figure considered more moderate by the White House. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration was taken aback by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision Tuesday to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud), leaving top White House officials 'concerned.' Publicly, the U.S. has vowed to work 'closely' with Gallant's replacement. 'America’s commitment to Israel’s security remains ironclad and the US Department of Defense will continue to work closely with Israel’s next Minister of Defense,' said Defense Department spokesman Major General Patrick Ryder. Privately, however, administration officials were vexed by the sudden announcement. Multiple American officials spoke with The Times of Israel, telling the media outlet that the U.S. had no foreknowledge of Netanyahu's plans to replace his defense chief, and that the decision, made in the midst of a major conflict on two fronts and amid concerns of a major Iranian attack, was unnerving for the White House. Some officials speculated that Netanyahu took advantage of the American election to fire Gallant, who has been perceived by the Biden administration as a moderate voice within the Israeli government and a useful ally. 'We have real questions about the reasons for Gallant’s firing and about what is driving the decision,' one American official was quoted as saying. 'The surprising decision to fire Defense Minister Gallant is concerning, especially in the middle of two wars and as Israel prepares to defend against a potential attack from Iran.' On Tuesday, Netanyahu announced that he had removed Gallant from his position, saying that during the wars against Hamas and Hezbollah, his trust in his defense chief had 'begun to crack.' 'Gallant and I had substantial disagreements on the management of the military campaign, disagreements which were accompanied by public statements and actions that contravened the decisions of the Government and the Security Cabinet,' Netanyahu said. 'I have made multiple attempts to resolve these disagreements, but they became increasingly wider. They were also brought to the knowledge of the public in an inappropriate manner, and what is even worse, they have reached the knowledge of the enemy; our enemies have taken great delight in these disagreements and have derived much benefit from them.' Netanyahu tapped long-time ally Israel Katz (Likud), who currently serves as Foreign Minister, to replace Gallant, while Minister Without Portfolio Gideon Sa'ar, a former member of the Likud and rival of Netanyahu, is slated to take over as Foreign Minister.

Josh Stein defeats former self-described ‘black Nazi’ to become f...	The Democratic attorney general handily beat the lieutenant governor who once called himself a 'black Nazi.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News North Carolina Attorney-General Josh Stein became the state’s first Jewish governor Tuesday by beating Republican Mark Robinson, who once described himself as a 'black Nazi.' The race was called after Stein won 54.8% of the vote to Robinson’s 40.2%. His victory was largely expected by October, mostly due to the notoriety Lieut. Gov. Robinson gained for both sexist and antisemitic comments he had made which came to light during the campaign. CNN revealed in September that between 2008-2012, Robinson had posted on a pornography website that he was a 'black NAZI,' backed the idea of bringing back slavery, and wrote sexually graphic stories, including one about being a 'Peeping Tom' in a local gym’s women’s showers. After this story broke, Donald Trump distanced himself from Robinson even though he had been an early favorite of the former – and next – U.S. president. Robinson, who only broke into politics in 2020, had also posted antisemitic statements such as calling the Black Panther superhero movie a creation of 'an agnostic Jew' made solely 'to pull the shekels out of your Schvartze pockets,' using the derogatory Yiddish term for black people. In 2017 he called the Holocaust 'hogwash' and seemingly disputed the fact that six million Jews had been murdered during World War II. While calling some of his past comments 'poorly worded,' however, Robinson denied being an antisemite and has been a vocal supporter of Israel in its ongoing war against Hamas. Stein, meanwhile, broke the religion barrier to the highest office in the state as a Reform Jew known for being active in his synagogue. He has publicly embraced his Judaism, posting to X before Rosh Hashanah in 2022 that 'Our Jewish faith obliges us to do our part to make the world a better place, better than we found it. This principle guides me as your attorney general.' Regarding Israel, Stein follows the line set by President Joe Biden. Just a few days after the Hamas invasion and massacre of 1,200 people on October 7, 2023, he attended a Jewish event and also wrote in solidarity, 'We stand with Israel.' But following months of pro-Palestinian protests and encampments on college campuses that included some in his own state, he took a more nuanced stance after a large anti-Israel protest took place at the University of North Carolina in May. 'The right to free speech is fundamental, and students should be able to exercise it peacefully. But any antisemitism, violence or other acts of hate are unacceptable. The safety of all students is critical,' he told a news reporter. Like Biden as well, he is a believer in the so-called 'two state solution' to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and has echoed the administration’s more recent commentary on the ongoing war. 'Hamas represents a real threat to Israel,' he told The News & Observer several months ago. 'Israel is justified to try to address that threat. They have to do it in a way that minimizes … the impact on civilians because there are a couple of million Palestinians who live in Gaza who have nothing to do with Hamas, and are just trying to live their lives.' Stein is succeeding another Democrat, Roy Cooper, who couldn’t run again due to term limits, even though North Carolina is a solidly red state on a national level, having voted for a Democratic president only once in the last 44 years.

Harris won 79% of the Jewish vote, exit polling shows	President-elect Donald Trump appears to have underperformed among Jewish voters according to initial exit polls, but made massive gains among other minority groups. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Vice President Kamala Harris won the overwhelming majority of votes cast by American Jews in battleground states in Tuesday's election, and potentially outperforming every Democratic candidate in the past two decades, initial exit polls indicate. Harris is projected to lose the election not only in the electoral college, but potentially also in the popular vote, where she currently trails by over five million votes. According to preliminary exit poll data collected by the Edison Research firm on behalf of multiple media outlets, including the Washington Post and NBC News, 79% of American Jews voted for the vice president, compared to just 21% who voted for former President Donald Trump. If correct, the initial estimate would place Harris ahead of every Democratic presidential candidate since then-Vice President Al Gore ran against George W. Bush in 2000, winning 79% of the Jewish vote to Bush's 19%. According to the Jewish Virtual Library, no candidate has received more than 79% since Bill Clinton in 1992. At the same time, Harris underperformed, among other minority groups, including blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, and American Indians. While the vast majority of African Americans voted for Harris, the Democratic share of the black vote fell from 87% in 2020 exit polls to 86%. The drop was far more pronounced among Hispanic/Latino voters, with Trump receiving 45% of the Hispanic/Latino vote, compared to 32% in 2020, while Harris received 53%, down from 65% for Joe Biden four years earlier. American Indians backed Trump by a nearly two-to-one margin, 64% to 35%, while those in the 'Other' category were more evenly divided, 50% backing Trump compared to 45% who backed Harris, according to the exit polls. White Evangelical Christians backed Trump over Harris by a margin of 81% to 17%. One caveat in the data is that the preliminary exiting polling is based on the results in ten key battleground states. While the difference between national results and the combined results from those ten battleground states may be minor for some demographic groups, it leaves out the bulk of the Orthodox Jewish population, centered around New York and New Jersey, potentially skewing the results in favor of Harris and against Trump. Other exit polling data, collected by AP VoteCast for The Associated Press, showed Harris winning just 67% of the Jewish vote, more in keeping with recent elections, compared to Trump with 31%. Among Muslim voters, 61% voted for Harris, down from 63% who backed Joe Biden in 2020, with Trump winning 30%, down from 35% in 2020.

‘History’s greatest comeback’ – Netanyahu congratulates Trump	Prime Minister Netanyahu one of the first world leaders to congratulate Donald Trump on his 2024 presidential election victory. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin and his wife Sara are among the first world leaders to congratulate president-elect Donald Trump on winning the 2024 U.S. presidential election. 'Dear Donald and Melania Trump, Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback!' read a statement from the premier's office. 'Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory! In true friendship, yours, Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu.' Netanyahu's Miami-based son, Yair, also offered his congratulations to Trump. 'Hallelujah! The most pro-Israel president in America's history is back! Great day for America! Great day for Israel! Great day for the free world!' the younger Netanyahu wrote on his Instagram account. 'Congratulations to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump,' wrote Culture Minister Miki Zohar, of Netanyahu's Likud party, on social media platform X. 'We are already looking forward to the next four years.' 'God bless America. God bless Israel,' wrote Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionism) on his X account. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Religious Zionism) reposted a tweet he wrote earlier this year, which read 'God bless Trump.' He then added one word: 'Yesssss.' Notably, Trump is reportedly putting pressure on Israel to wrap up its war in Gaza before he takes office in January 2025. It's unclear if Trump would demand that Israel withdraw all of its troops from the Strip, or if a declaration officially ending the war would suffice. In his victory speech at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the president-elect appeared to reference the ongoing fighting in the Middle East. 'I’m not going to start wars, I’m going to stop wars,' Trump said in his victory speech. When he was president, Trump added, 'we had no wars, for four years we had no wars. Except we defeated ISIS.'

‘Wake up, Iran wants to destroy us’ – Arab Israeli activist	Israel can't be complacent when Iran is threatening a nuclear strike on Tel Aviv, says prominent Zionist Arab activist Yosef Haddad. By World Israel News Staff A large banner hung in Tehran depicting a nuclear attack on Tel Aviv sparked an impassioned response from a prominent pro-Israel Arab activist, who urged Israel to wake up to the existential threat posed by the Islamic state. 'The Iranian regime hung this sign in the heart of Tehran. In Farsi, it reads 'Teloshima' - a play on words of Tel Aviv and Hiroshima. Along with the image [of a nuclear explosion], everyone can understand the threat - a nuclear missile striking Tel Aviv,' wrote Yosef Haddad on his Instagram account. Haddad, an Arab-Christian citizen of Israel who publicly advocates on behalf of the Jewish State, stressed that Iran's nuclear development program poses a real threat to Israel's existence. 'In this case you don't need good intelligence, you don't need Unit 8200 or the Mossad,' he continued. 'The writing on the wall, or in this case on a billboard in the heart of Iran, is clear. They are threatening in a direct, personal way&#8230;[making it clear that] their goal is to destroy us, and we must not be apathetic or complacent for a moment,' Haddad added. 'You cannot rely on the world or anyone else to do the work for our security, only us, only the IDF. This sign, together with their recent threats to attack us again, give us a good reason to strike their nuclear sites&#8230;It's time to chop off the snake's head.' Iran launched two unprecedented ballistic missile attacks against Israel in a six month span, causing damage to military sites throughout the country. Under intense pressure from the Biden administration, Israel launched a retaliatory strike against Iran, but avoided attacking the Islamic Republic's nuclear sites or oil assets. Iran is threatening to once again strike Israel with previously unused weaponry, triggering warnings from Israel that should Iran attack a third time, Israel will 'not hold back' with its response.

Trump defeats Harris, Republicans retake US Senate	President-elect Donald Trump wins key battleground states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, securing the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President Donald Trump has won Tuesday's presidential election, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris, according to projections by Fox News and RealClearPolitics early Wednesday morning. Trump is now projected to win Pennsylvania, with both Fox News and RCP calling the crucial battleground state with its 19 electoral votes, putting him over the top to 270, assuming he wins Alaska, which is widely expected to go Republican by a wide margin. Fox News has also called Wisconsin, with ten electoral votes, for Trump putting him at 277 electoral votes called already, and 280 electoral votes with Alaska's expected support for the Republican candidate. As of 2:00 a.m. Eastern Time, Trump currently leads Harris in the popular vote count with 67.7 million votes, compared to 62.6 million for the Vice President. The former president also won the key battleground states of Georgia and North Carolina with leads of over two points in each state, 50.7% to 48.5%, and 51.0% to 47.8% respectively. With 94.8% of the vote counted in Pennsylvania, Trump currently leads Harris by nearly three points, 50.98% to 48.06%, with an even larger lead in Wisconsin with 89% of the vote counted, with Trump up with 51.3% to 47.2% for Harris. In his home state of New York, Trump made major inroads and is now on track to win the largest share of the vote for a Republican presidential nominee since George H.W. Bush in 1988. With 96% of the vote counted, Trump has received 44.57% of the vote, up from 37.6% in 2020 and 36.5% in 2016. The prediction market platform Polymarket currently shows Trump with a 98.9% chance of winning the election, with the former president likely to win Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona. Trump leads Harris in all three states by margins ranging from 1.5 points to 6.3 points. Should the former president win all three states and lose Nebraska's Second Congressional district, as he is expected to, he will win 312 of the 538 electoral votes, win Harris receiving 226. In addition to Trump's presidential win, Republicans are projected to retake control of the U.S. Senate, flipping control over of seats in West Virginia and Ohio, giving the GOP at least 51 seats, with Democrats projected to win at least 15 seats for a total of 43, with 6 races yet to be called.

Bernie Marcus, Home Depot founder who gave to Republicans and Isr...	Marcus helped propel Trump into the White House in 2016 by contributing $7 million and gave even more four years later to finance his failed reelection campaign. By Asaf Elia-Shalev, JTA Bernie Marcus, the billionaire who co-founded Home Depot and became a Republican megadonor and supporter of civic and political causes in the United States and Israel, has died. Marcus, 95, died late Monday in Boca Raton, Florida. His death came on the eve of an election into which he had poured millions of dollars to support Donald Trump and Republicans across the country. In the final political donation recorded publicly before his death, made in July, Marcus gave $1 million to the United Democracy Project, a campaign fundraising group affiliated with the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC that Marcus has supported since its creation in 2022. 'The Home Depot is deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved founder, Bernard Marcus,' the company he founded in 1978 said in a statement announcing Marcus’ death. 'To us, he was simply ‘Bernie.’' Over the course of his life, Marcus donated more than $2 billion to various causes, according to Forbes, and he leaves behind an estimated net worth of $11 billion that will mostly go to the Marcus Foundation. Born to Jewish immigrants in Newark, New Jersey, in 1929, Marcus 'never lost sight of his humble roots, using his success not for fame or fortune but to generously help others,' the company said. Among Marcus’ legacies are the transformation of downtown Atlanta with the establishment of the Georgia Aquarium; a massive advance in autism awareness and research thanks to the Marcus Autism Center, also in Atlanta; and the founding of the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem, an important think tank focused on governance. 'The State of Israel lost one of its greatest friends, and I have lost my wisest mentor,' IDI President Yohanan Plesner said in a statement. Toward the end of his life, Marcus, with his wife Billi, became perhaps best known for his staunch support of Donald Trump, second only to Sheldon Adelson among conservative Jewish megadonors. Marcus helped propel Trump into the White House in 2016 by contributing $7 million and gave even more four years later to finance his failed reelection campaign. Last year, he said he intended to support Trump again in this year’s election despite the former president’s felony convictions and his 'brash style.' 'We must change the current trajectory of the nation and solve the problems created in the last three years,' Marcus wrote in November 2023 in an oped endorsing Trump. 'We must also reject calls from some politicians to replace our free market system with big government socialism.' Marcus also defended former Trump advisor Steve Bannon against charges of abetting antisemitism and extremism. At one point, Home Depot fended off calls to boycott the company over Marcus’ politics. Unlike Adelson, his peer in philanthropy and Republican politics, Marcus donated money in Israel while making sure to avoid taking sides in the country’s fractured parliamentary politics. In addition to the nonpartisan Israel Democracy Institute, he gave to causes like health care, including the Marcus National Blood Services Center, established with a $25 million donation. His philanthropy in Israel was rooted in his sense of identity. 'I’m proud of the fact that I’m Jewish and what happened with the Holocaust is not going to happen again if I can do anything about it,' he said in an extensive profile published by Philanthropy Magazine in 2012. Where some focused on threats from without, Marcus worried primarily about how the country’s own government structures were undermining its viability. 'Until Israel has a constitution and a Bill of Rights, the rule of law is murky. And I’m a great believer in the rule of law,' he said in 2012. Israel still has no constitution. Born months before the start of the Great Depression, Marcus was raised in a tenement in Newark, New Jersey by immigrant parents from Russia. A teenager during World War II and its aftermath, he joined his family on trips to the Catskills where he performed magic and hypnotism. The experience of reading and satisfying an audience helped seed a dream of becoming a psychiatrist. But Marcus’ parents couldn’t afford to send him to medical school so he became a pharmacist instead. (He also said he was rejected because of quotas limiting Jewish enrollment.) He didn’t much care for the technical side of the field, but he took a liking to sales. That realization led him to become a retail manager, taking ever larger roles until he came to a chain of hardware stores in Los Angeles. At age 49, after leaving the company amid corporate turmoil, Marcus joined Arthur Blank to found a new home improvement retailer with a vision that would transform the industry. The pair picked Atlanta as their starting point, found investors and quickly opened a number of stores under the Home Depot banner. They tapped into a massive unmet demand among Americans to fix up their own homes. Unlike the old-style of hardware stores, Home Depot offered a massive warehouse space that stocked not only tools but paint and lumber, which had typically required a visit to separate retailers. In Marcus’ 19 years as CEO, Home Depot became a ubiquitous American brand. He remained chair of the company’s board of directors until 2002 when he left to focus on giving away the wealth he had accumulated. In 2010, Marcus signed the Giving Pledge, the initiative by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet to encourage the ultra-wealthy to give away a majority of their money to charity. Then, in 2020, he joined the Jewish Future Pledge, a promise by its signers to earmark most of their wealth to Jewish or Israel-related causes. He had been raised to give away his money, Marcus said in an interview, pointing to the memory of his mother who sometimes denied him a nickel for ice cream, saying the coin was going toward planting trees in Israel instead. Marcus took pride in his company’s record of ingraining the value of tzedakah, or charity, in his employees. 'Kids come out of working at Home Depot and they all have this feeling of tzedakah. I turned them all into Jews!' he was once quoted as saying. The largest and most notable acts of charity were not necessarily dedicated to Jewish causes. In Georgia, he was a major patron of civic institutions. In the late 1990s, Marcus and the then-governor of Georgia, Roy Barnes, flew back to Atlanta from a tour of Israel. During the flight, Marcus said he wanted to give a gift to the city of Atlanta, proposing an aquarium that could anchor a redevelopment of downtown. That conversation culminated in one of the largest facilities of its kind in the world, the Georgia Aquarium, which opened in 2005 thanks in large part to a $250 million donation from Marcus. An employee’s struggles parenting a child with autism spurred Marcus’ interest in the issue, which he championed by founding a world-leading institute, the Marcus Autism Center, and spearheading a research and advocacy group, Autism Speaks. Also in the realm of heath, he was a major donor to Atlanta’s Shepherd Center for spinal and brain injury rehabilitation, and the founding donor of a neuroscience institute at the Boca Raton Regional Hospital in Florida. Marcus was also influential in the field of philanthropy itself, modeling a business-like mindset that always sought as large a return on a philanthropic investment as possible. His libertarian ideology and faith in the free market also drove his contributions to advocacy against government regulations. In his final years, Marcus grew increasingly concerned about antisemitism in the United States and on college campuses, which he said he thought had risen to the levels he experienced as a child and young adult prior to the founding of Israel. In a January 2023 video interview with the Jewish News Syndicate, he said Jews who donated to universities, which he said taught students to hate Judaism and Israel, were 'not the brightest people in the world.' In contrast, he said, he was careful to give in ways that advanced his values. 'We are very careful with our giving. And we’ve given away over $2 billion in the last several years, and in the places that we’ve given it, we follow it very carefully,' he said. 'We check it. We make sure that the money is being spent the way it should be spent.' Marcus is survived by his wife and stepson; his children from his first marriage; and grandchildren, for whom he said his 2022 book, 'Kick Up Some Dust: Lessons on Thinking Big, Giving Back, and Doing It Yourself,' was intended. 'I haven’t been the greatest grandfather in the world because I’ve been busy doing so many things,' he said in the JNS interview. 'I wanted them to know all the things I’m doing.'

Bomb threats targeting polling places came from Russian email dom...	Georgia, a crucial swing state, received more than 24 threats, most of which occurred in Atlanta’s Fulton County, Georgia’s most populated district. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon More than two dozen non-credible bomb threats targeting polling places across the country came from 'Russian email domains,' the FBI said Tuesday. 'The FBI is aware of bomb threats to polling locations in several states, many of which appear to originate from Russian email domains. None of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far,' the agency said in a statement. The FBI did not say which states received the threats. One official told Reuters that Georgia, a crucial swing state, received more than 24 threats, most of which occurred in Atlanta’s Fulton County, Georgia’s most populated district. At least two Fulton County polling locations targeted by the threats were briefly evacuated on Tuesday. Those two locations reopened after half an hour, officials said. The county is urging a judge to extend the voting sites’ hours past the 7 p.m. deadline. Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger condemned Russia’s interference in his state’s elections. 'They're up to mischief, it seems. They don't want us to have a smooth, fair, and accurate election, and if they can get us to fight among ourselves, they can count that as a victory,' he said. Raffensperger also applauded Georgia’s response to the initial threats saying, 'We pretty well dispelled that very quickly.'

New poll shows majority of Dems blame Israel for Mideast conflict	American voters show strong support (55%) for economic sanctions against Iran, particularly targeting its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. By Jewish Breaking News A new poll has exposed a dramatic partisan divide over the Middle East conflict, with an overwhelming 60% of Democratic voters holding Israel responsible for the escalation – a view shared by only one-quarter of Republicans. The survey conducted by AP-NORC, shows broad agreement across party lines that Hamas, Iran’s government, and Hezbollah bear significant responsibility, with approximately 60% of all voters attributing 'a lot' of blame to these actors. However, the Democratic base’s hostile attitude towards Israel could impact Vice President Harris’s grab at Michigan and Pennsylvania which have a significant Jewish and Muslim presence. In Michigan, Vice President Kamala Harris holds onto a precarious 4-point lead over Donald Trump (49%-45%) and in Pennsylvania she holds a one-point advantage with 48%-47%. On policy responses, American voters show strong support (55%) for economic sanctions against Iran, particularly targeting its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Yet they remain deeply divided on military aid, with more voters opposing than supporting direct funding for Israeli military operations. The prospect of American military involvement generates significant concern, with about 40% of voters expressing serious worries about potential U.S. engagement. Support for troop deployment remains minimal – only about two in ten voters favor sending U.S. forces to assist Israel, with a similar number remaining neutral on the issue. Regarding diplomatic efforts, approximately half of voters believe the U.S. is doing 'about as much as it can' to broker agreements between Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah. However, opinion splinters with roughly 30% pushing for increased involvement and 20% advocating for less engagement.'

Jewish Democrats elected governor in Delaware, North Carolina, Cr...	A former public-school math teacher and small-business owner, Meyer is a staunch supporter of Israel, which he has visited three times. By Menachem Wecker and Izzy Salant, JNS With the election of Matt Meyer and Josh Stein as governor of Delaware and North Carolina, respectively, on Tuesday, the two join four other Jewish governors: Jared Polis (Colo.), J. B. Pritzker (Ill.), Josh Green (Hawaii) and Josh Shapiro (Pa.), all Democrats. 'It’s great to be at a point where a Jewish governor, even in states with small Jewish populations, is not unusual,' according to Mark Mellman, CEO of an eponymous polling and consulting firm and president of Democratic Majority for Israel. 'The Democratic Party is committed to equal opportunity and pluralism a fact reinforced by the fact that all six of these Jewish governors are Democrats,' Mellman told JNS. The Associated Press called the Delaware gubernatorial race for Meyer, who defeated Mike Ramone, a member of the Delaware state House. With 90% of votes counted, Meyer was up 11.8 percentage points, with 274,823 votes, per the AP. A former public-school math teacher and small-business owner, Meyer is a staunch supporter of Israel, which he has visited three times. He told Jewish Insider 'Israel is going through a really challenging time right now, and we have to do what we can to support what is one of America’s strongest allies in the world.' Stein, North Carolina’s attorney general, was up nearly 15 percentage points on Republican Mark Robinson, with 2.6 million votes and 83% of votes counted, per the AP, which called the race. Robinson, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina, came under fire for social-media posts, including calling himself 'a black Nazi' and quoting Hitler. Robinson denied having posted the comments. U.S. President Joe Biden called Meyer and Stein, among others, to congratulate them on their election, per the White House pool report. Craig Goldman, a Republican member of the Texas state House, defeated Trey Hunt to become the representative of Texas’s 12th Congressional District. Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas) currently holds the seat but opted not to seek reelection. Goldman is the third Jewish GOP member of the U.S. House of Representatives after incumbents Reps. Max Miller (R-Ohio) and David Kustoff (R-Tenn.). Kustoff defeated Sarah Freeman in the state’s 8th Congressional District, according to the Associated Press. With 79% of votes counted, Kustoff was up 47.5 percentage points, with 235,357 votes, per the AP. With 88% of votes counted in Ohio’s 7th Congressional District, Miller was up more than 15 percentage points with 179,269 votes, per the AP, which called the race. Goldman was up nearly 30 percentage points, with 192,808 votes and 78% of votes counted, according to the Associated Press, which called the race. 'Welcome to Congress one of my best friends,' wrote Matt Brooks, CEO of the Republican Jewish Coalition. 'So proud of you, brother.' AIPAC, which endorsed Goldman, wrote shortly before 11 p.m. that 'so far, 190 AIPAC-backed candidates have won their elections tonight.' Goldman drew praise from House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.)—who chairs the House Republican Conference—and Aryeh Lightstone, a former senior adviser to David Friedman, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel. On his campaign website, Goldman stated that he would stand with Israel, 'the only true democracy in the Middle East.' 'The enemies of Israel are dangerous and relentless. The October 2023 slaughter of over 1,400 Israelis, including at least 36 Americans, at the hands of Hamas makes this reality abundantly clear,' he wrote. 'While Israeli hostages remain captive in Gaza, it is critical that Israel is able to defend herself and ultimately is able to achieve its military objective: to dismantle Hamas.' 'There is simply no room for ambivalence or wavering on where the United States stands in this matter,' he added on the site. 'The United States must continue to stand by Israel in its fight against the sheer brutality and inhumanity of Hamas.'

Hostage families organization says Gallant firing provides ‘new o...	We trust Minister Katz to increase and further intensify the military pressure on what is left of Hamas in Gaza. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Tikva Forum, a hostage family organization that rejects negotiations with terrorists, finds new hope for the release of family members following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's firing of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The dismissal of Minister Galant and the appointment of Israel Katz opens up an opportunity for us to make a strategic change regarding the return of the hostages,' the Tikva Forum stated. The Tikva Forum said it would support proposals to offer money in exchange for the hostages and to continue to defeat Hamas to put pressure on the terror group to release captives. 'We trust Minister Katz to increase and further intensify the military pressure on what is left of Hamas in Gaza. All means are kosher for the return of our children,' the organization said. The Hostages Families Forum also called Gallant's dismissal a 'continuation' of efforts within the government to 'torpedo a hostage deal.' Netanyahu announced the firing of Gallant in a video statement, saying, 'Unfortunately, the trust between me and the minister of defense has been broken over the past months. There were significant gaps regarding the management of the [military] campaign, and these gaps were accompanied by statements and actions that contradicted the government's decisions.' 'I made repeated efforts to bridge these gaps, but they only widened. These issues even reached the public in an unacceptable manner, and, worse, became known to our enemies, who took pleasure and found advantage in it,' added Netanyahu. Israel is offering Gaza terrorists who are holding hostages captive large cash rewards and the promise of free passage out of the Gaza Strip for themselves and their families if they hand over the hostages to Israel, Israel's Channel 12 reported Monday night. According to the report, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed security officials to offer a massive reward, totaling 'several million dollars,' some outlets reporting $5 million, for each captive who is freed, along with guarantees of safe passage out of the Gaza Strip for any captors who agree to the deal.

Netanyahu may also fire heads of IDF and Shin Bet	The incoming Defense Minister, Israel Katz, is expected to carry out Netanyahu's plans. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News After Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Walla reports that he may also fire IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and the head of Shin Bet (Israel's security agency) Ronen Bar. Although Netanyahu has the sole authority to replace the head of Shin Bet, only the Defense Minister can dismiss or appoint a new IDF Chief of Staff. The incoming Defense Minister, Israel Katz, is expected to carry out Netanyahu's plans. With Katz assuming a new role as the Defense Minister, Minister-without-Portfolio Gideon Sa'ar will replace Katz as Foreign Minister. Unfortunately, the trust between me and the minister of defense has been broken over the past months. There were significant gaps regarding the management of the [military] campaign, and these gaps were accompanied by statements and actions that contradicted the decisions of the government,' the premier said in a video statement. 'I made repeated efforts to bridge these gaps, but they only widened. These issues even reached the public in an unacceptable manner, and, worse, became known to our enemies, who took pleasure and found advantage in it,' added Netanyahu. Responding to his firing on X, the defense minister wrote, 'The security of the State of Israel was and will always remain my life's mission.' Yoav Gallant and Netanyahu have been at odds since the 2023 judicial reform crisis when the Defense Minister held a press conference and urged the Prime Minister to halt the legislation amid massive protests. One day later, Netanyahu declared his intention to fire Gallant over his remarks, but this decision was reversed. Members of the security cabinet also criticized Gallant over his insistence on Palestinian rule over Gaza following the war. He also demanded that Netanyahu compromise over having security control over the Philadelphi Corridor.

Israel’s future a key focus as Harris and Trump square off in his...	With a track record of unprecedented support, Donald Trump positions himself as Israel’s defender. By Jewish Breaking News Voters head to the polls today to choose between Vice President Kamala Harris, who emerged as the Democratic nominee just three and a half months ago, and former President Donald Trump, who has spent nearly two years campaigning to reclaim the White House. The path to this historic matchup has been marked by dramatic turns. Trump launched his campaign days after the 2022 midterms, systematically defeating a field of over a dozen Republican challengers. His campaign gained momentum despite four criminal indictments, making him the first former president to face felony charges. A near-fatal assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania just before the Republican National Convention in July further galvanized his base. The race transformed dramatically when President Biden, following a disastrous late June debate performance against Trump, ended his re-election bid and endorsed Harris. The vice president’s ascension to the nomination sparked an immediate surge in Democratic fundraising and polling numbers. For Jewish voters, both candidates have emphasized unwavering support for Israel while offering starkly different visions for achieving peace and security in the Middle East. With a track record of unprecedented support, Donald Trump positions himself as Israel’s defender. 'If we continue down our current path, with four more years of Kamala, Israel will be faced not just with an attack, but with total annihilation,' Trump told the Israeli-American Council in September. 'You don’t have a protector. You have a big protector in me.' Trump also has rejected ceasefire calls in Gaza entirely, framing them as dangerous concessions. At an August press conference, he criticized Harris’s position: 'From the start, Harris has worked to tie Israel’s hands behind its back, demanding an immediate ceasefire.' Instead, Trump advocates for swift military victory, telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'Get your victory and get it over with.' Harris, on the other hand, has taken a more aggressive stance toward Israel. 'I am working to ensure it ends, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom and self-determination,' she said in a call with Jewish leaders during the High Holiday season. With approximately 75 million early votes already cast, both campaigns have concentrated their final efforts on seven crucial battleground states – Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada. \Over $2.3 billion has been spent on advertising in these decisive states, reports Fox News. On Election Eve, both nominees targeted Pennsylvania, the largest prize among swing states with 19 electoral votes. Harris concluded her campaign with a symbolic rally at Philadelphia’s 'Rocky Steps,' while Trump held a massive gathering in Pittsburgh. The former president then made his final appearance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, mirroring his closing rallies from 2016 and 2020. Harris cast her vote early by mail from California, while Trump plans to vote in person in Palm Beach, Florida. The vice president will await results at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington D.C., while Trump has chosen a convention center in West Palm Beach for his election night headquarters.

US soldier injured during Biden’s failed Gaza pier operation has ...	The Pentagon dismantled the $230 million Gaza pier in July after just three weeks of operation. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon A U.S. Army soldier died last week after suffering non-combat injuries earlier this year while supporting President Joe Biden’s humanitarian pier off the coast of Gaza, the military announced Monday. Sergeant Quandarius Davon Stanley, 23, sustained critical injuries in May while working on the U.S.-built pier, which Biden said would support the flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. Stanley recently retired from the military due to the injuries and was undergoing treatment at a long-term care facility before his death on Oct. 31. 'Stanley was an instrumental and well respected first line leader in the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary (TBX), especially during the mission to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza,' Colonel John Gray said. Two other service members sustained minor injuries during the pier’s operation and have since returned to duty, the Times of Israel reported. The Pentagon dismantled the $230 million Gaza pier in July after just three weeks of operation. The corridor helped the U.S. military deliver 137 trucks of aid into the war-torn region, but several of the trucks were intercepted before they could reach the civilian population. Aid groups criticized the project as ineffective and wasteful. Its 20-day operation was plagued by rough weather and security problems that drastically limited the amount of aid entering Gaza. Biden, who first announced the pier’s construction during his State of the Union speech in March, expressed his disappointment over the project’s failure at a news conference in July. 'I’ve been disappointed that some of the things that I put forward have not succeeded as well—like the port we attached from Cyprus,' Biden said. 'I was hopeful that would be more successful.'

Eilat’s coral reefs in distress as sea temperatures soar, scienti...	The researchers found that during the summer, water temperatures in the Gulf of Eilat reached a record high of 31.9°C, with daily peaks consistently over 30°C for two months. By Pesach Benson, TPS The vibrant coral reefs in the Gulf of Eilat are showing signs of distress stemming from an unprecedented increase in seawater temperatures, Israeli scientists warned on Tuesday. For the first time, a significant bleaching event has been documented in this area, indicating the corals’ response to an unprecedented increase in seawater temperatures. Coral bleaching is a stress response that corals undergo when exposed to environmental changes, especially increases in water temperature. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with tiny algae called zooxanthellae that live inside their tissues. These algae give corals their beautiful colors and, more importantly, provide up to 90% of the energy corals need through photosynthesis. However, when the water becomes too warm, corals become stressed and expel these algae. Without the algae, the coral tissue becomes transparent, exposing the white skeleton underneath, which is why the process is called 'bleaching.' The bleached corals look pale or completely white. Prolonged heat stress can eventually lead to coral death. A study was conducted by Dr. Assaf Zebuloni, an ecologist specializing in the Gulf of Eilat at Israel’s Nature and Parks Authority, and researchers Dr. Yonatan Shaked and Prof. Maoz Fein from the Inter-University Institute of Marine Sciences in Eilat noted that the extreme temperatures observed this year disrupted the delicate balance that allows coral to thrive. The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed Ecology and Environment journal. The researchers found that during the summer, water temperatures in the Gulf of Eilat reached a record high of 31.9°C, with daily peaks consistently over 30°C for two months. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite data, the cumulative heat stress in the Bay of Eilat was 3.75 times the threshold that typically triggers severe bleaching events in other parts of the world. In the Gulf of Eilat, corals have developed a unique resilience, adapting to the warm waters of the southern Red Sea. But only heat-resistant corals have managed to migrate north to the Gulf of Eilat, where the borders of Israel, Egypt and Jordan converge. However, this summer’s temperatures may have surpassed the threshold for the corals. 'Even with the remarkable resilience of Eilat’s corals, it appears they, too, have a limit,' said Zebuloni. 'It’s likely that the reef system has reached a critical point this year.' Local factors further exacerbate the challenge. Excess nitrates in the northern Gulf of Eilat, discharged from Israeli desalination plants and aquaculture, have combined with the heat to threaten coral health. Elevated nitrate levels make corals more vulnerable to bleaching, according to Dr. Zebuloni. He warned that any increase in these pollutants could further endanger the coral reefs. 'The combination of high temperatures and nitrate pollution is critical to coral sensitivity,' he explained. 'Given the unpredictable frequency of heat waves and rising sea temperatures, the risk of severe bleaching events has intensified.' The Nature and Parks Authority is currently surveying the affected coral populations to assess the scale of the bleaching and determine recovery and mortality rates. While the damage thus far does not appear to be catastrophic, experts are cautious, noting that once a reef reaches a tipping point, recovery may be difficult or even impossible. The situation in Eilat could follow patterns seen in other parts of the world, where reefs subjected to sudden, extreme stress have struggled to rebound. 'Israel has a responsibility to safeguard this unique ecosystem,' said Dr. Zebuloni. 'Protecting these reefs is crucial for preserving their resilience and ensuring they remain an international asset for future generations.'

The looming terror threat in central Israel	They are gathering ammunition, drawing up plans and waiting for the opportune moment. The danger is massive, growing, and imminent,' says Naomi Kahn, director of Regavim’s International Division. By John Hasten, JNS Standing on the roof of her apartment building on the eastern tip of the central Israeli town of Rosh HaAyin, just meters away from the security barrier, Moriah Tzafar shares a grave concern. 'We see [Palestinian Authority] cars driving around, getting closer to us. What are they doing here? The area is a closed military firing zone [Zone 203]. We see them carrying out tours of the fence line. There are cars, people, illegal housing, and they’re getting closer. We report this every day to the authorities,' she says. 'It reminds us of the [female] IDF spotters overlooking the Gaza border. We didn’t listen to the spotters before Oct. 7, 2023, how is it possible the same concept still exists, that we are [still] relying on a fence?' Tzafar spoke during a press tour organized by the Regavim Movement this past Monday aimed at exposing security threats to Israelis living in the center of the country. The P.A. has constructed nearly 17,000 illegal structures within a kilometer of Israel’s security fence, which stretches roughly along the 1949 Armistice Line from the Gilboa area in the north down to Ein Gedi near the Dead Sea. According to Naomi Kahn, director of Regavim’s International Division, the security threat in the center of the country is pressing. 'The level of danger to Israelis living near the seamline is not a possibility, it is a reality. There have already been incursions and terrorist attacks in seamline communities and deep into Israel,' she told JNS. 'The level of danger is higher than we’d like to admit, as massive quantities of arms are coming in through Judea and Samaria [via Jordan] because the Gaza border is secured and northern border is in the process of being secured, so the Iranian proxies and anti-Israel forces are concentrating their efforts on the much longer and less protected seamline area,' she said. 'They are gathering ammunition, drawing up plans and waiting for the opportune moment. The danger is massive, growing, and imminent.' Kahn explained that during the Oslo Accords the seam line was created to prevent an Oct. 7-style scenario by forming a buffer zone and increasing Israel’s reaction time against a potential hostile invasion. However, despite the fact that it is illegal under international law to enter, build, plant, or make any physical changes within 500 meters of the security barrier, the P.A. constantly does so, she said. In 2002, during the height of the Second Intifada, the Israeli government began construction of the security fence along the seam line in an attempt to prevent terrorist incursions into the center of the country. However, according to Regavim, the state has ignored the P.A. attempts to annex Area C of Judea and Samaria, and no steps have been taken push back against the illegal encroachment on state lands, which includes the construction of 90,000 illegal structures in areas under full Israeli jurisdiction. At the same time, the security fence has be sabotaged repeatedly, to the point that many kilometers of the barrier have been completely demolished. Rani Gavriel, the head of Rosh HaAyin’s auxiliary neighborhood patrol unit, working with local police to try and keep the community safe, told JNS that, '6,000 Arabs pour into Israel illegally on a daily basis.' He described a constant battle against theft, sexual assault and terrorist attacks by Arabs who penetrate the seam line. 'The Arab’s best weapon is the olive tree,' he said. 'Even if the olives aren’t ready to be picked, they are in the fields using the trees as cover to carry out surveillance. These people are just like Hamas or Hezbollah. They openly say that Rosh HaAyin is theirs.' Gavriel said he has been warning of the threat for years, meeting with the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and Internal Security Committee back in 2021, but nobody is listening. 'Oct. 7 wasn’t an isolated incident,' he warned. 'We’re getting ready for the next one.' Accompanied by a military escort, the group was taken into the nearby Firing Zone 203, located just to the east in Samaria. Kahn explained that Israel set up many firing zones on state land following Israel’s withdrawal from Sinai under the 1979 peace agreement with Egypt. Despite the fact that these training areas are closed military zones, Kahn said the P.A. encourages Arabs to move into them in order to create the illusion that ancient Arab villages existed there. Firing Zone 203 is home to massive illegal construction, with beautiful villas and sports fields. E.M. (who asked that his name be withheld) the land protection officer for the Shomron Regional Council, who led the tour of the area, pointed out that we were traveling on a brand-new paved east/west route extending closer and closer to Rosh HaAyin. 'When we see the illegal construction we report it to the Civil Administration,' he told JNS. 'They are working, but not doing enough. It’s time to wake up, destroy the illegal construction and take a stand against the P.A., which is being funded by foreign entities.' In the firing zone, Barak Werker, CEO of the Green Now organization, focused on the environmental damage to the area caused by the P.A., which he said affects P.A. Arabs and Israelis alike. 'When it comes to environmental issues, there are no borders. The seamline doesn’t exist,' he said. Back in Rosh HaAyin, Moriah Tzafar had told the group her family suffers daily due to illegal burning of waste carried out by P.A. Arabs. 'We are forced to sleep with the windows closed every night' she explained. Werker stressed how the P.A. acts like a third world country, causing air pollution through illegal burns, especially of electronic waste, as well as water pollution by dumping raw sewage into streams. In his view, both Israel and the P.A. need to put politics aside, and one entity needs to be created to handle all environmental issues. Heading a bit further to the east in Samaria, the group was taken to the Avichai cattle farm, established on top of a hill on state land by Eitan Melet and his family more than a year ago. With clear views of Rosh HaAyin and Tel Aviv to the west, Melet told JNS, 'We are here protecting the seamline communities through a constant Jewish presence.' The Arab terrorists who carried out the 2022 terrorist attack in the city of Elad in which four Israelis were murdered, had set out from the area in which the farm is now located, he said, implying that the attack could have been prevented had there been an Israeli presence in the area at the time. 'Our purpose is to safeguard the land of Israel,' said Melet. When asked what Israel could do to increase security in the post-Oct. 7 reality, Kahn said, 'The government must treat our enemies as enemies. It must stop living under the false concept of enabling Arabs to come through and providing the Arabs with economic incentives not to attack us. We saw along the Gaza border that that is a completely false assumption, but that’s still an assumption that forms the basis of Israel’s policy. That has to be changed.' Israel, she continued, must 'take the P.A. at its word—it intends to create a Palestinian state in all of Judea and Samaria, and we have to look carefully at what the P.A. has done up till now with its security forces. A P.A. state will not be one that intends to live in peaceful coexistence. Dozens of Israelis have been murdered by the official P.A. police forces while hundreds have been wounded. Their security apparatus is aimed at us and is waiting simply for the opportune moment to unleash another Oct. 7 upon us,' she added. According to Kahn, 'Regavim is collecting the information and analyzing it and making sure our decision makers, most importantly our political leadership, understands what’s happening on the ground.' The organization also initiates lawsuits 'that force the government of Israel to take notice, respond and explain its failure to act. And through those court cases we expose the underlying misconceptions and dispel them. We propose alternatives to the failed paradigms that we see are still in operation and we try to encourage our politicians to act in our national interests by first and foremost treating our enemies like enemies,' she said.

Report: Netanyahu offering millions of dollars in cash rewards to...	Israeli prime minister pledging 'safe passage' out of Gaza and massive cash rewards to any terrorists holding captives who agrees to free hostages, according to report. By World Israel News Staff Israel is offering Gaza terrorists who are holding hostages captive large cash rewards and the promise of free passage out of the Gaza Strip for themselves and their families if they handover the hostages to Israel, Israel's Channel 12 reported Monday night. According to the report, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed security officials to offer a massive reward, totalling 'several million dollars' for each captive who is freed, along with guarantees of safe passage out of the Gaza Strip for any captors who agree to the deal. The prime minister reportedly authorized the offer to be made during a security meeting Monday night, following consultations on Sunday with Gal Hirsch, a IDF reserve Brigadier General tapped by the Israeli government to lead efforts aimed at securing the release of Israeli captives held in Gaza. On Tuesday, an Israeli official confirmed Monday night's report regarding the offer. Israeli intelligence currently estimates that only 51 out of 101 captives still held in the Gaza Strip are alive. During a closed-door session of the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in September, Netanyahu provided lawmakers with data gathered by the intelligence community regarding the condition of Israeli hostages in the Gaza Strip. Israel has officially declared 37 of the captives dead, though there is also information suggesting that at least 13 more have also died in captivity, though their deaths have not been confirmed. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken ripped the Hamas terror organization, saying the Gaza-based group is refusing to release even a small number of Israeli captives as part of a ceasefire deal. 'Hamas has once again refused to release even a limited number of hostages to secure a ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said, summarizing Blinken's comments from a call with Egypt's foreign minister.

Hamas used extensive cyber ops to crack IDF defenses before Octob...	Among the findings: Hamas hacked soldiers' phones, security cameras, to obtain sensitive information. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An IDF investigation into how Hamas knew so much about IDF bases and border security prior to its October 7 invasion is now complete, Channel 12 reported Monday evening, and the results are troubling. While there was no active betrayal by army personnel, security was not up to par, said the report. Hamas attained a great deal of information simply by going through social networks where soldiers posted pictures and statements about their bases and operational activities, with no oversight by any IDF department. This exposed both weaknesses that Hamas could exploit as well as provide the terrorists with targets to hit. For a full two years before the surprise attack in which 1,200 people were massacred, Hamas also broke into soldiers’ phones to obtain sensitive data by examining their photos and messages. The terrorists also set 'honey traps,' tempting soldiers to communicate with ostensible dates and thereby expose their phone numbers and contacts, or reveal information they shouldn’t. This specific phenomenon was publicized in the media, with the IDF clearly warning its troops not to fall for such attempts. In examining another aspect of information security, the researchers found that technical equipment bought from outside providers was hacked. This included thousands of base security cameras made in China, which Palestinian experts could break into in order to retrieve invaluable intelligence. Most of the report was classified, but a source familiar with its contents told the media outlet that 'The report was difficult and intense and &#8230; will lead to a dramatic change in the area of information security and how it is treated by the military.' Two other points mentioned in the broadcast but without any details due to their sensitivity was that the security of both senior IDF officers and of IDF bases was checked, and 'many shortcomings' were discovered that will 'necessitate great changes.' 'There needs to be an organizational transformation in the IDF but also a change of culture in order to change this behavior,' reporter Nir Dvori summed up. 'There’s no choice. It has to be a complete change, from one end to the other, with an entirely new system of information security.' The full IDF report will be presented in the coming days to Chief of Staff Lieut. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, he said.

Biden in talks with Saudis for security deal, leaving out Israeli...	Senior US and Saudi officials reportedly working to negotiate limited bilateral agreement, after Saudi Crown Prince rules out deal including peace with Israel in the immediate future. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration and the Saudi government are quietly negotiating a limited bilateral security agreement, setting aside long-standing aspirations for achieving a 'mega-deal' which would include normalized relations between Riyadh and Jerusalem, Axios reported Monday night. For years, Israel and Saudi Arabia have conducted closed-door talks aimed at reaching formal recognition between the two powers, extending the Abraham Accords and cementing acceptance of Israel by moderate, U.S.-aligned Arab states. The clandestine negotiations, brokered by the U.S., reached their apogee prior to last year's invasion of Israel by Gaza terrorists, after Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi prime minister and Crown Prince who is widely considered the de factor ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, came to the conclusion that a 'mega-deal' between Riyahd, Jerusalem, and Washington would only be politically viable during the Biden administration, Axios reported. The mega-deal would include not only the establishment of full diplomatic ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but also enhanced security cooperation between all three powers, a defense treaty between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, and a green-light to a Saudi civilian nuclear program. Following the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7th, however, bin Salman has ruled out a deal with Israel, reportedly saying that while an agreement could still be reached at a later date, it could not come until some time after Israel's war in Gaza has ended. According to a report by The Atlantic in September, when asked by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken what were the prerequisites for resuming efforts towards a normalization deal, bin Salman said that the war in Gaza must come to a conclusion and Israel leave Gaza. Now, according to Axios, the Biden administration and bin Salman are rushing to achieve a limited bilateral security agreement before the president leaves office on January 20th. The proposed agreement would not include provisions for a Saudi-Israeli deal, nor would it address Saudi Arabia's nuclear ambitions. Instead, the security agreement would be a scaled-down version of the treaty sought after as part of a mega-deal, and would be modeled on agreements inked between the U.S. and Gulf states including Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, cementing each's status as American allies. 'Saudi Arabia is part of that and likely to also have something,' one of three sources quoted by the report said. All three sources said that Saudi national security adviser Musaad bin Mohammed al-Aiban met with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and senior Biden advisers Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein during a visit to the White House last week. The sources claimed that during the meeting, the three discuss possible bilateral agreements aimed at strengthening ties with regard to security, technology, and trade.

Biden admin: Hamas unwilling to release even a handful of Israeli...	Biden administration blasts Hamas, says the terror group consistently refusing to release even a small number of Israeli captives in order to secure a ceasefire to provide relief to Gaza civilians. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration slammed the Hamas terror organization Monday, accusing the Gaza-based group of refusing to compromise in hostage deal talks. On Sunday, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone with his Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, to discuss the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, and efforts to secure a ceasefire on both fronts. A day later, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller issued a statement to reporters summarizing Blinken's conversation with Abdelatty. According to Miller, during their conversation, Blinken expressed to Abdelatty the White House's frustration with Hamas over the terror group's recalcitrance in hostage deal talks, accusing it of ruling out the release of any number of Israeli captives in exchange for a temporary ceasefire. The Secretary noted that Hamas has once again refused to release even a limited number of hostages to secure a ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza,' Miller said. Blinken also 'discussed the importance of establishing a path for the post-conflict period that provides governance, security, and reconstruction' in the Gaza Strip. The two leaders also discussed efforts to 'promote a diplomatic resolution' between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group which 'would enable civilians on both sides of the blue line to return to their homes with safety and security.' The American Secretary of State reiterated the Biden administration's ambitions for permanently ending the current war in the Gaza Strip, 'securing the release of all hostages, and increasing and sustaining the delivery of humanitarian assistance.' On Monday, Israel's Channel 12 reported that Mossad Director David Barnea has expressed pessimism regarding the prospects for a hostage deal with Hamas, telling relatives of Israeli captives held in Gaza that the chances for even a small deal 'are low.' Israel has sought to achieve an interim deal with Hamas in the past few days, following the killing of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar in October. Such a deal, according to media reports, would include the release of roughly four or five Israeli captives, the freeing of dozens of jailed Arab terrorists, and a limited truce.

Haaretz blasts own publisher for calling Palestinian terrorists ‘...	Amos Schocken’s remarks at a London conference shocked subscribers, who left by the hundreds. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News In a rare display of self-criticism, the editorial board of one of Israel’s most prominent newspapers took its publisher to task Monday after he called Palestinian terrorists 'freedom fighters' and demanded international sanctions against Israel's government. Amos Schocken, who has headed the Haaretz newspaper for over two decades, had headed a list of speakers giving fiercely anti-government speeches at a London conference the paper sponsored last week about the 'day after' Israel’s war against the Hamas and Hezbollah terror organizations. He falsely accused the government of crimes such as 'imposing a cruel apartheid regime on the Palestinian population,' supporting 'ethnic cleansing' and committing a 'second Nakba' in 'part of Gaza,' using the Arab word for 'disaster,' which is what Israel’s enemies call its victory in the War of Independence. He also called for sanctions against the government and its leaders who oppose a Palestinian state, as 'the only way to achieve' this desired goal. The kicker, however, was when he said, 'It dismisses the costs [to] both sides for defending the settlements while fighting the Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls terrorists.' This last statement shocked Israelis of all stripes, even loyal readers of the decidedly left-wing daily, hundreds of whom promptly cancelled their subscriptions in protest. Many advertisers, too, showed their opposition by dropping their orders with the paper. Several government ministries announced that they would 'suspend all existing agreements' and refuse to work with the paper in the future as well due to his 'extreme, baseless and false statements.' Schocken tried walking back the reference, first saying 'To remove all doubt, Hamas are not freedom fighters. October 7 was a horrific event and I wrote in the paper that its initiators and perpetrators must be severely punished.' He then wrote, 'I have rethought what I said in London. Many freedom fighters in the world and throughout history, perhaps also on the way to establishing the State of Israel, carried out terrible terrorist acts and hurt the innocent to achieve their goals. I should have said: Using terrorism is illegitimate. I erred when I didn’t say this.' The paper’s editorial made clear that this kind of apology was not good enough. 'Even in his clarification, Schocken erred,' the article said inpart. 'Throughout history, nations have waged armed struggle against oppressive occupiers to liberate themselves and achieve independence; not every armed struggle is terrorism. 'But the term ‘freedom fighter’ has a positive, even romantic, connotation, which could lead people to support illegitimate acts of violence. Those should be unacceptable in any way, shape or form.' Referring to the butchery of the Hamas-led invasion that ended 1,200 lives, it also said, 'Any organization that advocates the murder of women, children and the elderly is a terrorist organization, and its members are terrorists. They certainly aren't ‘freedom fighters.’' Haaretz co-owner Leonid Nevzlin had already taken to social media Sunday to harshly criticize Schocken. 'His recent statements at the Haaretz conference in London are appalling, unacceptable, and even inhumane, displaying profound insensitivity toward the victims of that terrible day, the casualties of the ongoing war, the hostages and their families, and the people of Israel as a whole,' he wrote, in part on his X account.

Joe Rogan endorses Donald Trump	Podcaster and comedian Joe Rogan publicly endorses former President Donald Trump on eve of presidential election during interview with billionaire Elon Musk. By World Israel News Staff Joe Rogan, a comedian and host of the world's most popular podcast, publicly endorsed former President Donald Trump on the eve of Tuesday's presidential election. In an interview released late Monday night, Rogan hosted billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who has campaigned on behalf of Trump and spent over $120 million on a pro-Trump political action committee. Musk, estimated by Forbes to be the world's richest person with a projected net worth of $269.8 billion, is the second largest donor for the Trump campaign and aligned super PACs, after billionaire Timothy Mellon, and ahead of Miriam Adelson. During the podcast, which lasted nearly two-hours-and-forty-minutes, both Musk and Rogan repeatedly criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, with Musk warning that a Harris victory would likely spell the end of American democracy. In a post to X/Twitter debuting the episode, Rogan wrote that he agreed with Musk 'every step of the way' regarding Trump, before explicitly endorsing the former president. The great and powerful Elon Musk,' Rogan tweeted. 'If it wasn't for him we'd be f***ed. He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.' 'For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump. Enjoy the podcast.' Rogan's podcast with Musk comes on the heels of an interview with Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, which aired last October. Trump also appeared on Rogan's podcast on October 25th, garnering over 20 million views on Rogan's X/Twitter account, and 45 million on Youtube. 'I just received word about Joe Rogan's endorsement,' Trump said in a video statement released to TikTok early Tuesday morning. 'He's a fantastic guy. And it is a great honor to receive it.'

New law streamlines firing of pro-terror teachers in Israel	One idea can be more destructive than a thousand tanks,' says MK who co-sponsored bill that cuts funding to terror-supporting schools. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli Knesset passed a bill on Tuesday clamping down on terror-supporting teachers and educational institutions, following a number of scandals involving educators celebrating terror attacks. The bill paves the way for educators who post pro-terror content to be swiftly fired and to slash funding to schools that promote terror-supporting narratives. The new law ensures that teacher who 'identify with an act of terrorism in public or publish a direct call to commit an act of terrorism' can be fired with no advance notice. Educators who promote pro-terror narratives are welcome to teach 'in Tehran, Gaza or Ramallah today, but not in our schools,' said Likud MK Amit HaLevi, a co-sponsor of the bill. MK Tvika Fogel (Religious Zionism), who introduced the bill, stressed that teachers have tremendous influence over children and youth. The law, he said, ensures that educator and schools are held accountable for the narratives being promoted to students. In recent years, several schools in eastern Jerusalem held ceremonies commemorating Palestinian terrorists. Under the new law, these schools could lose their funding from the Education Ministry due to the pro-terror curriculum. 'The Knesset today is doing the most essential thing in the war against our enemies: damaging the strongest infrastructure of terrorism - education,' he said in a media statement. 'As we know, a bomb is not created and does not explode by itself. Its basic components are the brain and the heart, the consciousness of destruction, and the emotional fervor to carry it out, and these are created first of all in the educational system,' he continued. 'One teacher may raise dozens of ticking bombs every year. One idea can be more destructive than a thousand tanks.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paised the law as 'important' for 'ending terrorism,' and emphasized that the government will 'continue to fight terrorism in every way.'

American Airlines won’t fly to Israel again until at least Septem...	The Israeli carrier El Al is currently the only airline offering direct flights between the United States and Israel. By Andrew Lapin, JTA American Airlines announced over the weekend it would not be resuming flights to Israel until September 2025, extending an existing pause by an additional six months and potentially sparking a cascade of other airline delays in resuming regular Israel service. The move makes American Airlines the first United States-based carrier to push back flights to Israel until at least the second half of 2025, amid a swath of cancellations affecting most non-Israeli airlines. Delta and its partner airlines currently have pauses on Israel flights through March, while United Airlines has not set a return date yet for its own Israel flights. Many carriers suspended flights to Israel following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack and have delayed their return to the region citing renewed security concerns including the expansion of regional conflict into Lebanon and Iran. Others resumed flights after Oct. 7 but suspended them amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, which has included multiple missile barrages from Iran. The scarcity of flights and their frequent interruptions have made traveling to and from Israel an expensive, often madcap process. To manage costs, many travelers are opting to fly first to a European city that has budget service before connecting to their final destination — although several budget European airlines, including EasyJet and Ryanair, have also suspended service to Israel through at least spring 2025. The Israeli carrier El Al is currently the only airline offering direct flights between the United States and Israel. El Al’s effective monopoly on the service since Oct. 7 resulted in an investigation over price gouging and a change in policy that locked in flight rates to and from some European cities. In a statement, a spokesperson for American Airlines told the Jewish News Syndicate that customers who had already bought flights could get a full refund or exchange them for another airline.

Harris will not say how she voted on California’s tough-on-crime ...	Proposition 36 would increase penalties for individuals convicted of retail theft or drug crimes by reclassifying the offenses from misdemeanors to felonies. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Vice President Kamala Harris refused to say how she voted on California’s Proposition 36, a ballot measure that would impose harsher sentences for retail thefts and drug crimes in her home state, CNN reported. 'I am not going to talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election, and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it,' she told reporters in Detroit when asked about the proposition. Harris had been speaking of submitting her vote, saying, 'I actually just filled out my mail-in ballot.' Proposition 36 would increase penalties for individuals convicted of retail theft or drug crimes by reclassifying the offenses from misdemeanors to felonies. It also proposes to elevate repeat shoplifting and fentanyl-related offenses to felony status. The initiative would reverse sections of Proposition 47, a controversial criminal reform initiative approved by voters in 2014 that lessened the penalties for theft and drug crimes in California to reduce overcrowding in jails, according to CNN. Supporters of Proposition 36 include GOP lawmakers and commercial chain stores, such as Walmart, that have been victims of record-high shoplifting since the pandemic. Opponents of the measure include Democratic state leaders and social justice organizations that argue the proposal would unfairly imprison lower-class people and those with a history of substance abuse. Since launching her presidential campaign, Harris has emphasized her record fighting crime as a California prosecutor while attempting to downplay her progressive policies. Harris has refused to say if she supports various of her previously held positions involving crime, such as closing private prisons, allowing taxpayer-funded sex-change surgeries for prisoners, decriminalizing prostitution, and creating a path to citizenship for 'dreamers,' illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children.

Blood sugar levels play a key role in brain aging: Can diet slow ...	According to the study, individuals at risk for cognitive decline should prioritize blood sugar management through diet and lifestyle choices. By Pesach Benson, TPS The body’s blood sugar level is known to be linked to brain atrophy, and now findings from a team of international researchers suggest that dieting can slow the brain’s aging process. Age-related brain atrophy, characterized by the gradual loss of neurons and shrinkage of brain tissue, is an inevitable aspect of aging. This decline can lead to various cognitive impairments and neurological issues. While aging cannot be halted, the results from this 18-month dietary intervention suggest that adopting a healthier lifestyle can mitigate some effects of brain aging. Brain age, determined through MRI assessments of the hippocampus and lateral ventricles, reflects the brain’s biological aging, which may not always align with a person’s chronological age. As individuals age, the hippocampus tends to shrink while the lateral ventricles expand, serving as indicators of brain health. A younger brain age generally signifies better cognitive functioning, whereas an older brain age can signal increased vulnerability to cognitive decline. The study, conducted by a collaborative team of brain and nutrition experts, including researchers from Ben-Gurion University, Harvard University, and Leipzig University, was recently published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2024, a peer-reviewed journal. The research was primarily led by Ben-Gurion PhD student Dafna Pachter and supervised by Prof. Iris Shai. According to the study, individuals at risk for cognitive decline should prioritize blood sugar management through diet and lifestyle choices. The findings indicate that lower levels of HbA1c — also known as glycated hemoglobin — correlates with significant positive changes in specific brain regions commonly affected by aging. MRI results demonstrated that lower HbA1c levels were associated with greater changes in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum—key areas responsible for cognitive function, motor control, and sensory processing. The research suggests that improved blood sugar management could be a pivotal factor in decelerating age-related brain changes. Earlier studies have highlighted the advantages of the Green Mediterranean diet, which is rich in polyphenols derived from plant-based sources like Mankai (a high-protein aquatic plant) and green tea, while being low in red and processed meats. The study reinforces the notion that the Green Mediterranean diet not only promotes metabolic health but may also offer protective benefits for brain structure and function. The DIRECT PLUS trial, noted for being one of the longest and largest brain MRI intervention studies, involved around 300 participants divided into three dietary groups. Whole-brain MRI measurements were taken before and after the 18-month trial to assess changes in brain health. Using Hippocampal Occupancy (HOC) as a proxy for brain age, the study predicted future dementia risk. Interestingly, some participants displayed brain ages that were either younger or older than their chronological ages. Employing NeuroQuant, an FDA-authorized automated tool, the research team quantified and analyzed the MRI data. The goal was to examine the impact of dietary components and glycemic control on brain aging. Results indicated that participants who improved their blood sugar levels and achieved normal glucose status showed a more pronounced reduction in brain aging. Notably, those who incorporated higher amounts of green tea and Mankai duckweed shakes into their diets experienced the most significant improvements in both blood sugar regulation and brain health. Lead researcher Prof. Iris Shai of Ben-Gurion University explained, 'Maintaining low blood sugar levels, even within the normal range, shows promise for preserving a younger brain, especially when combined with a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Polyphenols in plant-based foods may cross the blood-brain barrier, reducing inflammation crucial for memory.' This study is among the first large-scale trials to establish a direct connection between dietary changes, particularly those related to the Green Mediterranean diet, improved glycemic control, and slower brain aging. While further investigation is necessary, the research could encourage healthcare professionals to integrate nutritional counseling into their practices, emphasizing the role of diet in mental wellness.

Will Iran attack Israel on Election Night?	This time the regime will likely use up to 400 missiles if not more,' says Iranian military analyst. By World Israel News Staff A prominent Iranian military analyst is warning that there is a high likelihood Iran will attack Israel on Tuesday, as the U.S. presidential election results are tallied, in order to generate maximum publicity. Dr. Farzin Nadimi, a Senior Fellow with The Washington Institute, wrote on his X account that he believes Iran may launch a massive attack on the Jewish State in the immediate future. 'The newest round in the Iranian regime-Israel long-range fires war is near, perhaps on Tuesday evening as polls close in the U.S., to overshadow the winner announcement. This time the regime will likely use up to 400 missiles if not more, aiming at disabling major Israeli air defenses,' Nadimi wrote. Aligned with recent reports that Iran will include previously unused weapons in this attack, Nadimi said he expects to see Tehran launch Khorramshahr-4 ballistic missiles, which have a 2,000 kilometer range, the hypersonic Fattah missile which can reporedly evade Israel's air defenses, the Emad precision ballistic missile, and the medium-range Kheibar Shekan medium-range ballsitic missile. The name of the last missile, the Kheibar, is a reference to a Muslim mass slaughter of Jews in Saudi Arabia during the first century. The Arash suicide drone is also likely to be used by Iran during the attack, Nadimi added. The analyst noted that some of Iran's ballistic missiles are actually located in Iraq, shortening the distance that the weapons need to travel to strike Israel. Earlier reports indicated that Iran may activate its proxy groups in Iraq to carry out the attack, in order to create plausible deniability and avoid an Israeli reliatory srike on Iranian soil. The U.S. warned Iran that should it launch an additional attack against Israel, it would not be able to prevent the Jewish State from striking Iran's nuclear development sites and oil assets. According to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv, the Israeli military is on high alert for a potential attack.

‘Credible threat’ – Iranian plot to kill IAF commander revealed	Iran was said to be asking the Israelis in its network to find an assassin who would be willing to murder the commander. By World Israel News Staff An Iranian plot to assassinate an Israeli Air Force commander has sent shockwaves throughout the military, with security officials providing the officer in question and his family a special security detail. Assigning personal security guards to a senior officer 'is not a standard procedure for everyone,' an anonymous Israeli official told Iran International, a news outlet affiliated with the anti-Islamic regime movement. 'Only those with a [credible] threat [against] them, such as the chief of staff, the Air Force chief' receive round-the-clock security, 'but now they put security on [the officer] and his family as he was exposed.' The plan was exposed after the Shin Bet busted an Iranian spy ring, which consisted of mostly Soviet-born Israelis who had been recruited on social media platform Telegram to pass intelligence to Tehran in exchange for payment. Iran was said to be asking the Israelis in its network to find an assassin who would be willing to murder the commander. A commander at the Nevatim Air Force base in Israel's south, who has not been officially identified by name, was reportedly the target of the assassination plot. Hebrew-language Channel 12 news claimed that the officer targeted by Iran is Brig. Gen. Yotam Sigler, the commander of Nevatim, but that has not been officially confirmed by the Shin Bet or military. 'The commander is a very wanted target because Nevatim is in itself so strong a target for Iran,' the Israeli official explained. Nevatim is one of the largest military bases in Israel, where fighter jets, stealth aircraft for intelligence gathering, and the Prime Minister's private jet, the Wing of Zion, are stationed. 'It’s not just fighters, it’s intelligence, it’s multi-disciplinary and a strategic base,' the source added. Iran targeted Nevatim in both its April and October on the Jewish State, which saw Tehran launch hundreds of explosive drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles at Israel. During the first attack in April, Nevatim only sustained minor damage. But following the October attack, satellite images revealed that serious damage had been inflicted upon runways at Nevatim, as well a hangar. In a statement, the IDF said the Iranian attack had damaged 'office buildings and other maintenance areas,' but stressed that no soldiers or aircraft were struck.

Gantz pressures Netanyahu: ‘Israel must be ready to destroy Irani...	Iran's attacks will ultimately end in damage to its military capabilities, collapse of its economy, and a popular revolt against power.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News National Unity Party chairman Benny Gantz had a message for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: Be ready to strike and eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities. At a party faction meeting, Gantz said, 'We will have to prepare politically, economically, and militarily for the destruction of Iran's nuclear facilities and to fight against its expansion. ' He acknowledged the other challenges Israel is facing, such as protecting its borders, ongoing military action in Gaza and Lebanon, and tens of thousands of evacuees who still are prevented from returning home.

Before Israel's retaliation strike on Iran's military sites, such as missile production facilities, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told President Joe Biden that Israel would refrain from striking Iran's nuclear program as well as its oil and natural gas reserves and infrastructure, The pledge was conveyed during a phone call between the two leaders, the first time they had spoken in many weeks. The strike was in retaliation for Iran launching 182 missiles into Israel in early October. Biden administration pressured Israel to restrain its response and, in particular, urged Jerusalem not to strike either Iranian nuclear facilities nor Iranian oil and natural gas sites or infrastructure, warning that such attacks could lead to a major escalation in the region.

Biden administration pressured Israel to restrain its response and, in particular, urged Jerusalem not to strike either Iranian nuclear facilities nor Iranian oil and natural gas sites or infrastructure, warning that such attacks could lead to a major escalation in the region. The sources cited by the Post indicated that Netanyahu's decision to embrace a 'more moderate' approach was tied to the White House's decision to send Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense units to Israel to bolster Israel's missile defense network.

Russia behind plot to put incendiary devices on US and Canada-bou...	The group's goal was also to test the transfer channel for such parcels, which were ultimately to be sent to the United States of America and Canada.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Two incendiary devices transported by DHL were part of a Russian plot to start fires on cargo or passenger planes headed to the US and Canada, the Wall Street Journal reports. The current plot shows an escalation of previous suspected attacks in July when devices set fires at DHL logistics hubs in England and Germany. Since the incidents in July, security officials have been searching to find the culprit and have now determined that Russia was behind the planting of incendiary devices, according to the Wall Street Journal. The devices were electric massagers filled with a magnesium-based flammable substance, which would be difficult to extinguish if ignited on an airplane. Poland's National Prosecutor's Office has arrested four people in connection with the fires and has charged them with terrorist actions on behalf of a foreign intelligence agency. 'The group's goal was also to test the transfer channel for such parcels, which were ultimately to be sent to the United States of America and Canada,' the prosecutor's office said. Pawel Szota, the head of Poland's Foreign Intelligence Agency, said Russian agents were responsible for the plot to plant the devices, and if an attack had been put into action, it would represent a significant escalation from the incidents in the summer. Szota said, 'I'm not sure the political leaders of Russia are aware of the consequences if one of these packages exploded, causing a mass casualty event.' When the Wall Street Journal asked Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to comment on the incident, he replied, 'We have never heard any official accusations' of Russian involvement, adding: 'These are traditional unsubstantiated insinuations from the media.' European authorities have noted that Russia is behind an increasing number of cases of sabotage, including arson in the UK and Finland, tampering with pipelines and data cables in the Baltic, and interfering with water supplies in Sweden and Finland.

After warship seen in Suez, IDF says assets in ‘multiple arenas’	The video shows the ship flying both Israeli and Egyptian flags in accordance with regulations requiring that the host nation’s flag be flown next to that of the transiting vessel. By Joshua Marks, JNS After an Israeli warship was spotted transiting the Suez Canal over the weekend, the IDF said on Monday that Israeli naval forces were deployed in 'multiple arenas.' Vessel rotations occur 'according to plans and in line with ongoing situational assessments,' the IDF said in reply to a JNS inquiry. On Saturday, video of what appeared to be an Israeli Navy Sa’ar 5 class missile corvette passing through the canal was widely circulated on the Internet. The Sa’ar 5 was recently succeeded by the Sa’ar 6-class, manufactured for the Israeli Navy by Germany.

A small crowd of onlookers can be seen observing the unusual scene, with two smaller Egyptian police boats escorting the vessel. IDF sailors can be seen standing on the deck. While Egypt has maintained a peace treaty with Israel since 1979, it has been described as a 'cold peace,' with the government in Cairo and on the Egyptian street often hostile toward Jerusalem. Despite this, Cairo has been one of the leading mediators in the year-long negotiations over the release of Israeli hostages kidnapped in the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7, 2023. The initial outrage over the video prompted the Suez Canal Authority to issue a statement on Sunday. قناة السويس تلتزم بتطبيق اتفاقية القسطنطينية التي تكفل حرية الملاحة بالقناة دون تمييز لجنسية السفن العابرة رداً على ما تم تداوله من تساؤلات على بعض منصات التواصل الاجتماعي حول قيام هيئة قناة السويس بالسماح بعبور السفن الحربية pic.twitter.com/SXX3TAnC5k &mdash; هيئة قناة السويس Suez Canal Authority (@SuezAuthorityEG) November 1, 2024 'In response to questions raised on some social media platforms about the Suez Canal Authority allowing warships of different nationalities to cross the Maritime Channel, the Suez Canals Authority affirms its commitment to the implementation of international conventions that guarantee the freedom of navigation for ships passing the Channel, whether they are commercial or war vessels, without discrimination,' the Egyptian state-owned authority said. 'The citizenship of the ship is in accordance with the articles of the Constantine Agreement, which constitute an essential guarantee to maintain the channel’s status as the most important maritime passage in the world,' the statement continued.

More than 50 Orthodox rabbis endorse Trump	For the first time ever, a former Chief Rabbi endorsed a US presidential candidate. By World Israel News One day after the Harris campaign announced that 33 'Orthodox rabbis' had endorsed her candidacy, more than 50 Orthodox rabbis signed the following letter, firmly backing President Trump. After 12 hours: 40 Orthodox Rabbis for @realDonaldTrump After 5 days: 33 'Orthodox Rabbis' for Kamala Let's go for the landslide: &mdash; Tuly Weisz (@tulyweisz) November 4, 2024 'As Orthodox rabbis, we believe that Vice President Kamala Harris will continue the dangerous positions of the Biden administration that contributed to the deadly Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthi and Iranian attacks on Israel. Her constant calls for a ceasefire and a two-state solution, and chas v'shalom (God forbid), the likelihood of her withholding even more weapons from the IDF, presents a significant risk of Pikuach Nefesh endangering Jewish lives. As Torah observant Jews, we gratefully have Hakarat Hatov (gratitude) that President Trump pulled out of the JCPOA (Iran nuclear deal) and crippled Iran's economy, cut funding to the terrorist enabling UNRWA, signed into law and enforced the Taylor Force Act, visited and prayed at the Kotel, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and established the Abraham Accords. Therefore, we endorse former President Trump who did more for Israel and the Jewish people during his first term than any other president and pray that Hashem (God, literally ‘the name’) grants him a second term to bring security and prosperity to America, Israel and the entire world.' The rabbis signed as individuals and not on behalf of their synagogues or community roles, similar to how the original letter was posted by Rabbi Shmuly Yankelowitz, who also has photos of him posing with Vice President Kamala Harris on his social media. Group of 33 Orthodox rabbis signed letter of support for Harris. 'While one can certainly engage in debate regarding certain policies, the risks posed by former President Trump’s character make clear to us as Torah-abiding Jews that we should support VP Kamala Harris.' pic.twitter.com/b0kEfiAUgi &mdash; Jacob N. Kornbluh (@jacobkornbluh) November 3, 2024 The Orthodox rabbis were responding to an endorsement of Harris issued by 33 'Orthodox rabbis.' Rabbi Tuly Weisz, who wrote the pro-Trump letter and organized the petition, remarked. 'I saw Rabbi Yankelowitz’s letter and was immediately appalled. As someone intimately familiar with the American rabbinate, I could easily see that most of the 33 'Orthodox rabbis' are neither Orthodox, nor rabbis,' said Weisz. 'Quite a few are woke academics and left wing activists. Many have views that are completely incompatible with Orthodox Judaism. The fact that these are the only ones who would sign an 'Orthodox Rabbis for Kamala' letter shows just how little support there is among the Orthodox Jewish community for an extension of the Biden administration.' Journalist Daniel Greenfield, whose X handle is @Sultanknish, posted a detailed list: Dems Claim 33 'Orthodox Rabbis' signed letter in support of Kamala 9 are women. Orthodox Judaism does not ordain women. Rabbi Shamir Caplan appears to be an Australian clergyman in Melbourne who endorses gay marriage Michael Langer was a fellow of the anti-Israel T'ruah hate… pic.twitter.com/59cOXIvvHN &mdash; Daniel Greenfield - 'Hang Together or Separately' (@Sultanknish) November 4, 2024 Indeed, while a recent poll by the Jewish Democratic Council of America claimed that 68% of Jewish voters were planning to vote for Harris in the upcoming election, 83% of Orthodox Jews voted for Trump in 2020. Author of the best-selling book, 'The War Against the Bible,' Rabbi Elie Mischel explained, 'Understandably, most rabbis are afraid to make political statements that might anger some of their congregants. But this election is different. If Kamala Harris becomes president instead of Donald Trump, the consequences could be catastrophic: arms embargoes on Israel, devastating sanctions on Israelis opposed to a Palestinian state, and worst of all, more dead Jews. This is not about Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal. It’s about the safety of Israel. If rabbis can’t find the courage to speak up now as we fight for our very existence, when will they?' Other Orthodox rabbis explained the endorsement of President Trump. Executive Director at the Herzl Institute, Rabbi Rafi Eis remarked, 'Trump's first term saw global calm, improved national spirit, and better economic conditions for Americans. Iran and its allies were diminished. The Biden/Harris administration has been filled with global chaos, the worst Middle East conflict in decades, and punishing inflation. Instead of sanctioning Iran, they give it money. 'They diminish America's national spirit and America's citizens seem to be helped last. We don't need to imagine what a Trump or Harris administration would do, they have already shown us. Trump's results are better on all accounts.' Rabbi Pesach Lerner, President Emeritus of the Coalition for Jewish Values, explained, 'Why do Orthodox Rabbis endorse Former President Trump? Simple. He’s good for Israel. He’s good for the US economy. He’s good for family values. He’s good for US energy. He’s good for a strong and safe America. He’s good for American and world stability. The better question is, how could Orthodox Rabbis and others not endorse him?' According to Rabbi Yitzchak Adlerstein, 'As Iman Ali (8th century) said in hadith 295 of Nahj al-Balagha, my enemy's enemy is my friend. If both the Iranians and Rashida Tlaib, Congress' Anti Semite in Chief, viscerally hate Donald Trump, I know that he is the best choice for Israel. 'Virtually all Americans vote for the candidate that they feel best addresses their concerns and priorities, and I am no different. For me, the survival of the Jewish people and the welfare of the State of Israel top my list of concerns. As an actual resident of Israel, I am ripped apart daily by stories of brave soldiers who have died, leaving behind widows and orphans. 'I can't forget for an instant that the billions of dollars released to Iran by the Biden-Harris administration- money that Donald Trump had frozen -helped fund the terrorists who killed them.' According to Rabbi Pini Dunner of the Beverly Hills Synagogue, 'The primary reason for my choice of presidential candidate is their stance on Israel. In this election there is no choice - Donald Trump has made it clear that he has Israel's back every step of the way, and that's all that matters. 'Harris is surrounded by Israel-haters and people who make excuses for terrorism. If elected, she will be a disaster for Israel.' According to Rabbi Ze'ev Smason, who serves as Midwestern Regional Vice President of the Coalition for Jewish Values, 'As president, Donald Trump moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognized Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights. 'Rather than alienating Arab allies, Donald Trump delivered the momentous peace agreements of the Abraham Accords. Donald Trump also ignored the professional peace processors and appeasers, and focused on stopping Iran. 'Kamala Harris sees the world differently. Along with President Biden, she stopped enforcing oil sanctions in a bid for Iran’s goodwill. Since January 2021, this has brought Iran more than $40 billion in extra revenue, emboldening Iran and providing funding for its support of evil proxies such as Hamas and Hezbollah. 'A Trump administration will be solidly pro-Israel. A Harris administration will reflect most of today’s Democratic Party: hostile to Israel’s government and increasingly hostile to Israel’s security needs, with a sizable wing hostile to Israel’s existence.' 'As Jews committed to Torah values, we need American leadership whose priority is the safety, security and prosperity of the United States and its citizens, keeping woke ideology out of our schools, and who has demonstrated a rock-solid commitment to the State of Israel and an exceptionally warm friendship to the Jewish People. Donald Trump is clearly this man!' said Rabbi Avrohom Gordimer of New York. Rabbi Mordechai Cohen of Baltimore, MD explained his endorsement, 'For four years, President Trump showed his love and respect for Israel. Utilizing unabashed pro Israel advisors, President Trump was able to secure peace treaties and maintain a general peace in the Middle East. 'His crowning moment was when he recognized the holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved the US Embassy there. 'With a Trump win, Iran will be curtailed, Hezbollah and the Youthis would be rendered harmless and the Middle East would again be a strong and peaceful region. Rabbi Ephraim Slepoy commented, 'As an American, there is no better choice to restore greatness to our country than DONALD TRUMP. As a Jew, there is no better friend and unconditional supporter of Israel than DONALD TRUMP.' Other prominent Orthodox rabbis also came out in favor of Trump. Rabbi Shmuel Kaminetsky, the famed dean of the Philadelphia Yeshiva, located in the Swing State of Pennsylvania offered a rare blessing for Donald Trump. Two days before Election Day, Rabbi Kaminetsky told Belaaz, 'I’m blessing that President Trump should win the election.' For the first time ever, a former Chief Rabbi endorsed a US presidential candidate. Rabbi David Lau wrote in a letter to President Trump: 'Your policies have shown the world that the bond between the Jewish people and their land is not temporary but rather a fundamental enduring part of human history. 'As a religious leader and former Chief Rabbi of Israel, I particularly value your dedication to religious freedom and interfaith respect… 'Speaking for myself and countless others who recognize your contributions to both the free world and Israel, I sincerely hope you will continue to lead with the same vision and determination that has characterized your previous service. 'As you approach the upcoming election, you have my blessings for success.'

Israeli Air Force intercepts drones fired from Iraq	Iranian-backed militias took responsibility for the launches. By JNS The Israeli Air Force intercepted several drones launched from Iraq at Israeli territory on Monday, according to the Israeli military. No sirens sounded as the UAVs were shot down before threatening any population centers. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella organization composed of several Iranian-backed Shi’ite militias under the command of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, claimed responsibility for the launches. Earlier on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces said that two drones were fired from Iraq and two from Lebanon, and that all four were intercepted. Two of the UAVs were intercepted after infiltrating into Israeli territory and two were shot down outside of Israel’s border. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which includes Kata’ib Hezbollah, Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba and Kata’ib Sayyid al-Shuhadaa, has been launching daily drone attacks at Israel since the Hamas-led massacre in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. A regional security official told the Associated Press last week that the drone attacks have increased in recent weeks, with an average of five a day and eight drones launched over a 24-hour period in the past week. Israel has warned the Iraqi government that unless it reins in Iranian-backed militias, it could face strikes, according to the Saudi website Elaph. Israel has identified and is monitoring targets belonging to the Iranian-backed militias and also Iraqi state targets and could start attacking them if the militias keep firing at the Jewish state, according to the report. Unnamed officials told Elaph that satellites are monitoring the movement of ballistic missiles and related equipment from Iran to Iraq, which could be used in an attack on Israel. An Iranian official told the Wall Street Journal on Sunday that part of a planned attack against Israel could be launched from Iraqi territory. Iran’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaee said at a press conference on Monday that 'we would employ all of physical and intellectual capabilities to respond to the Zionist regime,' speaking in response to a question about a potential Iranian attack on Israel from Iraqi soil, according to the semi-official Tasnim News Agency, a Tehran-based media outlet associated with the IRGC.

Three-quarters of Israelis favor Trump over Harris on eve of elec...	On the eve of the presidential election, new poll shows overwhelming majority of Israeli Jews say that a Trump victory would be better for Israel than a Harris win. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The vast majority of Israelis believe that Israel would be better off if former President Donald Trump wins tomorrow's presidential election than if his rival, Vice President and 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris were to emerge victorious, a new poll shows, The survey was conducted by the Israel's Democracy Institute's Viterbi Family Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research, polling Israeli Jews and Arabs. The results of the poll were released on Monday, a day before the presidential election. According to the poll, 72% of Israeli Jews say that a second Trump presidency would be better for Israel than a Harris presidency. Just 11% of Jewish respondents said that Israel would be better off with Harris in office. Arab Israelis, on the other hand, are roughly evenly divided, with 46% of Arab respondents saying that they saw no significant difference between the two candidates vis-a-vis Israel. Of those who did see a difference, 27% said Trump would be better for Israel, compared to 22.5% who said Harris would be better for Israel. Younger Israelis were more likely to see Trump as being more beneficial for Israel, with 90% of Israeli Jews between the ages of 18 and 34 saying Israel would be better off with Trump in office than with Harris, compared to only 2% who said Israel would benefit more with a Harris presidency. Among respondents over 55, 55% say Trump would be better for Israel, compared to 22% who said Harris would be more beneficial. Harris leads among self-described Israeli leftists, of whom 42% said Harris would be better for Israel, compared to 29% who said that Trump would be better. Trump leads among centrist Israeli Jews, 52% to 14% who said Harris would be better for Israel, while among right-wing Israelis, 90% said Trump would be better for Israel, with just 3% saying Harris would be better for the Jewish state. Last Monday, Israel's Channel 12 published a poll conducted by Midgam which found that 66% of Israelis, including both Jews and Arabs, say they prefer Trump in the White House, compared to just 17% who said they favored Harris.

Netanyahu: ‘We don’t need Hezbollah deal to reclaim the north’	Explosive drone impact triggers security officials to make last-minute change to Prime Minister Netanyahu's itinerary. By World Israel News Staff An explosive drone impacted in Metula on Monday morning, just twenty minutes before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was slated to tour the town, which borders Lebanon. After the explosion, security officials changed Netanyahu's itinerary and he did not visit the town as had been originally planned. Embattled Metula is perhaps the community that's been hardest hit by the near-daily missile, rocket, and drone launches by Hezbollah. Recent estimates indicate that some 50 percent of the homes in Metula have been damaged or destroyed October 7th, 2023. Nearly all of the residents of the twon were evacuated in the days after the Hamas massacres and have been displaced from their homes for more than a year, with no return date in sight. While touring elsewhere in the north, Netanyahu stressed that the IDF will continue fighting to reclaim the north. The premier said that Israel is prioritizing the return of internally displaced people to northern communities and will fight Hezbollah to achieve that goal, as the U.S> seeks to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. Critics have noted that the Lebanese state does not have the power to rein in the Hezbollah terror group, so negotiations with the country are pointless. 'With or without an agreement, the key to restoring calm and security is first to push Hezbollah beyond the Litani River,' Netanyahu said. He added that the IDF is working to ensure that Hezbollah cannot regroup and rearm, and that the military is prime to 'respond decisively to any action against us.' Netanyahu said that after a year of Hezbollah bombardment on the north, there has been a change in both the reality on the ground and the direction of the war.In simple terms: enforcement, enforcement, enforcement – and cutting off Hezbollah’s supply line from Iran through Syria. We are fully committed to these goals.' 'On the northern border, one can see and hear&#8230;. our aircraft above and our brave fighters below, across the border, dismantling Hezbollah’s entire underground terror network that was prepared for an invasion into the Galilee and a massacre even worse than what happened' in southern Israel on October 7th, Netanyahu said. 'Our heroic reservists play a crucial role in our achievements. They put their lives on hold, leave their families, lose work and sometimes, tragically, lose friends. I just met with them, and their readiness and fighting spirit are deeply inspiring,' he added.

After Supreme Court orders drafting of yeshiva students, IDF form...	IDF reportedly in the midst of forming its first all-religious combat brigade, months after the Supreme Court ordered the military to begin drafting ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military is in the midst of forming its first, all-religious combat brigade, months after the Supreme Court ordered the IDF to begin drafting ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students. In June, Israel’s Supreme Court handed down a precedent-setting decision, overturning the government’s decision to continue to issue annual draft deferments to full-time yeshiva students and to fund students relying on the deferments despite the court’s striking down of the draft law in 2017. Following the ruling, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara instructed the IDF to immediately implement the ruling by drafting 3,000 ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students. Now the IDF is preparing for the large-scale induction of ultra-Orthodox men with the formation of an entire combat brigade for religious soldiers. According to a report by Israel Hayom on Monday, the IDF is remodelling an army base in the Jordan Valley to the tune of $46 million to provide a center of operations for the new brigade. The renovated base will include four synagogues and other accoutrements to serve the religious needs of the incoming ultra-Orthodox soldiers. The brigade's first soldiers will begin arriving at the base in December, according to the report, with the brigade slated to become combat operational in November 2025. Currently, the only all-ultra-Orthodox combat unit in the IDF is Netzah Yehuda, better known as 'Nahal Haredi,' a battalion in the Kfir Brigade. In addition to the new army brigade, Israel is working to establish an ultra-Orthodox company within the Border Police, along with an aircraft maintenance division in the Israel Air Force. The planning of the new brigade has been conducted in conjunction with prominent rabbinic leaders in the ultra-Orthodox community, including Rabbi Moshe Hillel Hirsch.

RNC Spokesperson – Trump will protect American Jews and Israel be...	Elizebeth Pipko says the Republican nominee will continue his first term’s 'unequivocal' support for the Jewish state. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The national spokesperson for the Republican National Committee (RNC) told The Jerusalem Post Monday that if Donald Trump is elected again as president Tuesday, both American Jewry and Israel would be much safer than they would if Vice President Kamala Harris wins. Elizabeth Pipko spoke of the fear that many Jews she knows personally feel due to the rising antisemitism being openly and violently propagated in the U.S. since the Hamas-led invasion of Israel 13 months ago set off the ongoing war in Gaza, and how the hatred was not being addressed properly by the current administration. 'It is not difficult for most to recognize that the leadership of Kamala Harris failed when it came to our protection and that the Democrat party of our parents and grandparents no longer exists,' she said. 'This election should come down to the safety and protection of our loved ones. Because nothing else can matter when that is at risk.' This, she told the paper, definitely includes taking action to protect students in dozens of colleges where anti-Israel protestors have used both verbal and physical violence against Jewish classmates whom they assume support the Jewish state in its war against Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists. Trump has 'vowed to pull support from any universities pushing antisemitic propaganda and putting our young Americans at risk,' she noted. Pipko, a Harvard graduate who calls herself a 'proud, religious Jew,' has also come out against her alma mater for its administration’s kowtowing to the anti-Israel agitators on campus instead of punishing those who have broken university policies and often, the law, with their actions. As for Israel, she pointed to the former president’s first term in office, when he 'unequivocally stood by Israel, our greatest ally, and always stood strong in the face of evil terrorism and those who wanted to cause harm to the American people.' After Iran attacked Israel directly for the second time last month, firing 180 ballistic missiles at the Jewish state which caused some damage but no loss of life as they were shot down by the IDF and other forces, mainly American, Trump had advocated for Jerusalem to respond by hitting Iranian nuclear sites. President Joe Biden had warned against striking them, and Trump reacted at a campaign event by saying, 'That's the thing you want to hit right?&#8230; It's the biggest risk we have, nuclear weapons, the power of nuclear weapons. When they asked him that question the answer should have been, 'Hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later.'' This support for acting against the state that bankrolls and supplies so many advanced weapons and missiles to the Islamic terror proxies Israel is currently battling, could be of enormous significance if Trump prevails in what is considered a very tight race for the presidency. Pipko, a 29-year-old former model and cofounder of The Exodus Movement that encourages Jews to leave the Democratic party, their traditional political home, assumed her post in May. She is the first Jewish spokesperson for the RNC.

Israel kills Islamic Jihad terrorist involved in October 7th mass...	Ahmed Al-Dalu, who took part in the massacre of Israelis at Kibbutz Kfar Azza on October 7th, was eliminated in an IDF airstrike. By World Israel News Staff In a targeted Israeli airstrike, a senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) military intelligence official involved in the atrocities of October 7th was killed. According to a statement released by an IDF spokesperson Monday, Islamic Jihad’s Ahmed Al-Dalu was involved in the October 7, 2023 massacre at the border town of Kibbutz Kfar Azza, and had orchestrated several terror operations targeting Israeli civilians since the onset of the current war. Al-Dalu was killed alongside another Islamic Jihad terrorist in the air raid, the Israeli military said. The IDF spokesperson’s office also reported Monday morning that ground forces from the 162nd and 252nd divisions are actively engaging in operations throughout the Gaza Strip, and have killed a number of terrorist operatives as they work to dismantle terror infrastructure through both close-quarters combat and coordinated airstrikes. Nahal Brigade troops are currently operating in Rafah, in southern Gaza, where they have eliminated a number of terrorists in the ongoing anti-terror sweep. In a recent strike, the brigade directed an airstrike against a terror cell sheltering in a military building housing mines intended for attacks on Israeli forces, eliminating the cell and destroying the mines. Simultaneously, Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon targeted Abu Ali Rida, a Hezbollah commander in the Baraachit area. Rida, responsible for rocket and anti-tank missile attacks on IDF troops and overseeing Hezbollah operatives in the region, was killed in the strike. IDF troops continue to conduct precision raids in southern Lebanon, aimed at dismantling terrorist infrastructure, seizing weapons, and eliminating enemy operatives. In one raid, IDF forces struck a militant operating from a structure near the border, resulting in a series of secondary explosions, suggesting the presence of stored weaponry.

David Barnea, the head of Israel's Mossad and the top Israeli negotiator in hostage talks with Hamas, tells families of Israeli captives held in Gaza that the prospects of reaching a deal with the terrorist group are not encouraging. By World Israel News Staff Israel will in all likelihood be unable to reach a hostage deal with the Hamas terrorist organization a senior Israeli intelligence official and head of Israel's negotiating team told the families of captives still held in the Gaza Strip, according to a Hebrew-language report Monday morning. Israel's Channel 12 reported that Mossad Director David Barnea, who has headed up Israel's negotiating team in Doha, Qatar, met several days ago with relatives of Israeli captives still held in the Gaza Strip to update them on the efforts to secure the release of their loved ones. According to the report, Barnea attempted to lower expectations, telling the relatives that while hostage talks have been renewed in Doha following the killing of Hamas politburo chief Yahya Sinwar, he believes that the chances of ever achieving an agreement with Hamas are low. 'What's going on with the deal at the moment?' the relative of a hostage asked Barnea recently. 'I still haven't gotten an official answer from the mediator, not to the Qatari proposal, nor to the Egyptian proposal, and therefore it pays to wait,' Barnea responded. 'At the moment, the chances for a small deal are low, Hamas is insisting on ending the war.' Barnea emphasized that the Israeli team negotiating in Doha had no received permission from the government to entertain proposals to end the war against Hamas nor to surrender control of the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian - Gaza border, though alternative arrangements for the strategic area could be considered. The Channel 12 report also quoted a senior defense official who said that even after the elimination of Sinwar - considered among the most hawkish members of the terror organization - Hamas is unlikely to soften its demands for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, both of which Israel has already rejected. 'The time has come to face the reality. If you want to achieve the goal of returning the hostages, you have to close up shop in Gaza and work for a framework that will ensure the State of Israel's security interests in the future.'

Jewish man executed in Iran	20-year-old Arvin Nathaniel Ghahremani hanged in Iranian jail, after being convicted of murder over a killing he claimed was done in self-defense. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News An Iranian Jewish man was executed in a prison in western Iran Monday morning, according to a report by a human rights organization. On Monday, Iran Human Rights, which monitors human rights abuses by the Islamic regime and tracks executions, said that 20-year-old Arvin Nathaniel Ghahremani had been put to death Monday. According to the Iran Human Rights report, Ghahremani was hanged at Kermanshah Central Prison. Iranian authorities arrested Ghahremani in 2022, when the then-18-year-old was involved in a fatal brawl with a Muslim man in Kermanshah. Ghahremani and his supporters say that the killing was a case of self-defense, claiming that the Muslim man had charged Ghahremani while brandishing a knife. According to court transcripts, the incident occurred while Ghahremani was working out at a gym, when he was accosted by seven Muslim men, including who owed him money. One of the assailants, Amir Shokri, stabbed Ghahremani, but was killed when Ghahremani managed to grab the knife and wound some of his attackers. Despite the circumstances, a local court pronounced Ghahremani guilty of murder, sentencing him to death. A loophole in Iran's Sharia law would have permitted the state to forgo the death penalty if Ghahremani's family could have secured the forgiveness of the Shokri family. This May, Ghahremani's execution was postponed amid efforts to pay the family to support dropping the death penalty. The Shokri family refused the entreaties, however, and attempts to petition the court to grant a retrial failed. 'Jews in the US and other countries raised funds amounting to over $1.5 million, including an offer of an apartment and the building of a mosque in the name of the dead Muslim man,' Beni Sabti, an Iranian-born scholar at the Institute for National Security Studies in Israel told The Jerusalem Post in May. 'It seems that they did not agree.'

Israel cancels agreement recognizing UNRWA	Despite the overwhelming evidence we submitted to the U.N. that substantiate Hamas’ infiltration of UNRWA, the U.N. did nothing to rectify the situation,' tweeted Danon. By JNS Israel has terminated the 1967 agreement outlining the terms of its relations with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), a week after the Knesset passed legislation banning the organization’s operations in the Jewish state. 'UNRWA, whose employees took part in the October 7 massacre and many of whose workers are Hamas operatives, is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip, not part of the solution,' according to a statement released by Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Monday. 'The U.N. was provided with countless pieces of evidence regarding Hamas operatives who work at UNRWA and about the use of UNRWA facilities for terrorism, and nothing was done,' he added. 'Don’t believe those claiming there is no substitute for UNRWA. Already, the vast majority of humanitarian aid [in Gaza] is delivered through other organizations, only 13 percent is delivered through UNRWA,' the statement continued. 'The State of Israel is bound by international law and will continue to allow the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza in a manner that will not harm the security of the citizens of Israel,' wrote Katz. Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon welcomed the move, and reiterated Jerusalem’s commitment to providing aid to the Palestinians. 'Despite the overwhelming evidence we submitted to the U.N. that substantiate Hamas’ infiltration of UNRWA, the U.N. did nothing to rectify the situation,' tweeted Danon. 'The State of Israel will continue to cooperate with humanitarian organizations but not with organizations that promote terrorism against us,' he added. Following the legislation on UNRWA, the State of Israel officially notified the President of the General Assembly of the termination of cooperation with the agency.

Following the Knesset’s vote, the Israeli Foreign Ministry called the Palestinian refugee agency 'rotten.' 'It is not just a few rotten apples, as U.N. Secretary-General [Antonio] Guterres is trying to claim. UNRWA in Gaza is a rotten tree entirely infected with terrorist operatives,' the ministry stated at the time. 'Hamas has infiltrated UNRWA in Gaza widely and deeply,' the statement continued. 'UNRWA employees were involved in the horrific 7 October massacre. Moreover, Israel handed over to the U.N. details about an additional 100 Hamas operatives who are employed by UNRWA, yet UNRWA has not taken any measures to handle the issue, and is not moving forward with any serious steps to deal with the terrorist operatives in its ranks.' The U.S. State Department expressed 'deep concern' over the legislation, emphasizing UNRWA’s role in delivering aid to Gaza. The Biden administration has stepped up pressure on Jerusalem to meet a host of demands focused on vastly expanding the entry of humanitarian aid into the Strip. Last month, the White House confirmed an Axios report that Washington had sent a letter to Israel containing an ultimatum: Improve the humanitarian conditions in the Palestinian enclave within 30 days or risk a hold-up in the supply of U.S. weapons.

‘Breach of protocol’: WH press officials consulted Biden before i...	The stenographer's office supervisor called the release of the altered transcript 'a breach of protocol and spoliation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices.' By Washington Free Beacon After consulting with President Joe Biden, White House press officials altered the official transcript of his Tuesday call in which he referred to former president Donald Trump's supporters as 'garbage,' a move the stenographer's office supervisor labeled a total 'breach of protocol and spoliation of transcript integrity,' the Associated Press reported. According to the original transcript from the White House stenographer’s office, Biden said, 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters—his—his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.' The transcript released by the White House press office, however, added an apostrophe, changing 'supporters' to 'supporter’s.' The press office 'conferred with the president' before making the edit, according to an internal email from the head of the stenographer's office obtained by the Associated Press. The stenographer's office supervisor called the release of the altered transcript 'a breach of protocol and spoliation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices.' 'If there is a difference in interpretation, the Press Office may choose to withhold the transcript but cannot edit it independently,' the supervisor wrote in the internal email, adding, 'Our Stenography Office transcript—released to our [distribution], which includes the National Archives—is now different than the version edited and released to the public by Press Office staff.' Biden’s 'garbage' remark sparked a firestorm of criticism from both sides of the aisle, prompting the press office to request the stenographers quickly produce a transcript of the call, according to the email.

Trump speaks in battleground Pennsylvania, Harris makes Michigan ...	Harris would need to win about 45 electoral votes in the seven swing states to win the White House, while Trump would need about 51. By Reuters and The Algemeiner Republican Donald Trump made a last pitch for support in Pennsylvania, the largest of the seven states expected to decide this week’s US presidential election, while Democratic rival Kamala Harris focused her energy on Michigan on Sunday. Opinion polls show the pair locked in a tight race, with Vice President Harris, 60, bolstered by strong support among women voters while former President Trump, 78, gains ground with Hispanic voters, particularly men. Voters overall view both candidates unfavorably, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, but that so far has not dissuaded them from casting ballots. More than 76 million Americans have already done so ahead of Tuesday’s Election Day, according to the University of Florida’s Election Lab, approaching half the total 160 million votes cast in 2020, which saw the highest US voter turnout in more than a century. North Carolina, another swing state, reported setting a record when its early-vote period ended on Saturday. Control of the US Congress is also up for grabs on Tuesday, with Republicans favored to capture a majority in the Senate while Democrats are seen as having an even chance of flipping Republicans’ narrow majority in the House of Representatives. Presidents whose parties have not controlled both chambers have struggled to pass major new legislation over the past decade. 'Here’s all you need to know: Kamala broke it and we’re going to fix it,' said Trump, beginning his rally in Lititz, in central Pennsylvania, an hour late and his voice raspy. In a speech where he repeatedly criticized the US election process, he added, 'It’s a damn shame and I’m the only one who talks about it because everyone is damn afraid to talk about it.' Trump is later due to speak in Kinston, North Carolina, before ending his day with an evening rally in Macon, Georgia. Those two states are the second-biggest prizes up for grabs on Tuesday, with each holding 16 of the 270 votes a candidate needs to win in the state-by-state Electoral College to secure the presidency. Pennsylvania offers 19 electors. Nonpartisan US election analysts reckon Harris would need to win about 45 electoral votes in the seven swing states to win the White House, while Trump would need about 51, when accounting for the states they are forecast to win easily. HARRIS IN MICHIGAN PUSH Harris is due to speak at a church in Detroit, the largest majority-Black US city, at around noon ET (1700 GMT) on Sunday before heading to East Lansing, a college town in an industrial state that is viewed as a must-win for the Democrat. She faces skepticism from some of the state’s 200,000 Arab Americans who are frustrated Harris has not done more to help end the war in Gaza and scale back aid to Israel. Trump visited Dearborn, the heart of the Arab American community, on Friday and vowed to end the wars in the Middle East. Harris, who has met behind closed doors with selected Arab American and Muslim leaders, will focus her energy on Black neighborhoods on Sunday. Samah Noureddine, 44, a Lebanese American from Grosse Ile, a town near Detroit, said she voted for Biden in 2020 but was casting a ballot for Jill Stein of the Green Party this year. 'I’m upset because Harris is funding the genocide and if we get Trump we’re going to suffer too,' she said. 'I’m sick of both of them.' COST OF LIVING In the campaign’s final days, Harris has sought to convince voters that she will bring down the cost of living, a top concern after several years of high inflation. She has also portrayed Trump as dangerous and erratic and urged Americans to move on from his divisive approach to politics. 'We have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We’re done with that,' she said in Charlotte on Saturday. Trump has argued that Harris, as the sitting vice president, should be held responsible for rising prices and the high levels of immigration of the past several years, which he has portrayed as an existential threat to the country. The stakes are high, with Harris and Trump having starkly different views of the economy, the role of government in American life and the role of the US in the world. One illustration of that came from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump supporter and opponent of military aid to Ukraine as it fights off a Russian invasion. Orban said Europe will need to rethink its support of Ukraine if Trump wins. Trump’s public comments have suggested he could seek to wind down US aid for Ukraine if he wins on Tuesday.

Israeli antibody treatment targets most aggressive breast cancer	Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women around the world, after lung cancer. By JNS A newly developed antibody-based treatment for the most aggressive type of breast cancer could also be used to treat many other cancers, the Weizmann Institute of Science announced on Sunday. The researchers at the university in the central Israeli city of Rehovot, which offers postgraduate-only degrees in the natural and exact sciences, discovered that aggressive breast cancer prompts nearby immune cells to build 'molecular bridges' between themselves, which causes these cells to refrain from attacking the cancer and leads to suppression of the immune response. An antibody treatment that blocks the building of these bridges was shown in a mouse model at the university’s laboratories to restore the immune system’s ability to attack with force, inhibiting the cancer’s progression, the university said. In the past, cancer treatment focused on destroying the malignant cells, using radiation treatment or chemotherapy. In recent decades, however, it has become evident that a tumor’s development depends on the communication between the cancer and the nearby noncancerous cells. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which the study focused on, is the most aggressive type of breast cancer and represents up to 20% of all new cases, the university said. A significant proportion of these cancers occurs in patients with mutations in two genes, which are especially common among Ashkenazi Jews. The City of Hope cancer treatment and research center in Duarte, Calif., in Los Angeles County, is working with the Weizmann Institute to develop therapies based on the antibody, the university said. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women around the world, after lung cancer. While steadily on the decline over the last several decades, the chances are that one in 39 women, or 2.5%, will succumb to the disease. TNBC accounts for 15% to 20% of breast cancer cases. They lack or show low levels of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression and/or gene amplification. The study is being published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Cell Reports.

Iran planning to attack Israel with ‘more powerful’ weapons: Repo...	Iran planning for 'more aggressive targeting' of Israeli military sites, in 'strong and complex' attack. By World Israel News Staff Iran is gearing up for a large-scale attack on Israel that will involve more powerful weaponry which wasn't used in the two previous strikes by Tehran on the Jewish State, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Last month, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on Israel, damaging military sites and sending millions of Israelis into bomb shelters. The only casualty of the attack was a Palestinian man who was killed by shrapnel in Jericho. Some three weeks later, Israel responded with a counter-strike which was said to have destroyed much of Iran's air defense systems and crippled numerous drone and missile manufacturing sites. Although Iran initially signaled that it would not respond to the Israeli strike, because it had not targeted the country's nuclear facilities or oil assets, Tehran has recently changed its rhetoric and is now insisting that it will retaliate. Four Iranian soldiers and a security guard were killed in the Israeli attack. 'Our military lost people, so they need to respond,' an Iranian official, speaking anonymously, told the Journal. The source said that Tehran is planning to use more powerful warheads and weapons in its next attack on the Jewish State. He confirmed previous reports that Iran is planning to use Iraqi territory for at least part of the operation, but added that Iran would be increasing the intensity of the attack. The upcoming attack will likely target Israeli military sites, 'but much more aggressively than last time.' An Egyptian official told the Journal that Iran warned the country to expect a 'strong and complex' attack on Israel. Despite the threats, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian hinted that an end to the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza would lead Iran to scale back its attack. 'If [the Israelis] reconsider their behavior, accept a ceasefire and stop massacring the oppressed and innocent people of the region, it could affect the intensity and type of our response,' Pezeshkian said in a statement carried by state-controlled news outlet IRNA.

In text message, Iran offers Israeli $15,000 for intel: Report	How did they know my name, my parents' names, and phone number?' asked the Israeli woman. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli residing in the central district received a disturbing SMS (text message) allegedly sent by Iranian agents, which included personal information about the recipient and offered her $15,000 to spy on behalf of the Islamic Republic. Speaking to Hebrew-language outlet Mako, the woman - identified only be her first initial, A - recently received a message which began by stating her name, parents' names, and her birthday. 'The Axis of Resistance [a name for Iran and its proxy groups in the region] are looking for [those willing to share] intelligence. Living expenses in the country of your choice and a $15,000 monthly salary. Reach out to us.' 'I don't understand how they got my phone number. How did they know my name and the name of my parents?' asked A, who remains unsettled by the message. 'I immediately blocked the sender and filed a complaint with the police,' she said. According to Mako, Iran likely obtained the woman's personal information in one of several recent hacks of Israeli databases by cyber-criminals from the Islamic Republic. In recent weeks, the Shin Bet announced that dozens of Israelis - nearly all recruited over the social media platform Telegram - had knowingly spied for Iran in exchange for payment. Most of those involved were born in former Soviet bloc countries, though a number were also Israel-born. A senior police official said that news about Iranian spy rings in Israel had raised public awareness about the issue. 'There are a large number of phone calls from citizens reporting that they have received offers from Iran to spy,' a senior police official told Mako. Israelis 'understand the seriousness of the matter, are not tempted to cooperate, block the senders, and report the messages to police in real time. This is incredibly important, helping us identify agents or find those they've already managed to recruit.'

Netanyahu aide suspected of leaking classified information to sab...	Judge Menachem Mizrachi: 'At issue is the endangering of sensitive information &#8230; as well as hampering achieving the goals of the war in the Gaza Strip.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Eli Feldstein, A close aide of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is suspected of allegedly leaking high-security documents to undermine a hostage deal, court records reveal. Feldstein was formerly a spokesperson for the chief officer of Otzma Yehudit, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. The breach is considered one of the most severe in Israel's history after Rishon Lezion Magistrate's Court Judge Menahem Mizrahi partially lifted the gag order on the details of the case. Four individuals, including Feldstein, are being investigated in the matter. Feldstein is being remanded into custody on the charge of illegally accessing IDF documents and leaking them to the press. 'The investigation began after significant suspicions arose in the Shin Bet [Israel Security Agency] and IDF, also in light of media publications indicating that classified and sensitive intelligence information was taken from IDF systems and illegally removed,' the judge wrote. 'At issue is the endangering of sensitive information and information sources, as well as hampering achieving the goals of the war in the Gaza Strip,' Judge Mizrachi continued. The leak occurred during a period of intense pressure to accept a hostage deal following the execution of six captives in Gaza. The leak was the basis of an article, which was later retracted, in the UK-based Jewish Chronicle claiming that Hamas was planning on sending the hostages out of Gaza through Egypt. Based on the leak, the German publication Bild said Hamas was delaying talks as a kind of psychological warfare. The information in the leak seemed designed to support Netanyahu's demands during the hostage release talks and to shield him from criticism over the absence of an agreement. Feldstein began working in the Prime Minister's Office shortly after October 7th, 2023, but he lacked proper credentials after failing a Shin Bet security clearance.

Does Hamas know where the hostages are?	Former Shin Bet Sinwar interrogator: 'Today, no one in all of Hamas knows exactly where all the hostages are being held.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Micha Kobi, a former member of Israel's security agency (Shin Bet) and an interrogator of deceased Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Israeli prison, said he does not believe that the terror group knows the location of all the hostages. He told Maariv, 'The main headquarters of Hamas is no longer operational, but - there are other guerilla fighters who are fighting throughout the region on behalf of the organization, within the framework of local and even neighborhood headquarters of Hamas.' He added, 'Today, no one in all of Hamas knows exactly where all the hostages are being held.' Kobi continued, 'Someone may be aware of the location of one or two, but I don't think anyone is aware of all of them.' He said that Hamas is not interested in a hostage deal and is using false offers of proposals to release captives as a way to blackmail Israel. 'There is no such thing as a deal - this is blackmail. They are mercilessly blackmailing the state,' he said. When Sinwar was killed last month during an IDF operation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered Gazans immunity from prosecution if they return hostages. Kobi recommended the government go a step further and pay a monetary reward for releasing captives. He said, 'We need to go in the direction of intelligence operations and turn to families who know something so that they bring information about the hostages in exchange for money.' Another obstacle is Hamas's control of humanitarian aid in Gaza, which allows the terror group to exert absolute power over the citizens. Video footage and witnesses have proven that Hamas has been looting and stealing aid and selling it back to civilians at exorbitant prices. As a solution, Kobi envisions setting up a military government in Gaza. 'We need to establish units on behalf of the IDF and Shin Bet, which will take care of the local administration, and appoint Gazan education and health personnel - who are not affiliated with Hamas,' he said.' Although the IDF has destroyed 90% of Hamas leaders, 'We need to make sure nothing else remains' of the terror group in the region, which could take 'one or two years.'

Abbas’ advisor demands Hamas free all hostages to save Gaza	It must be stressed that Al-Habbash has never criticized Hamas over the Oct. 7 massacre itself, just their current handling of the war. By Nan Jacques Zilberdik, PWM Referring to Palestinian casualties in the Gaza war as 'a strategic loss to the Palestinian people and the Palestinian cause,' PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas' Advisor Mahmoud Al-Habbash openly expressed his support for freeing all Israeli hostages 'to preserve what remains of the Gaza Strip': Posted text: 'Regarding the ongoing Israeli aggression in the Gaza Strip, [Mahmoud Abbas' Advisor Mahmoud] Al-Habbash emphasized that if it were up to him, he would return the Israeli captives (i.e., hostages) in order to preserve what remains of the Gaza Strip and defend the Palestinian blood that has been spilled by the occupying authority in the Gaza Strip, which according to him constitutes a strategic loss to the Palestinian people and the Palestinian cause.' [PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas' Advisor on Religious Affairs and Islamic Relations Mahmoud Al-Habbash, Facebook page, Oct. 22, 2024] Palestinian Media Watch has reported that Al-Habbash has been vocal in the PA's support for Hamas, repeatedly calling on them to join the PLO. On the other hand, Al-Habbash has just as many times criticized Hamas for bringing destruction on the Palestinian people in Gaza and for serving Iran's interests rather than those of their own people: PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas' Advisor on Religious Affairs and Islamic Relations Mahmoud Al-Habbash: What happened (i.e., Hamas' massacre and launch of terror war) was supposed to be an incentive and opportunity to rearrange the internal Palestinian cards, and not to use Palestinian blood for interests-' Al-Hadath TV host: 'Why did this not happen? Mahmoud Al-Habbash: 'Regional interests. Regional commitments. Unfortunately, there are those (i.e., Iran) who are attempting to use Palestinian blood for their own benefit and not for the benefit of Palestine… Every state seeks its interests. Every party seeks its interests. Israel is seeking its interests, and Iran is seeking its interests.' [PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas' Advisor on Religious Affairs and Islamic Relations Mahmoud Al-Habbash, Facebook page, Oct. 8, 2024] While his recent statement favoring the release of all Israeli hostages is yet another expression of the PA's disapproval of Hamas' handling of the war, it must be stressed that Al-Habbash has never criticized Hamas over the Oct. 7 massacre itself, which the PA has packaged as the Palestinian right to 'self-defense'. Al-Habbash and other PA officials only criticize Hamas for the destruction they continue to bring on the Gaza Strip.

Iran ramps up efforts to disrupt US presidential elections	The State Department continues to offer a $10 million reward for information about the cyber group’s malicious activities. By Jewish Breaking News A cyber group with direct links to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has launched a coordinated campaign targeting swing states ahead of the upcoming US presidential election. A joint report by cybersecurity researcher Nariman Gharib and whistleblower group Lab Dookhtegan shows that 'Emennet Pasargad,'a cyber unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), is executing a campaign to 'disrupt the voter registration process, contaminate voting systems, spread rumors, create chaos, and ultimately damage the infrastructure of US elections.' Last month, the Treasury Department expanded its sanctions against Emennet Pasargad, adding seven individuals connected to election interference efforts in both 2020 and the current election cycle. The State Department continues to offer a $10 million reward for information about the cyber group’s malicious activities. A report from Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center warns that Iran may leverage previously established cyber intrusions to conduct influence campaigns in the immediate lead-up to and aftermath of the election. Intelligence gathered since early 2024 shows Iranian hackers making direct contact with US Senate candidates in the leadup to November 5. According to Israel’s National Cyber Directorate, Iranian hacker groups like 'Homeland Justice' have been working in tandem with established Iranian standouts like 'Imperial Kitten' to serve as digital cover for the regime’s notorious Revolutionary Guard Corps. In the United States, their operations have already triggered federal sanctions against Iranian-backed 'activists' and financial proxies for attempting to hack sensitive government facilities. However, nowhere has Iran’s rapidly intensifying cyber aggression been felt more acutely than in Israel itself. Iranian cyber terrorists allegedly attempted to sabotage operations at Ziv Medical Center in Safed at the height of Hamas’ October 7 massacre against Israel.'

Scientists uncover malaria parasite’s crystal secrets, paving way...	By illuminating how the malaria parasite constructs its protective crystals, scientists may soon outsmart the parasite at its own game. By Pesach Benson, TPS An international team of scientists has provided an unprecedented look into the unique crystals formed by the malaria parasite, opening doors to potentially more effective treatments against a disease that continues to claim over half a million lives annually. Malaria is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito, carrying a single-celled parasite from the Plasmodium family. When a mosquito bites a person, the parasite enters the body, travels to the liver and multiplies. Eventually, it invades red blood cells and begins to consume hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein. However, digesting hemoglobin releases a toxic molecule called heme, which threatens the parasite’s survival. To protect itself, the parasite ingeniously converts heme into dark crystals that neutralize its toxicity. While scientists have known about these crystals for over a century, their exact structure and development process have remained elusive — until now. The research team was led by Professors Leslie Lizarowitz and Michael Albaum from the Weizmann Institute of Science, and involved the collaboration of 17 scientists in Israel, the Czech Republic, U.S., Britain and Austria. For Lizarowitz, a pioneer in crystal research, this mission is deeply personal. Born and raised in South Africa, Lizarowitz’s first encounter with malaria came as a child through his father’s stories of African expeditions. His father would often return with vivid tales of the wildlife he encountered. But he also came back bearing the side effects of quinine, an old malaria drug that caused skin rashes and ringing in the ears. Years later, Lizarowitz found a scientific link between his research in crystallography and the malaria parasite, specifically in how the parasite builds crystals that aid its survival inside the human body. Lizarowitz, who had long been fascinated by the symmetry of these malaria crystals, eventually collaborated with Albaum, an expert in advanced imaging, to tackle this mystery. Albaum’s research on the parasite’s unique cell division, where the parasite reproduces in a highly unusual manner within red blood cells, aligned naturally with Lizarowitz’s work. Together, they set out to uncover the structural intricacies of the crystals formed by malaria parasites, aiming to find weak points that could be targeted by drugs. Their study involved the use of cryogenic scanning transmission electron tomography (CSTET), an advanced imaging technology developed at the Weizmann Institute. However, as the team probed deeper, they encountered challenges that their tools couldn’t overcome. To push the boundaries of their research, they sent the crystals to the University of Oxford and the Diamond Light Source, the UK’s national synchrotron facility. By employing electron-based crystallography, the British team produced highly detailed images that allowed for a level of structural analysis previously thought impossible. The study — recently published in the peer-reviewed ACS Central Science journal — revealed that malaria crystals have a unique surface resembling a butcher’s knife. The side that mimics the blade is smooth and sharp, while the handle side appears rough and uneven, a seemingly chaotic arrangement at the atomic level. This irregularity, as the researchers discovered, stems from the way heme molecules pair up during crystal formation. Unlike synthetic crystals produced in laboratories, these natural malaria crystals exhibit a chiral arrangement — a mirror-image symmetry that prevents perfect alignment. Understanding this structrural quirk could be key to developing new drugs that disrupt the crystals’ formation, thus neutralizing the parasite. Most anti-malarial drugs currently work by targeting the parasite’s crystal-building process, yet many have lost their effectiveness as the parasite evolves resistance. The study’s findings suggest that focusing on the biological structure of the natural crystals, rather than synthetic approximations, could yield more durable drug designs. This approach would consider the precise molecular interactions between the crystals and potential drugs, improving the likelihood of effective treatment. And so the 'international star team' of researchers, as Albaum described it, brought together experts in crystallography, advanced imaging, and molecular biology to achieve a sophisticated 3D model of the malaria crystal structure at an atomic level. Malaria remains a global health challenge, with the World Health Organization reporting approximately 250 million cases and 600,000 deaths in 2022. By illuminating how the malaria parasite constructs its protective crystals, scientists may soon outsmart the parasite at its own game. The findings could also influence research on other diseases where pathogens use crystal defense mechanisms.

UK’s Conservative Party elections new pro-Israel opposition leade...	Israeli Foreign Minister congratulates MP Kemi Badenoch for her victory in the Conservative leadership election, lauding her as a 'true friend of Israel.' By World Israel News Staff Britain's Conservative Party on Saturday elected its new leader, voting in a former cabinet minister from the government's of Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak to replace Sunak, after he stepped down following the landslide Labour victory in July's general election. In an internal party vote Saturday, MP Kemi Badenoch of North West Essex was elected leader of the Conservative Party, and by extension, Leader of the Opposition, defeating rival Robert Jenrick with 57% of the vote, or 53,806 ballots to Jenrick's 41,388. Prior to her election as leader of the Conservative Party, Badenoch held a number of senior government positions in the Sunak and Truss governments, including Secretary of State for Business and Trade, Minister for Women and Equalities, and Secretary of State for International Trade. Badenoch, a long-time supporter of Israel and backer of the war against Hamas, has criticized the Labour government's handling of Britain's relationship with Israel, warning Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government is 'reversing' the country's ties with the Jewish state. In a letter to the Conservative Friends of Israel last month, Badenoch lamented the rise of antisemitism in Britain after October 7th, and vowed to strengthen the UK's ties with Israel. 'If I am leader of the Conservative Party, we will continue to strengthen our ties with Israel and root out the tragic resurgence of antisemitism in the UK. We will be true to our values.' Badenoch publicly praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an interview last month with Sky News, 'congratulating Prime Minister Netanyahu' for confronting the 'enemies of the West.' On the anniversary of the October 7th, Badenoch offered support for Israel's ongoing conflicts against Hamas and Hezbollah, and called on the British government to back both Israel and the local Jewish community. 'A year on from October 7 and Israel is fighting terrorism on multiple fronts. A year on from October 7 we need to show moral clarity, stand with our ally and recognise our enemy. We must never forget what happened….' 'We have also seen great courage and unity in the face of hatred and in the midst of grief. It is important that our government continues to stand strong with Israel and support the Jewish community in Britain.' Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz praised Badenoch in a tweet shortly after her victory was announced Saturday. 'Warm congratulations to Kemi Badenoch on becoming the new leader of the Conservatives party in the UK. Kemi Badenoch, you are a true friend of Israel, and I congratulate you for breaking yet another glass ceiling.'

Israel threatens to strike Iraq over Iranian attacks – report	Israel quietly preparing for air operations against Iranian proxies in Iraq, as well as Iraqi state targets. By World Israel News Staff Israel has warned Iraq it could strike targets in the country if anti-Israel Iranian proxy forces are allowed to continue to operate, according to a report over the weekend by the UK-based Arabic news outlet Elaph. Pro-Iranian militia groups in Iraq have launched multiple drone attacks on Israel, and are reportedly receiving Iranian ballistic missiles and other weaponry from Tehran. Israel has reportedly identified targets in Iraq to strike if the attacks on its territory by pro-Iranian Iraqi militias continue, with Israeli officials said to have warned Baghdad, urging it to control the militias operating within its borders and prevent them from using Iraq as a base for operations against Israel. According to the report, Israel has warned Iraq that it may strike not only pro-Iranian proxy forces but also Iraqi state targets, should Iran-backed militias be allowed to continue to operate in the country. Unnamed sources cited in the report indicate that Israeli satellites have detected movements by Iranian forces in Iraq, along with the transfer of ballistic missiles and related equipment from Iran into Iraqi territory. This is thought to be part of a plan to use Iraq as a staging ground for an expected attack on Israel. Israeli surveillance has been focused on identifying positions of these Iran-aligned militias and select Iraqi state sites, highlighting a potential escalation if Iraq fails to curb these activities. Iran has directly attacked Israel twice this year, including an attack on April 13th which included drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles, and the massive October 1st ballistic missile attack during which nearly 200 missiles were launched. Israel retaliated following each attack, including airstrikes on October 26th which involved over 100 Israeli fighter jets bombing Iran's missile defense network.

US can’t stop Israel from major retaliation if Iran attacks, Bide...	Biden administration warns Iran not to strike Israel again, saying US cannot prevent Israel from a larger retaliatory attack if Tehran launches a third attack on the Jewish state. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff Following a pair of Iranian ballistic missile attacks on Israel earlier this year, the Biden administration has warned Tehran that the United States will not be able to curb Israel's retaliation should Iran attack Israel directly for a third time, Axios reported Saturday night. According to a U.S. official and a former Israeli official cited by the Axios report, the Biden White House has urged Iran not to undertake another strike on Israel, following the April 13th combination drone and missile attack, and the October 1st ballistic missile attack. While the U.S. pressured Israel to restrain its response after both attacks, the White House warned Iran that it would be unable to curb Israel's retaliation after a third attack. 'We told the Iranians: We won't be able to hold Israel back, and we won't be able to make sure that the next attack will be calibrated and targeted as the previous one,' the American official told Axios. According to the source, the Biden administration conveyed the message directly to Iran, an unusual step for the U.S., which typically communicates with Iran via intermediaries. The Israeli official cited in the report said, however, that a message was transmitted from the U.S. to Iran via Switzerland. The Biden administration declined to comment on the Axios report. Over the weekend, the U.S. deployed B-52 Stratofortress bombers to the Middle East, and bolstered its naval presence in the region, as Iran threatened a 'crushing response' against Israel over its October 26th retaliatory strikes on Iran, carried out in response to the October 1st ballistic missile attacks.

Half of Israeli hostages in Gaza are already dead – report	Israeli intelligence now suggests that half of the remaining captives in Gaza are already dead. By World Israel News Staff Approximately half of the remaining Israeli hostages held captive by terrorists in the Gaza Strip have already died, according to an estimate drafted by Israeli intelligence services. On Sunday, Israel Hayom reported that during a closed-door session of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed information collected by Israel's intelligence community which indicated that just 51 of the 101 captives being held in the Gaza Strip are still alive. Officially, Israel has gone on record confirming the deaths of 37 of the 101 remaining hostages, whose bodies remain held in captivity in the Gaza Strip. However, 13 others are strongly suspected to have died at some point since October 7th, though their deaths have not been confirmed beyond a doubt. Israeli intelligence agencies maintain an updated database of information on the hostages, including clues regarding their condition and location. Jerusalem uses the information regarding the status of the captives not only in order to help shape negotiations with Hamas, but also to plan possible rescue operations and to delineate potential sites where airstrikes should be avoided. The Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee deliberations in September also revealed information regarding how those captives who have already died are believed to have met their fate. Twenty-seven are believed to have been murdered by Hamas terrorists while being held captive, while at least seven others were killed inadvertently by Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip. While the intelligence report delivered by Netanyahu to the Knesset committee in September suggested 51 hostages are likely alive, some security officials are pessimistic, believing that due to the harsh conditions the captives had endured for over a year since October 7th, more than 50 of the remaining captives are dead.

Inside Israel’s daring capture of a Hezbollah naval officer	The raid deep in Lebanon took only four minutes, and a street camera was erased remotely to protect the soldiers. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News New details are emerging from the Lebanese press regarding Israel’s daring raid Friday to capture a Hezbollah naval captain from deep inside the land of the cedars. Al-Jadid reported Saturday that 20 members of the Israeli naval commandos, Shayetet 13, took only four minutes to get into the apartment of Imad Amhaz in the coastal town of Batroun, grab him and leave. Two of the men were reported as being 'civilians,' probably meaning that they were dressed in ordinary clothes. In the video from a street camera that has gone viral, an armed group can be seen with some of them holding onto a prisoner, ostensibly Amhaz, with a shirt covering his face. Al Jadid also claimed that a public security camera had some of its footage 'erased remotely' in an attempt by the IDF to prevent unwanted information about the soldiers to be revealed. Lebanese security has confiscated the street cameras that could help them figure out what exactly occurred. Ten SIM cards, a phone and several foreign passports, all with his photo, were found in the apartment where Amhaz was staying, the report added. No mention was made of any German peacekeepers from UNIFIL aiding the group, as previously reported. A UNIFIL spokesperson denied that soldiers from the peacekeeping force had anything to do with the operation. Hezbollah gave a bare-bones acknowledgement of the raid by saying that there had been a 'Zionist aggression in the Batroun area.' Lebanese officials have put out contradictory reports on Amhaz, with some saying that he was a captain in the Lebanese navy, and others, such as Minister of Transportation Ali Hamie, maintaining that he was a civilian ship captain who was in Batroun for training purposes. In announcing his capture, the IDF called Amhaz a 'maritime expert' who was transferred to Israel for interrogation by military intelligence’s Unit 504. 'We will act in all ways in the war with Hezbollah and use all possible fighting methods to hit the organization and produce quality intelligence for us on the enemy,' the army said. 'We will act wherever we can succeed in capturing significant operatives, as has also happened in South Lebanon.' AP cited three Lebanese 'judicial officials' who said an investigation had begun in order to find out if Amhaz was indeed linked to the Shiite terror organization that has launched nearly 10,000 rockets, missiles, UAVs and anti-tank grenades at Israel to support Hamas over the past 13 months as the IDF fights to destroy it in the Gaza Strip. They also threw out the hypothesis that Amhaz was an Israeli spy who required a rescue for unknown reasons. Neighbors in the apartment building told the news agency that when the men broke into Amhaz’s apartment, they announced themselves as being from state security.

US to deploy B-52s, warships to Middle East as Iran threatens ‘cr...	Throughout the escalation, American military installations from Syria to Iraq have weathered persistent attacks from Iranian-backed militias. By Jewish Breaking News The United States is beefing up its deterrent forces in the Middle East as Iran continues to threaten Israel, announcing plans on Saturday to deploy B-52 bombers, fighter jets, refueling aircraft and Navy destroyers to the region. 'Should Iran, its partners, or their proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people,' Pentagon spokesperson Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder stated. Israel faces an escalating series of military confrontations across the region. Beyond direct missile exchanges with Iran, Israeli forces are actively engaging Tehran’s proxy networks on multiple fronts. While Hamas maintains entrenched positions throughout Gaza, Hezbollah forces continue to threaten Israel’s northern border, and Houthi militants launch regular attacks from Yemen. Throughout the escalation, American military installations from Syria to Iraq have weathered persistent attacks from Iranian-backed militias, even as U.S. warships intercept Houthi drone attacks in the Red Sea shipping lanes. Meanwhile, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei issued new threats against Israel on Saturday, warning of a 'crushing response.' 'The enemies, whether it be the Zionist regime or the United States will certainly receive a crushing response for what they do against Iran and the Resistance Front,'Khamenei declared. 'We are fully committed to preparing the Iranian nation in every necessary way to confront arrogance. Whether in terms of military readiness, weaponry, or political efforts, thank God, officials are actively engaged in these efforts.' 'This is not merely about revenge; it is a logical movement, a confrontation aligned with religion, ethics, Sharia, and international laws,' he said. 'The Iranian people and the country’s officials will not show any hesitation or leniency in this regard. Be assured of this.' However, Iran’s ability to make good on its threats against Israel may have been significantly compromised, with U.S. and Israeli officials revealing to the Wall Street Journal that Israeli strikes inflicted heavy damage on Tehran’s air defenses and missile manufacturing sites.

Argentina’s Javier Milei selects Jewish ambassador to replace for...	Werthein will lead a 'transformation in our country’s foreign policy,' according to a statement from Milei’s office. By Juan Melamed, JTA A Jewish veterinarian from an influential business dynasty has been named Argentina’s foreign minister at a time when President Javier Milei has prioritized ties with the United States and Israel. Gerardo Werthein replaced Diana Mondino, whom Milei fired after Argentina voted in the United Nations to condemn the U.S. embargo on Cuba. The United States and Israel — which Milei, elected last year, has defined as Argentina’s main allies, in a shift for Argentina — were the only two votes opposing the non-binding resolution. Werthein had been Milei’s ambassador to the United States, one of two Jewish ambassadors that the self-described 'anarcho-capitalist' has appointed. The other is Axel Wahnish, an Orthodox rabbi who represents Argentina in Israel. Werthein will lead a 'transformation in our country’s foreign policy,' according to a statement from Milei’s office. A main component of that transformation has been Argentina’s relationship to Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Milei’s predecessor was a sharp critic of Israel, as are his counterparts across Latin America. The leaders of neighboring Brazil and Chile have condemned Israel for its military response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, as has Colombia’s Gustavo Petro. Milei, in contrast, has offered full-throated support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, and visited Israel in February on his first international trip as president. The realignment has included defining Hamas as a terrorist group for the first time, as well as formally naming the terror group Hezbollah as culpable for two deadly attacks on Jewish targets in Buenos Aires in the 1990s. Last week, Security Minister Patricia Bullrich disclosed the identity of the Hezbollah chief in Latin America, Hussein Ahmad Karaki. She said he participated in the terrorist attacks in Buenos Aires and continues to lead Hezbollah’s operations in the region, likely from Lebanon. She said she would seek his prosecution. Werthein, whose only direct diplomatic experience includes his short stint as ambassador, is expected to draw on his years in international sports collaboration and his role in the family business. That business started in 1904 when an ancestor, an immigrant from Bessarabia in what was then Russia, founded a country store in the agricultural La Pampa province called 'The Hebrew.' Today, the Werthein Group has interests in agriculture and livestock, retail, telecommunications, real estate, financial services, wineries and energy. Gerardo Werthein left the company in 2019. Werthein has competed as an equestrian and was president of the Argentine Olympic Committee from 2009 to 2021, during which Buenos Aires was chosen to host the 2018 Youth Olympic Games. He is also a member of the International Olympic Committee and the Olympic Broadcasting Services. He traveled to New York with Milei a year ago to visit the gravesite of the Lubavitcher Rebbe in Queens, one of several demonstrations of Jewish affinity that the Catholic-born Milei, an avowed philosemite, made before and after his election. 'It was a special, symbolic and pretty moment,' he said about his visit to the gravesite at the time. The U.S. ambassador to Argentina, Marc Stanley, is also Jewish and active in the local Jewish community in Buenos Aires.

Rockets from Lebanon wound 11 in Israel	Around the time the rockets hit, Hezbollah said it had targeted a military base on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. By Reuters and The Algemeiner Rockets fired from Lebanon wounded 11 people in central Israel on Saturday, Israeli emergency services said, after one of them hit a house, as prospects for a ceasefire dimmed. Fighting has escalated between Israeli forces and the Lebanese Hezbollah terrorist group since September, and hopes that a US push this week for a ceasefire have faded. 'We went out and saw dust, children screaming, women screaming and everyone went to the house that was struck,' said Qasim Mohab, a resident of Tira, where the rocket hit. 'We were able to evacuate and rescue those who were inside the house, and thank God we were blessed that there was no one killed.' Around the time the rockets hit, Hezbollah said it had targeted a military base on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Israel’s ambulance service said that 11 people were hurt by shrapnel. Air raid sirens continued to sound in northern Israel as rocket fire and drone attacks from Lebanon continued, the military said. On Friday, Lebanon’s health ministry said 52 people were killed in Israeli strikes on more than a dozen towns in the Baalbek region, which has UNESCO-listed Roman ruins. The Israeli military said on Saturday it had killed two Hezbollah commanders in the area of Tyre on Friday. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah. Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas a day after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza.

Biden Administration threatens to cut off military aid to Israel ...	Israel's Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer is expected to respond to the letter on Tuesday, following the US elections. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Biden Administration has issued an ultimatum to Israel that if the humanitarian situation in Gaza doesn't improve by November 13th, it will cut military aid. The warning follows a letter by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to their Israeli counterparts on October 13th. The letter stated that if there were no amelioration of the condition of Gazan civilians in 30 days, there would likely be limitations on the delivery of weapons and supplies to Israel. The US issues these warnings despite evidence that over half of the humanitarian aid Israel delivers to Gaza is stolen by Hamas terrorists, and the looting of supplies weakens Gazan civilians and strengthens Hamas. In a press conference on Thursday, Blinken and Austin said, 'Both of us and our teams are tracking very carefully Israel's responsibilities to meet the letter of the law &#8230; with regard to the provision of humanitarian assistance. ' They acknowledged that there had been some improvement but expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of progress. Channel 12 reported that as of September 2024, Hamas profited half a billion dollars from humanitarian aid deliveries in Gaza. Gazan civilians report and footage shows Hamas stealing aid from convoys coming into Gaza and often selling it to civilians at high prices. In the report, journalist Almog Boker described the stolen humanitarian aid as 'oxygen' for the terror group. Israel's Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer is expected to respond to the letter on Tuesday, following the US elections. On Friday, the US State Department reported that during a meeting between Blinken and Dermer, the Secretary of State emphasized ending the war in Gaza, bringing the hostages home, and establishing a policy for governance of Gaza following a ceasefire. They also discussed implementing a diplomatic agreement to end the conflict in Lebanon for the safe return of the Israeli evacuees to their homes in the north.

Israeli Navy commando unit captures top Hezbollah official	Imad Amhaz is reported to be a 'considerable source of knowledge' about Hezbollah's navy. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a raid on Friday night, Israeli Navy’s Shayetet 13 commando unit captured a top Hezbollah official in northern Lebanon, Israel's military confirms. Imad Amhaz is reported to be a 'considerable source of knowledge' about Hezbollah's navy. The raid was conducted by sea as the commandos arrived at a chalet on the coast of Batroun, south of Tripoli. The operation was accomplished in cooperation with German naval forces working as part of UNIFIL. The Military Intelligence Directorate's Unit 504, whose focus is HUMINT, or human intelligence, is questioning Amhaz. More than 25 people took part in the raid of the cabin where Amhaz was staying alone. The operation to capture Amhaz follows a deadly Hezbollah rocket attack on Thursday that killed seven people and seriously injured one. Two Hezbollah missiles landed in an open area outside the Upper Galilee city of Metula, according to the Israel Defense Forces. One Israeli farmer was killed along with four foreign workers, and there was another worker who was seriously injured. Another Hezbollah attack the same day killed two people in a field off Route 79 near the Haifa suburb of Kiryat Ata. 'Paramedics provided medical treatment and CPR, following which a 30-year-old man and a 60-year-old woman were pronounced dead, and a 71-year-old man was evacuated to Rambam Hospital due to minor shrapnel wounds,' the emergency service said in a statement. An initial draft of a US ceasefire proposal calls for Hezbollah to comply with a previous agreement to retreat from Lebanon's border with Israel and for the IDF to withdraw from Lebanon within a week, as reported by Kan news. The proposal, presented by top US security official Amos Hochstein, outlines an initial 60-day truce followed by a permanent ceasefire. One requirement is the enforcement of UN Resolution 1701, adopted at the end of the Second Lebanon War in 2006, which called for 'the establishment between the Blue Line and the Litani river of an area free of any armed personnel, assets, and weapons other than those of the Government of Lebanon.'

Netanyahu said, 'The main issue is &#8230; Israel's ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As progress continues on the Lebanon ceasefire proposal, Israel has requested a commitment from the US that it has the freedom to respond if Hezbollah violates provisions, Reuters reports. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to US envoys and insisted on Israel's continued ability to deal with threats from Hezbollah and guarantees for security on the northern border so 40,000 Israeli evacuees can return to their homes. Netanyahu spoke to the envoys shortly after a deadly Hezbollah attack that killed five people in Metula, with another two killed by shrapnel in Kiryat Ata. Netanyahu said, 'The main issue is &#8230; Israel's ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon.' The envoys, Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein were in Israel with the hope of securing a ceasefire to end the conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza. In addition to meeting with Netanyahu, the envoys also discussed the proposal with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Shin Bet director Ronan Bar, Mossad director David Barnea, and other senior Israeli officials.

The enforcement of Resolution 1701 would create a buffer zone free from Hezbollah and would potentially allow the safe return to their homes of over 40,000 displaced Israelis. The current ceasefire proposal stipulates that only the Lebanese army, besides UNIFIL, would be the only armed group in Southern Lebanon.

Freed hostage celebrates bar mitzvah	Erez Calderon, along with his sister Sahar (16), was released in the hostage for prisoner exchange last November. By JBN and World Israel News Staff Former hostage Erez Calderon from Kibbutz Nir Oz celebrated his bar mitzvah today, surrounded by family, friends, and community members who came together to honor this important milestone. However, it was a bittersweet ceremony as one person was deeply missed—Erez's father, Ofer Calderon, 54, who remains held in Gaza. The celebration was filled with both joy and longing as prayers continued for Ofer's safe return. Erez Calderon, along with his sister Sahar (16), was released in the hostage for prisoner exchange last November. Erez's grandmother Carmela Dan and his cousin Noya Dan were both murdered on October 7th. In September, Erez Calderon released a video on Instagram with a heartfelt appeal for his father's return from Gaza. In the video, he mentions his future bar mitzvah and wonders how he will be able to celebrate while his father is still kept captive. He said, 'How can I celebrate… when my father is in Gaza?' 'I have a clear goal in life — that he return,' he said. Calderon also described being taken captive by Hamas. When terrorists attacked his kibbutz, he heard shooting and assumed it was from the IDF. However, the family realized that terrorists were invading their home. 'Then it all started,' Erez Calderon said. At first, the family hid in the bomb shelter, but terrorists captured them as they tried to escape through a window. 'I tried to look for my father, but all I saw were terrorists with weapons and bodies thrown on the floor,' he said. The last time he saw his father, Ofer, he was on his knees, being beaten severely by terrorists. 'Imagine how I felt when I was separated from my father when he was all covered in blood from the blows the terrorists gave him. It's a moment that never leaves me,' he said.

Israel-Vietnam free trade agreement to take effect on Friday	The agreement also eases regulatory barriers across several fields, particularly in services, standardization, and investments. By Pesach Benson, TPS A free-trade agreement between Israel and Vietnam signed in 2023 is due to take effect on Friday as Israel’s Ministry Economy and Industry said it anticipated a boost in bilateral trade. The free trade agreement is Israel’s first with a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a political and economic union made up of 10 countries, including several that do not have diplomatic ties with Israel. 'The trade agreement with Vietnam is a leap forward in the Israeli economy – another step on the way to deepening Israel’s cooperation with leading economies in the world,' said Minister of Economy and Industry Nir Barkat. 'Israel brings innovation and unique technological advantages that will reach the Vietnamese market, and this is a connection that the world cannot ignore. I instructed the Foreign Trade Administration teams to continue to strengthen the network of agreements and open new doors for the Israeli industry and exporters – which will result in a significant contribution to the consumer public in Israel and to lower the cost of living.' The agreement reduces customs tariffs on a wide range of products, ranging from chemicals and electronic equipment to agricultural products and medical devices. The agreement also eases regulatory barriers across several fields, particularly in services, standardization, and investments. Israel also imports significant consumer goods from Vietnam, such as clothing, footwear, coffee, and mobile phones, With a steady increase in trade between Israel and Vietnam — reaching $1.3 billion in 2023 — the Foreign Trade Administration projects even greater growth in 2024, despite supply chain constraints stemming from the war with Hamas and Hezbollah. The anticipated customs reductions and the simplification of trade barriers are expected to inject tens of millions of shekels into the Israeli economy annually. 'This agreement is an expression of our commitment to expand Israeli export options to the world. Southeast Asian markets, and in particular Vietnam, are a reliable, stable and growing destination for Israel, and we will continue to create relative advantages for Israeli industry in these markets,' said Roy Fisher, director of the ministry’s Foreign Trade Administration.

Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke confronts anti-Israel fan from on s...	Radiohead has performed in Israel several times, most recently in 2017, despite facing intense pressure to boycott the Jewish state. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemiener Thom Yorke, lead singer of Radiohead and The Smile, abruptly walked off stage during his solo concert in Melbourne, Australia, on Wednesday night after having a heated exchange with an audience member, who interrupted the show to voice his opposition to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. During a pause between songs at Yorke’s second sold-out show at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, an audience member shouted at him as he stood on stage, as seen in a TikTok video taken during the incident. The audience member claimed, without evidence, that 200,000 people have already been killed in the Gaza Strip, half of them children. He yelled at the British rocker, 'How can you be silent? How many dead children will it take for you to condemn the genocide in Gaza?' as seen in footage obtained by The Age. Yorke responded, 'Hop up on the f—king stage and say what you wanna say. Don’t stand there like a coward, come here and say it. You wanna piss on everybody’s night? OK, you do. See you later, then.' He then took off his guitar and left the stage. Other members of the audience then began booing, shouting at the anti-Israel protester and expressing frustration after Yorke walked off stage. They also chanted for Yorke, and a few minutes later he returned to perform the night’s final song, the Radiohead hit 'Karma Police,' according to The Age. 'Don’t stand there like a coward,come here and say it!' Radiohead’s Thom Yorke responded to an anti-Israel hackler who kept yelling about Gaza throughout his show in Melbourne today. Yorke left the stage and came back after the crowd kicked out the protester. pic.twitter.com/a5yhtBWpTo — Hen Mazzig (@HenMazzig) October 30, 2024 Radiohead has performed in Israel several times, most recently in 2017, despite facing intense pressure to boycott the Jewish state as part of the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement. At the time, Yorke called the harassment from BDS supporters 'extremely upsetting,' 'deeply disrespectful', and 'offensive.' He also took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to defend the band’s decision to play in Israel that year. 'Playing in a country isn’t the same as endorsing its government,' he wrote. 'We’ve played in Israel for over 20 years through a succession of governments, some more liberal than others. As we have in America. We don’t endorse [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu any more than [former US President Donald] Trump, but we still play in America. Music, art ,and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue, and freedom of expression.' This summer, Yorke’s bandmate, Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, was criticized and threatened by BDS supporters for performing with Israeli artist Dudu Tassa and his band in Tel Aviv. Greenwood, who is married to Israeli visual artist Sharona Katan, responded by saying that efforts to boycott Israeli artists 'feels unprogressive.' 'No art is as ‘important’ as stopping all the death and suffering around us. But doing nothing seems a worse option,' he explained. 'And silencing Israeli artists for being born Jewish in Israel doesn’t seem like any way to reach an understanding between the two sides of this apparently endless conflict.'

Amid hostage deal negotiations, Qatar is unsure who is leading Ha...	Although the Qataris are involved in discussions with Hamas officials, it is uncertain who in the terror group has the last word during negotiations. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In the attempt to revive hostage deal negotiations, Qatar is facing the challenge of determining who is the leader of Hamas after the death of Yahya Sinwar, according to Kan. Although the Qataris are involved in discussions with Hamas officials, it is uncertain who in the terror group has the last word during negotiations. On October 18, the death of Sinwar was confirmed and happened not during a planned assassination but when IDF soldiers spotted Sinwar during a regular operation in Gaza. Hamas has yet to replace Sinwar as the leader of the terror group. Al Hadath reported that a senior Hamas official rejected a proposal for a limited hostage release deal, but Hamas' Taher al-Nunu said they would consider a proposal that led directly to a permanent ceasefire. A day after Egypt proposed a 48-hour ceasefire coinciding with the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, Hamas rejected the plan on Monday. At the resumption of negotiations in Qatar on Sunday, Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi proposed an initial two-day ceasefire and hostage-for-prisoner exchange to lead to a more comprehensive deal. The plan would begin with a 48-hour ceasefire, during which four hostages with foreign citizenship would be released in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. During this period, the delivery of humanitarian aid will be facilitated in Gaza. For the duration, the IDF would remain within Gaza but refrain from operating armored vehicles. On news that Egypt had proposed the two-day ceasefire and hostages for the prisoners release plan, a Palestinian source told Reuters on Sunday that Hamas would be unlikely to accept any deal without a full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza and an end to the war from the outset. The Palestinian official told Reuters, 'I expect Hamas would listen to the new offers, but it remains determined that any agreement must end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza.' On Monday, Netanyahu indicated he would be willing to accept the temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal. At a Likud meeting, he said, 'If there were a deal for a two-day ceasefire to release four hostages, I would take it immediately.'

Iran planning ‘painful’ attack on Israel before US election: Repo...	Iranian official warns of imminent attack on Israel that will be 'definitive and painful.' By World Israel News Staff Iran is reportedly gearing up to strike the Jewish State in the near future, despite initially signaling that it would not respond to Israel's recent attack on military and weapons manufacturing sites. According to a CNN report, Iran is expected to attack Israel in the coming days, before the U.S. presidential election on November 5th. Notably, Israel was said to have scaled back its retaliatory strike on Iran - which came after an October 1st attack by Tehran which saw 200 ballistic missiles launched at Israel - due to concerns that a major campaign targeting the Islamic Republic's nuclear and oil sites would influence the outcome of the election. 'The response of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the Zionist regime’s aggression will be definitive and painful,' an Iranian source, who was said to have direct knowledge of the plans, told CNN. According to an Axios report, Iran is planning to leverage its proxy groups in Iraq to launch a large number of ballistic missiles and explosive drones at Israel. Iran is likely launching the attack from Iraqi territory in the hopes of preventing an Israeli response on Iranian soil. Israel warned Iran that any future attacks would see a serious escalation in the response from the Jewish State, which has so far been restricted to military sites. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday that should Iran attack Israel once again, the Israeli air force will target sites that it had previously avoided - likely the country's nuclear development program and oil assets. Biden administration officials warned that Washington would fully back Israel in escalating the conflict, in the event of an additional Iranian attack. 'Iran should not respond to Israel's retaliation. They should not,' said White House spokeswoman Karin Jean-Pierre at a recent media conference. 'If they do, we will support Israel in defending itself, but they should not,' she said at a news briefing. Jean-Pierre's remarks were echoed by State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. 'As we have stated publicly, and Iran clearly knows this, they must not escalate this conflict,' Miller said.

Israeli musician questioned by US police for hostage sign	Israeli singer escorted by LAPD out of the Hollywood Bowl after he refused to lower sign supporting hostages. By World Israel News Staff A prominent Israeli musician said he was detained by Los Angeles police for displaying a sign calling for the release of the hostages still held in the Gaza Strip by the Hamas terror group. One of Israel's most legendary rock singers, Aviv Geffen, was at a concert in Los Angeles on Wednesday evening when the drama began. Geffen was one of thousands of audience members watching a performance at the Hollywood Bowl by David Gilmour, a founding member of Pink Floyd. In a reference to the classic Pink Floyd song Wish You Were Here, Geffen held up a large sign reading 'Wish They Were Here,' which included a yellow ribbon - a symbol which is used in Israel by those advocating to free the hostages. But, Geffen wrote on social media, he was immediately flagged as suspicious by local police for the sign. 'I held up the sign [supporting] the hostages. The police asked me why I was holding it up, and I explained that I'm from Israel and it’s for the hostages,' Geffen wrote on is Instagram account. 'They asked me to put it down, and I refused.' Due to his refusal to lower the sign, he was escorted out of the Hollywood Bowl and detained by officers, who questioned him outside of the venue. The Hollywood Bowl and Los Angeles Police Department declined to comment on the incident to Hebrew-language media outlets. Geffen was once known as a left-wing activist and made numerous statements slamming the settler movement in Gaza and Judea and Samaria, along with often making remakrs that disparaged religious Jewish practice. But in recent years, Geffen has retracted many of his previous stances. In 2022, Geffen performed in the settlement of Beit El alongside Hasidic singer Avraham Fried. During the concert, he apologized for his comments criticizing settlers. 'I spoke out of ignorance and did not understand the other,' he said. 'I have grown up and I want to ask you for forgiveness from the bottom of my heart. I am here out of love.'

Israel’s Interior Ministry cuts ties with Haaretz over owner’s ‘N...	The ministry cannot stay silent 'in the face of harm to IDF soldiers and the state’s efforts to protect its citizens,' said Ministry Director-General Ronen Peretz. By David Isaac, JNS Israel’s Interior Ministry announced on Thursday it will no longer publish in the Hebrew daily Haaretz following anti-Israel comments by Amos Schocken, the paper’s publisher, at a London conference on Oct. 27. Ministry Director-General Ronen Peretz stated the ministry’s new position in a letter to Kobi Altar, director of its Department of Publicity and Advocacy. 'As part of a conference held in London, the publisher of the newspaper Haaretz, Mr. Amos Schocken, said serious things in English, in which he called Palestinian terrorists ‘freedom fighters,'' the letter states. 'In addition, he called for sanctions to be imposed on the Land of Israel and its leaders and claimed that the IDF is carrying out a second Nakba and imposing apartheid rule in Judea, Samaria and Gaza,' it continues. Schocken’s words 'arouse disgust and indicate a severe disconnect from fundamental values, especially at a time when the State of Israel is waging a war that could not be more just, which began as a result of the murderous terrorist attack of the organization Hamas on Oct. 7,' wrote Peretz. As a result, 'until further notice,' all 'publication and collaborations' with Haaretz were to be canceled, he said. The ministry cannot stay silent 'in the face of harm to IDF soldiers and the state’s efforts to protect its citizens,' Peretz concluded. In a similar move, the mayor of Nesher, a town of about 23,000 near Haifa, announced on Thursday that it would also cut ties with the paper, Channel 14 reported. 'I informed the municipal spokesperson and the treasurer to stop any publication in the newspaper Haaretz and any newspaper related to this newspaper,' tweeted Mayor Roi Levy. At the London conference, titled 'Israel After October 7th: Allied or Alone?,' which was sponsored by Haaretz, Schocken opened the event by accusing the Netanyahu government of 'imposing a cruel apartheid regime' on the Palestinian Arab population. 'It dismisses the costs [to] both sides for defending the settlements while fighting the Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls terrorists. In a sense, what is taking place now in the occupied territories and in part of Gaza is a second Nakba,' said Schocken, using the Arab term meaning 'disaster' for Israel’s 1948 War of Independence. 'A Palestinian state must be established, and the only way to achieve this, I think, is to apply sanctions against Israel’s leader, against the leaders who oppose it and against the settlers,' added Schocken. מו'ל 'הארץ', עמוס שוקן, במופע אנטי ישראלי: 'מחבלים פלשתינים הם לוחמי חירות, יש להטיל סנקציות על רוה'מ, סמוטריץ', בן גביר וצה'ל מבצעים נכבה שניה בעזה'#המהדורה_המרכזית@MaggieTabibi @IshayFridman pic.twitter.com/W4XbLq5Kwx &mdash; עכשיו 14 (@Now14Israel) October 30, 2024 Other speakers at the conference also made controversial remarks. Mick Davis, a former Conservative Party chief executive and leader of the Jewish Leadership Council, said, 'Israel’s existential threat is entirely internal and not external,' according to The Guardian. Labour MP Hamish Falconer, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa, defended the United Kingdom withholding arms export licenses to Israel, saying, 'Everything we do is based on international law.' Arab Israeli Knesset member Ayman Odeh, of the Hadash-Taal Party, said the British government must 'end all military, financial and diplomatic support' to the Israeli government, the paper reported. Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert, who participated in a panel discussion at the conference, said the Gaza war should have ended months ago. 'Israel should pull out completely from Gaza' and 'embark immediately on negotiations… for a two state solution,' he said. 'Ironically, given how many of the speakers were critical of the Israeli government’s conduct, conference-goers were met outside the JW3 community centre in north London by a pro-Palestinian demonstration,' The Guardian reported. Other sponsors of the conference included left-wing NGOs, the New Israel Fund, Yachad, A Land for All and Standing Together.

Gift of life: Israeli soldier’s selfless bone marrow donation sav...	The process hurt a bit, but it was worth every moment to help a child. Any temporary pain for me meant saving a life, and that’s all that mattered,' said Matan Amir. By Pesach Benson, TPS A three-year-old boy hospitalized in Jerusalem with blood cancer got a new lease on life thanks to the selflessness of a 21-year-old soldier fighting in Gaza who was identified as a suitable bone marrow donor for the toddler. 'I didn’t have too much to think about. In the end it’s saving a person’s life, and in my case the life of a small child. In moments like this there is no thinking at all,' said Matan Amir, who fights in the army’s Givati Brigade. The operation was done at the Hadassah-Ein Kerem Medical Center in Jerusalem. Amir had registered with Hadassah’s bone marrow registry on the day he first enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces, through an arrangement the army has with the hospital. Like other soldiers, he simply provided a simple saliva sample at his screening and didn’t give the matter a second thought. But months into his service, Amir was identified as a genetic match for a young boy diagnosed with a severe blood disorder and needing a stem cell donation to survive. When Hadassah’s bone marrow transplant coordinator, Tsila Bargil Ben-Hanan, learned that Amir was a match, she faced the unique challenge of reaching him amid limited cell phone access in the combat area. And so began a complex coordination involving Hadassah, the army, and Amir’s commanding officers to connect Amir with the hospital. 'I left Gaza, opened the phone and saw rescue messages from the bone marrow reserve in Hadassah,' Matan recalled. 'I went back to her and we talked, she explained to me what it was about and what process I would have to go through if I decided to donate bone marrow. I immediately agreed and I immediately told her that of course I would do it. I didn’t see it as a difficult or complex story.' With the army’s approval, Amir met with Prof. Reuven Or, an expert in hematology and director of Hadassah bone marrow pool. During the meeting, Or explained the two main methods of bone marrow donation. One involves harvesting stem cells directly from the bloodstream through a process called apheresis, which involves a small injection and blood filtration. The other, less common but more effective in certain cases, requires extracting bone marrow cells from the pelvic bone using a specialized needle. For Amir’s young recipient, the pelvic bone procedure was recommended due to the child’s age and condition. Amir agreed immediately. 'The process hurt a bit,' Amir shared. 'But it was worth every moment to help a child. Any temporary pain for me meant saving a life, and that’s all that mattered.' Said Or, 'Donating bone marrow is, of course, true volunteering, which is highly valued. To me, every donor is a hero, and giving is heroic in the literal sense of the word, both contributing to saving lives in Hadassah and contributing to saving lives in the army.' Amir’s recovery from the donation required a short break from his military duties, particularly refraining from physical activity for a week. Though Amir currently has no information about the boy he helped save, he knows that they could meet in the future. The identity of donors and recipients remains confidential for a year, but after that, should both parties desire, they may meet. Amir is hopeful he will one day meet the recipient. 'If he wants, I would be honored,' he said. 'For me, it wasn’t much — it’s all worth it if he gets to live.'

‘Free Palestine’ bomber torches hundreds of ballots in Pacific no...	Election staff are now sorting through damaged ballots to identify affected voters for replacement ballots. By Jewish Breaking News Federal investigators are investigating a series of ballot box attacks in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, where the perpetrator left anti-Israel messages on explosive devices. The first attack occurred in Vancouver on October 8, followed by two more strikes on Monday targeting ballot boxes in both Portland and Vancouver. Law enforcement sources confirmed to the Associated Press that the devices were marked with 'Free Gaza' and 'Free Palestine' slogans. While the initial attack resulted in no ballot damage and Portland’s box sustained minimal impact with only three ballots affected, the Vancouver attack proved more devastating with approximately 475 ballots destroyed. Election staff are now undertaking the process of sorting through damaged ballots to identify affected voters for replacement ballots.

Kilbane (former Congressional candidate) (@Kilbanewins) October 28, 2024 Local authorities believe they’re hunting an experienced metalworker, described as a balding white male between 30 and 40 years old, who may be plotting additional strikes. The suspect’s vehicle, captured on surveillance footage, is a black 2001-2004 Volvo S-60 missing its front license plate but sporting an unidentified rear plate. Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey, who labeled the incidents a 'direct attack on democracy,' has since implemented beefed-up security measures. These include increased police patrols around ballot drop locations and 24/7 surveillance of ballot boxes by Clark County Elections Office employees until the election concludes.

IDF to strengthen eastern border with new division	Israel’s border with Jordan is the Jewish state’s longest, spanning nearly 200 miles. By Joshua Marks, JNS On Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces announced the establishment of a new division to defend the country’s border with Jordan. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi approved the Eastern Division, with the latter saying that 'strengthening defense along the borders in general, and on the eastern border in particular, was set as a goal before the war,' adding that 'in the wake of Oct. 7 and recent events, it has taken on added urgency.' Israel’s border with Jordan is the Jewish state’s longest, spanning nearly 200 miles. While Jerusalem has a peace treaty with Amman and the two countries cooperate on security, recent cross-border terrorist attacks have caused concern. On Oct. 18, two terrorists who had crossed the border from Jordan south of the Dead Sea carried out a shooting. Two Israelis were wounded, one moderately and one lightly, before the attackers could be neutralized. Last month, three security guards at the Allenby Bridge crossing in the Jordan Valley were murdered in another terrorist shooting. The gunman, who according to the IDF was a Jordanian citizen, was killed. He was later named as Maher D’yab Hussein Jazi, a 39-year-old truck driver from the city of Irbid. 'There is an urgent need to establish additional units in both regular service and reserves to alleviate the burden on reserve personnel. In light of this, we have decided to establish a division to strengthen defense on the eastern border. This decision is essential in view of the anticipated challenges and in line with our force-building processes,' the IDF said. 'The division’s purpose is to strengthen defense in the border area, Route 90 and nearby communities, providing a response to terrorism events and arms smuggling, while maintaining a peaceful border and reinforcing cooperation with the Jordanian army,' the statement continued. The division will be subordinate to IDF Central Command. Days after the Sept. 8 attack at the Allenby crossing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the border, saying that Jerusalem would work with Jordan to strengthen the Jewish state’s eastern frontier to maintain 'peace and security' in the border area. 'We are fighting on multiple fronts,' Netanyahu said alongside Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also serves as a minister in the Defense Ministry with authority over civilian issues in Judea and Samaria. 'In this multi-front battle, we know we need to secure our eastern border with Jordan. It is a border of peace,' he continued. 'We cooperate with the Kingdom of Jordan to ensure that it remains so.' The premier noted however that 'challenges are increasing' as Iran, and its terrorist allies are increasingly using the porous border to smuggle weapons into Judea, Samaria and Israeli cities. 'We will work to erect a stronger barrier here to stop smuggling attempts. We do it in coordination with our neighbors. We must ensure that this border remains a border of peace and security,' he concluded.

Israeli indicted for spying on nuclear scientist on behalf of Ira...	Weiss also set fire to vehicles, flung pipes on Israeli roads, sprayed graffiti, and hung hundreds of inflammatory banners in Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan calling for civilian riots. By Pesach Benson, TPS Prosecutors in Tel Aviv filed an indictment on Thursday against an Israeli man accused of spying on a nuclear scientist who Iranian intelligence sought to assassinate. The announcement came after it was cleared for publication that an Israeli couple were also arrested for spying for Iran. Asher Binyamin Weiss, a resident of Bnei Brak, is accused of using a Go Pro camera to record the home and car of an Israeli nuclear scientist, whose name is prohibited from publication. According to the indictment, the video was sent to an Iranian handler. Under the direction of the Iranian agent, Weiss also set fire to vehicles, threw pipes on Israeli roads, sprayed graffiti and hung hundreds of inflammatory banners in Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan calling for civilian riots. Also on Thursday, it was cleared for publication that authorities arrested an Israeli couple in their 30s suspected of gathering intelligence on sensitive national infrastructure sites and tracking high-profile academic figures on behalf of Iranian agents. The suspects were identified as Rafael Goliev and his wife, Lela, of Lod. They were recruited in what the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) described as 'a covert Iranian intelligence network targeting Israeli citizens of Caucasian descent.' According to Shin Bet sources, Rafael Goliev was reportedly recruited by Elshan Agayev, a 56-year-old Azeri operative working on behalf of Iranian officials. The investigation found that Goliev carried out surveillance missions, including monitoring sensitive security sites such as the Mossad headquarters. Additionally, he gathered intelligence on a female academic affiliated with the Institute for National Security Studies, a think tank affiliated with Tel Aviv University. At one point, Goliev was instructed to find a potential assassin to act on Iran’s orders. His wife, Lela, reportedly assisted him in some of these operations.

Samaria civilian security squads to receive sniper rifles	The council also purchased advanced defense equipment, including surveillance drones and night vision devices, it said on Wednesday. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS In a first, civilian security units throughout the 30-plus communities in Samaria will soon be equipped with brand-new designated-marksman rifles (DMRs), the Samaria Regional Council said on Wednesday. The Gilboa DMR rifles, which have an effective range of more than 700 meters (765 yards), were purchased by Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan with the help of donors from around the world. 'We are doing everything we can to be as prepared as possible for any scenario, and we thank our friends worldwide, who are mobilizing and helping Samaria during this difficult and tense period,' said Dagan. 'This tremendous support allows us to be strong and confident, standing shoulder to shoulder with the Israel Defense Forces and the defense establishment, in order to guarantee our security,' he said. According to the Samaria Regional Council, the new rifles are considered the best in the Jewish state and 'change the equation in the face of threats of harm to the lives of the communities’ residents.' לראשונה בישראל: רובי צלפים לכיתות הכוננות בשומרון. ראש המועצה יוסי דגן רכש 31 רובי צלפים מסוג גלבוע DMR לטווח של 700 מטר מכספי תרומות שגייס מידידי השומרון מרחבי העולם עבור כיתות הכוננות. בנוסף לכך סבסדה המועצה באמצעות התרומות רכישת אקדחים ל 500 נשים תושבות השומרון. pic.twitter.com/rS7XOs8KKY &mdash; מנדי ריזל (@mendi_rizel) October 30, 2024 Since the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 massacre in southern Israel, the Samaria Regional Council, with the help of global donors, has acquired many pieces of new equipment, including hundreds of IWI ARAD and Emtan rifles, 700 pistol conversion kits and 1,300 vests and helmets. The council also purchased advanced defense equipment including surveillance drones and night vision devices, it said on Wednesday. With the assistance of donors, the council also helped subsidize the purchase of 500 guns for female residents of Samaria 'with the aim of strengthening the communities’ defense capabilities,' it stated. Standby squads in Judea and Samaria are made up of locals, usually former military, who train together and serve as first-response teams, holding down the fort until regular IDF troops arrive. At least two kibbutzim in Israel’s western Negev were saved during Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre because of the actions of such squads. Late last year, the United States blocked a shipment of some 27,000 U.S.-made rifles intended for the Israel Police out of fear they could make their way into the hands of 'extremist Israeli settlers' in Judea and Samaria. In the first half of 2024, Judea and Samaria saw more than 500 Arab terrorist attacks each month on average, according to figures published on Aug. 1 by Rescuers Without Borders (Hatzalah Judea and Samaria). During that period, first responders recorded 3,272 terrorist acts in the region, including 1,868 stonings, 456 fire bombings, 299 attacks involving explosives and 109 shootings. Terrorists murdered 14 people and wounded more than 155 others in Judea and Samaria between January and June, the rescue group said.

Hezbollah rockets kill seven in northern Israel	An Israeli strike in Lebanon this week killed a Hezbollah regional anti-tank missile commander, the IDF confirmed on Thursday. By Joshua Marks, JNS Seven people were killed and one person was seriously wounded on Thursday in two separate Hezbollah rocket attacks on Israel’s north. The first attack triggered sirens at 11:37 a.m., and two projectiles from Lebanon landed in an open area outside the largely evacuated Upper Galilee city of Metula, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The fatalities were an Israeli farmer and four foreign workers, and the seriously wounded individual was another foreign worker, Metula council head David Azoulai told Israel’s Kan News. Later on Thursday, another attack from Lebanon killed two people, while lightly wounding another, in a field off Route 79 near the Haifa suburb of Kiryat Ata, Magen David Adom first responders reported. 'Paramedics provided medical treatment and CPR, following which a 30-year-old man and a 60-year-old woman were pronounced dead, and a 71-year-old man was evacuated to Rambam Hospital due to minor shrapnel wounds,' the emergency service said in a statement. Three Israelis were wounded in Hezbollah attacks on northern Israel on Wednesday, according to medics. A 70-year-old man was lightly wounded when rocket shrapnel hit his car in the Upper Galilee, the Magen David Adom emergency service said. The victim suffered a minor head wound and was evacuated to Ziv Hospital in Safed. Earlier, two farmers were wounded, including one seriously, when a Hezbollah rocket struck an agricultural field near the evacuated Israeli border town of Metula. The other victim was lightly wounded. On Wednesday morning, the Iran-backed terror army launched a missile that triggered sirens as far south as Netanya. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the missile broke up in the air. The IDF also reported that three drones had crossed from Lebanon into the Western Galilee, all of which were intercepted. No injuries were reported in the incidents. Additionally, a drone strike early Wednesday in Nahariya caused minor damage to an aerospace component facility. The IDF was investigating why alarms weren’t triggered by the attack. Hezbollah regional commander killed in IAF strike An Israeli strike in Lebanon this week killed a Hezbollah regional anti-tank missile commander, the IDF confirmed on Thursday. Muhammad Khalil Alian was eliminated in an attack in the Southern Lebanese village of Burj Qallawiyah, according to the IDF. He led the Iranian proxy’s anti-tank missile array in the Hajir area as part of the terrorist group’s 'Nasser' unit, which is responsible for attacks on northern Israel’s Ramim Ridge region. חוסל מפקד מערך הנ'ט של גזרת חג'יר בחיזבאללה: הותקפו עשרות מחסני אמצעי לחימה ותשתיות טרור במרחב ג׳באליה מטוסי קרב תקפו וחיסלו במהלך השבוע את המחבל מחמד חליל עליאן במרחב ברג' קאלויה, שפיקד על מערך הנ'ט של גזרת חג'יר ביחידת ׳נצר׳ של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה. במהלך היממה האחרונה,… pic.twitter.com/f7wXewEDge &mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) October 31, 2024 According to the Alma Research and Education Center, Nasser is one of three geographic units operating under Hezbollah’s southern front command.

Couple from Lod arrested as Iranian spies	This is the fourth espionage case cracked over the last few months by the Israeli security authorities. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An Israeli couple from Lod have been arrested for allegedly spying for Iran for the last three years, the police and Shabak announced Thursday. The authorities said that Rafael and Lala Guliyev had gathered intelligence on and photographed such sensitive installations as Mossad headquarters. The couple, in their early thirties, also allegedly collected information on a female employee of the Institute for National Security Studies think tank, which studies terrorism and conflicts in the Middle East. Tehran had her 'marked for harm,' they said. Rafael Guliyev also revealed to his interrogators that he had been asked to find a hit-man for his handler, a 56-year-old Azeri man named Alhan Agayev. A senior Shabak official pointed out that this was not the first Iranian attempt to recruit spies 'in order to promote espionage and terrorist activity in Israel.' 'These incidents join a series of foiled plots that have been revealed in recent weeks, in which Israeli citizens were arrested who were employed by Iranian intelligence agents and carried out missions on their behalf,' the official said. Three other spy cases have been brought to light recently as the war with Tehran terror proxies Hamas and Hezbollah continues into its second year. Also on Thursday, the Tel Aviv District Court indicted Bnei Brak resident Asher Benjamin Weiss for allegedly taking videos of the home and car of an Israeli nuclear scientist on orders from Tehran, and sending them to an eastern Jerusalem resident to enable him to assassinate the man and his family. He was charged with contact with a foreign agent, providing intelligence to an enemy and obstruction of justice. When the police were tipped off in September about the plot, the incipient attacker was arrested along with six other men, aged 19-23, all from the Beit Safafa neighborhood of the capital. Their indictments include aiding the enemy during wartime and providing intelligence to an enemy. In September, the Shabak announced that it had arrested a 73-year-old Israeli businessman who had allegedly agreed to carry out a high-profile murder of a leading Israeli figure, possibly even the prime minister, in an act of retaliation for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital, which greatly embarrassed the mullahs. Ten days ago, a publication ban was lifted on a case in which seven Jews from northern Israel allegedly gathered intelligence on Israeli air force bases, the IDF’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv, and Iron Dome defense systems. Like the Guliyevs, the work of the ring, which included an AWOL soldier and two minors, predated the current war, this time by a year. The authorities have not yet said whether their motivation was solely monetary, as they were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for their espionage work, but the fact that they continued throughout the war made their actions especially 'severe,' said the prosecutors. The police statement on the Guliyev capture noted that the security services are 'working night and day to locate and foil activity against the state’s citizens, and will act with a harsh and intolerant hand against those unscrupulous criminals who collaborate with the enemy and endanger the public and the country.'

French court nixes attempt to ban Israelis from defense exhibitio...	The Euronaval organizers had heeded the French government decision that Israeli companies were not allowed to have stands or show their wares. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A French court nixed Wednesday a government-led attempt to leave Israelis out of an international defense exhibition, drawing praise from the petitioners. The Manufacturers Association, Israel Shipyards and the France-Israel Chamber of Commerce had appealed to the Commercial Court in Paris after the organizers of Euronaval heeded a call by French President Emanuel Macron to ban Israeli companies from having stands or showing their wares due to the country's ongoing war against Hamas and Hezbollah. Upset over Israel entering Lebanon, a former French protectorate, to erase the terrorist threat on its border, Macron had also called for an arms embargo on the Jewish state. The court ruled that barring the firms does not comply with the European Union’s rules of the free market and is contrary to the principles of equality and non-discrimination. Manufacturers Association head Dr. Ron Tomer cheered the decision. 'The court clarified today that business discrimination on a political basis cannot be accepted in the international market,' he said. 'No government or organizing body will stop us, and as many attempts as this occur in the future, we will make it clear to everyone that 'Made in Israel' will continue to be proudly displayed at international exhibitions and conferences,' he added. 'This is a victory for the State of Israel and Israeli businesses that makes it clear that everyone is subject to the principles of equality and fair trade to which we are committed.' Foreign Minister Israel Katz declared on X that the court’s ruling was 'an important victory for justice and a clear message against attempts to weaken Israel in its fight against the forces of evil.' Israel Shipyards CEO Eitan Zuker took the opportunity to warn Jerusalem that the country had to be more self-sufficient regarding its security. 'Despite the court's decision,' he said, 'it should be remembered that the French government, in fact, imposed a security embargo on Israel by trying to prevent Israeli companies from participating in the exhibition. 'This requires the decision-makers to understand that, as we saw in other cases during the war, Israel must not be dependent on other countries and it must rely on its high-level, independent capabilities and that of the Israeli military industry, especially regarding equipping itself with essential platforms.' In announcing their petition on X Monday, the Israeli groups had written, 'On behalf of the State of Israel and the entire Jewish people, we want to send a clear and decisive message&#8230;that we are done turning the other cheek when attempts are made to boycott us, even if it is ‘only’ business-related harm.' The twelve firms that had planned to participate in what is dubbed 'the world’s leading naval defense exhibition' are now back on track for the November 4-7 event. These include such leaders in the defense field as Rafael, Elbit, and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI).

In preliminary reading: Terror supporters definition widened to n...	The emendation of the Basic Law: The Knesset is a legislative answer to Supreme Court rulings allowing extremist Arabs to run. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Knesset passed the preliminary reading of an amendment to a Basic Law Wednesday that widens the definition of who is a terror supporter so that extremists can be more easily banned from running for parliament. The new grounds for disqualification to be embedded in Basic Law: The Knesset include expressing support for an individual terrorist, contrary to the existing law that only speaks of support for a terrorist organization. A few statements will now be enough, whereas before it was necessary to have a 'critical mass' of statements or actions exhibiting approval or sympathy for nationalist crimes. In addition, a party of terror sympathizers within a combined list will no longer be protected by its fellow factions that do not express such sentiments. Finally, confirmation of the Knesset Elections Committee’s disqualification will not require Supreme Court approval as has been the case until now, although it will be able to hear appeals. Coalition head Ophir Katz authored the changes after years of the Supreme Court overruling the Committee’s decisions to disallow certain Arab Israeli lists or individuals due to their support of Palestinian terrorism. The bill passed 61-35, but not before an uproar had ensued in the plenum when Minister of Social Equality and the Advancement of the Status of Women May Golan presented the government’s support for Katz’s private bill. She called out the Arab legislators in general for being 'agents of our enemies' and 'Palestinian collaborators,' and quoted individual MKs’ past statements that would disqualify them once the amendment passes into law. These included Hadash MK Aida Touma-Suleiman’s saying that she would not call Hamas a terror organization, and her party leader, Ayman Odeh, praising longtime Hezbollah terror chief Hassan Nasrallah as a 'model of self-sacrifice' after the IDF assassinated him in his Beirut bunker several weeks ago. Golan was called to order several times by the acting speaker of the Knesset for calling MKs insulting names from the podium, and he eventually had her removed from the hall by Knesset ushers. All except one member of Yesh Atid voted against the bill, with party head Yair Lapid attacking it as a 'racist' law 'that says ‘We lost ten seats on October 7 so we’ll use the Knesset to subtract ten seats in our favor&#8230;. The real name of the law is the 'Law for the Abolition of the Opposition.'' Katz expressed satisfaction over his bill’s passing its first legislative hurdle. 'There is no other country in the world that would allow terror supporters to act as members of Parliament, and I say to the Supreme Court judges, the nation is not taking this anymore,' he said. 'Do you think these decisions make you more enlightened than us? More liberal? More advanced? You are not. No more awards for terrorism, that will change from now on.' The bill will now go to committee to be refined before returning for its second and third readings.

Republicans call out Biden for calling Trump voters ‘garbage’	U.S President Joe Biden said, 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a statement that seems to echo 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate Hilary Clinton's notorious 'basket of deplorables' comment, Republicans are calling out President Joe Biden for saying Trump voters are garbage. Biden was responding, as many Democrats have, to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at the Madison Square Garden Trump rally last week, referring to Puerto Rico as a 'floating island of garbage.' Speaking at a virtual Harris campaign event with Voto Latino, a prominent Latino voter and civic outreach organization in the U.S, Joe Biden said, 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.' '[Trump's] demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it is un-American,' he added. Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt responded, 'Add this to the 'basket of deplorables' and 'nazi' slurs against Americans. Why do so many Democrat leaders hate so many of our fellow Americans?' 'As a Republican member of Congress, I've met with many of my constituents who are Democrats, Libertarians, NPA, and Independents. I would NEVER call them garbage. What are you doing @POTUS?' Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna tweeted. Donald Trump wrote, 'Holy s***. The media spent all week crying about a joke from a comedian. Meanwhile, Tim Walz called Trump supporters Nazis. Kamala Harris refused to condemn it. And now Kamala's biggest Democrat ally, Joe Biden, is calling all Trump supporters 'garbage.' Absolutely disgusting!!!' Last week, Kamala Harris answered in the affirmative when asked if she thought Donald Trump was a fascist. Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams was spotted outside of a Trump rally in Madison Square Garden. When asked about Harris's remarks, he said, 'I have heard those terms hurled at me by some political leaders in the city, using terms like Hitler and fascist. My answer is no, I know what Hitler has done, and I know what a fascist regime looks like.'

US ceasefire proposal would force retreat of Hezbollah from borde...	The proposal, presented by top US security official Amos Hochstein, outlines an initial 60-day truce followed by a permanent ceasefire. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An initial draft of a US ceasefire proposal calls for Hezbollah to comply with a previous agreement to retreat from Lebanon's border with Israel and for the IDF to withdraw from Lebanon within a week, as reported by Kan news. The proposal, presented by top US security official Amos Hochstein, outlines an initial 60-day truce followed by a permanent ceasefire. One requirement is the enforcement of UN Resolution 1701, adopted at the end of the Second Lebanon War in 2006, that called for 'the establishment between the Blue Line and the Litani river of an area free of any armed personnel, assets, and weapons other than those of the Government of Lebanon.' The enforcement of Resolution 1701 would create a buffer zone free from Hezbollah and would potentially allow the safe return to their homes of over 40,000 displaced Israelis. The current ceasefire proposal stipulates that only the Lebanese army, besides UNIFIL, would be the only armed group in Southern Lebanon. For its part, Israel would retreat from Lebanon and refrain from carrying out any operations against military targets. The Lebanese government would supervise sales and production of weapons. After the retreat of Hezbollah, 5,000 to 10,000 Lebanese army troops would be deployed at the border with Israel, and UNIFIL forces would be increased, perhaps with the addition of soldiers from France, Germany, and the UK. Following this phase, an international body will observe activity on the Lebanese-Israel border and ensure compliance. According to US officials, the US has agreed that if UNIFIL and the Lebanese army refuse to deal with violations by Hezbollah, the IDF would be allowed to take action against the terror group. The third phase involves permanent efforts to prevent Iran from rearming and blocking means to transfer weapons to the terror group by air, land, or sea. Western officials said that Iran may allow or even encourage Hezbollah to agree to a ceasefire even though the war in Gaza continues.

As Iran’s proxies target US troops, Biden-Harris admin privately ...	Three American soldiers were killed in January in a drone attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon The Biden-Harris administration is privately claiming to Congress that no Iranians have been involved in drone attacks on Americans over the past year, drawing criticism from lawmakers and experts who say the government is intentionally denying the extent of Iran's aggression in the Middle East. In a non-public assessment provided to Congress last month, the State Department said it 'has not identified any Iranian persons' responsible for attacking 'a U.S. citizen from October 27, 2023, to July 23, 2024, using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),' according to a copy of the previously unreported notice reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. The assessment was transmitted to lawmakers against the backdrop of a massive Iran-fueled war in the Middle East, where Tehran’s terror proxies are wreaking havoc on Israel, attacking international shipping lines, and targeting American forces stationed in the region. Drones are a key weapon for Iran’s allies and have been used on the battlefield by Hezbollah, Hamas, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, Syrian militants, and, most prolifically, Tehran-backed militia groups in Iraq. Three American soldiers were killed in January in a drone attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan, which President Joe Biden said was 'carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq.' The State Department's late September analysis was mandated under a 2024 law that required a report to Congress on 'any Iranian person that has attacked a United States citizen using an unmanned combat aerial vehicle.' While the State Department’s analysis is technically accurate as written, Biden-Harris officials reinterpreted the law so that the report only included Iranians 'directly involved' in launching drones at Americans. This legal distinction enabled the administration to officially claim it 'does not possess evidence that any Iranian persons' were involved in launching drones at Americans—even though a mounting body of evidence shows a number of Iranian-controlled terror proxies have done so. Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), who is responsible for authoring the portion of the law requiring a drone report, said the State Department intentionally misinterpreted the legal requirements to avoid identifying Iran as the principal source of drone attacks on Americans in the region. 'It's obvious that State Department lawyers worked overtime to deny Iran's role in attacking Americans, and it's also obvious why they did so,' Cruz told the Free Beacon. 'The Biden-Harris administration has been financing Iran's war against America and our allies since the day they took office. They have allowed over $100 billion to flow towards the Ayatollah, which enabled the Iranian regime to finance not just the October 7 terrorist attack on Israel but attacks on our soldiers across the Middle East. Rather than acknowledge the Iranian regime's role in those attacks, they have chosen to lawlessly ignore them.' A State Department spokesman maintained the report faithfully followed 'the specific reporting requirements' Congress mandated. 'The Biden Administration takes seriously the range of threats posed by Iran to the safety and security of U.S. citizens, including those posed by Iran’s UAV proliferation,' the spokesman said. 'That is among the reasons why we have conducted self-defense strikes in response to Iranian-enabled attacks in Syria, Iraq, and Jordan, as well as in Yemen and its surrounding waterways.' The United States is also imposing fresh sanctions on those 'involved in Iran’s UAV program' and will 'respond to this evolving threat' as needed, the State Department said. Michael Knights, an analyst who has closely tracked Iran-backed attacks for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank, said the State Department’s assessment suggests 'the U.S. government is not keen to openly state that Iran is functionally at war with the United States, hence the use of legalese to describe Iranian involvement.' Iranian nationals, Nights added, 'were clearly involved in designing the Shahed-101 and KAS-04 drones that are used to attack U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria.' Iran’s terror proxies have continuously targeted American and Israeli positions in the region since Hamas’s Oct. 7 terror spree. This includes a spate of attacks on U.S. outposts in Iraq and Syria, according to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, which identified the various terror factions responsible for the attacks as operating under Iran’s orders. The State Department made a similar determination but would not attribute these strikes directly to Iran, even though the groups involved are directed by Tehran. 'Iran relies on and supports an extensive network of proxies and partners in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen that can conduct armed operations aligned with Iran’s interests, including against U.S. forces in the region,' the State Department said in its report to Congress. Iran-aligned militia groups in Iraq and Syria conducted 'upwards of 170 attacks against U.S. forces since October 2023, the majority of which involved the use of UAVs.' The State Department noted that Iran’s 'lethal aid, training, and advice' enabled 'many of these attacks' on Americans. Still, the State Department maintained that the 'individuals identified as conducting the attacks were non-Iranian foreign national members of proxy or partner groups.' One former U.S. official who worked on Middle East issues described the State Department’s determination as laughable, saying, 'Any suggestion that Iran doesn’t have influence over and direct not just Iraqi militias but the Iraqi government is disingenuous.' Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the source added, 'has near full control of Iraqi militias, including decisions on whether or not to attack U.S. personnel. Those decisions are not made in Baghdad by Iraqis—they are made by Iranians and the IRGC.'

School under siege: Kibbutz Yehiam families innovate amid daily r...	The kibbutz’s bomb shelters and protected rooms were converted into classrooms and organized by subject, with 112 students in grades 1-6 now learning at the kibbutz. By Noah Michaeli, TPS For the families of Kibbutz Yehiam, sending their children to school during Hezbollah’s daily rocket barrages on northern Israel was a difficult task. 'The local authorities decided to send the children back to elementary school, but the only school is half an hour from Yehiam,' Yehiam resident and mother of two Roni Egozi Aberman told The Press Service of Israel. 'While they decided to send the children back to school, they didn’t renew school buses.' This meant that each child would have to be driven by their parents twice a day for half an hour each way, without any cover, under missile fire. The community’s residents, however, were determined to find a safer way to educate their children. 'The parents here got organized. They got together and decided to arrange their own school, here in the kibbutz,' said Egozi Aberman, whose children are in fourth and fifth grade. In addition, it was important to the parents of Yehiam that the school itself be safe. As a result, the kibbutz’s bomb shelters and protected rooms were converted into classrooms — organized by subject. Around 112 students in grades 1-6 now learn at the kibbutz, but the number varies with children from nearby communities also attending if it is safe for them to drive. Wednesday marked the kibbutz school’s first in-person classes since Hezbollah’s communication devices blew up on Sept. 17 and 18. According to Local Council Chairman and Yehiam resident Niv Moran, the drive behind this initiative came entirely from the kibbutz’s residents, who found a creative solution to a pressing problem. 'The parents innovated,' Moran told TPS-IL. 'We talked to the relevant people in the local government and they helped us with everything we needed to turn our bomb shelters into proper places for learning.' The entire community came together to clean, furnish, and prepare all the new classrooms ahead of the first day of school, Moran said. Said Egozi Aberman, 'Everyone in the community contributed something, whatever they had at home, to make sure that the classrooms were properly prepared.' Moran attributed the community’s success to both the strong group effort and to Yehiam’s effective organizers and administrators. 'I’d especially like to thank Idan Raz, our kibbutz’s community manager,' Moran says. 'He helped us with everything we needed.' 'Five teachers come every morning,' Egozi Aberman explains. 'Each one teaches something different, all the core subjects that are the most important for the children to learn.' After a year of war and uncertainty, Moran is happy to be part of a solution that gives his children, and the children of his community, some stability. 'Real lessons! In-person, exactly like children at that age need,' Moran says. For residents of northern communities like Yehiam, where child education has been interrupted by over a year of war, safely returning children to school is a huge achievement. 'My son is in third grade,' Moran adds, 'and to see him there in class, meeting his friends, it’s really, truly something else.' After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon.

A day with an IDF artillery battalion	The 155-millimeter shells are propelled by explosive guided by targeting crews to make sure the firepower is directed at Hezbollah. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS Israel Defense Forces Artillery Corps units, which stand guard in the country’s north and south, ready at a moment’s notice to rain fire on the enemy, are the last thing Hezbollah and Hamas want to face across a battlefield. Although not often in the headlines, without the relentless work of these battalions, Israel’s ongoing ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza would not be possible, and northern Israel would be facing many more deadly rocket attacks today. On Tuesday, JNS joined the 405 Artillery Battery of the 411st Battalion, which is a part of the 282nd Fire Brigade. This battalion has been providing crucial firepower support for IDF forces in Lebanon, their shells acting as pillars of fire and smoke before the camp, while also playing a critical role in defending Israel’s northern towns and villages. Under a warm fall sun and the regular threat of Hezbollah rocket fire, the battery’s soldiers and officers prepared, as they do every day, their 155-millimeter self-propelled artillery guns for rapid action. Readiness is critical for this unit, which must be able to provide fire support for ground forces within seconds of receiving the request, as well as respond to intelligence from a variety of sources on Hezbollah targets.

'Before I came here, for the past seven years I hadn’t fired a single real shell, only in exercises. The soldiers here now began firing real shells on their third or fourth day here, on behalf of the forces in the field,' Capt. Guy (full name withheld), the battery commander. 'Ultimately, what we’re doing here is conducting missions to destroy the enemy, which is trying to fire on our maneuvering forces or launch rockets into Israeli territory,' he added. Tragically, that threat materialized later the same day when a civilian was killed by a Hezbollah rocket in the town of Ma’alot Tarshiha, several kilometers from the border. However, many such threats have been thwarted and destroyed by the Artillery Corps. Capt. Guy explained that a rapid sensor-to-shooter cycle is the key. The 155 millimeter shells are propelled by explosives, and while considered to be 'statistical' (not precision-guided) weapons, the computer-controlled gun barrels and the targeting crews make sure the firepower is directed at Hezbollah. Sometimes, the battalion launches smoke shells to provide screens for maneuvering forces. Other times, they fire illumination shells that light up the battlefield. The shells can reach targets some 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) away. Soldiers here 'know they can go to sleep at night, wake up at 4 a.m., start firing shells to complete the [sensor to shooter] cycle quickly, and go back to sleep,' said Capt. Guy. 'Twenty minutes later, they can be scrambled again,' he added. 'I had an event here where I headed out for an exercise with the entire battery, we left the sector, and suddenly at 2:30 a.m. I was told we have a firing incident. One of the IDF units had entered Lebanon, and suddenly we went from an exercise to firing tens of shells,' he recalled. The artillery units interact with the rest of the ground forces using the IDF’s combat network system, known as Torch X, which displays, in real time, the location of friendly and enemy forces. A liaison soldier from a division requiring assistance often passes on a request for fire support and gives enemy position data. The battery’s soldiers then run calculations before sending the data to the guns. 'Our intelligence, as opposed to Oct. 7 [2023] when it failed, is working today in a phenomenal manner, both here and in Gaza,' said Capt. Guy. The battery regularly receives targeting data on enemy rocket squads on their way to attack Israel. Thwarting these attacks requires both speed and accuracy. Shells not only pose a direct threat to enemy forces, they also keep the enemy pinned down,' the captain explained. 'No one wants to move from where they are, lying on the ground or underground, when 155-millimeter shells are falling,' he said. The statistical nature of the weapons contribute to this pinning effect, he added. 'Hezbollah has all of its weapons ready underground. They head out to conduct fire, but once we close the cycle quickly, they lose motivation,' he said. The unit has also struck rocket launchers. If sensitive civilian sites like schools and mosques are near the targets, the unit carefully conducts checks to receive approval, and ensures that the area is almost entirely empty of civilians. 'We know, and it’s no secret, that in some of the villages, civilian sites have been used as combat infrastructure … and in those cases they were destroyed,' he said. 'But those cases first needed approval.' The 411 Battalion arrived in the north from Gaza in February, and has since been fighting Hezbollah. The battalion was the first artillery unit to cross the border into Gaza (rather than firing from within Israeli territory) in a decade, which carried additional risk. 'Here too, we are ready for any scenario,' he added. Hezbollah would dearly like to hit positions such as this, and has repeatedly attempted to do so. Cpl. Mia, a member of the IDF’s 411th Artillery Battalion, in northern Israel on Oct. 29, 2024. Credit: IDF Spokesperson’s Office. Cpl. Mia, 20, who emigrated to Israel from the United States and enlisted in the IDF after the Oct. 7 massacre, shared some of her operational experiences with JNS. 'Over eight months ago, we arrived in the north after being active in southern Gaza for four months,' she said. 'We’re firing shells here every day, assisting forces on the ground. It’s easy to lose morale because we are not like the forces on the ground that see everything with their own eyes and understand the significance of what they are doing, but we are truly doing very significant things,' she added. 'The forces speak to us over the communications network and thank us for what we are doing. We are saving them, and getting them out of danger.' In recent weeks, she recalled, a maneuvering force in Lebanon came under Hezbollah fire, and within a minute a smoke shell was in the air, providing life-threatening cover. 'We heard a couple of days later that we really saved them, and that without this, the entire incident would have turned out very differently. It was very moving to hear this. To hear that what we are doing on the ground is really significant,' she added.

Scientists identify cancer mechanism that could transform immunot...	This discovery could lead to an entirely new class of treatments to better harness the immune system’s power. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli researchers uncovered a groundbreaking mechanism in cancer treatment that could potentially eradicate tumors resistant to current immunotherapies. Scientists from Tel Aviv University identified a previously unknown cancer mechanism that prevents the immune system from attacking tumors effectively. In an unexpected twist, they found that by reversing this mechanism, the immune system is stimulated to attack and eliminate cancer cells. Their research, led by Professor Carmit Levy, Professor Yaron Carmi, and MD/PhD candidate Avishai Maliah, was recently published in the peer-reviewed Nature Communications journal. The breakthrough came about by chance, as Professor Levy’s lab is dedicated to studying both cancer and the impact of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the immune system. UV exposure is known to suppress immune activity in the skin 'Cancer and UV radiation both suppress the immune system, but the mechanism was unclear. While most researchers focus directly on cancer mechanisms, we took a different approach by examining how UV radiation affects immune suppression in the skin,' Levy explained. This unique approach led to the unexpected discovery of a protein that plays a pivotal role in immune suppression. The team then embarked on an extensive study of immune system changes triggered by UV exposure. Using a mouse model, Maliah examined the behaviors of various proteins in response to UV exposure and observed a notable increase in a protein called Ly6a—a relatively under-researched protein. This discovery marked the beginning of a pivotal understanding of Ly6a’s role in immune suppression and its potential applications in cancer therapy. As the researchers continued their investigations, they uncovered that Ly6a functions as a brake on the immune system, specifically affecting T cells that play a crucial role in combating cancer. 'After exposure to UV radiation, we noticed that T cells began expressing high levels of Ly6a, which seemed to inhibit the immune response,' explained Maliah. 'Our hypothesis was that by releasing this brake, we could restore optimal immune activation.' Further study revealed that Ly6a is not only present in UV-exposed skin cells but also overexpressed in certain cancerous tumors. According to Levy, they found heightened Ly6a levels in melanoma and colon cancer cells, suggesting a broader mechanism by which cancer cells deactivate the immune system. 'We were able to observe that this protein desensitizes immune T cells in multiple cancers. By treating tumors with Ly6a antibodies, we saw a significant reduction in tumor size,' Levy explained. The discovery of Ly6a could have significant implications in the field of immunotherapy, an area of cancer treatment that has made substantial progress over the last decade by harnessing the body’s immune system to combat cancer. However, approximately half of all patients fail to respond to widely used PD1-based therapies, which often have side effects on the immune system. 'We found that antibodies targeting Ly6a eradicated tumors in our animal models, even in cases where tumors were resistant to PD1 therapy,' Carmi said. 'This opens the door to developing an entirely new class of drugs targeting Ly6a, potentially helping a significant portion of patients who do not respond to existing immunotherapies.' The researchers stress that further study is needed to translate these findings into a clinical setting. Current efforts are focused on developing a drug based on these findings to test its efficacy and safety in human trials. If developed into a viable drug, this discovery could lead to an entirely new class of treatments to better harness the immune system’s power. 'Cancer treatment has made huge strides with immunotherapy, but gaps remain. With our discovery, we are working toward closing these gaps and offering a new, effective treatment for patients worldwide,' said Carmi.

Hezbollah rockets wound three in northern Israel	The IDF also reported on Wednesday morning that three drones had crossed from Lebanon into the Western Galilee, all of which were intercepted By JNS Three Israelis were wounded in Hezbollah attacks on northern Israel on Wednesday, according to medics. A 70-year-old man was lightly wounded when rocket shrapnel hit his car in the Upper Galilee, the Magen David Adom emergency service said. The victim suffered a minor head wound and was evacuated to Ziv Hospital in Safed. Earlier, two farmers were wounded, including one seriously, when a Hezbollah rocket struck an agricultural field near the evacuated Israeli border town of Metula. The other victim was lightly wounded. The two were transported by helicopter to Rambam Medical Center in Haifa for treatment. On Wednesday morning, the Iranian-backed terror army launched a missile that triggered sirens as far south as Netanya. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the missile broke up in the air. The IDF also reported on Wednesday morning that three drones had crossed from Lebanon into the Western Galilee, all of which were intercepted. Israel Fire and Rescue services were operating to extinguish a blaze ignited in the area of Gesher HaZiv. No injuries were reported in the incidents. Additionally, a drone strike early Wednesday in Nahariya caused minor damage to an aerospace component facility. The IDF was investigating why alarms weren’t triggered by the attack. The IDF said that as of 3 p.m. local time on Wednesday, 50 projectiles had been fired into Israel by Hezbollah. On Tuesday, one person was killed by a Hezbollah rocket in the northern Israeli town of Ma’alot Tarshiha. Israeli media identified the fatality as Mohammad Naim, 24. Also on Tuesday, a Hezbollah drone detonated over a pedestrian bridge in Nahariya in northwestern Israel. No injuries were reported. Israeli Air Force eliminates Radwan commander The IDF announced on Wednesday that Mustafa Ahmad Shakhadi, deputy commander of Hezbollah’s Radwan Force, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike near Nabatieh in Southern Lebanon.

He was also previously responsible for the Radwan Forces' operations during… pic.twitter.com/dAErJzAeQX &mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) October 30, 2024 The IDF emphasized that his removal from the battlefield 'further impairs the Radwan Force’s ability to function and carry out terror activities against IDF forces and the Israeli civilian front along the northern border, specifically its plan to seize the Galilee.' Shakhadi in his previous roles was responsible for Radwan operations during the Syria conflict from 2012 to 2017, and also managed the unit’s combat operations in Southern Lebanon. 'The Radwan Force is Hezbollah’s elite unit, aimed at infiltrating Israeli territory and capturing areas near the northern border,' the military said. 'The IDF will continue to act against Hezbollah terrorists and commanders and to thwart any threat facing Israeli citizens.' IDF issues evacuation orders for Baalbek Residents of Baalbek were reportedly rushing to flee the city, located east of the Litani River in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, following evacuation orders issued by Israel’s military. The IDF was urging civilians in Baalbek and surrounding villages to leave immediately, warning that it was preparing attacks on Hezbollah targets. Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, head of the Arab Media Branch in the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit, tweeted that 'the [Israeli army] will act forcefully against Hezbollah interests within your city and villages.' Evacuation instructions were included in the post and a map was displayed with the evacuation routes. #عاجل إنذار عاجل إلى سكان بعلبك وعين بورضاي ودورسجيش الدفاع سيعمل بقوة ضد مصالح حزب الله داخل مدينتكم وقراكم ولا ينوي المساس بكم.من أجل سلامتكم عليكم اخلاء منازلكم فورًا والانتقال خارج المدينة والقرى عبر المحاور التالية: أوتوستراد زحلة - بعلبكطريق نحلة - بعلبك طريق… pic.twitter.com/1FZoFWqdeO &mdash; افيخاي ادرعي (@AvichayAdraee) October 30, 2024 AFP reported that the main roads out of the city were packed with vehicles, with civil defense vehicles driving around urging civilians to leave immediately. About an hour after the evacuation orders, the city was nearly empty.

PM’s spokesman leaked sensitive intelligence during Iran attack	Dr. Omer Dostri committed a 'serious breach of information security procedures,' a security official said. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leaked sensitive intelligence on the IDF’s aerial attack on Iran while it was ongoing Friday night, Channel 11 reported Tuesday. Dr. Omer Dostri, who came into his position in the Prime Minister’s Office in August, 'publicized footage and revealed details' that constituted 'a serious breach of information security procedures,' said reporter Suleiman Maswadeh. The documentation, a recording of persons involved in the attack, was supposed to first be reviewed by the security authorities so that elements could be blurred and any other necessary changes made. Formal approval of publication also had to be obtained before its release. Neither of these steps were taken, said the reporter, and the clip was publicized widely both by the Israeli and international media. 'Publishing this documentation caused great commotion among the security bodies that were supposed to be responsible for it,' Maswadeh noted. One official told the station that what Dostri did was 'an extremely serious breach' of procedure. The Prime Minister’s Office has yet to respond to a request for comment on the offense. The daring weekend attack in response to Iran's second launch of missiles on Israel saw three waves of IDF jets destroy facilities in Iranian military bases that produced vital ballistic missile components and mixed solid fuel for the missiles, as well as demolishing advanced equipment that it could not manufacture independently. A Saudi Arabian news site, Elaph, cited a source saying that it would take two years for Tehran to rebuild the factory that contained many heavy fuel mixers. The operation also took out many radar systems and most of Iran’s advanced air defenses, including its powerful S-300 systems imported from Russia. Three had remained after the IDF took out one in April in a pinpoint response to Iran’s first attack on Israel with 300 missiles and drones, almost all of which were shot down by the IDF and allies such as the U.S., Great Britain and even Jordan. These guarded a large gas field and the country’s most important petrochemical production complex, as well as Tehran’s international airport, a vital port and a missile base. A Fox News report Tuesday cited U.S. Special Envoy for the Middle East Amos Hochstein as saying on an internal call, 'Iran is essentially naked' now, as it cannot defend itself from an advanced airstrike. Israel therefore has freedom of action in the skies above its biggest strategic enemy, a message made clear by IDF Chief of Staff Lieut. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who warned Iran not to respond because Israel 'know[s] how to strike' and has capabilities it has not even shown yet. Israel refrained this time from attacking Iran’s economic lifeline, its gas and oil fields and production facilities, or its nuclear sites that constitute a strategic threat to Israel’s existence, reportedly due to massive U.S. pressure. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled it out, however, telling the Knesset plenum at its opening session Monday that 'Stopping the Iranian nuclear program is at the forefront of our minds, and for obvious reasons, I cannot share with you all our plans and actions in this regard.'

Netanyahu may postpone son’s wedding due to security concerns	On October 19, a Hezbollah drone made a direct hit on Netanyahu's vacation home in Caesarea. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering postponing his son Avner's wedding in November because of the serious security situation. The wedding was scheduled for November 26 at the Ronit Farm in the Sharon region, north of Tel Aviv. Although Kan quoted the premier as saying privately that the event could put participants at risk, the Prime Minister's Office has not confirmed these remarks. On Monday, Netanyahu expressed concern about drones, specifically since they fly below the radar of missile detection systems. He said, 'We have good detection and interception systems for missiles.' According to the report, The Prime Minister also asked why the Knesset was meeting in its usual location. On October 19, a Hezbollah drone made a direct hit on Netanyahu's vacation home in Caesarea. Neither the Prime Minister nor his wife, Sara were at home at the time of the attack. Following the attempted assassination, security measures for government ministers and other officials have been 'significantly' reinforced. 'Iran tried to eliminate the prime minister of Israel. It will not escape responsibility,' a senior Israeli government official told Ynet. The attack involved three drones, with two intercepted and one directly hitting the bedroom window at the Prime Minister's Caesarea residence. 'The attempt by Iran's proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake,' the prime minister said in a statement following the incident. 'This will not deter me or the State of Israel from continuing our just war against our enemies in order to secure our future. 'I say to Iran and its proxies in its axis of evil: Anyone who tries to harm Israel's citizens will pay a heavy price,' Netanyahu warned. Prior to the attack, drones were observed surveilling the area of the Prime Minister's vacation home. An unmanned aircraft operated by Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon surveilled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence, according to a report preceding the incident.

US team arriving to negotiate Lebanon ceasefire – report	Possible elements of a deal include a serious supervisory mechanism to ensure Hezbollah compliance and a blockade to prevent the terrorist group from rearming. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration’s two top Middle East advisers are coming to Israel to try to negotiate a ceasefire with Hezbollah, Walla reported Wednesday. Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and present an American proposal that could end the fighting in Lebanon 'within weeks,' the news site said, and allow 60,000 residents of the north to return to their homes after a year in limbo since being evacuated for their own safety. According to Walla, they waited until Netanyahu held an hours-long meeting with senior ministers and the heads of Israel’s security bodies Tuesday night to discuss and decide upon the potential parameters of a deal. Israeli officials told the news site that the fact that McGurk and Hochstein are arriving is a sign that the prime minister is ready to move forward on a diplomatic end to the war. The Jerusalem Post cited Wednesday an Israeli source who said that the IDF would not leave southern Lebanon until there is 'an effective solution' to prevent the terror group from reinstating itself on Israel’s border. Israel has repeatedly declared its demand that the binding UN Security Council’s Resolution 1701 that ended the Second Lebanon War in 2006 must finally be fully implemented. This would push Hezbollah forces beyond the Litani River, which for the most part runs several kilometers beyond Israel’s border. This would at least put an effective end to the threat of anti-tank missiles and short-range rockets being fired into northern communities. It would also prevent the construction of sophisticated tunnel networks for an invasion force and the storage of advanced weaponry in Lebanese villages close to the border, which the IDF has found in abundance in recent weeks and blown up. UNSC 1701 envisioned the Lebanese Army taking over the area, although it is not necessarily a more neutral force, because Hezbollah is known to have infiltrated the country's official armed forces. The Post cited a source who said that the American deal now envisions the UN’s peacekeeping force, UNIFIL, in that space, although over the last 18 years UNIFIL did nothing to prevent the Hezbollah build-up on the border or launching rockets, UAVs and other deadly projectiles at Israel. Ynet reported Wednesday that Israel has asked Germany, France and Britain if they would be willing to beef up or maybe replace the current UNIFIL force, perhaps with the thought that those countries would commit more to its official peacekeeping mandate. According to this report, a deal would begin with a 60-day military lull, when 5-10,000 Lebanese army troops would deploy along Israel’s northern border along with UNIFIL, and Hezbollah retreating beyond the Litani. Some kind of supervisory international mechanism is being negotiated as well to ensure compliance, said the report, with Israel demanding the right to re-enter Lebanon if Hezbollah violates the accord. The last element being discussed is how to prevent Hezbollah from rearming, either by land, sea or air. The report said that Russia has expressed willingness to enforce such an embargo, and that Israeli officials are talking to Moscow about the issue. Walla cited unnamed American and Israeli officials as saying that they believe that after the blows the Iranian terror proxy has suffered over the last two months, Hezbollah is finally ready to pursue its own deal with Jerusalem instead of maintaining its stance that it would only stop its attacks when Hamas arranges a ceasefire with Israel. The extremist Shiite organization has lost several thousand fighters in its yearlong confrontation with the IDF, most importantly its entire senior military command and its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, whom the IDF assassinated earlier this month in his underground Beirut compound. It is not toothless yet by any means, as proven by the loss of some two dozen soldiers in southern Lebanon since the IDF incursion began early this month with dozens more injured, some very seriously. In addition, dozens of missiles are still being fired every day, mostly at the north, with one killing a man in Ma’alot-Tarshiha Tuesday and another killing two in the Arab town of Majd al-Krum Friday. Longer range rockets have also reached deeper into Israel, with the Sharon region being targeted Wednesday morning, and shrapnel from at least one missile falling over Haifa. The terrorists are also launching UAVs nearly every day, with the latest one hitting a factory in Nahariya’s industrial zone overnight Wednesday.

Nikki Haley blasts Biden, Harris for funding UNRWA	Policy over personality' - Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, a frequent critic of Donald Trump, explains her endorsement of her former boss. By World Israel News Staff Former South Carolina Governor and 2024 Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley took aim at President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris Tuesday over the administration's reinstatement of funding for a United Nations aid agency accused of links to Hamas and other Gaza terror groups. Haley, who served as United States Ambassador to the United Nations under Donald Trump, was a frequent critic of the former president during her failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination this year, and declined to explicitly endorse him even after she dropped out of the race on March 6th. During the 2024 Republican National Convention in July, however, Haley offered her 'strong endorsement' of Trump, warning against a Harris presidency. On Tuesday, Haley defended her endorsement of Trump despite her past criticisms of her former boss, telling Fox News it is 'more important to support policy over personality,' castigating the Biden administration's handling of the economy and foreign policy. Haley also took to X/Twitter to condemn the White House's policies, warning that should Kamala Harris be elected next week, the U.S. would face even greater consequences. Among the policies Haley took issue with was the decision by the Biden administration to restore American funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), amid accusations the agency ignored the involvement of some of its employees with terrorist groups including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and claims UNRWA turned a blind eye to the misuse of its funds and facilities. UNRWA has also faced criticism for the anti-Israel and antisemitic incitement in textbooks used by schools operated by the agency. 'We knew long before Oct. 7 that UNRWA spread anti-Israel and antisemitic hate,' Haley wrote. 'That's why the U.S. stopped giving them hundreds of millions of dollars when I was at the UN.' 'Biden-Harris gave the money back, no strings attached. America and Israel will suffer the consequences if Kamala Harris is elected.' In 2018, then-President Donald Trump suspended funding for UNRWA. The U.S. had previously been spending some $360 million annually on the agency, making American UNRWA's largest donor. In 2021, however, just months after taking office, President Biden resumed funding UNRWA to the tune of roughly $150 million per year. Following revelations that some UNRWA employees took part in the invasion of Israel on October 7th and subsequent atrocities, President Biden froze funding for UNRWA, starting in January 2024. Two months later, Congress passed legislation barring direct funding for UNRWA until MArch 2025.

‘A noble life’ – Fallen soldier leaves behind pregnant wife	Yedidia Bloch, 32, is survived by his wife, parents, and seven siblings. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli reservist seriously hurt in battle last week died on Tuesday, leaving behind a wife who is eight months pregnant with their first child. Master Sergeant Yedidia Bloch, a resident of Mevo Horon in the Binyamin region, died of wounds sustained during fighting in southern Lebanon after clinging to life for six days. Bloch, 32, served in the 7155th Battalion. He is survived by his wife, Sapir, parents, seven brothers and sisters, and many nieces and nephews. 'For the past few days we have been praying for our dear friend. He went into battle with great dedication. He fought and died for the people of Israel and for our complete victory,' said Binyamin Regional Council head Israel Ganz. 'At this time, we embrace his wife Sapir, as well as his parents and siblings and send strength to the community of Mevo Horon. Thanks to Yedidia, the people of Israel will overcome and win.' 'Someone asked me today what the name Yedidia means - and it is enough to see the light on your face to feel your friendship. Our beloved nephew and hero, the light of his eyes, the light of his heart,' Yedidia's aunt, Naomi, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'He was a devoted friend, with a big heart and always ready to help others, and a figure admired by all his nephews and nieces,' another family member said. Bloch 'was such a handsome man, blond, tall, with bright eyes. A light-hearted, funny guy and a smiling and happy person, and just as beautiful on the inside' as outside, wrote his friend Omri on Facebook. 'Yedidia Bloch, you are the beautiful Israeli. This is how I will remember you as a man and a dear friend, a man of giving, laughter and true love. I will tell your child about you as soon as he grows up - so that he knows what a special and kind man his father was.'

‘We may need to hit Iran again, including new targets’ – IDF Chie...	The IDF did not launch a no-holds-barred attack on Iran because 'we may be required to do it again,' says IDF chief. By World Israel News Staff Israel may launch an additional strike against Iran, which would include fresh targets not included in the first round of attacks, Israeli army Chief of Staff Herzi HaLevi said on Tuesday. If Tehran 'makes the mistake and launches another barrage of missiles at Israel, we will once again know how to reach Iran,' HaLevi said while touring the Ramon Air Force Base in southern Israel. In the event of continued Iranian aggression, Israel will 'reach Iran, with capabilities that we did not even use this time, and hit extremely hard both the capabilities and the places that we spared this time,' he continued. The IDF chief acknowledged criticism that Saturday's attack - which came after a massive ballistic missile assault on Israel launched by Iran on October 1 - had not sufficiently deterred the Islamic Republic. The military did not launch a no-holds-barred attack on Iran because 'we may be required to do it again,' he said. 'We didn’t finish this event, we are right in the middle of it,' he added. HaLevi's remarks come after reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet discussed plans for a potential second attack on Iran for more than six hours, though ultimately did not come to a decision on the matter. In Saturday's attack, Israel struck missile and drone manufacturing sites, but appeared to cave to heavy pressure from the U.S. to avoid striking Iran's nuclear development program and oil assets. However, cabinet members reportedly said that the attack was a response solely to Iran's ballistic missile attack - and did not constitute a sufficient response to the drone strike on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Caesarea residence earlier in October. Despite public threats by Iranian officials to 'punish' Israel for the recent strike, Israel believes that Tehran is not gearing up for a counter-attack on Israel in the near future.

At ‘emergency session’ on Israel’s attack on Iran, UN Security Co...	The Israeli envoy told the Security Council to impose 'crippling sanctions' on Iran’s military and economic infrastructure. By Mike Wagenheim, JNS Iran will suffer 'severe consequences' if the Islamic Republic continues to attack Israel or U.S. troops across the Middle East, Washington said during a contentious U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday afternoon. The emergency session—which Algeria, China and Russia called—addressed the impact of Israel’s retaliatory attacks on Iranian military targets over the weekend, in response to Tehran’s barrage of some 200 ballistic missiles on Israel earlier in the month. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the global body, told the Security Council that Washington, which doesn’t want to see further escalation, believes 'this should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran.' But the United States 'will not hesitate to act in self-defense,' she said. Iran accused the Biden administration of complicity in Israel’s weekend assault, which reportedly degraded Tehran’s missile production capabilities significantly. Washington has said many times that it played no role in the Israeli operation. Iran 'seeks to gaslight and deflect, to claim the role of victim, while continuing to sow chaos across the region,' Thomas-Greenfield said. She demanded that Tehran 'stop pouring gasoline on the fire of regional conflict.' Danny Danon, the Israeli U.N. ambassador, reminded the council that Jerusalem 'promised' that Iran’s direct attack on Israel—its second in five months—'would not go unanswered.' 'We assured them that we would choose the time and manner of our response, and that it would be painful,' Danon said. 'Those promises are being kept.' Danon stressed that the precise military targeting of the attack on Iran was meant to inflict minimal civilian damage. The Security Council’s 'usual chorus of ‘de-escalation’ is not only weak, but profoundly misguided,' he said and results in 'failure to impose real cost' on the Iranian regime. The Israeli envoy told the Security Council to impose 'crippling sanctions' on Iran’s military and economic infrastructure and issued a 'warning' to Iranian leadership that 'any further aggression will be met with consequences that are swift and decisive.' Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s U.N. ambassador, said that the Islamic Republic has the 'inherent right to respond at a time of its choosing to this act of aggression.' ‘More fuel on the flames’ Iravani stated that the Oct. 1 attack on Israel was retaliation for the assassinations of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps general Abbas Nilforoushan in Beirut, as well as Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Hezbollah and Hamas are among Iran’s terrorist proxies, receiving training and funding from Tehran. Iravani called Israel’s assassinations of terror leaders 'part of a broader, sustained pattern of aggression and unchecked impunity with which Israel continues to destabilize the entire region.' Much of the rest of the Security Council was split along traditional fault lines. Barbara Woodward, the United Kingdom’s U.N. envoy, called for Iran to stand down, saying 'all sides must exercise restraint. No good can come of pouring more fuel on the flames of this escalating cycle of violence.' Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian U.N. ambassador, took shots at both Israel and the United States. 'Jerusalem is not ready to give up on its choice to resolve all of its conflict situations with neighbors exclusively by force,' Nebenzia said, claiming that Israel’s 'determination to act that way' is due to 'the support and cover from American allies.' Fu Cong, China’s U.N. ambassador, told the United States 'to put saving lives and preventing war' first, by backing the calls of other Security Council members for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and ramping down fighting between Israel and Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border. Abbas Kadhim Obaid, the Iraqi envoy to the United Nations, condemned Israel’s unauthorized use of Iraqi airspace to strike Iran. Baghdad sent a missive earlier in the day to the Security Council complaining about what it said was a violation of its sovereignty. The Security Council will meet again on Tuesday for its quarterly open debate on the Israeli-Palestinian file.

Mandela’s pro-Hamas grandson rages after UK visa denied	Mandla Mandela's presence in the UK would pose a threat to Jewish communities, society, says UK border ministry. By World Israel News Staff Nelson Mandela's grandson, who has repeatedly praised Hamas and Hezbollah, posted an angry tirade on his Instagram account after he was denied a visa to travel to the UK due to his support for terrorism. Mandla Mandela was slated to speak at several pro-Palestinian rallies in cities throughout the UK, including Manchester, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. But the UK Home Office denied a visa to Mandela, explaining in a letter that the decision was due to his pro-terror posts on Instagram. The letter highlighted several posts lauding Hamas made by Mandela on the account. 'Your presence in the UK is considered to pose a threat to UK society as it would highly likely cause tensions amongst UK Jewish communities,' the Home Office said. It is in the interests of the community to refuse your visa to protect public safety and prevent disorder or crime in the UK.' An enraged Mandela took to his Instagram account, claiming that the UK government is guilty of 'duplicity and support for, and complicity with genocide Israel.' Mandela then conflated the anti-Israel movement, which has seen Jews verbally and physically assaulted on college campuses and city streets, to the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. 'We will not be silenced. The denial of visa is an infringement of my movement and an attempt to undermine the work of the Anti-Apartheid Movement in the UK,' he wrote, alleging that the decision was indicative of the 'colonial mentality that seeks to deny us our right of free movement, association and speech.' He then compared himself to his grandfather, who is widely viewed as a hero in South Africa for his critical role in overturning the apartehid system in the country. Mandela said he carries 'this legacy with pride' and will 'fight inequality, domination, occupation and inequality wherever it raises its ugly head. We will continue to stand with the oppressed of the world wherever they may be. We will never abandon the Palestinian people who stood with us in our darkest hour,' he added.

Hezbollah use Western Union and Whish to fund their terrorist act...	Israel uncovered Western Union's role as a vehicle for terrorism funding in 2017 when it exposed the 'equip a mujahid' campaign. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A campaign to raise funds to arm Hezbollah terrorists used Western Union and the money transfer platform Whish to secure money for the terror group. The campaign was featured on the Qatari website Al-Araby Al-Jadid (The New Arab) with ads that said, 'Lift your head high to the sky, and see where your support is,' referring to Hezbollah's aerial weapons. Readers are urged to donate money to the Islamic Resistance Support Organization (IRSO), which the US has designated as a terror group since 2006. The IRSO holds a number of accounts in Al-Qard al-Hassan (AQAH), which is Hezbollah's pseudo-banking system that the IDF targeted. According to the Jerusalem Post, the IRSO is asking donors to give money through Western Union and Whish (formerly WOO cash) as an alternative method of funding. Whish has 900 branches across Lebanon and is owned by Syrian nationals. According to its website, Whish offers domestic and international financial solutions, including money transfer services, currency exchange, e-wallets, and investments. Israel uncovered Western Union's role as a vehicle for terrorism funding in 2017 when it exposed the 'equip a mujahid' campaign. In response to questions about its platform being used to channel money to terrorists, Western Union said in a statement, 'We take our regulatory and compliance responsibilities very seriously, including our role in the fight against terrorist financing. To that effect, we have programs in place that screen Western Union transactions against internal and government watch lists.' Western Union added, 'Our internal Financial Intelligence Unit pursues intelligence leads and analysis about a broad range of global terror groups. We remain committed to working closely with governments and law enforcement authorities to continue addressing terrorist financing activities.' Whish Money cooperates with several companies across the globe, including Mastercard, US-based Ria Money Transfer and Sendwave, and UK-based Shift Transfer.

Israeli forces nab ISIS terrorist in Umm al-Fahm	Last week, seven Arabs from Jerusalem were arrested by security forces on suspicion of plotting to murder scientists and officials on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran. By JNS Israeli security forces earlier this month arrested an Arab national who swore allegiance to ISIS and had plans to carry out terror attacks in the Jewish state, the Israel Police and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) announced on Tuesday. The Arab suspect, identified by the Israel Police as 19-year-old Abed al-Rahman Mahajna from Umm al-Fahm in central Israel, was charged on Tuesday after being taken into custody approximately three weeks ago. According to authorities, Mahajna declared his allegiance to the terror organization in recent months and was involved in Arab riots during the Israel Defense Forces’ 'Operation Guardian of the Walls' in May 2021. During the arrest raid, security forces discovered documents with instructions on how to produce bombs, as well as a will he had prepared about a year ago in which he expressed his desire to become a 'martyr.' 'This incident joins the series of arrests made against Israeli citizens who planned to carry out terrorist activities in Israel,' an unnamed ISA official told local media, adding that 'the trend in which Israeli citizens are involved in terrorism and espionage is extremely serious, and security will act hard against those involved.' Last week, seven Arabs from Jerusalem were arrested by security forces on suspicion of plotting to murder scientists and officials on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The suspects, from the neighborhood of Beit Safafa in the eastern part of the Jewish state’s capital, were allegedly asked by Tehran to kill a nuclear scientist and the mayor of a large city. In August, Israeli forces dismantled an Arab-Israeli terrorist squad that had detailed plans to carry out a combined shooting and bombing in the Galilee region, the country’s security agencies revealed on Sept. 26. The cell, which was led by a resident of the town of Arraba in the Galilee and also included Palestinians from Judea and Samaria, was detained on Aug. 12, according to the Israel Police and ISA. Five months earlier, authorities nabbed 13 Arabs from northern Israel who were said to have been planning terrorist attacks on behalf of Hamas. The suspects, most of them residents of Sakhnin in the Lower Galilee, purchased weapons from terrorists in Judea and Samaria. One-third of Israel’s 2.095 million Arab citizens believe that Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre of primarily Jewish civilians is in line with Arab, Palestinian and Islamic values, according to a December 2023 poll.

Israel expects disabled soldier numbers to reach 100,000 by 2030	Approximately 14% of the wounded are classified as having moderate to severe injuries. By Pesach Benson, TPS Around 12,000 injured Israeli soldiers and security personnel have entered phyiscal rehabilitation since the October 7, 2023, according to figures released by the Defense Ministry on Tuesday. The ministry said this increase has led to a 20% rise in patient numbers over the past year, reaching nearly 74,000 individuals. Of these, about 1,500 have sustained injuries on two separate occasions during the fighting. Since the recent ground operation in Lebanon began, around 900 newly wounded soldiers have been evacuated to hospitals, marking a 1.5-fold increase in admissions compared to September. Young adults ages 18-30 represent 51% of all cases, with roughly 8,500 sustaining physical injuries. In addition, 5,200 individuals, or 43%, have developed mental health conditions due to the trauma of combat. According to ministry figures, two-thirds of the rehabilitating soldiers are reservists. Approximately 14% of the wounded are classified as having moderate to severe injuries, with 23 cases of serious head trauma, 60 amputees who now have prosthetics — including five who received fittings abroad — and 12 individuals who lost their sight. The Israel Defense Force’s Rehabilitation Division was already treating 62,000 injured soldiers from previous conflicts. The ministry anticipates that by 2030, the number of disabled IDF members could reach 100,000, with half of these cases involving mental health challenges. To meet the wartime need, the Defense Minstry has hired 500 therapists, established 10 rehabilitation farms, opened three specialized rehabilitation homes, and introduced emergency vehicles for immediate psychological aid. Since the October 7 attack, 776 soldiers have been killed, most recently four in northern Gaza from the IDF’s special forces 'Ghost Unit' on Tuesday. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hezbollah names Naim Qassem as new leader, Israel says he won’t l...	He is considered by many in Lebanon to lack the charisma and gravitas of Nasrallah. By Reuters and The Algemeiner The Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah named Naim Qassem as its new leader on Tuesday but Israel said his tenure would be 'temporary,' an apparent threat after it killed his predecessor Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut over a month ago. 'Temporary appointment. Not for long,' Israel‘s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant posted on X/Twitter with a photo of Qassem. Earlier, Iran-backed Hezbollah said in a written statement that its Shura Council had elected Qassem, 71, in accordance with its established mechanism for choosing a secretary general. Qassem was appointed as Hezbollah‘s deputy chief in 1991 by the armed group’s then-secretary general Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed by an Israeli helicopter attack the following year. Qassem remained in his role when Nasrallah became leader, and has long been one of Hezbollah‘s leading spokesmen, conducting interviews with foreign media, including while cross-border hostilities with Israel raged over the last year. Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27 in an Israeli air attack on Beirut’s southern suburbs, known as Dahiyeh, and senior Hezbollah figure Hashem Safieddine — considered the most likely successor — was killed in Israeli strikes a week later. Since Nasrallah’s killing, Qassem has given three televised addresses, including one on Oct. 8 in which he said the terrorist group supported efforts to reach a ceasefire for Lebanon. He is considered by many in Lebanon to lack the charisma and gravitas of Nasrallah. In its official Arabic account on X, the Israeli government said: 'His tenure in this position may be the shortest in the history of this terrorist organization if he follows in the footsteps of his predecessors Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine.' 'There is no solution in Lebanon except to dismantle this organization as a military force,' it wrote.

Knesset bans UNRWA, outlaws all official contact	The legislation, which the U.S. and E.U. oppose, follows revelations about the U.N. agency's complicity in Palestinian terrorism. By Canaan Lidor, Amelie Botbol, JNS Israel’s Knesset on Monday made it illegal for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to operate in Israeli territory, and for state officials to cooperate with the agency. The two laws were passed by a large majority following the exposure of UNRWA staff complicity in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, and despite pressure from the United States and other countries against the move. The Biden Administration was 'deeply concerned' about the legislation, according to an unnamed U.S. State Department official cited by Axios. This echoes language used by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken prior to the vote. Josep Borrell, the E.U. High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, tweeted that the new laws 'would de facto render UNRWA’s vital operations in Gaza impossible, and seriously hamper its provision of services in the West Bank.' The laws stand 'in stark contradiction to international law and the fundamental principle of humanity,' he added. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini tweeted that the legislation 'opposes the U.N. Charter and violates the State of Israel’s obligations under international law.' However, experts on UNRWA, including former Israeli lawmaker Einat Wilf, who has written an acclaimed book about the agency, dispute that the legislation contradicts international law. Israel is not party to any treaty compelling it to engage with the group or allow its activities, Wilf told JNS. Israeli Sanctions on UNRWA The two laws are by far the most robust parliamentary push by Israel against UNRWA, the largest donors of which are the United States and the European Union. The agency has for decades has been accused of providing cover and income to Palestinian terrorists while undermining peace efforts. The law that bans UNRWA activity on Israeli territory, authored by Knesset member Boaz Bismuth (Likud) and six other coalition lawmakers, was passed by a majority of 87 of the Knesset’s 120 lawmakers. Nine MKs present voted against the law, one did not vote. The remaining 23 lawmakers were not present for the vote. 'UNRWA—United Nations Relief and Works Agency will operate no representation, provide no service or hold any activity, directly or indirectly, in the sovereign territory of the State of Israel,' the law co authored by Bismuth states. The second law, passed by 92-10, states: 'No state authority, including entities and individuals who legally hold public office, will engage in any contact with UNRWA or its representatives.' This legislation was coauthored by MKs Yulia Malinovsky (Yisrael Beiteinu), Dan Illouz (Likud) and Ron Katz (Yesh Atid). 'UNRWA will not operate in Israel, their benefits will be canceled, their entry to Israel will be banned. Total Disconnect,' Malinovsky tweeted following the votes. According to its website, UNRWA employs some 30,000 staff, most of them Palestinians, including 13,000 in the Gaza Strip. It also has staff in Judea and Samaria and eastern Jerusalem. UNRWA also operates in Jordan and Lebanon. Being banned in Israel could end UNRWA’s work in Jerusalem and greatly complicate its operations in Gaza and Judea and Samaria, where the organization is at least partially dependent on Israeli cooperation. UNRWA's Links to Hamas In the wake of the Oct. 7 massacres in Israel, in which Hamas terrorists murdered some 1,200 people and abducted another 251, evidence surfaced about the complicity of UNRWA staff in those atrocities and other acts of terrorism. For example, UNRWA worker Faisal Ali Mussalem al-Naami and a colleague were captured on video loading the body of Israeli Yonatan Samerano into a vehicle in Sderot. According to Israel, over 450 terrorists belonging to terrorist organizations in Gaza, mainly Hamas, are also employed by UNRWA. UNRWA’s Lazzarini has flatly denied these allegations. On Sept. 29, Hamas admitted that Fatah Sharif Abu al-Amin, chairman of UNRWA’s Teachers’ Association, was its commander in Lebanon. The agency had suspended Abu al-Amin in March, yet after his death denied knowing he was involved in terrorism. UNRWA-employed Arabic teacher Yusef Zidan Suleiman al-Hawajara was recorded bragging to a friend on Oct. 7 about capturing a female hostage. ('We have female hostages, I captured one!' he says in a recording released by the IDF.) In July, Israel’s foreign ministry published a list of names and ID numbers of 108 UNRWA employees Israel accuses of being Hamas terrorists. It was a 'small fraction,' a Foreign Ministry official wrote, of a much larger list including hundreds of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members who also worked for UNRWA. The wider list could not be released due to security considerations. On Oct. 13, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin sent a letter about the agency to Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Defense Minister Yoav Galant. In the letter, which demanded Israel increase the amount of aid being let into the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, they noted that they were 'deeply concerned' about the Knesset bills. An Uncertain Future UNRWA had a budget of about $1.1 billion in 2023. Eighteen countries suspended funding to UNRWA following the Oct. 7 attack, including the United States, which provides roughly a third of the organization’s budget. The United States froze its donations to UNRWA until March 2025. Only it and New Zealand have not yet reinstated their funding. As of Tuesday morning, it was unclear how donor countries would respond to the Israeli move. 'We will have to look at how UNRWA donors respond. In the past week, they have been threatening Israel to not take this move, but it will be interesting to see whether or not they enforce Israel’s decision,' Anne Herzberg, legal adviser at the Jerusalem-based NGO Monitor organization, told JNS on Tuesday. According to Herzberg, while the Israeli move is a blow to UNRWA, it will not end the agency. 'While Israel can prevent UNRWA from operating on its own territory, they can’t block the organization from operating in Lebanon, Jordan or other countries,' she noted. 'In my opinion this move won’t be the end of UNRWA, but I would hope that responsible governments such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom or Germany take this as an opportunity to engage in significant investigations,' she added. While it has been obvious for years that Hamas is stealing money from UNRWA and using its installations, the organization has refused to put safeguards in place, she said, emphasizing that the agency itself is to blame for the Israeli move. 'If UNRWA indeed plays such a vital role, then the international community must implement reforms as well as bring criminal charges not only against UNRWA employees who participated in Oct. 7 but also officials who not only allowed Hamas to exploit UNRWA’s facilities and money but looked the other way,' she told JNS. 'In addition to UNRWA there are another 13 U.N. agencies operating in Gaza and 23 in Judea and Samaria; there are other actors who could step in to fill the role that UNRWA has been playing,' she continued. 'It’s not so much about getting the humanitarian aid in, it’s really about what is being done to protect that system in Gaza with Hamas in control, and rather than trying to find solutions, the United Nations and other aid organizations tried relaxing or even eliminating vetting processes,' she added. Through UNRWA, the United Nations employs a unique refugee definition to Palestinians. The agency defines as refugees not only those who fled the 1948 war, but their descendants in perpetuity until a 'just solution' emerges for their status. The United Nations employs a different definition for all other refugees, who cannot pass the title to their descendants and often lose it when they are naturalized elsewhere. This has perpetuated the Israeli-Palestinian conflict according to many critics, including Hillel Neuer, the founder of U.N. Watch. 'What the Knesset did yesterday is extremely significant,' Neuer told JNS on Tuesday, though he too said that the new legislation would not close UNRWA down. 'The legislation will require closing UNRWA’s facilities in Jerusalem. Israeli officials are barred from dealing with UNRWA representatives operating in the West Bank and Gaza, it will make UNRWA’s operations more difficult, I don’t think it will necessarily close them,' he said. However, he added, the move by Israel had a greater significance. 'Beyond the concrete consequences, a very important message was sent, which is ‘no more,’' he said. 'No more will Israel tolerate an agency that has a pathological agenda. The aim of UNRWA is not distributing aid, it is teaching Palestinians that they will dismantle Israel,' he continued. 'Terrorists factions say openly that UNRWA is witness to the injustice they suffered. They want to undo this injustice, and Oct. 7 is the continuation of UNRWA. The message of UNRWA is to encourage Oct. 7,' he said. Neuer explained that back in 2011, UNRWA knew that the head of its teachers’ union in Gaza, Suhail al-Hindi, was a Hamas official and did nothing. 'They allowed him to be the head of the teachers union, he was elected to the Hamas politburo in Gaza. Eventually in 2017 he was asked to resign and go away quietly. When they were pressured to suspend him, 8,000 teachers in Gaza rallied and shut UNRWA down for three months off and on,' Neuer said. With regard to Lebanon, 'UNRWA knows that its staff supports Hamas in Lebanon,' he added. 'We sent information that the head of their teachers’ union in Lebanon was a Hamas official. Israel eliminated him last month. Last week, Israel eliminated an UNRWA truck driver and he was the head of the Hamas terrorist squad that on Oct. 7 assaulted [the Kibbutz] Re’im bomb shelter,' he continued. 'If this were a normal agency, the head of the agency would resign,' he added. As for what comes next, there is still some uncertainty, he said. 'Immediately, there is no direct impact to UNRWA in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. The direct effect is on UNRWA in Jerusalem. Israel will have to think about the schools and facilities and provide alternatives. Israel already provides all governmental service to Arabs in eastern Jerusalem and there is no reason why they can’t do the same for Shuafat,' he continued. 'The more complicated thing is the prohibition on dealing with UNRWA in Gaza and Judea and Samaria. It is not clear what will happen next, it’s not entirely clear. There will be a few months for the law to go into effect and there will be a lot of pressure on Israel to somehow freeze the law. I don’t think Israel should surrender,' he said. 'The important thing to remember is that Palestinians are prisoners of assistance that keeps them in permanent dependency. UNRWA dooms Palestinians to a cycle of dependency. It calls itself an aid agency but it is a Palestinian war agency. The whole point of UNRWA is to tell Palestinians that their future is to dismantle Israel,' he concluded.

Four soldiers killed in Gaza, bringing IDF toll to 776	On Monday, an IDF soldier wounded in the northern Strip earlier this month succumbed to his wounds. By JNS Four more Israel Defense Forces soldiers were killed fighting Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip, the military announced on Tuesday afternoon. They were identified as Cpt. Yehonatan Joni Keren, 22, from Moledet; Staff Sgt. Nisim Meytal, 20, from Hadera; Staff Sgt. Aviv Gilboa, 21, from Neve Tzuf; and Staff Sgt. Naor Haimov, 22, from Rosh Ha’ayin. All four served in the IDF’s elite Multidimensional Unit. An officer in the unit was seriously wounded in the incident that killed the four. On Monday, an IDF soldier wounded in the northern Strip earlier this month succumbed to his wounds, the army announced. Maj. Guy Yaacov Nezri, 25, of the 401st Armored Brigade’s 52nd Battalion, from Atlit, was seriously hurt in Jabalia on Oct. 19. The IDF death toll in Gaza since the start of the ground operation there on Oct. 27, 2023, stands at 365, while the figure on all fronts since Oct. 7, 2023 is 776. Additionally, Ch. Insp. Arnon Zamora, a member of the Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded in the Strip in May.

IDF declares military victory in south Lebanon, calls for negotia...	Israel's military has achieved its goals against the Hezbollah terror organization in southern Lebanon, according to report, paving the way for a possible truce to end the conflict. By World Israel News Staff Israel has achieved all of its military goals in southern Lebanon and is now in a position to reach a negotiated settlement ending the current conflict with the Hezbollah terror organization, Walla News reported Tuesday. The IDF was deployed to southern Lebanon beginning on October 1st, with the goal of dismantling Hezbollah's terrorist infrastructure in the area of the Israel-Lebanon frontier and pushing the terrorist group away from Israel's border, thus neutralizing its ability to target Israeli border towns. The Israeli military has now achieved those goals, the IDF's Northern Command has determined, according to the report by Walla, that most of Hezbollah's infrastructure along the Israeli border has been destroyed. In addition, most of the Iranian-backed terror group's weapons in the border zone have either been destroyed or captured, the report claimed, citing the Northern Command. While the border area has largely been cleared of Hezbollah, the army reportedly acknowledged that some villages in southern Lebanon must still be operated in, with the army waiting on the Shin Bet intelligence agency to complete its work. Nevertheless, despite some remaining operations required in specific villages, the report claimed that the Israeli military has determined that the government is now in a position to begin negotiations with Hezbollah to reach a truce ending the current conflict. Should the Israeli government not pursue or should it fail to achieve a ceasefire in southern Lebanon enabling the IDF to withdraw, the military predicts that one of two possible scenarios will occur. Either the status quo will continue, with the IDF enhancing its military pressure on Hezbollah, or Israel will consolidate its control over parts southern Lebanon.

Poll: Israelis back Trump over Harris by 4-to-1 margin	Just one out of six Israelis say they hope Vice President Kamala Harris win's next week's presidential election. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News With just one week to go before election day in the United States, polls show a virtual dead-heat between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, both in national polling and in the seven battle-ground states that are expected to determine the outcome of the election. But while Americans appear to be nearly evenly divided ahead of the election, the vast majority of Israelis say they prefer Trump to win, according to a new poll. The survey, conducted by the Midgam polling agency on Monday via telephone and internet, was published by Israel's Channel 12 on Tuesday morning. The poll, which included 507 adult Israeli respondents, found that nearly two-thirds (66%) of Israeli Jews and Arabs say they prefer to see Trump in the White House, rather than Harris. Just 17% of Israelis said they hope Harris wins next Tuesday's election. A similar percentage said they had no opinion regarding the election. Among Israelis who said they voted in the previous election for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, 93% said they favor a second Trump term, compared to just 1% who said they hope to see Harris win next week's election. Tuesday's poll also found that more than half (57%) of Israelis say they were satisfied with Israel's response over the weekend to Iran's October 1st ballistic missile attack on Israel. By comparison, 32% said they were dissatisfied with Israel's retaliatory strikes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the candidate of choice for a plurality of Israelis, according to the poll, including in a head-to-head matchup against former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who has led Netanyahu in previous polls. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said they preferred Netanyahu as premier over Bennett, compared to 35% who said they would prefer Bennett as premier. Netanyahu led former Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Opposition Leader Yair Lapid by wider margins.

600 Hamas terrorists surrender in northern Gaza	Among those who surrendered are terrorists who participated in the October 7 massacres. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Six hundred terrorists have surrendered and been captured so far in Jabalia after the IDF cut off the northern Gazan region several weeks ago where the so-called refugee camp is located. Some 120 were taken in a raid over the weekend of the local hospital that Hamas was using as a primary command-and-control center. About 20 terrorists were killed and 60 captured in the IDF foray into the Kamal Adwan Hospital. Another 60 were found hiding among the patients, along with cash, documents and weaponry that had been stashed throughout the medical complex. The IDF publicized clips from an interrogation of a paramedic from the hospital, who said that Hamas fighters were everywhere in what was legally a protected space for civilians. 'Hamas military operatives are present. They are in the courtyards, at the gates of the buildings, in the offices,' he said. 'They operate ambulances to transport their wounded military operatives and to transport them for their missions,' he continued. 'This is instead of using the ambulances for the benefit of civilians.' Some of those seized had been among the forces that invaded Israel last October in the surprise attack in which mainly Hamas terrorists massacred 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians. 'The surprise for Hamas was complete,' the IDF said regarding the operation. 'We trapped hundreds of terrorists inside the camp, including senior operatives.' Prior to the raid, as the hospital was also acting as a treatment center, the IDF had allowed it to continue its emergency care of civilians and helped supply the emergency systems as well. Three IDF brigades, including armored brigades, had essentially cut off the northern Gaza Strip in recent weeks after finding out that those Hamas operatives who remained in the area were regrouping, for the most part in Jabalia . The army ordered residents to evacuate to the south, and some 50,000 fled through humanitarian corridors the army set up. Soldiers looked for and arrested suspected Hamas fighters among the refugees. The terrorists attempted to stop civilians from fleeing, army sources said, even shooting some people in the legs to deter their human shields from leaving. 'In the last week,' they said, 'the fear barrier of Hamas was broken.' Most of the residents, they added, went no further south than Gaza City. While one brigade has now been transferred elsewhere, two remain for mop-up operations, as there are still an estimated several hundred Hamas fighters left in the camp. The army said that their enemy’s tactics have devolved into guerilla warfare, with the terrorists making more use of IEDs rather than fighting IDF troops head-on. 'These are not the battalions and companies we saw at the beginning of the fighting a year ago. They are on the verge of breaking. Their combat capability is significantly lower. In the first round, we didn’t see 600 terrorists surrendering,' the IDF stated.

Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather pays solidarity visit to wounded I...	Floyd Mayweather Jr., ranked as one of the greatest professional boxers in history, pays a solidarity visit to Israel, meeting with IDF soldiers wounded during the ongoing war against Hamas and Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff American boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. paid a visit to Israel this week, marking his fourth trip to the country since the October 7th invasion. During his trip, Mayweather visited Belev Echad’s rehabilitation center in Kiryat Ono, Israel, to meet with and offer his support to Israeli soldiers who were wounded during the recent conflict. Mayweather, widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, retired with an undefeated record of 50-0. Known for his extraordinary defensive skills, speed, and strategic prowess in the ring, Mayweather has won world titles in five different weight classes over his career. Beyond his athletic achievements, he has also become a prominent figure for his philanthropic endeavors, lending his support to various causes worldwide. During the visit in Kiryat Ono, Mayweather expressed admiration and solidarity with the injured soldiers. 'I'm happy to be here. I see so many bright faces, so many beautiful people. You guys are brave warriors. I take my hat off to everyone in here that goes on that battlefield.' 'Everyone can do your job, just like everyone can do my job. We all got to be team players. You guys are team players. I'm proud of you all. Hold your head up high and just know every day is a blessing. We can't take anything for granted. You guys are true heroes, warriors, and I'm behind you 100%. I'll be back, and you guys have my support.' Moti Fried, who accompanied Mayweather on his visit in Israel, remarked on the dedication of the boxing icon. 'It's simply unbelievable that he drops everything and comes here for the fourth time. He’s a legend in his field, and his love for Israel and the Jewish people is something truly exceptional.' Rabbi Uriel and Shevy Vigler, founders of Belev Echad, expressed their deep appreciation for Mayweather’s visit. 'Floyd’s support and compassion mean the world to these soldiers,' said Rabbi Vigler. 'His visit lifts their spirits and reminds them that people across the globe are standing with them.' Shevy Vigler added, 'Floyd’s connection to our soldiers speaks volumes. His presence here brings hope and a renewed sense of strength to those who have sacrificed so much for Israel.'

5,000-year-old town discovered west of Jerusalem	Archeologists unearth 5,000-year-old town outside of Beit Shemesh, shedding light on the early urbanization of the region. By World Israel News Staff A 5,000-year-old settlement, which provides a view of the beginning of the urbanization process in the Levant, was discovered in the Israel Antiquities Authority excavations near Beit Shemesh at the site of Hurvat Husham. The excavations took place in preparation for the expansion of the city’s western industrial zone, 'Brosh', at the initiative of the Shamir Engineering Group and the Bet Shemesh Economic Development Company. The excavation revealed, among other things, a public building that may have been used for ritual activity, and in it a room with about 40 vessels preserved intact. Among them were also many tiny vessels, whose size suggests they were not for domestic use, but rather had a mainly symbolic purpose. The vessels were preserved in their original place – just as they were placed by the people living there in the Early Bronze Age IB (end of the 4th millennium BCE). 'It is interesting that these many pots and juglets were placed here just shortly before the entire site was abandoned forever,' said Ariel Shatil, Maayan Hamed and Danny Benayoun, the Israel Antiquities Authority excavation directors. 'You can literally imagine the people who put down this ware and left it all here. It is not known what happened in this room later, but there are signs of burning, and vessels that fell on top of each other.' 'Laboratory examination of their former contents of the vessels using different scientific methods will shed additional light on the site: We will be able to tell if they contained oil, water, wheat – or perhaps they were specifically for exotic oils or other substances.' 'The size of this structure that we uncovered, its broad walls, the benches inside it and other variables indicate that it is an important and exceptional structure with a public function – perhaps a temple,' say the excavation managers. 'We know almost no public buildings in Israel from this ancient period and earlier,' say the researchers. 'Comparison with the few known buildings of this type produces the conclusion that this is probably one of the earliest temples ever discovered in the Judean Lowlands.' Near the public building, a complex was discovered with large standing stones arranged in rows. 'The standing stones were erected even before this enclosed public building was erected. Their presence promises to be instructive of the socio-political process involved in the founding of the cultic service in Hurvat Husham – it seems that originally there was an open cultic activity area for the general public which then transformed into ritual activity in an enclosed compound with more controlled access.' 'This development process on the site, along with other processes, attests to an increase in social complexity,' says Dr. Yitzhak Paz, Early Bronze Age expert at the Israel Antiquities Authority. 'This is one of the indicators of urbanization development in Israel during the Early Bronze Age. Two kilns for pottery manufacture were also discovered at the site, from the earliest ever discovered in Israel.' The ancient settlement in Hurvat Husham was first discovered in 2021, in excavations conducted by Marion Zindel and Natan Ben-Ari on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. In the last three-and-a-half years the excavation was expanded which clarified the extent of the site and its importance for understanding the origins of the urbanization process in Israel. The Early Bronze Age is one of the most complex periods in Israel's history, during which dramatic changes took place in the lifestyle and worldview of the region’s inhabitants. The number of people who lived in Israel increased dramatically. For the first time social complexity was created, as well as the political structure of a hierarchical society. At the peak of the period, the acceleration of the urbanization phenomenon is evident, and monumental public construction can already be seen –fortifications, religious and government buildings, expertise and standardization in various industries, and more intensive trade with neighboring regions such as Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia. 'The site uncovered in Hurvat Husham is exceptional not only because of its size, but because it reveals to us some of the first characteristics of the transition from village life to urban life,' say the excavation managers. 'The site teaches us that about 5,000 years ago, the first steps were already taken towards the development of an urban society in the Judean Lowlands. A few generations later, we already see large cities in the area, surrounded by a wall, with palaces and other buildings – such as at the site of Tel Yarmouth, which is in this site’s range of vision.' According to Israel Antiquities Authority Director Eli Escusido, 'The Land of Israel, due to its nature and its geographical location, was a fertile ground for the development of ancient civilizations. The Hurvat Husham site uncovered by the researchers of the Israel Antiquities Authority, reveals another important piece in the puzzle of urban development in our region.'

Yemenite drone strike on Israeli coastal city	No one was hurt in the attack, with the projectile falling in an open area. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Ashkelon residents woke up Tuesday morning at 6:40 to sirens warning of the penetration of a threatening UAV headed in their direction. By 6:57, the IDF announced that the incident was over, and twelve minutes later updated that an unmanned aerial vehicle 'from the east' had fallen in an 'open area' in the area of the coastal city that sits close to the northern border of the Gaza Strip. No one was hurt, but a fire broke out in the brambles and bushes where the projectile hit earth. Firefighters and the police were dispatched to put it out and deal with the UAV fragments. An hour and a half later, the army officially stated that the threat had emanated from the Houthis, the Iranian proxy terror group that controls large sections of Yemen. 'Following an initial examination regarding the UAV that fell in an open area in Ashkelon in southern Israel earlier today, it was determined that the UAV was launched from Yemen,' the IDF said in a statement. This is the second time in six weeks that a Houthi projectile managed to penetrate Israel’s air defenses. In mid-September, the terrorists fired what they called a 'hypersonic ballistic missile' at the center of the country, sending over a million Israelis racing for bomb shelters and safe rooms. The missile was hit by an interceptor and fragmented over a large area, doing some damage to a train station in Modiin. Nine people were slightly injured running for cover. Air raid sirens warning of a UAV attack also wailed Tuesday morning around 7am in the Western Galilee city of Nahariya and its environs. This time the UAV was fired from Lebanon, and was shot down mid-air by IAF jets as it was heading for populated areas. Pieces of either the interceptor, UAV, or both hit a train car near the station and one of the cables holding up a pedestrian bridge, with no injuries reported. Hezbollah then launched a barrage of over 40 rockets at the border communities and western northern Galilee in a two-minute period starting at 10:38. Residents reported hearing the booms of missile interceptors hitting their targets. No injuries were immediately reported as the police began scanning the areas where falls were recorded. The IDF reported that over the last 24 hours, dozens of Hezbollah terrorists have been eliminated in South Lebanon by its ground forces and over 110 terror targets were destroyed, including rocket launchers and weaponry warehouses.

Elite police unit held off dozens of Hamas terrorists on October ...	A small number of Unit 33 police officers battled 30 truckloads of Hamas terrorists, preventing them from reaching central Israel. By World Israel News Staff A handful of officers from an elite police unit managed to hold off dozens of invading terrorists for hours on October 7th, 2023, preventing terror cells from reaching the center of the country. Speaking to Channel 12 News, three officers from Unit 33 - also known as Gideonim - spoke about the intense firefight against some 30 trucks and cars carrying Hamas terrorists. One member of the unit, identified only by his Hebrew first initial, Ayin, said that he knew that there was a major incident unfolding when he and other officers were called up and told to report to the South. Ayin saw videos circulating on social media showing terrorists driving through the streets of Sderot, a city adjacent to Gaza. He explained to Channel 12 that security forces classify border breaches according to their severity. Stage A means terrorists have crossed the border, Stage B means that they've reached nearby communities, Stage C means that they've reached Southern cities, and Stage D means that terrorists are bound for major cities in central Israel, such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. 'To me, [the situation] looked like somewhere between ‘C’ and ‘D’,' Ayin told Channel 12. Ayin recounted he and his unit members met at the Black Arrow Memorial, in Mefalsim, less than a kilometer away from the Gaza border. However, the officers were unaware that the site was being used as a staging area for terrorists aiming to drive to central Israeli cities to expand the terror onslaught. At least 30 pickup trucks and cars carrying heavily armed Hamas terrorists were present at the site. They opened fire on the officers, wounding two. The Gideonim officers managed to fire back, engaging in a fearsome battle for hours until IDF units arrived. Despite taking fire from two sides, none of the elite unit's members were killed. The officers killed dozens of terrorists, preventing a more widespread infiltration of Israel.

‘Antisemitic’ – Coldplay store damaged Israel-bound merchandise	Band memorabilia sent to Israel was intentionally damaged; shipping company offers refunds, but won't investigate. By World Israel News Staff Israeli fans of the band Coldplay were shocked to discover that merchandise they ordered was intentionally damaged, presumably because the items were bound for Israel. Numerous Israelis, who are members of Coldplay's fan club, ordered special-edition merchandise that included a record and inserts autographed by the band's members. 'I opened the package and saw that everything was torn and the autographs were ripped,' Coldplay fan Emily Pink told TV journalist Guy Pines. Pink said she had confirmed with other Coldplay fans that everyone in Israel received damaged merchandise. 'A lot of us believe this is antisemitic. This is something that we paid money for, and the damage isn't a mistake - it's intentional,' she added. Idan Karlan, another Coldplay fan, said that everyone who ordered merchandise to Israel received damaged items. 'Apparently the shipping company destroyed the merchandise on purpose when they saw that the package was bound for Israel,' Karlan told Guy Pines. Karlan said that he had received an unsatisfactory response by the shipping company, and that the business appeared to be uninterested in discovering the source of the intentional damage. 'There is something big here, that all packages are sent to Israel damaged like this,' said Karlan. But the 'company simply said, 'here's a full refund, thanks and bye.' Since then, they haven't responded to us.' Shir Beno, who also received damaged merchandise, stressed that the band and shipping company need to take responsibility for the intentional damage. 'It's not about money,' Beno said. 'We should not be sent damaged products just because we are from Israel. If this is due to antisemitism, it needs to be dealt with immediately.' Pink and Karlan said that they were extremely disappointed that Coldplay has not publicly commented on the intentionally damaged merchandise. 'I see them in a different light now,' Pink said.

Israel weighing second attack on Iran, targeting new sites: Repor...	Cabinet members reportedly discussed options for an additional strike on Iran, in a meeting that lasted more than six hours. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet is seriously weighing launching a second attack against Iran, following a strike on the Islamic Republic last weekend. Saturday's strike came after Iran's unprecedented October 1 attack on Israel, which saw Tehran launch some 200 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State. Three weeks later, Israel destroyed numerous strategic sites in Iran, including drone and missile production factories and part of the country's air defense system. But according to Hebrew-language media reports, Israel may launch an additional attack on Iran, specifically as a response for the drone attack on Netanyahu's Caesarea residence. Cabinet members discussed the potential second attack for more than six hours, according to reports. Senior officials, speaking anonymously to Channel 13, said that Iran's governmental buildings and infrastructure - which were avoided in Saturday's attack - may be targeted in the next round of strikes. However, the meeting ended without cabinet ministers and members making a decision regarding moving forward with another attack. Ynet reported that Iran had the ability to launch missiles at Israel during the attack on Saturday, but chose to avoid doing so. Despite public threats by Iranian officials to 'punish' Israel for the recent strike, Israel believes that Tehran is not gearing up for a counter-attack on Israel in the near future. In April, Iran launched a huge aerial assault against Israel, which included explosive drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. While most of those projectiles were intercepted outside of Israeli airspace, the attack marked the first time that Iran directly attacked Israel. After Iran attacked Israel for the second time in six months, Israeli officials said they would strike Iran in a manner which would restore deterrence. However, under heavy American pressure, Israel avoided striking Iran's nuclear development sites and oil assets. Instead, the Israeli airstrikes focused exclusively on military sites, including drone and missile manufacturing centers.

Harris sidelines Biden in final campaign push	The vice president’s team believes Biden is a risk to Harris on the campaign trail but is wary of directly saying they don't want the unpopular president to rally for her. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon In the final days before the election, Vice President Kamala Harris is sidelining her boss, President Joe Biden, over concerns that the octogenarian is a political liability, Axios reported. Harris has no scheduled events with Biden with just eight days until the election. Biden has repeatedly left days open on his schedule to campaign for Harris, but her team has let those days pass without any response, according to sources familiar with the matter. 'He's a reminder of the last four years, not the new way forward,' one source familiar with the situation told Axios. Since replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris has worked to distance herself from the octogenarian and the unpopular policies that brought the administration's approval ratings down to record lows. This dynamic has led to rising tension between Harris’s campaign team and Biden’s senior staff leading up to the election. One person familiar with the situation compared it to a slow, drawn-out break-up between Biden and Harris. The vice president’s team believes Biden is a risk to Harris on the campaign trail but is wary of directly saying they don't want the unpopular president to rally for her. In an email detailing Harris’s Saturday schedule, her campaign highlighted planned events with actress Kerry Washington, Saginaw mayor Brenda Moore (Mich.), Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and others, but Biden's weekend campaigning in Pittsburgh wasn't included on the list. Biden and his team have repeatedly highlighted Harris’s involvement in the White House over the last four years. Earlier this month, Biden praised his vice president for being a 'major player' in all of their administration's actions, saying they were 'singing from the same song sheet.' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has also said that Harris's policy aims are 'aligned' with Biden, stating, 'There's not been any daylight' between the pair’s decisions. When asked this month if she would have 'done something differently than President Biden,' Harris responded, 'There is not a thing that comes to mind.'

‘No legal barrier to banning UNRWA’: Knesset due to blacklist age...	The international community has been pressing Israel not to blacklist UNRWA, claiming there is no alternative in Gaza providing assistance to the local population. By Anna Epshtein, TPS The Israeli Knesset is due to vote on Monday night on a pair of bills banning the controversial United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) from operating in Israel and Gaza. The bills, offered for final vote, would strip UNRWA of its diplomatic immunity and tax-exempt privileges, ban Israeli officials from having any contact with agency staffers and revoke the 1967 exchange of notes between Israel and UNRWA which provided the legal basis for the agency’s activities. UNRWA has been under fire for months, with Israeli officials demanding the agency be stripped of its authority in Gaza and defunded amid revelations that members of the agency’s staff participated in Hamas’s October 7 attacks. 'There is no legal barrier for banning UNRWA from operating in Israel and in the Gaza Strip,' Yifa Segal, an expert in international law and the founder of the International Legal Forum NGO, told The Press Service of Israel. 'The exchange of notes between Israel and UNRWA from 1967 explicitly states that Israel voluntarily agreed to help UNRWA to operate from its territory, and that ‘a provisional agreement between UNRWA and the Government of Israel is to remain in force until replaced or canceled.'' Segal said. 'The time has come to cancel it.' Palestinian refugees are the only refugee population with its own dedicated UN agency. The rest of the world’s refugees fall under the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The international community has been pressing Israel not to blacklist UNRWA, claiming there is no alternative in Gaza providing assistance to the local population. 'But we see that the alternative is emerging – there are numerous aid organizations in Gaza that provide assistance and do not host terror at the same time,' Segal said. 'I think when the world sees that there is an alternative, and providing that Israeli stance on the matter will be firm, it will be only the matter of time that UNRWA will stop getting financing from the European governments.' In July, Israel gave the UN the names of around 100 UNRWA personnel who participated in the attack, held hostages, or were members of Hamas. However, the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services, which investigates mismanagement, fraud, corruption, and other misconduct, only probed 19 personnel. The OIOS did not indicate why it did not investigate the dozens of other workers. Of the 19 staffers who were investigated, the OIOS said nine 'may have been involved in the armed attacks' and that 'the employment of these individuals will be terminated in the interests of the Agency.' On October 24, a Hamas commander who led the assault on a bomb shelter near Kibbutz Re’im and was also a UNRWA employee was killed in an Israeli airstrike. An agency spokesperson confirmed that the commander’s name was included in an Israeli letter in July which identified other Hamas figures on the staff. More than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA in June, accusing the agency of 'aiding and abetting' the terror group. According to the suit, the lead plaintiff, 84-year-old Ditza Heiman of Kibbutz Nir Oz, was held captive for seven weeks in the home of a Palestinian man who said he was a UNRWA teacher at a boy’s school. Israel’s largest bank froze UNRWA’s account in February over suspicious financial transfers that the agency failed to adequately explain. That same month, Israeli forces discovered a Hamas complex located directly under the UNRWA’s Gaza City headquarters and connected directly to the agency’s electricity system. The facility included numerous computer servers belonging to the terror group. UNRWA was also ordered to vacate its Jerusalem offices in May over lease violations. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hamas rejects limited hostage release and ceasefire deal proposed...	Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi proposed an initial two-day ceasefire and hostage-for-prisoner exchange intended to lead to a more comprehensive deal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A day after Egypt proposed a 48-hour ceasefire coinciding with the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, Hamas has rejected the plan, according to a source quoted by e Quds Press news agency on Monday. The source claimed, 'Based on the immense sense of responsibility placed on its shoulders, Hamas always shows readiness to seriously examine proposals conveyed by the mediators.' At the resumption of negotiations in Qatar on Sunday, Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi proposed an initial two-day ceasefire and hostage-for-prisoner exchange intended to lead to a more comprehensive deal. The plan would begin with a 48-hour ceasefire, during which four hostages with foreign citizenship would be released in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. During this period, the delivery of humanitarian aid will be facilitated in Gaza. For the duration, the IDF would remain within Gaza but refrain from operating armored vehicles. On news that Egypt had proposed the two-day ceasefire and hostages for the prisoners release plan, a Palestinian source told Reuters on Sunday that Hamas would be unlikely to accept any deal without a full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza and an end to the war from the outset. The Palestinian official told Reuters, 'I expect Hamas would listen to the new offers, but it remains determined that any agreement must end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza.' On Monday, Netanyahu indicated he would be willing to accept the temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal. At a Likud meeting, he said, 'If there were a deal for a two-day ceasefire to release four hostages, I would take it immediately.' Netanyahu has insisted throughout the war that 'total victory' is the ultimate goal and that he would not be willing to accept a hostage deal that would compromise Israel's objective of ridding Gaza of Hamas as a political and military power. In September, Netanyahu expressed his firm resolve that he would not accept a hostage deal that would force the IDF to abandon the Philadelphi corridor on the border between Gaza and Egypt. The war cabinet voted to retain the condition that Israel would control the Philadelphi corridor as part of any hostage or ceasefire agreement, with National Security Minister Ben Gvir abstaining from the vote. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant voted against it and argued that the IDF could vacate the Philadelphi corridor temporarily as a means to get the hostages released. However, Netanyahu criticized this approach in the press conference without mentioning Gallant by name. 'They tell me to leave, and then we'll return; I've already been in this movie. If we leave – we won't return,' the prime minister added. He stressed that the 'axis of evil' headed by Iran needs access to the Philadelphi corridor, and when Israel was operating there, the enemy had to shift its tactics. 'Only when we entered Philadelphia did we feel a change in the war. For months Hamas did not budge in negotiations for a deal. The first crack came after we entered Rafah and Philadelphi,' Netanyahu said.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated he would potentially accept a limited hostage release deal coinciding with a 48-hour ceasefire, as proposed by Egypt. 'If there was a deal for a two-day ceasefire to release four hostages, I would take it immediately,' Netanyahu stated at the weekly Likud faction meeting. At the resumption of negotiations in Qatar on Sunday, Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi proposed an initial two-day ceasefire and hostage-for-prisoner exchange intended to lead to a more comprehensive deal. The preliminary deal would release four hostages to Israel in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. At a press conference attended by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, al-Sisi expressed hopes that the initial hostage release would lead to a permanent agreement. Last night, a Palestinian source told Reuters that Hamas is likely to consider proposals. Still, it emphasizes a complete ceasefire and a withdrawal of IDF troops from Gaza before hostages are released. The Palestinian official told Reuters, 'I expect Hamas would listen to the new offers, but it remains determined that any agreement must end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza.' For Israel's part, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a condition for a ceasefire is the realization of Israel's goals during the war, namely to eliminate Hamas's political and military control of Gaza. After Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed, Netanyahu urged Hamas to lay down their arms and release the hostages. He said that any Gazans holding hostages will be spared if they lay down their weapons and release captives. 'To the Hamas terrorists, I say: your leaders are fleeing, and they will be eliminated,' Netanyahu said. Addressing families of hostages, Netanyahu said, 'This is an important moment in the war. We will continue with full force until all your loved ones — our loved ones — are returned home. That is our supreme obligation. That is my supreme obligation.

How Israel’s long-awaited counterstrike weakened Iran	Regional analysts believe Israel put up to half of its air force in the sky during the operation, with all pilots returning home unscathed. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Israel’s long-awaited counterstrike on Iran destroyed large swaths of the Islamic Republic's air defenses, including Russian-made missile systems, leaving Tehran more vulnerable than ever to future strikes by the Jewish state or other adversaries. 'We should understand that Tehran is naked right now, the ayatollah has no clothes,' said Richard Goldberg, a former White House National Security Council member who worked the Iran portfolio. 'Israel destroyed Iran’s strategic air defense capabilities and set back its missile and drone production extensively.' Though Iran knew the attack was coming—and was even able to prepare following the explosive leak of classified American intelligence on Israel’s military movements—it still failed to stop more than 100 Israeli Air Force planes as they hit deep inside the Islamic Republic. This was made possible in part by Israel’s initial strike on radar systems stationed in Syria, essentially leaving Tehran blind as Israeli planes flew more than 1,000 miles into Iranian airspace. Satellite imagery reviewed by the Associated Press showed extensive damage to sensitive Iranian military sites, including some previously linked to Tehran’s illicit nuclear weapons program. Other facilities targeted by the Israelis included manufacturing points for Tehran’s ballistic missile industry, which is responsible for fueling the two massive attacks on Israel this year that set the stage for Friday’s retaliatory operation. Iran says four military members were killed during the strike. Regional analysts believe Israel put up to half of its air force in the sky during the operation, with all pilots returning home unscathed. It was the largest direct attack on Iran in Israel’s history and followed years of covert operations meant to sabotage Tehran’s nuclear program, weapons facilities, and oil infrastructure. While the Biden-Harris administration pressured Israel to avoid most of those sites, hoping to ward off a wider regional war, Israel still proved that it can deal Iran a devastating blow. 'Israel fundamentally altered the battlefield in a positive way for the United States and close allies, not just for itself,' said Goldberg, who serves as a senior adviser to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. 'So many years of people telling us what Israel wasn’t capable of doing; so many years of people telling us what Israel just did would be so very challenging for us to do ourselves; so many assumptions reset inside the Beltway once again.' The Pentagon, Goldberg added, should immediately review 'its own assumptions and contingency planning' given the drastically different conditions on the ground in Iran following Israel’s unprecedented assault. As the scope and scale of Israel’s attack came into focus over the weekend, it became clear that Iran’s air defenses are now in tatters. Israel conducted a multi-wave attack that destroyed Tehran’s surface-to-air missile defenses, long portrayed as impenetrable by Iran. This most notably included Iran’s stock of S-300 missile defense systems, which were manufactured and provided by Russia. Israel then hit key military sites tied to the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile program, including in Tehran and the city of Karaj, where multiple explosions were reported. In addition to deploying American F-35 war planes, Israel used 'heavy munitions, long-distance strikes,' and advanced mid-air refueling capabilities to ensure all critical targets were hit, according to the Jerusalem Post. Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ran the operation from a high-tech underground bunker in Tel Aviv known as 'the pit.' The United States and several Arab nations were informed of the attack just before it was launched, according to the Wall Street Journal, which said 'officials in some of those countries then alerted Iran.' Israel says it is prepared for further strikes should Iran respond but signaled there is little appetite for a full-blown war, a position shared with Tehran’s leadership. 'The message is that we don’t want an escalation but if Iran decides to escalate and attack Israel again, this means that we have increased our range of freedom of movement in the Iranian skies,' an Israeli official told the Journal on Saturday, after the dust had settled. Iranian officials sought to downplay the strike over the weekend, with the country’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, reportedly saying during a Sunday cabinet meeting that Tehran 'is not seeking war but will defend its rights in the recent aggression of the criminal Zionist regime.' Iranian state-controlled media claimed 'the country’s air defense units intercepted a significant number of Israeli missiles and stopped its military aircraft from penetrating Iranian airspace,' though Western reports show this is untrue. Iran’s vice president, Mohammad Reza, promised Israel will 'receive an appropriate response,' but there were few indications on Sunday that Tehran is preparing a military reprisal. Privately, the Israeli counterstrike caused 'deep alarm' in Iran, the New York Times reported.

Mother’s calm in crisis linked to lower PTSD symptoms in children...	Mothers who effectively regulated their responses to threats were able to moderate the PTSD symptoms exhibited by their children. By Pesach Benson, TPS An Israeli study of families living at varying distances from the Gaza Strip found that a mother’s ability to regulate her response to stressful and threatening situations can significantly reduce the likelihood of her children developing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, researchers announced on Sunday. PTSD is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. People with PTSD may avoid situations or things that remind them of the traumatic event, and they may have negative changes in beliefs and feelings. In children under the age of six, PTSD symptoms often manifest through play that reenacts the traumatic experience or through frightening dreams. The study, led by Prof. Naama Atzaba-Poria of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, explored the relationship between PTSD symptoms in families living in southern Israel and the mothers’ capacity to regulate and mediate their children’s experiences during times of crisis. The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed Stress and Health journal. 'It seems that the mother’s ability to effectively monitor the relevant information in her environment and to inhibit more impulsive reactions, contributes to her ability to respond in a more reflective way, which sees her children’s needs and helps increase the sense of security, and thus she can create a safer place for them that promotes development,' Atzaba-Poria said. 'As a result, the children may feel more protected and, therefore, at a lower risk of developing PTSD symptoms,' she explained. 'In the clinical aspect and in day-to-day work, these results may be useful in identifying the families that may need more support and assistance under a threat and a complex security situation.' The study focused on families living at varying distances from the Gaza Strip, ranging from communities within 20 kilometers to those up to 40 kilometers away, all facing differing levels of exposure to security threats, such as rocket fire. Researchers surveyed 131 mothers and their firstborn children, aged 10-45 months, during the third trimester of pregnancy with a second child. The participating families, mainly from cities like Beer-Sheva, Sderot, and Ashkelon, faced varying degrees of exposure to security threats. To assess the impact of maternal behavior on child PTSD symptoms, the mothers completed computerized tasks measuring executive functions, including their ability to update working memory or inhibit responses irrelevant to the current situation. Additionally, they filled out online questionnaires designed to identify PTSD symptoms in both themselves and their children. The results indicated a significant link between a mother’s ability to mediate threatening situations and a reduction in PTSD symptoms among children. Specifically, mothers who effectively regulated their responses to threats were able to moderate the PTSD symptoms exhibited by their children. Prof. Atzaba-Poria explained that a mother’s ability to recognize and process pertinent information about the situation — for example, understanding a threat and swiftly taking her child to a safe area — enables her to mediate the event effectively for her child, while also regulating both her own and her child’s emotional responses. Interventions focusing on strengthening parental self-regulation could be a vital strategy in preventing PTSD in children. This approach could be incorporated into clinical practices, especially for families living in conflict zones, ensuring that support is not just child-focused but includes empowering parents to better handle trauma.

Dozens of terrorists were eliminated in Jabaliya in northern Gaza, where tunnel shafts were also neutralized and a large amount of weapons found, according to the military. By JNS A year and a day after launching ground operations against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces on Monday continued to engage terrorist forces across the coastal enclave.

Dozens of terrorists were also eliminated in Jabaliya in northern Gaza, where tunnel shafts were also neutralized and a large amount of weapons found, according to the military. Israeli forces are continuing efforts to evacuate non-combatants to safer areas, despite Hamas deliberately attempting to prevent them from doing so, the IDF said. As an example, civilians were allowed time to leave before the IDF conducted a precision strike against Hamas terrorists embedded inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalyia. According to the IDF, the terrorists who barricaded themselves inside the medical facility included those who participated in the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre of Israeli citizens in the northwestern Negev. During the operation, Israeli soldiers apprehended 100 terrorists from the compound, including terrorists who attempted to escape during the evacuation of civilians. Inside the hospital, soldiers found weapons, terror fund and intelligence documents. While the operation was taking place, the IDF said that the Gaza Coordination and Liaison Administration (CLA) coordinated with the hospital to ensure essential hospital services were maintained, including activating an additional generator, ensuring electricity and oxygen supply for patients. 'Throughout the war, Hamas terrorists have repeatedly operated from inside hospitals across the Gaza Strip, using them to hold hostages, execute terror attacks, and store weapons and explosives,' the IDF said. 'The IDF will continue to act in accordance with international law and act against the Hamas terrorist organization, while avoiding harm to civilians.' The IDF also provided video documentation of an ambulance driver from Kamal Radwan who testified that Hamas terrorists used the hospital to conduct activities.

Israeli laser defense set for 2025 deployment after $536 million ...	The Magan Or system is designed to intercept a wide range of aerial threats, including rockets, mortars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and cruise missiles. By Pesach Benson, TPS An Israeli laser-based air defense system under development is expected to become operational in mid-2025, the Israeli Defense Ministry said on Monday as it announced the signing of a 2 billion-shekel ($536 million) order to expand its production. The Magen Or system, more commonly referred to as 'Iron Beam,' is the laser equivalent of Israel’s better-known Iron Dome system. 'At the outbreak of the war, the Ministry of Defense signed hundreds of orders worth tens of billions of shekels, to strengthen the independence of blue and white production and to build the strength of the [Israel Defense Forces],' said Major General (Res.) Eyal Zamir, the Defense Ministry’s Director General. 'The ‘Magen Or’ deal is one of the most important deals we have signed, as it heralds the beginning of a new era on the battlefield – the laser era,' which Zamir said 'is expected to enter operational service in a year from today. The ‘Magan Or’ deal will ensure the continuation and acceleration of equipping many more laser systems.' The Magan Or system is designed to intercept a wide range of aerial threats, including rockets, mortars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and cruise missiles. The plan is to integrate Iron Beam into the Iron Dome system. In the future, an algorithm will determine whether to shoot down aerial threats with a laser or the Tamir interceptors. Iron Dome’s Tamir interceptor missiles reportedly cost around $50,000 apiece and require replenishing. However, the 100-kilowatt laser has a range of about eight to 10 kilometers (five to six miles), which is considerably shorter than that of Iron Dome. Each laser can engage a single threat at a time, unlike the Iron Dome, which can intercept multiple threats simultaneously. In 2022, then-prime minister Naftali Bennett said the system would 'bankrupt' Israel’s enemies. 'Until today, it cost us a lot of money to intercept each rocket. Today they can invest tens of thousands of dollars in a rocket and we will invest $2 on the electricity for intercepting that rocket,' Bennett said at the time. The Iron Dome system put Israel on the map with its ability to shoot down short-range threats such as rockets, missiles and mortars. It was first deployed in March 2011, and the following month, it scored its very first interception. The primary contractors for Iron Beam’s production are Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems, both based in Haifa. In January 2020, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced three different laser programs: A ground-based laser to supplement Iron Dome, a mobile system to protect military units during maneuvers and an aerial system capable of downing threats from above. The aerial version will give Israel the ability to use lasers against rockets above cloud cover. Israel’s multi-layered air defenses drew considerable international attention for intercepting a variety of ballistic and cruise missiles and drones launched by Iran and its proxies during the past year. The Arrow-3 system is capable of intercepting ballistic missiles in space. The system made its first interception when it shot down a ballistic missile fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The interception is widely believed to have taken place outside the earth’s atmosphere, which would make Israel the first country to shoot down a missile in space. But Israel has not confirmed that detail. Other layers of Israel’s air defense system include David’s Sling which is designed to shoot down medium-range threats at high altitudes, and the C-Dome system, designed to protect naval vessels from short-range threats.

Report: Frantic Hezbollah members deserting the organization in d...	Attacks on Hezbollah's leadership, bombings against thousands of operatives, and IDF's ground operation in southern Lebanon have crushed morale in the Iran-backed terror group, leading to mass desertions according to report. By World Israel News Staff Morale among operatives in the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah has plummeted in recent weeks, according to a report Sunday, following a string of targeted Israeli attacks against the organization's leadership, and the ongoing ground operation in southern Lebanon. The Arabic-language Elaph outlet published a report Sunday citing multiple sources who claim that Hezbollah is now facing large-scale desertions, as panicked operatives affiliated with the terror group attempt to distance themselves from Hezbollah to avoid attacks by Israel. According to the sources cited by the report, a growing number of Hezbollah operatives are no longer reporting to their handlers when summoned. In addition, a number of Hezbollah terrorists have fled Lebanon since Israeli forces entered southern Lebanon, and have sought sanctuary in Syria - and to avoid being called up by Hezbollah's leadership for combat missions against the IDF. The wave of desertions, which has hit Hezbollah hardest in southern Lebanon, has forced the terror group to dispatch reinforcements from other areas of the country. The sudden and dramatic loss of manpower, particularly on the southern front, has reportedly impaired Hezbollah's ability to communicate effectively with and direct its forces in some sectors of southern Lebanon. The drop in morale has also hampered Hezbollah's recruitment efforts, making it more difficult to replace terrorists who have been killed or wounded, or who have deserted. On September 17th and 18th, thousands of Hezbollah terrorists were injured when pagers and handheld radios exploded simultaneously, apparently part of an Israeli covert operation. The Shi'ite organization was rocked again on September 27th when its secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Nasrallah's heir apparent, Hashem Safieddine, head of Hezbollah's executive council, was killed just days later in another IDF airstrike in Beirut.

Hamas shields terrorists in hospitals, ambulances, says Gaza para...	Gaza ambulance driver arrested by Israel over his ties to Hamas admits that the terror group controls hospitals, using medical facilities and ambulances for military purposes. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization has embedded itself in the operations of medical centers in the Gaza Strip, and has commandeered much of the coastal enclave's ambulance system, using emergency vehicles to transport and shield terrorists, Hamas operatives captured by the IDF say. On Monday, the IDF released footage from the interrogation of a Gaza ambulance driver and paramedic linked to Hamas - one of multiple interrogations which the Israeli military says corroborates the accusations of the terror group's misuse of hospitals and ambulances. During the interrogation, recorded in October, the Hamas operative testified that the terror group had completely taken over the operation of the Kamal Adwan Medical Center in Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip. The IDF released the testimony a day after an airstrike hit the hospital, killing 40 and injuring over 80, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. Israel has claimed that the hospital was subverted by Hamas for military purposes. In the footage released by Israel's military, the ambulance driver said that 'Hamas members are present' throughout Kamal Adwan Medical Center. 'They are in the courtyards, at the gates of the buildings, in the offices of Kamal Adwan Hospital.' Ambulances, he continued, have been requisitioned for use not only as medical evacuation vehicles for terrorists, but also to ferry Hamas terrorists to and from attacks. 'They operate ambulances to transport their wounded military operatives, and to transport them for their missions, and this is instead of using the ambulances for the benefit of civilians.' 'We, the public in the northern Gaza Strip, are sick of this situation. We have had enough; they are stationed in the hospitals, stationed in the schools.' In a joint statement released by the IDF and Shin Bet internal security agency, Israeli security officials said that nearly 100 terrorist suspects were arrested in a raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital following Sunday's airstrike. The captured terrorists included a number who had taken part in the atrocities of October 7th, the statement said.

‘Unimaginable consequences’ – Iran threatens to escalate conflict...	Iranian foreign ministry accuses Israel of ‘genocidal war,’ says Tehran is prepared to respond with ‘all available tools.’ By World Israel News Staff The Iranian government threatened to escalate the ongoing conflict with Israel, saying Tehran is prepared to respond to Israeli retaliatory strikes conducted over the weekend. On Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei denounced Israel for its airstrikes on Iranian military positions Saturday, while hinting at further escalations. Over 100 Israeli air force jets struck Iranian military positions across Iran, Syria, and Iraq Saturday morning, more than three weeks after Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel. At least four Iranian soldiers were killed in the Israeli reprisal. Baghaei told reporters Monday that Iran 'will use all available tools to deliver a definite and effective response to the Zionist regime,' without elaborating on Tehran’s plans. According to the official Iranian state media outlet IRNA, Baghaei said Iran 'reserves the right to respond' to Israeli 'aggression in accordance with international law.' Israel’s attacks on Iran over the weekend were grave 'miscalculation by Israel,' Baghaei added, while accusing Israel of conducting a 'genocidal war in occupied Palestine' and 'genocide and crimes' in Lebanon. Hossein Salami, chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, also alluded to possible reprisals by Iran on Israel for Saturday’s retaliatory strikes. Israel, Salami said on Monday, 'failed to achieve its ominous goals,' calling the strikes a sign of 'miscalculation and helplessness. Salami added that the 'bitter consequences' for Israel 'will be unimaginable.' A day earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the United States for supporting Israel, blaming Washington for Saturday’s airstrikes. 'The Americans’ partnership in Israel’s operation is quite clear for us,' Araghchi said. 'The least they did was to provide Israel’s air force with a space corridor, and also, the defense equipment they earlier delivered to Israel is, in a way, considered complicity in this operation against Iran.' 'We maintain that the US partnership in Israel’s crimes and escalation of tension in West Asia is quite clear and Washington bears responsibility for it.'

Mark Daou, an independent Druze politician, recently spoke out about Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah on a Lebanese talk show. 'It appears now that Hezbollah, as a military force, is finished,' Daou said, according to a translation of his remarks by blogger Abu Ali Express. He said that the success of the Israeli ground invasion of southern Lebanon demonstrated that Hezbollah had been defanged. The fact that Hezbollah has failed to expel Israeli troops from the region demonstrates the terror group’s weakness, he said. 'We see the videos, how Israel brought in intensional reporters and showed them around Lebanese territory,' Daou continued. The Israelis 'hold territory so well that they’re already hosting guests,' he added. Hezbollah 'no longer exists as a military force,' the MP emphasized. 'As a regional power? Bye-bye, it’s over.' Daou's remarks come on the heels of a recent report that Hezbollah is struggling with mass desertions, following the slaying of the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. According to Arabic-language news outlet Elaph, widespread defections have hindered Hezbollah's ability to continue attacking Israel. Some Hezbollah terrorists are fleeing to Syria with their families, while others are failing to report to their assigned stations. Hezbollah is also struggling to recruit new terrorists to replace those killed or severely maimed in battle against IDF troops. Due to the amount of Hezbollah terrorists who have abandoned their posts in southern Lebanon following the Israeli ground invasion, Hezbollah has been forced to send reinforcements to what was once a major stronghold for the group. While the desertions are primarily concentrated to southern Lebanon, senior Hezbollah officials fear that the defections could spread to other parts of the country.

Iran blames US for Israeli retaliatory strikes	America 'complicit' in Israeli attacks, says Iranian foreign minister, saying Washington 'bears responsibility' after Israeli warplanes bombed Iran's missile defense network. By World Israel News Staff Iran blamed the United States on Sunday for a series of Israeli airstrikes Saturday, calling Washington 'complicit.' Over 100 Israeli jet fighters struck military targets across Iran on Saturday, including in Tehran, and the Ilan and Khuzestan provinces. In addition, Israeli jets struck Iranian positions in Syria and Iraq. At least four Iranian soldiers were killed in the strikes, which came in retaliation for the October 1st ballistic missile attacks by Iran on Israel, in which over 180 missiles were launched. A day after Israel's retaliatory strikes, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi linked the United States to the attacks in a televised address. 'The Americans' partnership in Israel's operation is quite clear for us,' Araghchi said. Iran's foreign affairs chief said that Tehran holds Washington 'responsible' for the Israeli reprisals, and claimed that Israel would be powerless in the region were it not for support from the United States. 'The least they did was to provide Israel's air force with a space corridor, and also, the defense equipment they earlier delivered to Israel is, in a way, considered complicity in this operation against Iran.' 'We maintain that the US partnership in Israel's crimes and escalation of tension in West Asia is quite clear and Washington bears responsibility for it.' Araghchi said Iran blamed the U.S. not only for Israel's strikes on Iran on Saturday, but also for all Israeli military action against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip and against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Turning to his petition to the United Nations Security Council, calling on the council to hold an emergency session and to take action against Israel, Araghchi lamented that because of the American veto in the council, no decisive resolutions would likely be passed.

Left-wing lawmaker under fire for calling fallen Israeli soldier ...	The far leftist MK should also be fined heftily for calling Sgt. Maj. Shuvael Ben-Natan a 'criminal' and a 'monster,' says Zionist group Betzalmo. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An Israeli human rights group called Sunday for far-left MK Ofer Cassif to be suspended from the Knesset and fined a hefty sum for slandering an IDF soldier who recently fell in battle in Lebanon. Betzalmo head Shai Glick wrote an urgent letter to the Knesset Ethics Committee after Cassif, the only Jewish member of the Hadash-Taal party, went online to brand Sgt. Maj. Shuvael Ben-Natan as a 'criminal' and 'monster.' 'The time has come to put an end to incitement and slander against IDF soldiers,' Glick wrote. 'This is a serious blow to the honor of the fallen, his family and the IDF's heritage. It is inconceivable that a Knesset member will call a fallen soldier a 'monster' and spread inciting and false claims about him.' Glick demanded that the MK be suspended immediately and levied the maximum fine possible, NIS100,000, to send the message that such statements were unacceptable. Cassif had charged that 'At the funeral of a settler killed in Lebanon as a reserve soldier, his eulogizers praised him for murdering a 40-year-old Palestinian who was harvesting olives on his land, for seeking blood revenge and seeking to murder as many women and children as possible in Gaza, and for burning down a house there just for the fun of it.' 'Despite his criminal views and actions,' the MK continued, 'he was drafted and sent to Gaza and Lebanon where he was able to carry out his sickening ideas. Monsters like him are now sitting in the government and setting policies. It is not the security of Israel and its citizens that motivates them, but a disturbed and bloodthirsty messianism.' Ben-Natan’s brother had noted in his eulogy that the soldier had wanted to avenge the massacre Hamas had perpetrated on October 7, against 'everyone you saw,' while a fellow soldier described the 22-year-old as 'the biggest goofball in the platoon' who had set fire to a home against orders 'to boost morale.' Some 11 months ago, when Ben-Natan was on leave from the army, he went walking with his family near their Samarian home in Rehalim. A group of Palestinians surrounded them and began stoning them. Feeling their lives were in danger, he shot one of them, killing him. When army forces came, they arrested him but none of the Arabs, threw him in jail for two weeks, and he had to battle the authorities to allow him to return to his unit to fight in Gaza, and eventually, in Lebanon. On the way to eulogize Ben-Natan at his funeral last week, Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan said that he had been told that the case against Ben-Natan had finally been closed as the allegations against him were proven false, but as the soldier was still at the front he never found out that his name had been cleared. Glick told World Israel News that this was far from the first time Cassif had blackened the name of the IDF, and it was time he was punished for doing so. 'From the beginning, after the horrific massacre, Ofer Cassif has been working day and night on only one thing - to slander and harm the State of Israel and the IDF,' Glick said. 'He petitioned against Israel in The Hague [joining South Africa’s spurious charge that the IDF was committing genocide in Gaza], calls for the imposition of an arms embargo on Israel ,and repeatedly defames the soldiers of the IDF, the security forces and the members of the emergency response squads, calling them murderers and war criminals.' 'Yesterday he went even further and called a fallen soldier (!) a killer and a monster,' he added. 'This man belongs in prison a long time ago. But until then, the ethics committee has a clear obligation to kick him out of the Knesset and give him the highest fine.' After Cassif had supported South Africa’s lawsuit, 84 MKs voted to expel him from the legislature in February but this was six short of the 90 necessary and he remained in his position. Ben-Natan was killed along with three other members of his reserve Carmeli Brigade on Wednesday, after Hezbollah terrorists jumped out from a tunnel in a southern Lebanon village and threw grenades at the soldiers.

‘Trump sides with Israel, Harris sides with the terrorists’ – Rud...	Former New York City mayor blasts Democrats and Biden administration over handling of Israel's war against Hamas and Hezbollah, accusing them of siding with 'the terrorists.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani accused Democrats of siding with Hamas and Hezbollah against Israel, during a campaign rally in New York City on Sunday. Speaking at a Trump campaign event headlined by the former president, Giuliani took aim at the Biden administration over its handling of the war in Gaza and south Lebanon, claiming that while Republicans back Israel, Democrats are 'on the side of the terrorists.' 'September 11th was our darkest hour. October 7th was Israel's darkest hour. They are our best friend,' Giuliani said. 'I worked for Ronald Reagan for eight years. Ronald Reagan said we have to be there for Israel because they are are always there for us.' 'I'm on the side of Israel, you're on the side of Israel. Donald Trump's on the side of Israel. And they are on the side of the terrorists!' Giulani also warned that Palestinians are 'taught to kill' Americans, and accused Vice President Kamala Harris of working to bring Gazans to the United States, likely a reference to reports this year that the Biden administration is mulling granting refugee status to some Gazans. 'Hamas is not there for us, Iran is not there for us - they want to kill us,' Giuliani continued. 'And the Palestinians are taught to kill us at two years old.' 'They won't let a Palestinian in Jordan, they won't let a Palestinian in Egypt, and Harris wants to bring them to you.' 'They may be good people, I'm sorry, I don't take a risk with people that are taught to kill Americans at two.' Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (New York) also blasted the Biden administration and Harris over their record on Israel. 'A year ago, our most precious ally, Israel, was under attack from Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists,' Stefanik said at Sunday's gathering. Harris, Stefanik claimed, was 'turning her back on Israel.'

Iran’s missile program set back, but nuclear threat remains	The damage to Iran’s missile production sites is currently unknown, but might also slow down Tehran’s efforts to replenish and upgrade its ballistic missile arsenal, degrading a key component of Iran’s military strategy. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS Israel’s airstrikes on military targets in Iran overnight Friday damaged the Islamic Regime’s missile program and air defenses, while demonstrating the Israeli Air Force’s advanced long-range capabilities. However, Iran’s nuclear program was left unscathed, suggesting that Israel’s government factored in U.S. pressure to keep the attack limited in nature. The question going forward is whether the damage to Iran’s missile and air defense infrastructure have paved the way for future strikes. Iranian state media has reported that targets were hit in three main regions: Tehran, Khuzestan (in southwest Iran) and Ilam (western Iran). The attack, which Israel named 'Operation Days of Repentance,' saw tens of IAF jets, accompanied by refuelers, travel some 1,600 kilometers from Israeli territory. The IAF achieved near uncontested aerial supremacy in Iranian skies. While Iranian state media is playing down the impact, the attack at the very least demonstrated Israel’s ability to strike deep in Iranian territory and conduct complex, multi-wave operations without sustaining losses. Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Hezi Halevi commanded the operation from IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv, alongside IAF Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar. According to the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit, the mission was successful, with all aircraft returning safely. Following the strikes, Reuters cited a senior Biden administration official as saying that while Washington 'was prepared to respond to any Iranian retaliation, President Joe Biden anticipated that Iran would not escalate the situation.' This aligns with a broader pattern of U.S. pressure on Israel to avoid direct attacks against Iran’s nuclear program, especially with U.S. elections just days away and amid ongoing diplomatic efforts by the U.S. aimed to avoid direct American involvement in a war against Iran. As such, the attack was not only a military maneuver by Israel, but also a diplomatic one. By avoiding a direct confrontation over the nuclear issue, the Iranian regime was given the opportunity to de-escalate. The immediate tactical question following the operation is whether Israel’s strikes have sufficiently degraded Iran’s missile and air defense capabilities to influence future engagements. If Iran’s air defense network was significantly weakened, Israel may have an advantage in any potential follow-up operation. The fact that the operation spanned several hours, with multiple waves of attacks, suggests a sustained and methodical effort to diminish Iran’s military response capabilities. The damage to Iran’s missile production sites is currently unknown, but might also slow down Tehran’s efforts to replenish and upgrade its ballistic missile arsenal, degrading a key component of Iran’s military strategy. The key strategic question now is whether Israel anticipates a 'Stage B.' While the recent strikes achieved tactical gains, Israel’s decision not to engage Iran’s nuclear facilities suggests that a future attack might hinge on Iran’s response or any perceived shift by Iran to break out to a nuclear bomb. If the recent strike has indeed undermined Iran’s air defenses and missile capabilities, Israel might find a second wave—targeting more sensitive or strategically crucial sites—logistically simpler. Yet Iran’s nuclear advancements continue. According to Sima Shine, director of the Iran and the Shi’ite Axis Research Program at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, within two to three weeks, Iran can enrich enough uranium for three nuclear devices. The parallel effort of creating a nuclear warhead, she told JNS this month, would take more time, though she noted Iran could also decide to just create a bomb without a missile warhead. 'We’re talking about roughly six months to a year and a half,' she said. 'What is needed is a political decision' on Tehran’s part. In light of these developments, the focus on missile production and air defenses suggests Israel is playing a longer game, seeking to degrade Iran’s immediate military threat while leaving room for future strikes. 'Operation Days of Repentance' thus stands as a calculated maneuver, but one that leaves open critical questions about what comes next, and whether Israel has set the stage for a more decisive confrontation with Iran’s nuclear program.

US Democratic Senator: ‘Why are people criticizing Israel? They s...	Senator Fetterman praised the exploding beeper incident 'because it targeted for members of Hezbollah. You know, no one uses beepers in that situation other than they were a member of Hezbollah.' By JNS Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) defended his statement that he loved Israel’s attack on Hezbollah pagers in a recent interview with the New York Times. 'It was targeted for members of Hezbollah,' the pro-Israel Democrat said. 'You know, no one uses beepers in that situation other than they were a member of Hezbollah.' The interviewer noted that a young child was killed. 'Unfortunately, tragically, because Daddy was a member of Hezbollah. He brought that danger and evil into their home,' Fetterman said. 'That’s what tragically resulted in that poor child’s death, and that’s what’s so terrible. She paid the price because her father was a terrorist for Hezbollah.' Fetterman added that he thinks a two-state solution is an ideal but isn’t sure any longer that one is possible. The Times interviewer asked Fetterman about the 'nuance' about the 'price' being paid in innocent life in Gaza. Fetterman said 'there isn’t any nuance.' 'You think that the price that’s been paid is fair?' the interviewer asked. 'The price is terrible. It’s awful. That’s history and that’s war, and Israel was forced to fight an enemy that are cowardly,' he said. 'They hide in tunnels. They hide in schools and in refugee camps, and they’re in those kinds of places.' 'That forces them to reach them—they have to go through these civilians,' Fetterman said. 'That’s why they’re so evil, and that’s why that’s designed—the death and destruction and the misery, was designed by Hamas. They understood that that’s going to happen. They don’t care.' 'Some people blame Israel,' the senator said. 'Well, I blame Hamas.' The interviewer asked Fetterman to comment on Netanyahu’s leadership. The senator responded that it is 'really curious' that many Democrats decided they couldn’t criticize Israel, so instead they went after Netanyahu. 'You can think he’s a bad leader or a bad person or anything, but that happens to be the democratically-leader of Israel, and he’s on our side,' Fetterman said. 'That’s our ally, and if you had to pick who you want to criticize, you should be criticizing Hamas. You should be calling out Iran, or you should be calling out Hezbollah. Certainly not our ally.' Fetterman added that there are 'idiots in this nation' who chant 'from the river to the sea.' 'A least own your antisemitism rather than trying to hide behind a turn on words,' he said.

Egypt proposes 2-day hostage-for-prisoner exchange as first step ...	al-Sisi revealed that the preliminary deal would release four hostages to Israel in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News At the resumption of negotiations in Qatar, Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi proposed a 2-day initial hostage-for-prisoner exchange intended to lead to a more general captive release and ceasefire plan. On Sunday, al-Sisi revealed that the preliminary deal would release four hostages to Israel in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. At a press conference attended by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, al-Sisi expressed hopes that the initial hostage release would lead to an extensive and final deal. Although neither Israel nor Hamas has yet commented on Egypt's proposal, a Palestinian official told Reuters, 'I expect Hamas would listen to the new offers, but it remains determined that any agreement must end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza.' For Israel's part, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a condition for a ceasefire is the realization of Israel's goals during the war, namely to eliminate Hamas's political and military control of Gaza. The Saudi network Asharq reported that Hamas plans to propose a 'comprehensive deal to end the war immediately' which will demand the complete withdrawal of the IDF before the hostages are released. A Hamas official explained their version of a deal 'would end the war once and for all, and would include a prisoner swap where all Israeli hostages are released in exchange for an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons' and added that without the end of the war 'there will be no deal.' Mossad director David Barnea along with CIA director William Burns have congregated in Doha with Qatari and Egyptian mediators to seek an end to the year-long war in Gaza and to solidify a deal that would release hostages Hamas captured on October 7th. Barnea has been working on a new framework for a hostage release deal which will be adjusted to include some points from the Egyptian plan. Hamas has rejected a deal put forward by Mossad chief David Barnea that would allow immunity and safe passage for Hamas terrorists in exchange for the hostages in Gaza, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. David Barnea met with Egyptian officials last week, but Hamas rejected the proposal.

Iran jails citizens for filming its military humiliation	Iran’s crackdown on information sharing comes as details of Saturday’s early morning Israeli strikes remain uncertain. By Jewish Breaking News Iran is threatening to jail any citizens who share footage of Israel’s strikes, with authorities warning that distributing images or information to 'hostile media affiliated with the Zionist regime could result in sentences ranging from one to 10 years in prison,' reports the Telegraph. Despite the Islamic regime’s strict censorship laws, many Iranians continue to circumvent restrictions using VPNs, enabling access to social media platforms where footage of missiles flying over Tehran has been circulating. Iran’s crackdown on information sharing comes as details of Saturday’s early morning Israeli strikes remain uncertain. What is known is that the attacks targeted air defense systems and missile production facilities across Iran, though the precise number of targets and extent of damage have not been disclosed by the IDF. Notably, there are no credible reports of Iranian air defenses successfully intercepting any Israeli missiles during the operation, nor of fighter jets being scrambled to counter the threat. While the Islamic Republic’s establishment attempts to downplay the strikes as ineffective and praise Iran’s air defenses, the regime faces mounting pressure from hardliners demanding retaliation. However, Iran’s response options appear limited. Having already launched hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel twice this year with minimal impact, and lacking an effective air force, the country’s retaliatory capabilities are largely restricted to medium-range ballistic missiles of uncertain accuracy. According to Iran International, while the Islamic Republic possesses approximately 3,000 missiles at its disposal, the core issue isn’t weapon availability but rather Iran’s vulnerability to Israeli counterstrikes. Any significant retaliation could prompt Israel to target critical economic infrastructure, particularly Iran’s domestic oil refineries. The destruction of even one of Iran’s two major refineries could trigger serious domestic problems as winter approaches. Furthermore, Iran’s traditional strategy of confronting Israel through its terror proxies has also shown signs of weakening. Both Hezbollah and Hamas have been significantly degraded by recent Israeli operations, with Hezbollah unable to launch the massive rocket barrages that many analysts feared could overwhelm Israeli air defenses. document.createElement('video'); The post Iran jails citizens for filming its military humiliation appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/iran-jails-citizens-for-filming-its-military-humiliation/	2024-10-27T10:50:29-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IAF-female-pilot.png
Trump campaign ad features Holocaust survivor rebutting Harris’ ‘...	Both campaigns are fighting for Jewish voters who make up significant constituencies in multiple swing states. By Philissa Cramer, JTA A new campaign ad for Donald Trump pushes back against Kamala Harris’ claim that the former president is a 'fascist' by featuring a Holocaust survivor who says Harris is disgracing his murdered family members with the allegation. 'Adolf Hitler invaded Poland when I was 9 years old. He murdered my parents and most of my family,' says 94-year-old Jerry Wartski, an Auschwitz survivor and retired New York City real estate investor in the ad released Friday. 'I know more about Hitler than Kamala will ever know in a thousand lifetimes. For her to accuse President Trump of being like Hitler is the worst thing I’ve ever heard in my 75 years living in the United States,' Wartski continues. 'I know President Trump, and he would never say this. And Kamala Harris knows it. She owes my parents and everybody else who was murdered by Hitler an apology for repeating this lie.' The ad follows a mounting discourse about the use of the term 'fascist' in the presidential race. The discourse accelerated last week after The Atlantic reported that Trump had reportedly expressed admiration for Hitler’s generals. Harris applied the label to Trump herself for the first time during a CNN town hall meeting Wednesday night. Asked whether she believed Trump was a fascist, she answered, 'Yes, I do.' She also said Americans believe in democracy and 'not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.' The ad is meant to rebut the criticism at a pivotal time. An ABC poll released Friday found that half of registered voters consider Trump a fascist, suggesting that the concern could play a meaningful role in the Nov. 5 election. The poll, conducted before the most recent headlines, found that about 8% of voters planned to vote for Trump despite believing that he was a fascist. Contrary to Wartski’s suggestion in the video, Trump has referred to Harris as a fascist multiple times in the past. The poll also found that one in five voters would apply the label to Harris. Wartski’s deployment in the campaign ad reflects the particular resonance of fascism for Jewish voters given fascism’s strong historical association with Hitler and the Nazis, and the degree to which Jewish ideas and concerns are playing a central role in the presidential race in its final days. Both campaigns are fighting for Jewish voters who make up significant constituencies in multiple swing states. Wartski, a retired New York City real estate entrepreneur, is a registered Republican who has donated extensively to national Republicans, including Trump, and to local Democratic politicians, according to campaign finance records. Earlier this month, he accompanied Trump on a visit to the Rebbe’s Ohel, the Queens gravesite of the last Chabad-Lubavitch rabbi. In the ad, Wartski, rolling up his sleeve to show a number tattooed on his arm, is asked by a voice off-screen, 'Why should the Jewish people support President Trump?' He answers: 'Because he’s a mensch. I believe that President Trump is definitely going to be good for Israel, because in everything he’s done up to now was in favor. He’s never double-crossed anyone, and he never showed any weakness. … He has always stood with the Jewish people and the state of Israel.' (The ad is not the first to employ the word 'mensch,' Yiddish for a decent and upstanding person, in a presidential campaign, though it is the first to come from a candidate’s campaign. In 2020, the Jewish Democratic Council of America promoted Joe Biden as a 'mensch in the White House.') Until recently, Wartski — the honorary president of the Israel Heritage Foundation advocacy group, which last year honored Trump by giving him a silver Torah crown. Wartski also drew attention more recently as the landlord of a Manhattan table tennis club whose operator, Wang Chen, credits him with facilitating her success in the sport. Wartski gave his first-ever interview about his Holocaust experience in 2020 to Fox News, when he and his family traveled to Auschwitz to mark the 75th anniversary of its liberation. He described narrowly evading death for two years in two ghettos — first in his hometown of Osjakow, Poland, and then in the bigger city of Lodz — before his family was sent to Auschwitz. His mother, Esther, was murdered there, while his father, Jacob, died of starvation after a forced march just before Allied troops arrived. Wartski and his brother survived and spent years in Displaced Persons camps — where he said he first encountered ping-pong — before being allowed into the United States in 1949. He said he had not told his children about his experience but had reconsidered as he reached 90. 'Now I see that there are not a lot of people left who can tell the story,' Wartski said at the time. 'The stories that you hear are just unreal and unbelievable, and you have to talk.' 94-year-old Holocaust survivor decries Kamala & Co.'s claim that 'Trump is Hitler' Jerry Wartski, a 94-year-old survivor of Auschwitz, was 9 years old in 1939 when Hitler invaded Poland, 'murdered my parents and most of my family.'

Federal judge orders Virginia to reinstate noncitizens on voter r...	​​Virginia’s attorney general, Jason Miyares condemned the judge’s order. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon A federal judge on Friday ordered Virginia to reinstate 1,600 noncitizen voter registrations that Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R.) removed this year in an effort to disqualify illegal noncitizens from voting in the November election. U.S. district judge Patricia Giles, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, granted the Department of Justice's request for an injunction against the state, citing evidence submitted in court that some individuals removed from the rolls were eligible voters, the Associated Press reported. Youngkin, however, argued against the judge’s ruling, saying the individuals who were removed 'self-identified themselves as noncitizens.' 'Let’s be clear about what just happened: only eleven days before a Presidential election, a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate over 1,500 individuals—who self-identified themselves as noncitizens—back onto the voter rolls,' Youngkin said. 'Almost all these individuals had previously presented immigration documents confirming their noncitizen status, a fact recently verified by federal authorities.' ​​Virginia’s attorney general, Jason Miyares, also condemned the judge’s order. 'It should never be illegal to remove an illegal voter,' he said. 'Yet, today a Court—urged by the Biden-Harris Department of Justice—ordered Virginia to put the names of noncitizens back on the voter rolls, mere days before a presidential election,' he wrote in a statement. Miyares added that the Biden-Harris administration was working to 'weaponize the legal system against the enemies of so-called progress,' calling the case 'bullying, pure and simple.' Youngkin and Miyares both said Virginia plans to appeal the ruling and take the case all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. Youngkin announced on Aug. 7 that election officials had removed 6,303 noncitizens from the state’s voter rolls since January 2022. The DOJ then sued the state earlier this month for removing some of those voters from rolls 'too close to the Nov. 5 general election,' which it said violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993.

‘We have not broken’: Israel marks anniversary of October 7 attac...	Israeli President Isaac Herzog called on the government to capitalize on the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to bring home the remaining hostages being held in Gaza. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Israeli leaders stressed national unity, strength and resilience as the country marked the anniversary of the October 7 attacks on Sunday. The state ceremony, at Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl cemetery, came one after Israel’s Air Force struck targets in Iran on Saturday. 'We are in the midst of a long and difficult existential war, a war that exacts painful prices from us. We are all determined to continue the fight against those who seek our lives, and we will continue to pursue the murderers and their agents to the end,' said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'We suffered a severe blow, but we have not broken. Immense pain has struck us, but we have not disintegrated. We retaliated fiercely, and we have been doing so ever since… A war of annihilation has been imposed upon us, and we are responding with a war of revival,' Netanyahu insisted. 'This is an existential war – a war on seven fronts against the axis of evil led by Iran. The Air Force attacked throughout Iran, and we have dealt a severe blow to Iran’s defense capabilities and its ability to produce missiles,' he added. The airstrikes are reported to have damaged Iranian military bases, air defense systems, and factories associated with the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile and drone programs. Thursday, the Hebrew anniversary of the massacre, coincides with the holiday of Simchat Torah. The commemoration was delayed to Sunday so as not to conflict with the Sabbath. Israeli President Isaac Herzog called on the government to capitalize on the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to bring home the remaining hostages being held in Gaza. 'The critical, supreme task still lies ahead of us — to urgently bring back the hostages from the hands of the murderers,' Herzog said. 'The elimination of the arch-terrorist Sinwar and other enemies, and the impressive fighting by the IDF and security forces, have created an opportunity that we must not miss.' Sinwar was killed in a chance encounter with Israeli soldiers in Rafah on October 16 'Recent days have again reminded us of the heavy and painful price of war; so many families have joined the circle of bereavement, stricken with grief and sorrow, and the heart of the entire nation breaks again and again,' Herzog added. 'But even when the campaign is tough, one thing is clear: the only way to endure these difficult days is together, with a deep belief in the justness of our path,' he stressed. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant acknowledged the loss Israel experienced this year while highlighting the military’s achievements. 'In this year, we have dealt significant blows to our enemies and created a different security reality around us. But the prices are heavy – very heavy. Eight hundred and ninety-eight fallen have opened wounds in the heart of the nation. Our finest sons and daughters, IDF fighters and security forces have fallen since October 7 until today,' Gallant said. The near-destruction of Hamas and the deterioration of Hezbollah’s power, the Defense Minister said, 'Create a shift in the balance of power between Israel and its enemies, allowing us, at the political level, to realize the war’s objectives and make decisions from a position of strength and deterrence, in order to achieve a different reality in the Middle East.' After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Iran’s ‘supreme leader’ seriously ill—report	There is internal turmoil over the possibility that his second son, Mojtaba, 55, might succeed him. By JNS The 85-year-old supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is gravely ill, adding to the uncertainty of an Iranian response to Israel’s weekend attack on their military installations, a report published Saturday in The New York Times said. According to the report, the most powerful political authority in the Islamic Republic is seriously ill, and there is internal turmoil over the possibility that his second son, Mojtaba, 55, might succeed him. The younger Khamenei served in the Iran–Iraq War from 1987 to 1988, and reportedly took control of the militia that was used to suppress the protests surrounding the result of the 2009 elections, which demonstrators said was rigged. His prospects for the position rose following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash earlier this year and replacement by President Masoud Pezeshkian. Khamenei’s father has held the life position for the last 35 years since his appointment in 1989, following the death of the first supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini with whom he was closely allied, making him the longest-serving head of state in the Middle East.

Seven ‘friendly’ nations demand Israel allow pro-Hamas UN agency ...	Foreign ministers from seven countries call on Israel not to pass legislation banning UNRWA. By World Israel News Staff The foreign ministries of seven different countries criticized upcoming legislation in the Israeli Knesset, aimed at barring a United Nations agency from operating inside Israel. Israel's parliament is slated to vote Monday on a bill, backed by both Coalition and Opposition lawmakers, which if passed would ban the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East from operating in Israel, and would prohibit Israeli government agencies and employees from cooperating with or contacting UNRWA. The Knesset has sanctioned UNRWA following accusations that the agency employed a number of members of terrorist organizations, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. UNRWA has further been accused of employing Gazans who took part in the invasion of Israel on October 7th along with atrocities committed against Israelis. Earlier this year, the Israel Land Authority seized UNRWA's headquarters, located in Jerusalem near the Ma'alot Dafna neighborhood, and is according to the ILA website preparing to convert the complex into a housing development. The United States and United Nations have decried Israel's measures against UNRWA, calling on Jerusalem not to take punitive steps against the agency. Over the weekend, the foreign ministries of Japan, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Australia, and South Korea issued a joint statement urging Israel not to outlaw UNRWA. 'We&#8230; express our grave concern over legislation currently under consideration by the Israeli Knesset, aimed at revoking the privileges and immunities of&#8230;UNRWA, forbidding any contact between Israeli state entities, officials and UNRWA, and prohibiting any UNRWA presence within Israel.' 'We urge the Israeli Government to abide by its international obligations, keep the reserve privileges and immunities of UNRWA untouched and live up to its responsibility to facilitate full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance in all its forms as well as the provision of sorely needed basic services to the civilian population.' On Sunday, the Im Tirtzu organization in Israel called on Knesset members to pass the law barring UNRWA from operating in Israel, rejecting pressure from abroad. 'We don't give in to pressure,' Im Tirtzu said in a statement. 'We trust the elected officials to keep their word and show courage in the face of pressure. Coalition Chairman Ofir Katz and Knesset Chairman Amir Ohana - the entirety of Israel is watching. Don't be afraid, pass the laws to remove UNRWA.' David Lammy, foreign secretary for Britain's Labour government, issued his own statement expressing 'grave concerns' regarding Israel's proposed law.

‘No more Gaza war’ – Anti-Israel hecklers interrupt Kamala Harris...	We must end that war,' says Kamala Harris, agreeing with hecklers who chanted 'No more Gaza war' during her speech at a campaign rally in Kalamazoo, Michigan. By World Israel News Staff Anti-Israel hecklers interrupted Vice President and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' speech during a campaign stop in Michigan on Saturday, demanding an immediate end to the war between Israel and the Hamas terror organization. Harris rallied supporters at an event in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Saturday, just nine days before election day, amid polling showing the battleground state a dead heat between Harris and former President Donald Trump, who leads Harris in the RealClearPolitics average of polls by a razor-thin 0.2-point margin. Former First Lady Michelle Obama appeared onstage alongside the vice president to introduce her to the crowd, welcoming her to 'Kamala-zoo' Michigan. After Harris took the podium to address the gathering, a group of anti-Israel hecklers interrupted her speech, shouting 'No more Gaza war!' One man shouting at Harris called the vice president a 'piece of sh**.' Harris responded to the chants, appearing to agree with the noisy protests. 'Listen: On the topic of Gaza, we must end that war,' said Harris. 'And we must end the war and bring the hostages home. But now I am speaking about 2024. Alright.' A dozen or so anti-Israel protesters demonstrated outside Harris' Kalamazoo rally, marching and chanting that President Joe Biden and Harris 'cannot hide.' With fifteen electoral votes, Michigan is critical to Harris' prospects in the November 5th election. Trump narrowly won the state in 2016, while Biden flipped Michigan, winning the state by a comfortable 2.7-point margin. Since October 2023, however, support for the Biden-Harris administration has faltered among Michigan's roughly half-a-million Arab Americans. Traditionally staunch Democrats, some Arab Americans have expressed frustration with the White House's policies vis-a-vis the war in Gaza, with calls by groups including the Uncommitted National Movement to impose a truce on Israel.

Arab-Israeli woman seriously injured in Hezbollah attack days aft...	Hezbollah rocket barrage on northern Israel leaves Arab-Israeli woman seriously injured, days after rocket attack by the Lebanese terror group killed two Arab-Israelis. By World Israel News Staff An Arab-Israeli woman was seriously injured in a rocket attack Sunday afternoon, after the Lebanon-based Hezbollah terror organization pummeled northern Israel with dozens of rockets. As fighting continues between IDF forces and Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon, the Iran-backed terror group launched roughly 75 projectiles towards northern Israel. At least one rocket struck the Arab town of Tamra in the western Galilee at approximately 1:00 p.m., hitting a building and sparking a fire and damaging nearby cars. A woman was seriously injured in the attack, after she was struck by shrapnel. Two days earlier, two people were killed in a Hezbollah rocket attack on another Arab town in northern Israel. On Friday, Hezbollah terrorists launched at least 30 rockets at northern Israel, the IDF said, with one rocket striking a minimart in the Arab town of Majd al-Krum, located just four miles northeast of Tamra. Two people were critically injured in the attack, with both succumbing to their injuries. The victims killed in the attack were identified as 19-year-old Arjwan Manaa, and 21-year-old Hassan Suad. Both were in the minimart at the time of the attack, with Manaa working as a cashier, while Suad was a customer. In a separate rocket attack, at least six IDF soldiers were injured when a projectile launched by Hezbollah struck near the town of Shomera in the western Galilee. The victims were listed in moderate and light condition.

Truck slams into bus stop killing one and injuring dozens of pedestrians north of Tel Aviv outside an IDF base, leaving victims trapped under vehicle. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Dozens of pedestrians were injured and one killed in a terrorist ramming attack in central Israel Sunday morning, when a truck slammed into a bus stop at a junction not far from an Israeli military base. The attack occurred at around 10:00 a.m. Israel time, when a truck travelling down Aharon Yariv Boulevard in the central Israeli city of Ramat HaSharon rammed a bus as passengers were getting off, and then continued on a struck a bus stop adjacent to a Cinema City movie theater by Glilot Junction, where an IDF base is located. At least 35 people were injured in the attack, one of them fatally. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the injured and evacuate them to local hospitals. According to an MDA spokesperson, 10 victims have been evacuated to Ichilov Medical Center in Tel Aviv, including four people in serious condition, two in moderate condition, and four in light condition. Fourteen others have been evacuated to Petah Tikva's Beilinson Medical Center, MDA added. MDA has reported that five victims are in serious condition, with seven in moderate condition and the rest listed in light condition. One seriously injured victim was declared dead by doctors after being evacuated to the hospital. United Hatzalah volunteer EMT Aharon Yaakobson, who was nearby and arrived first at the scene, paramedic Yaron Schiff, and EMTs Eliyah Tubul and Yair Porush reported that some of the victims were trapped underneath the terrorist's truck. 'It was a difficult scene with a truck, a bus, and pedestrians. We provided initial treatment at the scene to over 20 people (at this stage) who sustained varying degrees of injuries.' 'Some of them were rescued by fire crews in serious condition after being trapped under the truck. Members of United Hatzalah's Psychotrauma and Crisis Response Unit also provided assistance at the scene to people who suffered from emotional shock.' Authorities say the terrorist was shot and killed during the attack. He has been identified as Rami Nasrallah Natour, an Israeli Arab from the Arab Israeli town of Qalansawe, east of Netanya.

Israeli reservists kill 3 Hezbollah terrorists in gun battle in southern Lebanon, while 4 soldiers were killed, with 14 more wounded. By Pesach Benson, TPS Four Israeli soldiers were killed and another 14 injured in a battle with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces said on Sunday. According to the IDF, reservists from the 8207th Battalion engaged Hezbollah terrorists in an unspecified southern Lebanese village. During an exchange of fire, three of the terrorists were killed. The army is investigating the details of the incident. The fallen soldiers were identified as 29-year-old platoon commander Cpt. (res.) Amit Chayut; 36-year-old deputy platoon commander Maj. (res.) Eliav Amram Abitbol; the battalion’s rabbi, 43-year-old Cpt. (res.) Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg; and 30-year-old Master Sgt. (res.) Gilad Elmaliach, 30. Of the 14 injured, five were listed in serious condition. Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli army disclosed that soldiers uncovered Hezbollah weapons buried near the border fence while airstrikes on the terror group’s stronghold in Beirut’s Dahiya district targeted weapons warehouses and factories.

Terrorist attack foiled near entrance to Jerusalem	On the heels of major ramming attack in central Israel that left dozens injured, second attack reported outside Jerusalem. By World Israel News Staff A Palestinian Arab terrorist was shot and killed after he attempted to run down and stab a group of Israeli soldiers near the northern entrance to Jerusalem on Sunday, an Israeli military spokesperson said. The abortive attack occurred just before 1:00 p.m. Sunday afternoon, while a group of IDF soldiers were conducting a counter-terror operation in the town of Hizme, just north of the Jerusalem neighborhood of Pisgat Ze'ev. During the attack, a terrorist driving towards a group of soldiers accelerated and attempted to run the soldiers down. After failing to hit any of the soldiers, the terrorist exited his vehicle, drew a knife, and ran towards the soldiers, attempting to stab them. The soldiers opened fire on the terrorist as he approached them, fatally wounding him. No Israeli security personnel were injured during the incident. The attack came just hours after a terrorist driving a truck rammed into a bus and an adjacent bus stop in the central Israeli city of Ramat HaSharon, near a Cinema City movie theater. At least 35 people were injured in the attack, including ten listed in serious condition, one of whom who is said to have suffered life-threatening injuries.

Why did an Russian government plane secretly land in Israel?	Hamas recently signaled that it would prioritize releasing two hostages with Russian citizenship still held in the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff A Russian government plane landed in Israel last Thursday, without announcements from either Moscow or Jerusalem, triggering questions about Russia's role in negotiations with the Hamas terror group and Iran. The plane landed last Thursday at Ben-Gurion Airport, on the last day of the Sukkot holiday, and no official explanation or information were provided regarding the likely visit by a Russian government delegation. Israeli media officials declined to answer media queries regarding the visit. Notably, Hezbollah ceased its virtually non-stop rocket and missile fire and drone launches during the entire time that the Russian plane was on the ground in Israel. The terror group then resumed its aerial bombardment once the plane had taken off to return to Moscow and was out of Israeli airspace. 'For several weeks, Russia has been trying to mediate between Iran and Israel. This can be understood from Putin's words, from meetings between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Bogdanov and the Israeli Ambassador to Russia,' Alex Tenzer, a Russian media expert, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'Russia is trying to protect its influence in the Middle East, which is weakening day by day due to the weakening of Iran.' In December 2023, three Israeli hostages with Russian citizenship were released by Hamas, in a deal between the terror group and Russia. That deal was completely independent of a hostage deal between the Israeli government and Hamas, which saw the return of dozens of captives kidnapped on October 7th, alongside with thousands of Palestinian terrorists from Israeli prisons. Last week, the deputy head of the Hamas politburo, Musa Abu Marzouk, was hosted by the Kremlin to discuss a potential hostage deal. Abu Marzouk, who is classified by the U.S. government as a 'specially designated global terrorist,' said that Hamas was willing to have Russia act as a negotiator. Hamas would 'prioritize releasing the two Russian citizen hostages' still held in the Strip, even before the release of women or injured captives, Abu Marzouk told Russian media.

Unique ‘Vulcan’ anti-drone cannon deployed in north	The cannon can reportedly shoot a staggering 6,000 rounds in just one minute, and has six 20mm barrels. By World Israel News Staff Hezbollah terrorists have launched hundreds of explosive drones at Israeli communities and military targets over the past year of fighting. Drones have proved a particularly tricky target for Israel's Iron Dome air defense system to intercept, as the UAVs fly at low altitudes - oftentimes, literally under the radar. Earlier in October, an explosive drone launched by Hezbollah struck Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea, underscoring the threat posed by this new type of warfare. Just days before that incident, a suicide UAV struck a Golani Brigade training base in northern Israel, killing four soldiers. But according to reports, Israel has now deployed a new weapon aimed at curbing the Hezbollah drone threat. The M61 Vulcan cannon is now operational along Israel's northern border, according to Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv. The cannon can reportedly shoot a staggering 6,000 rounds in just one minute, and has six 20mm barrels. While this particular cannon was manufactured by the Israeli Tamar Group, an older version of the M61 Vulcan was originally provided to Israel by the U.S. during the 1967 Yom Kippur War. However, Israel only began using the cannon during the 1982 First Lebanon War. According to Ma'ariv, the efficacy of the Vulcan cannon is unclear. Due to the hilly terrain of the northern border region, some IDF officials are concerned that the weapon may not be able to effectively shoot down drones. Several weeks ago, the Ministry of Defense issued an unusual statement calling on Israeli weapons manufacturers and technology companies to create or suggest a solution that can improve the IDF's ability to intercept UAVs. 'The Israel Air Force has not built a proper force to deal with drone threats on such a large scale, despite the significant successes in the North,' a senior reserve officer recently told Walla. 'It’s a fundamental issue. We ended up in a situation where four fighter jets and a missile ship – at best – are chasing one drone.'

CIA chief leads first ceasefire summit in months in bid to reboot...	With time running out for the Biden administration before next month's election, CIA Director William Burns set to lead first high-level ceasefire talks in months, hoping to reach breakthrough on hostage deal. By World Israel News Staff For the first time in months, officials involved in talks aimed at reaching a hostage deal and ceasefire in the Gaza Strip are set to gather for a summit in Doha, Qatar in a bid to reboot talks which have been deadlocked for much of the year. CIA Director William Burns, who is leading the American delegation, is set to lead the renewed hostage deal negotiations, the first high-level talks since August. Time is running out for the Biden administration to reach a breakthrough towards a deal prior to election day next Tuesday, or a final deal before inauguration day next January 20th. Since early on in Israel's war with Hamas, the White House has sought to secure the release of hostages abducted by Gaza terrorists on October 7th, as well as to achieve a lasting truce in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli delegation, headed by Mossad chief David Barnea, is expected to unveil a new plan, offering a framework for a deal drafted in conjunction with Qatari and Egyptian interlocutors. The summit comes following a whirlwind tour of the Middle East by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met with leaders from Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar last week. Blinken's Mideast trip and Sunday's summit come following the assassinations of high-level Hamas leaders, including politburo chief Yahya Sinwar. Following the killing of Sinwar, who staunchly opposed any concessions in hostage deal talks, the Biden administration resumed efforts to bring Hamas back to the negotiating table. However, it is unclear if Burns will continue to push President Joe Biden's framework for a deal, laid out by the president in May when he proposed a three-phase agreement - or formally embrace the new plan drafted by Israel, Egypt, and Qatar, with input from the U.S. Israel has sought to shift talks from a narrow focus on the Gaza war to include a comprehensive ceasefire with both Hamas and Hezbollah - a move which could then increase pressure by Hezbollah and Iran on Hamas to make concessions to Israel.

By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF destroyed Iran's most advanced anti-missile systems among the air defenses it hit in its overnight air attack Saturday, leaving several major energy sites, a missile base, a port and Tehran’s airport defenseless, The New York Times reported Sunday. Citing unnamed Israeli officials, the paper said that three S-300 systems supplied by Russia and other radar systems were 'severely damaged and rendered inoperative.' A fourth one had been demolished in the single strike Israel had delivered in April after Iran fired some 300 cruise and ballistic missiles and drones at the Jewish state in an attack that failed to do more than cause some minor damage and injured a Bedouin girl. The S-300 is Russia’s second-most powerful air defense system; it did not sell any of its top-of-the-line S-400s to the Islamic Republic. The protective systems nailed by the three waves of Israeli jets included those near the Bandar Imam Khomeini port and Iran’s largest petrochemical complex of the same name, which is adjacent to it, Iranian officials told the paper. The airstrike also took out the air defense around Iran’s largest oil refinery, which produces 360,000 barrels a day. A gas refinery, the Malad missile base near the capital, and Tehran’s international airport have also been denuded of their most advanced shields. In all, some 140 IAF jets and UAVs struck throughout several provinces, some deep in the country. Three important missile manufacturing facilities run by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, launch sites, and vital components of Iran’s ballistic missile program were all targeted in a careful mission that stuck to military sites. The United States had warned Israel against hitting the mullahcracy’s economic lifeline – its gas and oil fields – or its nuclear facilities, believing Tehran’s many warnings that such attacks could cause a regional war. Upon concluding its successful mission, the IDF in turn warned Tehran Saturday that if it decides to escalate matters, it has shown its capabilities and stands ready to attack again. The Iranians may have gotten the point. 'Israel is sending a clear message to us,' said Hamid Hosseini, an expert on Iran’s oil and gas industry and a member of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce. 'This can have very serious economic consequences for Iran, and now that we understand the stakes we need to act wise and not continue the tensions.' The strike Saturday was Israel’s response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack on the Jewish state earlier this month which caused hundreds of millions of shekels in damages to homes, businesses, and managed to hit certain military bases, although not critically.

Sid Rosenberg’s explosive trip to Israel: What you didn’t hear	New York's #1 radio broadcaster's message is clear: Israel’s future hangs in the balance, and we must stand with our greatest ally now, more than ever. By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News On the one-year anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attacks, Sid Rosenberg returned to Israel—not merely as New York's #1 radio broadcaster, but as a man on a mission. This trip wasn’t about another news cycle; it was about witnessing firsthand the daily fight for survival in a nation under siege. With exclusive interviews from two of the world’s most prominent leaders—former President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—Rosenberg brought home a message that Americans need to hear: the fight for Israel’s survival is more critical than ever, and it demands unwavering U.S. support. Trump’s Uncompromising Support for Israel In his interview with Rosenberg, Donald Trump reminded his audience why his administration’s support for Israel was unparalleled. 'No one fought for Israel like I did,' Trump stated, citing his relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and the Abraham Accords, which realigned the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. His frustration with the current administration’s lackluster Middle East policy was palpable. For Rosenberg’s predominantly pro-Israel and conservative listeners, Trump’s words were a powerful call for renewed U.S. leadership in the region. Netanyahu’s Stark Warning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu didn’t mince words about the existential threats facing Israel. 'The situation is far worse than we expected,' Rosenberg reflected after his interview. With Hamas attacking from the south and Hezbollah amassing in the north, Israel is surrounded by enemies committed to its destruction. Netanyahu emphasized that while Israel is more than capable of defending itself, it cannot do so alone. Strong ties with the U.S. are not just an option—they are a necessity for Israel’s survival. Sderot: A Glimpse of Life Under Fire The geopolitical discussions with Trump and Netanyahu were critical, but what hit closest to home for Rosenberg was the experience of being in Sderot, a town constantly under threat from Hamas rockets. Just moments before going on air, explosions rocked the area, followed by sirens. Rosenberg was rushed to a bomb shelter by a young woman named Gitit, who broke down in tears as she recounted the horrors of October 7. 'These people go through this every day,' Rosenberg later reflected. Gitit’s story of survival, of barely escaping terrorists who attempted to storm her home, was a chilling reminder of the daily terror Israelis face. The Fight Against Global Antisemitism: A Personal Struggle But Rosenberg’s trip wasn’t just about Israel’s external threats. His phone call with his daughter Ava, who is facing rampant antisemitism while studying at Cardiff University in the UK, underscored the broader, global fight against Jew-hatred. Doxxing, harassment, and threats have become the norm for Jewish students like Ava, simply because of their identity. 'Ava, it’s all connected,' Rosenberg told her. The rise in antisemitism globally is a dangerous echo of the hatred Israel faces, and it is a fight that must be fought on all fronts. A Personal Connection with Israel’s Leaders Rosenberg’s trip wasn’t just about the big headlines; it was filled with personal moments, too. On Thursday night, Rosenberg joined the Falic family for prayers at the Western Wall, alongside Sara Netanyahu. It was a spiritual experience that brought Rosenberg closer to the heart of Israeli society, as tens of thousands gathered in prayer. Later, Rosenberg spent time with Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Though they disagree politically, both share an unwavering love for Israel. Herzog, in his own words, described Rosenberg as 'a cool guy' during their Yom Kippur meeting—an acknowledgment of Rosenberg’s unique role in bringing the stories of Israel’s fight to a global audience. A New Year, a Renewed Purpose On Yom Kippur, Rosenberg attended services in Efrat led by the dynamic Rabbi Shlomo Katz, where prayers were not solemn and silent, but full of joy, song, and dancing. It was a striking contrast to the typical Yom Kippur experience in America—here, Rosenberg witnessed a community that revels in its Jewish identity, full of energy and love for their faith. As the fast ended, Rosenberg gathered with Bibi and Sara Netanyahu for a celebratory meal. It was a casual, yet profound moment. Bibi took a personal interest in Rosenberg’s work, commending him for his worldwide reach and calling him 'a Champion for our People.' As Rosenberg reflected on the evening, he was filled with awe for the resilience of Israel’s leaders and the strength of its people. A Call to Action: The Fight for Israel is the Fight for Freedom The trip ended with a powerful realization: Israel’s fight is not just for its own survival—it’s a fight for the values we hold dear. Freedom, democracy, and the rule of law are all at stake. As Rosenberg concluded, 'We’re going to win, because we have to win.' This is a battle that demands the attention of every American who values liberty. With leaders like Trump and Netanyahu standing strong, the path forward is clear, but it will require steadfast commitment—from Israel and from its allies. November 5th will be a pivotal moment not only for America but for Israel and the world. Sid Rosenberg’s message is clear: Israel’s future hangs in the balance, and we must stand with our greatest ally now, more than ever.

Netanyahu, limited Iran attack failed the Israeli people – Journa...	Addressing Netanyahu, Riklin wrote that 'in the face of the war against Iran, you have not answered the call of the hour.' By World Israel News Staff A right-wing commentator and journalist, who is usually a staunch supporter of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, slammed the premier over what he said was a failure to deter Iran with Saturday's airstrikes. Shimon Riklin, a Channel 14 presenter who hosts The Patriots, one of the highest-rated news programs on Israeli television, wrote on social media platform X that the retaliatory attack on Iran represented a surrender to American pressure on Netanyahu's end. 'When the war began [on October 7th], Israel rose to the occasion. Civilian, soldiers, and police officers went to battle. Thousands were killed and wounded. Tens of thousands more lost their places of employment, studies, and plans' for the future,' Riklin wrote. Addressing Netanyahu, Riklin wrote that 'in the face of the war against Iran, you have not answered the call of the hour.' By not striking Israel's nuclear development sites, Netanyahu 'squandered a historic opportunity, the importance of which you have [previously] stressed to the public.' 'A great leader is not judged by his length of time in office, but the critical decisions he makes,' Riklin continued. The journalist said he believed that Netanyahu had folded under pressure from the Biden administration to avoid striking Iran's nuclear and oil sites. 'At the moment when the people of Israel needed you to rise to the occasion, we heard you obeying - in English - a president who's almost out of office,' he wrote. 'You now owe the people of Israel an explanation. Why did you hesitate and miss the opportunity?' Riklin also referred to the October 1 Iranian attack, which saw Tehran shoot nearly 200 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State. He also mentioned the drone attack on Netanyahu's Ceasarea residence, which was likely ordered by Iran but carried out by Hezbollah. 'How many more times should Iran shoot at us and you personally?' Riklin asked. He asked when Netanyahu will 'have the courage to react to the threat that you have rightly defined as existential.'

Poll: Inflation trumps Middle East crisis for American voters	Inflation dominates voter concerns at 39%, with immigration (35%) and the economy (29%) rounding out the top three priorities. By Jewish Breaking News A comprehensive new Harvard University and Harris Poll survey reveals that while American support for Israel remains strong, voters are overwhelmingly focused on domestic concerns ahead of the upcoming election. The poll, which surveyed 3,145 registered voters including nearly 900 in battleground states, shows inflation dominating voter concerns at 39%, with immigration (35%) and the economy (29%) rounding out the top three priorities. Strikingly, the Israel-Hamas conflict ranks a distant 15th at just 6%, while concerns about antisemitism barely register at 2%. Despite the war’s low ranking in voter priorities, support for Israel remains strong at 81%. However, President Joe Biden’s handling of the situation garners only 35% approval, which could prove troubling for his reelection chances in November. In a head-to-head comparison on managing the conflict, former President Donald Trump edges out President Biden 47% to 37%, with 16% undecided. Political analysts note that with 62% of Americans following the conflict closely, and 73% viewing Iran as a regional sponsor of terror, while the Israel-Hamas war may not be driving voting decisions, it remains a significant factor in shaping American views of the Middle East. The survey also reveals interesting insights into Americans’ institutional trust. In a ranking of 19 countries, institutions, activist groups, and media companies, Israel placed fifth with 48% favorability. This puts it ahead of major media outlets like Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC, as well as political movements including Black Lives Matter and MAGA Republicans. Traditional institutions like the military, police, and the FBI ranked higher than Israel, while campus protesters, China, and the Palestinian Authority ranked lower.

‘Grave mistake’ or ‘good beginning’? Israeli politicians on scope...	Yair Lapid, leader of the opposition, wrote on Saturday on his X account that Iran should have 'paid a much heavier price.' By Anna Epshtein, TPS The Israeli attack in Iran has drawn both criticism and applause at home from across the political spectrum. Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir, who criticized Israel’s restrained response to the Iranian attack in April, wrote a more positive post on his X account this time, saying that the strike 'was a good beginning in order to target Iran’s strategic assets, which needs to be the next phase.' He added, 'We have a historic duty to remove the Iranian threat.' The attack was also praised by opposition leader Yair Golan, head of the Israeli Labor Party, for 'harming Iran’s defensive and offensive capabilities without dragging us into a war of attrition.' However, the strike was criticized for not inflicting serious damage to either Iranian economics by striking oil reserves or to Iran’s nuclear program. Yair Lapid, leader of the opposition, wrote on Saturday on his X account that Iran should have 'paid a much heavier price' and that 'the decision not to attack strategic and economic targets in Iran was wrong.' Tally Gotliv, a member of the Knesset from Netanyahu’s governing Likud party, used even stronger words, saying that 'Not striking Iran’s nuclear facilities will be a cause for regret for generations. Not striking Iran’s oil reserves is a grave mistake.' She added, 'Unfortunately, this is submission to the Biden administration which doesn’t think for a moment about Israel’s interests.' On Saturday, Israel struck a number of military targets in Iran in response to the Iranian attack on October 1. The Israeli attack in the early hours of Saturday morning was carried out by air force, striking, among other targets, missile manufacturing facilities. The Prime Minister’s office issued a denial of Hebrew media report arguing that Israel initially planned to strike Iran’s oil and natural gas facilities, but changed its plan after persistent US pressure. 'Israel chose the targets ahead of time, based on its national interests,' said the PMO, 'and not based on American directives.' 'Israel did not notify Iran before the attack — not about the timing, not about the targets, and not about the scale of the attack,' said another statement from the Prime Minister’s office.

Analysts said Russia’s involvement in the attacks is further indication of its efforts to stoke instability in the Middle East and divert Western attention from the conflict in Ukraine. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Russia provided satellite targeting data to the Houthis in Yemen, aiding the Iran-backed terrorist group’s missile and drone attacks on Western ships in the Red Sea this year, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The Houthis used the targeting data, which was funneled through members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps stationed in Yemen, to coordinate and expand strikes on ships along the vital global trade route, according to an individual familiar with the matter and two European defense officials. The Houthis began targeting Western ships in the Red Sea late last year in retaliation for Israel’s war against Hamas. Since then, the terrorists have attacked over 100 vessels, sinking two and hijacking another, the Journal reported. Analysts said Russia’s involvement in the attacks is further indication of its efforts to stoke instability in the Middle East and divert Western attention from the conflict in Ukraine. 'For Russia, any flare up anywhere is good news, because it takes the world’s attention further away from Ukraine and the U.S. needs to commit resources—Patriot systems or artillery shells—and with the Middle East in play, it’s clear where the U.S. will choose,' said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Berlin-based Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. The Houthi attacks have severely disrupted global trade, forcing many ships to instead go around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. Tanker traffic through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, which links the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, dropped by 77 percent in August compared to last October, according to maritime-intelligence company Windward. In December, the United States spearheaded a naval coalition to escort ships in the region, spending around $1 billion by April on ammunition to counter Houthi drones and missiles. Houthi terrorists also purchased weapons from Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was released by the Biden-Harris administration in exchange for U.S. basketball player Brittney Griner, the Journal reported this month.

Senate Republicans threaten UN funding if global body sidelines I...	The United States is the largest contributor to the world body, giving it and its agencies $18 billion in 2022—about one-third of the total U.N. budget. By Andrew Bernard, JNS Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and 27 other Republican senators introduced legislation on Tuesday that would cut off U.S. funding to the United Nations and its subsidiary agencies if they downgrade Israel’s status. 'Reports indicate that the Palestinian Authority will attempt to downgrade Israel’s status at the United Nations' following a U.N. General Assembly vote in May, the 28 senators wrote. That vote saw Palestinians gain new rights within their existing non-member 'permanent observer' status, which is short of full U.N. membership. 'Any attempt to alter Israel’s status at the United Nations is clearly antisemitic,' Risch stated. 'That said, if the U.N. member states allow the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization to downgrade Israel’s status at the U.N., the U.S. must stop supporting the U.N. system, as it would clearly be beyond repair.' Risch added that he is 'disgusted that this outrageous idea has even been discussed and will do all we can to ensure any changes to Israel’s status will come with consequences.' Titled the 'Stand with Israel Act,' the bill would forbid the federal government from disbursing funds to 'the United Nations or any of its funds, programs, specialized agencies or other related entities' if the global body 'expels, downgrades or suspends membership, or otherwise restricts the participation of Israel.' The United States is the largest contributor to the world body, giving it and its agencies $18 billion in 2022—about one-third of the total U.N. budget. Those contributions are mandatory for members of the U.N. General Assembly under the global body’s 'assessed contributions' system. Countries that fall into arrears on paying their contributions are stripped of their vote in the General Assembly. Objections are longstanding in Washington to paying for the budget in Turtle Bay. In 1982, then-Secretary of State George Schultz threatened U.S. withdrawal from any U.N. body that did not seat Israel. The United States nearly lost its General Assembly vote in a budget dispute in 1999. Former president Donald Trump cut off funding to the U.N. Palestinian aid agency, UNRWA, in 2018 and negotiated a lower overall U.N. budget in 2017. U.S. President Joe Biden restored funding to UNRWA before suspending it again in March after Israel accused employees of participating directly in the Hamas terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Several of the senators co-sponsoring the Stand with Israel Act said Jew-hatred at the United Nations undermines the agency’s effectiveness. 'A move to downgrade Israel’s status at the United Nations would be a new low, even for an organization that is as rife with antisemites as the United Nations,' stated Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). 'Unfortunately, antisemitism has pervaded the United Nations for decades and discredits the U.N. mission,' stated Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska). 'It must end.' Under existing U.S. law, Washington must cut off funding to the United Nations or any of its subsidiaries if the Palestinians are granted full membership outside of a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Reps. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) and Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) introduced companion legislation to the Senate act in the House in August with bipartisan support.

Biden-Harris admin sued for stonewalling investigation into Iran-...	In its lawsuit, the watchdog group accused the Defense Department of intentionally slow-rolling its request for internal documents and communications. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon A government watchdog group is suing the Biden-Harris administration for obstructing a yearlong investigation into senior Pentagon employee Ariane Tabatabai, the outed member of a secretive pro-Iran influence group operated by the hardline regime’s government. America First Legal, a nonprofit oversight group run by former Trump administration officials, filed its lawsuit against the Pentagon on Tuesday, accusing the agency of stonewalling its probe into Tabatabai and other senior U.S. officials for the past year, according to a copy of the filing obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The organization originally requested a trove of internal documents from the Pentagon and State Department as part of an investigation into Tabatabai’s relations with a host of pro-Tehran advocates, including one of her close associates, former Iran envoy Robert Malley, who is under investigation for mishandling classified information. The probe was launched amid mounting concerns that Tabatabai, Malley, and other senior Biden-Harris officials were conducting back-channel diplomacy with Iran, hoping to strengthen relations with the hardline regime. The Biden-Harris administration appears to be unbothered by those concerns. Tabatabai was recently promoted to deputy assistant secretary of defense within Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's office, where she leads its force education and training division. She was offered the position last month, shortly before the explosive leak of classified U.S. intelligence on Israel’s preparations for an upcoming strike on Iran. In addition to the lawsuit, America First Legal provided the Free Beacon with a cache of newly filed Freedom of Information Act Requests seeking details about who may have leaked that intelligence. The leak, which included top-secret documents from the U.S. intelligence community, is believed to have been motivated by a desire to handicap the Jewish state ahead of November’s election. Together, the joint lawsuit and FOIA campaign could help unearth previously unknown details about the Biden-Harris administration’s private discussions on Iran and Israel, the ongoing Middle East conflict, and behind-the-scenes efforts to restart diplomacy with Tehran during the Democratic administration’s four years in office. 'The Biden-Harris administration has appointed pro-Iranian apologists and influence agents to sensitive positions in the departments of defense and state,' said Reed Rubinstein, America First Legal’s senior vice president. 'Our lawsuit and most recent round of investigative demands should shine useful light on the role that these individuals may have played in leaking or sharing U.S. intelligence with the mullahs.' In its lawsuit, the watchdog group accused the Defense Department of intentionally slow-rolling its request for internal documents and communications, including encrypted text messages, sent between Malley, Tabatabai, and any individual inside the Iranian government. The initial request for this information was sent in October 2023, just after it was revealed that Malley had been suspended from his post amid a probe into his handling of classified information. It also followed reports that Tabatabai, a former State Department employee who now works on classified matters at the Pentagon, served as a member of the Iran Experts Initiative, a vast influence network created by Iran’s government and alleged to include two other Malley associates. The watchdog group’s search parameters included the keywords 'Robert Malley,' 'IEI,' 'Hamas,' 'Hezbollah,' 'Iran,' 'Zionist,' 'clearance,' and 'TS/SCI,' referring to information marked classified. The Pentagon was legally mandated to respond within 20 days to the organization’s FOIA request but blew past this deadline, claiming that a 'complex processing queue' and 'unusual circumstances' prevented it from producing the relevant documents, according to emails exchanged between the Defense Department and American First Legal in 2023. In its latest batch of FOIA requests, meanwhile, American First Legal petitioned the Pentagon, Office of Director of National Intelligence, State Department, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to hand over documents detailing all internal communications officials have engaged in since the classified intelligence pertaining to Israel became public. The top-secret intelligence originally appeared on a pro-Iran Telegram channel before spreading online, reportedly forcing Israel to delay its attack on Iran to stop it from making defensive preparations. While the identity of the leaker or leakers is unknown, outside groups like America First Legal suspect that any number of Biden-Harris administration figures could have released the information to thwart Israel’s counterstrike, payback for Tehran’s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack on the country. The Pentagon denied this week that Tabatabai was involved in the leak or is a person of interest in the investigation. America First Legal is asking that each agency release all records related to 'Iran,' 'Israel,' 'leak,' 'investigation,' and 'Telegram'—a broad request that could shine light on the administration’s private reaction to the dissemination of highly classified documents.

Israel strikes inside Iran, destroys ‘vital components’ of ballis...	The targets included missile and drone manufacturing facilities and launch sites, as well as air-defense batteries. By Jewish News Syndicate Israeli Air Force fighter jets conducted precision strikes on military targets in Iran overnight Friday, nearly one month after Tehran launched a massive ballistic-missile attack on the Jewish state. According to the Israel Defense Forces, dozens of aircraft, including refuelers and spy planes, conducted 'waves' of attacks over the course of a few hours across several regions of Iran, located some 1,600 kilometers from Israel. The targets included missile and drone manufacturing facilities and launch sites, as well as air-defense batteries. The facilities destroyed were vital components of Iran's ballistic missile program, Walla cited three anonymous Israeli sources as saying. The state-run SANA news outlet reported simultaneous Israeli strikes against military targets across central and southern Syria, amid Tehran’s decades-long effort to entrench itself in that country. The IDF named the operation 'Days of Repentance.' 'I can now confirm that we have concluded the Israeli response to Iran’s attacks against Israel. We conducted targeted and precise strikes on military targets in Iran—thwarting immediate threats to the State of Israel,' said IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. 'The Israel Defense Forces has fulfilled its mission. If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond. Our message is clear: All those who threaten the State of Israel and seek to drag the region into wider escalation will pay a heavy price,' Hagari continued. 'We demonstrated today that we have both the capability and the resolve to act decisively, and we are prepared—on offense and defense—to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel,' he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the overnight attack from the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, where he was later joined by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Mossad head David Barnea and Israel Security Agency leader Ronen Bar. 'The regime in Iran and its regional proxies have been relentlessly attacking Israel since [Hamas’s] Oct. 7th [massacre of 1,200 people]—on seven fronts—including direct attacks from Iranian soil,' the IDF said. 'Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and duty to respond.' The military was conducting an ongoing situation assessment, and there were no immediate changes to Home Front Command directives for civilians. Iran claimed to have successfully repelled the Israeli offensive, while ceding that 'limited damage' was caused to various sites. The Iranian military said that Israel had struck in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam. The Islamic Republic was prepared to retaliate to the 'aggression,' according to the country’s semi-official Tasnim news agency. 'There is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes,' the outlet quoted sources as saying. The Biden administration was informed of the strikes in advance, but the United States did not directly participate in the action. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett described the development as 'an exercise of self-defense and in response to Iran’s ballistic-missile attack against Israel on Oct. 1.' A senior administration official subsequently said that the attack 'should be the end of the direct military exchange between Israel and Iran. 'Should Iran choose to respond, we’re fully prepared to defend Israel and support Israel, and there will be consequences,' added the official. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin overnight Friday held a call with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, although no readout was provided. U.S. President Joe Biden previously urged Jerusalem to forgo attacking Iranian nuclear sites and oil fields, instead pressing for a small-scale operation. 'No administration has helped Israel more than I have—none, none, none. I think Bibi should remember that,' said the president, using Netanyahu’s nickname. By contrast, former president Donald Trump suggested that Iran’s nuclear infrastructure was fair game. 'I think he’s got that one wrong,' the Republican presidential candidate said of Biden. 'Isn’t that what you’re supposed to hit? I mean, it’s the biggest risk we have, nuclear weapons. … The answer should have been: Hit the nuclear first, and worry about the rest later.' Last week, Netanyahu emphasized that the Iranian targets chosen would be 'based on Israel’s national security needs.' Reports later suggested he had softened his stance in favor of a more limited strike due to Washington’s decision to deploy to Israel a THAAD advanced aerial defense system, and to avoid the perception of political interference in the upcoming U.S election. On Oct. 1, Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, forcing the entire civilian population of the Jewish state into bomb shelters. The targets of the Iranian attack were believed to be three Israeli Air Force bases, as well as an IDF military intelligence headquarters just north of Tel Aviv. In April, Iran conducted its first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory, launching some 300 missiles and drones, the vast majority of which were shot down in a multinational effort. The direct military confrontations come on the backdrop of Israel’s ongoing wars against Iranian terror proxies Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas's top negotiator, chided Israel for continuing to misread the group and said the conflict could continue for months, if not years. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas has rejected a deal put forward by Mossad chief David Barnea that would allow immunity and safe passage for Hamas terrorists in exchange for the hostages in Gaza, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. David Barnea met with Egyptian officials earlier this week, but Hamas rejected the proposal. Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas's top negotiator, chided Israel for continuing to misread the group and said the conflict could continue for months, if not years. According to the Qatari news organization, the Hamas official called for an end to what he termed the 'genocide' in northern Gaza before any agreement could be reached to release hostages. Despite Hamas's rejection of the proposal, Barnea is expected to meet with CIA Director William Burns for the first time in two months on Sunday in Doha, Qatar. A source told the Jerusalem Post that Barnea has 'been working under the radar' on a new deal 'with the Qataris, the Americans, and the Egyptians.' The renewed push for a hostage deal comes after a week of meetings between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Israeli and Arab officials. Blinken flew to the Middle East following the news of Israel's killing of Hamas leader and October 7th mastermind Yahya Sinwar. A version of the 'safe passage' in exchange for hostages proposal was offered in September, before Sinwar's death. In an interview with Bloomberg, Hirsch said, 'I'm ready to provide safe passage to Sinwar, his family, whoever wants to join him. We want the hostages back. We want demilitarization, de-radicalization of course — a new system that will manage Gaza,' he stated. 'In parallel, I must work on plans B, C, and D because I must bring the hostages back home. The clock is ticking; the hostages do not have time,' Hirsch added.

Israel gave Iran advance warning before attack – report	Israel reportedly informed Iran which targets would be hit and urging Tehran not to respond. By Jewish Breaking News Israel warned Iran through multiple diplomatic channels before launching its retaliatory strikes early Saturday, making clear which targets would be hit and urging Tehran not to respond, sources familiar with the communications tell Axios. Delivered through several intermediaries including Dutch Foreign Minister Casper Veldhoven, the message came with a stark warning: any Iranian retaliation, especially if resulting in Israeli civilian casualties, would trigger an even more severe response from the IDF. Iran’s Foreign Ministry responded to the strikes by invoking its right to self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, condemning what it called 'a clear violation of international law.' The ministry vowed to 'employ all physical and spiritual capabilities' to protect Iranian interests and security, while calling for international intervention against Israel’s 'genocide' in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel’s operation reportedly unfolded in three precise waves. Initial strikes disabled Iranian air defense systems, followed by attacks on missile and drone bases across Tehran, Karaj, Isfahan, and Shiraz regions. The mission, involving dozens of Israeli aircraft and reaching targets 1,600 kilometers away, marked the first time Israel immediately acknowledged such a deep-strike operation into Iranian territory. While Iran claimed successful interceptions, Israeli officials dismissed these assertions, declaring all mission objectives achieved by 6 a.m. US officials say they expect Iran to respond to the Israeli attack in the coming days but keep its response measured to avoid further escalation. 'It is our aim to accelerate diplomacy and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region. We urge Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation,' said National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett.

IDF discovers Hezbollah tunnel and plans to launch an Oct 7th-sty...	At the beginning of Israel's ground operation in Lebanon, the IDF discovered a detailed Hezbollah plan for an October 7th style invasion of Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a private residence close to the Israeli border, IDF soldiers in Lebanon discovered a shaft leading to a 1.5-kilometer tunnel that was designed to launch an October 7th-style invasion into Israel. The tunnel, with the capacity to hold hundreds of terrorists, was uncovered last week by the IDF’s Yahalom Unit along with plans to carry out an invasion. Before blowing up the tunnel, Brig.-Gen. Guy Levy, who heads the IDF’s 98th Division, led journalists into the belly of the extensive tunnel. 'We are at a central intersection of this tunnel,' which is also a 'very significant underground combat compound,' Levy said as he stood at the shaft. 'The enemy built this over many years to prepare to attack Israel,' he said. 'It can hold hundreds of terrorists for an extended stay of weeks' and extends 'hundreds of meters.' On October 1st, when the IDF began its operation in southern Lebanon, it declassified a document it discovered in enemy territory describing a Hezbollah operation to attack Israel called 'Conquer the Galilee.' The IDF has invited journalists into the tunnel to document and publicize information about a long-planned attack that the military operation in Lebanon was designed to prevent. The IDF fought a 48-hour battle to capture the village with the home that housed the shaft of the large tunnel. Inside the tunnel was a storage room with rifles, RPK machine guns, Kornet anti-tank missiles, and boxes of ammunition, and many of the items were supplied by Iran. In addition, there was food, medical supplies, bathrooms, and cots for terrorists to stay and prepare for the invasion. 'I feel like I have entered the belly of the enemy, taken when they built over years,' said Lt.-Col. Yoni HaCohen.Finding this tunnel and destroying it, he said, 'is a great success.'

5 Things to know about Israel’s retaliatory attack on Iran	The Israeli military said its 'precise and targeted strikes' hit missile air defense systems and 'aerial capabilities' as well as missile manufacturing facilities. By Adam Schreck, The Associated Press Israel delivered its long-expected response to Iranian missile attacks early Saturday by carrying out a series of airstrikes against the Islamic Republic. Here’s what to know: Multiple targets were struck Under the cover of darkness early Saturday, Israel struck multiple sites in different parts of Iran. Explosions were heard in the capital, Tehran, which sits deep inside the country. The Israeli military said its 'precise and targeted strikes' hit missile air defense systems and 'aerial capabilities' as well as missile manufacturing facilities used to produce weapons that have been used against Israel. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage.' It was not immediately clear how hard of a blow Israel dealt, with neither country providing detailed assessments of the destruction. Iran said the strikes targeted military bases in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran. Israel appeared confident in its battering of Iran’s air defenses, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying that 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' What wasn’t hit also matters The strikes did not appear to target facilities that would all but ensure a harsh Iranian response. Those most notably include Iran’s oil infrastructure, the backbone of the OPEC member’s economy, and its nuclear facilities. President Biden earlier this month said he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. officials felt they had secured agreement from Israel not to hit nuclear or oil sites after dispatching another air-defense missile battery and associated troops, though those assurances were not set in stone. This attack has finished Israel signaled that the pre-dawn bombardment was the end of this attack. 'The retaliatory strike has been completed, and its objectives have been achieved,' Hagari said early Saturday, still the Sabbath in Israel. Not long after, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization said commercial flights would resume after being halted because of the airstrikes. Tehran’s shops were open and streets were calm, though lines grew at gas stations as residents stocked up on fuel. The Israeli attacks aimed to deter future aggression and 'show we won’t be silent,' but to do so in a way that would minimize the embarrassment for Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. Outrage and calls for restraint The White House indicated that it wants the strikes to end the direct exchanges of fire between Israel and Iran, and warned Iran against responding. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there was a 'need to avoid further regional escalation' and called on all sides to show restraint. Reactions in the region were tougher. Saudi Arabia, Iran’s main Arab rival, condemned the strike, calling it a threat to regional security and 'a violation of international laws and norms.' Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' and said 'putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty.' Syria and Iraq were among other countries in the region condemning the strikes. So did Hamas, which along with other militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 hostages into Gaza. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up for more than half the deaths. Iran’s response will be key The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would respond to the airstrikes, calling them a clear violation of international law as it asserted Tehran’s right to self-defense. Israel characterized Saturday’s attack as a response to previous aerial assaults by Iran using missiles and exploding drones in April and another missile attack this month. Many of those projectiles were shot down before reaching their targets. Iran could attempt another direct bombardment, though doing so risks provoking yet another direct Israeli attack on its territory at a moment when its defenses are weakened. It could also encourage allied militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon to intensify their attacks, though both have suffered serious blows in their ongoing wars with Israel. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are in fact quite serious,' predicted Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in by their own military limitations, economic constraints from sanctions and by the U.S. election outcome,' which could affect the course of further escalation or diplomatic outreach.

Israel strikes military targets inside Iran	The targets included missile and drone manufacturing facilities and launch sites, as well as air-defense batteries. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Air Force fighter jets conducted precision strikes on military targets in Iran overnight Friday, nearly one month after Tehran launched a massive ballistic-missile attack on the Jewish state. According to the Israel Defense Forces, dozens of aircraft, including refuelers and spy planes, conducted 'waves' of attacks over the course of a few hours across several regions of Iran, located some 1,600 kilometers from Israel. The targets included missile and drone manufacturing facilities and launch sites, as well as air-defense batteries. The state-run SANA news outlet reported simultaneous Israeli strikes against military targets across central and southern Syria, amid Tehran’s decades-long effort to entrench itself in that country. The IDF named the operation 'Days of Repentance.' 'I can now confirm that we have concluded the Israeli response to Iran’s attacks against Israel. We conducted targeted and precise strikes on military targets in Iran—thwarting immediate threats to the State of Israel,' said IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. 'The Israel Defense Forces has fulfilled its mission. If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond. Our message is clear: All those who threaten the State of Israel and seek to drag the region into wider escalation will pay a heavy price,' Hagari continued. 'We demonstrated today that we have both the capability and the resolve to act decisively, and we are prepared—on offense and defense—to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel,' he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the overnight attack from the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, where he was later joined by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Mossad head David Barnea and Israel Security Agency leader Ronen Bar. 'The regime in Iran and its regional proxies have been relentlessly attacking Israel since [Hamas’s] Oct. 7th [massacre of 1,200 people]—on seven fronts—including direct attacks from Iranian soil,' the IDF said. 'Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and duty to respond.' The military was conducting an ongoing situation assessment, and there were no immediate changes to Home Front Command directives for civilians. Iran claimed to have successfully repelled the Israeli offensive, while ceding that 'limited damage' was caused to various sites. The Iranian military said that Israel had struck in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam. The Islamic Republic was prepared to retaliate to the 'aggression,' according to the country’s semi-official Tasnim news agency. 'There is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes,' the outlet quoted sources as saying. The Biden administration was informed of the strikes in advance, but the United States did not directly participate in the action. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett described the development as 'an exercise of self-defense and in response to Iran’s ballistic-missile attack against Israel on Oct. 1.' A senior administration official subsequently said that the attack 'should be the end of the direct military exchange between Israel and Iran. 'Should Iran choose to respond, we’re fully prepared to defend Israel and support Israel, and there will be consequences,' added the official. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin overnight Friday held a call with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, although no readout was provided. U.S. President Joe Biden previously urged Jerusalem to forgo attacking Iranian nuclear sites and oil fields, instead pressing for a small-scale operation. 'No administration has helped Israel more than I have—none, none, none. I think Bibi should remember that,' said the president, using Netanyahu’s nickname. By contrast, former president Donald Trump suggested that Iran’s nuclear infrastructure was fair game. 'I think he’s got that one wrong,' the Republican presidential candidate said of Biden. 'Isn’t that what you’re supposed to hit? I mean, it’s the biggest risk we have, nuclear weapons. … The answer should have been: Hit the nuclear first, and worry about the rest later.' Last week, Netanyahu emphasized that the Iranian targets chosen would be 'based on Israel’s national security needs.' Reports later suggested he had softened his stance in favor of a more limited strike due to Washington’s decision to deploy to Israel a THAAD advanced aerial defense system, and to avoid the perception of political interference in the upcoming U.S election. On Oct. 1, Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, forcing the entire civilian population of the Jewish state into bomb shelters. The targets of the Iranian attack were believed to be three Israeli Air Force bases, as well as an IDF military intelligence headquarters just north of Tel Aviv. In April, Iran conducted its first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory, launching some 300 missiles and drones, the vast majority of which were shot down in a multinational effort. The direct military confrontations come on the backdrop of Israel’s ongoing wars against Iranian terror proxies Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Construction begins in Saudi Arabia on Mukaab, expected to be the...	Mukaab will be 1,300 feet high and 1,200 feet wide, and it will be extensive enough to contain 20 Empire State buildings. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In Saudi Arabia, construction has begun on the $50 billion Mukaab project, which, upon its completion, is expected to be the world's largest building. It will also use artificial intelligence and green technology in its design. Located in Riyadh, Mukaab will be 1,300 feet high and 1,200 feet wide, and it will be extensive enough to contain 20 Empire State buildings. With 2 million square feet of floor space, the structure is expected to be a 'downtown in a box' and will house office space, apartments, hotels, restaurants, and retail space. The massive, high-tech cube will also contain 104,000 residential units and 9,000 hotel rooms. Mukaab will use artificial intelligence to create immersive experiences for guests and residents and will use ecology and traditional architecture to enhance the aesthetics. The building will recreate the experience of walking through wadis or riverbed formations, giving visitors the feeling that they are roaming past desert streams cascading off craggy rocks. The square design is a tribute to the Najdi architecture style, characterized by mudbrick buildings, triangular or rectangular windows and door openings, and centralized outdoor courtyards. Mukaab is estimated to add $51 billion to non-oil-related GDP and will generate over 330,000 jobs. The project will employ 900 workers and is expected to be completed by 2030 as part of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's Saudi Vision 2030, a project to reduce dependence on oil and expand the nation's economy, including the public service sector. Mohammad bin Salman has planned other projects as part of Saudi Vision 2030, including a floating port city called Oxagon, located on the Red Sea coast, a mountain tourist destination called Trojena, and a futuristic city called NEOM powered by renewable energy. In addition, plans are in place for 'The Line,' a 105-mile-long development that could house 9 million people while running entirely on renewable energy.

Progressives put pressure on Kamala Harris to change her message ...	Some liberals are frustrated by her approach, especially on her perceived support for Israel in the war against Hamas. By Steve Peoples, Associated Press Progressive Democrats warn Kamala Harris risks losing the support of a small but significant portion of her political base unless she changes her campaign’s closing message — and its messengers — immediately. Specifically, several progressive leaders believe that the Democratic nominee has been too focused on winning over moderate Republicans in recent days at the expense of her own party’s passionate liberals. And they say that Harris’ closing message, which is increasingly centered on Republican Donald Trump and the threat he poses to U.S. democracy, ignores the economic struggles of the nation’s working class. Some far-left leaders are also irked that Harris has shared the stage in recent days with former House Republican leader Liz Cheney and billionaire businessman Mark Cuban while progressive icons like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been relegated to low-profile roles. 'The truth of the matter is that there are a hell of a lot more working-class people who could vote for Kamala Harris than there are conservative Republicans,' Sanders told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday. Sanders noted that he’s been doing whatever he’s asked to help Harris win. He has participated in two dozen Harris campaign related-events this month alone, although they’re largely in rural areas. None have been with Harris. 'She has to start talking more to the needs of working-class people,' Sanders said. 'I wish this had taken place two months ago. It is what it is.' Less than two weeks before Election Day, Harris is trying to assemble a sprawling coalition featuring voting groups with conflicting priorities. She’s relying on the traditional Democratic base — African Americans, Latinos and young people who overwhelmingly lean left. Harris’ team is aware that some liberals are frustrated by her approach, especially on her support for Israel’s war against Hamas. But the campaign sees a major opportunity to expand her coalition by winning over disaffected Republicans, especially college-educated voters in the nation’s suburbs, who are uneasy about Trump. From the Harris campaign’s perspective, the focus on moderate Republicans at this moment is simply a matter of math. The Democrat’s campaign assesses that 10% of swing-state voters are still undecided or persuadable, according to an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Of that 10%, some 7% are considered 'Cheney Republicans' who are receptive to messages attacking Trump, the aide said. At the same time, the Harris campaign believes her chief political liability is the perception that she’s too far left. Trump’s allies are pounding the airwaves accusing the former California senator of being a 'radical-left liberal.' Therefore, she has been reluctant to appear with progressive icons like Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist. Harris instead made three swing-state appearances this week with Cheney, a stalwart conservative who was a Trump ally before turning sharply against him after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Harris is scheduled to deliver a major address next week, a formal closing argument of sorts, focused on the danger Trump poses to U.S. democracy. She will deliver the speech on Tuesday at the Ellipse in Washington, the same location where Trump hosted the rally that preceded the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Frustrated progressives do not discount the need to warn voters of Trump’s authoritarian leanings, but some wish her closing message was more focused on addressing voters’ overwhelming pessimism about the state of the economy and the direction of the country. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, praised Harris’ advertising team for 'smartly' investing hundreds of millions of dollars behind ads focusing on grocery prices, taxing billionaires and Social Security — 'things that both win swing voters and pump up the base.' But, Green said, 'there’s been an odd disconnect between the campaign’s economic populist ad strategy and the event strategy that focuses almost exclusively on Liz Cheney kumbaya optics that depress the base right as voting begins and don’t provably win more swing voters than bread-and-butter issues.' Other are frustrated that the Harris campaign hasn’t featured progressive leaders like Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez in higher-profile spots. Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of the progressive group Our Revolution, suggested that as many as 10% of progressives may not vote for Harris because of their frustrations. Some may not cast a ballot at all, he said, while some may even support Trump. The former president has called Cheney, a backer of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, a 'stupid war hawk' as he tries to win over Arab Americans in Michigan angry about the more than 42,000 Palestinians killed in Israel’s Gaza offensive. 'We just want to raise a red flag. Don’t take the progressive movement for granted,' Geevarghese said. 'There’s got to be an economic argument at the end of the day. That’s the No. 1 thing that matters to voters.' Indeed, about 4 in 10 likely voters in a recent CNN poll said the economy was their most important issue when deciding how to vote, and about 2 in 10 said protecting democracy was. About 1 in 10 named either immigration or abortion and reproductive rights. To be sure, Harris is not ignoring the economy or other progressive priorities. She has outlined plans to crack down on price gouging by corporations to help reduce the cost of groceries in addition to reducing the cost of prescription drugs, cutting taxes on the middle class while raising taxes on billionaires, offering a $25,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers to help lower housing costs, and expanding Medicare to cover vision and hearing coverage, among other things. Ocasio-Cortez made three stops in swing-state Pennsylvania last week on Harris’ behalf. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, a key Harris ally, has also been a steady presence on the campaign trail. Former President Barack Obama, still beloved by many progressive voters, has been active in the campaign’s closing days. He headlined an event with Harris for the first time on Thursday night in Georgia. Meanwhile, Trump is continuing to lean in on the issues that his campaign sees as his strongest: the economy and inflation, immigration, crime and foreign policy. The Republican nominee is set to outline his formal closing message Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York City that’s expected to focus on average Americans’ displeasure with the direction of the country. He begins virtually every rally with a variation of: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? 'Kamala Harris broke the economy. She broke the border. President Trump very clearly is going to fix the economy and fix the border,' said Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller, who argued Harris, with her focus on Trump, wasn’t talking about how she will make life better for the vast majority of Americans. Harris acknowledged during a CNN town hall this week that some progressives may be unhappy with her leadership, particularly on Israel. 'But I also do know that for many people who care about this issue, they also care about bringing down the price of groceries,' she said. 'They also care about our democracy and not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.'

Israel demands ‘urgent investigation’ after Hamas commander found...	The IDF said it killed in an airstrike Mohammad Abu Itiwi, a senior commander from Hamas’s elite Nukhba unit, who was employed by UNWRA. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel demanded an 'urgent investigation' of UNRWA as the agency confirmed on Thursday that a Hamas commander who participated in the October 7 attacks was on its payroll. The Israel Defense Forces said it killed in an airstrike Mohammad Abu Itiwi, a senior commander from Hamas’s elite Nukhba unit, who was employed by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which supports Palestinian refugees. 'Following this, our representatives solicited clarifications from senior officials in the @UN and international community and requested an urgent investigation into the involvement of @UNRWA employees in the October 7th Massacre' tweeted the Defense Ministry’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories unit (COGAT) on Thursday night. UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma confirmed that Itiwi’s name was included in an Israeli letter in July which identified other Hamas figures on the agency staff. 'The UNRWA commissioner general responded to that letter immediately stating that any allegation is taken seriously. He urged [Israeli officials] to cooperate with the agency by providing more information so he could take action,' Touma said. UNRWA has been under fire for months, with Israeli officials demanding the agency be stripped of its authority in Gaza and defunded amid revelations that members of the agency’s staff participated in Hamas’s October 7 attacks. The Israeli government is bypassing UNRWA in distributing humanitarian aid and advancing legislation to label the agency as a terror organization and remove its diplomatic immunity, tax-exempt status and other legal benefits. Palestinian refugees are the only refugee population with its own dedicated. UN agency. The rest of the world’s refugees fall under the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Israeli officials have called for UNRWA to be closed and for Palestinian refugees to be brought under the responsibility of the UNHCR. In June, more than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA, accusing the agency of 'aiding and abetting' the terror group. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Nukhba terrorist who led Oct 7th Nova bomb shelter attack elimina...	Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was executed by his Hamas captors in September, lost an arm in the attack and was taken hostage along with Alon Ohel, Or Levy, and Eliya Cohen. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Thursday, in a joint effort by the IDF, Israel's security agency (Shin Bet), and the IAF, the commander in charge of the October 7 attack on the bomb shelter close to the Nova music festival was eliminated. The IDF reported that Mohammad Abu Itiwi was a Nukhba commander in the Al Bureij Battalion of Hamas's Central Camps Brigade. Itiwi led the attack on the bomb shelter on Route 232 in the area of Re'im in southern Israel. While Nova festival attendees were hiding on October 7, terrorists attacked the shelter with grenades, killing many of those inside and injuring others. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was executed by his Hamas captors in September, lost an arm in the attack and was taken hostage along with Alon Ohel, Or Levy, and Eliya Cohen. Itiwi led many other terror attacks against Israelis, and his name appears on a list of employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA). Throughout the war, it has come to light that UNRWA, an organization with the stated aim of providing aid to Palestinians, has been heavily embedded with terrorists. When Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed two weeks ago, one of his bodyguards, also eliminated in the attack, held a UNRWA membership card. Fateh Sherif, who commanded Hamas in Lebanon and was killed in an Israeli strike in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre last month, was also an employee of UNWRA. Sherif was the principal of UNRWA's Deir Yassin School in Tyre and headed the UNRWA teacher's union in Lebanon. The Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee unanimously approved two legislative proposals early in October aimed at curbing the activities of UNWRA within Israel. 'UNRWA is out!' Committee Chairman MK Yuli Edelstein declared after the vote. 'The problem of UNRWA did not begin on October 7; it has long been a concern that has surfaced in all its malignancy. For many years, lawmakers across the political spectrum have raised the issue and advanced legislative proposals.'

French president Macron accuses Israel of ‘sowing barbarism,’ com...	Macron said Israel 'knows from experience that its military successes do not necessarily represent victory in Lebanon.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News At an international conference on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron urged countries to give 'massive' aid to Lebanon and accused Israel of 'sowing barbarism' with its operations against Hezbollah. While pledging a $108 million (100 million euro) aid package, Macron declared, 'In the immediate term, massive aid is needed for the Lebanese population, both for the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the war and for the communities hosting them.' The United Nations has recommended $426 million in humanitarian aid for Lebanon. In addition to France's $106 million, Italy has pledged $10.8 million, and Germany has vowed to give $64.7 million. At the same time, Macron strongly criticized Israel for its military operations in South Lebanon, which has been blamed for the displacement of 800,000 people. Urging a ceasefire, Macron said, 'in the south, in Beirut, elsewhere, and that the number of civilian victims continues to rise.' Although he briefly criticized Hezbollah for its attacks against Israel, which began on October 8th, he focused his criticism on Israeli strikes against the terror group. He said Hezbollah should 'stop its provocations… and indiscriminate strikes' against Israel. However, he added that Israel 'knows from experience that its military successes do not necessarily represent victory in Lebanon.' 'I'm not sure you can defend a civilization by sowing barbarism yourself,' he added. In Lebanon, Hezbollah functions like a state within a state, and the country is controlled by dueling factions with no functioning president. Israel's Northern Command reports that Hezbollah only has 30% of its rockets and launchers remaining and has lost 2,000 of its terrorists since October 8th last year. The Northern Command added that just a few more weeks of operations in Lebanon are required to accomplish goals that will allow northern Israeli residents to return home in safety. According to IDF data, 2,000 Hezbollah terrorists have been eliminated since the war began, 1,200 of them since the initial ground operation in Lebanon. Of the terrorists the IDF eliminated, seven were Hezbollah brigade commanders, 21 were battalion commanders, and 24 were company commanders. The IDF attacked 3,200 Hezbollah targets, which include weapons depots, launchers, anti-tank positions, and command centers, 300 of them in the last 24 hours.

Biden-Harris admin promotes Pentagon employee tied to Iranian inf...	Ariane Tabatabai, outed as a member of the Iran Experts Initiative, will now lead DoD's 'force and education training' By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon The Biden-Harris administration has promoted the senior Pentagon employee who was outed as a member of an Iranian government-run influence operation, Politico reported. Ariane Tabatabai is now a deputy assistant secretary of defense within Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's office, where she will lead its force education and training division. Tabatabai, according to Politico, was offered the promotion last month. She previously served as chief of staff for the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict. Tabatabai became a public commodity after a 2023 Semafor report outed her as a member of an Iranian government propaganda group known as the Iran Experts Initiative. The affiliation saw Tabatabai report back to Iran’s foreign ministry and communicate with senior officials in the hardline regime. Tabatabai's promotion comes at a curious time for the Biden-Harris administration. Over the weekend, classified U.S. intelligence on Israel's military preparations for a strike on Iran leaked in a 'deadly serious breach,' which the administration is investigating. While the leaker has not been publicly identified, the situation has raised concerns about a host of Biden-Harris administration officials, including Tabatabai, who want to increase diplomacy with Iran at the cost of the historically close U.S. alliance with Israel. News of Tabatabai's affiliation with the Iran Experts Initiative sparked multiple congressional investigations, with Republicans raising concerns about Tabatabai’s ability to obtain a top-secret security clearance. The Pentagon and State Department, where Tabatabai formerly worked, have vocally defended her, saying there was nothing in her background that would have disqualified her from accessing classified information. 'Dr. Tabatabai was thoroughly and properly vetted as a condition of her employment with the Department of Defense,' a Pentagon spokesman told the Washington Free Beacon in September 2023, after lawmakers raised concerns about her connections to Iran. 'We are honored to have her serve.' One month later, the Pentagon confirmed to lawmakers that Tabatabai would keep her security clearance. Tabatabai and two others affiliated with the pro-Tehran group served as aides to former Biden-Harris administration Iran envoy Robert Malley, who was suspended from his post amid an ongoing FBI investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified information. An inspector general report released last month skewered the State Department for its handling of the suspension. The agency, according to the report, allowed Malley to continue accessing classified information and sensitive data after he was disciplined. 'The Department deviated from the way that suspensions are typically delivered by delaying notification to Mr. Malley until senior Department officials were apprised of his suspension,' the report stated. 'The delay allowed him the opportunity to participate in a classified conference call after the suspension was approved, but before he was notified.'

Ten IDF soldiers killed in south Lebanon in two days	Five Israeli soldiers killed in a Hezbollah rocket attack in southern Lebanon, a day after five others were killed in a pair of incidents. By World Israel News Staff Five IDF soldiers were killed during a Hezbollah rocket attack in southern Lebanon on Thursday, the IDF announced Friday, after the soldiers' identities were cleared for publication by the army censor. The soldiers, all reservists, were from the 89th Battalion of the IDF's 8th Armored Brigade.

In addition to the 5 fatalities in the Hezbollah attack, 19 other IDF reservist soldiers were injured, including 5 who were seriously injured. According to a preliminary investigation by the Israeli military, a Hezbollah rocket struck a building in southern Lebanon where the 89th Battalion was receiving an incoming supply convoy. One of the fallen soldiers, Guy Idan, has been identified as the cousin of Tsahi Idan, a hostage taken captive by Hamas terrorists on October 7th after they invaded his home town of Kibbutz Nahal Oz. Five more soldiers were killed and seven wounded in a pair of incidents in southern Lebanon Wednesday night and Thursday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 10 from Wednesday night through Thursday.

Israel has repeatedly pointed out that the deliveries of humanitarian aid are being looted by the armed jihadists of Hamas, who often attack Palestinian civilians for trying to access them. By i24 and Algemeiner Staff Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday announced another $135 million in aid to Gaza, saying it was critical that aid enter the war-ravaged enclave. Blinken spoke in Qatar on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the war in Gaza last year, sparked by the October 7 massacre. Washington has pressed Israel to allow more aid into the devastated Palestinian territory, while Israel has repeatedly pointed out that the deliveries are being looted by the armed jihadists of Hamas, who often attack Palestinian civilians for trying to access them. In Qatar, Blinken 'discussed renewed efforts to secure the release of the hostages and end the war in Gaza' with the Gulf state’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, the State Department said. Having wrapped up a two-day trip to Israel, Blinken now seeks to build momentum for a ceasefire after Israel’s killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar; he flew to Qatar to seek assessments of where Hamas stands on a truce.

Hamas chief ordered terrorists to keep Israeli hostages alive to ...	Newly-released handwritten documents penned by the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar include detailed documentation of the hostages taken captive on October 7th, along with instructions on how to guard them and keep them alive for a deal to release jailed terrorists. By World Israel News Staff The late Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar ordered terrorists guarding Israeli captives taken during the invasion of October 7th to ensure the hostages' survival, so that they could be used to secure the release of jailed Palestinian terrorists, according to documents written by Sinwar which were published by a Palestinian newspaper this week. The Arabic daily Al-Quds published scans of three pages which allegedly including Sinwar's instructions to underlings regarding the handling of Israeli hostages. The documents also include meticulous details regarding their distribution, demographic breakdown, occupations, and names, with some names matching those released during a prior deal in November. The first document contains directives on protecting the lives of hostages, emphasizing their strategic value for future prisoner exchanges with Israel. Sinwar cited verses from the Quran, underscoring the importance of using the hostages as leverage. 'They are an important card,' Sinwar wrote, according to the report. A second paper offers a statistical overview of the hostages, categorizing them by gender, age, and civilian or military status. The documents allegedly specify where Bedouin captives are held, although the specific geographic details were censored. This list reportedly tallied a total of 72 hostages at the time of recording, many of whom were subsequently released. In a third paper, 11 released hostages are listed with identifying information such as age and foreign citizenship status. The named hostages include Rimon Kirsht, Tami Metzger, and Nili Margalit, the latter noted as a nurse.

Iran planning unprecedented attack if Israel retaliates for balli...	Iran reportedly looking to avoid major reprisal from Israel over ballistic missile attacks - while at the same time preparing major attacks on Israel and international energy supplies, in the event of an Israeli attack. By World Israel News Staff The Iranian military is preparing for an unprecedented attack on both Israel and international trade and energy supplies, even as Tehran hopes to avoid a major escalation with the Jewish state, The New York Times reported on Thursday. Citing four Iranian officials - including two officers in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - who spoke with the paper by telephone earlier this week, the Times report claimed that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has instructed the Iranian military to draft plans for various possible attacks on not only Israeli targets, but also ships carrying goods - in particular, oil - through the Persian Gulf. Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on October 1st, prompting Israel to vow a major retaliation. While Tehran has reportedly signaled via interlocutors that it will not respond to a symbolic Israeli retaliation, according to the Times report, Iran is at the same time gearing up to strike should an Israeli attack cross one of Tehran's red lines. According to the report, Iran's leadership will order a major reprisal should Israel strike Iran's nuclear program, cause major damage to the country's oil or natural gas production, or assassinates senior Iranian leaders. Some of the possible Iranian reprisal attacks under consideration are an upscaled ballistic missile attack, dwarfing the April 13th and October 1st attacks, which including some 120 and 180 ballistic missile launches respectively. The Iranian officials cited said that Tehran could launch a barrage of up to 1,000 ballistic missiles in the next strike. In addition, proxy groups working on behalf of Iran, including Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and various militia groups operating out of Iraq and Syria, could also attack Israel. Furthermore, Iran is considering attacks on international trade, in particular oil tankers traveling through the Persian Gulf. 'In the event of an Israeli attack, the shape of our response will be proportionate and calculated,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, told Russian reporters on Wednesday.

Freed Israeli hostage tells UN of horrifying sexual assault durin...	Soussana told the UN, 'Fulfill your duty. Take immediate action to secure the release of those still held captive.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Wednesday, Amit Soussana, a lawyer who was kidnapped from Kfar Azza by Hamas on October 7th and released after 55 days, described her horrifying ordeal as a hostage in Gaza, which included sexual assault. 'I was held captive alone, chained by my ankle with a metal chain, unable to move, and had to ask for permission to use the bathroom,' she said. 'In that house, I was sexually assaulted by the Hamas terrorist who guarded me. He forced me to go to the shower and entered the room, pointing his gun at me. He was breathing heavily and had a monstrous, beast-like face,' Soussana continued. 'I knew exactly what he was planning to do, yet I couldn't do anything to prevent it. I was utterly helpless. When the assault was over, I wasn't even allowed to cry or to be sad. I had no one to comfort me and was forced to act nice to the person who had just sexually assaulted me in the most horrifying way,' she added. 'Not a day goes by that I don't think about what that terrible man did to me. We were held in such inhumane conditions. No person should ever be subjected to such ruthless treatment,' she said. Soussana appealed to the UN to take action to secure the release of the hostages. 'Fulfill your duty. Take immediate action to secure the release of those still held captive. Every day that passes steals another piece of their soul and endangers their life. Act now before it is too late…do not turn a blind eye to the atrocities being committed against innocent civilians.' Soussana attended a screening of a documentary produced by former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg called 'Screams Before Silence,' detailing the sexual crimes committed by Hamas on and after October 7th.

5 IDF soldiers killed in Southern Lebanon	Since the beginning of the ground war in Lebanon, 22 IDF soldiers have been killed in battle. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Four IDF soldiers were killed Wednesday night, and one fell on Thursday morning battling Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. The names of the fallen soldiers are as follows: Warrant Officer (res.) Mordechai Haim Amoyal, Sgt. Maj. (res.) Shmuel Harari, Master Sgt. (res.) Shlomo Aviad Nayman, and Sgt. First Class (res.) Shuvael Ben-Natan and Sgt. First class Guy Ben-Harosh (23). A total of 7 IDF soldiers were wounded in Lebanon between Wednesday and Thursday. Amoyal, Harari, Nayman, and Ben-Natan were preparing to battle Radwan force terrorists who had hidden in an area with dense forestation and tunnels where they could hide. Although airstrikes were intended to clear the area and make it safe for IDF troops, the terrorists managed to hide underground and throw grenades at the soldiers as they approached. After the terrorists attacked, IDF troops threw grenades and neutralized them. During this incident, in addition to the four soldiers who were killed, six were injured, three in serious condition. Major General Guy Ben-Harosh was killed in another area of southern Lebanon, and a reserve soldier was seriously injured in the incident. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said, 'There is fighting, and we have the upper hand in these battles. We also have casualties, and we pay a heavy price.' He added, 'There are quite a few Radwan terrorists who have surrendered, and more than 1,500 Hezbollah operatives that we have eliminated so far. We go through all the villages in a systematic and thorough manner so that we can tell the residents of the north that we have cleaned this area.' 'We will continue to do this in parallel with our actions of eliminating the commanders in Beirut,' Hagari said. Since the beginning of the ground war in Lebanon, 22 IDF soldiers have been killed in battle.

Israel reveals 6 Al Jazeera journalists as members of Hamas and I...	The IDF disclosed that documents found in Gaza confirmed that the journalists were members of the terror organizations. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Wednesday alleged that six Al Jazeera journalists are members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, two Islamist terrorist organizations, citing documents it uncovered in Gaza. The IDF said on X/Twitter that it had obtained documents and intelligence information revealing that the six journalists — Anas Jamal Mahmoud Al-Sharif, Alaa Abdul Aziz Muhammad Salama, Hossam Basel Abdul Karim Shabat, Ashraf Sami Ashour Saraj, Ismail Farid Muhammad Abu Omar, and Talal Mahmoud Abdul Rahman Aruki — are members of the Palestinian terrorist groups, arguing the revelations call into question the credibility and impartiality of Al Jazeera’s reporting in Gaza. 'The IDF has disclosed intelligence information and numerous documents found in Gaza confirming military affiliation of six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad terrorist organizations, including personnel tables, lists of terrorist training courses, phone directories, and salary documents for terrorists,' the IDF wrote on X/Twitter. 'These documents serve as proof of the integration of Hamas terrorists within the Qatari Al Jazeera media network,' the Israeli military added. 'Most of the journalists that the IDF has exposed as operatives in Hamas’ military wing spearhead the propaganda for Hamas at Al Jazeera, especially in northern Gaza.' Abu Omar suffered injuries during an IDF strike in February and underwent surgery for a leg amputation. Al Jazeera English defended him by writing on social media that 'Israeli aggression will not quash journalistic endeavors in the Gaza Strip.' The IDF subsequently accused Abu Omar of serving as a deputy commander within Hamas’s Eastern Battalion of Khan Yunis and even participating in the terrorist group’s Oct. 7 massacre in Israel last year. Eyewitnesses have accused the Al Jazeera reporter of helping facilitate the Hamas incursion into Israel. In August, the IDF accused Al Jazeera reporter Ismail al-Ghoul of doubling as a senior Hamas operative and alleged that he participated in the Oct. 7 onslaught. Al Jazeera slammed the IDF’s claims about its journalists as 'baseless' and argued that the Israeli military has exhibited a 'pattern of hostility.' 'The Network views these fabricated accusations as a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region, thereby obscuring the harsh realities of the war from audiences worldwide,' added in a statement. Approximately one-third of journalists killed during the war in Gaza were employed by Hamas-affiliated media such as Al-Aqsa Voice Radio, Al-Quds Al-Youm, Al-Aqsa Television, and Quds News, according to reporting by Jewish Insider. Al-Aqsa Television was designated by the US Department of Treasury for being controlled and financed by Hamas. Last month, the IDF conducted a raid on the Al Jazeera offices in the city of Ramallah in the West Bank. The IDF accused Al Jazeera of using the offices 'to incite terror' and ordered them closed for 45 days. Al Jazeera decried the allegations as 'unfounded' and lambasted the IDF for allegedly suppressing freedom of press.
