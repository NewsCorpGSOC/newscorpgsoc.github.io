Exit polls show Harris made big mistake passing over Pennsylvania...	Shapiro, a practicing Jew and a popular governor known for his charismatic speaking style, had established himself as a fierce defender of Israel and Jewish interests. By Jewish Breaking News Kamala Harris’s decision to pass over Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro for her vice presidential slot proved to be a critical miscalculation, with exit polling data revealing the choice significantly dampened her support among Jewish voters. According to a survey conducted by the Honan Strategy Group for the Teach Coalition, Harris could have secured a commanding 53% to 38% margin among Pennsylvania’s Jewish voters had she selected Shapiro instead of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Instead, the Harris-Walz ticket managed only a modest 48% to 41% advantage of the Jewish vote. Shapiro, a practicing Jew and popular governor known for his charismatic speaking style, had established himself as a fierce defender of Israel and Jewish interests. He notably condemned anti-Israel campus protesters, comparing such demonstrations to 'people dressed up in KKK outfits or KKK regalia' in a CNN interview. Following Hamas’s October 7 attack, Shapiro took decisive action, delivering speeches at local synagogues, issuing strong condemnations of the terrorist group, and ordering flags to fly at half-mast at the state capitol. Then-Republican nominee Donald Trump seized on the controversy, suggesting Harris blocked Shapiro from the ticket because of his Jewish faith, arguing she feared losing Muslim voters in swing states like Michigan amid heightened focus on the Gaza war. While Shapiro himself defended Harris against accusations of antisemitism, the campaign never fully recovered from perceptions that she was soft on antisemitism and an unreliable ally of Israel. Though some political observers attributed Harris’s decision to concerns about Shapiro’s ambition and the possibility of being overshadowed by her running mate, numbers don’t lie and perhaps Pennsylvania would have swung her way had she stuck with the right choice rather than conceding to Hamas sympathizers.

Argentina seizes trove of Nazi memorabilia as part of internation...	They seized over 60 firearms from a home, including 43 rifles with Nazi eagle markings, pistols, bayonets and machine guns, and arrested a man. By Juan Melamed, JTA Police in Argentina have seized a trove of Nazi weapons and memorabilia, including dozens of guns, uniforms and busts of Hitler, in their latest discovery of Nazi relics in a country that gave refuge to Nazi leaders. The federal police’s anti-mafia division uncovered the items during a raid Friday in Quilmes, a city near Buenos Aires. They seized over 60 firearms from a home, including 43 rifles with Nazi eagle markings, pistols, bayonets and machine guns, and arrested a man. The name of the detained was not disclosed and an investigation is ongoing. According to the Ministry of Security, the investigation was made together with the police of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as part of an investigation into international weapons trafficking. Argentina’s national security minister, Patricia Bullrich, said the country had seized 'weapons and parts from a dark and tragic era of humanity.' Argentina has had an anti-discrimination law on the books since 1988 that criminalizes trafficking in such objects. Professionals from the Holocaust Museum of Buenos Aires participated in the raid and confirmed that the objects violated the law, according to local reports. Argentina was a refuge for Nazis after World War II. Adolf Eichmann was captured in the northern area of Buenos Aires in 1960. Nazi war criminals Joseph Mengele and Erich Priebke also made their way to Argentina. In October 2018 Argentina’s Jewish political umbrella organization revealed excerpts from tens of thousands of documents about World War II that shed light on the Nazi influence on the country and the Nazi war criminals who hid here. Meanwhile, Nazi relics — and items forged by their admirers — have continued to circulate. In June 2016, a collector from Argentina paid $680,000 for Nazi underpants and other memorabilia. T he following year, investigators announced the seizure of 75 items, including those seemingly used in medical experiments; most were later revealed to be forgeries. Last year, police raided and closed a publisher that was distributing Nazi literature.

Hezbollah rocket hits Israeli Arab city, killing woman	Earlier on Monday, a 65-year-old woman was lightly wounded by shrapnel from a Hezbollah rocket attack on Israel’s Galilee, and a 34-year-old man was lightly injured in another barrage less than two hours later. By JNS One Israeli was killed on Monday and five others were wounded when a Hezbollah terrorist rocket fired from Lebanon scored a direct hit on a building in the northern Arab city of Shfar’am, medical officials said. The Magen David Adom medical emergency response group initially reported that one woman was seriously wounded after being trapped, while five others sustained light wounds in the attack on the structure. The Israel Fire and Rescue Authority said multiple rescue teams were deployed to the three-story building to search for additional victims. According to the Israel Defense Forces, five projectiles were launched as part of the barrage. 'Interception attempts were made. Impacts have been detected,' the military announced in a post on social media. 6 פצועים בשתי זירות נפילה בשפרעם, בהם פצועה באורח אנוש@CBeyar pic.twitter.com/myiO0rMB0X &mdash; כאן חדשות (@kann_news) November 18, 2024 Earlier on Monday, a 65-year-old woman was lightly wounded by shrapnel from a Hezbollah rocket attack on Israel’s Galilee. A 34-year-old man was lightly injured in another barrage less than two hours later. According to Magen David Adom, the woman was treated on the scene before being evacuated to Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya along with another person suffering from anxiety. The injured man was also transported to the same hospital, according to MDA, which said he suffered from 'blast injuries.' Hezbollah launched 30 rockets at the Upper and Western Galilee areas in the attack that injured the woman, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Some of the projectiles were intercepted, while the rest fell in open areas, the military said. בהמשך להתרעות שהופעלו לפני זמן קצר במרחבים הגליל העליון והגליל המערבי, זוהו כ-30 שיגורים שחצו משטח לבנון, חלקם יורטו והיתר נפלו בשטחים פתוחים &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 18, 2024 Sirens continued to sound in northern Israel in the late morning and early afternoon hours, including in Arab al-Aramshe, Misgav Am, Margaliot and Kiryat Shmona. Seventy-six people in northern Israel have been killed by Hezbollah cross-border rocket, missile and drone attacks since the start of the war, including 31 soldiers and six foreign citizens, according to the latest data provided by the Prime Minister’s Office, updated on Sunday. In addition, 729 people have been wounded, including 497 civilians and 232 soldiers. Of these, 29 civilians and 37 soldiers were severely injured; 63 civilians and 38 soldiers were moderately injured and 405 civilians and 157 soldiers were mildly injured. Dozens of Hezbollah launchers, rockets, weapons destroyed IDF forces operating in Southern Lebanon have located and destroyed dozens of multi-barrel launches, mortars, rocket caches and military equipment used in Hezbollah’s attacks against Israel over the past year, the military said on Monday. The IDF highlighted the work of troops from the 226th Reserve Brigade, operating under the command of the 146th Division, in finding these launchers both above and below ground. Troops also discovered and dismantled what the IDF said was an extensive underground terrorist facility, including weapons stockpiles, living quarters and a fully equipped and stocked kitchen. Also found at the site were 'combat equipment and operational maps, detailing Israeli settlements, ranges and plans, all ready for action,' according to the military. 'The troops are continuing to locate and dismantle terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon that Hezbollah used to plan and execute attacks against Israel.' Lebanese official: 90-95% of Dahieh residents evacuated A municipal leader from the Beirut area said on Monday that 90-95% of residents in the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahieh south of the capital have evacuated due to warnings from Israel’s military, Ynet reported. The Lebanese official added that significant destruction to the district has been reported, surpassing the damage seen during the month-long Second Lebanon War in 2006. Israel has been waging a devastating aerial campaign against Hezbollah throughout Lebanon, including its stronghold of Dahieh south of Beirut. According to Israeli estimates, the terror group has lost most of its arsenal to the ongoing strikes. Then-defense minister Yoav Gallant said in late October that Hezbollah is estimated to have lost over 80% of its long-range rockets since the start of the war. The IDF said on Nov. 12 that most of Hezbollah’s weapons storage sites and missile production facilities in Dahieh have been destroyed during the war, erasing two decades of buildup.

In historic first, female combat soldiers deployed in Lebanon	Their roles included intelligence gathering, identifying terrorist threats, and directing fire for ground and air forces. By Vered Weiss The IDF deployed female combat soldiers into Lebanon for the first time, The Jerusalem Post reports. Northern Command chief Maj.-Gen. Ori Gordin approved the deployment several weeks ago. The women served as members of a combat intelligence team stationed near the Syrian border in the Mount Dov region. Their roles included intelligence gathering, identifying terrorist threats, and directing fire for ground and air forces. The Jerusalem Post interviewed several female soldiers, including Corporal Tehila, 21, from the Eit Battalion. 'Southern Lebanon? We went in on foot. How much weight did we carry? Too much,' she said with a laugh. 'Around 40% of our body weight. We were preparing for a long ambush.' Corporal Shani, 20, described the mission in detail, 'We walked about 1.5 kilometers into Lebanon, established a position in the field, maintained camouflage, and began intelligence collection using observation tools. Operationally, we entered areas untouched by Israeli forces since the Second Lebanon War.' The soldiers provided valuable intelligence, including locating key terrorists hiding in buildings and details about anti-tank missile sites. The soldiers described how they guided an operation based on photographs that provided precise information about crucial locations and targets. In addition, their images allowed other soldiers to find weapons that were embedded within civilian areas. The team was behind enemy lines for 24 hours close to a location known to have a high concentration of Hezbollah terrorists. A fire broke out in the area and forced their evacuation. The soldiers focused mainly on concealing their positions and gathering intelligence, which provided a significant challenge. During the Israeli airstrike on Iran, four female pilots played a pivotal role in assisting the IAF in hitting crucial targets. The operation involved F-15 and F-16 fighter jets departing from Israel, and four female navigators from the Israeli Air Force (IAF) played a pivotal role in the historic mission.

Diamond Fraud Under the Microscope: Israeli Tech Promises Market ...	Rabinovich leveraged advanced spectroscopy and imaging techniques to identify subtle differences in diamond structure. By Pesach Benson, TPS A groundbreaking patent by a professor at Israel’s Ariel University promises to revolutionize the diamond industry by offering a reliable and cost-effective method for distinguishing between natural and synthetic diamonds. This innovation comes at a crucial time, as the market is increasingly flooded with synthetic diamonds whose lower prices pose significant challenges to the traditional gemstone sector. The commercial importance of this development lies in its ability to address a pressing industry need. Synthetic diamonds, produced in laboratories through advanced techniques like High Pressure, High Temperature (HPHT) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), have seen a dramatic rise in popularity, costing 20-40% less than natural diamonds. However, this affordability has disrupted the market, increasing demand for a dependable system to verify the origin of diamonds. The patented technology was developed by Dr. Yossi Rabinovitch as part of his doctoral thesis at Ariel University. Rabinovich leveraged advanced spectroscopy and imaging techniques to identify subtle differences in diamond structure. By analyzing fluorescence patterns under UV light or atomic-level variations through laser-based methods, Rabinovitch’s system can quickly and accurately determine a diamond’s origin. Unlike existing methods, this innovation offers a more affordable solution, making it accessible to a broader range of jewelers and gemologists. Visually, natural and synthethic diamonds are identical to the naked eye. Natural diamonds are formed deep within the Earth’s mantle over billions of years under extreme pressure and heat. This slow process creates unique inclusions and imperfections that serve as geological fingerprints. In contrast, synthetic diamonds are grown in controlled lab environments within weeks. While they share the same chemical composition and crystalline structure as natural diamonds, they often exhibit distinctive growth patterns and fewer imperfections. According to the 'Synthetic Diamonds – Global Strategic Business Report' released in October, the global market for synthetic diamonds is projected to reach $21.4 billion in 2030, compared to $15.3 billion in 2023. They are increasingly being used in electronics, optical, and cutting tool industries. Researchers are also exploring the use of nanodiamonds in the fields of medicine, aerospace, automobiles and electronics. However, criminals have also taken advantage of synthetic diamonds. In December 2023, police in Hong Kong arrested four people who exported synthetic diamonds to India with fictitious paperwork declaring them to be natural diamonds. The synthetic diamonds were the centerpiece of a $64 million money laundering scheme.

Israel will not allow Hamas to govern Gaza again, Netanyahu vows	Netanyahu reportedly said he ordered officials to prepare a plan aimed at replacing Hamas in the distribution of humanitarian aid by Nov. 21. By JNS Hamas continues to frustrate ongoing hostages-for-ceasefire negotiations in the hopes of ending the war and returning to power in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday. 'The only thing that Hamas wants is a deal that ends the war and for the IDF to leave the Strip in order to return to power,' the premier said, according to Walla. 'I am not ready to allow that under any circumstance.' Netanyahu told lawmakers that the Palestinian terrorist group 'sees the pressure' put on his government in both the domestic and international spheres, and believes it can thwart the talks to secure better conditions. The prime minister said during the closed-door meeting that he believes some 50 out of the 101 remaining hostages held by Hamas remain alive. He told committee members that while there is currently no concrete proposal on the table, various 'ideas have come up' in recent days. The Qatari-owned Al-Araby Al-Jadeed outlet cited a Hamas source as saying earlier this week that the Islamist organization’s leadership has cut all contact with those actually holding the hostages, due to 'strict security measures to protect the important negotiation card.' The source added that Hamas has refused to provide information on the whereabouts and status of the hostages, in particular those with U.S. citizenship, as it has not been offered 'compensation' by mediators. According to Channel 12, Netanyahu noted on Monday that while the Israel Defense Forces operation in Gaza has destroyed most of Hamas’s 'military' infrastructure, its ruling capabilities remain largely intact. Netanyahu reportedly said he ordered officials to prepare a plan aimed at replacing Hamas in the distribution of humanitarian aid by Nov. 21. Also on Monday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who leads the Religious Zionism Party, told reporters that the IDF should occupy the entire northern part of the Strip until the hostages are released. Jerusalem needs to 'inform Hamas in clear terms that if the hostages do not return, we exercise our sovereignty and stay there forever,' he said, adding, 'Then, Hamas will have the motivation to keep them alive.' Roughly 1,200 Israeli Jews were murdered by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, thousands more were wounded and 251 others were taken into the Gaza Strip. On-and-off indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have dragged on for months, with the U.S., Egypt and Qatar acting as intermediaries. The return of the hostages still held by Hamas terrorists after 409 days remains the 'most important value goal' in the ongoing war, Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated in a statement on Sunday.

Report: Lebanon accepts US ceasefire deal disarming Hezbollah	Hezbollah reportedly sending its response to an American ceasefire proposal which would require the terror group be demilitarized and Israel given the right to retaliate in Lebanon for any ceasefire violations. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The government of Lebanon has accepted the United States proposal for a ceasefire between Israel and the Hezbollah terrorist group, according to a report Sunday, while Hezbollah has sent its official response to the peace plan. Late Sunday night, Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International (LBCI) reported that Beirut has accepted, with some caveats, the framework for a truce submitted by the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon, and that the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group Hezbollah has already penned a response, which is being forwarded to the United States. The report stated that while Lebanon has accepted the general outline of the ceasefire proposal, Beirut has asked for clarifications regarding some provisions and is pushing for alterations to others. In particular, Lebanon is seeking greater steps to limit Israel's ability to operate in Lebanese territory should the ceasefire be violated. According to the Saudi-based Asharq al-Awsat daily, Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri - a member of the Amal Shi'ite nationalist movement - is serving as interlocuter between Biden administration envoy Amos Hochstein and Hezbollah. Hochstein is set to visit Beirut on Tuesday in a bid to push forward with a ceasefire deal. According to a report Monday morning by Lebanon's Nidaa al-Watan outlet, the American ceasefire proposal centers around three main points. First, the Hezbollah terror group would be required to demilitarize - not only south of the Litani River, near the Israeli frontier, but also north of it. This provision, the report said, is considered non-negotiable by the U.S., due in part to Israeli insistence on the disarming of the Iran-backed proxy group. In addition, the draft submitted to Lebanon calls for the establishment of a supervisory committee to oversee the implementation of the ceasefire, to ensure adherence to the deal and monitory violations, and to ensure the fulfillment of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. The August 11th, 2006 resolution calls for the disarming of Hezbollah and removal of Hezbollah forces from south of the Litani River, and the cessation of fighting along the Israeli-Lebanese frontier. The proposed committee would be led by an American military officer, who would be joined by a French counterpart. Furthermore, the American proposal would back Israel's demand for a right to respond militarily in Lebanon should the ceasefire be violated, but only after the aforementioned committee is given an opportunity to reestablish calm.

‘Anarchist AG declared war on the government’ – Officials	Attorney General's inaction in the face of violent left-wing protests has caused 'unprecedented damage to the rule of law and public order,' says minister. By World Israel News Government ministers and other coalition lawmakers are raising the alarm about what they say is the illegal intervention of Attorney General Gali Baharav Miara in government matters, with many calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fire her. The demand for Baharav Miara's ouster comes on the heels of a recent decision from her office that Public Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir - whose ministry includes Israel's police - does not have the right to dictate police policies, nor replace the head of the police. Netanyahu should fire Ben Gvir if he does not stop attempting to change police policy and appointing senior figures within the force, Baharav Miara wrote. In response, Ben Gvir said on Monday that Baharav Miara 'has declared war on the government.' 'Pay attention, my fellow ministers, to what they are asking the prime minister to fire me for: because I backed our soldiers, because I spoke out against [Arab Joint List MKs] Ahmad Tibi and Ofer Cassif, because I criticized the courts,' Ben Gvir said. Baharav Miara is 'essentially the most dangerous person to the State of Israel,' Regional Cooperation Minister David Amsalem told Hebrew-language news site Kikar HaShabbat. The minister referenced ongoing incitement against Netanyahu, including an incident on Saturday night which saw anti-government demonstrators fire flares at the premier's residence, sparking a fire. 'She allows the left to run wild, to do whatever it wants,' Amsalem added. Communications Minister Dr. Shlomi Karhi noted that Baharav Miara had not clamped down on increasingly intense incitement against Netanyahu, and that her negligence could potentially lead to the prime minister's murder. 'The attorney general must go home today,' Karhi said in the Knesset plenum. 'If someone comes to kill you — including through weakness and agreement through silence — rise up and fire them,' he said, referencing a Talmudic self-defense ruling which says one should kill an aggressor in self-defense. Diaspora Miniter Amichai Chikli wrote on social media platform X that Baharav Miara's inaction in the face of violent left-wing protests has caused 'unprecedented damage to the rule of law and public order.' Chikli added that 'in her serial disregard of wild incitement, she is a silent accomplice. The State of Israel cannot afford to have an anarchist in the post of legal adviser.'

Hunting Jews in broad daylight: Europe’s new reality	Daniel Levy, a lifelong resident of Amsterdam, says ‘What we’re facing is far more than harassment—it’s a full-blown pogrom.’ By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News Amsterdam, a city that once symbolized tolerance and freedom, is now a battleground where Jews are hunted in the streets, targeted by violent mobs, and abandoned by their own government. Let’s call this what it is: a pogrom. The Jewish community is under siege, and the world is silent. This isn’t just neglect—it’s complicity. At Paradiso, one of Amsterdam’s most iconic concert venues, the depths of antisemitism were on full display. On November 12, 2024, a performer praised the so-called '#Jodenjacht'—a reference to the violent targeting of Jews—while the audience responded with enthusiastic applause. A room filled with cheers for a modern-day 'Jew hunt.' This chilling moment encapsulates the normalization of antisemitic violence in Europe and signals the breakdown of any pretense of safety for Jews in Amsterdam. Daniel Levy, a lifelong resident of Amsterdam, doesn’t mince words. 'What we’re facing is far more than harassment—it’s a full-blown pogrom,' he says. 'Fireworks were strategically exploded near hotels and Airbnbs known to host Jewish and Israeli visitors. Groups of Moroccan Muslims roamed the streets, stopping anyone they believed to be Jewish or Israeli, demanding identification.' This isn’t random chaos. This is organized, targeted violence. Cab drivers exposed Jewish tourists’ locations online, making it easy for mobs to attack them. Some Israelis were driven far from their destinations and dropped off in dangerous areas, where gangs were lying in wait. Incredibly, attackers even traveled from Germany to join in the mayhem. Amsterdam, a supposed safe haven, has become a death trap for anyone visibly Jewish. The Police: Protectors or Enablers? Where were the police during this pogrom? Busy harassing Jews trying to defend themselves. According to Levy, some officers openly displayed 'Free Palestine' stickers, a glaring symbol of their sympathies. This isn’t just negligence; it’s betrayal. Take the case of Philip Zeitler Prins, a Jewish resident who has endured harassment for over three years. His home has been defaced with Palestinian flags and hateful graffiti, and threats are a regular occurrence. After years of pleading, a police officer finally visited his home—not to protect him, but to inspect the flags. Despite clear evidence of harassment, law enforcement refused to take action, citing a lack of 'definitive proof.' They wouldn’t even question the neighbors. Zeitler Prins recorded the entire interaction, exposing the police’s cowardice. This isn’t law enforcement; it’s law abandonment. Politicians Fueling the Fire The failure isn’t limited to the police—it goes all the way to the top. Amsterdam’s political leaders are not just passive; they’re active participants in this crisis. GreenLeft council members openly chant slogans like 'From the river to the sea,' a call for Israel’s destruction. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations, supposedly banned, continue with full permission from city officials. The message is clear: Amsterdam’s leadership will protect hate speech over human lives. Silence Is Complicity Where are Amsterdam’s non-Jewish residents? Silent. And that silence speaks volumes. Instead of standing with their Jewish neighbors, many align with the pro-Palestinian narrative, even when it devolves into outright antisemitism. The city is now plastered with pro-Hamas banners and graffiti calling for intifada. 'If a Jewish resident tears down a Palestinian flag, it’s seen as provocative,' Levy explains. 'But these hate symbols are defended as free speech, while the very real danger we face every day is ignored.' This isn’t ignorance. This is willful blindness. Fighting Back: Betar Leads the Charge While Amsterdam’s leaders fail, others are stepping up. Ron Torossian, Chairman of Betar USA, is leading the charge to protect Jewish communities. 'Betar is built on the principles of Ze’ev Jabotinsky: fight or flee in the face of oppression. We choose to fight,' Torossian declares. Betar is organizing rallies, building alliances, and mobilizing communities across Europe to counter antisemitism head-on. 'We’re not just reacting; we’re creating a sustained movement of Jewish pride and resilience,' Torossian says. 'We refuse to back down.' Time for Real Action Here’s the hard truth: Antisemitism is no longer simmering beneath the surface—it’s boiling over. Amsterdam is a litmus test for Europe’s future, and right now, it’s failing. Steven Spielberg and Adam Sandler, both celebrated figures who have capitalized on their Jewish identity in their work—Spielberg through documenting the Holocaust in Schindler’s List and Sandler through his public celebration of Jewish pride—remain conspicuously silent in the face of the growing crisis facing Jews in Amsterdam and beyond. Their silence is particularly glaring given their influence and platforms, which could bring much-needed attention to the dire threat of Islamic antisemitism and government apathy. Betar, a global Zionist organization, is holding rallies in front of their homes to call on them to break their silence and stand in solidarity with the Jewish communities under siege. As Ze’ev Jabotinsky once said, ‘Silence is despicable,’ and in times like these, silence from prominent Jewish figures is not just disappointing—it’s dangerous. Europe’s Jews are standing at a precipice, and the international community must decide: Will you watch another Holocaust unfold, or will you act now? The choice is stark and unforgiving. Antisemitism isn’t freedom of speech. It’s not a political opinion. It’s hatred, plain and simple—and hatred, when left unchecked, metastasizes into violence. If the world allows Amsterdam to become a breeding ground for pogroms, the question won’t be if it spreads but when. This is not just a Jewish issue. This is a human issue. To every leader, influencer, and policymaker: the time for neutrality has passed. If you refuse to speak up, history will remember your silence as complicity. In the words of Ze’ev Jabotinsky: 'Silence is despicable.' Stand with the Jewish people, or stand on the wrong side of history. We will not apologize. We will not retreat. And we will not forget who stood with us—and who didn’t.

Hamas hosted by Turkey after being kicked out of Qatar	Qatar, where Hamas' operations had been based for years, recently came under intense American pressure to expel the terror group from its territory. By World Israel News Staff Turkey has warmly welcomed Hamas' senior leadership after the terror group's officials were forced out of Qatar, according to Hebrew-language media reports. Qatar, where Hamas' operations had been based for years, recently came under intense American pressure to expel the terror group from its territory. Earlier in November, Washington told Qatar to eject Hamas leaders from the country, due to the terror group rejected hostage deals numerous times and murdering several captives, including American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Doha announced that it would no longer serve as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, citing the stalled negotiations for a deal that would see a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the release of the nearly 100 hostages still held in Gaza. Hebrew-language media reported that the terror group's top brass were asked to leave Qatar, though they weren't given a specific deadline by which they needed to depart. According to a Times of Israel report, many of Hamas' most important surviving politburo members are establishing a new base of operations in Ankara. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly praised Hamas and stressed that his country will remain friendly towards the terror group. 'No one can make us qualify Hamas as a terrorist organization,' he said during a March speech in Istanbul. 'Turkey is a country that speaks openly with Hamas leaders and firmly backs them.' In April, Erdogan hosted the now-assassinated head of Hamas' politburo, Ismail Haniyeh, in Istanbul. During the hours-long meeting, 'President Erdogan stated that Palestinians’ acting in unison is of vital importance during this time, that the most robust response to Israel and the way to victory go through unity and integrity, and that Palestine’s rightful cause and facts be communicated more effectively against Israel, which misleads international public opinion,' according to a summary posted by the Turkish Directorate of Communications in a post on social media platform X.

Comparing Trump to Hitler is an ‘insult’ to millions of Jews, say...	New York's Democratic mayor tussles with hosts of The View over the incendiary political rhetoric on the Left likening President-elect Donald Trump to Hitler and Fascists of the 1930s. By World Israel News Staff New York City Mayor Eric Adams urged fellow Democrats last week to tone down their rhetoric and protested attempts to compare former President and President-elect Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler and to members of fascist movements of the 1930s and 1940s. Adams, who is currently under indictment for bribery and campaign finance violations, appeared on ABC's 'The View' Friday to call for more bipartisan cooperation and less incendiary political rhetoric. In particular, Adams took aim at extreme denunciations of Trump on the Left. Questioned co-host Sunny Hostin regarding allegations that his recent public statements rejecting comparisons between Trump and World War II-era fascists were motivated by a desire to secure a presidential pardon from the incoming president. Ahead of the November election, Adams criticized Vice President Kamala Harris after she responded to the question of whether she considered Trump to be a fascist. 'Yes, I do,' Harris said. 'I have heard those terms hurled at me by some political leaders in the city, using terms like Hitler and fascist. My answer is no, I know what Hitler has done, and I know what a fascist regime looks like,' Adams said in late October. Speaking with The View Friday, Adams doubled down on his denial of wrong-doing, while castigating attempts to compare political rivals to Nazi leaders. 'We reached a point in this country where we no longer want to engage in conversation. They were even calling him Hitler,' Adams lamented. 'That was an insult to the millions of Jews and others who died — we know what Hitler did and what I said to our country when I’m on the streets talking to my young people who are protesting on college campuses [with] Hamas signs and calling for the destruction of groups, I said we have to bring down this rhetoric,' he said. 'We have to start engaging in conversation. You know Obama said it right and I agreed. This is not the divided states, this is the United States. We are the greatest country on the globe and people are watching us name-calling.'

Suicide drone from Iraq launched towards southern Israeli city of...	Israeli interceptor missile failed to hit incoming Iraqi drone targeting Eilat, landed in Jordan. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An Iron Dome interceptor fell near Aqaba in Jordan Sunday night after failing to hit its target, an incoming UAV from Iraq. Jordanian news agency Petra reported its military’s confirmation that a 'flying object' had hit in the coastal city, which is located just several hundreds of meters from Eilat at Israel’s southern tip. It reported that there no serious injuries or damage resulted from the subsequent impact. Sappers then arrived to take care of the dangerous debris and citizens were told not to approach the area. Videos uploaded to social media show the interceptor descending outside the Ayla inlet, a luxury development in Aqaba, and two explosions could be heard, one right after the other. The first was seemingly the detonation of the anti-missile’s head that was to have hit the UAV aiming to cause destruction in Eilat, and the second was the result of the interceptor hitting the ground. For its part, the IDF announced that when the incoming missile was discovered, 'several interceptors were launched towards the target. One of them fell in an open space. No reports of casualties were received and the incident is being investigated.' One or more of the other interceptors had hit the target successfully, destroying the threat before it reached Israel’s borders, the army added. Some Eilat residents took to Facebook to complain that they had first heard two very strong, loud explosions and only then the warning siren had sounded in the town. Others said that after the siren went off, they heard another two explosions, seemingly confirming that after the first interceptor went astray, a second had worked as it should. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella network of Iranian-backed Shiite Islamist terrorist groups, claimed responsibility for launching the drone. These groups have arsenals composed of cruise missiles, kamikaze drones and rockets of Iranian origin. They have been launching their long-range missiles sporadically at Israel since November 2023 in support of their fellow Iranian proxy, Hamas, in its war against Israel. A few have managed to get through Israel’s air defense. Notably, last month a drone launched from Iraq killed two Israeli soldiers and injured 24, two of them seriously, in an army base on the Golan Heights in northern Israel.

US will sanction ICC if it pursues Netanyahu arrest, incoming Sen...	Senator John Thune, the next Majority Leader of the Senate, warned the International Criminal Court that the US will impose sanctions on the court if it moves forward with plans to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israel's former defense minister. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The next leader of the upper chamber of the U.S. Congress warned the International Criminal Court at The Hague Sunday that the United States will impose sanctions on the tribunal should it insist on moving forward with plans to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. South Dakota Senator John Thune took to X/Twitter Sunday, penning a scathing post, castigating the ICC and chief prosecutor Karim Khan over their 'outrageous' bid to pursue the arrests of Netanyahu and Gallant. 'If the ICC and its prosecutor do not reverse their outrageous and unlawful actions to pursue arrest warrants against Israeli officials, the Senate should immediately pass sanctions legislation, as the House has already done on a bipartisan basis,' Thune tweeted. 'If Majority Leader Schumer does not act, the Senate Republican majority will stand with our key ally Israel and make this – and other supportive legislation – a top priority in the next Congress.' Thune, who currently serves as Senate Minority Whip, is set to replace Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell as head of the Republican Senate Caucus on January 3rd, as the 119th Congress begins its two-year session. With Republicans having picked up a total of four seats in the Senate, giving them a 53-47 majority in the upper chamber, Thune will also become Senate Majority Leader on January 3rd, replacing the incumbent, New York Democrat Chuck Schumer. Hours after Thune's tweet, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson noted that the lower chamber of Congress passed a measure to sanction the ICC in June, adding that under Schumer, the Senate had yet to take up the proposal. 'The House voted in JUNE to sanction the ICC if they proceed with their illegitimate plot, but Chuck Schumer has refused to bring the bill up in the Senate,' Johnson tweeted. 'Grateful to see the resolve of Sen John Thune for BOTH of our chambers to stand TOGETHER with Israel in the new Congress.'

‘Totally surreal,’ Jewish Arizonan wins $1 million from Elon Musk...	Offenhartz’s plans for the windfall include charitable giving to Big Brothers, the Jewish National Fund, and to Jewish education in Phoenix. By Dave Gordon, JNS After Joshua Offenhartz decided to sign a petition from Elon Musk’s America Political Action Committee, which offered a potential $47 per referral and a shot at $1 million for those in battleground states, he sent it in a group text to family and friends. 'They loved it, but they thought I was crazy,' the Jewish lawyer in Phoenix told JNS. Signatories to the petition state that they support constitutional principles, with a particular focus on free expression and gun ownership rights. 'I read it. I largely agreed that we need the First Amendment to protect our freedoms of speech, our freedoms of religion,' said Offenhartz, who received the petition in September. 'As an attorney, I believe in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments—the right to protection and privacy, the right to due process.' 'It’s election season, so I sort of sign-up for everything because you never know where interesting information is going to come from that you share with family and friends,' he told JNS. On Nov. 3, Offenhartz was on a walk with his children, sharing literature for local Arizona candidates when he received a text message from an unknown number informing him that America PAC would be in his neighborhood that day. It wanted to 'stop by and say, ‘Thank you for the work you did.’' Offenhartz’s wife, Shira Offenhartz, thought the family was in the money, but the attorney didn’t want either of them to get their hopes up. Then a large SUV pulled up in front of the house, a team got out and someone opened the trunk and revealed an oversized check.

'That made it very real.' 'That really solidified any advocacy that I may have been wavering on growing up,' Offenhartz said. In 2007, he returned to Israel to mark Hillel’s 75th anniversary, and in 2013, he led a Birthright contingent. On the latter trip, the group left a tour of Yad Vashem in Jerusalem when Jerusalem was struck by rocket fire. It ran into the museum’s parking garage basement shelter.

Hamas supporters lay siege to British banking giant over Israel s...	The unruly mob also harassed customers by urging them to close their accounts. By Jewish Breaking News Barclays Bank faced widespread disruption on Saturday as hundreds of Hamas supporters besieged branches throughout the UK, demanding the bank sever its financial ties with Israel. According to the Telegraph, the most significant disruption occurred in Brighton where dozens of anti-Israel protesters forced the branch to shut its doors after blocking the bank’s entrance with a banner reading 'Stop Arming Israel.' The unruly mob also harassed customers by urging them to close their accounts. While some bank locations maintained operations under the watchful eye of police and security guards, the demonstrations organized by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) spread across multiple cities, including a notable gathering in Brent, where a dozen protesters occupied the entrance while displaying 'Free Palestine' banners. Similar scenes played out in Glasgow, Leeds, Oxford, and Coventry. The PSC has accused Barclays of 'bankrolling Israel’s genocidal assault on Palestinians,' alleging the bank has invested more than £2 billion in arms companies selling weapons to Israel, while providing additional financial services worth £6.1 billion. In response, Barclays defended its position, maintaining it is 'committed to respecting human rights.' 'As a universal bank, Barclays provides a range of client services in relation to the shares of publicly listed companies, including those in the defense and security sector,' a statement by Barclays reads. 'Barclays is committed to respecting human rights as defined by the International Bill of Human Rights and takes account of other internationally accepted human rights standards and frameworks. 'We have a published statement on defense and security which sets out our policy positions and governs any business activities in the defense and security sector, including setting restrictions on certain financing activities and requiring enhanced due diligence as appropriate on clients in the sector.'

IDF eliminates Hezbollah media chief in Beirut strike	In October, Afif boasted, 'It won't be long before we take Israeli captives.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An Israeli strike in central Beirut killed a Hezbollah media chief on Sunday, Reuters reports. Mohammad Afif, who served as the long-time media advisor to the deceased head of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in the Ras al-Nabaa neighborhood of Beirut. The strike targeted the Ba'ath Party offices in Lebanon, and the head of the party, Ali Hijazi, told the Lebanese media that Afif was dead. Before the strike, IDF Arab Media Spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted on X/Twitter a map of places Israel was planning to target. The post was intended for civilians in the Haret Hreik and Burj al-Barajneh areas as an evacuation notice. Reuters reported that civilians in the Ras al-Nabaa did not receive evacuation orders. In addition to serving as media adviser to Nasrallah, Mohammed Afif ran the Al-Manar television station before taking over the media office. In October, Afif boasted, 'It won't be long before we take Israeli captives.' Although he acknowledged that Hezbollah did not have Israeli hostages, he said the terror organization 'came close' to kidnapping Israelis. He also said that Hezbollah was 'only in the first round' as the IDF fought terrorists in Southern Lebanon. A security official told Maariv that eliminating Afif has 'significant implications.' 'Firstly, such an action deals a mortal blow to the Shia population and Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon,' he explained. 'In addition, it could further impair the organization's ability to influence the Lebanese public and operate with its own members. This individual was responsible for propaganda, conveying messages, and was a dominant figure for the organization's leadership and in engaging with the Lebanese public,' the official said. IDF reported that the air force had carried out 'intelligence-based strikes on six Hezbollah military targets' in the Dahieh area. The IDF also targeted weapons storage facilities, command centers, and military sites.

Israeli breakthrough could halve radiation sessions for prostate ...	The study aims not only to improve patient experience but also to optimize healthcare resources. By Pesach Benson, TPS An Israeli medical breakthrough could cut in half the number of radiation treatments needed for prostate cancer patients. Prostate cancer remains one of the most common malignancies among men worldwide, with approximately 2,500 new cases diagnosed annually in Israel. Half of these are detected early, when radiation therapy is a highly effective treatment option. However, the current standard of five sessions requires significant time, preparation, and emotional resilience from patients. Research conducted by doctors at the Davidoff Comprehensive Cancer Center at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering high-dose external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer in just two sessions, without compromising safety or outcomes. 'Reducing the number of radiation treatments from five to two can significantly ease the physical and emotional toll on patients, making the treatment process more tolerable,' said Dr. Elisha Fredman, who led the research. 'Treating patients more efficiently also allows them to start therapy sooner, benefiting everyone involved.' Fredman drew inspiration from a more invasive approach called brachytherapy. This technique involves the surgical implantation of radioactive particles into the prostate, effectively treating the cancer in just two sessions. Building on this concept, Dr. Fredman developed a non-invasive alternative using external beam radiation, delivering high doses over two sessions instead of five. The study aims not only to improve patient experience but also to optimize healthcare resources. By shortening treatment schedules, the hospital can treat more patients and reduce waiting times, all while minimizing long-term side effects. Although similar studies are underway in New York, London, and Toronto, Fredman’s study is expected to surpass these in scale, marking a significant milestone in global cancer research. Since the study’s inception, more than 40 patients have participated, with promising results. 'The response to treatment has been excellent so far, with no unusual side effects,' Fredman reported.

Oct. 7th victims’ families sue Iran for supporting Hamas	The families are seeking financial compensation from Iran under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Anti-Terrorism Act. By World Israel News Staff The families of victims murdered in the October 7th terror onslaught are suing Iran in an American court, presenting previously-unseen evidence that the Islamic Republic was directly involved in supporting the plan for the massacre. The suit, filed in Washington D.C. Federal Court by those whose relatives held U.S. citizenship, charges that Iran had advanced direct knowledge of the October 7th plan and provided extensive funding to Hamas for the attack. Documents presented in the lawsuit, which appear to have been obtained directly from Hamas leadership, detailed how a prominent Iranian military commander had met with a senior Hamas official just months before the attack. The Iranian official assured his Hamas counterpart that Tehran would fully support the slaughter. The terror group's slain leader, Yahya Sinwar, demanded that Iran funnel Hamas $7 million on a monthly basis for the upcoming 'big project' - a code name for the October 7th murder, rape, kidnapping, and mutilation spree. 'Hard, incontrovertible evidence of who funded Hamas is now becoming available in the form of documents, bank records and the like, and we intend to hold those parties accountable, in the courts of the United States or elsewhere, for however long it takes,' said attorneys Gary Osen and Lee Wolosky, who are leading the case, said in a statement. The families are seeking financial compensation from Iran under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Anti-Terrorism Act. All the groups named in the lawsuit, which include Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are all officially designated as terror organizations by the U.S. government. 46 Americans were murdered by Hamas on October 7th, including children, babies, and elderly people. 12 were taken hostage to Gaza, where seven remain today. Three of those American hostages are confirmed to be dead.

Kushner to serve as informal Trump Mideast adviser	Kushner’s close ties to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as well as to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could allow for more private contacts. By JNS President-elect Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner will reportedly play an important role in U.S. Middle East policy, even though he will not formally be part of the administration. Regional diplomats and Trump allies recognize that Kushner—who has significant financial interests in the Gulf—has forged deep relationships from his position as a senior White House adviser during the first Trump administration, CNN reported on Friday. 'No one on the incoming team has what Jared has, and that is trust. Jared earned it, he didn’t have it at the beginning. He earned it. That takes time to build,' said a diplomat from a Middle Eastern nation. 'Friendships are forever in this region,' an Israeli source who dealt with the first Trump administration told CNN. 'My assumption is that his role is much more in his hands than anybody else’s.' After President Joe Biden took office four years ago, Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, moved to Florida and largely avoided politics. He founded an investment fund shortly after leaving Washington with major backing from sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf, including $2 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Kushner’s close ties to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as well as to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could allow for more private contacts, the report noted. The second Trump administration is certain to make the expansion of the landmark 2020 Abraham Accords, which Kushner spearheaded, a cornerstone of its Middle East program with a push toward reaching a historic normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia expected to be front and center of U.S. foreign policy efforts next year.

Israel security agency chief says firing flares at Netanyahu’s re...	Ronen Bar: 'The firing of flash bombs at the residence of the prime minister is the gravest kind of incident and is far from legitimate protest.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Ronen Bar, head of Israel's Security Agency (Shin Bet) said that those who fired flares at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea will be dealt with severely and the incident shows a 'dangerous level' of activism. After three people were arrested in connection with the firing of flares at the Prime Minister's residence in the early hours of Sunday morning, Ronen Bar said, 'The firing of flash bombs at the residence of the prime minister is the gravest kind of incident and is far from legitimate protest.' 'This is rising to dangerous levels' of activism, he added. Bar said that Shin Bet is required by law to protect symbols of the Israeli government, such as the Prime Minister's residence, and that violent acts against these symbols would not be tolerated. He said, 'We acted promptly with the police to identify and arrest those suspects involved in the incident, using all the tools at our disposal.' Shin Bet and Lahav 433 investigated the incident shortly after it occurred and called it a 'dangerous escalation.' No members of the Netanyahu family were home during the flares' firing, and no damage was reported to the home. The incident drew strong criticism from members of the government and members of the Opposition. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and National Unity chairman Benny Gantz strongly condemned the incident and said those responsible should be brought to justice. Yisrael Beytenu chief Avigdor Liberman said it 'signifies an escalation in the attempt to harm the democratic institutions of the State of Israel.' 'Full backing must be given to the Shin Bet and the Israel Police in the investigation, and those involved must be brought to justice,' Liberman added. President Isaac Herzog said he had spoken to the Shin Bet chief about 'the urgent need to investigate and deal with those responsible for the incident as soon as possible.' 'The flames must not be allowed to escalate. I am again warning against increased violence in the public sphere,' Herzog wrote.

Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk told The Press Service of Israel he praised the symbolism of what the move represents. 'The Ukrainian reaction is positive, but in order to make such a decision, you don’t need Knesset laws,' Korniychuk told TPS-IL. According to the ambassador, if the goal was simply to transfer the weapons discretely, this could be done by the Israeli Minister of Defense alone, without the need for Knesset legislation. 'This [Knesset legislation] was to make it more public,' Korniychuk said. 'I’ve already heard all these ideas of not provoking Russia. But given everything, Russia hosting Hamas leaders, supplying Hezbollah with weapons, and more, what else can you provoke?' 'We have the same enemy, Iran, Russia, and the Iranian proxies,' he added. The bill, which has been placed on the Knesset table for early discussion, specifically allows for weaponry confiscated during military operations, in Lebanon and in territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority, to the Ukrainian armed forces. The legislation is being spearheaded by Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel and MK Dan Ilouz. Based on photos and videos released by the Israel Defense Forces, the seized Russian arms include Kornet anti-tank guided missiles, Strela shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, RPG-29 Vampire and RPG-27 Tavolga rocket-propelled grenade launchers, Metis-M anti-tank missile systems, and MRO-A rocket-propelled anti-personnel flamethrowers. Also confiscated were stockpiles of Kalashnikov rifles. It isn’t clear if the weapons were directly provided by Russia or delivered by third parties. Under the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Gottheimer announces bid for NJ governor	As New Jersey’s only Jewish congressional representative, Gottheimer has been recognized by Jewish groups for his efforts to promote Holocaust education and combatting antisemitism. By Andrew Bernard, JNS Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) announced his bid for the New Jersey governor’s office on Friday, joining a crowded Democratic field to replace term-limited Gov. Tim Murphy (D) in the 2025 election. Gottheimer, who is Jewish and one of Israel’s staunchest advocates on Capitol Hill, announced his candidacy at Runway Diner in South Hackensack with a focus on lowering the cost of living in the Garden State. 'Life in Jersey has become too damn expensive,' Gottheimer said. 'Today, I’m launching my campaign for governor to cut your taxes and costs and to make Jersey affordable again.' Gottheimer has represented New Jersey’s 5th Congressional District along the northern border with New York since he won the seat from a Republican incumbent in 2016. He handily won re-election on Nov. 5 by an 11-point margin. As New Jersey’s only Jewish congressional representative, Gottheimer has been recognized by Jewish groups for his efforts to promote Holocaust education and has been one of the leading voices in the House on combating antisemitism and supporting Israel. 'We need to bring the full force of the law against the antisemites who are harassing Jewish or any other communities all over this state,' Gottheimer said in his announcement speech, adding that he supports putting more cops on the beat. Other Democrats, who have announced their intention to run for the governor’s office, include Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop (who is Jewish), with Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) reportedly set to announce her candidacy later this week. Long thought of as a Democratic bastion that occasionally elects Republican moderates, New Jersey has emerged as a more competitive battleground in statewide races in recent elections. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris beat President-elect Donald Trump in the state by just five points in November, and Gov. Murphy beat his Republican challenger in the 2021 election by a 51-48 margin. That challenger, former New Jersey General Assembly member Jack Ciattarelli, is once again seeking the Republican nomination alongside five other declared contenders. Gottheimer in his announcement promised to do 'battle' with Trump over issues like the state and local tax deduction, while also touting his bipartisan record as a co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus. 'The election outcome was a horrible loss for America,' Gottheimer said in a video accompanying his announcement. 'Every candidate running for governor agrees we need to stand up to Trump on the major issues.' Trump, who capped the SALT deduction as part of his 2017 tax cuts, pledged in the 2024 campaign that he would lift the cap in a social media post aimed at voters on Long Island. 'I will turn it around, get SALT back, lower your taxes and so much more,' Trump wrote. Other key issues in the New Jersey gubernatorial race include New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s plan to impose a $9 congestion charge on drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street starting in January, potentially affecting a huge number of New Jersey commuters and businesses. Gottheimer vowed to defeat the toll charge. 'To our friends in the Empire State, let me say this: We beat New York’s outrageous Congestion Tax once,' he said. 'I’m ready to lead the fight to stop it again.' Today, I’m launching my campaign for Governor to lower your taxes, lower your costs, and to make Jersey affordable again. I will help you and your family get ahead and I’ll do it while protecting our Jersey Values. pic.twitter.com/XrZm595yD4 &mdash; Josh Gottheimer (@Josh4Jersey) November 15, 2024 The post Gottheimer announces bid for NJ governor appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/gottheimer-announces-bid-for-nj-governor/	2024-11-17T08:32:52-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/shutterstock_2201068997-scaled.jpg
‘A miracle’ – None injured as missile destroys Haifa synagogue	The missile hit exactly where we pray,' says regular worshipper at Avot v'Banim synagogue. By World Israel News Staff A historic synagogue with an active congregation was destroyed by a Hezbollah missile on Saturday night, just a few hours after prayers were held in the building. The Avot v'Banim synagogue in Haifa's central Carmel neighborhood was directly struck by the rocket, with dozens of nearby apartments damaged by shrapnel and numerous cars set ablaze by the blast. 'We had a great miracle. Two hours before [the rocket hit] we were still praying here in the synagogue. Look what happened to us here,' Gershon Zaft, a regular worshipper at the synagogue, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'It's a great miracle that there are no casualties,' Zaft stressed. 'The missile hit exactly where we pray. It will take a long time to rebuild our synagogue.' Clips ciruclating on social media of the scene showed that the synagogue's roof was completely destroyed, with much of the structure appearing to implode. 'The destruction is extensive,' Gideon Goldenbar, the synagogue's gabbay (caretaker), told Ynet. 'We hope that we will be able to salvage some Torah scrolls.' The efforts to retrieve Torah scrolls and other holy objects from the synagogue are complicated by the huge amount of debris and the weather, as a rainstorm is expected in the coming days. The synagogue is located in a historic Templar-style building, erected in the 1800s by Germans in Ottoman-era Israel. The missile strike comes on the heels of reports that Israel and Lebanon are nearing a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict. While Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar recently confirmed that Israel is 'closer than ever' to reaching a diplomatic agreement that would see Hezbollah stop its daily rocket, missile, and explosive drone attacks against Israel, the timeline for such a deal remains unclear.

Pope Francis calls for genocide investigation of Israel	After calling Israel's wars against Hamas and Hezbollah terror groups 'immoral,' the Vatican pontiff is now calling for a probe into the IDF's conduct, citing accusations 'by some experts' that ongoing war has 'characteristics of genocide.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Pope Francis has called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by IDF forces during the ongoing wars against the Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, according to an upcoming book. On Sunday, the Italian daily La Stampa published excerpts from Hernán Reyes Alcaide's new book, Hope Never Disappoints. Pilgrims Towards a Better World, which is set to be released on Tuesday. Among the excerpts published Tuesday were quotes attributed to the Vatican pontiff in which he is said to have cited claims by 'some experts' accusing Israel of genocide, and backing an investigation of IDF war conduct. 'According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,' Pope Francis is quoted as saying. 'We should investigate carefully to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.' Pope Francis has already publicly castigated Israel's war against Hamas and Hezbollah, calling the IDF's actions 'excessive' and 'immoral.' 'Defense must always be proportionate to the attack,' the pope told reporters on September 29th. 'When there is something disproportionate, one shows a tendency to dominate which goes beyond what is moral,' he continued. Even operations which are essentially defensive can be 'immoral actions' if they are 'excessive,' Pope Francis argued. Later on Sunday, the Combat Antisemitism Movement slammed Pope Francis' remarks, comparing it to the historic 'Inquisitions.' 'The State of Israel is currently facing a war of intended annihilation on seven fronts, and these remarks look like a possible opening of an eighth front, from of all places, the Vatican, which can also lead to the spilling of Jewish blood around the world,' said CAM CEO Sacha Roytman Dratwa. 'For a Pope who appears to prize even-handedness and peace, we see that the Jewish State once again appears to be the exception.' 'We had hoped after Nostra Aetate in 1965 that the Jewish People would be seen as equal to all others around the world by the Catholic hierarchy, but these claims suggest otherwise, and out of all the conflicts and real genocides around the world, the national homeland of the Jewish people is once again singled out as a target for opprobrium.' 'The Catholic Church has a very troubling history of investigations into the conduct of Jews, which were frequently called Inquisitions,' continued Roytman Dratwa. 'It would behoove Pope Francis to choose his words more carefully because they bring to mind a horrific and bloody history of Catholic religious leaders attacking Jews for the enjoyment of others in public at tribunals and Inquisitions where the Jew would always be found guilty regardless of the facts.'

Following uproar, Canadian ceremony honoring October 7th architec...	Canadian organization walks back plans to hold memorial vigil in honor of Yahya Sinwar, the late Hamas leader and mastermind behind the October 7th massacres. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A far-left Canadian organization has nixed plans to hold a public event honoring the late chief of the Hamas terror organization and mastermind behind the October 7th massacres, after a public backlash against the gathering. On Saturday, the Canadian Defenders of Human Rights (CD4HR) issued a statement announcing that it has canceled the planned November 26th memorial vigil in the Toronto-area city of Mississauga honoring Yahya Sinwar. 'CD4HR has decided to cancel the November 26 Vigil for the Great Martyr Yahya Sinwar, our Mandela, due to several reasons - primarily the security and safety of our city Mississauga.' The group added, however, that it had not been 'intimidated' into cancelling the planned event. 'CD4HR has consulted the city of Mississauga and we have been assured that we can practice our Charter on Rights and Freedoms and we'll keep you posted on the next event.' 'Lest the Pro-Israel lobbies and their supporters think they intimidated us in any way. Freedom for Palestine.' Earlier this month, flyers advertising the planned gathering spark a row in Mississauga, after residents objected to the holding of a public memorial at city hall's Celebration Square. Mayor Carolyn Parrish came under fire after she refused to bar organizers from using the public square for the vigil, defending the event on the grounds of free speech. Later, Parrish appeared to suggest that the ads were part of an elaborate hoax. 'Consulted a network of Muslim organizations, serious partners in many activities of our city – coaching sports, walkathons for Trillium Hospital and diabetes. I asked them to track down the anonymous notice for a vigil at City Hall. No organization exists. No vigil is planned,' the mayor tweeted. Parrish later defended the planned vigil during a city council meeting last Wednesday, downplaying Sinwar's terrorist activities and comparing him to Nelson Mandela. 'I just want to point out — and I’m not being facetious — Nelson Mandela was declared a terrorist by the United States of America until the year 2008. Your terrorist and somebody else’s terrorist may be two different things,' Parrish said according to a report by The National Post.

‘Greatest merit in the world’ – IDF reservist Idan Keinan killed ...	Keinan had written his grandmother just two months ago that it would be 'the greatest merit in the world' to die for his country. Sgt. Maj. (res.) Idan Keinan was killed Saturday in the northern Gaza Strip by a sniper, the IDF announced Sunday after informing his family. According to Channel 14 military affairs reporter Noam Amir, the actions of the sniper were typical of how Hamas operates now in Gaza. 'We’re simply talking about a terrorist, a mouse who lives underground, comes out of his tunnel, shoots, and flees,' he noted on the Yisrael Haboker (Israel This Morning) show. 'This is basically now the reality,' he said, as 'Hamas has stopped existing as a military organization in the Strip and the terrorists are mainly operating as small guerrilla units who are sent out to commit sporadic terror attacks.' The 21-year-old from Ramat Gan was part of the Nachshon Battalion in the Kfir Brigade, operating in Beit Lahia on the outskirts of the major town of Jabalia that has been the focus of the IDF’s attention in recent weeks, with over a thousand Hamas terrorists captured and another thousand killed, according to the IDF. He is survived by his parents, a brother and a sister, Linoy, who wrote in a social media post that Keinan had 'died as a hero,' but that she 'will never manage to get over a loss such as you.' 'I can’t believe that you left me like that and went to Heaven, my beloved brother,' she wrote, describing him as 'the most good-hearted boy in the world' and asking him to 'protect us from above.' She also posted a letter that her brother had written to his grandmother two months ago about his strong feelings for his country and people. After talking of two soldiers who had recently been killed in action, he noted that they died 'for the country and we all know it&#8230;and are happy to be here instead of the civilians and the country that we so love.' 'Know that no matter what happens I &#8230; know exactly what I’m doing and where I am,' he wrote in part. 'I know what the risks are and what can happen and I am at peace with it. Moreover, this is the path that I have chosen and this is the path that I believe every man in the country should choose. There aren’t – and never will be – anyone else to protect us but us.' 'If our Father in Heaven decides that someone needs to die for our people, it’s the greatest merit in the world,' he added. Keinan had posted to Instagram last October 7 when Hamas invaded Israel, slaughtering 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, triggering his call-up, that 'No one here will sleep until you [all] feel safe, I promise you.' Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shama Cohen, called the fallen soldier 'an angel and brave sharpshooter' who was 'suffused with love of country and the Jewish people&#8230;. We in the municipality will do all we can to hug and strengthen the precious family.'

The Syrian journalist promoting peace with Israel	Hayvi Bouzo works from the U.S., knowing she is considered a traitor by many in her home country. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hayvi Bouzo is a Syrian journalist trying to promote peace between Israel and the Arab world by using her online platform, which is based in the U.S. because her views make her a traitor in the eyes of many in her home country. The atrocities Hamas-led terrorists committed during their invasion of Israel last October 7 galvanized her to bring the Israeli side of the war to over three quarters of a million followers who watch her weekly podcasts on Yalla, a show she cofounded to 'counteract the deep-seated rhetoric that incites violence, antisemitism, and hatred' in the Middle East, as she told The Jerusalem Post in a March interview. Bouzo has interviewed many Israelis so far who lost relatives on October 7 as well as family members of hostages, such as Thomas Hand, the father of a nine-year-old, Emily, who spent some eight weeks in Hamas captivity before being freed among dozens of women and children in the only hostage deal to date, last November. 'I had to be composed with him during the broadcast,' she told Ynet in an interview published Saturday. 'It's not an Israeli audience that identifies with this terrible story. My job is to use the force of the story to convince my audience. They can hit me with thousands of horrific stories on the Palestinian side, but I know that my audience is also shocked by [these] stories.' What comes across in the interview is that Bouzo feels a sense of mission. 'There are hundreds of TV channels in the Arab world, none of which present the Israeli side. There’s no mention of the hostages or their families,' she noted. The story that most affected her, she said, was that of the kidnapping of Shiri and Yarden Bibas and their four-year-old Ariel and nine-month old, Kfir, the youngest hostages still in captivity. It is not known if any of them are still alive, and Bouzo said she 'cried through the whole interview' with their cousin, Yifat Ziller. 'I thought of my own two children, Gino (11) and Talia (8),' she said. 'I told my husband Hans that I couldn’t imagine how I’d keep it together if a disaster as horrific as that ever happened to us.' She has received venomous messages in reaction to such podcasts, she said, but feels relatively safe in the U.S., while saying, 'I live under the illusion that they don’t know exactly where I live or where my studio is.' She knows she would have been dead 'long ago' had she stayed in her home country. She and her family fled in 2012 after they received death threats following a Facebook post she wrote about a 'horrific massacre' the regime carried out towards the beginning of the civil war in Syria, which 'started off with arresting children and carried on to chopping off hands and feet during interrogations,' she said. In terms of Israel’s ongoing war, she expressed great satisfaction with how the Israelis have decimated Hezbollah, considering the amount of 'blood on their hands' they have of citizens not only of Israel but also Lebanon and her own country as well, she said. 'I’m glad that you’re setting Lebanon ablaze to get rid of Hezbollah,' she said. She believes the fight against Hamas is also just, framing it as a battle against terrorism that has affected Palestinians in Gaza no less than Jews in Israel. 'Assassinating a creature as evil as [Hamas head Yahya] Sinwar is an important step toward freeing the world of the threat of terrorism,' she said. 'His bloody regime has caused the deaths of so many Israelis, and he’s also killed Palestinians - innocent people. 'His assassination conveys a message to anyone seeking to disseminate terror,' she continued. 'The regime in Tehran is shaking in its boots and any terrorist organization is feeling the pressure right now. Sinwar’s assassination is a victory for justice and brings the world one step closer to a safer and freer world.' Bouzo also believes that most Palestinians want peace with Israel but that 'the initiative has to come from the Israeli side - talking about peace with the Palestinians and taking steps toward peace – because you’re the strong side.' She is trying to do her part on her show, she said in her March interview. 'By bringing attention to shared histories and modern realities, Yalla fosters empathy and dialogue, striving for a future where humanization and mutual respect prevail between Israel and its Arab neighbors and amongst Jewish and Muslim communities worldwide,' she said.

Iran taps replacement for ailing Ayatollah Khamenei – report	Tehran's top clerics reportedly choose a new supreme leader to replace the ailing Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who may be supplanted even before his death. By World Israel News Staff Tehran's top Islamic clerics are preparing to replace Iran's octogenarian supreme leader, according to a report published over the weekend. The report was released by Iran International, a Britain-based, Saudi-backed dissident Farsi satellite television network, and claims that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the 85-year-old supreme leader of the Islamic republic who has ruled since 1989, is suffering from a medical condition which is increasingly impairing his ability to lead the country. As such, the 60-member Assembly of Experts, a council of Tehran's top state Shi'ite clerics, met on September 26th at the behest of Khamenei to select his successor, the report claimed. After extensive debate and arduous deliberations, the Assembly of Experts ultimately voted unanimously to designate Khamenei's son, 55-year-old Mojtaba Khamenei, as the country's next spiritual leader. A theology instructor for the Qom Seminary - Iran's largest hawza, or theological school - Mojtaba is considered to be a hardline Islamist radical. Motjaba backed then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and is believed to have a strong influence on his father's politics. According to the report, Mojtaba may succeed his father even prior to his death, given Khamenei's reportedly deteriorating physical condition and diminishing capabilities. Khamenei himself has reportedly groom Mojtaba to replace him during his own lifetime, and is said to be considering stepping down to pave the way for the transition of power. Last week, Iran International reported that a major political scandal in Iran - centered around revelations of high-level corruption involving dozens of senior officials - was part of a larger effort orchestrated by Mojtaba and his allies to weaken potential rivals and secure his bid to succeed his father. Former lawmaker Abbas Palizdar, who gave a nearly three-hour interview on a massive, 54,000-page document regarding a string of corruption probes, used the scandal as an opportunity to endorse Mojtaba, saying his leadership would bring Iran to the kinds of 'fundamental reforms' the country's political echelon needs.

Latin American leaders back Israel in conflict against Iran, Hama...	Leaders from 19 Latin American countries sign declaration backing Israel's right to self-defense against Iran and its terrorist proxies including Hamas and Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff At the Combat Antisemitism Movement’s (CAM) fourth annual 2024 Latin American Forum Against Antisemitism, leaders from 19 Latin American countries signed a joint declaration affirming solidarity with the State of Israel and firmly backing its right to self-defense against the Iranian regime and its regional terrorist proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. The declaration further demanded that 'the Iranian regime be held accountable for its global terrorist activities, both past and present.' The four-day forum, held from November 11-14 in San José, Costa Rica, in partnership with the World Zionist Organization (WZO), convened high-profile government officials, diplomats, and regional leaders from across the Americas to establish a unified regional response to threats against Israel and antisemitism through collaborative action and a comprehensive joint declaration. 'The forum sent a resounding message of regional solidarity and allyship with the Jewish people and State of Israel during a time of unprecedented levels of antisemitism worldwide and rising threats from the Tehran regime and its terrorist proxies, including in Latin America, where Jewish communities have already been victimized by Iranian aggression in the past,' said CEO of the CAM Sacha Roytman Dratwa. 'No region of the world is immune to the proliferation of antisemitism, and CAM’s regional strategy, with offices across North and South America, as well as Europe and the Middle East, enables us to identify and respond to manifestations of antisemitism wherever they appear and offer locally tailored solutions.' Following last year's gathering in Uruguay, this year's forum, drawing participants from 19 countries, featured groundbreaking discussions on pressing challenges facing Jewish communities throughout Latin America, including the rise of global antisemitism following the October 7th attack on Israel and the growing threat of Iran and its terrorist proxies. The joint declaration, signed by participating nations and organizations, establishes concrete commitments to combat antisemitism across Latin America. It calls for implementing zero-hate policies, adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition of Antisemitism, developing educational initiatives, and demanding accountability for terrorist activities in the region, including the 1994 AMIA Jewish community center bombing in Buenos Aires. 'This forum represents a crucial step forward in uniting Latin American nations against rising antisemitism,' said Shay Salamon, Director of Hispanic Affairs of CAM. 'The breadth of participation and depth of commitment demonstrated here shows that Latin America stands ready to act together against hatred and discrimination.' 'Latin America has a crucial role to play in the global fight against antisemitism,' said Aaron Keyak, U.S. Deputy Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. 'The strong participation and concrete commitments made at this forum demonstrate that regional leaders understand the urgency of this moment and are ready to take meaningful action to protect their Jewish communities and combat hatred in all its forms.' Among the forum's most notable moments was the presentation of new research findings on antisemitism in Latin America since October 7th, alongside a moving Kristallnacht commemoration ceremony. The gathering also featured expert panels examining the evolution of antisemitism from the Holocaust to contemporary challenges, as well as strategic discussions on implementing practical measures to combat antisemitism across the region. The speakers included Aaron Keyak, U.S. Deputy Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism; Michal Gur-Aryeh, Ambassador of Israel to Costa Rica; and renowned Catalan journalist and Chair of the CAM Advisory Board for Latin America Pilar Rahola. The gathering received support from Costa Rica’s national leadership, including Vice President Stephan Brunner, Minister of Foreign Trade Manuel Tovar, Minister of Culture Jorge Rodriguez Vives, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Lydia Maria Peralta Cordero, demonstrating strong host country commitment to CAM's initiatives. The forum also welcomed the attendance of key regional figures including Judge Nancy Hernandez, President of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and Fernando Lottenberg, Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism of the Organization of American States (OAS). Forum participants met at Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly with 15 Latin American lawmakers who presented initiatives they were promoting to combat antisemitism and hate speech. The forum concluded with participating nations and organizations pledging to strengthen cooperation in fighting antisemitism and promoting education about Jewish history and culture throughout Latin America.

3 arrested for firing flares, sparking fire at Netanyahu’s home	Senior military officer in the reserves is among those expected to face charges for arson, explosive use. By World Israel News Staff Three anti-government protesters were arrested after they fired multiple flares at the private home of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Caesarea on Saturday evening. One of those arrested is a senior military officer in the reserves, according to Hebrew-language media reports. In a statement, the Shin Bet internal security agency identified the officer as a prominent 'leader' of the weekly protests in front of Netanyahu's residence. Security footage from the scene showed one of the flares crashing to the ground on Netanyahu's property, sparking a fire. The Netanyahu family was not home at the time of the incident, and no one was injured. The three suspects are expected to expect criminal charges including arson with the intent to harm, intentional damage with explosive material, and illegal release of explosive material. בלעדי: אירוע הזיקוק בקיסריה סמוך לבית ראש הממשלה. בתיעוד הזה שמתפרסם כאן לראשונה ניתן לראות שני זיקוקים ימיים שנורו לשמים בשעה שבע וחצי בערב מאיזור הדיונה היכן שמתקיימות ההפגנות מול בית ראש הממשלה בקיסריה. הדיונה חסומה בגדר ומרוחקת מהבית ומהרחוב שנמצא בצד השני. כפי שרואים בסרטון… pic.twitter.com/OTtU0P6B7h &mdash; בר שם-אור Bar Shem-Ur (@Bar_ShemUr) November 16, 2024 Attorney Gonen Ben Itzhak, who has long been a leader in the anti-government movement, claimed that the severity of the incident was exaggerated and that those arrested are political prisoners. 'This is a minor incident that is being overblown,' Ben Itzhak said on his X account. He then claimed that the arrests were part of a 'witch hunt' targeting those who had only 'fired flares in the air.' Notably, Ben Itzhak did not acknowledge that the flares had started a blaze on Netanyahu's property, nor did he state that firing flares at the premier's home was wrong. 'Good morning to the Bibi-stan dictatorship,' he added, using the prime minister's nickname. An organization advocating for anti-government protesters who are arrested decried the Shin Bet's involvement in the investigation into the incident. 'No one should be surprised that the current regime is dragging prominent protest activists to Shin Bet investigations,' the Arrestee's Support Network said in a statement. 'This is a protest event in which normal pyrotechnics were used and the claims that the Prime Minister's house or anyone from the Prime Minister's surroundings were some kind of target are a crazy and ugly blood libel,' the organization claimed. According to Hebrew-language reports, it's believed that the flares were fired from sand dunes on the beach behind Netanyahu's house - rather than from the protest in front of the home.

Iran, Hezbollah strongholds make Syria a ‘hunting ground’ for Isr...	Syria’s current status as a geographical description rather than a country looks set to remain for the foreseeable future. By Jonathan Spyer, Middle East Forum With Israeli forces in daily action in Gaza and south Lebanon, and intermittent drone and missile attacks continuing from Iraq and Yemen, one front in the regional conflict currently underway has tended to be ignored: Syria. Yet the available evidence shows that Israeli strikes against Lebanese Hezbollah and Iranian targets in Syria have increased significantly over the last two months. The individuals targeted in Syria have included veteran and prominent leaders and operatives of the Iran-led regional axis. At the same time, reports in regional media have appeared in recent weeks portraying Syrian President Bashar Assad as a weak link in the Iranian-led war effort. These reports suggest that the Syrian leader is trying to distance himself from his Iranian ally and move closer to moderate Arab states. Some Israeli Syria-watchers concur with this assessment. So what is going on in Israel’s most significant northern neighbor, and where may things be headed? It is important to remember that the civil war that began in Syria in 2012 has not concluded. Rather, the fighting lines have become frozen, leading to a de facto partition of the country. After a sorting-out period, Syria has since 2019 been divided into three de facto entities: the regime-controlled area, encompassing around 60% of the country’s territory including Damascus and the entire coastal area; the area controlled by the Kurdish-dominated Autonomous Administration of North-East Syria (AANES), which comprises around 30% of Syria; and a Turkish-guaranteed Sunni Islamist enclave in the northwest, holding 10% of the country’s territory. The continuation of this arrangement depends on the willingness of international players to underwrite these areas of control: regime Syria is today a protectorate of Iran and Russia, the US guarantees the survival of the Kurdish-dominated area, and Turkey is the sponsor and controller of the Sunni Islamist area. Assad does not enjoy undisputed territorial control even over the area nominally under his rule. His army is weak and impoverished. As a result, the patrons are today the senior partners. In practice, this means that the Iranians and their militia proxies are today in control of the southeastern border crossing between Iraq and Syria at Albukamal, and the roads leading westward. Assad’s army enters this area only with Iranian permission. Southern Syria is thus a link in the chain of contiguous Iranian control stretching from Iran across Iraq and Syria to Lebanon and the Mediterranean. Israel professes no particular interest in Assad either way, except insofar as his forces seek to facilitate, assist, or defend the Iranian weapons trail from Iraq to Hezbollah-controlled Lebanon. Israel’s interest Israel has, however, an intense interest in Iran’s activities on Syrian soil, and in disrupting the Iranian effort. In recent weeks, this interest has been reflected in some very major 'Resistance Axis' scalps apparently claimed by Israeli air power on Syrian soil. The names on this list may not quite have the prominence of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah or Hamas’s Ismail Haniyeh. But they are significant players, whose sudden absence will contribute significantly to the disarray currently apparent in this regional camp. The list includes Ali Musa Daqduq, a veteran Lebanese Hezbollah operator whose name is well-known to Americans who served in Iraq. In the years of Shi’ite insurgency against US and allied forces in that country, Daqduq was a key facilitator and point man for the Iranians. He is believed by the US to have taken part in deadly attacks on US troops. According to Syrian media reports, Daqduq was killed in an Israeli airstrike on the Sayida Zeinab neighborhood of Damascus on November 12. An Israeli airstrike in the Qusayr area this week took out a second very senior Lebanese Hezbollah operator. Qusayr, in the Syria-Lebanon border area, is a strategically important area for Iran’s arms trail into Lebanon. It was the site of a fierce battle in the Syrian civil war in which Hezbollah prevailed over the Syrian rebels. This week, an Israeli air strike on a location in that area killed Salim Ayyash, the Hezbollah man convicted in absentia for the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al Hariri in 2005. Several additional notable movement figures have also been eliminated in Syria in recent weeks: Mahmoud Shahin, who headed Hezbollah’s intelligence network in Syria and was involved in its air defense efforts, was assassinated on November 4. Abu Saleh, who headed Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, responsible for overseeing the financing of Hezbollah from Iranian oil sales, was killed in a precision strike on October 22 in Damascus. Adham Jahut, a Hezbollah official based in the Quneitra area and responsible for the organization’s intelligence activities in this important location, was killed by an Israeli air strike on October 10. Hassan Jaafar Qassir, brother-in-law of deceased Hezbollah leader Nasrallah, was killed in Damascus on October 3. The disarray of Hezbollah This list reflects both the extent of Israeli intelligence penetration of Syria and Hezbollah, and the extent to which Israel has, since the outbreak of war a year ago, brushed aside former tacit rules of engagement, treating Syria as an inseparable component of an alliance with which Jerusalem is now at war. The recent assassinations also show the relative disarray of Hezbollah and its allies in the face of Israel’s relentless attentions. This jibes with reports from other sources, according to which Hezbollah officials and their families have arrived in Iraq in considerable numbers in recent weeks. There, they are being housed, with the assistance of their comrades in the Iraqi Shi’ite militias, in the Shi’ite holy cities of Najaf and Karbala. Only there, it appears, do they feel safe from Israel. Some observers have suggested that the current relative disarray of the 'Resistance Axis' is leading to efforts by the Syrian leader to extricate himself from it. An article in the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed newspaper this week assembled the evidence. It noted a recent reduction in Captagon smuggling into Jordan, in line with Jordanian and Emirati requests. Also, Saudi Arabia’s decision to reopen its Damascus embassy reflects an undoubted desire among pro-Western Gulf states to draw a line under the civil war and use economic inducements to tempt Assad away from his allies. Behind-the-scenes efforts, led by the Italians, are underway to restore relations between the regime and Europe. But any hopes that Assad might make a decisive break with Iran should probably be resisted. The Syrian dictator remains in debt to Tehran for his surviving the civil war. He must surely be acutely aware that had he met the Arab Spring while aligned with the West, he would almost certainly have shared the fate of fellow authoritarian leaders Zine el Abidine Bin-Ali of Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Also, the current Syrian regime has survived for half a century because it exploited conflict with Israel and the West (while leaving the door slightly open for some future rapprochement). Gulf and Western overtures enable Syria to continue to act according to this pattern. A wholesale abandonment of the Iranians would represent a severe break with a model that has served the Assad family rather well. So any such break remains unlikely. Syria’s current status as a geographical description rather than a country looks set to remain for the foreseeable future. This means that it is likely also to continue to be a hunting ground for Israeli air power working its way down the long list of Hezbollah and Iranian targets in the country.

New ICC judge’s past raises red flags in ‘war crimes’ case agains...	This request may further delay the panel’s decision on whether to indict Netanyahu and Gallant for their alleged 'criminal responsibility for…war crimes and crimes against humanity.' By Jewish Breaking News Israel is questioning the impartiality of one of the three judges probing whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant should be arrested for war crimes by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Slovenian judge Beti Hohler was appointed three weeks ago following the resignation of the presiding judge, Romanian justice Iulia Motoc, for health reasons. According to Reuters, a statement was sent to the court by Israel’s Attorney General’s office asking for Hohler to 'provide information to clarify whether there are (or are not) grounds to reasonably doubt her impartiality,' considering that her previous position had been to serve as an attorney in the ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor (OTP). 'Israel does not suggest that judge Hohler’s previous employment with the OTP necessarily or automatically gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of a lack of impartiality,' the statement said. 'However, judges of this Court have acknowledged that previous duties within the OTP may, depending on the circumstances, give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.' This request may further delay the panel’s decision on whether to indict Netanyahu and Gallant for their alleged 'criminal responsibility for…war crimes and crimes against humanity' in the Gaza Strip during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The request for an arrest warrant, made in May by ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, also included three Hamas heads for their leading roles in the invasion of Israel last October 7, in which Hamas-led terrorists massacred 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, 97 of whom, both dead and alive, are still in captivity. Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh and Mohammed Deif have since been killed by Israel, although Haniyeh’s death in Tehran was not officially acknowledged as an Israeli hit job. Israel, along with several of its allies and legal organizations, had previously submitted official challenges to the warrant. These outlined the ICC’s 'manifest lack of jurisdiction' in the case and charged that the court was violating its own statutes by 'failing to provide Israel with the opportunity to exercise its right to investigate by itself the claims raised by the Prosecutor, before proceeding,' the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in its accompanying statement in September. 'No other democracy with an independent and respected legal system like that which exists in Israel has been treated in this prejudicial manner by the Prosecutor,' the Ministry added. Khan, who had asked that the judges make a quick decision when presenting the arrest request, has since become the subject of an external investigation due to complaints by a former underling that he had made many improper and unwanted sexual advances to her while she worked in his office.

FBI arrests ISIS supporter plotting Houston terrorist attack	A search of Said's personal devices revealed pro-ISIS images and messages, including communication with the official media outlet for ISIS. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon The FBI arrested Houston resident Anas Said for planning a terror attack on U.S. soil and supporting ISIS terrorists, officials announced on Thursday. The 28-year-old, who was taken into federal custody last week, admitted to providing material support to ISIS, investigating how to execute an attack on local military recruiting centers, and boasting that he would commit a '9/11-style' attack if he had the necessary resources. He also admitted to creating ISIS propaganda and offering his home as a refuge to ISIS members. Said was coordinating the foiled attack from his far west Houston apartment, according to the FBI. A search of Said's personal devices revealed pro-ISIS images and messages, including communication with the official media outlet for ISIS. Said has been charged with creating at least five videos and two images that were sent to an ISIS social media and web designer for publication. 'Today is a great day. We’ve taken a suspected terrorist off the streets of Houston,' Douglas Williams, special agent in charge of FBI Houston, said of the arrest in a Thursday morning news conference.

Waves of Israeli airstrikes pound Beirut’s Dahieh district for se...	According to the army, there were three waves of strikes on Saturday — and seven since Friday morning. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli Air Force struck 20 Hezbollah targets in Beirut’s Dahieh district in waves of attacks, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Saturday evening. 'All of the targets attacked were deliberately placed by Hezbollah in the heart of the civilian population. This is another example of the Hezbollah terrorist organization’s cynical use of Lebanese citizens as human shields,' the IDF said. According to the army, there were three waves of strikes on Saturday — and seven since Friday morning. The IDF said residents were warned to leave the area ahead of time and precise munitions were used to mitigate civilian damage. Also on Saturday, Hezbollah launched at least 65 rockets and drones at Israel. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014. בפעם השלישית היום והשביעית מאתמול בבוקר: צה״ל השלים גל תקיפות על מפקדות חיזבאללה בדאחייה. בהכוונת אגף המודיעין, מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר השלימו לפני זמן קצר גל תקיפות נוסף על מפקדות צבאיות של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה במרחב הדאחייה שבביירות >> pic.twitter.com/9Y3U645ceB — צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 16, 2024 The post Waves of Israeli airstrikes pound Beirut’s Dahieh district for second day appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/waves-of-israeli-airstrikes-pound-beiruts-dahieh-district-for-second-day/	2024-11-16T17:04:56-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IAF-fighter-jets.jpg
USAID announces $230 million in Palestinian aid, adding to $190 m...	USAID states the new funding will 'support economic recovery and development programs in the West Bank and Gaza.' By JNS The U.S. Agency for International Development, an independent federal agency, announced last week that it is giving another $230 million in aid to the Palestinian people, after having said over the summer that it was giving $190 million to the Palestinians. JNS sought comment from USAID, which first posted the news last week but dated the release Nov. 17. USAID initially indicated that it would return a call from JNS on Friday but did not do so. It now dates its release Nov. 15. 'A significant chunk of this money, indirectly if not directly, funds Hamas,' wrote Michael Doran, a senior fellow and director of the Hudson Institute’s Center for Peace and Security in the Middle East. USAID states that the new funding will 'support economic recovery and development programs in the West Bank and Gaza.' (The Biden administration and some others refer to Judea and Samaria as the 'West Bank.') 'This significant investment highlights USAID’s commitment to improving the lives of individuals and communities in the region amidst challenging conditions,' the agency stated. It noted that it has 'invested' more than $600 million 'in economic support funding of the Palestinian people, in addition to the over $2.1 billion in humanitarian assistance since Oct. 7, 2023.' 'Our commitment to the Palestinian people remains steadfast,' stated Amy Tohill-Stull, the West Bank and Gaza mission director at USAID. 'This funding demonstrates our resolve to support sustainable development and provide essential services that enhance the quality of life for all Palestinians and further reduce the influence of Hamas.' The funding 'aims to promote resilience among Palestinian communities, and will support a range of programmatic areas, including private sector and civil society strengthening, youth empowerment and education and community level priorities,' USAID said. 'New initiatives focus on health recovery efforts in Gaza, trade and investment, improvements in water and wastewater access and management, construction of new youth centers and safe spaces, capacity building support for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network and strengthening of municipalities to deliver more effective, accountable governance.' It added that it 'reaffirms its long-standing partnership with the Palestinian people and its dedication to providing essential support during these trying times' and 'remains committed to a peaceful and prosperous future for all in the region.'

Saudi Arabia’s anti-Israel rhetoric and Iran rapprochement raises...	Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler accused the Israeli military of committing collective genocide in Gaza. By Debbie Weiss, The Algemeiner Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler accused the Israeli military of committing 'collective genocide' in Gaza while also pressing Israel to respect Iranian sovereignty, amid reports that Tehran has postponed its planned attack on the Jewish state. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s remarks, made in Riyadh on Monday during a summit of leaders of Islamic nations, underscored the evolving rapprochement between the erstwhile archenemies Iran and Saudi Arabia. The crown prince, also known by his initials MBS, urged the international community to demand that Israel 'respect the sovereignty of the sisterly Islamic Republic of Iran and not to violate its lands.' The two regional heavyweights restored relations last year after decades of animosity. MBS’s anti-Israel rhetoric came days after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. For Israel, the statement from Riyadh may signal a setback to the normalization process with Saudi Arabia, a long-sought goal within the framework of the Abraham Accords, brokered by Trump during his first term in the White House, that has seen Israel establish formal ties with several Arab states in recent years. According to a Sky News Arabia report published two days later and citing Iranian officials, Tehran has shelved a planned third direct strike on Israel, with the delay attributed to possible forthcoming diplomatic talks with Trump. Israel Hayom published a similar report the following day, citing officials in Jerusalem familiar with the matter. Iranian First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref expressed his hope that the incoming Trump administration would put a stop to Israel’s campaigns against its terrorist proxies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'The American government is the main supporter of the actions of the Zionist regime [Israel], and the world is waiting for the promise of the new government of this country to immediately stop the war against the innocent people of Gaza and Lebanon,' Aref said at Monday’s gathering. Observers noted that Saudi Arabia’s shift could stem from both domestic and regional considerations. For the kingdom, improving relations with Iran is a strategic move to de-escalate conflicts in Yemen, where both countries have backed opposing sides. By opening diplomatic channels with Iran, Saudi Arabia also aims to reduce its dependence on Western security guarantees amid growing regional autonomy. According to Dr. Eyal Pinko, a Middle East expert who served in Israeli intelligence for more than three decades, Saudi Arabia is also under pressure from France, a major arms supplier, to maintain a moderate stance and promote regional peace. 'Saudi Arabia understands [it] cannot rely on the Americans' for arms, Pinko told The Algemeiner. For its part, Iran may be seeking closer ties with the Gulf kingdom as a result of recent Israeli operations that have decimated the senior leadership of Hezbollah, Iran’s most influential proxy in the Arab world that has long served as a strategic partner. 'Iran is spreading its bets all around, not to be on one side or another,' Pinko said. Hezbollah, along with Hamas in Gaza, had in the past been blacklisted as terrorist groups by Riyadh. The New York Times last month cited a Saudi tycoon with ties to the monarchy as saying that the war in Gaza has 'set back any Israeli integration into the region.' 'Saudi Arabia sees that any association with Israel has become more toxic since Gaza,' Ali Shihabi told the newspaper. In another blow for Saudi-Israel relations, Riyadh announced it would revoke the license of the Saudi news broadcaster, MBC, after it labeled the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar a terrorist. But according to Pinko, the chance of Saudi-Israel normalization is not entirely lost, pending a ceasefire. 'If nothing extreme happens with Iran until Jan. 20 [when Trump takes office], I believe that the Abraham Accords will come back to the table,' he said.

Israel eliminated secret Iran nuclear site	The clandestine site held sophisticated equipment used for testing explosives needed to detonate nuclear devices. By JNS The Israeli airstrikes on Iran last month destroyed a secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin, 19 miles southeast of Tehran, Axios reported on Friday. The clandestine site held sophisticated equipment used for testing explosives needed to detonate nuclear devices, the report read, citing three U.S. officials, one current Israeli official and one former Israeli official. The Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security acquired high-resolution satellite imagery of the facility, which showed that it was completely destroyed in Israel’s Oct. 26 attack. Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies began noticing activity in the Taleghan 2 facility in the Parchin military complex in early 2024, which had been largely inactive since 2003, when the Islamic Republic froze its military nuclear program, according to Axios. One unnamed U.S. official quoted in the report said: '[The Iranians] conducted scientific activity that could lay the ground for the production of a nuclear weapon. It was a top secret thing. A small part of the Iranian government knew about this, but most of the Iranian government didn’t.' Although President Joe Biden asked Jerusalem not to target Tehran’s nuclear facilities, the site in Parchin was chosen as a target because it was not part of Iran’s declared nuclear program. This placed the mullah regime in a position where admitting a hit to the site would expose its efforts to resume activity forbidden by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Moreover, 'The strike was a not so subtle message that the Israelis have significant insight into the Iranian system even when it comes to things that were kept top secret and known to a very small group of people in the Iranian government,' the report cited a U.S. official as saying. Last week, Rafael Grossi, the director of the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency, visited Iran for the first time since May. He is expected to meet with his agency’s board of governors in Vienna this week for a vote on a resolution to censure Tehran for its lack of cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. Speaking about the tensions between Israel and Iran, Grossi said during a news conference in Tehran on Thursday that the Islamic Republic’s 'nuclear installations should not be attacked.' Earlier in the week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz suggested that Iran’s nuclear facilities may be targeted. Iran is 'more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities. We have the opportunity to achieve our most important goal—to thwart and eliminate the existential threat to the State of Israel,' Katz said. Israel’s two assaults against Iran’s air defense system this year have left the country vulnerable to future attacks, with all four of Tehran’s Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile batteries destroyed, according to U.S. media. On April 19, Israel took out one of the S-300 systems in response to Tehran’s first-ever direct attack against the Jewish state. On Oct. 26, in response to a second Iranian attack, Israel targeted 20 sites in Iran, destroying the remaining three. 'The majority of Iran’s air defense was taken out,' a senior Israeli official told Fox News.

Israel’s National Library unveils rare photos of WWII Jewish hero...	The images displayed capture candid moments, such as Senesh on horseback at Kfar Baruch, playing table tennis, and working with cows at the Nahalal Agricultural School. By Jewish Breaking News The National Library of Israel has unveiled an extensive collection of photographs chronicling the life of a Jewish war heroine. Born in Budapest in 1921, Hannah Senesh received an Agfa Box-Spezial Camera at a young age, which became her constant companion. Her photographs span from her early life in Budapest through family vacations, and later document her pioneering days in British Mandatory Palestine. Senesh’s life took a dramatic turn in 1943 when she enlisted in the British army and volunteered for a dangerous paratrooper mission into Nazi-occupied Europe. She was tasked to assist downed Allied pilots in escaping and to aid Jewish communities under Nazi occupation. In March 1944, she parachuted into Slovenia with three fellow paratroopers. Tragically, on June 9, 1944, Hungarian police captured her in Budapest. Despite enduring months of torture and the arrest of her mother, Senesh refused to divulge information to her captors. She was ultimately charged with spying and treason, leading to her execution on November 7, 1944, at just 23 years old. In 1945, Jewish Brigade soldier Moshe Braslavsky discovered a suitcase under her bed at Kibbutz Sdot Yam containing letters, diaries, and photo albums. Later, a notebook of poetry, entrusted to a friend before her final mission, emerged to further cement her cultural impact. In recognition of her sacrifice, Senesh was reinterred in 1950 at Israel’s national military cemetery on Mt. Herzl in Jerusalem. The archive contains a treasure trove of her personal effects, including manuscripts, notebooks, photographs, documents, and personal items. In her own words, preserved in letters to her mother, Senesh humorously noted, 'Everyone wants me to photograph them, as if they’ve appointed me the court photographer.' Her photographic legacy includes carefully curated albums with typewritten captions and personal annotations on the backs of photos, many of which were sent to her family in Hungary. The images displayed capture candid moments, such as Senesh on horseback at Kfar Baruch, playing table tennis, and working with cows at the Nahalal Agricultural School.

Trump taps RFK Jr. to lead Dept. of Health and Human Services	Shortly before the election, Trump had assured him that, if elected, he would let the longtime vaccine skeptic 'go wild on health.' By Andrew Lapin, JTA Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the anti-vaccine questioner and onetime presidential candidate, is President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump announced his pick for the Cabinet position on Truth Social, his social network, on Thursday afternoon, saying he was 'thrilled' to nominate Kennedy to lead the department. 'For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,' Trump wrote. 'Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!' The nomination cemented the unlikely alliance between Trump and the scion of Democratic Party royalty, who suspended his third-party campaign to endorse the Republican this summer. Shortly before the election, Trump had assured him that, if elected, he would let the longtime vaccine skeptic 'go wild on health.' In addition to his anti-vaccine views, Kennedy has also floated removing fluoride from drinking water. Among the areas that would be under Kennedy’s purview at the department: the Food and Drug Administration; Medicare and Medicaid; the National Institutes of Health; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; agencies dealing with substance abuse, mental health and toxic substances; and the office of U.S. Surgeon General. He is ardently pro-Israel and recently defended Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the late leader of the Chabad Hasidic movement, from attacks leveled by far-right commentator Candace Owens. Some prominent Jews have declared themselves in Kennedy’s corner. After Thursday’s nomination announcement, he gained another one: Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado. 'I’m excited by the news that the President-Elect will appoint Robert Kennedy Jr.,' Polis wrote on social media, saying Kennedy had 'helped us defeat vaccine mandates in Colorado in 2019.' Polis outlined several health-related policy positions he said he agreed with Kennedy on, including reforming federal nutrition standards, curbing pesticide usage and capping international drug prices. Polis concluded, 'He will face strong special interest opposition on these, but I look forward to partnering with him to truly make American healthy again and I hope that we can finally make progress on these important issues.'

Iran and Qatar have their fingerprints all over South Africa’s an...	Rumors about Iranian involvement in the ICJ case have been swirling for some time in South Africa. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Iran, Qatar, Hamas, and other terrorist entities are quietly underwriting South Africa's effort to prosecute Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a new report obtained by the Washington Free Beacon alleges. South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), brought its case against Israel on Dec. 29, 2023, just three months after Hamas's terror spree left more than 1,200 dead and hundreds more kidnapped. The suit alleges that Israel is committing mass genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip but offers little evidence to support this claim. Nevertheless, more than a dozen countries have joined the suit over the last year, elevating international pressure on Israel as the Jewish state fights to survive. The timing of the lawsuit is raising fresh questions about South Africa's motivation for bringing it, prompting an in-depth investigation by the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP), a nonprofit that studies global Jew-hatred. The report 'connects South Africa's political and financial alignment with Iran and Qatar—both leading supporters of global terrorism—with its campaign to bring a legal case against Israel,' ISGAP said in a draft press release. The African National Congress, ISGAP found, was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy before it received a mysterious cash infusion in early 2024—just days after it launched the ICJ case against Israel. The source of this cash, the report states, is believed to be Iran and its regional allies, including Qatar, which are using South Africa to launder baseless claims against Israel and ratchet up diplomatic pressure amid a brutal yearlong war. 'Crucially, this money appeared in the ANC's coffers without explanation, mere days after the South African government brought its case against Israel at the ICJ,' according to ISGAP's report. 'Given the lack of merit in South Africa's case, and the unlikely possibility that it was brought unilaterally by an unpopular and near-bankrupt ANC, a crucial question arises. Who is actually funding South Africa's case at the ICJ?' African National Congress leaders, including South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, have declined to disclose the source of this funding, which helped the party recover from nearly $30 million in debt. Putting a case before the ICJ requires deep pockets. Estimates place the preliminary costs at around $10.5 million, with a trial running as high as $79 million. 'Given the enormity of the cost, it is difficult to dismiss the argument that South Africa was the beneficiary of considerable external support,' according to ISGAP's report. In March, the Electoral Commission of South Africa opened an investigation into how the ANC settled its soaring debt. Rumors about Iranian involvement in the ICJ case have been swirling for some time in South Africa. Frans Cronje, a former CEO of the South African Institute of Race Relations, alleged in a January interview that Tehran enlisted its allies in the ANC to bring the lawsuit. 'The South Africans,' Cronje said, 'have for an extended period of time been fronting an Iranian strategy to do two things: The first is to so poison opinion against Israel in the Western world that military aid to Israel becomes increasingly conditional and, secondly, to so traumatize and stigmatize young Jews around the world that service in the [Israel Defense Forces] becomes increasingly controversial.' Evidence of Iran's role in the ICJ case is shown through the legal advisory team leading South Africa's lawsuit, which includes those 'affiliated with internationally recognized terrorist entities.' A network of pro-Palestinian activist groups sculpted the legal groundwork underpinning South Africa's suit, according to ISGAP's research. Those groups include Law for Palestine, a research organization that has worked alongside the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), and the U.S.-based Democracy for the Arab World Now, which has lobbied the American government to cut off arms shipments to Israel. 'This effective network of legal experts who are united in their attempts to delegitimize Israel in international legal forums played a key role in the submission of South Africa's ICJ case against Israel,' according to the report. One member of the South African legal team, Shawan Jabarin, also serves as the general director of Al-Haq, a Palestinian advocacy group that helps push economic boycotts on Israel as part of the global BDS movement. Jabarin is also reportedly linked to the PFLP terror group. Another member of the South African delegation, Raji Sourani, also maintains ties to the PFLP. He is the founder of the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, another group that wages lawfare against Israel. Sourani served a three-year prison sentence in Israel for being a PFLP member and was denied a U.S. entry visa in 2012. Two years later, Sourani attended a PFLP ceremony and stated, 'I was in the ranks of the Popular Front, and there were comrades who taught us with their own hands. … We don't apologize and don't regret our past, we are proud that once we were members of this organization and we fought in its ranks.' ISGAP found that out of 574 citations in South Africa's ICJ complaint, at least 45 can be traced back to 'overtly anti-Israel NGOs,' including Al-Haq and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights. Against this backdrop, the South African government has drawn closer to Iran and Qatar for years, lending credibility to claims that anti-Israel powers in the Middle East played a central role in the ICJ case. In late July, for instance, South African foreign minister Ronald Lamola traveled to Tehran to participate in the swearing-in ceremony for Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian. Lamole met there with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Bagheri, who praised Lamole's 'outstanding role as an undaunted and innovative diplomat in pursuing the case of the Zionist regime's crimes at the International Court of Justice.' Bagheri added that Iran 'fully supports South Africa's vital role in this regard.' It has become increasingly clear in recent years that Iran views South Africa 'as a hub for circumventing Western sanctions,' according to the report, which notes that Tehran 'has sought to acquire satellite interception, online surveillance, hacking, and missile guidance technologies from South Africa.' The African country also championed Iran's inclusion in the BRICS economic bloc, which has helped it keep access to international cash sources while facing American sanctions. Economic ties between South Africa and Qatar, an Iranian ally that has sheltered Hamas's leadership, have also been growing in recent years. Bilateral trade between South Africa and Qatar rose from around $307 million in 2012 to roughly $1 billion in 2022. Notably, 'it was Hamas's mediation between South Africa and Qatar that prompted them to strengthen their relations,' according to the report. Charles Asher Small, ISGAP's executive director, said his group's findings 'position South Africa as a key player in the global web of anti-democratic terror financing.' The ICJ case is part of a broader attempt by anti-Israel extremists 'to delegitimize Israel in order to destroy it and to undermine democracy and related institutions.'

Scientists harness electric fields to forecast extreme weather	The data revealed that different cloud types produced distinct electric field patterns, offering new clues about the structure and intensity of storms. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli researchers on Thursday unveiled a groundbreaking approach to predicting severe weather events by monitoring atmospheric electric fields. The ability to track electric field variations in real time could provide meteorologists with valuable early warnings for extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, flash floods, or intense storms, and inform long-term climate adaptation strategies. By studying the Negev Desert in southern Israel, an area known for its unpredictable climate, researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Reichmann University found that as these systems passed through, there were substantial increases in the Potential Gradient of the electric field, rising from typical fair-weather values of 100-200 volts per meter to several thousand volts per meter. The study, led by Dr. Roy Yaniv from the Institute of Earth Sciences at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in collaboration with Prof. Yoav Yair of Reichmann University, was recently published in the peer-reviewed Atmospheric Research journal. The study focused on 'wet' Cyprus Lows — a type of low-pressure weather system commonly associated with rainstorms in the Negev. Sharp spikes in the electric field coincided with the passage of convective clouds, which are often linked to intense rainfall. The data revealed that different cloud types produced distinct electric field patterns, offering new clues about the structure and intensity of storms. Additionally, the study also found that factors such as the electrical charge of rain droplets and cloud structure could significantly impact the electric field, further refining the ability to predict weather patterns. 'This research demonstrates how electric field variations can serve as indicators of shifting weather patterns, allowing us to anticipate severe weather events in real-time,' said Yaniv. 'The ability to identify these changes early is especially crucial in vulnerable regions like Israel, where even minor shifts in climate conditions can lead to major local impacts.' The ability to track electric field variations in real time could provide meteorologists with valuable early warnings for extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, flash floods, or intense storms. This could be especially useful in desert and semi-arid regions where traditional weather forecasting methods are less effective due to rapid changes in weather patterns. As climate change leads to more unpredictable and extreme weather patterns, monitoring electric fields could potentially help governments better understand shifting weather dynamics.

Pro-Hamas groups planting seeds of domestic terrorism in US, new ...	By flooding college campuses with agitprop and staging activities — protests or vandalisms — they hoped to manufacture an army of revolutionaries willing to adopt Hamas’s aims. By Dion J. Pierre, The Algemeiner Domestic terrorism may be the end game for the over 150 pro-Hamas groups operating on colleges campuses and elsewhere across the US to foster anti-Israel demonstrations, according to a new report by the Capital Research Center (CRC) think tank. 'The movement contains militant elements pushing it toward a wider, more severe campaign focused on property destruction and violence properly described as domestic terrorism,' researcher Ryan Mauro wrote in the report, titled 'Marching Toward Violence: The Domestic Anti-Israeli Protest Movement,' which was published last week. 'It demands the ‘dismantlement’ of America’s ‘colonialist,’ ‘imperialist,’ or ‘capitalist,’ system, often calling for the US to be abolished as a country.' He continued, 'These revolutionary goals are held by the two different factions of the anti-Israel extremist groups. The first faction combines Islamists, communists/Marxists, and anarchists. The second faction consists of groups with white supremacist/nationalist ideologies. They share Jew-hatred, anti-Americanism, and the goal of sparking a revolutionary uprising.' The group that is most responsible for the anti-Israel protest movement is Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), according to the report. Drawing on statements issued and actions taken by SJP and their collaborators, Mauro made the case that toolkits published by SJP herald Hamas for perpetrating mass casualties of civilians; SJP has endorsed Iran’s attacks on Israel as well as its stated intention to overturn the US-led world order; and other groups under its umbrella have called on followers to 'Bring the Intifada Home.' Such activities, the report explained, accelerated after Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel last Oct. 7, which pro-Hamas groups perceived as an inflection point in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and an opportunity. By flooding the internet and college campuses with agitprop and staging activities — protests or vandalisms — they hoped to manufacture a critical mass of youth support for their ideas, thus creating an army of revolutionaries willing to adopt Hamas’s aims as their own. The result has been a series of the kinds of incidents seen in academia during fall semester. Last month, when Jews around the world mourned on the anniversary of Oct. 7, a Harvard University student group called on pro-Hamas activists to 'Bring the war home' and proceeded to vandalize a campus administrative building. The group members, who described themselves as 'anonymous,' later said in a statement, 'We are committed to bringing the war home and answering the call to open up a new front here in the belly of the beast.' On the same day, the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee (PSC) issued a similar statement, saying 'now is the time to escalate,' adding, 'Harvard’s insistence on funding slaughter only strengthens our moral imperative and commitment to our demands.' More recently, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) student wrote a journal article which argued that violence is a legitimate method of effecting political change and, moreover, advancing the pro-Palestinian movement. In September, during Columbia University’s convocation ceremony, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), a group which recently split due to racial tensions between Arabs and non-Arabs, distributed a pamphlet which called on students to join Hamas. 'This booklet is part of a coordinated and intentional effort to uphold the principles of the thawabit and the Palestinian resistance movement overall by transmitting the words of the resistance directly,' said the manifesto, distributed by CUAD, an SJP spinoff, to incoming freshmen. 'This material aims to build popular support for the Palestinian war of national liberation, a war which is waged through armed struggle.' Other sections of it were explicitly Islamist, invoking the name of 'Allah, the most gracious' and referring to Hamas as the 'Islamic Resistance Movement.' Proclaiming, 'Glory to Gaza that gave hope to the oppressed, that humiliated the ‘invincible’ Zionist army,' it said its purpose was to build an army of Muslims worldwide. 'Groups in the pro-terrorism, anti-Israel movement co-exist as our concentric circles of increasing malevolence,' Mauro said of the level of support for revolutionary violence on college campuses. 'Groups in the outermost circle avoid risks as they recruit new protest members and seek to integrate as many political causes as possible under the anti-Israel umbrella … Some militants aspire to incorporate the campaign into a broader wear on law enforcement if not an insurgency.' As The Algemeiner has previously reported, pro-Hamas activists have already demonstrated that they are willing to hurt people to achieve their goals. Last year, in California, an elderly Jewish man was killed when an anti-Zionist professor employed by a local community college allegedly pushed him during an argument. At Cornell University in upstate New York, a student threatened to rape and kill Jewish female students and''shoot up' the campus’ Hillel center. Violence, according to a report by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), was most common at universities in the state of California, where anti-Zionist activists punched a Jewish student for filming him at a protest.

IDF officer KIA in Lebanon, bringing military death toll to 794	His father, Col. (res.) Ilan Dickshtein, previously commanded the IDF’s Etzioni Brigade and the Golani Reconnaissance Battalion. By JNS Israel Defense Forces Lt. Ivri Dickshtein, 21, was killed in action battling Hezbollah terrorists in Southern Lebanon, the IDF said on Thursday night. Dickshtein, a resident of Elazar in the Gush Etzion region of Judea, was a platoon commander in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion. A combat officer from the brigade was seriously wounded in the same incident. The Binyamin Regional Council, which administers large parts of southern and central Samaria, said that Dickshtein, who grew up in the community of Eli, is survived by his wife, parents and five siblings. His father, Col. (res.) Ilan Dickshtein, previously commanded the IDF’s Etzioni Brigade and the Golani Reconnaissance Battalion. According to Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster, the family lives on the same street as the parents of Capt. Shilo Rauchberger, who was killed by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, as well as those of Capt. Roy Beit Ya’akov, who died in a 'friendly fire' incident in May. 'We lost Ivri, a combat officer—the best of Binyamin’s sons—who grew up and was educated here, fought like a hero and fell in defense of the people and their land,' council head Israel Ganz said in the statement. 'The community of Eli, along with the other towns in Binyamin, is at the forefront of the war and is paying a painful price for the revival of the Jewish people in their land,' Ganz said. On Wednesday, six IDF soldiers were killed in a firefight with Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon, while a seventh was moderately wounded. All of them served in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion. The Golani soldiers were ambushed at short range by Hezbollah terrorists after entering a structure where the army had not yet operated. An hours-long firefight ensued, which ended with at least one terrorist dead and the area falling under IDF control. The death toll among Israeli troops since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist massacre now stands at 794, according to IDF figures. Additionally, Ch. Insp. Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Afghanistan’s last Jew arrives in Israel	Simantov, who lived in and took care of Kabul’s synagogue, was spirited out of Afghanistan in a rescue operation led by Moti Kahana, an Israeli-American businessman. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS Zebulon Simantov, Afghanistan’s last Jew, who was rescued from Kabul in September 2021, arrived in Israel last week. Simantov initially went to Turkey, spending three years in Istanbul, and would have continued there but was prompted to move to Israel by ill health, the U.K.’s Jewish News reported on Tuesday. Simantov will settle in Ashdod. In Israel, he has an ex-wife, daughters and five siblings. Simantov, who lived in and took care of Kabul’s synagogue, was spirited out of Afghanistan in a rescue operation led by Moti Kahana, an Israeli-American businessman. Simantov drove his rescuers crazy in the process. 'The hardest thing I ever did was dealing with that guy,' Kahana told JNS at the time, adding that he’s dealt with many crazy people in his line of work, but Simantov is 'definitely on the top of the list.' Simantov had lived under the Taliban from 1996 to 2001 and managed to survive, even while carrying on a fight with the only other Jew in the country, Isaac Levy, who passed away in 2005. (It’s been reported that the Taliban once imprisoned them both and then released them because they couldn’t stand the two constantly arguing.) 'You can be a funny character, but we still have to save your life,' Chabad Rabbi Mendy Chitrik, who is based in Istanbul, told JNS at the time. Chitrik is chairman of the Alliance of Rabbis of Islamic States, an organization serving the religious needs of Jewish communities in places such as Indonesia and Casablanca. 'We were in touch with Simantov for about three years, sending him matzah, asking him if he needed anything,' said Chitrik. Chitrik said he knew Simantov was a character, having read about his fight with Levy and seen videos of conversations, but it still came as a surprise when Simantov demanded that he be paid to leave. 'First, he said he had some debts he had to pay. Then he said he wanted money,' said Chitrik. 'We said we’re not in the business of paying people to get out of Afghanistan. We’re in the business of saving people if they want to be saved.' 'He wanted $50,000. Then he wanted $80,000. Then he wanted $150,000,' said Kahana. Then Simontov changed his mind. 'After Kabul was taken over, a few days into it, he was calling me nonstop to come and get him,' added Kahana. 'I said, ‘Zebulon, it’s too late; my guys are doing other stuff. They can’t come back today.’ ' The reason Simantov reversed his decision to leave Afghanistan was twofold. 'It was his fear of ISIS, and it was his neighbors wanting him to take their kids out,' explained Kahana. Simantov’s neighbors had reason to fear as they belonged to an ethnic minority, the Hazaras, which was persecuted when the Taliban first took over Afghanistan in the 1990s, massacring thousands. Once Simantov agreed to go, he insisted on helping his neighbors’ families. 'We had agreed on 18,' said Kahana. 'But when my team showed up at his home, he had with him 100. My guys asked me, ‘You want to take all these people?’ And I said, ‘No way, we don’t have the equipment. We’ll take the 18 we agreed.’ After negotiation, we squeezed in 30 people.' That brought the total to 31 with Simantov. By then, Chitrik and other rabbis had become aware that there was an issue regarding Simantov’s failure to give his wife a get, or religious divorce. According to Jewish law, a husband must present a divorce document to his wife; when a husband refuses to do so, the wife is unable to remarry. It has been 20 years since Simantov’s wife left him with their daughters to Israel. 'We put a condition on our involvement in his rescue that he would give a divorce to his wife,' said Chitrik. Simantov signed the divorce papers.

Bipartisan bill to bar Hamas supporters from U.S. advances to Sen...	It would also make them ineligible for any relief under current immigration statutes. By Jewish Breaking News Two senators from both sides of the aisle introduced legislation on Wednesday to bar Hamas sympathizers from entering the United States. While federal law already bars terrorists from entering the country, the No Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act, introduced by Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) and Sen. Jacky Rosen (D., Nev.), cuts through any ambiguity by barring any 'representatives, officers, members or spokespersons' of Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and anyone found involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel. It would also make them ineligible for any relief under current immigration statutes. 'Since January 2021, the Biden-Harris administration has released nearly 100 dangerous individuals on the terrorist watchlist into the country, as well as illegal immigrants from U.S. adversaries like Iran,' Blackburn said in a statement. 'This common-sense, bipartisan bill would ensure that no migrant tied to Hamas and the horrific terrorist attack on October 7 is allowed to enter our country or receive immigration benefits on the taxpayer dime.' The bill was first introduced in the House last year by Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) and passed there with a 422-2 vote. Unsurprisingly, the two no votes came from anti-Israel 'Squad' members Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who called the bill 'redundant' and biased against Arabs. 'H.R. 6679 is unnecessary because it is redundant with already existing federal law. It’s just another GOP messaging bill being used to incite anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian, and anti-Muslim hatred that makes communities like ours unsafe,' Tlaib said. As it did in the House, the historic motion is likely to pass in the Senate, sending it to either President Joe Biden or President-elect Donald Trump’s desk for approval or veto.

Harris campaign’s multimillion-dollar debt raises tension with DN...	Harris ended her presidential bid with at least a $20 million debt, a source familiar with her campaign confirmed to NewsNation this week. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Democratic National Committee leaders are frustrated over the prospect of facing a multimillion-dollar debt from Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, Axios reported Wednesday. DNC chairman Jaime Harrison privately criticized the Harris campaign’s spending and expressed concerns about the scale of its debt, sources told Axios. While the campaign raised just over $1 billion in contributions, the Harris-Walz ticket and its allies spent nearly $1.4 billion on political ads alone, outspending the Trump-Vance campaign and Republican groups by about $460 million. The debt could hinder the Democratic Party’s efforts to rebuild and prepare for upcoming elections, according to Axios. DNC leaders are worried about a repeat of the aftermath of Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection, which left the committee over $2 million in debt by late 2015—a strain Hillary Clinton’s team believes contributed to her defeat in the 2016 presidential race. It remains unclear exactly how much debt Harris’s team accumulated as the campaign is still receiving bills from vendors, Axios reported. Harris ended her presidential bid with at least a $20 million debt, a source familiar with her campaign confirmed to NewsNation this week. The campaign has sought to make up for the losses by continuing to solicit donations from supporters and selling its email list, according to reports last week. Many Democrats, including Harris staffers, remain perplexed over how President-elect Donald Trump secured such a decisive victory despite the Harris campaign’s massive spending on high-profile rallies and ads. 'We lost all the swing states. We lost in every county in America,' said Lindy Li, a member of the DNC finance committee. 'This is just astounding. This is not some like blip. This is an avalanche.' 'How do you raise a historic amount of money and not win a single swing state?' a Harris aide asked. 'The honest answer is: I don't know. It seems we lost the national narrative, and that's what we need to diagnose.'

Study links brain stability to treatments for depression, epileps...	Depression, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and other disorders are linked to disruptions in neural stability. By Pesach Benson, TPS New scientific research on how the brain maintains stability amidst continuous environmental and physiological changes offers potential new approaches to treat disorders such as depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy, Israeli researchers said on Thursday. For decades, research has concentrated on how the brain learns and remembers—processes dependent on changes in synaptic connections. However, a Tel Aviv University study found that homeostasis — the brain’s stability — is a foundation for all cognitive functions. Without this stability, processes like learning, memory, and even basic neural communication could falter. 'While brain research has historically focused on synaptic changes that underpin learning and memory, the fundamental stability—or homeostasis—of the brain is equally critical,' said Tel Aviv University Prof. Inna Slutsky Slutsky, in whose laboratory investigated the mechanisms that maintain this balance. Depression, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and other disorders are linked to disruptions in neural stability. The study, published in the peer-reviewed journal, Neuron, zeroed in on NMDA receptors (NMDARs), a type of glutamate receptor found in the brain and nervous system. They play a key role in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and the regulation of neural activity. The research employed three complementary methods: electrophysiological recordings from cultured neurons and living mice, coupled with computational modeling. This comprehensive approach provided a deep understanding of how NMDARs stabilize neural networks. Dr. Antonella Ruggiero, one of the research leaders, utilized an innovative 'dual perturbation' technique developed in Slutsky’s lab. Initially, neurons were exposed to ketamine, a known NMDAR blocker. Under normal conditions, neural networks recover from disruptions, gradually returning to baseline activity levels. However, with NMDAR blocked, the recovery failed, and activity levels remained suppressed. Subsequently, a second disruption was introduced by blocking another receptor. This time, activity recovered but to a new, lower baseline, highlighting NMDAR’s role in setting and maintaining the activity baseline. 'These findings suggest that NMDAR blockers like ketamine impact behavior not only through synaptic plasticity but also by altering the brain’s homeostatic set points,' Ruggiero explained. Further experiments revealed that NMDAR activity activates a calcium-dependent signaling pathway, eEF2K-BDNF, linked to ketamine’s antidepressant effects. Co-leader Leore Heim extended these findings to live animals, focusing on the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory and learning. By infusing NMDAR blockers directly into the hippocampus and recording long-term neural activity, Heim observed a consistent decrease in activity across various states, such as wakefulness and sleep. 'This method allowed us to isolate the hippocampus, avoiding the variability seen in previous studies where drugs were administered systemically,' said Heim. 'Our results demonstrate that NMDARs set the activity baseline in hippocampal networks, with no compensatory recovery after their inhibition.' To understand whether brain stability occurs at the network or individual neuron level, co-leader Dr. Lee Susman developed computational models. His findings indicated that stability is achieved through network-level mechanisms, where averaging activity across neurons reduces noise and enhances signal processing. 'While individual neurons exhibit activity drift, the overall network maintains stability, providing significant computational benefits,' Susman said. The study’s findings could open new avenues of treatment for depression, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s. Ketamine, which blocks NMDARs, was FDA-approved in 2008 as a rapid-acting antidepressant. Overactivity in certain brain regions, such as the lateral habenula, contributes to depression. The study suggests that ketamine could help by resetting this overactivity to a healthier baseline. Understanding how NMDARs stabilize neural networks could lead to treatments preventing epileptic episodes. And targeting NMDARs could help maintain brain function as Alzheimer’s progresses. 'This could pave the way for novel treatments that target neural stability without disrupting essential homeostatic processes,' said Slutsky.

Trump’s top national security picks have expressed strongly pro-I...	Among his top national security picks, the president-elect has chosen the US. Rep. Mike Waltz to serve as his national security adviser and nominated Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner US President-elect Donald Trump’s selections for national security adviser and defense secretary have a history of making statements in support of Israel’s right to defend itself from neighboring threats. In the week following his resounding victory at the polls, Trump has swiftly moved to fill his incoming cabinet with allies of Israel. Among his top national security picks, the president-elect has chosen US. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL) to serve as his national security adviser and nominated Fox News host and Army National Guard officer Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense. Waltz, a Green Beret and former Pentagon policy adviser, has developed a hawkish reputation on foreign policy matters. He supported Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Iran in October, arguing that the Jewish state should target Kharg Island, a major hub of the regime’s oil exports. The representative also suggested that Israel attack Iran’s nuclear facilities outside of Tehran. The lawmaker has openly criticized the Biden administration for allegedly holding Israel back from a full force retaliation against Iran. Waltz has also argued that the US should attempt to weaken Iran through sanctioning the Chinese buyers of Iranian oil, saying that isolating Iran economically would cripple their ability to finance the operations of terrorist groups such as Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah. He has also helped spearhead bipartisan efforts to recategorize the Houthis in Yemen as an official international terrorist organization, a move that he argues would isolate the group by making financial transactions with them illegal. On Tuesday, Trump raised eyebrows by tapping Hegseth to head the Pentagon. Hegseth, a former infantry officer in the Army National Guard deployed to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, has repeatedly expressed affinity for Israel. Hegseth, a devout Christian, argued on television that Jews have a right to live in Israel on Biblical grounds. In his 2020 book, American Crusade, Our Fight to Stay Free, he stated that Israel is 'central to the story of Western civilization' and that the Jewish state is 'inextricably linked' to America. 'If you love America, you should love Israel. We share history, we share faith, and we share freedom. We love free people, free expression, and free markets,' he wrote. 'And whereas America is blessed with two big, beautiful oceans to protect it, Israel is surrounded on all sides by countries that either used to seek, or still seek, to wipe the nation off the map.' During a 2016 trip to Israel, Hegseth said that he was 'struck by the pervasive sense of purpose which permeates Israel and its people who understand the special nature of its founding and defense.' He also said that America can 'learn from Israel' and that the Jewish state 'is indispensable for the future of the West and human freedom.' Following the 2020 killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, who headed the Quds Force responsible for overseeing Iran’s proxies and terrorist operations abroad, Hegseth urged then-President Trump to bomb Iran’s nuclear production facilities. 'I happen to believe that we can’t kick the can down the road any longer in trying to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb. They used the killing of Soleimani as an excuse to say ‘we’re scrapping the Iran Deal.’ We all know they were scrapping it anyway,' Hegseth said on Fox News, adding that America should notify Iran of its plans to destroy its 'nuclear production facilities,' 'key infrastructure,' 'missile sites,' and 'port capabilities.' Hegseth also argued that attempts to restrain Israel from direct confrontation with Iran are 'ridiculous' and that the Islamic regime represents an 'existential threat' to the Jewish state. 'Israel wants to deal with Iran, we should let them … If it was not for Israel, Iran would have had the bomb already,' he said.

IDF: Over 140 Hezbollah launchers destroyed in Southern Lebanon	In the past week, the IDF has eliminated over 200 Hezbollah operatives in Southern Lebanon in air and ground operations, according to the IDF. By JNS Over 140 Hezbollah rocket launchers in Southern Lebanon were destroyed by Israeli airstrikes over the past week, the Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday. The launchers posed an immediate threat to Israeli civilians and troops, according to the military. Among the launchers destroyed were the ones used in attacks on the Western Galilee area on Wednesday night, as well as those used in attacks on central Israel on both Wednesday and Tuesday, the IDF said. מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר, בהכוונת פיקוד הצפון, תקפו והשמידו במהלך השבוע האחרון יותר מ-140 משגרים של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה בדרום לבנון בסגירות מעגל מהירות. משגרים אלו היוו איום מיידי על העורף הישראלי ועל כוחות צה'ל אשר פועלים בדרום לבנון>> pic.twitter.com/54wHV5hANq &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 14, 2024 On Tuesday, the IAF eliminated a battalion commander and an anti-tank missile commander of Hezbollah’s Radwan Force in the coastal region. A Radwan Force company commander was also killed. In the past week, the IDF has eliminated over 200 Hezbollah operatives in Southern Lebanon in air and ground operations, according to the IDF. 'These strikes further degrade Hezbollah’s capability to carry out terror attacks from Southern Lebanon against Israeli civilians on the northern border,' the army said. 'The IDF will continue to operate to thwart any danger or threat against the State of Israel.' IDF ground operations in Southern Lebanon continued on Thursday as part of 'Operation Northern Arrows,' with troops over the past 24 hours locating and dismantling rocket and mortar launchers, as well as terrorist infrastructure, including underground sites and several explosives stockpiles. כוחות צה'ל ממשיכים לפעול בדרום לבנון. לוחמי צוות הקרב של חטיבה 226, בפיקוד אוגדה 146, החלו לפעול במרחב נגד ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה>> pic.twitter.com/BtahXClghk &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 14, 2024 In addition, the IAF conducted over 100 air strikes over the past 24 hours, targeting command centers, weapons storage facilities, launchers and terror infrastructure. Meanwhile, Hezbollah continued its rocket attacks on Israel on Thursday morning, triggering sirens in several communities in the country’s north. On Wednesday, Hezbollah launched 50 rockets into Israeli territory.

Israel, Hezbollah ‘closer than ever’ to a ceasefire, says ministe...	Israeli government minister says that Jerusalem and the Iranian-backed terror group are closer than ever to reaching a ceasefire deal, but one major sticking point remains. By World Israel News Staff Israel and the Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah are now closer than ever before to reaching a deal which would enable the two to enter into a long-term ceasefire, a senior Israeli government minister said Thursday. After 404 days since large-scale attacks by Hezbollah terrorists began along the Israel-Lebanon frontier, efforts by the U.S. to broker a ceasefire are now 'closer' than they have been than at any other time 'since the start of the war,' Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen (Likud) told Reuters in an interview published Thursday afternoon. 'I think we are at a point that we are closer to an arrangement than we have been since the start of the war,' Cohen said. Ever since Israeli forces entered southern Lebanon on October 1st, the Biden administration has sought to secure a truce between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel has demanded that the Iranian proxy group withdraw away from the Israeli frontier to the northern bank of the Litani River, and that the IDF retain the right to operate in Lebanon should Hezbollah violate the agreement. Furthermore, Israel has sought mechanisms to ensure the disarming of the Shi'ite Muslim terror group. Recent reports claim that Russia has joined the U.S. effort to broker a deal, with Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer reportedly visiting Russia as part of ceasefire talks last week, before meeting with U.S. Secretary of State this week. Nevertheless, despite the progress made, Cohen emphasized that there still remain some obstacles to a deal, including Hezbollah's refusal to accept Israel's insistence on retaining the right to operate in Lebanon should the terror group abrogate a future deal. 'We will be less forgiving than in the past over attempts to create strongholds in territory near Israel,' Cohen said.

‘Critical condition’ – Israeli hostages may have lost half of the...	Israeli captives still held in the Gaza Strip likely have suffered severe starvation for over a year and are at high risk for malnutrition and freezing as winter approaches, experts warn. By World Israel News Staff Dozens of Israeli hostages still being held hostage by terrorists in the Gaza Strip have likely lost roughly half of their body weight over the past thirteen months and are at increasing risk of malnutrition and frostbite as winter approaches, experts warned in a report Wednesday. On Wednesday night, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum's health team, headed by epidemiologist and former chairman of Israel's Association of Public Health Physicians Dr. Hagai Levine, released a report regarding the conditions of the surviving Israeli captives held hostage in the Gaza Strip. Of the 101 captives still in Gaza, Israeli intelligence suggests that 50 are most likely dead, with 51 believed to be still alive. In its report Wednesday, the Health Team of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said that given the duration and conditions the captives have been held in since October 7th, 2023, they have likely lost a significant amount of body mass, potentially as much as half of their pre-invasion weight. As a consequence of their long-term nutritional deficiencies, the report warns, the surviving hostages are likely suffering from 'dangerously low muscle' mass levels, and are now 'highly vulnerable to hypothermia, frostbite, and respiratory infections,' leaving them at elevated risk for a plethora of maladies in the upcoming winter season. The Health Team also wrote that the hostages are likely suffering from severe mental health issues, including 'despair and suicidal thoughts,' fueled by 'psychological trauma from isolation, violence, and lack of family contact.' 'The captives are in critical condition,' tweeted Dr. Levine Wednesday night, calling the new report 'hair-raising.' 'Those who have survived are in immediate danger of death due to many threats.'

US Muslim group accuses Biden of ‘war crimes’ for refusing to imp...	CAIR accuses President Biden and senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Blinken and Secretary of Defense Austin, of being 'war criminals' after White House declines to impose arms embargo on Israel. By World Israel News Staff The largest Muslim advocacy group in the United States has accused President Joe Biden and other senior administration officials of being war criminals, after the administration declined to impose an arms embargo on Israel this week. On Wednesday, the 30-day deadline set by the administration for Israel to come into compliance with the October 13th memorandum demanding changes in the Gaza Strip expired. The Biden administration had hinted that unless Israel made satisfactory changes to reduce the isolation of northern Gaza, ensure the entry of additional aid trucks, and lessen the use of mass evacuation orders in Gaza, the White House would restrict the transfer of military equipment to Israel. On the eve of the deadline, however, the State Department announced that it had not determined Israel to be in violation of the memorandum, thereby avoiding a confrontation with Jerusalem. The Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a group linked in the past to the Hamas terror organization which appeared after the October 7th, 2023 invasion of Israel to defend the group's actions, on Wednesday castigated Biden and other senior administration officials over the decision not to limit arms transfers to Israel. In a statement released by CAIR, the organization accused Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin of war crimes. 'We strongly condemn President Biden’s decision to continue illegally supplying the Israeli government with deadly weapons even after Benjamin Netanyahu violated the 30-day deadline that the administration set for Israel to stop starving Gaza,' CAIR said in a statement Wednesday. 'We never thought this day would come, but we must speak the truth plainly and clearly: President Biden is a war criminal. So is Antony Blinken. So is Lloyd Austin. We condemn them in the strongest terms, and so will history.'

Next US Defense Secretary backed reestablishment of Jewish Temple...	In 2018, Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's choice for Secretary of Defense, shared his thoughts on the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. By World Israel News Staff The next American Secretary of Defense, Fox News journalist and army veteran Pete Hegseth, has made comments in the past seemingly endorsing the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, Arutz Sheva reported Thursday. Former President and President-elect Donald Trump announced his selection of Hegseth on Tuesday to head the Pentagon, touting Hegseth as a 'tough, smart and a true believer in America First.' A long-time and vocal supporter of Israel, Hegseth also appeared in a pro-Israel conference six years ago to lend support to Jewish aspirations to rebuild the historic Temple on Jerusalem's Temple Mount. In 2018, Hegseth addressed the annual Arutz Sheva - Israel National News conference, during which he lauded then-President Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital city and relocating the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. 'When you stand there, you cannot help but behold the miracle before you,' Hegseth said. 'It got me thinking about another miracle I hope all of you don't see as too far away,' Hegseth continued, suggesting that like the Balfour Declaration, the establishment of the State of Israel, and the liberation of the Old City of Jerusalem, the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem is attainable. '1917 was a miracle, 1948 was a miracle, 1967 was a miracle, 2017, the declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was a miracle, and there's no reason why the miracle of the reestablishment of the Temple on the Temple Mount is not possible.' 'I don't know how it would happen, you don't know how it would happen, but I know that it could happen, that's all I know.' Hegseth went on to back the extension of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, calling it the 'critical next step' for Israel.

Israel questions fitness of ICC judge to investigate Netanyahu	Beti Hohler had previously served in the prosecutor’s office of the international court. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel is questioning the impartiality of one of the three judges probing whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant should be arrested for war crimes by the International Criminal Court (ICC), Reuters reported Wednesday. Slovenian judge Beti Hohler was appointed three weeks ago following the resignation of the presiding judge, Romanian justice Iulia Motoc, for health reasons. Reuters saw a statement sent to the court by Israel’s Attorney General's office asking for Hohler to 'provide information to clarify whether there are (or are not) grounds to reasonably doubt her impartiality,' considering that her previous position had been to serve as an attorney in the ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor (OTP). 'Israel does not suggest that judge Hohler's previous employment with the OTP necessarily or automatically gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of a lack of impartiality,' the statement said. 'However, judges of this Court have acknowledged that previous duties within the OTP may, depending on the circumstances, give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.' This request may further delay the panel’s decision on whether to indict Netanyahu and Gallant for their alleged 'criminal responsibility for&#8230;war crimes and crimes against humanity' in the Gaza Strip during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The request for an arrest warrant, made in May by ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, also included three Hamas heads for their leading roles in the invasion of Israel last October 7, in which Hamas-led terrorists massacred 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, 97 of whom, both dead and alive, are still in captivity. Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh and Mohammed Deif have since been killed by Israel, although Haniyeh’s death in Tehran was not officially acknowledged as an Israeli hit job. Israel, along with several of its allies and legal organizations, had previously submitted official challenges to the warrant. These outlined the ICC's 'manifest lack of jurisdiction' in the case and charged that the court was violating its own statutes by 'failing to provide Israel with the opportunity to exercise its right to investigate by itself the claims raised by the Prosecutor, before proceeding,' the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in its accompanying statement in September. 'No other democracy with an independent and respected legal system like that which exists in Israel has been treated in this prejudicial manner by the Prosecutor,' the Ministry added. Khan, who had asked that the judges make a quick decision when presenting the arrest request, has since become the subject of an external investigation due to complaints by a former underling that he had made many improper and unwanted sexual advances to her while she worked in his office.

EU’s top diplomat calls to end cooperation with Israel, breaking ...	European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell proposes measure to suspend decades-old agreement with Israel and end 'political dialog' with the Jewish state, citing ongoing war with Hamas. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The European Union's foreign affairs chief is calling on the 27-state body to dramatically limit the EU's ties with Israel, accusing the Jewish state of human rights violations in connection with the ongoing war against the Hamas terror organization. On Wednesday, Josep Borrell, the Spanish lawmaker currently serving as High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, penned a missive to the foreign ministers representing the EU's 27 member states ahead of a joint meeting scheduled for Monday. In the letter, Borrell proposed suspending the June 2000 EU-Israel Association Agreement, which upgraded ties between Israel and the EU and established a formal, legal framework for political dialog between the two aimed at facilitating better relations and closer cooperation. The agreement established a committee and council to ensure regular communication between Israel and the EU. Borrell, however, called to suspend the 'political dialog' enshrined under the agreement, accusing Israel of human rights violations in the Gaza Strip. 'In light of the above considerations, I will be tabling a proposal that the EU should invoke the human rights clause to suspend the political dialog with Israel,' Borrell wrote, according to a report by Reuters. Borrell was quoted as citing 'serious concerns about possible breaches of international humanitarian law in Gaza,' while claiming that 'thus far, these concerns have not been sufficiently addressed by Israel.' According to the report, which cited three diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity, a number of European Union member state foreign ministers raised issues with the proposal Wednesday, signaling that Borrell was unlikely to secure the unanimous support necessary to move forward with his plan. Monday's meeting marks the last joint meeting of EU foreign ministers that Borrell is expected to lead before leaving office on December 1st. Borrell has long criticized Israeli policy, and has frequently been at odds with Jerusalem regarding its wars against the Hamas and Hezbollah terror organizations after October 7th, 2023. In March, Borrell accused Israel of 'provoking famine' in the Gaza Strip, while calling Gaza the world’s 'greatest open-air prison' and 'greatest open-air graveyard.' In August, he proposed that the EU sanction two senior Israeli government ministers, leading the Israeli government to bar him from entering the country while still in office.

CIA agent arrested for leaking Israeli Iran attack info	Asif W. Rahman was arrested in Cambodia and indicted under the Espionage Act. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A CIA agent was arrested by the FBI Tuesday for leaking highly classified information on Israel’s planned attack on Iran following the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile barrage on the Jewish state on October 1st. Asif W. Rahman was arrested in Cambodia and brought to federal court in Guam to be charged under the Espionage Act with two counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information. Rahman had top-secret security clearance, which would allow him to see the classified files that included satellite photos of possible target sites, which were prepared mid-month by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. According to CNN, one of the documents also indicated that Israel has nuclear weapons, something that the Jewish state has never confirmed, preferring to keep the extremely sensitive issue officially ambiguous. They were marked 'top secret' and for viewing by the 'Five Eyes' allies only, namely the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The leak occurred 'on or about October 17,' the indictment said, with the documents appearing on a Telegram account called 'Middle East Spectator,' which is operated out of Iran and is used to propagate the regime’s messaging. The account said that it had received the documents anonymously and could not authenticate their contents. 'It is very troubling to know that a CIA officer may have been involved in leaking this highly classified information,' Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, told The New York Post. 'Everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence, but if true, this is a serious security breach and there is no excuse for it,' he added. The Americans apologized to Israel after the leak was discovered and immediately opened an investigation to find those responsible. In the event, the leak seemingly did not affect the eventual Israeli retaliation on October 26, in which more than 120 planes and UAVs attacked sites throughout Iran and destroyed its most advanced anti-missile systems and most of its air defenses, as well as military facilities that produced vital ballistic missile components and mixed solid fuel for the missiles. The Justice Department has asked that Rahman’s trial be moved to the federal court in Virginia.

Soros-backed dark money giant bankrolled the fiscal sponsor of US...	In 2023, the Tides network raked in nearly $800 million, according to its audited financial statements. By Andrew Kerr, The Washington Free Beacon The Tides Foundation, a left-wing dark money giant backed by George Soros and other progressive billionaires, bankrolled the fiscal sponsor of the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, an anti-Semitic group sanctioned in the United States for providing financial support to terrorists, according to newly released tax forms. The foundation reported in its latest Form 990 tax return that it granted $286,000 to the Alliance for Global Justice in 2023, a group best known for serving as the fiscal sponsor of Samidoun. The Treasury Department in October sanctioned Samidoun as a 'sham charity' that provided material support to a Palestinian terrorist organization that participated in the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist rampage in Israel. Canada levied its own sanctions against Samidoun as well in October, labeling the group a 'terrorist entity' under its criminal code. Founded in 1998, the Alliance for Global Justice let Samidoun borrow its charitable tax privileges to operate and raise funds in the United States without obtaining its own organizational credentials. In other words, the Alliance for Global Justice and Samidoun are legally indistinguishable. It’s unclear if the group continued to serve as Samidoun’s fiscal sponsor after the Treasury Department sanctioned the terrorism financier in October. The Tides Foundation said the purpose of its grant to the Alliance for Global Justice in 2023 was to support a 'sustainable environment.' It’s unclear if the Tides grant went to support Samidoun or one of the several dozen other fiscally sponsored organizations operating under the Alliance for Global Justice’s tax ID. The Treasury Department in October described Samidoun as a 'sham charity that serves as an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) terrorist organization.' The PFLP cut its teeth in the late 1960s by hijacking and opening fire on commercial airplanes, and later participated in the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel. It leverages Samidoun as a front organization in both Europe and North America to bankroll its terrorist activities, the Treasury Department said in October. Samidoun is also banned in Germany for its overt support of Hamas terrorism. Samidoun’s U.S. leaders don’t shy away from their terroristic tendencies. Its leaders, Charlotte Kates and her husband, Khaled Barakat, explicitly endorsed terrorism against Jews during a lecture in March before the anti-Israel student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the Washington Free Beacon reported. The Treasury Department sanctioned Barakat in October for his 'fundraising and recruitment' efforts for the PFLP’s 'terrorist activity against Israel,' adding that he has publicly acknowledged Samidoun’s affiliation with the terrorist network. Tides and the Alliance for Global Justice did not return requests for comment. Major donors to the Tides network include liberal billionaire financier George Soros, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and the Ford Foundation. In 2023, the Tides network raked in nearly $800 million, according to its audited financial statements. The Tides network is hardly the only liberal dark money giant to bankroll the Alliance for Global Justice. In 2021, Tides and the New Venture Fund, the largest branch of the Arabella Advisors dark money behemoth, donated more than $9 million to the Alliance for Global Justice. The Arabella Advisors network donated an additional $1 million to the Alliance for Global Justice in 2022, the Free Beacon reported. The Arabella Advisors network distanced itself from Samidoun after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, telling the Free Beacon that Samidoun 'is not and has never been a client of Arabella Advisors' and that it 'unequivocally condemn[s] terrorism and violence against civilians.' The Tides network has offered no such denunciation of the terrorism financier.

Oldest spindle whorls found in Israel: Early textile tools rewrit...	The Natufians, who lived 11,500-15,000 years ago, were among the earliest groups to settle in permanent or semi-permanent villages. By Pesach Benson, TPS Researchers uncovered 12,000-year-old spindle whorls in northern Israel, predating previously known textile tools in the region by 4,000 years, Hebrew University announced on Wednesday. The artifacts, associated with the Natufian culture, mark a pivotal moment in human technological development as societies transitioned from hunting and gathering to agriculture. A spindle whorl is a small, weighted tool used in spinning fibers into yarn or thread. It is typically a round or disk-shaped object with a hole in the center, designed to be attached to a spindle stick, which is a thin rod. Together, they form a simple tool for transforming raw fibers, like wool, flax, or cotton, into usable thread for weaving or other textile processes. The study, led by Talia Yashuv and Professor Leore Grosman from the Hebrew University’s Institute of Archaeology, used advanced digital 3D modeling to analyze more than 100 perforated limestone pebbles recovered from the Nahal-Ein Gev II dig site near the Sea of Galilee. Experimental replicas successfully demonstrated their function, affirming their role in early textile production. 'These Natufian perforated stones are actually the first wheels in form and function,' Grosman explained. 'They represent an early iteration of wheel-based technology, long before the invention of the wheel for transport.' The Natufians, who lived 11,500-15,000 years ago, were among the earliest groups to settle in permanent or semi-permanent villages. They built stone and mud structures, some of which included circular or oval houses with stone foundations. 'This study emphasizes the Natufians’ role as technological pioneers,' said Yashuv. 'Their innovations laid the groundwork for future breakthroughs like the potter’s wheel and the cart, shaping the trajectory of human history.' The findings were published in the peer-reviewed PLOS ONE journal.

Students for Justice in Palestine group loses lawsuit against Col...	Both SJP and JVP have been instrumental in organizing disruptive anti-Israel protests on Columbia’s campus. By Dion J. Pierre, The Algemeiner A New York judge has upheld Columbia University’s suspension of its Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter, a measure taken against the campus group after it launched of spree of assaults, hate campaigns, and disruptive protests following the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel last Oct. 7. SJP, as well as its affiliate pro-Hamas partner Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), sued the university in March, alleging that its suspension perpetuated 'already pervasive dangerous stereotypes about Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims,' and other minority groups. Represented by the New York chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the groups sought to have their status restored by appealing to the courts, as well as the public, whom it attempted to convince that Columbia University, one of the most culturally left-wing higher education institutions in the country, discriminates against minorities of color. The strategy proved unsuccessful last week, as Judge Nicholas Moyne of the New York State Supreme Court, who presided over the case, ruled that the university had sufficient cause to suspend the two groups. 'After reviewing the record, the court finds that Columbia University’s decision to temporarily suspend the petitioners from their status as recognized student groups was neither arbitrary or capricious, irrational, or in violation of clearly established university policies,' Moyne said in his decision. 'Accordingly, the petition is denied and the cross-motion to dismiss the petition is granted. All student groups at Columbia are subject to and required to comply with Columbia’s special events policies, which govern, inter alia, when, where, and how events on campus, including protests and demonstrations, may be held and what notice needs to be given to university officials prior to the commencement of any student group events, demonstrations, or protests.' Columbia University suspended SJP and JVP in last November, explaining in a statement that the groups had 'repeatedly violated university policies related to holding campus events, culminating in an unauthorized event … that proceeded despite warnings and included threatening rhetoric and intimidation.' Both SJP and JVP have been instrumental in organizing disruptive anti-Israel protests on Columbia’s campus since Hamas invaded Israel last Oct. 7 and killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Even after being disciplined, however, SJP members continued their activities in front groups — such as Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), a non-campus affiliated organization that supports the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel — staging more protests in flagrant violation of the terms of its suspension. ACLU’s portrayal of pro-Hamas students as peaceful and artistic victims of racism has always been in tension with how Jewish Columbia students have described their behavior and the university’s response to it. Anti-Israel activists have chanted 'F— the Jews,' 'Death to Jews,' 'Jews will not defeat us,' and 'From water to water, Palestine will be Arab,' on campus grounds since the Oct. 7 atrocities, violating the school’s code of conduct, according to a lawsuit filed against Columbia University earlier this year by StandWithUs, a Jewish civil rights organization. In other alleged incidents, they allegedly beat up five Jewish students in Columbia’s Butler Library and attacked another with a stick, lacerating his head and breaking his finger. Anti-Jewish violence and hatred became so common, the lawsuit charged, that Columbia told Jewish students that campus security could no longer guarantee their safety. Jewish victims at Columbia have prevailed in other lawsuits filed against the university in recent months. In June, the university’s legal counsel settled a case in which it was accused of neglecting its obligation to foster a safe learning environment amid riotous pro-Hamas protests that were held at the school throughout the final weeks of the 2023-2024 academic year. The resolution of the case, first reported by Reuters, called for Columbia to hire a 'Safe Passage Liaison' who will monitor protests and 'walking escorts' who will accompany students whose safety is threatened around the campus. Other details of the settlement include 'accommodations' for students whose academic lives are disrupted by protests and new security policies for controlling access to school property. 'We’re pleased we’ve been able to come to a resolution and remain committed to our number one priority: the safety of our campus so that all of our students can successfully pursue their education and meet their academic goals,' the university told The Algemeiner after the settlement was announced. The university is the target of another pro-Hamas lawfare suit in which the plaintiff is on the record promoting antisemitic hatred. In October, the school was sued for discrimination by a student, Khymani James, whom officials suspended for filming himself proclaim that Zionists should be murdered and are fortunate that he has not begun killing them himself. James alleges that the suspension — prompted by the incident and other misconduct charges Columbia filed against him for participating in an illegal pro-Hamas encampment — was racist and aimed at 'privileging a subset of Jewish people.'

IDF strikes Syria-Lebanon border for second time in week, Damascu...	The IAF strikes targeted bridges and military checkpoints in the border region. By JNS Syrian state media reported on Wednesday evening that Israeli Air Force fighter jets conducted aerial raids in the area of Al-Qusayr, near the Arab Republic’s western border with Lebanon. Damascus state-run SANA news agency claimed that the country’s air defenses 'confronted hostile targets in the skies of the western Homs countryside' in response to what it described as 'Israeli aggression.' The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based war monitor with links to the country’s opposition, reported that the IAF strikes targeted bridges and military checkpoints in the border region. The Israeli Air Force previously carried out raids on Hezbollah targets in Al-Qusayr on Nov. 5, attacking munitions depots used by the Lebanon-based Iranian-backed terrorist army. 'Hezbollah’s Munitions Unit is responsible for storing weapons inside Lebanon and has recently expanded its activities into the area of Al-Qusayr, near the Syria-Lebanon border,' the military confirmed on X. Israeli jets also struck terrorism-related targets in Al-Qusayr on Oct. 31, including arms-storage facilities, and command and control centers used by Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force and its Munitions Unit. On Sunday, Arab media reported that a Hezbollah terrorist commander convicted for the 2005 murder of former Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri was eliminated in one of the IAF airstrikes on Al-Qusayr. Israel rarely acknowledges attacking Syria; however, in February, Jerusalem revealed that it had struck more than 50 targets belonging to Hezbollah and other Iranian terror proxies in the country since Oct. 7, 2023. Earlier this week, Israeli jets reportedly attacked Hezbollah targets near Shinshar on the outskirts of Homs, killing nine terrorist operatives. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that the IAF strikes targeted an ammunition storage facility on the Homs-Damascus road.

Ceremony honoring October 7th mastermind will take place in Canad...	City in Ontario refuses to shut down planned vigil in public square honoring Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief and architect of the October 7th massacres. By World Israel News Staff Pro-Hamas activists in Canada are planning to hold a public vigil honoring the architect of the October 7th massacres of Israelis, after municipal officials announced they would not interfere with the planned event. The event is set to be held on Tuesday, November 26th, at Mississauga City Hall’s Celebration Square in Mississauga, a city of 718,000 in the greater Toronto area. Flyers advertising the event were spotted last week, using the poppy flower symbol, established by the Royal Canadian Legion as a way to pay tribute to Canadian veterans, next to a photograph of the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar with the words 'Lest We Forget Our Heroes: Vigil For Resistance Leaders.' One advertisement said the event would commemorate '40 days after the Martyrdom of the leaders of Resistance fighting for Palestinian freedom.' No organization has been linked to the planned event, with only an email address, allheavens313@gmail.com, provided in the ads. Advertisement for a vigil honoring Yahya Sinwar in the Canadian city of Mississauga. (X) An anti-Israel activist, Faris Al Najim, released a video on November 11th, Remembrance Day, announcing the event in honor of Sinwar. The City of Mississauga has come under fire after city officials announced they would not be interfering with the planned event. 'The City of Mississauga has become aware of a vigil planned for November 26, 2024 to take place on Celebration Square,' city officials said in a statement. 'The City has not issued a permit for this group to host a vigil. It is not the City’s practice to issue permits for vigils as Celebration Square is a public space, usable by the community. Under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, groups have the right of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The City will not interfere with a peaceful vigil, as long as all laws and City by-laws are adhered to.' Social media users were quick to point out that the event constitutes promotion of Hamas, which Canada has banned as a terror organization. 'Everybody knows if the KKK were to hold a rally honouring the death of their leader, it would not be permitted to happen any more than if a bunch of Nazis decided to mark Hitler’s birthday,' columnist Joe Warmington wrote in the Toronto Sun. 'Hamas is not any different and is a banned terror group in Canada. Celebrating them is obscene — and hurtful to the families of their victims.' The Royal Canadian Legion has penned a cease-and-desist letter to the event’s organizers over their unauthorized use of the Legion’s poppy flower symbol. Mississauga Mayor Carolyn Parrish defended the city’s refusal to bar the event, saying any such steps would constitute 'preferential treatment.' 'That would be called censorship, preferential treatment, being judgmental — the stifling of freedom of speech which is something most Canadians value,' the mayor tweeted. On Monday night, Parrish appeared to deny that the event was actually going to be held, suggesting the ads were part of a hoax. 'Consulted a network of Muslim organizations, serious partners in many activities of our city - coaching sports, walkathons for Trillium Hospital and diabetes. I asked them to track down the anonymous notice for a vigil at City Hall. No organization exists. No vigil is planned,' the mayor tweeted.

US hostages’ families urge Trump-Biden collaboration to free capt...	Trump warned that that if Hamas does not release the hostages before he takes office on January 20, the terror group will pay '​​a very big price.' By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden met with the families of American citizens kidnapped on October 7th and held hostage in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, hosting them at the White House. Biden 'provided an update on US efforts to secure the release of all hostages, and reaffirmed the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to getting the hostages home to their loved ones and families,' read a White House statement about the meeting. 'The Administration has worked tirelessly to get a deal done as soon as possible to bring the hostages home, and the President also assured the families those efforts will continue,' the statement added. 'Our aim is to encourage the outgoing administration to collaborate vigorously and decisively with the incoming administration to resolve the situation and bring the hostages home. They must do whatever it takes,' Ronen Neutra, father of hostage Omer, told Ynet. Neutra referenced Trump's remarks at the Republican National Convention in July. At the time, Trump warned that that if Hamas does not release the hostages before he takes office on January 20, the terror group will pay '​​a very big price.' Neutra urged Biden and Trump to 'work with full force,' adding that 'ultimately, both leaders deserve credit if they succeed.' 'It's up to them now. We are very hopeful to hear from President Biden that this issue transcends party lines and that the teams will quickly commence joint work.' Jonthan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz more than a year ago, told the Times of Israel that he and the other hostages' families encouraged Biden to partner with Trump on ramping up efforts for a deal to release the captives. 'Our requests… of both administrations right now is they work together, not to prepare the Trump administration for taking office in late January, but rather to get this done now in this unique moment,' Dekel-Chen said. Dekel-Chen warned that if there is no deal until after president-elect Trump takes office in January, 'there’s a very real possibility that none of the hostages will remain alive, and it will be nearly impossible to retrieve the remains of those who have been murdered.'

Israel to ‘gift’ Trump with Lebanon ceasefire in January – Report	Israeli official claims that Israel will give Trump a major foreign policy win, soon after the president-elect takes office. By World Israel News Staff A senior aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told president-elect Donald Trump that Israel is gearing up for a ceasefire deal with Lebanon, in order to 'gift' the leader a major foreign-policy win once he takes office in January 2025. According to a Washington Post report, Ron Dermer - Netanyahu’s minister of strategic affairs - visited Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to update Trump and his team about the status of the ongoing ceasefire negotiations. Dermer confirmed to the Post that he had met with Trump and his associates, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, but declined to give specifics about the content of the discussions. 'There is an understanding that Israel would gift something to Trump … that in January there will be an understanding about Lebanon,' an anonymous Israeli official told the Post. 'The one thing Netanyahu cares more about than Trump is his own domestic politics, and getting Israeli civilians back to the north is a major objective that he may not want to wait on,' he said. Frank Lowenstein, a former special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under President Barack Obama, speculated that Israel may already have a blueprint in place for a temporary agreement. Once Trump assumes office, Lowenstein said, a permanent ceasefire may be signed. But, the strategist said that Netanyahu would prioritize his constituents over a potential gesture to the U.S. president. 'The one thing Netanyahu cares more about than Trump is his own domestic politics, and getting Israeli civilians back to the north is a major objective that he may not want to wait on,' he told the Post. Lebanese politicians have signaled that some Israeli conditions for the ceasefire - such as the ability of Israel to continue acting against Hezbollah in Lebanese territory, should the terror group violate the agreement - are unacceptable to Lebanon. 'Is there any sane person who believes that we will agree to a settlement or a solution that serves Israel’s interests at the expense of Lebanon’s interests and sovereignty?' Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri said Tuesday.

Defense Minister says Israel won’t accept Lebanon ceasefire unles...	The provision that Hezbollah should not be allowed south of the Litani River was included in the ceasefire that ended the Second Lebanon War. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Newly-appointed defense minister Israel Katz, when speaking to Northern Command on Wednesday, declared that Israel wouldn't accept a ceasefire deal with Lebanon unless it mandates the retreat of Hezbollah to the north of the Litani river and that the terror group disarms. The requirement that Hezbollah evacuate southern Lebanon, known as Resolution 1701, was a provision in the ceasefire agreement that ended the Second Lebanon War in 2006, but wasn't enforced effectively. Addressing Northern Command, Katz said, 'We will not agree to just any ceasefires, we will not take our foot off the gas, and we will not accept any agreement that does not include achieving the war goals.' Any agreement should include 'The disarmament of Hezbollah, its withdrawal beyond the Litani [River], and creating the conditions for the residents of the north to return to their homes in safety,' Katz explained. In addition, Israel said it should have the right to enforce any ceasefire deal and 'act against any terrorist activity and organization.' Regarding the progress of the war, Katz said, 'We have inflicted severe blows on Hezbollah, and we have eliminated Nasrallah - and therefore, precisely now, we need to continue to hit them with all our might to reap the fruits of victory. The United States has increased diplomatic activity because they aim for a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon before US President Joe Biden leaves office on January 20th. The US agrees with Israel's demand that Hezbollah retreat north of the Litani River, although US officials are searching for a way to enforce 1701, whereas Israel feels it should enforce the agreement. Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday to discuss the ceasefire deal proposed. France has also been involved in negotiations and its Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot visited Israel last week.

6 IDF soldiers killed in a battle with Hezbollah terrorists	The Golani soldiers were ambushed at short range by Hezbollah terrorists after entering a structure where the army had not yet operated. By JNS Six members of the Israel Defense Forces were killed on Wednesday morning in a firefight with Hezbollah terrorists in Southern Lebanon, while a seventh was moderately wounded, the military announced on Wednesday night. Five of the slain soldiers were identified as IDF Capt. Itay Marcovich, 21, from Kokhav Ya’ir; Staff Sgt. Sraya Elboim, 21, from Mehola; Staff Sgt. Dror Hen, 20, from Gan Haim; Staff. Sgt. Nir Gofer, 20, from Dimona; and Sgt. Shalev Itzhak Sagron, 21, from Sderot. All of them served in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion, the army said. The name of the last soldier killed was not yet approved for publication, local media reported, adding that his family had been informed. According to Israel’s Ynet outlet, the Golani soldiers were ambushed at short range by Hezbollah terrorists after entering a structure where the army had not yet operated. An hours-long firefight ensued, which ended with at least one terrorist dead and the area falling under IDF control. The military was said to have launched an investigation into suspicions that the terrorists emerged from an underground terror tunnel and were not harmed in the airstrikes that preceded the ground maneuver. On Tuesday morning, the IDF released the names of four troops killed in action fighting Hamas terrorists in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip. The IDF soldiers, members of the Kfir Brigade’s Shimshon Battalion 92, were identified as Staff Sgt. Orr Katz, 20, from Ma’ale Adumim; Staff Sgt. Nave Yair Asulin, 21, from Carmit; Staff Sgt. Gary Lalhruaikima Zolat, 21, from Afula; and Staff Sgt. Ofir Eliyahu, 20, from Holon. The death toll among Israeli troops since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist massacre now stands at 793, according to IDF figures. Additionally, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

FBI captures suspect in leaked intel on IDF Iran-strike prep	Court documents said Rahman held a top-secret security clearance with access to sensitive compartmentalized information. By JNS A U.S. government employee has been arrested and charged for leaking secret files related to Israel’s preparations to retaliate for Iran’s Oct. 1 missile attacks, according to court documents filed on Wednesday. The suspect, identified as Asif William Rahman, was indicted last week on two counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information. FBI agents arrested Rahman in Cambodia on Tuesday. Rahman, who according to The New York Times 'worked abroad' for the CIA, is set to make his first court appearance in Guam later this week. Court documents said Rahman held a top-secret security clearance with access to sensitive compartmentalized information, which the Times noted is typical for CIA employees who handle classified documents. The Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed on Oct. 22 that the agency was investigating the leak. 'The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and intelligence community,' it said. The FBI is leading the probe, U.S. officials briefed on the matter told CNN. Investigators were said to have been working to authenticate the files and determine who could have had access to them, they said. This is 'one indication that, for now, the FBI and other investigators are working off the theory that the breach most likely came from a government insider and not from a cyber intrusion,' CNN reported. At least one of the files appears to have been scanned from an officially printed briefing book, and the pool of people who printed these pages would be relatively small, sources familiar with U.S. intelligence said. Then-Republican candidate for the White House Donald Trump on Oct. 22 slammed the Biden administration for the leak, calling it 'bad thing.' 'They leaked all the information about the way that Israel’s going to fight and how they are going to fight and where they are going to go. And somebody—who did that? Can you imagine somebody doing that? That’s the enemy. I guess that maybe is the enemy from within, as I talked about,' Trump said during the campaign event in Doral, Fla. 'We have an enemy from within,' the Republican continued. 'They hate to talk about it. Can you imagine? So we just can’t stand for this incompetence anymore.' U.S. President Joe Biden is 'deeply concerned' over the intelligence leak, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters a day earlier. 'That is not supposed to happen, and it’s unacceptable when it does,' he said, adding that the president 'will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened.' Kirby said that it is not yet known how the documents were leaked and that the Department of Defense continues to investigate the incident. 'We don’t have any indication at this point that there’s an expectation that there’ll be additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,' he added in response to a question from reporters. Axios noted on Oct. 19 that the leak may have been an attempt to 'disrupt' Jerusalem’s plans to retaliate against Tehran and revealed close spying by the U.S. on the Jewish state, including with satellites.

El Al’s monopoly over US flights ends as Israir enters market	Since the Gaza war erupted last year, direct flights between Israel and major international destinations have been in limbo. By Jewish Breaking News El Al’s monopoly over direct flights to the United States will soon come to an end as Israir is set to launch service to Newark Airport. The airline has initiated talks with US regulators and is negotiating to wet-lease two wide-body aircraft, aiming to begin operations during the upcoming winter season. While the airline has secured preliminary approval from Israel’s Transportation Ministry, the full regulatory process typically takes three months, with officials working to expedite security clearances and landing rights. 'I thank the Civil Aviation Authority for their thorough work that enables significant relief in the flight crisis created due to the war. Israeli companies are demonstrating national responsibility in their mobilization during this challenging period,' stated Transportation Minister Miri Regev. 'I commend Israir Airlines for their initiative to operate a New York route, a step that will contribute to healthy competition, expanded options for the public, and lower flight prices.' Since the Gaza war erupted last year, direct flights between Israel and major international destinations have been in limbo. American Airlines has suspended its Israel routes through September 2025, United Airlines halted services indefinitely, and Delta suspended operations through March 2025, leaving El Al as the sole carrier maintaining direct service. Currently, a select group of international carriers maintains service to Israel. Middle Eastern airlines Emirates, Fly Dubai, and Etihad operate daily flights, while European carriers including Tarom, Hi-Sky, Fly One, Cyprus Airways, and Smartwings continue their routes, as well as Ethiopian Airlines, Hainan Airlines, and Uzbekistan Airways. Among Israeli carriers, El Al, Arkia, and Israir operate to multiple international destinations, while Air Haifa limits its service to flights between Tel Aviv and Larnaca.

Kamala Harris campaign gave $500k to Al Sharpton’s nonprofit week...	The Harris campaign, which ended $20 million in debt, leaned heavily on celebrities, influencers, and other high-profile Harris backers to make her case to voters. By Chuck Ross, The Washington Free Beacon Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign donated $500,000 to Al Sharpton’s nonprofit organization just weeks before the anti-Semitic MSNBC host—who once said that 'diamond merchant' Jews have the 'blood of innocent babies' on their hands—conducted a friendly interview with Harris. The campaign’s remittance to Sharpton’s National Action Network was part of a flurry of donations—$5.4 million in all—to black and Latino advocacy groups that seem aimed at winning Harris support from those constituencies. Harris’s campaign gave two payments of $250,000 to National Action Network on Sept. 5 and Oct. 1, according to campaign finance records. On Oct. 3, Sharpton aired a video of Harris wishing him happy birthday on his MSNBC weekend show, PoliticsNation with Al Sharpton. 'Happy birthday, Rev,' Harris said, using Sharpton’s nickname. 'You have been over all of your years such an extraordinary leader. You have been a voice of truth, a voice of conscience.' Sharpton, 70, conducted a glowing interview with Harris on Oct. 20 in which he touted her 'extraordinary historic campaign' while referring to Trump as 'hostile and erratic.' His questions lined up closely with messages that Harris sought to highlight on the campaign trail. Sharpton addressed concerns among black voters—especially black men—about Harris’s record as a prosecutor in California, where she was given the nickname 'Kamala the Cop.' Sharpton brought up Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress, and one of Harris’s personal heroes, to put Harris’s candidacy in historical perspective. Sharpton asked Harris whether men who opposed her were 'misogynistic.' Sharpton did not disclose payments from the Harris campaign during either segment with the candidate. National Action Network did not respond to requests for comment. MSNBC also did not respond to comment requests. Harris’s donations to National Action Network and similar groups were part of a $1 billion spending spree that has sparked heartache and soul-searching within the Democratic Party, which lost the popular vote to a Republican candidate for the first time since 2004. The campaign, which ended $20 million in debt, leaned heavily on celebrities, influencers, and other high-profile Harris backers to make her case to voters. Her campaign gave $1 million to the production company of Oprah Winfrey, and paid a six-figure sum to create a set for Harris’s interview on the Call Her Daddy podcast, the Washington Examiner reported. Team Harris donated to the National Urban League ($2 million), the Black Economic Alliance ($150,000), and Black Church PAC ($150,000). The campaign gave donations to lesser-known groups like the Haitian Ladies Fund ($30,000) and International Free and Accepted Modern Masons ($150,000), a black freemasons organization, according to campaign finance disclosures. The Black Economic Alliance hosted a video call for 5,000 attendees days before the election to urge black men to vote for Harris. Vote to Live Action Fund, which received $275,000 from the Harris campaign, launched a $4 million initiative in October to pressure black men to vote. Harris spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on an initiative to appeal to black church voters. Two of the organizations, Black Church PAC and the Institute of Church Administration and Management ($250,000), are linked to Frederick Haynes, an anti-Israel pastor who has worked with Harris for years on liberal causes. The campaign gave to Casa in Action ($120,000), the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada ($105,000), and Somos Votantes ($120,000), to mobilize Latino voters in Nevada, Pennsylvania, and other swing states. The lavish giveaways seemingly failed given Harris’s historically poor performance with black and Latino voters. Sharpton reportedly earns a seven-figure salary from MSNBC, and is paid handsomely by National Action Network, which he founded in 1991. The nonprofit paid Sharpton around $650,000 in 2021 out of $7 million in revenues, and spent another $940,000 that year for 'transportation services' to the private jet firm Apollo Jets and the limousine company Carey International. It’s not the first time Sharpton has faced conflict of interest concerns regarding donations to his group, which he launched in 1991. The tobacco company R.J. Reynolds has donated heavily to Sharpton’s network. Sharpton, for his part, has publicly opposed a ban on menthol cigarettes, raising concerns that the activist preacher is being paid off to promote a harmful product popular with black Americans. Sharpton has become an influential figure in mainstream Democratic circles after rising to national prominence in the 1990s for his involvement in anti-Semitic causes. He once taunted Jews to 'pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house.' In 1991, he provoked the Crown Heights riots in Brooklyn, one of the worst anti-Semitic outbursts in American history. In 1995, Sharpton protested against the Jewish owner of Freddy’s Fashion Mart, whom he called a 'white interloper.' A gunman who had attended Sharpton’s protests later murdered seven people in the store.

‘A huge relief’: Israelis react as Trump’s foreign policy team ta...	These appointments sound like a lot of good news, and this is a huge relief,' Elena, a 43-year-old financial manager in Tel Aviv, told The Press Service of Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israelis expressed satisfaction and 'relief' on Wednesday as US President-elect Donald Trump’s foreign policy team began taking shape. Trump has nominated former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee as US Ambassador to Israel, New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik as Ambassador to the United Nations, Florida Congressman Mike Waltz as National Security Advisor, and Fox News host Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense. Florida Senator Marco Rubio is widely expected to be nominated for Secretary of State. 'These appointments sound like a lot of good news, and this is a huge relief,' Elena, a 43-year-old financial manager in Tel Aviv, told The Press Service of Israel. 'People are joking that if things continue to go this way, Israel will be sanctioned for not being Zionist enough. On the other side, what we see now is just putting the figures on the chess board. Now we’ll need to play this game for the next four years and actually use this advantage to build a new position for Israel in the Middle East. And we can not forget that the tables may turn in the next elections.' Sderot carpenter Shmuel Mimoun told TPS-IL, 'We are very very glad that Trump has been elected, and we hope very much that this will change the picture of victory in Gaza and the picture of victory in Lebanon, and the Jewish people will live in pride and freedom in the Promised land.' The 28-year-old added, 'With God’s help, Trump will help to extend Jewish sovereignty to Judea and Samaria, and to build settlements in Gaza.' Other Israelis were more cautious in their approval. 'Trump gives the impression of a businessman, and from that it follows that he will take a deal that will be good in his eyes. Given this, it is difficult to know how truly loyal he is to Israel,' said Jerusalem music teacher Itshak Vinokur. Jerusalem biologist Sharon Eden said she had 'mixed feelings' about Trump’s presidency. 'On one hand, I do hope Trump and his new appointments will help Israel, and it’s gonna strengthen the ties between the US and Israel. He chose people who support Israel. And if there were a different government in Israel, I would be totally happy with it,' Eden said. However, she added, 'With the government that we have here in Israel, I’m afraid it’s gonna be too homogeneous. There is no balance. I saw that Trump chose someone who supports the settlements, and I’m afraid that given [National Security Minister Itamar] Ben-Gvir and [Finance Minister Bezalel] Smotrich in the Israeli government, it can be too much.' Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20.

Israel hits Hezbollah assets in Beirut, ‘erasing two decades of b...	Secondary explosions resulted from the strikes, confirming that weapons were being stored at the sites, according to the IDF. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israel has destroyed most of Hezbollah’s weapons storage sites and missile production facilities in the group’s stronghold in Dahieh, a southern suburb of Beirut, the Israel Defense Forces said on Tuesday. In recent weeks, a series of Israeli aerial strikes have been carried out to dismantle the terror infrastructure as part of 'Operation Northern Arrows' in Lebanon. According to the army, these sites were established over the past two decades in residential areas, systematically concealed beneath civilian buildings. Secondary explosions resulted from the strikes, confirming that weapons were being stored at the sites, according to the IDF. The military emphasized that Hezbollah directly endangers the residents of the Lebanese capital by concealing large quantities of explosives under residential structures, often without residents’ knowledge. Over the past 20 years, the Hezbollah terrorist organization has established dozens of weapons production sites and storage facilities in the heart of the Dahieh district, the organization’s governing stronghold. These sites, systematically concealed beneath civilian buildings,… pic.twitter.com/V06dNhjNRZ &mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) November 12, 2024 In one example cited by the IDF, which it noted Israel had revealed at the United Nations General Assembly in 2020, a primary site was established in the heart of the Choueifat neighborhood beneath a complex of five residential buildings housing around 50 families, 85 meters from a school. 'This site was intended to produce various weapon components, including long-range precision missiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel. These missiles are a central element of Hezbollah’s precision missile project, funded by Iran,' the IDF said. The IDF also used the 2020 Beirut Port blast as an example of how Hezbollah places civilians in Beirut in mortal danger. In the Aug. 4 event, 2,750 tons of ammunition nitrate, a component used in Hezbollah’s weapon production process, exploded, causing massive destruction, killing 190 civilians and wounding thousands more. Reminder 1: we operate according to precise intelligence. Reminder 2: we exposed this missile production site 5 years ago, and warned the approx. 50 families living there to move away from the area. Today we can say this site has been dismantled. &mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) November 12, 2024 Overnight Tuesday, the Israeli Air Force continued the strikes on Hezbollah weapons storage facilities and command centers in the Dahieh area, and on Wednesday morning the IDF issued evacuation orders for Lebanese civilians near six buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs. The IDF stressed that many steps were taken before the strikes to minimize harm to the civilian population, including the issuing of advance warnings. מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר, בהכוונת אגף המודיעין תקפו במהלך הלילה מחסני אמצעי לחימה ומפקדות של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה במרחב הדאחייה שבביירות >> pic.twitter.com/09WhABaGab &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 13, 2024 IDF hits launchers used in Tuesday’s deadly attacks The IDF said on Wednesday morning that it struck the Hezbollah launchers in Lebanon used to fire 55 projectiles into Israel on Tuesday, one of which killed two people in the northern Israel city of Nahariya.

In addition, two people in their 30s sustained light wounds from rocket shrapnel in Kibbutz Kabri in the Western Galilee. Both victims were evacuated to Nahariya’s Galilee Medical Center for treatment. According to the IDF, approximately 10 rockets were fired from Lebanon, only some of which were intercepted. Earlier on Tuesday, a Hezbollah drone exploded in the yard of a kindergarten in the Haifa suburb of Nesher. There were no injuries reported and the impact caused minor damage. Israel’s Channel 12 News reported that despite no sirens sounding in Nesher, teachers decided to evacuate the children to a protected area, thereby saving their lives. Also on Tuesday, Hezbollah fired three ballistic missiles at central Israel, temporarily halting air traffic at Ben-Gurion International Airport. All three missiles were intercepted. Overnight Tuesday and on Wednesday morning, three drones launched from Lebanon and Iraq were intercepted by Israel’s air defenses. On Wednesday afternoon, 20 rockets were fired from Lebanon at the Western and Upper Galilee, according to the IDF. Most of the projectiles were intercepted, with some impacts recorded. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Over the past 24 hours, the IAF struck over 120 Hezbollah and Hamas targets in Lebanon and in Gaza. Halevi to reserve fighters: ‘The IDF is working very hard’ IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi visited troops in Southern Lebanon for a situational assessment on Tuesday alongside commanding officers, telling the reserve forces that 'The IDF is working very hard—attacking in Beirut, in Dahieh, [deep in Lebanon], and in Syria.' הרמטכ״ל ללוחמי המילואים בדרום לבנון: ״צה״ל עובד חזק מאוד - תוקפים בביירות בדאחייה, בעומק ובסוריה״ pic.twitter.com/zQXe8dVtvU &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 12, 2024 Halevi emphasized that the Israeli attacks in Lebanon have taken 'significant command and combat capabilities' from Hezbollah. 'The IDF is simultaneously operating very strongly, we struck heavily against Hezbollah targets in Beirut, the Dahieh, and other locations,' the army chief said. 'We are conducting deep strikes and striking frequently in Syria and along the Syria-Lebanon border to prevent weapons transfers to Hezbollah. Clearing this area will provide the basic conditions to do things correctly in order to really ensure that the valley below is secure,' he said. Four Hezbollah commanders killed in recent IDF strikes The IDF reported Wednesday that four senior Hezbollah operatives, including three field commanders and the leader of the group’s anti-tank missile unit, were killed in recent Israeli strikes in Lebanon.

Nabulsi had been designated as the successor to Muhammad Khalil Alian, who was killed late last month in an Israeli strike on the village of Burj Qallawiyah in Southern Lebanon. Earlier, at the beginning of October, the IAF carried out an operation that eliminated Muhammad Musa Salah, Hezbollah’s commander in the Khiam area. Salah had directed attacks against Israel and was responsible for firing over 2,500 projectiles targeting the Golan Heights, Upper Galilee, Galilee panhandle, and IDF positions in Southern Lebanon. In additional precision strikes, the IDF also eliminated Hezbollah’s commander in the Ghajar area and Hajj Ali Yussef Salah, who served as the group’s commander in Tebnit. 'This further degrades Hezbollah’s capability to carry out terror attacks from southern Lebanon against Israeli civilians on the northern border,' the IDF said. 'The IDF will continue to operate to thwart any danger or threat against the State of Israel.'

Report: Trump’s victory has forced Iran to delay attack on Israel	Iranian officials say Tehran has shelved plans to attack Israel in response for October 26th strikes, after Trump defeated Kamala Harris in this month's election. By World Israel News Staff The Iranian government has decided to postpone its planned attack on Israel following former President and President-elect Donald Trump's election in the November 5th vote, according to a report Wednesday afternoon. Citing multiple Iranian sources, Sky News Arabia reported that Tehran has backed off its plans for a major strike on Israel for the time being. Iranian officials had dubbed the planned attack 'Operation True Promise 3,' as it would mark the third major direct attack by Iran on Israel this year. On April 13th, Iran launched roughly 120 cruise and ballistic missiles towards Israel, along with a number of suicide drones. Iran again struck Israel on October 1st, launching some 180 ballistic missiles. Israel retaliated on October 26th, striking Iran's missile defense network with over 100 warplanes. Following Israel's retaliatory strike, Brig. Gen. Ali Mohammed Naeini, spokesman for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, vowed that Iran would respond to what he dubbed the 'new evil act.' 'The response to the recent Zionist aggression against Iran will be inevitable, decisive and beyond the enemy's awareness,' Naeini said. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also declared publicly that his country would respond 'harshly' for the October 26th retaliatory strikes, suggesting that both the U.S. and Israel would be targeted 'for what they are doing against Iran and the axis of resistance.' Now, however, Iranian sources claimed that Tehran has 'postponed the implementation of Operation True Promise 3 against Israel after Trump's victory.' The sources added that the retaliation was shelved but not permanently nixed, saying that it would be put back on the table after Tehran has an opportunity to engage with the incoming administration. 'The Iranian response against Israel is postponed until negotiations with President Trump begin.'

Islamic Jihad releases new footage of Israeli captive	Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group releases third psychological warfare video featuring 29-year-old captive Alexander Sasha Trufanov. By World Israel News Staff The Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group has released a new video featuring hostage Alexander Sasha Trufanov, marking the third such clip of him since his abduction. The timing of the video’s recording remains unclear, though Trufanov identifies himself as 28 years old in the footage. Notably, the release comes just two days after Trufanov turned 29, having now spent two birthdays in captivity. Trufanov, an engineer at Annapurna Labs, an Israeli microelectronics firm owned by Amazon, was taken hostage alongside three family members — his grandmother Irena Tati, mother Yelena (Lena) Trufanova, and girlfriend Sapir Cohen — during the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz. Trufanov's father was murdered during the invasion. While Tati and Trufanova were released on November 29th as a gesture to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Cohen was freed the next day during a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Trufanov remains in captivity. The video’s release highlights what Israeli authorities describe as psychological warfare, a tactic frequently employed by terror groups. Before his abduction, Trufanov had recently moved with Cohen to an apartment in Ramat Gan, leaving his friends unaware he was visiting family in the Gaza border community at the time of the massacre. Hamas politburo deputy chief Mousa Abu Marzouk has previously indicated that Trufanov and another hostage with Russian citizenship, Maxim Herkin, would be prioritized for release in a future deal, though no concrete timeline has been provided. Following the release of the video Wednesday, Trufanov's mother, Yelena, said she was 'relieved' to see her son alive, while lamenting that she is 'very worried to hear what he is saying. I urge that every effort be made to secure his immediate release and that of all other hostages. They have no time left.'

US won’t impose arms embargo on Israel over Gaza aid	Biden administration says Israel only partially in compliance with demands to expand entry of Gaza aid and end isolation of northern Gaza, but indicates no arms embargo will be imposed. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The deadline imposed by the Biden administration on Israel to comply with its demands to expand the entry of aid to the Gaza Strip and to reduce the use of mass evacuation orders in the coastal enclave expired Wednesday, with the White House appearing to back down from a possible confrontation with Jerusalem over American weapons sales. On October 13th, senior American officials penned a memorandum to Israeli leaders setting out an ultimatum with a 30-day deadline, insisting that Jerusalem take steps to increase the flow of aid to the Gaza Strip, to reduce the use of mass evacuation orders in Gaza, and to reduce the isolation of the northern Gaza Strip, where IDF forces are currently operating to crush a Hamas insurgency. On Tuesday, State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said that while Israel had not, in the administration's determination, fulfilled all 15 of the demands issued in the October 13th memo, the U.S. has not 'made an assessment that there that the Israelis are in violation of US law.' Previously, the Biden administration had intimated that failure by Israel to comply with the memo would result in restrictions on arms transfers. Patel cited a number of steps taken by the Israeli government since October 13th to conform with the Biden administration's demands. 'Over the past 30 days, Israel has taken a number of steps to address the measures laid out in the letter that Secretaries Blinken and Austin sent earlier in October,' Patel said. 'We continue to be in discussion with our partners in Israel about these steps that they have taken, which they took as a result of U.S. intervention, as well as additional steps that we feel that still need to be taken.' 'Specifically, we have seen the reopening of the Erez crossing. We have seen a new crossing at Kissufim open. As it relates to the Jordanian armed forces corridor, we have seen a waivement of certain customs requirement that humanitarian organizations had previously said was an obstacle.' 'We’ve also seen the expansion of the Mawasi humanitarian zone, and we have seen the institution of periodic operational pauses.' Patel acknowledged that the flow of aid into Gaza remains below the 350-truck per day goal set by the Biden administration, though the rate has increased since the memo, rising from an average of 37 trucks per day to 45.

After Iranian assassination attempt, Netanyahu relocates to bunke...	The move was made after a UAV hit his home in Caesarea last month. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been working in a bunker in the basement of his office in Jerusalem since his home in Caesarea was hit by a UAV last month, Channel 12 reported Sunday. Although he and his family weren’t in the house at the time and the building only suffered minor exterior damage from the Hezbollah-sent drone, security around the prime minister was tightened due to the obvious threat. Usually, Netanyahu works with his senior aides in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) in what is known as the 'aquarium' due to its glass walls. It is a sterile area on an upper floor in the government’s Jerusalem building complex. Cabinet meetings that usually took place in the PMO were also moved to the basement’s fortified room. As this is smaller than the office, the ministers were told that they could not bring their usual aides along anymore. The Shin Bet internal security agency also recommended that he should not stay in fixed locations. This may be another reason behind Netanyahu’s lawyers’ request to the court Tuesday that his corruption trials be postponed for two and a half months. The defense is supposed to begin its counterattack on December 2nd, and Netanyahu is going to need to attend court. Doing so on a known basis a few times a week could make planning an attack on him much easier. The public reasons given by the lawyers include Netanyahu’s need for more time prepare his defense due to the long hours he spends on the ongoing war – and that the court building has no safe room or bomb shelter. The State Attorney’s Office has objected to the request, as the cases have dragged on since 2020 and 'Beginning the case for the defense at the set time is necessary in order to protect the public interest, the fairness of the process, and the fundamental principle that everyone is equal before the law.' Netanyahu reportedly cited the security issue outright when discussing recently the idea of postponing his son Avner’s wedding, which was supposed to take place on November 26th. Kan News reported that he had told confidantes that he was worried about the safety of attendees at the festivities that were to be held in Tel Aviv. 'For missiles, we have good detection and interception systems,' he reportedly said, in seeming contrast to the UAVs Hezbollah has launched at Israel. The Iranian terror proxy has been firing many more drones, and at at longer ranges, over recent months than at the beginning of the war. Their more erratic flight path makes them more difficult to track and several have slipped through the IDF’s aerial defenses, killing and injuring dozens of civilians and soldiers, including twelve Druze children in the Golan Heights town of Majdal Shams in one July attack alone. Avner Netanyahu and his partner, Amit Yardeni, who have been together for the last two years, decided to push off their nuptials until next summer.

America’s next ambassador to Israel backs annexation of Judea and...	Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee vows to do 'anything' he can to further the goal of applying Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee appeared to endorse Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to apply sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria, after he tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel. On Tuesday, Trump announced his selection of Huckabee, who is expected to be formally nominated shortly after Trump takes office on January 20th. Huckabee's nomination will then be brought before the Senate, which under the incoming Republican majority is expected to quickly confirm the appointment. A day later, Israel's Galey Tzahal radio channel aired an interview with Huckabee in which the former governor and Fox News host responded to the news of his selection as ambassador. 'I am still in a bit of a shock,' Huckabee said. 'This is a wonderful appointment. I am incredibly honored that the President asked me to serve in this capacity. There are still so many things that I am not yet aware of in terms of timing, but on a personal level, this is a wonderful opportunity to serve my country.' 'I visited Israel in 1973, almost 53 years ago and since then I have made dozens of trips to the country. I have taken tens of thousands of Americans to visit Israel and it has been an amazing honor.' Huckabee added that while as ambassador he does not have discretion regarding American policy vis-a-vis Israel, he would 'anything' he can to help promote efforts to extend Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. 'I have been a frequent visitor to Judea and Samaria and I believe that there is a chance of applying Israeli sovereignty to the region,' Huckabee said. 'I also very much believe that the people of Israel deserve a secure and safe country and I will do anything I can that will help and accommodate this goal.' 'Of course, I will not be the one to make the policy, but I will carry out the president’s policy. But there has never been a U.S. president who has been more helpful in ensuring the sovereignty of Israel. No one has done more for Israel, including recognition of the Golan Heights, than President Trump.' A long-time supporter of Israel and the settlement movement in Judea and Samaria, Huckabee has in the past rejected the two-state solution and seemingly endorsed the voluntary transfer of Palestinian Arabs out of the area. In February 2011, Huckabee suggested that Palestinian Arabs be resettled in 'a territory that [is] in the hands of Muslims, in the hands of Arabs.' According to a report by Kan Reshet Bet, Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu has privately reassured senior government ministers that he will resume efforts to apply Israeli sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria. The plans were first drawn up in 2019, but shelved in 2020 as part of the Abraham Accords.

Trump picks Fox host, Army vet Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defe...	Hegseth’s selection was unexpected, even among those close to Trump’s inner circle. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Donald Trump has tapped Army combat veteran and Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his next defense secretary, the president-elect announced Tuesday. Hegseth, who earned two bronze stars from combat tours, served as a platoon leader at the Guantanamo Bay naval facility and fought in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He is a longtime Trump stalwart who was once tipped to run the Veterans Affairs Department during the president’s first term in office. Hegseth’s selection was unexpected, even among those close to Trump’s inner circle. Prominent Republican foreign policy hawks—such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo—were initially named as potential candidates, along with former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a favorite among isolationists. 'Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First,' Trump said in a statement announcing his pick. 'With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice—Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down.' Hegseth is a Princeton University graduate who also holds a graduate degree from Harvard University. He is known for his appearances on the Fox News channel over the past decade and hosts the network’s Fox & Friends Weekend. It is unclear how the Senate, which will need to confirm Hegseth once its new Republican majority is sworn in, will receive his surprise nomination. Trump also announced on Tuesday evening that former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe will serve as the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In a third statement, he tapped Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a 'Department of Government Efficiency.'

Israeli doctoral student uncovers the resilience of Gaza border c...	Surprisingly, she found that despite the widespread trauma, a significant level of community resilience emerged, albeit with varying levels of coping based on factors such as age, gender, and personal experience. By Pesach Benson, TPS For doctoral student Nitzan Eilon, the Hamas attacks of October 7 hit close to home — terrorists were caught in her garden at Moshav Netiv Ha’asara. She was saved thanks to quick action by the community’s civilian security squad. But 20 moshav residents were killed that day and for many of Eilon’s neighbors, the trauma still lingers. Eilon, a doctoral student in the Conflict Management and Resolution program at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, found herself compelled to research the long-term effects of the attacks on her neighbors, seeking to understand how the residents of the western Negev have been coping. 'The unique focus of the current research is how one’s personality style which begins to develop in infancy, combined with a sense of coherence, trust in the army and community resilience, help people cope and begin to recover from the events of October 7,' Eilon said. 'Alongside the findings of the sense of coherence and the high community resilience that we discovered, the fact that we are still in the midst of a war, the hostages have not yet returned and there are many more evacuees, it is imperative to continue to examine the struggle in its various stages,' she added. As part of her doctoral research, Eilon surveyed approximately 600 residents from the western Negev communities, ages 18-91, to assess how they were managing the emotional stress. Guided by Prof. Orna Braun-Lewensohn, Eilon explored stress reactions and the resilience of residents in the aftermath of the attack. Surprisingly, she found that despite the widespread trauma, a significant level of community resilience emerged, albeit with varying levels of coping based on factors such as age, gender, and personal experience. One key finding was the relatively high levels of community resilience reported across the sample. On a scale measuring resilience, the average score was 3.54 out of 7, indicating that most residents showed an ability to adapt and endure despite the ongoing crisis. Additionally, a sense of coherence — defined as the belief that life has meaning and can be understood — was reported to be similarly strong, with an average score of 4.44 out of 7. However, trust in the Israeli army was lower, with an average score of just 2.33 out of 5, suggesting a sense of uncertainty among the population regarding their security. According to the survey, 83% of respondents were at home on October 7, and nearly half (45%) experienced the infiltration of terrorists firsthand. Furthermore, 52% had close friends or family members who were killed, kidnapped, or wounded during the attack. Despite this, the resilience of the community as a whole was notable, with respondents often citing the importance of social support networks, the sense of unity, and shared identity as key factors in their ability to cope. Eilon’s research also examined differences between the founding members of the communities — many of whom were the first generation to settle in these areas — and their younger counterparts. While resilience levels were high across all groups, founders of the settlements exhibited a distinctively higher level of resilience compared to younger residents. The study also revealed significant differences in stress responses between different age groups. Younger residents, particularly those between the ages of 18-30, experienced the highest levels of anxiety and distress. In contrast, older adults, particularly those aged 61 and above, reported lower levels of psychological distress, suggesting that younger individuals may have fewer coping mechanisms in place. Gender differences were also apparent in the study’s findings. Women reported higher levels of psychological distress and lower quality of life compared to men. Women’s distress scores averaged 2.38, compared to 1.99 for men. Additionally, women were more likely to rely on emotional coping strategies, such as seeking help from others and receiving emotional support. These strategies, while important, also suggested that women were more emotionally affected by the attacks. Eilon and Braun-Lewensohn emphasize that the struggle is far from over. With many challenges still ahead, including the ongoing war and the return of hostages, it is critical to continue monitoring the psychological impact of the conflict and provide support to all affected groups. 'We must ensure that all population groups manage to cope, recover, and grow anew,' said Braun-Lewensohn. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

‘Weakens its image’: Experts explain why Hezbollah stopped announ...	Hezbollah may want to cover up such losses as it weakens its image as Iran’s terror proxy crown jewel of resistance,' Jason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) stated. By Jack Elbaum, The Algemeiner Since the war between Israel and Hezbollah began to escalate this September, the Iran-backed Lebanese terrorist organization has stopped announcing its casualties through public relations channels. Experts tell The Algemeiner this is likely because of the breakdown of Hezbollah’s command and control structure or in order to help control narratives around the conflict. Rather than death notices being published by Hezbollah itself — as was the case from October 2023 to September 2024 — terrorist deaths have mainly been reported by open intelligence sources based on funeral notices and social media posts. Israeli assessments suggest that over 2,000 Hezbollah fighters have been killed since October 2023, said Jason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI). This number includes upwards of 1,000 terrorists killed since the situation in northern Israel, which borders Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Lebanon, began to escalate just under two months ago. Brodsky’s approximate number is somewhat supported by at least one open-source intelligence gatherer who has identified almost 1,500 Hezbollah casualties as of Nov. 11, 2024, primarily using funeral notices found on local social media channels. This includes about 900 deaths since September. Experts estimate the number of Hezbollah fighters wounded to be three or four times higher than the death count, including the thousands of Hezbollah fighters injured in Israel’s pager attack in September, when communications devices used by the terrorists exploded simultaneously across Lebanon. Hezbollah is widely considered to have a pre-war fighting force of around 20,000-25,000 militiamen working full-time, with tens of thousands more in the reserves. Hezbollah has good reason, experts say, to hide its true casualty numbers as the terrorist organization appears to still be suffering from command-and-control disruptions due to Israeli military pressure. As a result, Hezbollah has been forced to use guerilla tactics rather than operating as a coherent military force. While Israel has suffered almost 100 civilian and military casualties in its offensive against Hezbollah, along with relentless rocket fire and drone attacks from the Islamist organization on the country’s north — and at times, in the heart of Tel Aviv — the level of damage to Israel’s home front and critical infrastructure has been far less than expected. Max Abrahms, professor of international relations at Northeastern University, explained that terrorist groups such as Hezbollah often lie. 'Sometimes they conceal information about their own losses,' he said. 'The reason why they do that,' Abrahms continued, 'is because they want to create the perception that they’re more successful than they really are. And terrorist groups very often have to do that because, in general, terrorist groups are losers.' Over the past few months, Israel has decimated the leadership of Hezbollah, with almost its entire top level of command being killed — including Hassan Nasrallah, its longtime leader. Israel has long been worried that a war with Hezbollah could result in massive losses for the Jewish state, as the Lebanese terror group reportedly had more than 120,000 rockets over various ranges in its arsenal, primarily sponsored by Iran. Israeli estimates suggest Hezbollah now retains only 20 percent of its missile arsenal and that Israel has eliminated 70 percent of its drone arsenal, according to Brodsky. 'Hezbollah may want to cover up such losses as it weakens its image as Iran’s terror proxy crown jewel of resistance,' Brodsky added. Elliott Abrams, senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former White House deputy national security adviser, agreed. 'The usual terrorist pattern is to exaggerate the number of civilian casualties and deny the number of terrorists killed,' he said. 'This is done to mask the impact of Israeli strikes on armed Hezbollah men and keep up Hezbollah morale.' After Israel’s pager attack, air and ground campaign, and targeted assassinations of Hezbollah leaders, the group is struggling to keep up its rocket fire and military operations against Israel. At the same time, Hezbollah may still be able to manufacture weapons. 'Hezbollah may still have capacity to manufacture missiles and drones in Lebanon proper, and that’s not to mention ongoing Iranian attempts to ship weapons and supplies,' Abrams said. 'But, those corridors have become more restricted with Israel’s operations.'

Trump nominates Jewish businessman, close friend as special Middl...	Steve will be an unrelenting voice for peace, and make us all proud,' said Donald Trump. By JNS President-elect Donald Trump named Steven Witkoff, a longtime close friend and Jewish businessman, whom he called a 'highly respected leader in business and philanthropy,' as his special Middle East envoy. 'Another great call. Steve is a brilliant businessman and a lover of Israel who will receive a warm welcome throughout the halls of power within the Middle East,' wrote David Friedman, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel. Witkoff, who is chairman and CEO of an eponymous firm that he founded in 1997, 'has made every project and community he has been involved with stronger and more prosperous,' Trump stated. 'Steve will be an unrelenting voice for peace, and make us all proud.' The businessman 'has leveraged his extensive real estate expertise to successfully lead the financing, repositioning and construction of over 70 properties in major business districts in the U.S. as well as abroad and with offices in New York, Los Angeles and Miami,' the president-elect added. He noted that Witkoff has also practiced law in addition to working in real estate and has served on the Real Estate Board of New York’s executive committee and the board of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation. He also chairs the real estate advisory board of the Miami Business School, is a trustee at Hofstra University and has been a trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Witkoff, who was born in the Bronx, has been a major donor to Trump’s political action groups and was, as a lawyer, among Trump’s early clients. A 1999 profile in the Observer referred to Witkoff as 'a spare, knifelike man who keeps a copy of the book Tough Jews on his desk and used to carry a gun while collecting rents uptown.' 'President-elect Trump has nominated Gov. Huckabee as ambassador to Israel. American Jewish Committee looks forward to working with Gov. Huckabee and newly appointed special envoy for the Middle East Steven Witkoff to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship, bolster Israel-diaspora relations, and promote strong connections between American Jewry and Israel,' stated Ted Deutch, CEO of the AJC.

Mossad warns of Thailand terror plots targeting Israeli tourists	Iran and its proxies have intensified their efforts to harm Israeli and Jewish targets around the world,' said the Mossad in a statement. By World Israel News Staff Israel's Mossad intelligence agency warned Israeli tourists in Thailand to avoid a world-famous outdoor party this weekend, saying that the event may be targeted by terrorists attempting to murder Israelis. The Mossad confirmation of an immediate, credible threat comes after Thai police urged Israelis not to attend the November 15th Full Moon Party on the island of Koh Phangan, a popular destination for Israeli tourists. In 'recent months, Israeli security services in cooperation with Thai security have acted to thwart several incidents' in the country, read a joint statement between the Mossad and National Security Council (NSC). 'Since October 7 and the war [in Gaza], Iran and its proxies have intensified their efforts to harm Israeli and Jewish targets around the world,' the statement said. Israel's NSC issued a travel advisory, telling tourists to avoid southern Thailand and for those already in the country to avoid gatherings with large numbers of Israelis, Jewish centers such as Chabad houses, and to hide external symbols of their Jewish and Israeli identity. 'From my experience, Israelis are not easily rattled,' Erez Roth, a travel agent based on the Thai island of Ko Samui, told Ynet. 'But maybe this year, certainly after the attacks in Amsterdam, Israelis should avoid crowded gatherings.' The warning comes as anti-Israel sentiment has peaked across the world, with a number of high-profile violent incidents and thwarted terror plots focused on Israeli tourists. In late October, Israel warned its citizens traveling in Sri Lanka to hunker down in their hotels until they could leave the country, citing an imminent terror threat. Last week, Muslim gangs in Amsterdam attacked Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer fans who had traveled to the city, leaving five hospitalized. Israeli authorities have also urged Israelis to avoid the upcoming soccer match between the French and Israeli national teams, which will be held in France.

‘Don’t lose hope, fight the regime’ – Netanyahu to Iranians	Netanyahu used the Farsi phrase 'zan, zandegi, azadi' (women, life, freedom) - a common refrain during the demonstrations. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the Iranian people to overthrow the Islamic Regime in an English-language statement video on Tuesday evening. 'Yet there’s one thing Khamenei’s regime fears more than Israel. You know what it is? It’s you — the people of Iran. That’s why they spend so much time and money trying to crush your hopes and curb your dreams,' Netanyahu said, referencing protests to overthrow the Islamic government that were brutally suppressed by Iranian authorities. While speaking, Netanyahu used the Farsi phrase 'zan, zandegi, azadi' (women, life, freedom) - a common refrain during the demonstrations. 'The regime wants to destroy your future as they seek to destroy our state. Well, we won’t let that happen. I have no doubt that one day in a free Iran, Israelis and Iranians will build together a future of prosperity and peace,' he said. A special message from me to the Iranian people: there’s one thing Khamenei’s regime fears more than Israel. It’s you — the people of Iran. Don’t lose hope. پیام ویژه‌ای از من برای مردم ایران: یک چیز هست که رژیم خامنه‌ای بیش از اسرائیل از آن می‌ترسد. آن شما هستید — مردم ایران.… pic.twitter.com/iADxSjNXCs &mdash; Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) November 12, 2024 '‎‏That is the future Israel deserves. That is the future Iran deserves. Together, let us turn this beautiful dream into a reality.' Netanyahu said that Iran's October 1st attack on Israel had caused 'marginal damage' to the Jewish State, but cost Tehran billions of dollars. The premier noted that those funds could have been spent on infrastructure improvements, education, healthcare, and other initiatives that would have benefited the Iranian people. Netanyahu hinted that another attack by Iran against Israel would result in a counter-attack that would cost Tehran dearly, in what may be a reference to Israel potentially striking Iranian oil assets. Iran's rulers 'obsess about destroying Israel, rather than about building Iran. What a shame,' Netanyahu said. 'Another attack on Israel would simply cripple Iran’s economy. It would rob you of many more billions of dollars.' He stressed that Iran adopting a democratic, non-Islamic form of government is possible. ‎‏'Imagine how your children’s lives would look if billions of dollars were invested in them instead of being wasted on wars that can’t be won. They would receive world-class education. You would receive beautiful roads. Advanced hospitals. Clean water,' Netanyahu said. 'You know, Israel has the world’s most advanced desalination system and we’d be happy to help rebuild Iran’s collapsing water infrastructure. These and so many other things are the things that you could have.'

President-elect Trump names Mike Huckabee as US ambassador to Isr...	Huckabee 'loves Israel and the people of Israel and likewise, the people of Israel love him,' Trump declared. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump announced that the 'great public servant, governor, and leader in faith for many years' and 'highly respected' Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, will be the U.S. ambassador to Israel during the next administration. Huckabee 'loves Israel and the people of Israel and likewise, the people of Israel love him,' Trump stated. 'Mike will work tirelessly to bring about peace in the Middle East.' A Southern Baptist pastor and governor for more than a decade, Huckabee sought the Republican nomination for president in 2008 and 2016. A staunch supporter of the Jewish state on biblical beliefs, the former governor has visited Israel many times and led thousands of U.S. Christians on solidarity tours over the past half-century. His first trip to Israel right out of high school was just before the 1973 Yom Kippur war. Huckabee backed the relocation of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and has worked to fight attempts by the BDS movement to isolate Israel. In the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist massacre in southern Israeli towns, Huckabee led evangelical leaders on a visit to the hard-hit communities along the border with the Gaza Strip. 'After 50 years of coming here, nothing has prepared me for this visit,' he said after walking through the charred remains of a border kibbutz. He told JNS at the time that the ignorance so many Americans display about the war was a searing indictment of the educational system, which indoctrinates college students with a warped worldview. In August 2018, Huckabee laid a ceremonial brick at the Israeli city of Efrat in Judea and said he might one day buy a 'holiday home' there. 'If President Trump could be here today, he’d be a very happy man,' he stated at the time, standing in front of a red sign that said 'Build Israel Great Again.' The Republican Jewish Coalition is 'thrilled' with the nomination. 'As a man of deep faith, we know Gov. Huckabee’s abounding love of Israel and its people is second to none,' the RJC said. 'As the Jewish state continues to fight an existential war for survival against Iran and its terrorist proxies, Gov. Huckabee will represent America’s ironclad commitment to Israel’s security with distinction.' David Friedman, who served as the U.S. envoy to Israel during Trump’s first presidency and was reportedly under consideration for the role again, stated that Huckabee is 'a dear friend and he will have my full support. 'Congrats Mike on getting the best job in the world,' Friedman wrote. 'It speaks volumes to the importance and priority that President Trump places on the U.S.-Israel relationship that he selected his ambassador to Israel within one week of his election,' Friedman added. 'The selection itself—Mike Huckabee is one of Israel’s greatest friends—tells us that the days of public daylight between the U.S. and Israel are about to end.'

Report: US leaked Saudi-Israel peace deal right before Hamas mass...	Sonnenfeld – who helped shape the original Abraham Accords under the Trump administration – described the official as a habitual over-sharer who acted out of arrogance rather than malice. By Jewish Breaking News The US National Security Council may have inadvertently provoked Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel through a diplomatic leak. In an interview on Iran International’s Eye for Iran podcast, academic Jeff Sonnenfeld revealed that a senior deputy to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan allegedly disclosed sensitive details about imminent Saudi-Israeli peace negotiations just days before the massacre. The leak reportedly occurred at a crucial moment when Saudi Arabia was poised to join the Abraham Accords, potentially transforming Middle Eastern geopolitics. According to Sonnenfeld, the unnamed official 'stuck a finger in the eye of Hamas' through his indiscreet revelations on October 5 or 6, prompting the terrorist group to act before the historic agreement could be finalized. While Sullivan’s office has firmly denied these allegations, Sonnenfeld – who helped shape the original Abraham Accords under the Trump administration – described the official as a habitual over-sharer who acted out of arrogance rather than malice. 'There is one deputy in there that, you name the crisis from the Middle East to Central Europe, this guy can’t stop talking. He’s beyond naive. It is his negligence and malpractice in office, but he’s rather full of himself and quite a dandy on top of that,' Sonnenfeld said. 'It would have been amazing, but by tempting fate like that, Hamas realized this was their last moment to strike.' During the interview, Sonnenfeld also praised President Joe Biden, who inherited the Abraham Accords from his predecessors, for not reversing it, and noted that the president privately acknowledged how close they had been to securing Saudi Arabia’s signature on the peace agreement. Sonnenfeld characterized the leak as 'an ill-timed irritant' that contributed to derailing one of the most significant diplomatic initiatives in recent Middle Eastern history, though he stopped short of directly attributing Hamas’s actions to the disclosure.

Kibbutz Nir Oz votes to rebuild following Oct. 7 destruction	In December, Israel’s Cabinet approved the outline for a strategic five years and up to 18 billion shekel plan to rehabilitate and develop the Gaza-adjacent region and its population. By JNS A majority of Kibbutz Nir Oz members voted on Monday to return to their destroyed homes and rebuild. The kibbutz was among the hardest hit communities during Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of southern Israel. One in four residents was either killed or kidnapped, including the Bibas family, mother Shiri, husband Yarden and their two children, Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 9 months old. In a letter to the government, the kibbutz members stressed their expectations for a large-scale and generous construction plan, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. In May, Israel Defense Forces Brig. Gen. Moshe Edri, the head of the government body overseeing the rehabilitation of the Gaza border region, said residents of Be’eri, Nir Oz and Kfar Aza would only be able to return home in two to three years. Edri said that residents of those communities would be set up in temporary housing until then. In December, Israel’s Cabinet approved the outline for a strategic multi-year plan to rehabilitate and develop the Gaza-adjacent region and its population. The plan comprises a broad budgetary framework for five years (2024-2028) of up to 18 billion shekels ($4.9 billion). Following the Oct. 7 massacre, all residents within seven kilometers of the Gaza border were evacuated. In January, the IDF Home Front Command allowed the partial return of some communities, including those of Kibbutz Bror Hayil, Kibbutz Dorot, Kibbutz Gvar’am, Moshav Mavki’im, Moshav Yakhini and Kibbutz Yad Mordechai.

Israel opens new Gaza border crossing to facilitate aid deliverie...	The outgoing Biden administration gave Israel a November 12 deadline to take specific measures to address northern Gaza’s humanitarian situation. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli authorities opened a new border crossing with Gaza on Tuesday to facilitate humanitarian aid deliveries. The crossing was opened 'in accordance with the directive of the political echelon, and as part of the effort and commitment to increase the amount and routes of aid to the Gaza Strip,' said Israel’s Coordinator for Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which coordinates civilian issues between the Israeli government, military, international community and the Palestinian Authority in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip. Trucks carrying food, water, medical equipment and equipment for shelters were inspected at the nearby Kerem Shalom Crossing before passing through Kissufim. The items are destined for southern and central Gaza. Meanwhile, hundreds of food and water packages were delivered to the northern Gaza areas of Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, where Hamas is trying to re-establish itself, Israeli authorities said on Tuesday. The deliveries come amid a dispute with Washington over aid. The outgoing Biden administration gave Israel a November 12 deadline to take specific measures to address northern Gaza’s humanitarian situation. Israeli officials are also trying to head off the United Nations from declaring a famine in northern Gaza. A declaration would trigger restrictions on American military aid to Israel, with other countries likely to follow suit. The declaration would be based on the findings of the UN’s Famine Review Committee, which assesses famine conditions. The FRC issued an emergency alert on Friday, claiming 'a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip,' and that 'immediate action, within days not weeks, is required.' The Israel Defense Forces rejected the alert, saying it was based on 'partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests.' An Israeli health emergency expert explained to The Press Service of Israel on Monday that there is no limit to the amount of aid could be delivered to the Strip. 'The amount of food trucks is determined by the amount that the donors send,' Dr. Dorit Nitzan, director of Ben Gurion University’s master’s program in Emergency Medicine, Preparedness and Response, told TPS-IL. 'The only thing that COGAT does is go through the items and don’t allow anything that has dual use.' Nitzan, who also held senior positions at the World Health Organization for 17 years, stressed that the number of trucks entering the Strip 'is determined entirely by the amount of donations provided for Gaza minus those that don’t pass the security check. Some 97% is allowed in, from the Israeli side.' She added that the safety of the checkpoint can also be a factor, but more often than not, the greater danger is Hamas and associated criminal groups hijacking the trucks. 'The big obstacles are the access and utilization of food from the Gazan side,' Nitzan said. Nitzan participated in a study by several Israeli institutions which concluded that Hamas posed the biggest threat to Gaza’s food security by hijacking food deliveries and firing rockets at border crossings where aid transfers take place. When Hamas slashed food prices in April, Gaza residents told The Press Service of Israel that the problem wasn’t a lack of food but a shortage of money for families to purchase it. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Israel’s AI sector outpaces global rivals, defying adversity	Israel’s number of active AI companies has jumped from 779 in 2014 to 2,170 in 2023, according to the study. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Israel’s AI sector is experiencing significant growth despite the ongoing war, positioning the country as a global leader in AI innovation, according to a report released on Tuesday. 'Israel stands at the forefront of global AI innovation, propelled by an extraordinary ecosystem of startups, academia, and multinational support,' said Avi Hasson, CEO of Startup Nation Central (SNC), which released the report. SNC is a Tel Aviv-based non-profit that promotes Israeli startups and innovation. According to the report’s findings, Israeli AI startups have demonstrated 173% growth since 2014, far outpacing the 12% increase in non-AI startups. While AI accounts for only 30% of Israel’s startups, they receive 47% of total company funding and representing 40% of the funding rounds in Israel. 'Since 2018, Israel’s AI investment share has typically been 3-4 times higher than Europe and the U.S.,' the report said. Although recent investments in U.S. AI companies have slightly narrowed the gap, the report also noted that key multinational tech giants, including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, and Apple, have strengthened the country’s startup ecosystem with significant investments in Israel. This strategic backing from global tech players supports Israel’s growing influence in AI, particularly in the areas of cybersecurity, healthcare, and agrifood. One of the most unique features of Israel’s AI ecosystem is its ability to attract early-stage funding, the report said. The report found that Israeli AI startups outperform their non-AI counterparts by at least 10% in securing initial capital. Furthermore, just 32% of AI startups remain unfunded within their first two years, compared to 50% of non-AI startups. As a result, Israel’s number of active AI companies has jumped from 779 in 2014 to 2,170 in 2023, according to the study. By the end of 2023, 'for every four American AI companies acquired by these MNCs, one Israeli AI company was also acquired,' the report noted. In healthcare, specifically, the report states that Israeli AI-driven startups are making strides in medical imaging, drug discovery, and clinical trials. In robotics, AI is revolutionizing industries such as agriculture, with Israeli AI robotics companies attracting 78% of total investment in the sector. Similarly, in climate tech, AI is being used to address climate challenges like weather modeling, sustainable agriculture, and wildfire prevention, the report said.

Hezbollah terror rockets kill two in Nahariya	Alerts were also activated in the central cities of Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, Petah Tikvah, as well as in the Sharon region. By JNS A rocket fired by Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorists scored a direct hit in the northern Israeli city of Nahariya on Tuesday afternoon, killing two people, the Magen David Adom emergency response group said. Air-raid sirens were also activated in Israel’s densely-populated central region, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed. 'Following the alerts that were activated in several areas in the center of the country, the Air Force intercepted three launches that crossed [into Israel] from Lebanon,' the military subsequently announced on X. Rocket alerts were activated in the central Israeli cities of Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, Petach Tikvah, as well as in major population centers in the Sharon region, including Herzliya, Ra’anana and Kfar Saba, sending millions running for shelter, according to the IDF Home Front Command.

Canadian city to permit ceremony honoring architect of October 7t...	City in Ontario refuses to shut down planned vigil in public square honoring Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief and architect of the October 7th massacres. By World Israel News Staff Pro-Hamas activists in Canada are planning to hold a public vigil honoring the architect of the October 7th massacres of Israelis, after municipal officials announced they would not interfere with the planned event. The event is set to be held on Tuesday, November 26th, at Mississauga City Hall’s Celebration Square in Mississauga, a city of 718,000 in the greater Toronto area. Flyers advertising the event were spotted last week, using the poppy flower symbol, established by the Royal Canadian Legion as a way to pay tribute to Canadian veterans, next to a photograph of the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar with the words 'Lest We Forget Our Heroes: Vigil For Resistance Leaders.' One advertisement said the event would commemorate '40 days after the Martyrdom of the leaders of Resistance fighting for Palestinian freedom.' No organization has been linked to the planned event, with only an email address, allheavens313@gmail.com, provided in the ads. Advertisement for a vigil honoring Yahya Sinwar in the Canadian city of Mississauga. (X) An anti-Israel activist, Faris Al Najim, released a video on November 11th, Remembrance Day, announcing the event in honor of Sinwar. The City of Mississauga has come under fire after city officials announced they would not be interfering with the planned event. 'The City of Mississauga has become aware of a vigil planned for November 26, 2024 to take place on Celebration Square,' city officials said in a statement. 'The City has not issued a permit for this group to host a vigil. It is not the City’s practice to issue permits for vigils as Celebration Square is a public space, usable by the community. Under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, groups have the right of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The City will not interfere with a peaceful vigil, as long as all laws and City by-laws are adhered to.' Social media users were quick to point out that the event constitutes promotion of Hamas, which Canada has banned as a terror organization. 'Everybody knows if the KKK were to hold a rally honouring the death of their leader, it would not be permitted to happen any more than if a bunch of Nazis decided to mark Hitler’s birthday,' columnist Joe Warmington wrote in the Toronto Sun. 'Hamas is not any different and is a banned terror group in Canada. Celebrating them is obscene — and hurtful to the families of their victims.' The Royal Canadian Legion has penned a cease-and-desist letter to the event’s organizers over their unauthorized use of the Legion’s poppy flower symbol. Mississauga Mayor Carolyn Parrish defended the city’s refusal to bar the event, saying any such steps would constitute 'preferential treatment.' 'That would be called censorship, preferential treatment, being judgmental — the stifling of freedom of speech which is something most Canadians value,' the mayor tweeted. On Monday night, Parrish appeared to deny that the event was actually going to be held, suggesting the ads were part of a hoax. 'Consulted a network of Muslim organizations, serious partners in many activities of our city - coaching sports, walkathons for Trillium Hospital and diabetes. I asked them to track down the anonymous notice for a vigil at City Hall. No organization exists. No vigil is planned,' the mayor tweeted.

Four soldiers killed by anti-tank missile in northern Gaza	The dead are First Sergeants Nave Yair Asulin, Ofir Eliyahu, Orr Katz, and Gary Lalhruaikima Zolat of the Kfir Brigade. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Four IDF soldiers of the Kfir Brigade’s Shimshon Brigade were killed in battle in the northern Gaza Strip, the IDF announced Tuesday. First Sergeants Nave Yair Asulin (21) of Carmit, Ofir Eliyahu (20) of Holon, Orr Katz (20) of Maaleh Adumim, and Gary Lalhruaikima Zolat (21) of Afula, died in an explosion in Jabalya while fighting Hamas terrorists. The initial army investigation of the incident is pointing to their being hit by an anti-tank missile fired by a Hamas terrorist into the building they had just entered. Asulin went to live in the Negev community of Carmit six years ago together with his parents and two brothers. According to his cousin Tair Yifrach’s testimonial to Ynet, he had always wanted to become a combat soldier, 'out of great love of the country.' Asulin 'only wanted to add good to the world,' she said, adding that after his IDF service, he 'dreamed of becoming an architect.' Eliyahu’s mother, Nadia, told the news site that her son had been injured, tearing his knee, during basic training in 2022 and had been determined to return to his combat unit. His father, Ami, said that 'Ofir and his friends only wanted to fight for the country&#8230;. It’s been a hard year. With every knock on the door we ran [to it] like madmen, and this time it happened, the awful knock came to us.' Eliyahu was an avid fan of the Hapoel Holon basketball team, and was planning to go on a post-service trip to the United States with his army buddies. Katz had twice already received a certificate of excellence from the IDF during his service. He served in the north, then Hebron, and only ten days ago entered Gaza for the first time, his sister-in-law, Noy, told Ynet. His first name, Orr, means 'light' in Hebrew, and she said that Katz 'was exactly like his name, wherever he was, people would feel the light.' He 'always helped anyone who asked,' she said, and the family was finding it impossible to internalize his loss. Zolat was a member of Bnei Menashe community, a group of crypto-Jews in India which claims descent from the ancient tribe of Manasseh. Most of the community converted to Judaism in coordination with Israel's Chief Rabbinate, but it is only being allowed to immigrate to Israel piecemeal. He came to Afula from Sderot with his family in 2014. His father, Dagan, described him as a person who 'loved his family and army friends, and to take care of animals. He wanted to be a combat soldier.' The local HaEmek Mynet site reported that he 'loved his army service and protecting the State and the Jewish people.' Zolat is survived by his parents and three siblings. A fifth soldier, Maj. (res.) Itamar Levin Fridman, 34, a member of the elite anti-terror the LOTAR Eilat unit, was killed Monday in a separate battle in Jabalya, also by an anti-tank missile. The IDF entered the Gazan town in October for the fourth time since the beginning of the war last year to clear it out once again of Hamas forces. It was labelled the 'most significant center of gravity' for the terrorist organization in the northern part of the Strip and the army is determined to break it once and for all. To do so, the army set up humanitarian corridors to enable the civilian residents to leave, which some 60,000 did despite the attempts of Hamas to force them to stay so they could be used as human shields. The death toll from the ground invasion of Gaza now stands at 375 IDF soldiers.

‘Miracle’ – Hezbollah drone hits kindergarten, no children hurt	The drone hit exactly where we had been,' says kindergarten teacher. By World Israel News Staff An explosive drone launched by the Hezbollah terror group struck a Haifa-area kindergarten on Tuesday morning, causing damage to the property but no injuries to children or staff. Footage from the scene circulating on social media showed damage to the facility’s outdoor play area, the building itself, and that the kindergarten’s windows had been shattered by the blast. 'We had a miracle of miracles,' Sarah Yasour, a teacher at the preschool, told Hebrew-language news outlets. Yasour said that she had been in the outdoor play area with the children shortly before the explosive drone impacted. She noted that no alarms had sounded in Nesher, a community on the outskirts of Haifa where the kindergarten is located. But, Yasour noted, she and other staffers heard sirens coming from nearby areas and decided to move the children into the facility’s bomb shelter as a precaution. 'We heard a very distant siren… and said ‘alright let’s go inside,’' Yasour recounted. Just a few seconds after all the children were in the shelter, 'we suddenly heard a huge noise and understood it must be close,' she said. 'Only when we got out did we realize the scale of the miracle. [The drone] hit exactly where we had been.' While Israel's Iron Dome intercepts the vast majority of projectiles fired from Lebanon, explosive drones have proved to be a challenge for air defense system. Because drones fly at a low altitude - literally under the radar - they aren't always detected by Israel's air defenses. In October, an explosive drone launched by Hezbollah struck Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. Netanyahu's son recently postponed his upcoming wedding, due to concerns that the event will be targeted by explosive drones.

‘No ceasefire in Lebanon until victory,’ Israel’s new defense chi...	Israel's new defense minister vows to continue war against Hezbollah 'without ceasefire and without pause' until terror group forced back north of Litani River and northern Israeli towns secured. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's new defense chief vowed Tuesday to continue the ground operation against the Iranian backed terrorist group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon until the IDF achieves victory and secures all of Israel's goals in the current conflict. Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud), who was tapped by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week to replace Yoav Gallant (Likud), held his first meeting with the IDF General Staff on Monday, discussing the ongoing conflict with Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah. 'In my first meeting today with the IDF General Staff Forum,' Katz tweeted Monday, 'I emphasized: Iran is more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities. We have the opportunity to achieve our most important goal – to thwart and eliminate the existential threat to the State of Israel.' In a follow-up post Tuesday morning, Katz revealed that during Monday's meeting with IDF top brass he had emphasized that Israel will continue its military pressure on Hezbollah until the terror group's infrastructure in southern Lebanon is dismantled, the terror group is pushed away from the Israeli border, and northern Israeli towns are secured. 'The warning and powerful activity carried out by the IDF and the security agencies against Hezbollah and the elimination of Nasrallah are a picture of victory and the offensive activity should be continued, in order to increase and worsen Hezbollah's capabilities and realize the fruits of victory,' Katz said. In stark contrast to a recent report which claimed that the IDF's Northern Command had stated that the military had achieved its goals in Lebanon and that the time is ripe for a diplomatic solution, Katz vowed 'no ceasefire' and 'no respite' in the war until Israel has achieved all of its war aims. 'In Lebanon there will be no ceasefire and there will be no respite. We will continue to hit Hezbollah with full force until the goals of the war are achieved.' 'Israel will not agree to any arrangement that does not guarantee Israel's right to enforce and prevent terrorism on its own, and meeting the goals of the war in Lebanon, disarming Hezbollah and withdrawing them beyond the Litani River and returning the residents of the north safely to their homes.'

Trump may not back Israeli annexation plan, warn aides	Former Trump administration officials warn Israel that the president-elect may not back plans to apply sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, adding President Trump had only backed such a move in 2020 as part of his larger peace plan. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President and President-elect Donald Trump may not back plans by the Netanyahu government to extend Israeli sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria, multiple former Trump administration officials warned Israeli government ministers. According to a report Tuesday morning by The Times of Israel which cited three separate sources, at least two former Trump aides told Israeli ministers recently not to assume that Trump will support their plans to apply Israeli sovereignty over part or all of Judea and Samaria after he takes office on January 20th. The message was reportedly conveyed in multiple conversations over the last few months, with the latest having taken place last week. On the other hand, the former Trump officials did not say the incoming president would oppose such steps, but merely advised Israeli leaders not to view his support as a 'foregone conclusion.' One former Trump aide emphasized that the president-elect would not support an Israeli plan to extend sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria 'in a vacuum,' noting that Trump’s willingness in 2020 to back Israeli annexation plans was closely tied to Jerusalem’s acceptance of his Deal of the Century peace plan. 'If it happens, it will have to be part of a process,' the official was quoted as saying. In 2020, ahead of the presidential election, Israel and the United States vowed to the United Arab Emirates as part of the Abraham Accords that Jerusalem would not move forward with applying sovereignty in Judea and Samaria for an extended period of time. While the duration of that prohibition was never publicized, last year, the United Arab Emirates Ambassador to the United States, Yousef al-Otaiba, claimed at a Washington conference that Israel is bound only until the end of 2024 – a claim confirmed by multiple sources who spoke with The Times of Israel. On Tuesday, Kan Reshet Bet reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has privately reassured senior government ministers that he plans on putting his 2019 annexation plans back on the agenda. Ministers, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) have both publicly called on the government to move forward with the sovereignty plans once Trump enters office.

Israeli lawmaker who backed anti-Israel genocide charges banned f...	The extreme leftist MK had joined S. Africa in charging Israel at the International Court of Justice with attempted genocide in Gaza. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Extreme leftist Ofer Cassif was banned from Knesset for six months Monday by the body’s Ethics Committee for his unrelenting, public vilification of Israel and the IDF since the Israel-Hamas war began thirteen months ago. The committee, consisting of two legislators each from the coalition and Opposition, unanimously decided that the MK’s actions and words went beyond what could be tolerated as free speech, especially during wartime. The only Jew on the Arab Hadash-Ta’al list was 'encouraging bloodshed against IDF soldiers and the State of Israel, while undermining the state’s ability to deal' with charges against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), it said in its decision. Cassif had joined South Africa’s petition at the ICJ to try Israel for attempting to commit 'genocide' in the Gaza Strip even as the noncombatant-to-combatant deaths are about two to one, a ratio whose excellence is almost unheard-of during war. He also repeatedly vilified the IDF for supposedly committing war crimes and referenced the Holocaust in accusing the government of using the October 7 surprise invasion in which Hamas and other terrorists massacred 1,200 people, including women, children and the elderly, as a reason to carry out a 'final solution' against the Palestinians. The committee also referenced pre-war statements Cassif had made justifying Palestinian terrorism against civilians and calling jailed terrorists 'political prisoners.' Cassif was not only unrepentant in his response to the temporary expulsion, he doubled down on his anti-Israel stance. Posting to X that the country was only a 'so-called democracy' that was fast becoming fascist, he called the move 'political censorship' by a 'bloody, evil government' that 'celebrate[s] the killing of innocents' while 'those who fight for justice and peace are persecuted as traitors.' Cassif’s ban extends to participating in or even entering plenary sessions and Knesset committee meetings, although he will be allowed to vote on bills. His pay was docked for two weeks as well. While it was the harshest punishment given to a Knesset member in years, it did not come close to the desire of a vast majority of the legislature to kick him out permanently. In February, 85 MKs voted to oust him, but 90 are necessary for such a move and it failed. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir referenced this when he said, 'The terror supporter Ofer Cassif should be permanently expelled from the Israeli Knesset and deported to Syria. Six months is not enough.' Human rights organization Betsalmo, which had demanded two weeks ago that the Committee meet after Cassif had branded an IDF soldier who fell in Gaza as a 'criminal' and 'monster,' expressed limited satisfaction with the verdict. 'I congratulate the decision to suspend [Cassif] from the Knesset and the monetary fine,' said director Shai Glick, but then added, 'Cassif should be in jail and not the Knesset.' 'Cassif has been a terror supporter for a long time and chooses in Israel’s most dire hour to support the enemy anytime and anywhere, as well as vilify IDF soldiers, even those who fell in battle,' Glick said. 'He [also] has been indicted for the most serious crime of attacking a police officer&#8230; [but] he received a ‘celebrity discount’ and is walking around freely while his trial has been postponed for a long time.' The MK was indicted in January on charges of aggravated assault against a police officer as a result of a fracas in Judea and Samaria in May 2022. This is punishable by a sentence of at least three months but can also be increased to as much as five years in prison.

Report: Netanyahu to resume annexation bid after Trump takes offi...	Israeli prime minister reportedly backing calls from senior government ministers pushing to apply sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria once Donald Trump returns to office. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning on moving forward with plans to apply Israeli sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria, according to a report Tuesday. Kan Reshet Bet reported Tuesday morning that Netanyahu has privately reassured senior government ministers that his sovereignty plans, shelved since President Joe Biden's win in 2020, would be placed back on the agenda after Trump returns to office. During the first Trump administration, Netanyahu proposed to extend Israeli sovereignty over large swaths of Judea and Samaria, beginning with the Jordan Valley and including all Israeli towns in the area. 'I intend to extend sovereignty on all the settlements and settlement blocs,' Netanyahu said on the eve of the September 17th, 2019 elections. The plans were incorporated into President Donald Trump's 'Peace to Prosperity' plan, better known as the 'Deal of the Century,' under which Israel would apply sovereignty to large sections of Area C in Judea and Samaria, spanning all areas of Israeli settlement. In exchange, Israel would agree to the broader peace deal, which would endorse the establishment of a Palestinian state in parts of Judea, Samaria, all of the Gaza Strip, and several enclaves in the Israeli Negev. Following the Hamas invasion of October 7th, some members of Netanyahu's coalition government have called for the annexation of the Gaza Strip, as well as Judea and Samaria. Calls for applying Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria were voiced again following Donald Trump's electoral win on November 5th. 'Now this is the time for sovereignty, this is the time for total victory,' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) said in an address to the Knesset plenum last Wednesday. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) declared in a press conference Monday that 2025 will 'be the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.' 'I gave instructions to the settlement administration in the Ministry of Defense and to the Civil Administration to begin comprehensive professional staff work to prepare the necessary infrastructure for the application of sovereignty.' 'Subsequently, I intend to lead a government decision stating that the Government of Israel will act with the new administration of President Trump and the international community to apply sovereignty and seek American recognition.' Israel Ganz, chairman of the Yesha Council – which represents all Israeli towns across Judea and Samaria – and mayor of the Binyamin Regional Council, took to X/Twitter to call for annexing Judea and Samaria following Trump’s victory. 'Time for sovereignty! One strong Trump. One Jewish state.'

House set to vote on bill targeting nonprofits accused of support...	Critics of the bill say it grants too much power to the government and that it could be used to silence political dissent. By Asaf Elia-Shalev, JTA U.S. law prohibits nonprofits from providing support to terrorist organizations, but enforcing that prohibition requires the government to furnish proof of a violation, triggering a judicial process that can be lengthy and arduous. In the more than two decades since the current law was enacted, following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the law has rarely led to penalties: nine charities have lost their tax-exempt status under its terms. A bipartisan bill slated for a major vote on Capitol Hill Tuesday aims to create a new way to achieve that goal without the existing legal hurdles. The bill would give the treasury secretary new powers to independently classify any nonprofit as a terrorist-supporting organization and revoke its tax-exempt status almost immediately. A version of the bill was introduced following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas invasion of Israel and passed the House in April, amid a wave of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, which many pro-Israel groups labeled as 'pro-Hamas.' The bill advanced with broad bipartisan support, 382-11, but stalled in the Senate. Now, the new version of the bill is dividing Jewish groups. Centrist and conservative groups support the bill as an urgent measure to curb support for terrorism. Progressive organizations oppose it as a threat to political dissent — and worry that the powers it affords will be abused by the incoming Trump administration to go after groups that oppose its policies. At a September hearing, Robert Harvey, an expert at Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, explained that the government would not be required to disclose how it reached its determination or to provide any evidence of wrongdoing. 'As I understand it, all the Treasurer has to do to deny tax exemption is to mail a notice to the organization involved saying: ‘You’re a terrorist supporting organization, we have found you are providing material support, and you’re denied your exemption?’' Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett asked Harvey, according to The Intercept. 'That’s correct, Mr. Doggett,' Harvey replied. Lawmakers sponsoring the bill say the government needs a better tool to prevent terrorist organizations from being subsidized by American taxpayers. Their position is endorsed by the Anti-Defamation League, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and the Republican Jewish Coalition. The bill would allow the Treasury Department to act against the U.S.-registered charities that it determines have provided support to groups designated as terrorist organizations by the United States — including, for example, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, both based in Gaza, and the Lebanese Hezbollah. After making the determination, the Treasury would notify the charity, giving it 90 days to file a court challenge before losing its tax-exempt status. Republican Rep. David Kustoff of Tennessee, one of the bill’s two Jewish cosponsors along with Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois, says the problem isn’t theoretical: He claims tax-exempt donations are currently flowing to terrorist organizations, though neither he nor any other proponents of the bill have named specific examples. 'To put it plainly, domestic financiers of terrorism are currently being subsidized by U.S. taxpayer dollars,' Kustoff said earlier this year. 'Let me be clear: No American should receive a tax benefit for funding terrorism.' The RJC said the bill should be used to ensure that Hamas and other terrorist organizations are not receiving any funds from U.S. nonprofits, and framed it as a tool against groups that attack American Jews and Israel. 'Congress is right to address the threat of organizations using tax-exempt funds to support Hamas and other terrorist groups,' RJC said in a statement. 'In case last week’s election results didn’t make it clear: The days of impunity for antisemitic extremists who target the Jewish state and Jewish Americans are over.' Critics of the bill say it grants too much power to the government and that it could be used to silence political dissent — particularly from pro-Palestinian organizations that don’t have ties to terror groups but may nonetheless be branded as supporters of Hamas. The language of the bill prohibits providing 'material support or resources,' a category defined in law that, opponents say, could still be interpreted broadly. They also worry that the incoming Trump administration could use the bill to penalize groups focusing on signature progressive issues such as reproductive justice, the environment, and promoting immigration. The American Civil Liberties Union has been spearheading opposition to the bill with support from voices on both sides of the political spectrum. The libertarian Cato Institute and Reason magazine, for example, have come out against the bill. So have several progressive American Jewish groups such as Bend the Arc and the New Israel Fund. 'This bill is as dangerous as it is extraneous,' the New Israel Fund, which donates to civil society groups in Israel, many of them left-leaning, said in a statement. 'The United States already has a meticulous process in place to determine whether a group is providing material support for terrorism. What this would do is strip that system of due process and enable willy-nilly terrorist designations.' The bill is scheduled for a full vote in the House of Representatives Tuesday, after which it would have to be approved by the Senate and signed by the president. The current version of the bill is identical to the one that passed in April, except that it’s been combined with another bill that aims to give American hostages and political prisoners held abroad relief from tax deadlines and penalties. The ACLU believes the pairing with an unobjectionable bill is a ploy to weaken the likelihood of opposition.

Ex-IDF soldier becomes first Republican in 50 years to win New Yo...	Though Norber focused his campaign on domestic issues such as bolstering law enforcement and cutting taxes, he believes that his support for Israel also helped him establish valuable inroads with the local Jewish community. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner A former officer in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) became the first Republican to win a state assembly seat in northern Hempstead, Long Island in more than 50 years. Daniel Norber narrowly defeated two-term Democratic incumbent Gina Silitti to capture the 16th District of the New York State Assembly. The district encompasses most of Nassau County, an area which maintains a significant Jewish population. Norber’s victory came amid a huge surge in support for Republican candidates across the country. US President-elect Donald Trump won the 16th District by over 2,000 votes, assisting Norber, a dual US-Israeli citizen, secure victory in his history-making down-ballot race. The ex-IDF officer’s win also came in the midst of increasing antisemitism across the country. In the year following the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel last Oct. 7, Jewish families in Nassau County have reported being targeted with hate crimes. In September, a Jewish family in Nassau County alleged that a suspect urinated on their front door and yelled antisemitic slurs. Months earlier in April, county officials denounced antisemitic graffiti which covered the faces of hostages taken captive by Hamas during the Oct. 7 onslaught. Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, who is Jewish, has also accused Civil Service Employees Association Local 830, an 8,000-member local union, of antisemitism for distributing flyers depicting him with devil horns. Silitti, Norber’s opponent, found herself in hot water with the local Jewish community after one of her staffers bashed Israel on social media. 'She wasn’t sensitive to what was going on. I felt she was out of touch,' Norber, 45, told the New York Post. Moreover, his grandparents endured the Holocaust and his mother ran away from communism in the Soviet Union. Norber was also on the ground in Israel during the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks with his wife and four kids. 'It was the worst atrocity to Jews since the Holocaust. Israel is not the same anymore,' Norber said, according to the Post. Norber has also touted a series of policies which would likely bolster Jewish safety in Nassau County. In the New York State Assembly, he aims to implement a statewide mask ban with the goal of preventing anonymity during protests — a popular tactic employed by activists during anti-Israel demonstrations to hid their identity. The lawmaker also wants to repeal cashless bail, with the intention of reducing the number of violent criminals on the streets.

Climate activist Greta Thunberg accuses Turkey of quietly support...	Radical Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg appears to call for Israel's destruction with 'Free Palestine - From the River to the Sea' slogan. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg accused the Turkish government of quietly backing Israel, despite Ankara's imposition of a trade ban on Israel adopted in May, and the bombastic anti-Israel rhetoric of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Sunday, the 21-year-old activist issued a video statement calling on her supporters to join demonstrations around the world outside Turkish embassies, protesting the use of the Baku, Tbilisi, Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline to transfer Azerbaijani oil to Israel, via the Turkish port city of Ceyhan. 'This is an urgent call to action. On November 11th, we must stand together at Turkish embassies worldwide to demand an end to Turkey's and Azerbaijan's complicity in the violence against Gaza,' Thunberg said. 'President Erdogan talks of solidarity with Palestine, but Turkey's ports remain open, allowing oil to flow to Israel, fuel for the very machinery slaughtering Palestinians.' 'The The BTC pipeline, run by BP and Azerbaijan state-owned oil company SOCAR, supplies nearly half of Israel's oil. Erdogan and [Azerbaijan's president, Ilham] Aliyev profit by securing their foothold in the global energy market, while Palestinians pay with their lives.' 'On November 11th, we'll gather at Turkish embassies around the world to demand justice for Palestine and for Turkey and Azerbaijan to end their complicity.' Thunberg reiterated her accusation of genocide in the Gaza Strip, and appeared to call for the destruction of the State of Israel. 'Stop fueling genocide!' Thunberg said. 'Free Palestine, From the River to the Sea.' Turkey's Energy Ministry denied that Azerbaijani oil is currently being shipped to Israel via Ceyhan, claiming that such shipments were terminated following the May 2024 trade ban on Israel. In a statement Monday, the ministry said it was bound by a 1999 agreement establishing the BTC pipeline not to interfere with the transfer of energy, while at the same time denouncing 'accusations' that oil continues to be shipped to Israel via Ceyhan as ' completely baseless.' 'Companies transporting oil through the BTC pipeline for export to global markets from the Haydar Aliyev Terminal, have respected Turkey's recent decision not to engage in trade with Israel,' the ministry said. 'No deliveries to Israel as the delivery destination have taken place.'

Amsterdam pogrom, protests coordinated with ‘extremist’ network l...	The coordination behind these events reflects a well-honed strategy by radical groups to use public gatherings to incite and escalate violence. By Debbie Weiss, The Algemeiner The violence against Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam last week was a premeditated and coordinated attack orchestrated with extremist networks linked to a former employee of the controversial United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), a group tracking online disinformation told The Algemeiner on Monday. The Network Contagion Research Institute’s analysis of open-source intelligence and social media also 'revealed that protests around the Maccabi Tel Aviv game in Amsterdam was not isolated but part of a broader, coordinated effort,' said the group’s co-founder, Joel Finkelstein. Amsterdam resident Ayman Nejmeh, who identified himself on social media as a former UNRWA employee, 'has emerged as a key organizer, coordinating protest actions against Jewish targets,' Finkelstein added. Hundreds of Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer fans, who were visiting the Dutch capital for a game against the local Ajax team, were attacked by Arab and Muslim mobs on Thursday night, landing several in the hospital. It marked the largest mass-scale antisemitic incident in the Netherlands since the Holocaust, with attackers throwing firecrackers and stun grenades, calling for a 'Jew hunt,' and forcing Israelis to say 'Free Palestine' before beating them up. Earlier, Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were recorded chanting anti-Arab slogans and removing a Palestinian flag, prompting some news outlets to frame the ensuing violence as a response. But Israel had issued a warning to Dutch security services ahead of the game that violence was likely to unfold after Islamic groups appeared to be coordinating a multifront attack on social media. According to Finkelstein, the phone number of the Syrian-born Nejmeh was listed as an admin for one WhatsApp group utilized by the Palestinian diaspora group, PGNL. Nejmeh took over the group from Palestinian-Dutch national Amin Abou Rashed, who was arrested last year on suspicion of funneling funds to the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. PGNL had in the past hosted the late Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran earlier this year, in an online event. The group, whose name in Dutch stands for the 'Palestinian Community in the Netherlands,' was also involved in organizing an anti-Israel protest in Dam Square on Sunday, defying a temporary ban imposed after Thursday night’s violence and resulting in dozens of arrests. The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), whose research spans issues from social media bans to online antisemitism, has collaborated with legislative bodies, including the British government and US Congress, on content moderation and combating hate-based misinformation. The group said that its own findings aligned with that of the European Leadership Network, pointing to a transnational network that is actively stoking anti-Jewish sentiments. The coordination behind these events reflects a well-honed strategy by radical groups to use public gatherings to incite and escalate violence, Finkelstein said, warning that organized hate was far outpacing authorities’ ability to respond. 'The ‘pogrom contagion’ spreading across Europe is no accident — terror-linked actors are deliberately weaponizing gatherings and social media to accelerate the spread of violence against Jewish communities,' Finkelstein told The Algemeiner. 'This infrastructure of hate is evolving faster than democratic defenses and, left unchecked, these threats multiply across both borders and ethnicities.' Nejmeh’s Facebook profile, which contained at least one post extolling a Hamas operative for the terrorist group’s Al Qassam military wing, was in recent days purged of any mention of his ties to UNRWA. 'If Nejmeh is scrubbing his social media of these past affiliations, it does raise significant questions about why,' Finkelstein said. Last month, Israel’s parliament passed legislation banning UNRWA from operating in Israel and stopping Israeli authorities from cooperating with the organization, citing the UN agency’s ties to Hamas and what critics described as its 'poisonous influence' in the Middle East. Marcus Sheff, head of IMPACT-se, a research institute monitoring UNRWA, said the findings were further evidence of the refugee agency’s corruption. 'It’s shocking that the organizer of this brutal assault is yet another former UNRWA teacher, funded by American taxpayers for years,' Sheff told The Algemeiner. The Israeli government and research organizations have publicized findings showing numerous UNRWA-employed teachers were directly involved in Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel last Oct. 7, while many others openly celebrated it. The Algemeiner could not independently verify whether Nejmeh, who moved to the Netherlands from Syria in 2018, held a teaching role at UNRWA or served in another capacity. 'Time and again, we have seen UNRWA staff, including school principals, exposed as active terrorists. If there were any lingering doubts after Oct. 7, this serves as another stark proof of a deep-seated rot within UNRWA’s organizational culture,' Sheff added.

Netanyahu alerted about October 7th attacks just 10 minutes befor...	October 7th, 2023 was also the first time Shin Bet had told the Prime Minister about the activation of Israeli SIM cards in the Gaza Strip and that leaders of the terror group were hiding in underground bunkers. By World Israel News Staff After more than a year of speculation, it has come to light that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was informed by Israel's security agency (Shin Bet) about the October 7th attacks just ten minutes before they happened, Kan News reports. Shin Bet informed the Prime Minister at 6:19 on Saturday morning for the first time that there was unusual activity by Hamas at the border. Saturday morning, October 7th, 2023, was also the first time Shin Bet had told the Prime Minister about the activation of Israeli SIM cards in the Gaza Strip and that leaders of the terror group were hiding in underground bunkers, apparently preparing for an attack. After a six-minute conversation, Netanyahu and Shin Bet agreed to have a situational assessment at 8:00. The military secretary, General Avi Gil, then called the head of the chief of staff's office. During their conversation, at 6:29, the missile barrage began. Although Netanyahu was not informed of the situation at the Gaza border until shortly before the attack occurred, there is some indication that the IDF and Shin Bet were aware of irregular activity at the border among Hamas terrorists sometime prior to October 7th. According to Yedioth Aharonoth, the sudden mass activation of Israeli SIM cards by Gaza terrorists has been known for months but was suppressed by Israeli military censors. Hundreds of Israeli SIM cards, used to provide cellular service via Israeli providers, were activated at around midnight between October 6th and 7th, multiple Israeli news outlets reported, just hours before the invasion of Israel that caught the IDF off guard and left some 1,200 Israelis dead and 253 in captivity. The reports claim that IDF and Shin Bet intel officials detected approximately 1,000 Israeli SIM cards being activated at around midnight on October 7th. They were left puzzled by the mass activation and, because SIM card activations had not been flagged in the past as indications of an impending attack, did not warn IDF Central Command of a possible invasion. While some outlets, including Channel 14, said that roughly 1,000 SIM card activations were detected, the Israeli military and the Shin Bet internal security agency released a joint statement Monday downplaying the claims, calling them 'false and far from reality. ' They said that ' only' several dozen SIM card activations had been detected.

57,000 acres of Israeli forests destroyed from Hezbollah rockets	KKL-JNF estimates the ecosystem will require five to seven years to recover naturally. By Jewish Breaking News The environmental impact of Hezbollah’s sustained attacks on northern Israel has reached catastrophic levels, with over 57,000 acres of land destroyed by fires. According to the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF), the Upper Galilee and Golan Heights have borne the brunt of the destruction, with nearly 43,500 acres scorched. The Lower Galilee lost approximately 6,175 acres, while the Western Galilee and Hula Valley suffered burns of 2,223 and 178 acres, respectively. Particularly hard hit were the Birya and Baal Shem Tov forests near Safed, the Ramot Naftali Forest along the Lebanese border, and the Hazon Forest in the vicinity of Karmiel. Wildlife populations have been severely impacted, with birds losing nesting sites and countless arthropods perishing in the flames. The fires have also ravaged a diverse array of woodland species, from pine, cypress, and cedar to indigenous varieties like oak, Judas trees, and carob. However, the damage extends beyond animal life and vegetation, with significant destruction to infrastructure including parking facilities, observation points, and scenic routes. 'Our foresters alongside the Israel Fire and Rescue Services are forced to work under extremely difficult conditions, under the constant threat of both the fires and the rockets,' stated KKL-JNF director Shelli Ben Yishai. 'Despite the enormous challenges, we continue to work around the clock to protect our forests, the people of the North, and its unique environment.' KKL-JNF estimates the ecosystem will require five to seven years to recover naturally. Since Oct. 7, 2023, the IDF estimates that approximately 10,000 Hezbollah rockets and suicide drones have been launched at the Jewish State. To protect Israel’s ecosystem, the agency operates an advanced monitoring station equipped with aerial drones and sophisticated imaging technology, enabling rangers to spot and respond to fire threats before they spread even further.

Iran turns to chemical weapons in war against Israel	Of particular concern is the potential distribution of these weapons to Iran’s terror proxies. By Jewish Breaking News Iran has developed a powerful chemical weapon based on synthetic opioids that can render entire units of soldiers helpless within minutes. The US and its allies have warned for years that Iran is developing pharmaceutical-based weapons in breach of the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. A recent U.S. State Department report revealed that Iran’s Chemistry Department at Imam Hossein University attempted to acquire large quantities of medetomidine, a veterinary sedative, from Chinese suppliers in 2014. The quantity sought – enough for over 10,000 doses – far exceeded any legitimate research needs. Further confirmation came in September 2023 when Iranian anti-government hackers leaked documents exposing details of an Iranian military university’s development of medetomidine-based grenades, according to the State Department. Security experts warn that these pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs) represent a new category of threat, distinct from traditional chemical weapons. When deployed, PBAs target the central nervous system, rapidly rendering victims unconscious. Of particular concern is the potential distribution of these weapons to Iran’s terror proxies. Although Israel’s military campaigns in Lebanon have dealt serious blows to Hezbollah and its massive missile stockpile, PBAs remain a viable threat as they can be easily incorporated into hand grenades and mortar shells – weapons Hezbollah still possesses in large quantities. 'Maybe you just use them to incapacitate the border guards and reach the now unprotected civilians,' Matthew Levitt, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, tells Business Insider. 'Or, you actually target and incapacitate the soldiers so you can kidnap or capture them.' 'At a time of growing regional instability in the Middle East, largely the result of the militancy of Iranian proxies, the threats posed by Iran’s weaponized PBA program can no longer be overlooked,' says Levitt. Levying sanctions on Iran’s import of PBAs is also extremely difficult because they overlap with products used for legitimate medical purposes. The Islamic Republic should know better than anyone the horrific toll of chemical weapons, having suffered over a million casualties from Iraqi nerve gas and mustard gas attacks during the Iran-Iraq war. Yet Tehran has shown no hesitation in deploying these weapons themselves – first using mustard gas against Iraqi forces in 1987, then employing PBAs against Syrian rebels during their civil war, and most recently through their Iraqi militias who reportedly used chemical agents to suppress civilian protesters in 2019.

US set to judge Israel progress on Gaza aid this week	This week we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made,' Jake Sullivan told the CBS program 'Face the Nation.' By Reuters and The Algemeiner The United States this week will decide whether Israel has made progress toward improving the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and how Washington will respond, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday as Israel began to make its case. President Joe Biden’s administration told Israel in an Oct. 13 letter signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that the longtime US ally must take steps within 30 days on a series of measures or risk restrictions on American military aid. 'This week we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made,' Sullivan told the CBS program 'Face the Nation.' 'And then Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, the president will make judgments about what we do in response, and I’m not going to get ahead of that.' COGAT, the Israeli military agency that deals with Palestinian civilian affairs, on Sunday published a list of Israel‘s humanitarian efforts over the past six months, 'highlighting recent initiatives and detailing plans to sustain support for Gaza as winter approaches.' 'Through expanded routes, medical assistance, infrastructure improvements and coordination with international partners, COGAT continues to facilitate the implementation of humanitarian efforts that are meant to help the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,' the agency said. The US deadline is set to expire just days after global food security experts said there is a 'strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas' of northern Gaza as Israel pursues a military offensive against Hamas Palestinian terrorists there. Israel began its wide military push in northern Gaza last month. The United States has said it is watching to ensure that Israel‘s actions on the ground show that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government does not have a 'policy of starvation' in the north. COGAT on Saturday pushed back against the rare alert by the independent Famine Review Committee, which reviews findings by the internationally recognized standard known as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. The Israeli agency said that 'all projections by the IPC have proven incorrect and inconsistent with the situation on the ground' and that Israel‘s military 'operates and will continue to operate in accordance with international law to facilitate and ease the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza.' COGAT also said Friday that it is preparing to open another crossing — at Kissufim — into Gaza. The UN has accused Israel of hindering and blocking attempts to deliver aid, particularly to Gaza‘s north. Israel‘s UN Ambassador Danny Danon last month told the Security Council that the issue in Gaza was not a lack of aid, saying more than a million tons had been delivered during the past year. He accused Hamas of hijacking the assistance.

Syria: Israeli airstrike kills 9 near Homs	The strike targeted a Hezbollah ammunition storage facility on the Homs-Damascus road. By JNS The Israeli Air Force struck targets near the village of Shinshar, located on the outskirts of Homs, Syria on Monday, Syria’s state-run SANA news agency reported. Nine people killed and more than 10 wounded in the strikes, according to the report. According to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is associated with the Syrian opposition, the strike targeted a Hezbollah ammunition storage facility on the Homs-Damascus road. UPDATE Very serious strike in Homs, Syria initial reports of many casualties pic.twitter.com/Na9Huw8Mld &mdash; Open Source Intel (@Osint613) November 11, 2024 The alleged Israeli strike comes after Arab media reported on Sunday that Israel had killed a Hezbollah commander in Syria convicted in 2020 for the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri in 2005. Salim Jamil Ayyashm, a senior member of the Iranian terror proxy’s assassinations unit (Unit 121), was reportedly eliminated near the Syrian city of al-Qusayr in the Homs region. In 2020, he was sentenced in absentia to five life sentences by the U.N.-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon for his role in the assassination of Hariri, who was killed along with 21 others by a car bomb in Beirut on Feb. 14, 2005. The U.S. State Department had offered a $10 million reward for information on his whereabouts. Also on Sunday, Al-Arabiya reported that the head of Hezbollah’s 'Golan file' had been killed in an Israeli strike in Damascus. Ali Daqduq, known as Abu Hussein, held various operational roles with Hezbollah since 1983. In 2006, he was sent to Iraq to aid Shi’ite militias in fighting the United States. He was captured by American forces in Basra and handed over to Iraqi authorities, who released him, after which he returned to Lebanon. The United States believes he was involved in an attack on the Karbala Provincial Coordination Center in which five American soldiers were killed.

Hezbollah taunts IDF, denies it received ceasefire proposal	As long as you cannot control areas in the field, you won't achieve your political goals,' says Hezbollah spokesman, denying the war has taken a toll on the group's missile arsenal. By World Israel News Staff Senior spokesman for the Hezbollah terror organization mocked Israel on Monday, denying that the IDF had taken control of towns in southern Lebanon and rejecting claims that the ongoing war with Israel has taken a toll on Hezbollah's rocket and missile arsenal. Downplaying reports of major progress towards a truce with Israel, Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Afif said Monday that the group has not received any official ceasefire proposal. Afif added that Hezbollah has sufficient weapons and supplies to sustain a prolonged conflict with Israel. The Hezbollah representative also claimed that six weeks into Israel’s ground operations in southern Lebanon, Israeli forces have yet to secure 'even a single village,' an apparent reference to reports of an abortive operation in the the town of Khiam last week. 'As long as you are not able to control areas in the field, you will not achieve your political goals,' Afif said. Despite Afif's claims, Israeli forces have reportedly captured multiple villages close to the border during the ongoing ground offensive. Afif disputed Israeli claims that Hezbollah’s missile arsenal had been substantially depleted, noting that the group continues to launch numerous projectiles daily, targeting areas deep within Israel. On Monday, the terror group launched roughly fifty rockets at the northern Israeli city of Karmiel. While the IDF said that most of the projectiles were either intercepted by Israel's missile defense network or landed in open spaces, at least one rocket struck the Arab Israeli town of Bi’ina, injuring a 27-year-old woman, a 35-year-old man, and an 8-month-old baby. On Sunday, Israeli media outlets reported that Russia has joined efforts by the U.S. to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. A day later, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar confirmed that progress has been made towards a truce, but added that no agreement has yet been reached on an enforcement mechanism to to keep Hezbollah from rebuilding its forces along the Israeli border.

Three people, including a baby, were injured after Hezbollah rockets pounded northern Israeli city, as IDF warns villagers in southern Lebanon to evacuate. By World Israel News Staff At least three people were injured Monday afternoon, after Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon launched roughly 50 rockets at northern Israel. The projectiles were directed towards the city of Karmiel and its environs, with multiple rockets landing inside Karmiel. One rocket struck the Arab Israeli town of Bi'ina, located near Karmiel, injuring a 27-year-old woman, a 35-year-old man, and an 8-month-old baby. Emergency first responders were dispatched to the scene of the attack to treat the injured and evacuate them to a local hospital for further treatment. According to preliminary reports, the female victim is listed in moderate condition, while the 35-year-old man and the baby are both in light condition. In addition to the three victims who were injured in the rocket attacks, a number of other people were treated for shock. Most of the rockets were either intercepted or landed in open spaces causing no damage, the IDF said. The Israeli military called on the residents of villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate, ahead of an apparent airstrike against Hezbollah. The IDF's Arabic spokesman, Avichay Adaree, urged villagers from 21 towns south of the Awali River to leave there homes and move northward. 'Hezbollah's terrorist activities force the IDF to act forcefully against it in these areas, and we do not intend to harm you,' Adaree said. ' For your safety, you must evacuate your homes immediately and move to the north of the Awali River. For your safety, you must evacuate without delay.' 'Anyone who is near Hezbollah elements, facilities or weapons is putting his life in danger.'

It’s Official: Trump taps Elise Stefanik as UN ambassador	New York congresswoman who made headlines grilling university administrators over campus antisemitism has accepted President-elect Donald Trump's offer to become US Ambassador to the United Nations. By World Israel News Staff Former President and President-elect Donald Trump confirmed reports Sunday that he has tapped New York Rep. Elise Stefanik to represent the United States at the United Nations. Over the weekend, it was reported that Trump had offered Stefanik the position of Ambassador to the United Nations. On Sunday, the former president issued a statement to The New York Post confirming that he had made the offer to Stefanik, and adding that the congresswoman had accepted. 'I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,' Trump told The New York Post. 'Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.' Stefanik currently serves as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, and has served in the House of Representatives since January 2015, representing New York's 21st congressional district, a Republican-leaning district in upstate New York. A long-time Trump ally, Stefanik first gained national attention last December during congressional hearings on campus antisemitism, during which she grilled a number of senior university administrators over their failure to combat anti-Jewish bigotry following the October 7th invasion. Stefanik issued a statement confirming that she had accepted the nomination, which must still be approved by the Senate following Trump's inauguration on January 20th. 'I am truly honored to earn President Trump’s nomination to serve in his Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,' Stefanik said in a statement issued to the Post. 'During my conversation with President Trump, I shared how deeply humbled I am to accept his nomination and that I look forward to earning the support of my colleagues in the United States Senate.' 'President Trump’s historic landslide election has given hope to the American people and is a reminder that brighter days are ahead — both at home and abroad.' 'America continues to be the beacon of the world, but we expect and must demand that our friends and allies be strong partners in the peace we seek.' The announcement comes a day after Trump ruled out bringing back two former administration officials, including Nikki Haley, who served as ambassador to the UN during the first two years of Trump's presidency.

‘Outrageous demand’ – Court demands Israeli taxpayers cover Octob...	Israeli judiciary orders state to pay nearly one million shekels to Arab law firm representing terrorists from Hamas' elite Nukhba Force which carried out atrocities against Israelis on October 7th. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli judiciary is demanding that Israeli taxpayers pay nearly one million shekels in legal fees for the defense of Hamas terrorists from an elite unit directly responsible for the invasion of October 7th and subsequent massacres of Israelis, according to a report Monday. Arutz Sheva reported that an Arab Israeli law firm which has been providing legal services to Hamas terrorists from the elite Nukhba Force for nearly a year is demanding close to one million shekels ($267,985) from the state treasury, after multiple government ministries refused to foot the bill. Thus far, the Justice Ministry and the National Security Ministry have both refused to reimburse the firm representing the Nukhba Force terrorists, according to the report. An Israeli court is now ordering the Finance Ministry, which administers the state treasury, to cover the terrorists' legal expenses. The issue first arose after the Knesset passed emergency legislation following the October 7th invasion, barring jailed terrorists captured during the current war from being assigned a public defender to represent them. Since then, Israeli courts have ruled that terrorists on trial must still be provided with legal representation, ordering the state to cover their legal fees. By mid-July, at least 80 Nukhba Force terrorists had received court backing for state-funded legal representation. A spokesperson for the Judicial Authority downplayed the court decisions, arguing that the Knesset's legislation barring public defenders from representing terrorists effectively tied the courts' hands. 'The appointment of a lawyer for a Nukhba detainee is not something which is up to the discretion of the court, and representation of a suspect is a prerequisite for holding the hearing via video conference. This is required by the law.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) has ordered the treasury not to transfer funds to cover the legal fees of Nukhba terrorists. 'The citizens of Israel will not fund the legal defense of our despicable enemies,' Smotrich declared. Minister of Construction and Housing Yitzhak Goldknopf (United Torah Judaism) excoriated the judiciary's demand that the treasury pay for terrorists' legal fees. 'This is an absurd and outrageous demand,' Goldknopf tweeted. 'The tax money of the citizens of Israel is not supposed to fund legal representation for the human monsters who massacred men, women and children with terrible cruelty.' 'I call on the Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich not to respond to the request and refer them to their friends in Turkey, Qatar and the Palestinian Terrorist Authority.' The Knesset’s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee has given preliminary approval for legislation which would not only bar terrorists arrested for acts committed on October 7th from being represented by public defenders, but would also prevent the state from funding their defense in any way.

Will Iran strike Israel before Trump inauguration?	On the campaign trial and in his victory speech, Trump repeatedly pledged to 'end wars,' rather than start them. By World Israel News Staff Israeli intelligence and defense agencies anticipate that Iran will attack Israel during the final days of the Biden administration, before president-elect Donald Trump takes office. Due to Trump's support for Israel and his tough stance on Iran, officials in Tehran may view the period before the inauguration on January 20th as its last opportunity to attack Israel. According to a report in Hebrew-language outlet Walla, Iran is planning a response to Israel's October strike on the Islamic Republic, which took out much of the country's air defenses and crippled its missile and drone manufacturing capabilities. Defense and intelligence officials, speaking anonymously to the outlet, said that the Iranian attack may come via its regional proxy groups, presumably to create plausible deniability and discourage a retaliatory strike on Iranian soil. Iran is particularly interested in having its proxies launch an October 7th-style ground invasion of Israel. Originally, Iran planned to have forces - who would not be Iranian army soldiers, but rather members of terror groups such as the Houthis and other Shia-aligned militias - infiltrate Israel via the northern Lebanese and Syrian borders. Due to Israel's invasion of southern Lebanon and heavy troop presence along the Syrian border, Iran has since abandoned that idea and may be gearing up for an invasion via the Jordanian border. It's unclear if Trump would support an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities with American military assets. On the campaign trial and in his victory speech, Trump repeatedly pledged to 'end wars,' rather than start them. However, Trump has held at least three phone calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in recent days. The premier said that the two men 'see eye-to-eye' on pressing issues, presumably including the Iran nuclear threat. Trump has also signaled that he will resume his previous policies of harsh sanctions against Iran, aimed at freezing the country's assets and preventing Tehran from funding terror.

Russia working with US to broker Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire – rep...	One of the major players would be Russia as guarantor that Syria would not continue to be a weapons pipeline. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Details emerged on a possible ceasefire deal between Hezbollah and Israel that would include Russia as one of its major players as well as the U.S. and the Lebanese army, Channel 12 reported Sunday night. Amit Segal reported that once the deal is concluded, the IDF would withdraw most of its forces from southern Lebanon, leaving only a small presence in the villages on the Lebanese side of the border for 60 days, while Hezbollah would withdraw to behind the Litani River. During what Segal called 'the second stage,' the Lebanese army would enter the area, 'and when they finish,' the IDF would return completely to Israel and the permanent ceasefire would officially begin. The implication was that the Lebanese would complete the job of ridding the border area of all Hezbollah weaponry and rockets before the IDF left. This would in essence be the implementation of the major conditions of UN Security Resolution 1701 that ended the Second Lebanon War. What was left unsaid in the report is that Hezbollah is known to have thoroughly infiltrated the national army, and therefore the willingness of the soldiers on the ground to fulfill any such mission may be considered questionable. Israeli troops have found thousands of rifles, machine guns, ammunition, rockets and their launchers, explosive devices and other weapons throughout the villages they have already cleared, as well as underneath them in Hezbollah-dug tunnels. Russia will be an indirect but important player in the deal, Segal said, as it will ostensibly be the guarantor 'that Syria will not continue to be a weapons highway' to Hezbollah. Moscow maintains a mostly discreet military presence and has great influence in Syria, having helped dictator Bashar Assad retain power and take back about half his country from various rebel groups after civil war broke out in his country in 2011. According to various Hebrew media Monday, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer secretly visited Russia last week for four days to discuss details of their involvement in the ceasefire process. It seems that President Vladimir Putin is seriously considering answering positively, as a 'senior Kremlin official' told Kan News that 'Russia is prepared to assist and support anything that would stop the killing of civilians and prevent the destruction of civilian infrastructure.' According to Segal, the 'dividends' that Russia would receive from its cooperation would be two-fold. One is respect, as 'this is an international agreement of insane proportions,' he said. The other is that 'The Biden administration will allow Russian companies that function in Syria to be exempt from sanctions' that most international Russian business are subject to due to the country’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Global sanctions on Russia have hit its economy badly in the almost three years since its play to annex its southern neighbor began. Israel is looking to enshrine its right to oversee the disarmament and ability to enter Lebanon if it sees that Hezbollah is again rearming and taking over the border area. Jerusalem is seeking an American commitment that Washington will back its right to do so. Segal speculated that after Donald Trump assumes office, it will be easier for Israel to take action over the border. Meanwhile, Dermer is landing in the American capital Monday to possibly hammer out these and other details of the incipient agreement.

Houthis fire ballistic missile at Israel, targeting a central arm...	Interceptor fragments caused a fire in Beit Shemesh. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Houthi terror organization in Yemen launched a ballistic missile at Israel’s central region Monday morning that was knocked out before reaching Israel’s coastline, the IDF announced. As per Israeli safety guidelines, warning sirens still sounded at 5:55 AM over large sections of the Plains, Judea, and Lachish regions, sending hundreds of thousands of residents running to safe areas. Fragments of an interceptor missile caused a fire in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Beit Shemesh, which the authorities quickly took care of. Locals spoke of a car and some bushes going up in flames. 'Simultaneously with the extinguishing operations,' the Jerusalem region fire service said in a statement, 'the firefighters are carrying out additional scans in the area, in order to rule out additional fires and damage from interceptor/missile shrapnel.' No one was injured in the incident. The Iran-backed group claimed they were aiming for the Sorek army base, which is located between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and about 20 kilometers from Beit Shemesh. It is one of many of the army’s techno-logistical bases, an Ammunition and Missile Center where parts are stored and supplied to IDF units, soldiers are trained in their use, and work is done there to salvage damaged ammunition. Both civilians and soldiers work at the base. Turkish news agency Anadolu reported that the Houthis claimed their projectile was a 'hypersonic' missile, with spokesman Yahya Saree saying that it had 'precisely hit' its target. Since the Israel-Hamas war began last October after the Gazan terrorists crashed through the border and murdered 1,200 people, the Houthis have shot more than 220 cruise and ballistic missiles and UAVs at the Jewish state to support their fellow Iranian proxy. A very small minority have gotten through Israel’s air defenses, including one in September that was intercepted but not completely destroyed, resulting in missile and interceptor fragments causing some damage to a Modiin train station and a fire in an open area. Israel has also targeted a vital Houthi-held port in Yemen and destroyed several military sites in two long-range airstrikes of its own. The missile launch came a few hours after a Houthi TV outlet reported that the U.S. and Great Britain had conducted several airstrikes in Yemen. Neither country acknowledged an attack, although the two have hit Houthi targets several times this year in retaliation for the terrorists’ repeated missile launches against cargo ships passing their country in international waters. The Houthis’ stated motivation is to support its fellow Iranian client, Hamas, in its war against Israel. Although they say they want to damage the country by stopping shipping to the Jewish state, they have mostly targeted cargoes that have nothing to do with Israel. This has caused many companies to forego the shortest route to the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal, which has meant a tremendous loss of revenue for its owner, Egypt.

Trump rules out bringing back two pro-Israel stalwarts from first...	Ambassador Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, both prominent pro-Israel figures in the first Trump administration, will not be returning to the new administration, Trump announces. By World Israel News Staff Former President and President-elect Donald Trump has ruled out bringing back two pro-Israel stalwarts from his first administration, the incoming president announced over the weekend. In a post to the Truth Social platform on Saturday, Trump wrote that Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations during the first two years of his presidency, would not be tapped to serve in any capacity in the new administration. Haley challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, and initially refused to endorse the former president, before giving his presidential run her backing at the party national convention. Trump also ruled out bringing Mike Pompeo back into his new administration. Pompeo, a former congressman representing Kansas' Fourth Congressional District, served as Director of the CIA under President Trump, before becoming Secretary of State. Between his two roles as CIA director and Secretary of State, Pompeo served throughout the entire four years of the Trump presidency. 'I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' Haley responded via X/Twitter to Trump's post, wishing him 'great success' in his new administration. 'I was proud to work with President Trump defending America at the United Nations. I wish him, and all who serve, great success in moving us forward to a stronger, safer America over the next four years.' On Sunday, Pompeo tweeted that he was 'proud to work with' Trump during his first administration. 'As you said, when we were together last week, you and I built the plan that made the world safer & led to no new wars. America firmly rejected the Biden-Harris foreign policy agenda.

‘How did you spend $1 billion and not win?’: Biden and Harris aid...	Some staffers on Biden's team resent Harris for not using the president more on the campaign trail. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Staffers for Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden are pointing fingers at one another for President-elect Donald Trump’s decisive victory, Axios reported. 'How did you spend $1 billion and not win? What the f—?' a former Biden staffer said of the Harris campaign. After an unprecedented campaign in which Biden passed the baton to his vice president late in the race, the Democratic Party suffered a crushing defeat that left the GOP in control of the White House, Senate, and, most likely, the House. In the wake of their defeat, some of Biden’s team are calling out the Harris team for sidelining the president for much of the campaign. 'The Harris team benched [Biden], and then they lost, so now the people who represent Biden are saying, 'Maybe you shouldn't have benched him,’' a person familiar with the Biden-Harris inner workings said. He added that some staffers on Biden's team resent Harris for not using the president more on the campaign trail. The Harris team, however, blamed the octogenarian president for their loss, arguing his unpopularity and late exit from the race set them up for failure. 'We did what we could. I think the odds against us were insurmountable,' one individual involved with Harris's team said. 'The 107-day Harris campaign was nearly flawless. The Biden campaign that preceded it was the opposite,' another person involved in the vice president's campaign told Axios. Top Harris aide David Plouffe posted on X that the campaign had 'dug out of a deep hole' in a jab at Biden's team. He later deleted his account. Other aides blamed the Biden administration's failed economic policies, which became voters’ top issue this election cycle. 'It's very clear we got it wrong on economic policy. People feel squeezed, and when they do, they pick change. Our policy position and execution wasn't palpable to voters,' one former Biden administration official said. 'The party was lied to about our candidate, and the leadership who lied were the same ones who never bothered to actually listen to voters and understand what was appealing to them about Trump—or why the Biden economy wasn't working for them even if it looked good on paper,' another former Biden administration official added.

Report: Jared Kushner returns to Trump’s inner circle	Meanwhile, Trump’s transition team is currently vetting candidates for key national security positions. By Jewish Breaking News Jared Kushner has returned to closely assist his father-in-law Donald Trump in building the new administration, reports Israel Hayom. During Trump’s previous term, Kushner served as a senior adviser and emerged as a pivotal figure in securing Israel’s security, most notably orchestrating the Abraham Accords, which established historic diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states including the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco. However, it’s not clear if Kushner will take a prominent role in Trump’s next administration, with the Financial Times reporting he will not return to the White House but could serve in an outside advisory capacity on Middle East policy. Sources familiar with the matter indicate Kushner may leverage his established relationships with senior officials in the Gulf states and Israel to advance the administration’s diplomatic goals, particularly in expanding the Abraham Accords to include Saudi Arabia. Since leaving Washington, Kushner has focused on private ventures, establishing Affinity Partners, a $3 billion investment fund backed largely by Gulf sovereign wealth funds. It has drawn scrutiny from Senate Finance Committee chairman Ron Wyden, who questioned whether Kushner’s financial ties represent a compensation scheme designed in part to skirt federal disclosure requirements. Kushner maintains his company follows all regulations. As for Trump’s daughter Ivanka, she still wants to have an impact on public life without getting too much involved come January. 'I expect that we could see Ivanka work with tech leaders and talk about child safety on the internet, as well as her concerns about child trafficking, that’s the kind of thing she concentrated on in the White House,' a source close to the family tells Page Six. 'I think we’ll see her utilize her power in that way.' Meanwhile, Trump’s transition team is currently vetting candidates for key national security positions. Victoria Coates, a former National Security Council official, and Miguel Correa, a retired major general who worked with Kushner on the Abraham Accords, are reportedly under consideration for Middle East-focused roles. Richard Grenell, former ambassador to Germany, is being considered for Secretary of State or National Security Adviser, while Mike Pompeo and Congressman Mike Waltz may take charge over the Pentagon.

Trump reportedly offers Stefanik UN envoy role	A great choice,' wrote David Friedman, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel. By JNS President-elect Donald Trump has offered Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), chair of the House Republican Conference, the role of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in his upcoming administration, CNN reported. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) congratulated Stefanik and wrote that she 'will take the United Nations by storm, take on the anti-U.S. and Israel bigotry, combat Jew-hatred and hold adversaries to account.' 'Elise will be a strong voice advancing U.S. foreign policy and helping to reestablish America’s leading role in the world,' Lawler added. Jason Brodsky, policy director at United Against Nuclear Iran, wrote that the congresswoman, who is 'a big proponent of maximum pressure on Iran’s regime,' would be 'an excellent U.N. ambassador.' 'Screams and cries being reported all over Turtle Bay,' wrote Richard Goldberg, senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'A great choice,' wrote David Friedman, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel. Earlier in the day, Stefanik wrote that it was 'day 400.' 'It has been 400 days since Hamas terrorists abducted innocent civilians during the barbaric Oct. 7 attack in Israel,' she wrote. 'There are over 100 still being held hostage in Gaza, including seven Americans. We must bring them home now.' The congresswoman has been one of the most vocal members of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce in its efforts to investigate American universities for failing to protect Jews on campus.

Jewish member of infamous ‘Texas 7’ gang gets new trial	In a vote of 6-3 the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Halprin’s conviction this past week after finding that the presiding judge, Vickers Cunningham, demonstrated profound antisemitic prejudice. By Jewish Breaking News A Jewish member of the notorious ‘Texas 7’ gang has been granted a new trial after evidence revealed the judge who condemned him to death harbored deep antisemitic prejudices. Randy Halprin, 47, was one of seven inmates who orchestrated one of Texas’ most dramatic prison breaks in December 2000. After breaking out, Halprin and company embarked on a series of robberies that culminated in the killing of Irving police officer Aubrey Hawkins, 29, who was shot 11 times. While five of his accomplices have either been executed or died by suicide, Halprin’s case has taken a dramatic turn due to revelations about the trial judge’s bias. In a vote of 6-3 the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Halprin’s conviction this past week after finding that the presiding judge, Vickers Cunningham, demonstrated profound antisemitic prejudice. ‘The uncontradicted evidence supports a finding that Cunningham formed an opinion about Halprin that derived from an extrajudicial factor — Cunningham’s poisonous antisemitism,’ the appeals court wrote in its ruling. Evidence also showed Cunningham had ‘repeated unsupported antisemitic narratives’ throughout his life and continued to use derogatory language about Jewish people with ‘great hatred and disgust’ during his tenure on the bench. Questions about Cunningham’s prejudices first emerged publicly in 2018 when he told the Dallas Morning News about his family trust, which provided financial incentives for his children to marry straight, white Christians. Despite admitting his previous opposition to interracial marriage, he claimed to have changed his views. ‘The Court of Criminal Appeals took a step towards broader trust in the criminal law by throwing out a hopelessly tainted death judgment handed down by a bigoted and biased judge,’ said Tivon Schardl, Halprin’s attorney. While Halprin’s role in the Texas 7’s crimes remains undisputed, the court’s ruling ensures his right to a fair trial untainted by religious prejudice. His co-defendant Patrick Murphy remains the only other living member of the Texas 7, currently awaiting execution.'

Most Israeli Jews support continuation of Lebanon war	A clear majority (62.5%) agreed that the IDF’s Oct. 16 killing of leader Yahya Sinwar has brought Israel closer to achieving its goal of toppling the terrorist group’s rule in Gaza. By JNS A majority of Jewish Israelis back the continuation of the Israel Defense Forces military operations in Southern Lebanon, a survey published by the Israel Democracy Institute on Sunday shows. The IDI’s Viterbi Family Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research conducted the November 2024 Israeli Voice Index, which included surveys of 600 men and women in Hebrew, and 150 in Arabic, between Oct. 28 and Nov. 4. The maximum sampling error was ±3.58% at a confidence level of 95%, according to the Israel Democracy Institute. The survey asked, 'In the current situation, on what should Israel focus its efforts in Lebanon?' A majority of Jewish Israeli respondents (54%) said they support a continuation of the fighting, while a minority (38%) expressed support for ceasefire negotiations with the Lebanese state. Asked who should control Southern Lebanon after the war, Israeli Jews are split between a multinational military force (37.5%) and the IDF itself (30.5%), with 21.5% saying the Lebanese Armed Forces, 1% answering a weakened Hezbollah, and 9.5% saying they don’t know. The largest proportion of Jewish respondents told IDI pollsters that they believe the some 60,000 displaced Israeli civilians will be able to return to their homes near the northern border within six months to a year (27%), followed by three to six months (23%) and 30 to 90 days (16.5%). Turning to the southern front with Hamas, a clear majority (62.5%) agreed that the IDF’s Oct. 16 killing of leader Yahya Sinwar has brought Israel closer to achieving its goal of toppling the terrorist group’s rule in Gaza. On the Iranian issue, Jews are divided between thinking the IDF responded 'appropriately strong' or 'too weak' (both 43%) to the Islamic Republic’s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attacks on the Jewish state. Israel has been battling Iran and its regional terrorist proxies—including Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Yemen’s Houthis—since Hamas launched its Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in which approximately 1,200 people, primarily Israeli civilians, were murdered.

‘Blood libel, coup’ – Netanyahu’s son slams Shin Bet probe	Yair Netanyahu compared Israel to a 'banana republic in South America in the 1960s.' By World Israel News Staff The son of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the Shin Bet intelligence agency and the IDF leadership in a social media post on Sunday evening, claiming that they were conspiring to undemocratically oust his father from power via a series of fabricated scandals. The Shin Bet and the IDF's top brass are carrying out a 'blood libel' in order to 'gaslight' and distract the public from the reality of 'what actually happened' in the early hours of October 7th, when warnings about an impending terror attack were allegedly ignored, Yair Netanyahu wrote on his X account. Netanyahu also referenced the large protests against the judicial reform, along with reservists refusing to report for duty, immediately preceding the massacres. 'We had a coup against the democratic choice of the people by the prosecutor's office, the media and the courts,' Netanyahu continued, comparing Israel to a 'banana republic in South America in the 1960s.' The younger Netanyahu also questioned the Shin Bet's priorities in focusing its attention on members of the IDF and Netanyahu's advisors, rather than terrorists who pose a threat to national security. 'The same Shin Bet that is now arresting and torturing IDF officers for nonsense is the same Shin Bet that a few months ago released the Dr. Mengele of Gaza - the director of Shifa Hospital, along with dozens of other terrorists, under the pretense that there was no space in prison for them,' he added. In recent days, there have been reports of investigations into associates of Netanyahu. An IDF officer and Netanyahu advisor was arrested by the Shin Bet for allegedly leaking classified military intelligence to foreign media, in what investigators claim was an attempt to influence opinion about the hostage negotiations. Another Netanyahu associate is under investigation for allegedly blackmailing a senior IDF commander, in order to force that officer to change the transcripts of conversations held in the Prime Minister's office in the early hours of the October 7th massacres. Prime Minister Netanyahu has strenuously denied the allegations, calling them 'an organized hunting expedition designed to harm the country’s leadership and weaken us in the midst of a war.'

Hamas terrorists plotted to assassinate Israeli minister Ben Gvir...	The terror cell wasn't able to obtain firearms but built explosives, including a car bomb, to kill Ben Gvir and his son. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News ISA and members of Judea and Samaria police have revealed that terrorists with ties to Hamas plotted to assassinate National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and his son Shovael. The terrorists, who have been apprehended, attempted to gather information about the minister's locations, vehicle, and other data. They were also planning to murder his son Shovael Ben-Gvir, who has been active on social media on the topic of prisoners and rules of engagement with terrorists. The terrorists also had been tracking Shovael, who lives in Hebron, and had been logging security details. The Hamas cell wasn't able to obtain firearms but built explosives, including a car bomb, to kill Ben Gvir and his son. The case is currently is awaiting indictment at the State Prosecutors office. In April, Arab residents of eastern Jerusalem who pledged allegiance to the ISIS terror group and were planning to travel overseas for military training were arrested by the Israeli police, according to a statement from the authorities. The three men, all in their 20s, were planning a series of terror attacks against high-profile targets in the Jerusalem area. The cell had originally planned to build and detonate explosives in a mass casualty attack but, due to logistical issues, had decided to pursue shooting attacks instead. Possible locations scouted for the attack were Teddy Stadium, the largest soccer arena in Jerusalem, and a police station. One of the men arrested had been trained by ISIS operatives abroad and was encouraging the other two men to travel to a foreign country in order to learn terror tactics. An indictment was filed against the defendants in the Jerusalem District Court on the same day that details of the plot were made public.

Israel to deliver Arrow 3 missile defense system to Germany by 20...	This marks the first time that the Arrow 3 system will be deployed outside of Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's Defense Ministry is working with its German counterpart to deliver the Arrow 3 missile defense system to Germany by 2025. In addition to the two countries' defense ministries, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and the Israeli defense company Elbit Systems, along with MBDA Deutschland GmbH, are involved in the deal. The United States and Israel developed the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems to detect, intercept, and eliminate long-range ballistic missiles. Although Germany has stopped its sale of weapons to Israel amid controversy over the Gaza war, it nonetheless is preparing to purchase Arrow 3 from Israel for $3.5 billion. This marks the first time that the Arrow 3 system will be deployed outside of Israel. According to the deal, the Arrow 3 system will be delivered to Germany in 2025, but there is some indication it could be deployed earlier than that. Germany and other European countries are seeking to boost their defense systems amid concerns over the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Arrow plays a pivotal role in Israel's defense system, along with Iron Dome, which deals with shorter-range threats such as rockets, and David's Sling, which intercepts mid-range missiles. Arrow 2 is focused on dealing with long-range ballistic missiles, whereas Arrow 3 neutralizes missiles before they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. The effectiveness of the Arrow system in fending off Iran's missile and drone attack on Israel in April prompted other countries to become interested in purchasing Israel's missile defense system. In November 2023, Israel's Defense Ministry said, 'The Arrow-3 missile defense system constitutes the forefront of global technology, designed to intercept exo-atmospheric ballistic missiles. The Arrow-3 system also carried out its first operational interception during the Swords of Iron Operation, successfully destroying a target launched towards Israel in the Red Sea region. ' The IAI is the main contractor for Arrow 3's development and production, as well as its interceptions and radar detection system; Elbit is the command and control system developer. Tomer and Rafael Advanced Systems are subcontractors for developing and producing the Arrow-3 interceptor.

Israel eliminates senior Hezbollah terrorist who helped murder Le...	Ayyash was involved in the 2005 suicide truck bombing that killed former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An Israeli strike eliminated Salim Ayyash, a senior Hezbollah terrorist who assisted in the assassination of Lebanon's Prime Minister in 2005. On Sunday, al-Arabiya reported that Salim Ayyash, who was given five life sentences in absentia, was dead. Ayyash was involved in the 2005 suicide truck bombing that killed former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri. In 2020, an international tribunal gave Ayyash five concurrent life sentences. The US had offered up to $10 million in information leading to the arrest and capture of Salim Ayyash. On social media, it was reported that the strike that killed Ayyash took place al-Qusair area on the Syria-Lebanon border. The strike killed 21 others, including former Lebanese Minister of Economy and Trade Bassel Fleihan, and wounded 226. Last Thursday, 60 Hezbollah terrorists were killed by Israeli airstrikes on 20 targets north of the Litani River in Lebanon, including the area of Baalbek. The IDF destroyed the rocket launcher used in an attack against Israel on Wednesday, the most significant attack on central Israel since the war began. The IDF also neutralized weapons storage areas and terrorist infrastructure. Strikes were also conducted on Hezbollah targets in Nabatieh and the Dahieh area south of Beirut on Wednesday, according to the IDF. Among the targets hit in Dahieh, a Hezbollah stronghold, were command centers, weapons storage facilities and terror infrastructure, according to the military. 'All of the targets were embedded in the heart of a civilian area, an additional example of Hezbollah's cynical exploitation of Lebanese civilians as human shields,' the IDF said. 'Prior to the strikes, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk to civilians, including using precise munitions, surveillance, and issuing warnings to the population in the area.' According to Lebanese media reports, slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's uncle and his family were killed by an Israeli strike in Southern Lebanon on Wednesday. Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike on his bunker in Beirut on Sept. 27.

IDF chief: 2,000 terrorists killed, captured in Jabalia	Israeli forces killed dozens of terrorists in Jabalia over the past 24 hours, the IDF said on Sunday morning. By Joshua Marks, JNS One thousand Hamas terrorists have been killed and another thousand captured in Jabalia over the past three weeks, Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said on Friday. Speaking during a situational assessment in the northern Gaza city, Halevi said it was a 'significant achievement that deals Hamas a severe blow.' The IDF launched a major operation in the city in early October, following indications of a Hamas resurgence there. Israel, said Halevi, was 'sending Hamas a very clear message: The IDF does not tire. The more we fight, the stronger we become, gaining more experience, capabilities, professionalism, values and determination. We are progressing with great intensity.' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi (right) speaks to commanders during a situational assessment in Jabalia, northern Gaza, on Oct. 8, 2024. Credit: IDF. The IDF’s efforts in Gaza were sending a message to the entire Middle East, he continued. 'We are providing the residents near the northern Gaza border with greater security and creating conditions for this security to endure, to not be fleeting,' Halevi said. 'Reaching an agreement is complex, but with the strength you are displaying here and the powerful way in which the IDF is fighting on seven fronts, in seven arenas, Israel is telling the entire Middle East there is immense strength here, and incredible capability.' He reiterated the IDF’s support for the hostages being held by Hamas, both military and civilian, saying, '[We are] prepared to fight with tremendous determination, as well as pay a price to bring them home.' The military effort in Gaza was 'not stopping or slowing down,' he said. 'This is to bring back the hostages, to ensure security for the surrounding communities,' he said. Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 97 it kidnapped during the terror group’s Oct. 7, 2023, onslaught on the northwestern Negev. Israeli forces killed dozens of terrorists in Jabalia over the past 24 hours, the IDF said on Sunday morning, as well as dismantling terror infrastructure and a weapons storage facility. Weapons were also located in a tunnel shaft, according to the statement. Israeli forces also eliminated Hamas forces in Beit Lahia to the north of the city during the same period, as well in Rafah in southern Gaza. IDF exposes Hamas’s abuse of Gaza civilians The IDF on Sunday published disturbing visual documentation of Hamas terrorists torturing Gazan civilians. The videos, which were obtained by soldiers during ground operations in the Gaza Strip, show scenes of severe physical and psychological abuse from the years 2018 to 2020, including one hooded victim being hanged upside down by his feet while being interrogated.

Hamas is not only Israel’s enemy—they’re Gaza’s enemy also. pic.twitter.com/J4kasDlOCu &mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) November 10, 2024 'The materials uncovered, expose Hamas’s brutal methods for interrogating civilians, violating human rights, and systematically oppressing residents suspected of opposing the organization’s rule,' the IDF said. According to the army, the videos were kept by members of the terrorist group’s security apparatus. They document Hamas activities at Outpost 17 in the Gaza Strip, where brutal interrogations of civilians suspected of opposing Hamas were conducted. 'These materials reveal the Hamas terrorist organizations methods of governing the Gaza Strip, enforcing terror, harming Gaza’s vulnerable civilians and infringing on their freedom of expression,' the IDF said.

J.D. Vance was a poster boy for Yale law school, the school won’t...	The silence from the law school is conspicuous given the outsized role Yale played in Vance's life. By Aaron Sibarium, The Washington Free Beacon The day after Hillary Clinton was nominated by the Democratic National Committee in 2016, Yale Law School congratulated Clinton, class of 1973, 'on her historic nomination for President of the United States.' Eight years later, it is refusing to congratulate J.D. Vance on his actual election. The school has made no statement about the vice president-elect, who graduated from Yale Law in 2013, since he and Donald Trump scored a landslide victory on Tuesday. And according to Debra Kroszner, the law school’s chief of staff, it doesn’t plan to. Kroszner told the Washington Free Beacon that the school would include 'this news' in the next issue of its alumni magazine—which is only published twice a year—but would not congratulate Vance publicly, citing a new policy against issuing institutional statements. She declined to direct the Free Beacon to the text of that policy or explain why congratulating alumni would violate it. In just the past 10 days, the law school has publicly recognized three alumni, including federal judges from both parties, for their accomplishments, and promoted the work of a student group devoted to 'immigrant justice.' Yale Law also stayed mum when Vance secured the vice presidential nomination in July and was elected to the Senate in 2022. By contrast, Ohio State University, Vance’s undergraduate alma mater, congratulated him on Wednesday hours after the race had been called. The silence from the law school is conspicuous given the outsized role Yale played in Vance's life. The son of a single mother addicted to heroin, Vance burst onto the scene in 2016 with a best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, that grew out of a paper he wrote at Yale Law. There he met Usha Chilukuri, his future wife, and Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist who would bankroll his 2022 Senate campaign. He also chafed at what he saw as the school’s elite monoculture, developing the beginnings of a populist critique that would define his political career. 'Despite Yale’s transformative role in his life,' the New York Times wrote in July, 'Vance’s relationship with the school could be summed up as conflicted.' The law school’s relationship with its conservative alumni could be summed up the same way. On the one hand, Yale Law maintains ties to right-of-center judges and has congratulated conservative alumni, including Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, in the past. But it has also taken flack for those encomia—students and faculty derided the school’s praise for Kavanaugh after he was accused of sexual assault—and has become more reticent to honor figures deemed objectionable by the school’s activist class. The double standard has manifested in which alumni have, and don’t have, their portraits displayed in the law school. In 2018, Yale Law School commissioned a painting of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas with funding from Harlan Crow, the Texas billionaire, who donated over $100,000 for the portrait. Six years later, it has not been hung up. The law school does display paintings of Sonia Sotomayor, Barack Obama’s first Supreme Court nominee, and Stacey Abrams, the Democratic lawmaker who refused to concede the 2018 Georgia governor’s race, in its largest classroom. Other portraits include Abe Fortas, the former Supreme Court justice who resigned in 1969 amid allegations of corruption. Two conservative student groups, Yale Law Republicans and the Yale Federalist Society, are now asking the law school to add a painting of Vance, who, at 40, will become one of the youngest vice presidents in history. 'Vice President-elect Vance has distinguished himself as a Yale Law alumnus and exemplifies the best of the next generation of conservatives,' the groups wrote in a letter to Heather Gerken, the law school’s dean. 'We hope the Yale Law School administration will join us in congratulating Vice President-elect Vance and honor this extraordinary achievement by commissioning a portrait at the law school, as it has done for many distinguished alumni.' Thus far, the only acknowledgment of Vance’s victory has come from the university, not the law school. The Nov. 7 edition of Yale Today, a daily newsletter, linked to a USA Today story about the incoming vice president, adding a short blurb—'JD Vance ‘13 J.D. elected one of the youngest vice presidents in U.S. history'—that did not explicitly congratulate him. There is little love lost between Vance and his alma mater. In Hillbilly Elegy, he described feeling like an 'awe-struck tourist' when he arrived at Yale. But by 2021, the enchantment had worn off. After law school administrators were caught pressuring a student to apologize for his use of the term 'traphouse'—a scandal that became national news and briefly imperiled Gerken’s deanship—Vance told the Free Beacon that Yale Law was betraying its mission. 'The only reason this institution exists is to promote interesting thinking,' he said. 'What it actually does is train people to be boring and provincial thinkers who harass other people for having original thoughts.' The post J.D.

Netanyahu acknowledges responsibility for Hezbollah pager blasts	Israel never officially claimed responsibility for the attack, nor has it been clarified exactly how and when the devices were sabotaged. By Pesach Benson, TPS Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Israeli responsibility for Hezbollah’s exploding communications gear in September during Sunday’s Cabinet meeting. The meeting, the first since the dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Netanyahu said many senior political and security figures opposed the operation, as well as the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah blew up on Sept. 17 and 18, killing 42 people and injuring an estimated 3,500 people, mostly Hezbollah operatives. Israel never officially claimed responsibility for the attack, nor has it been clarified exactly how and when the devices were sabotaged. Presumably alluding to Gallant, Netanyahu said, 'When I wanted to eliminate Nasrallah, enter Rafah and other things – there were those who opposed it in the cabinet. One of the claims was the reluctance of the United States to cooperate. I did not agree and went all the way. There are insiders and outsiders who lie about the deal to release hostages. They lie about the families.' Gallant’s firing led to a shuffling of Cabinet positions, with Israel Katz becoming Defense Minister and Gideon Sa’ar becoming Foreign Minister. The two are tasked with spearheading Israel’s multi-front war and diplomacy against Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran and Tehran’s proxies in Yemen, Iraq and Syria. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Kamala Harris’s support for Israel did not harm failed presidenti...	The data seems to undermine the notion that Harris suffered electoral consequences over the Biden administration’s perceived support for Israel. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner US Vice President Kamala Harris’s expressed support for Israel had minimal impact on her failed 2024 presidential campaign, according to new data released by a Democratic-aligned analytics firm. Voters largely rejected Harris and supported newly minted President-elect Donald Trump due to the Biden administration’s record on inflation and immigration, according to Blueprint, a self-described 'public opinion research initiative.' Perception of Harris as 'too pro-Israel' ranked among the lowest concerns that the electorate had with the Democratic presidential nominee. Among 'all voters,' regardless of their political views, the prompt 'Kamala Harris is too pro-Israel' received a 'relative importance score' of -22, making it one of the bottom three 'reasons to not choose' Harris. The same prompt received a score of -24 and -30 by self-described 'swing voters' and 'swing voters' who ultimately 'chose Trump,' respectively. The scores were calculated by presenting respondents with random pairs of potential reasons to vote against Harris and asking them to select which reason they found more compelling. According to Blueprint, the 'strength of each criticism was measured by how frequently it was chosen when presented as part of a pair. The relative importance is how much more it was selected than the average criticism.' In other words, the criticism that Harris 'is too pro-Israel' was selected 28 percent of the time, so it has a relative importance of -22. Only the criticisms that Harris is 'too conservative' and 'isn’t similar enough to [incumbent President] Joe Biden' were chosen fewer times. The criticisms chosen most often were that 'inflation was too high under the Biden-Harris administration,' 'too many immigrants illegally crossed the border under the Biden-Harris administration,' and Harris 'is focused more on cultural issues like transgender issues rather than helping the middle class.' Despite the insistence that the Israel-Hamas war would cost Harris votes from progressives and ethnic minorities, the poll suggests that Black and Latino voters were largely indifferent to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The prompt 'Kamala Harris is too pro-Israel' received a 'relative importance score' of -14 from Black voters and -20 from Latino voters, landing in last place among all 25 reasons to not choose Harris offered by the data analytics firm. Notably, according to Blueprint, voters were somewhat more likely to vote against Harris for being 'too pro-Palestine.' Harris’s perceived support for the Palestinians received a score of -13 from all voters. The prompt received a -14 from both self-described swing voters and swing voters who backed Trump. Black and Latino voters were also more likely to reject Harris over a perception of the vice president being too 'pro-Palestine.' The prompt received a score of -12 from Black voters and -13 from Latino voters. The data seems to undermine the notion that Harris suffered electoral consequences over the Biden administration’s perceived support for Israel. Upon launching her presidential campaign in July, Harris was immediately flooded with demands by left-wing activists to adopt an adversarial posture toward the Jewish state. The Israel-Hamas war quickly emerged as a focal point within the Harris campaign, with the vice president repeatedly bemoaning the 'unacceptable' number of casualties in Gaza. Harris also made several overtures to pro-Palestinian forces within the Democratic coalition, such as holding secret meetings with Arab American leaders. Despite the emergence of a high-pressure campaign against Israel on social media and news outlets, polls suggest that overwhelming shares of Americans support Israel over Hamas and believe the Jewish state should continue its defensive military operations until it achieves its security goals.

Hezbollah rocket wounds three in Western Galilee	Two of the victims, aged 37 and 20, were listed in moderate condition, and the third victim, age 47, was in fair condition. By Joshua Marks, JNS Three Israelis were wounded on Sunday by a rocket strike in the Western Galilee during the latest barrage fired by Hezbollah in Lebanon. Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya said that the men arrived independently at the hospital after being injured by a rocket in the area of Kibbutz Kabri, around 2.5 miles east of the seaside city. They are residents of the nearby Arab village of Sheikh Dannun. Two of the victims, aged 37 and 20, were listed in moderate condition, and the third victim, age 47, was in fair condition. Fifteen rockets were fired from Lebanon at the Western Galilee on Sunday afternoon, according to the IDF, which said that some of the rockets were intercepted, while impacts were identified. Hezbollah rockets triggered sirens in the Upper and Western Galilee areas on Sunday morning, with a direct hit destroying a dining hall in Tel Hai, which is part of the border kibbutz of Kfar Giladi. No injuries were reported in the barrage, with video showing extensive damage to the inside of the building from the rocket impact. חדר האוכל נחרב: פגיעה ישירה בתל חי במטח האחרון מלבנון | תיעוד@guyvaron צילום: עמרי סבר pic.twitter.com/Fk31AsvoKI &mdash; החדשות - N12 (@N12News) November 10, 2024 Ten rockets fired from Lebanon crossed into Israel, with some of the projectiles intercepted and the rest striking open areas, the IDF said. Sirens also sounded in Moshav Margaliot, near Kiryat Shmona, in the afternoon. Earlier on Sunday, a drone launched from Iraq was intercepted before crossing into Israel, with fragments from the UAV falling in an open area in the Golan Heights, setting off sirens. On Saturday, the Lebanese terrorist group fired more than 70 projectiles into Israel. No injuries were reported. A rocket struck near a house in the evacuated border town of Metula, causing damage. IAF hits targets in Tyre, Baalbek The Israeli Air Force eliminated dozens of Hezbollah terrorists over the past 24 hours, striking dozens of targets across Lebanon, including in the Tyre and Baalbek areas, the IDF said. During a raid on a weapons storage facility on the outskirts of a village in Southern Lebanon, troops discovered a mobile missile launcher loaded with 24 rockets aimed at the Galilee, the army said on Saturday. The launcher was hidden in dense bush and connected to a civilian structure.

Trump and Israeli PM see ‘eye to eye’ on Iran – Netanyahu	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken with President-elect Donald Trump three times already since election day regarding the threat posed by Iran, Netanyahu reveals. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoke with former President and President-elect Donald Trump about Iran three times since election day last week, Netanyahu revealed in a video statement. Addressing Israeli citizens in Hebrew, Netanyahu Israel would 'continue to defend our state and our citizens in every arena, against any threat, especially the Iranian threat,' adding that the incoming president sees 'eye to eye' with him on the issue. 'In recent days, I have spoken three times with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.' 'These were very good and important talks designed to further enhance the steadfast bond between Israel and the US. We see eye to eye on the Iranian threat in all its aspects, and on the dangers they reflect.' 'We also see the great opportunities facing Israel, in the area of peace and its expansion, and in other areas.' Regarding the mob violence against Israeli Jews visiting Amsterdam Thursday night for a soccer match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the AJAX soccer club, Netanyahu compared the attacks to Kristallnacht, the anniversary of which was observed over the weekend. 'We will never allow the atrocities of history to recur. We will never capitulate to antisemitism or terrorism,' Netanyahu said. 'A clear line connects the two antisemitic attacks against Israel that we have seen recently on Dutch soil: The reprehensible legal assault against the State of Israel at the International Court in The Hague, and the violent assault against Israeli citizens on the streets of Amsterdam.' 'In both cases, there was dangerous antisemitism, the goal of which was to render helpless the Jews and their state, to deny our state the right of self-defense and to deny our citizens their very right to life.' 'Yesterday we marked Kristallnacht, which occurred 86 years ago in Europe. It was a brutal and violent assault against Jews just because they were Jews. Unfortunately, in recent days we saw pictures that recalled that night. On the streets of Amsterdam, antisemitic rioters attacked Jews, Israeli citizens, just because they were Jews.' 'But there is one great difference between that night and our time: Today we have a state, government and army of our own. We have the ability, the readiness and the determination to defend ourselves and to demand that others carry out their responsibilities. This is exactly what we have done.' Netanyahu discussed his phone call with his Dutch counterpart, Dick Schoof, who said he was 'ashamed' that the attacks took place in the Netherlands.

‘Shut it down for Palestine’ – Activists plan to disrupt Armistic...	Far-left group Youth Demand is planning 'highly coordinated, highly organized disruption on a nationwide level.' By World Israel News Staff Far-left activists are planning to disrupt ceremonies commemorating Armistice Day throughout the United Kingdom in order to protest the Israeli war against the Hamas terror group, a bombshell investigation revealed. Armistice Day, marked annually on November 11th, is a holiday commemorating the end of World War I and honoring the sacrifices of soldiers who were killed during the conflict. In the UK, military parades and memorial ceremonies typically attract thousands of spectators and participants. But this year, anti-Israel protesters are planning to 'shut it down for Palestine,' far-left group Youth Demand wrote on their Telegram channel. UK outlet The Express obtained footage of the group's leadership bragging about planned large-scale disruption of Armistice Day events. 'With five cities across the country, Youth Demand will be getting out onto the roads, swarming, causing disruption [and] getting away before arrests are made, hopefully,' Youth Demand activist Arthur Clifton said during a meeting with 50 local organizers held last week, according to The Express report. Clifton then stressed that Youth Demand is planning 'highly coordinated, highly organized disruption on a nationwide level.' The activists are 'trying to hijack what is a national memorial event that is commemorating Muslim soldiers, Hindu soldiers, Christian soldiers, or soldiers of no faith whatsoever who have laid their lives down so that people can protest,' ex-senior military intelligence officer Philip Ingram told GB News. Protests which would disrupt Armistice Day events are an 'absolute disugting mess,' Tony Hayes, chairman of the Veterans Association, told Talk Radio. The reports about the potential demonstrations 'get [him] extremely angry,' he added. 'At the end of the day, these are the soldiers who fought for this country over generations, and we are paying homage to that.'

Anti-Israel ICC prosecutor investigated for sexual harassment	Whistleblower documents indicate that top ICC prosecutor 'sexually touched' a female aide during work trip. By World Israel News Staff An International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor who requested arrest warrants against senior Israeli officials is facing an external investigation into his ongoing sexual harassment of a female aide. British attorney and head ICC prosecutor Karim Khan is seeking arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ex-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, claiming that there is sufficient evidence to charge them with war crimes. The ICC has yet to officially rule on whether or not it will fulfill Khan's request, which also included warrants for now-dead Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh. In April 2024, several weeks before Khan announced he was seeking the warrants, a female aide told coworkers that Khan had repeatedly sexually harassed her. AP reported that several incidents had occurred while Khan and the woman often traveled internationally together for work. 'During one foreign trip, Khan allegedly asked the woman to rest with him on a hotel bed and then 'sexually touched her,' according to whistleblower documents shared with the court’s watchdog' group, AP reported. 'Later, he came to her room at 3 a.m. and knocked on the door for 10 minutes.' He also placed his hands in the woman's pocket and repeatedly pestered her to go on vacation with him, she told her colleagues. The woman declined to file a formal complaint with the ICC's internal watchdog, citing her fears that the probe by would be biased in Khan's favor. Indeed, the ICC's internal investigation into Khan's behavior was closed in just five days. But now, according to AP, the ICC is seeking to have an external law firm or the police investigate the woman's claims. Notably, Khan isn't the first high-profile member of his family to face allegations of sexual misconduct. Khan's brother Imran, who once served as an MP for the UK Conservative party, was forced to resign in disgrace after being convicted of groping a teenage boy.

Trump to impose new sanctions on Iran, targeting nuclear program ...	President-elect Donald Trump to restore 'maximum pressure' policies against Iran, officials say, after Iran allegedly plotted to assassinate the former president. By World Israel News Staff Former President and President-elect Donald Trump is planning to return the U.S. to the 'maximum pressure' strategy against Iran which the White House pursued during the four years of his first administration, former U.S. officials told The Wall Street Journal. During his first term in office, Trump imposed new sanctions on Tehran and withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - on May 8, 2018, restoring the sanctions regime suspended under the 2015 agreement. In addition, the president pursued what he called a broader strategy of 'maximum pressure' on Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, its ballistic missile program, and its support for terrorist proxy forces including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Yemenite Houthis. The Trump administration targeted the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), designating the organization as a terrorist group in April 2019, and assassinating Qassem Soleimani, commander of the IRGC's overseas Quds Force on January 3rd, 2020. Now, according to former Trump administration officials, the president-elect is poised to resume his policy of 'maximum pressure,' targeting Iran's nuclear program as well as its support for terrorist groups involved in ongoing wars with Israel and attacks on Red Sea shipping. According to the former administration officials, Iranian plots to assassinate Trump have further fueled his plans to confront Tehran. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Justice charged three men for allegedly plotting to murder Trump, an Iranian-American human rights advocate, and a number of Israelis and other Jews. The plot was allegedly orchestrated by Iran and led by Iranian national Farhad Shakeri, who could face as much as 100 years in prison for the murder plot, money laundering, terrorism charges, and sanctions violations.

Maisa Abd Elhadi posted disturbing photo of gunmen kidnapping an elderly woman on October 7th, adding a caption with praise for the terrorists and laughing emojis. By World Israel News Staff An actress who posted gleefully about the October 7th massacres was officially released from home confinement last Thursday, more than a year after being arrested for incitement and supporting terror. Maisa Abd Elhadi, an Arab citizen of Israel from Nazareth, identifies as a Palestinian. She has long advocated against the Jewish State, despite finding professional success in Israel and appearing in several Hebrew-language films. On October 7th, 2023, Abd Elhadi posted photos of an elderly woman being kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on her Instagram account, adding the caption 'this lady is going on the adventure of a lifetime.' Posting another photo of Hamas terrorists posing with their octogenarian captive - later named as Yaffa Adar - Abd Elhadi wrote 'our guys are good,' along with laughing emojis. The following day, while Israeli security forces were still fighting terrorists in kibbutzim in southern Israel, Abd Elhadi posted a picture of a bulldozer taking down part of the Gaza border fence. 'Let's go, Berlin style!' she wrote underneath the image. A search of Abd Elhadi's phone after her arrest revealed that she had celebrated the October 7th terror onslaught. 'Girls, have you heard the good news?' Abd Elhadi wrote to friends in a group chat. Last Thursday, a judge officially ended Abd Elhadi's house arrest, but the charges against her - incitement and support for a terror organization - are still pending. The judge accepted the prosecution's request for Abd Elhadi to be banned from using social networks, except for the WhatsApp messaging application. Abd Elhadi's attorney, Abeer Baqer, claimed she has become the victim of death threats and that she was mistreated during the brief time she was held at a police station. 'She was arrested violently. And she was beaten while being detained,' Baqer told Hebrew-language news site Walla, without providing any evidence to back up those allegations. Abd Elhadi is 'in fear for her life' due to pervasive death threats on social media, Baqer claimed. When asked why Abd Elhadi has yet to file a police report regarding the alleged mistreatment she received while in custody or the death threats, Baqer said that he was 'working on it.'

Video footage of Hamas torturing Gaza civilians discovered	IDF uncovers trove of footage showing Hamas terrorists tormenting and physically abusing Gaza civilians who were suspected of opposing the organization. By World Israel News Staff Israel's military has uncovered footage taken by the Hamas terrorist organization of its operatives physically abusing and even torturing Gaza civilians taken captive for allegedly opposing the terror regime's rule of the Gaza Strip. An IDF spokesperson said the military and the Shin Bet internal security agency have discovered thousands of hours-worth of footage from closed-circuit television cameras documenting the abuse and torture of Gazans prior to the October 7th, 2023 invasion of Israel. Over the weekend, the Israeli military released 45 minutes of the footage, part of the treasure trove of video recordings taken at Hamas' Outpost 17 in the Jabalia refugee camp from 2018 to 2020. The recordings, which are part of the general security film records from the outpost, inadvertently included footage of Hamas terrorists. Hooded victims, tied up and left hanging from the ceiling, are seen in a number of videos, while their captors periodically whip or beat them. A senior Israeli military official told The Daily Mail that the videos were first uncovered in March, and that the sheer amount of footage has taken months for the army to document and process. 'The IDF found these CCTV images in March,' the official said. 'It took months to go through them all.' According to the Daily Mail, the victims seen being tortured in the videos include dissidents and suspected collaborators. Others tortured by Hamas terrorists in the videos were suspected homosexuals. One dissident, Hamza Howidy, 27, told the Daily Mail he had been held captive and tortured by Hamas in Jabalia in 2019. 'Hamas controls everything,' Howidy said. 'They confiscated my laptop and had issues with my conversations with my girlfriend. Collaborating with Israel would warrant a severe punishment and homosexuality would result in a death sentence.'

Trump calls on Biden to reach ceasefire between Israel and Hezbol...	The president-elect reportedly pressing the Biden administration to secure a ceasefire between Israel and the Hezbollah terror organization, after calling for an end to the war in Lebanon. By World Israel News Staff Former President and President-elect Donald Trump has called on the Biden administration to reach a ceasefire deal between Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon, the Israeli daily Yedioth Aharanoth reported Sunday morning. According to the report, after winning last Tuesday's presidential election, Trump 'sent a message' to the Biden White House, informing the outgoing administration that he expects to see progress towards a ceasefire deal in Lebanon before he takes office on January 20th. American officials cited in the report said that Trump's push for a ceasefire, combined with the efforts of President Joe Biden's envoy Amos Hochstein, have made the prospects for a deal between Israel and Hezbollah more likely. 'The chances of settlement in Lebanon under Hochstein's leadership - and with Trump's encouragement - are increasing,' one U.S. official told Yedioth Aharanoth. The sources cited by the report also said that the White House is continuing with its efforts to brokered a 'small hostage deal' between Israel and Hamas, despite recent reports claiming the Islamist terror group has refused to consider such an agreement. Over the weekend, the Qatari government announced that it will no longer serve as a mediator in hostage deal talks between Israel and Hamas. 'Qatar will renew its efforts with its partners when there is the necessary seriousness to end the war. In that case, all efforts will be made to end the war and return the hostages.' Qatar's Foreign Ministry said. The announcement came on the heels of reports by Israel's KAN broadcaster that Doha has decided it will cease hosting Hamas' leadership, ordering members of the terrorist group to leave the country. Qatar has hosted Hamas' senior leadership for the past 12 years, and has for years been the largest single donor to the Gaza Strip while it was under Hamas rule.

US issues ‘sharp’ warning to Israel as arms embargo deadline near...	Biden administration's 30-day deadline for policy changes in Gaza nearing, raising fears among Israeli officials that the lame duck White House is ready to go 'all the way' with sanctions against Israel. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration admonished Israel last Friday, issuing a 'sharp' warning regarding a memorandum demanding Israel make over a dozen policy changes in the Gaza Strip or else face an arms embargo, Israel's Channel 12 reported over the weekend. On Friday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke by phone with his new Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud), who last week replaced Yoav Gallant (Likud). The call marked the first conversation between the two since Katz became Defense Minister. According to Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, during the phone call, Austin Austin 'reaffirmed the United States' ironclad commitment to Israel's security and support for its right to defend itself,' while emphasizing to the Israeli defense minister the administration's demand that Israel work 'to improve the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza.' According to a report by Channel 12, however, Austin warned that the administration would restrict the transfer of military equipment to Israel, should it fail to implement the policy changes listed in a memo from the Biden administration last month. Sources cited by the report said Austin delivered a 'sharp' message, and that the Biden White House appears prepared to go 'all the way' with its threats of an arms embargo should Israel not implement all 15 of the changes demanded in the memo. The October 13th memo set out an ultimatum, with a 30-day deadline which will be reached this week, demanding that Israel commit to 15 steps aimed at increasing the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip, limiting the use of evacuation orders in Gaza, and ending what the administration dubbed the 'isolation of northern Gaza.' The letter also strongly urged Israel not to pass legislation banning the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).

White supremacist’s master plan to attack Nashville power grid go...	Text messages detailed in the complaint reveal Philippi allegedly told an undercover FBI agent in July that targeting 'high economic, high tax, political zones in every major metropolis' would cause maximum damage. By Jewish Breaking News A white supremacist has been arrested for plotting to attack a local energy facility in Nashville. Skyler Philippi, 24, was arrested Saturday in Nashville and charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted destruction of an energy facility, the U.S. Justice Department announced. He is being held without bond pending a Wednesday court appearance. His attorney has declined to comment on the charges. According to the federal criminal complaint, Philippi was driven by 'accelerationist ideology,' which is a white-supremacist belief that society is beyond repair and must be destroyed through violent means. 'Fueled by the perception that the White race’s future is bleak, these White supremacists believe they must employ any means necessary to expedite the collapse of the current system,' the Anti-Defamation League says of accelerationism. 'Solutions to bring down the system range from the most extreme form, violence, to deliberate political engagement that supports destructive and divisive societal elements.' Text messages detailed in the complaint reveal Philippi allegedly told an undercover FBI agent in July that targeting 'high economic, high tax, political zones in every major metropolis' would cause maximum damage. Philippi had studied previous attacks on power substations in North Carolina and California, concluding that firearms would be ineffective compared to his planned drone attack. Security experts cite the Nashville power grid plot as part of an escalating pattern of extremist activity. 'Electric utilities have always taken substation security seriously,' Patrick C. Miller, CEO of Oregon-based utility security consulting firm Ampyx Cyber, tells CNN. 'Historically, perceived or real differences with the administration have [changed from ‘has’] a tendency to drive extremist activity, and I expect that to get more fuel.'

By Jewish Breaking News In a powerful evening of testimony on November 3rd, Noa Argamani and Moran Stella Yanai, both released hostages, shared their harrowing journeys with over 2,000 members of the South African Jewish community. The event, organized by Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) in partnership with JNF-South Africa and The Base Synagogue, highlighting the ongoing plight of over 100 hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas. KKL-JNF, known for its global commitment to Israel and Jewish communities, collaborated with The Base Synagogue in Johannesburg to bring Noa and Moran to South Africa as part of a broader initiative to raise awareness and offer support to former hostages and their families. Both Noa and Moran expressed deep gratitude to JNF-South Africa for their commitment to raising awareness and supporting hostages and their families. Noa Argamani’s story gained global attention when she was abducted alongside her boyfriend, Avinatan Or, during the October 7th Nova Festival. Held for 245 days, Noa faced unimaginable trials, each day marked by fear. Released just weeks before her terminally ill mother’s passing, Noa described how the promise of seeing her mother again kept her alive. 'Every second in captivity, I held onto the hope of seeing my mother again,' Noa shared, her voice filled with emotion. 'I feared each day might be my last, but I had to endure—for my family, for Avinatan, who is still trapped in Gaza.' Noa’s release came through a daring Israeli rescue mission. 'Coming home was the happiest day of my life,' she said, though her joy is bittersweet with Avinatan still held captive. 'I’ll wait for Avinatan. I’ll wait for the day I can feel whole again.' Moran Stella Yanai, held hostage for 54 days, was subjected to extreme physical and mental abuse after being captured and sold to Hamas. Her strength and faith helped her survive the ordeal. 'I want you to think of all the hostages as strong and trust that those still inside will experience the same miracle I did,' she said. 'We have enough faith to survive in any situation.' Moran recalled the terror she faced during her capture. 'I had to run for five hours, hearing artillery fire around me. But I held onto faith, believing my family was also a hostage, like many others in Israel today,' she said. 'I was saved so many times that day. I had to see the miracles,' she reflected on her narrow escapes. 'I know it’s twisted to say ‘saved’ in this situation, but it’s the truth.' Michael Kransdorff, Chairman of JNF-South Africa, spoke of the vital importance of such gatherings, stating, 'The South African Jewish community stands united in support of Israel and the hostages. Our aim is not only to raise awareness but also to offer a safe space where survivors can heal and be heard. The resilience displayed by Noa and Moran is an inspiration to us all and a call to action to continue advocating for the release of those still held captive.' Through initiatives like the yellow ribbon campaign and global gatherings, KKL-JNF remains committed to supporting hostages and their families. This event underscored the need for international solidarity and renewed efforts to secure the immediate release of all hostages held captive by Hamas.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Qatar announced it is no longer playing the role of mediator between Israel and Hamas and is closing the terror group's offices in its country, KAN reports. Qatar, which mediated hostage and ceasefire proposals, says it will no longer assume this role until both sides in the conflict show a 'sincere willingness' to consider an agreement. This comes as Hamas rejected a short-term ceasefire and limited hostage release deal proposed in mid-October. In addition, Qatar announced that, absent active hostage and ceasefire negotiations, Hamas's office in the country 'serves no purpose,' and the terror group must leave the country. A senior American Administration official told Reuters on Friday that the US has informed Qatar that Hamas should no longer be allowed to have a presence in Doha given its rejection of the latest and previous ceasefire deals. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, 'After rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, its leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner. We made that clear to Qatar following Hamas's rejection weeks ago of another hostage release proposal.' 'Hamas is a terrorist group that has killed Americans and continues to hold Americans hostage,' a senior US administration official told CNN. 'After rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, its leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner.' KAN reported that Qatari officials told Hamas, 'You are not welcome here.' Qatar also indicated that the only reason Hamas was allowed to maintain a presence in the country was to facilitate ceasefire and hostage negotiations. However, Egyptian sources told the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar that hostage negotiations are still ongoing. Three Hamas officials denied that Qatar is dismissing Hamas from the country and claimed, 'The Israeli reports are completely baseless.'

El Al to operate rescue flights from Amsterdam on Shabbat	Following approval from Israeli chief Rabbis, El Al has suspended its policy of not operating on Shabbat and scheduled three rescue flights on Friday night and Saturday. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News To assist Israelis in Amsterdam following the violent riot at the football game Thursday night, El Al is announcing it is operating rescue flights from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv also on Shabbat. On Thursday, violent anti-Israeli rioters attacked Israelis, wounding at least ten. Until Friday afternoon, three Israelis were missing but were later located. Following approval from Israeli chief Rabbis, El Al has suspended its policy of not operating on Shabbat and scheduled three rescue flights on Saturday. According to Jewish law, Shabbat prohibitions can be suspended to save lives. The first of the free flights, which are offered at no charge, will leave Amsterdam at 2 pm and will arrive in Tel Aviv on Friday evening, and there will be two additional departures. The tickets are free to those who hold an El Al airline ticket or a ticket from another Israeli airline. The flights must be arranged through a customer service hotline: 03-9404040. In addition to the rescue flights, El Al has two additional flights from Amsterdam returning to Israel on Friday as part of their regular schedule. PassportCard Travel has announced that two planes with medical teams have been deployed to Amsterdam and has asked policyholders in Amsterdam to contact them with updates. Cellcom announced it was offering special phone packages for people staying in Amsterdam to stay in contact with their loved ones. Pelephone and Partner are providing similar offers to Israeli customers in Amsterdam. United Hatzalah's Psychotrauma and Crisis Response Unit has opened up a hotline for Israelis in Amsterdam affected by the violence. In addition, Israel's Health Ministry is providing emotional and psychological assistance to Israelis in Amsterdam and upon their return.

Watchdog drags State Department to court over Iran envoy scandal	CASA has also targeted the National Archives with legal action, seeking documents from Malley’s time as special assistant to President Obama during the 2015 Iran nuclear deal negotiations. By Jewish Breaking News The Center to Advance Security in America (CASA) has filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration, seeking to break through months of silence surrounding former US Iran envoy Robert Malley’s suspension. Malley, who was named as President Biden’s special representative for Iran in 2021, had long been instrumental in back-channel dealings with the Iranian government. He lost his security clearance in April 2023 after allegedly transferring classified documents to his personal email and cell phone, which were then stolen by an unidentified 'cyber actor.' A scathing September report from the State Department’s revealed senior officials had allowed Malley to maintain access to classified materials even after his suspension. More troubling, the report found evidence that department leadership actively worked to shield the situation from congressional oversight and public scrutiny, raising questions about a potential cover-up. In August 2023, shortly after Malley’s suspension became public, the *Tehran Times* published reports containing 'sensitive but unclassified' State Department documents, including one that outlined the reasons Malley had his security clearance revoked. A month later, the paper released audio recordings of National Security Council coordinator Brett McGurk discussing 'national security options towards Iran.' CASA has also targeted the National Archives with legal action, seeking documents from Malley’s time as special assistant to President Obama during the 2015 Iran nuclear deal negotiations. Despite identifying more than 200,000 relevant files in December, the Archives has yet to release a single document. According to the Washington Free Beacon, several of Malley’s protégés remain in sensitive positions. Most notably, his former protégé Ariane Tabatabai still holds a senior Pentagon position despite being unmasked as part of a shadowy Iranian influence operation called the Iran Experts Initiative. America First Legal launched separate legal action last month over the Biden administration’s obstruction of investigations into Tabatabai’s activities.

Man carrying weapons and protest manifesto against Gaza war tried...	Olson carried a manifesto and a letter to Congress, police said, adding, 'The letter was focused on the man’s opinions on the war in the Middle East.' By Andrew Lapin, JTA A Michigan man carrying a flare gun, a torch lighter, two bottles of fuel and a manifesto angry with the government’s response to the Israel-Hamas war was arrested at the United States Capitol Visitor Center on Election Day, police said. The man, 28-year-old Austin M. Olson of the Detroit suburb of Westland, was charged with possession of a prohibited weapon, unlawful activities, and disorderly conduct. In a release, U.S. Capitol Police noted he 'also smelled like he doused part of his clothing with fuel.' Olson carried a manifesto and a letter for Congress, police said, adding, 'The letter was focused on the man’s opinions on the war in the Middle East.' Officials told the New York Times that the letter 'appeared to claim that he was protesting the war in Gaza and the United States’ relationship with Israel.' The evidence suggested that Olson might have been planning to self-immolate, a form of protest that at least three other people have carried out in the U.S. in connection with the war in Gaza. In February a U.S. airman died after setting himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C., while shouting 'Free Palestine.' The man, Aaron Bushnell, had posted a video online declaring he 'will no longer be complicit in genocide' and became a folk hero among some pro-Palestinian activists. Bushnell’s death came nearly three months after a still-unknown protester engaged in a similar act at the Israeli consulate in Atlanta, where she suffered critical injuries. And a man was severely injured after lighting himself on fire outside the Israeli consulate in Boston in September. In the latest incident, the Times reported that a man who appeared to be Olson had an extensive record of political videos posted to YouTube and the far-right website Rumble, the last one of which he expressed his desire to be a martyr: 'If my persecution and death means the truth lives, I’ll pick up my cross.' On the social network Threads, the Anti-Defamation League gave a further breakdown of Olson’s views on Jews and Israel. 'He expresses a variety of antisemitic, anti-Israel & anti-government views, alleging that elected leaders serve the interests of Israel over the American people,' the ADL wrote, citing a quote from Olson: 'The problem is Israel; the problem is you. You have been bought and we have been sold into slavery and called it capitalism. Israel controls our media, our corporations, they control you and they own us.' The ADL’s Center on Extremism also noted that Olson’s account on the social network X 'expressed a range of far-right tropes and antisemitic views, including endorsing the Great Replacement Theory and the antisemitic myth of deicide.' Police did not release additional details about the manifesto’s contents. Olson had driven all night from Michigan to Washington, D.C., the night before. During a press conference immediately after the arrest, chief J. Thomas Manger told reporters that the suspect’s interest 'may have' been the war, but added there was 'no indication right now that it had anything to do with the election.'

On Election Day, Biden-Harris admin quietly waived terrorism sanc...	The waiver enables the Palestinian government to duck American sanctions for another 180 days, at which point it will come up for renewal once Trump is in the White House. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Just before Tuesday’s presidential election, the Biden-Harris administration quietly waived mandatory terrorism sanctions on the embattled Palestinian government—even as it determined that the government's leaders are paying imprisoned terrorists and fomenting violence in breach of U.S. law. The State Department, in a non-public notice to Congress, determined that the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) are not complying with agreements to curb terrorism against Israel and end the 'pay-to-slay' program, which rewards imprisoned terrorists for committing acts of violence. Those violations should trigger American sanctions, barring members of the Palestinian government from obtaining U.S. visas. The Biden-Harris administration nonetheless used its executive power to waive the sanctions. 'A blanket denial of visas to PLO members and PA officials, to include those whose travel to the United States to advance U.S. goals and objectives, is not consistent with the U.S. government’s expressed willingness to partner with the PLO and PA leadership,' the State Department told Congress in the private notification obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The agency issued the waiver just as Americans headed to the polls Tuesday to hand Donald Trump a decisive victory driven in part by the former president’s clear-cut commitment to Israel’s security amid a broadening regional war. The waiver enables the Palestinian government to duck American sanctions for another 180 days, at which point it will come up for renewal once Trump is in the White House. Most notably, the State Department determined the Palestinian government 'continued to make payments to the families of prisoners convicted of committing acts of terrorism and the families of individuals who were wounded or died while committing acts of terrorism, whom they dubbed ‘martyrs.’' The terrorist payment program has long been a flashpoint in U.S. relations with the Palestinians. Congress passed a law in 2018 prohibiting economic aid unless those payments are ended, but the Biden-Harris administration has skirted the law while in office, enabling millions of dollars to flow into projects bolstering the Palestinian government. The administration simultaneously pumped millions of dollars into the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip—even as officials privately warned of 'a high risk Hamas could potentially derive indirect, unintentional benefit from U.S. assistance to Gaza.' During the reporting period, which covers April 1, 2023, to September 30, 2023, the Palestinian government 'continued to utilize post office branches in Judea and Samaria and Gaza to facilitate payments to prisoners and families of ‘martyrs,’' also in violation of Israeli laws. 'Senior PA/PLO officials publicly defended the payments and criticized Israel’s withholding of clearance and tax revenues, which Israel claimed were withheld in an amount equivalent to prisoner/'martyr' payments made by the PA,' according to the State Department. The Palestinian government prioritized payments to terrorists in the face of a massive budget shortfall driven by lagging investments from Western nations. The PA owes more than $6 billion for past loans, putting it in a 'deep and substantial financial crisis,' but continues to pump millions into its 'pay-to-slay' program. An earlier State Department report showed the Palestinian government allocated more than $150 million to imprisoned terrorists in 2019, with another $191 million given to the families of terrorists who were 'martyred' while attacking Israel. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas was also found to have incited violence against Israel during the reporting period, violating U.S. agreements that should trigger sanctions. Abbas, the State Department said, 'stoked outrage after news broke that he had delivered a speech featuring antisemitic tropes in late August. The comments included claims that Ashkenazi Jews were not descended from ancient Israelites and that Hitler murdered Jews in the Holocaust because of their ‘role in society, which had to do with money.’' Still, the Biden-Harris administration determined that Abbas remains committed to 'nonviolence, a two-state solution, and previous PLO commitments, including recognition of the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace.' Other Palestinian government officials 'made statements that honored terrorists that killed Israelis and often remained silent following terrorist attacks inside Israel.' In other instances, they offered 'praise and glorification' of Palestinian terrorists and named West Bank schools in honor of those who committed violence. The Palestinian government’s two largest terror arms—the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)—also continued to launch attacks on Israel throughout the reporting period. The PFLP, for instance, orchestrated missile attacks from Lebanon and coordinated with Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip. The DFLP also claimed 'responsibility for some of the rockets fired from Gaza into Israel.'

In video, Hamas terrorists discuss a hostage while watching Israe...	The six hostages were believed to have been used as human shields by Yahya Sinwar. In a video discovered by the IDF in the Gaza tunnel where 6 hostages were executed in August, Hamas terrorists are watching demonstrations on television and discussing an Israeli hostage. The video shows Hamas terrorists watching hostage demonstrations on Al Jazeera and recognizing the image of one of the hostages murdered in the tunnel, Almog Sarusi, held up at the demonstration. The video was published on Kan and was released with the permission of the Sarusi family. It was found on a flash drive recovered in the same tunnel the six hostages were held and murdered in the city of Rafah. תיעוד חדש ממנהרת החטופים: כך דיברו ביניהם המחבלים על החטוף שנרצח אלמוג סרוסי והמחאה בישראל@NOFARMOS #חדשותהערב pic.twitter.com/FI7BoPKS8h &mdash; כאן חדשות (@kann_news) November 6, 2024 The six hostages, believed to have been used as human shields for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, were executed in the tunnel as Hamas terrorists realized the IDF were approaching. The six hostages killed by Hamas in the tunnel are: Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23; Eden Yerushalmi, 24; Ori Danino, 25; Alex Lobanov, 32; Carmel Gat, 40, and Almog Sarusi, 27 In the video, the terrorists are not seen on the camera, but their voices are heard speaking in Arabic as they watch the demonstration on television. The two men said: 'Yes, there he is — Almog Sarusi,' one of them says, pausing the television report. 'Yes, he has long hair,' says the other. 'They set up a sort of encampment,' one of the voices adds. 'The ones who are lifting up the photos of [the hostages] — those are their families,' the other says. According to reports and DNA evidence, the six hostages who were executed in late August were used as human shields. Sinwar was eliminated by chance during an IDF operation in Rafah, not far away from where the six hostages were killed by their captors. When the IDF recovered the bodies of the hostages on August 31, they also discovered DNA from Sinwar indicating he had been in the area at some point between August 21 and August 27. Reports from early in the war that Sinwar was hiding in Gaza tunnels and using hostages as human shields, and the DNA, location, and reports connect the six slain hostages to Sinwar. The IDF had opportunities to assassinate Sinwar earlier in the war, but his use of hostages as human shields proved an obstacle to these operations.

IDF saves 1 million Gaza children from polio epidemic	517,000 vaccinations were administered in the south, 379,000 in central areas, and 211,000 in northern Gaza. By Jewish Breaking News While the mainstream media continuously accuses the Jewish state of genocide in Gaza, the truth once again paints a very different picture. Over 1 million polio vaccines have been successfully administered to children across Gaza through a coordinated effort between Israeli defense forces and international health organizations. The massive vaccination campaign, overseen by COGAT (Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories) in partnership with WHO and UNICEF, was strategically implemented across Gaza, with over 517,000 vaccinations administered in the south, 379,000 in central areas, and 211,000 in northern Gaza. Since 2022, polio vaccination coverage in Gaza had maintained a healthy rate of 95%. However, with Hamas using all available resources, including fresh water, to fuel its terror war against Israel, its citizens now face a very deadly disease. Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that has plagued humanity for centuries. It primarily spreads through contaminated water, food, or close contact with an infected person. While many infected individuals may not show symptoms, others can experience fever, fatigue, and limb pain. In severe cases, polio can damage the body’s nervous system, leading to paralysis. To enable this crucial health initiative, Israeli forces implemented tactical humanitarian pauses, allowing medical teams to safely distribute the vaccines. The operation went beyond mere vaccine delivery, as essential support infrastructure, including refrigeration equipment for vaccine storage and transportation, was also provided. Recent months have seen the delivery of enough polio vaccine vials to protect over 4.8 million civilians, along with additional vaccines against various diseases sufficient for 5.6 million people.'

Pro-Hamas Bernie bro elected to Dearborn school board	He finished second place in a crowded field running for two open seats on the school board, according to Wayne County election results. By Chuck Ross, The Washington Free Beacon Voters in Dearborn, Mich., a Muslim-American stronghold outside Detroit, have elected a former Bernie Sanders surrogate who defends the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah to serve on the city’s school board. Amer Zahr, a Dearborn-based activist, has urged Muslims to 'stand with' Hamas and Hezbollah and to stop 'condemning anti-Semitism.' In September, he lamented Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. 'No living Arab leader was more respected among the masses. And Israel murdered him,' Zahr said of Nasrallah, who U.S. officials have linked to thousands of American deaths. Now, Zahr will serve on Dearborn’s seven-member school board, which oversees 20,000 students in the Detroit suburb, home to the largest Arab and Muslim population in the country. He finished second place in a crowded field running for two open seats on the school board, according to Wayne County election results. 'I look forward to serving on our School Board! We have a lot of work to do. I promise to make you all proud!' Zahr said Wednesday. Zahr’s victory could reinforce Dearborn’s reputation as a hotbed of anti-Israel zealotry. One analyst dubbed the town 'America’s jihad capital' on account of the numerous imams and city leaders that 'side with Hamas against Israel and Iran against the U.S.' Chants of 'Death to Israel' and 'Death to America' have been heard at rallies this year in the Detroit suburb, including an event in September headlined by Dearborn’s mayor. Zahr frequently organizes anti-Israel events in Dearborn and neighboring cities. At a rally in 2017, Zahr stated that 'whether it's called Hamas, whether it's called Hezbollah, we stand with everybody who stands against the Israeli occupation.' In 2021, he urged activists who are 'condemning anti-Semitism and condemning terrorism' to 'stop it!' Zahr, who served on the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2020, is a prominent backer of the 'uncommitted' movement aimed at pressuring President Joe Biden to pull support from Israel in the war against Hamas. Zahr promoted the cause in an interview with the New York Times and said the opposition to Biden created an opportunity to increase Arab- and Muslim-American voters’ political influence. 'If he wins, no one will ever listen to us ever again. If he loses, we’ll probably have more political power than we’ve ever had before,' said Zahr, who described himself as a 'dues-paying member of the Democratic party.' Zahr has also spoken out against Vice President Kamala Harris over the Israel-Hamas war. Zahr landed an endorsement in the school board race from the Arab American News, a newspaper published by Dearborn community leader Osama Siblani. Like Zahr, Siblani has defended Hamas and Hezbollah while demonizing Israel. At the rally with Dearborn’s mayor in September, Siblani called Nasrallah a 'hero' and said that Israeli Jews would be sent 'back to Poland.' The Harris campaign, like the Biden campaign before it, has sent campaign officials to Dearborn multiple times to meet with Siblani in an attempt to curry his political support. Jewish groups condemned the campaign for courting Siblani, given his pro-Hamas and anti-Israel statements.

‘The world needs Israeli solutions’: Climate innovation amid conf...	Israel's circular water economy rests on the four pillars of water desalination, using the water in households, purifying the wastewater, and reusing the treated water in agriculture. By Pesach Benson, TPS Despite being at war for the last year, Israel continues to play a key role in the fight against climate change. The threats of climate change aren’t waiting for the October 7 war to end, and neither is Israel’s climate change sector. 'We have continued to promote climate change in Israel, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation. The fact that there is a war doesn’t mean that we have to decline our duties to continue preparing ourselves in Israel for the eventualities of climate change,' Gideon Behar, Israel’s Ambassador and Special Envoy for Climate Change and Sustainability, told The Press Service of Israel. 'So, continuous work is going on internally in Israel in regard to preparation, adaptation, and also mitigation.' Behar will be part of a 100-strong delegation of Cabinet ministers, scientists, businessmen and activists led by President Isaac Herzog attending the 29th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku. The gathering, which begins on Monday, aims to coordinate and advance efforts to combat climate change. 'The war has affected us in terms of regional cooperation with some of our neighbors. But still, we continue to do our utmost to work and to prepare the ground for regional cooperation,' Behar said. One of the more pressing issues of regional cooperation is the Mediterranean’s sea level, which Behar said has been rising at approximately a half-centimeter per year. 'In the Mediterranean region, there are many low-lying areas and many coastal cities,' Behar explained. 'That’s why we think that there must be a coordinated approach by all countries in the Mediterranean region to prepare ourselves to understand the magnitude of sea level rise and to coordinate the response,' explained. 'So it makes only sense that the countries in the larger Mediterranean region will cooperate and learn from one another and share information and know how to adapt themselves to the challenges.' Rising temperatures cause sea levels to rise through the melting of ice sheets and the thermal expansion of water. Water molecules spread out as they heat, which causes the volume of the ocean to increase. 'Sea level rise is accelerating and is considered to be one of the most significant challenges and threats of global warming.' Behar said. He noted that recent reports by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicate that 'by the end of this century there will be an approximately one-meter rise in sea level rise. And there are also possibilities that it will be higher if we do not reduce enough emissions.' Asked how President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House will affect the fight against climate change, Behar told TPS-IL, 'The United States is a vital ally. We’ll continue to cooperate with the United States in every aspect.' Israeli Innovation 'Israel is really a leading force in climate innovation and the world is in a greater and growing need for practical, applicable, and cheap solutions for the climate crisis, both to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also to create resilience and adaptation,' he stressed to TPS-IL. 'We are a country that has to deal with lack of water, with hostile climate, with agriculture in the desert. And we have gained lots of experience, which is very, very important in the world today.' One example is the country’s 'circular' water economy, 'which exists, as far as I know, only in Israel,' he told TPS-IL. He explained that this circular water economy rests on the four pillars of water desalination, using the water in households, purifying the wastewater, and reusing the treated water in agriculture. 'We hold a world record in purifying wastewater. We are the only country that treats around 95% of its wastewater,' Behar said. 'We hold another record in the prevention of water loss in water systems. We lose only a few percent of our water due to water leaks, whereas in most countries, water loss is a few dozens of percent. In some countries, they lose 50 percent of their water because of leaks.' Israeli insights can benefit most of the world. 'The northern Mediterranean is going through processes of desertification, and there is less water in the Balkans and in other countries in Europe. Or in the United States, which is going through a severe and accelerating water crisis. And India and in other places. So the world really needs Israeli ideas and Israeli solutions. And we are there, we are there to cooperate,' he said. 'I can promise you that the Israeli pavilion will be one of the most interesting ones in the COP because of the solutions, because of the innovation, because of the ideas, and because of the inspiration. People have to be inspired. This is a source of inspiration and hope.' Israel’s biggest challenge, he said, is the country’s lack of renewable energy sources. 'We do not have hydroelectric power, we do not have strong winds or strong waves in the sea or thermal power. The only source of renewable energy in Israel is solar,' Behar said. 'Now Israel is a very small country and it will not be a useful idea to cover all the open spaces with solar panels. We still need nature, we still need agricultural fields. So, efforts are being done today to see how we can, for instance, incorporate solar panels with agriculture. It is called photovoltaic. And some of the very interesting developments in this field are coming from Israel.' Said Behar, 'We have only one planet and that this planet has to be cherished, has to be taken care of, that we really have to rethink our behavior toward our planet.'

Iran plays down importance of US election, voices readiness for c...	The Revolutionary Guards did not directly react to Trump’s claimed electoral victory but said Tehran and its allied armed groups in the region are ready for confrontation with Israel. By Reuters and The Algemeiner Iranians’ livelihoods will not be affected by the US elections, government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani was reported as saying on Wednesday after Donald Trump claimed victory in the presidential vote. Arab and Western officials have told Reuters Trump may reimpose his 'maximum pressure policy' through heightened sanctions on Iran‘s oil industry and empower Israel to strike its nuclear sites and conduct assassinations. 'The US elections are not really our business. Our policies are steady and don’t change based on individuals. We made the necessary predictions before and there will not be change in people’s livelihoods,' Mohajerani said, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. The Revolutionary Guards did not directly react to Trump’s claimed electoral victory but said Tehran and its allied armed groups in the region are ready for confrontation with Israel. 'The Zionists do not have the power to confront us and they must wait for our response … our depots have enough weapons for that,' the Guards’ deputy chief Ali Fadavi said on Wednesday, as Tehran is expected to respond to Israel’s Oct. 25 strikes on its territory which killed four soldiers. The Israeli operation was a response to Iran’s direct ballistic missile attack on the Jewish state weeks earlier. Fadavi added Tehran does not rule out a potential US-Israel preemptive strike to prevent it from retaliating against Israel. In his first term, Trump re-applied sanctions on Iran after he withdrew from a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and world powers that had curtailed Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for economic benefits. The reinstatement of US.sanctions in 2018 hit Iran‘s oil exports, slashing government revenues and forcing it to take unpopular steps, such as increasing taxes and running big budget deficits, policies that have kept annual inflation close to 40 percent. Iran‘s national currency has weakened at the prospect of a Trump presidency, reaching an all-time low of 700,000 rials to the US dollar on the free market, according to Iranian currency tracking website Bonbast.com.

Israeli strikes deep in Lebanon kill 60 Hezbollah terrorists	According to Lebanese media reports, slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s uncle and his family were killed by an Israeli strike in Southern Lebanon on Wednesday. By Joshua Marks, JNS Sixty Hezbollah terrorists were killed over the past day in Israeli airstrikes on 20 targets north of Lebanon’s Litani River, including in Baalbek, the Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday morning. Among the targets hit was the launcher used in Wednesday’s rocket barrage on central Israel, the largest on the center since the war began over a year ago. Weapons storage facilities and terrorist infrastructure were also destroyed. Strikes were also conducted on Hezbollah targets in Nabatieh and the Dahieh area south of Beirut on Wednesday, according to the IDF. ביממה האחרונה, מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר, תקפו יותר מ-110 מטרות טרור של ארגוני הטרור חיזבאללה בלבנון וחמאס ברצועת עזה. בין המטרות שהותקפו על ידי חיל האוויר בלבנון, כ-20 מטרות במרחב בעלבכ ובצפון הליטני, בהן חוסלו כ-60 מחבלים>> pic.twitter.com/APkUpbvKxG &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 7, 2024 Among the targets hit in Dahieh, a Hezbollah stronghold, were command centers, weapons storage facilities and terror infrastructure, according to the military. 'All of the targets were embedded in the heart of a civilian area, an additional example of Hezbollah’s cynical exploitation of Lebanese civilians as human shields,' the IDF said. 'Prior to the strikes, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk to civilians, including using precise munitions, surveillance, and issuing advance warnings to the population in the area.' According to Lebanese media reports, slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s uncle and his family were killed by an Israeli strike in Southern Lebanon on Wednesday. Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike on his bunker in Beirut on Sept. 27. Israeli ground forces continued to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure in Southern Lebanon on Wednesday, including a weapons storage facility and a rocket launcher. Israel hits Hezbollah target at Beirut Airport In the early hours of Thursday morning, Israel conducted an airstrike on a Hezbollah target 'within yards' of runways at Beirut-Rafic Hariri Airport, according to The Daily Telegraph. According to the British newspaper, which published a video of the strike, up to three missiles were fired at a building located between two runways at Lebanon’s only international airport. The IDF had previously issued an evacuation notice for the area. The Telegraph noted that all scheduled passenger flights had departed or arrived prior to the attack. One of the 10 rockets launched at central Israel by Hezbollah shortly before noon on Wednesday hit a parking lot at Ben Gurion Airport, temporarily halting flights at the country’s main international airport. There were no injuries reported. The IDF said on Thursday morning that overnight the Israeli Air Force struck Hezbollah command centers and terrorist infrastructure sites in the Beirut area. במהלך הלילה, מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר, בהכוונה מודיעינית מדוייקת של אגף המודיעין, תקפו מפקדות ותשתיות צבאיות של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה בביירות. חיזבאללה ממקם את נכסיו בלב אוכלוסייה אזרחית כשיטת לחימה וזו דוגמא נוספת לניצול של חיזבאללה במרחב האזרחי בלבנון>> pic.twitter.com/qcC8UkIow9 &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 7, 2024 Hezbollah rocket kills Israeli soldier Hezbollah launched 170 projectiles into Israeli territory in total on Wednesday, one of which killed an IDF soldier in the country’s north.

Arab Israeli teens plotting bombing attacks arrested	Terror cell plotting bombing attacks inside Israel exposed, with two teenage Arab Israelis arrested. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli State Prosecutor's Office filed an indictment Thursday morning in the Central District Court against two Arab Israeli minors from the Triangle region east of the Sharon district and west of northern Samaria. The teenage suspects stand accused of conspiring to carry out terrorist attacks targeting Israeli security personnel. According to the indictment, the two suspects were recruited as part of a terror cell with the specific goal of executing attacks on behalf of an unidentified group. The indictment, submitted by the Central District Prosecutor’s Office, alleges that one of the minors was initially recruited in August 2023 to conduct terrorist attacks against Israeli security forces. As part of his training, the teenage terrorist received guidance in handling explosive materials and subsequently acquired chemicals, conducting experiments to prepare explosives. Together with other members of the cell, he attempted to make explosive substances and actively sought additional recruits, ultimately bringing in three more members, including the second indicted minor. The two minors reportedly accessed online materials related to bomb-making and terrorist tactics via social media platforms like TikTok and equipped themselves with tactical vests and communication devices. In further efforts to expand their cell, the two made contact with others, successfully recruiting another person into the group. The group met regularly at various locations, where they discussed their mission and even assigned each other operational code names. At one such meeting, one of the defendants reportedly presented a chemical substance and explained its potential use. In an attempt to produce explosives, the group mixed the chemical with another substance and ignited the combination, which reportedly produced smoke. The charges brought against the two minors include conspiracy to commit aggravated terror-related assault, unlawful use of weapons for terrorist purposes, and obstruction of justice. Alongside the indictment, the prosecution has requested that both minors remain detained until the end of legal proceedings due to the severity of their actions, which 'demonstrate their willingness, determination, and audacity to harm security forces.' The prosecution also emphasized the heightened risk posed by the defendants, especially given the current context of Operation Iron Swords, in which Israel is engaged in conflicts on multiple fronts, necessitating heightened caution regarding their detention status. The court has imposed a publication ban on most details of the case.

Settlement leaders and Israeli government minister hail Trump's election as an opportunity for Israel to apply sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff Leaders of the Israeli settlement movement in Judea and Samaria have joined a government minister in calling for the application of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, following President-elect Donald Trump's win in Tuesday's presidential election. Addressing the Knesset plenum Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) blessed Trump's victory, reciting the Shehecheyanu prayer and saying the time is ripe for Israel to apply sovereignty over Judea and Samaria and to achieve 'total victory' over Hamas. 'Let me open with blessings to the new president of America, Donald Trump.' 'Now this is the time for sovereignty, this is the time for total victory, this is the time for the State of Israel to pass the 'Death to Terrorists' legislation - all kinds of laws which I have no doubt that the new president will see eye-to-eye with us on them.' Ben-Gvir also retweeted his own comment from July, which read 'God Bless Trump,' commenting 'Yesssss.' Israel Ganz, chairman of the Yesha Council - which represents all Israeli towns across Judea and Samaria - and mayor of the Binyamin Regional Council, took to X/Twitter to call for annexing Judea and Samaria following Trump's victory. 'Time for sovereignty! One strong Trump. One Jewish state.' Ganz later called Trump's victory an historic 'opportunity for the settlement movement,' according to The Washington Post. Shai Alon, Mayor of the town of Beit El, north of Jerusalem in Samaria, called Trump's victory a 'Golden opportunity for the settlement enterprise.' 'This is the kind of opportunity we have never had before, to make every effort to expand in Judea and Samaria, to put an end to murderous terrorism here, and to continue Israeli construction' in Judea and Samaria.' 'This is the time to declare sovereignty over Judea and Samaria&#8230;There will not be two states between the Jordan and the sea.'

Republican National Committee spokeswoman Elizabeth Pipko defends Trump's vow to 'stop wars,' saying the president-elect is committed to Israel 'winning decisively' against Hamas, Hezbollah. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to 'stop wars' was not an ultimatum to Israel to halt the fighting against terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, a spokeswoman for the Republican party said Wednesday, rather it was a promise to ensure Israel achieves decisive victories in both arenas. Elizabeth Pipko, a 29-year-old former model turned Republican National Committee spokeswoman, who first rose to prominence with the Exodus Movement encouraging American Jews to join the Republican party, spoke with Israel's Channel 12 on Wednesday, following Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. During the interview, Pipko responded to reports that Trump has given Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a deadline for ending Israel's wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Early Wednesday morning, Trump made a victory speech in which he vowed to 'stop wars' rather than start them during his next four years in the White House. Pipko said that the president-elect is looking to end both wars and minimize further casualties, but emphasized that he supports an end to the fighting through 'decisive' Israeli victories. 'I would say he expects them to end it by winning it, one hundred percent, that’s how he always talks about ending wars,' Pipko said. 'Donald Trump always says he wants less innocent people to die — that is his stance whether we’re talking about the war in Gaza, whether we’re talking about Russia in Ukraine or anywhere else.' 'So I do believe he wants the war to end as soon as possible, like all rational people do, but he wants it to end with a decisive victory.' When asked whether Trump would be willing to wait should it take time for Israel to achieve a 'decisive victory,' Pipko pivoted, saying that the Biden administration had not acted in a 'decisive' manner. 'When it comes to ending a war in the Middle East and dealing with enemies like Iran or Hamas you have to be decisive, and I have not seen that from our leadership.' 'I think when you have American hostages — people forget to say that, American hostages — held for nearly a year, and you see your leaders deciding on their moves for foreign policy based on what would help them win an election, you end up with a lot of unnecessary bloodshed on your hands, and that’s what we’ve seen this last year.'

Soldier killed in rocket attack on northern Israel	Sgt. Ariel Sosnov (Sasonov), 20, was killed and three others were wounded in the Hezbollah attack. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF announced the death Thursday of Sgt. Ariel Sosnov (Sasonov), who was killed in a Hezbollah rocket attack while on duty in northern Israel the previous day. Sosnov was stationed near Moshav Avivim in the Upper Galilee, which had been targeted by the Hezbollah terror organization Wednesday among several evening barrages that also reached the Haifa bay area and Jordan Valley communities. The 20-year-old soldier served in the 605th Engineering Battalion of the 188th Armored Brigade. He was promoted one rank upon his death, as is the IDF custom. Three other soldiers were lightly injured in the same attack, the IDF said. Sosnov was the second Israeli killed in the aerial assaults on Wednesday. Sivan Sadeh, 18, lost his life in the fields of Kfar Masryk. He was discovered in his car, seemingly trying to take shelter there when the warning sirens wailed, but a rocket slammed into the earth just meters away and he was killed by the shrapnel. When the Iron Dome system calculates that an incoming missile will hit an open area, it does not fire an interceptor, as Israel does not have an unlimited number of them and they must be saved for populated locations. IDF actions against Hezbollah Wednesday included air strikes in the Nabatiya area in southern Lebanon in which the terrorists’ command and control centers and weapons depots were destroyed. Overnight, using precise intelligence information, the IAF then hit Hezbollah targets in the Beqaa Valley and Beirut, including command posts and military infrastructure. One of the airstrikes targeted a site near the Lebanese capital’s international airport. 'Hezbollah places its assets in the heart of the civilian population as a method of warfare, and this is another example of the terrorist organization's exploitation of the civilian space in Lebanon,' the IDF spokesperson said, regarding the Israeli operation. 'Before the attack, many steps were taken to reduce the chance of harming civilians, including advance warnings to the population in the area,' the spokesperson added. In the strikes on the northern valley that has long been a Hezbollah stronghold, the IDF said that it had killed about 60 terrorists in some 20 different places. In general, the army says, its attacks are part of its unrelenting effort to damage Hezbollah’s military capabilities 'and make it difficult for the organization to restore' them.

Freed Gaza hostage pens open letter to Donald Trump	Do everything to bring home the remaining hostages,' former Gaza captive Sapir Cohen, who met with Trump, writes in open letter to the new president-elect. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News An Israeli woman who was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists on October 7th and held captive in the Gaza Strip for nearly two months before being released in last year's hostage deal penned an open letter to President-elect Donald Trump, begging him to do 'everything' possible to secure the release of the remaining hostages. Sapir Cohen, a 29-year-old police officer, was abducted by terrorists from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th, along with her boyfriend, Sasha Trufanov, Trufanov's mother, and Trufanov's grandmother. Trufanov's father, Vitaly, was murdered in the attack. After 55 days in captivity, Cohen was released as part of the November 2023 hostage deal, while Trufanov's mother and grandmother were freed as a goodwill gesture by Hamas to Russia. Several weeks ago, Cohen met with former President Donald Trump, urging him to take action on behalf of the remaining captives, including her boyfriend Sasha, should he win the November election. On Wednesday, a day after the vote, Cohen penned an open letter, shared via X/Twitter and Instagram, urging the president-elect to keep the hostages' return a 'top priority' for the White House. 'President-elect Trump, I congratulate you on your election victory. I'm begging you, ensure that rescuing these hostages remains a top priority,' Cohen wrote. 'There are 101 hostages still being held captive by the Hamas terrorist organization, enduring relentless daily torture. Among them are seven American citizens who are denied their basic freedoms.' 'I was released after 55 days in captivity of suffering and starvation. 55 days of constant fear of being raped. I stayed in tunnels under harsh conditions.' 'I had to collect food scraps from the floor and sleep in the same room with ten Hamas terrorists. I tried with all my strength to help the hostages who were with me - some of them don't even know what happened to their family members, and these thoughts are killing them more and more each day. Eight of the hostages I met along the way are no longer alive.' 'President-elect Trump, please, I'm pleading you to maintain focus on the hostage crisis. They must not be forgotten. For each of them - women, men, elderly and two young children - any day could be their last. We must do everything in our power to bring them home now.' Since her release last November, Cohen has publicly lobbied for efforts to secure the return of the remaining hostages. In late August, Cohen addressed a gathering at Yeshiva University in New York City, recalling her own captivity in Gaza.

Israel inks $5 billion deal for advanced American fighter jets	Israeli Air Force to expand its fighter jet fleet with purchase of 25 advanced variant of the F-15, in a $5 billion deal with Boeing. By World Israel News Staff The Israel Ministry of Defense inked a major weapons acquisition deal Wednesday with aviation giant Boeing to purchase more than two dozen of the next generation of F-15 fighter jets. The $5.2 billion agreement, part of a broader package of U.S. aid approved by the Biden administration and Congress earlier this year, includes the sale of 25 jets of the latest variant of the F-15 platform, with an option for 25 additional aircraft. The deal was finalized Wednesday following negotiations between the Israel Defense Ministry’s Mission to the U.S. and Boeing, in collaboration with the Israeli Air Force. Director General of the Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir signed the procurement authorization during his visit to the United States last month. According to a statement released Thursday by the Defense Ministry, the new F-15IA aircraft will be equipped with cutting-edge weapon systems, including the integration of state of the art Israeli technologies. The upgraded aircraft will feature enhanced range capabilities, increased payload capacity, and improved performance across various operational scenarios. 'These advantages will enable the Israeli Air Force to maintain its strategic superiority in addressing current and future challenges in the Middle East,' the ministry said. Delivery of the F-15 aircraft will begin in 2031, with 4-6 aircraft to be supplied annually. This procurement marks a significant milestone in deepening the defense cooperation between Israel and the United States, reflecting their mutual commitment to regional security. 'The Ministry is executing a comprehensive strategy to enhance the IDF's operational capabilities,' said Director General of the Israeli Defense Ministry Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir. 'We have secured procurement agreements worth nearly $40 billion (approximately NIS 150 billion) since the onset of the war. While focusing on immediate needs for advanced weaponry and ammunition at unprecedented levels, we're simultaneously investing in long-term strategic capabilities.' 'This F-15 squadron, alongside the third F-35 squadron procured earlier this year, represents a historic enhancement of our air power and strategic reach - capabilities that proved crucial during the current war. We continue to advance similar transformative agreements across all IDF domains - from air and naval forces to ground operations, intelligence, and beyond.' President of Boeing Israel, Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Ido Nehushtan, said the company 'takes pride in its longstanding partnership with Israel, a relationship that dates back to our nation's establishment. The company will continue working with the U.S. and Israeli governments to deliver the advanced F-15IA aircraft through standard military procurement channels.'

Wall Street erupts as Trump wins 2nd term	Trump’s historic comeback sparked enthusiasm in cryptocurrency markets as well, with Bitcoin touching a new all-time high above $73,000. By Jewish Breaking News Wall Street celebrated Trump’s return to the White House with a massive surge Wednesday morning. Dow futures rocketed more than 1,000 points higher before pulling back. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures followed suit, both jumping over 1% in early trading. Market optimism had begun building even before Trump’s victory became clear. All three major market averages rose over 1% on Tuesday, with every sector in the S&P 500 locking in gains. The rally adds to an already robust year, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite up over 20% annually, while the Dow has gained 12%. Trump’s historic comeback sparked enthusiasm in cryptocurrency markets as well, with Bitcoin touching a new all-time high above $73,000, surging more than 90% from its 52-week low of $35,027.44 hit exactly one year ago, according to Dow Jones Market Data. While inflation has retreated from its 9% peak, prices for everyday items, particularly food, remain significantly elevated, making economic recovery a central focus of Trump’s incoming administration. ‘We’re going to pay you back. We are going to do the best job. We’re going to turn it around. It’s got to be turned around, and it’s got to be turned around fast,’ Trump told the enthusiastic crowd at his Florida headquarters following his victory. Trump also praised key campaign supporters during his victory speech, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whom he called ‘a new star.’ Musk had recently headlined a massive Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City on October 27. The former president also acknowledged UFC CEO Dana White’s steadfast support.

New law passed: Terrorists’ families can be deported from Israel	Terrorists' parents, siblings, spouses, and children can now be stripped of Israeli citizenship and deported abroad. By World Israel News Staff The Knesset approved a new bill granting the Interior Minister the power to deport the immediate family of terrorists who hold Israeli citizenship, with 61 lawmakers voting in favor and 41 voting against the measure. The bill, which officially became law after its third reading, was approved during a Knesset session that stretched until the early hours of Thursday morning. The measure was sponsored by MKs Almog Cohen (Religious Zionism), Eliyhau Revivo (Likud), and Hanoch Milwidsky (Likud), who noted that the threat of serious consequences for terrorists' family members provides an effective deterrent to future attacks. 'From various studies conducted,&#8230;.regarding dozens of terrorists with Israeli citizenship, it was found that the terrorists' only concern was what would happen to their families after the attack,' read the bill's explanatory notes. 'There is no doubt that many terrorists will refrain from carrying out an attack if they know that their families will be punished for it.' The new law gives the Interior Minister the ability to strip terrorist' immediate family members, such as their parents, siblings, spouses, and children, of Israeli citizenship or permanent residency, if they had known in advance about the terrorists' intentions and failed to report or stop the attack. Each family member will be granted a hearing before potential deportation, with a decision regarding their status in Israel to be made within 14 days. Notably, the Shin Bet security agency expressed concerns over the law during a closed-door Knesset hearing last week. The agency asked that the proposal be enacted as a temporary measure, valid only during the ongoing war, rather than a permanent law. Additionally, the agency asked that the law only be applied to those who have an additional citizenship, so that stripping them of their status in Israel would not leave them stateless. The lawmakers did not include those caveats in the final version of the bill, which passed on Thursday morning.

Hezbollah rocket kills 18-year-old civilian in northern kibbutz	18-year-old Sivan Sadeh is the ninth person in Israel to be killed by Hezbollah bombing in a week. By World Israel News Staff An 18-year-old resident of Kibbutz Kfar Masryk was killed by rocket shrapnel on Wednesday, after the Hezbollah terror group launched a massive barrage on northern and central Israel. According to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Walla, Sivan Sadeh was discovered lifeless in his vehicle by a Thai agricultural worker several hours after the blast. Sadeh was working in agricultural fields belonging to the kibbutz, attempting to adjust an irrigation system, when the rocket fire began. It appears that Sadeh tried to take shelter in his car, but a rocket impacted just meters away. Magen David Adom first responders were called to the scene, but it was clear that Sadeh had been mortally wounded several hours earlier. 'We were led to the body by a farmhand. [The victim] didn't have a pulse and had sustained mortal, multi-systemic injuries. All we could do was declare him dead,' a paramedic told Walla. Because the field was classified as an 'open area' by the Iron Dome air defense system, the rocket was not intercepted. The IDF announced on Wednesday morning that Sgt. Ariel Sasonov, 20, of the 605th Combat Engineering Battalion, was also killed by Hezbollah bombing on Wednesday. Sasonov, from Jerusalem, was killed in Avivim, a border town. Three other soldiers were lightly wounded in the same attack. Last Thursday, an Israeli farmer and four Thai agricultural workers were killed by Hezbollah bombing in Metula, a small farming community on the border with Lebanon. The farmer, 46-year-old Omer Weinstein, was a father of four from the nearby community of Kibbutz Dafna. In a separate incident that same day, a Druze-Israeli mother and her son were killed by Hezbollah rocket fire while harvesting olives in a grove in northern Israel. 60-year-old Mina Hasson and her 30-year-old son, Karmi, were pronounced dead after an impact near the Arab city of Shfar'am.

‘Everyone is mourning’: Palestinian media reacts to Trump	A PA official also acknowledged that Palestinian state-controlled media has been very circumspect in its coverage of Trump’s election victory. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Faced with President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Palestinian leaders in Ramallah acknowledged they will have to significantly change their policies. A high-ranking Palestinian Authority official told The Press Service of Israel that frustration is running high in Ramallah. Four years of what was expected to be a friendly Biden administration, the PA was unable to obtain the reopening of the US consulate in Jerusalem, nor the reopening of Palestine Liberation Offices in Washington. He also acknowledged to TPS-IL that Palestinian state-controlled media has been very circumspect in its coverage of Trump’s election victory. 'The reason is technical and nothing more. They are careful not to publish anything that is not definitive,' the official told TPS-IL. 'But the truth is that everyone is mourning because they are now orphans and there is no one who can support them or at least hinder the Netanyahu government. We are very afraid of what Trump might do.' Coverage in the PA’s official Wafa news service and official daily paper, Al-Hayat al-Jadida focused on official messages of congratulations that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and other world leaders sent Trump. But even that was not reported till late in the day. For reasons of Arab cultural protocol, Abbas’s letter could not be released to the public ahead of Egyptian President Abd el-Fattah el-Sisi and Jordanian King Abdullah’s messages. The PA official explained that Jordan is a kingdom and Egypt is an ancient and important country, giving their leaders greater status than the Palestinian’s.

Researchers uncover bat navigation secret that could transform au...	It could potentially enhance navigation systems in autonomous drones and underwater vehicles, offering efficient ways to interpret surroundings without relying on traditional cameras or GPS. By Pesach Benson, TPS In a discovery that could inspire innovations in robotics and autonomous vehicles, Israeli scientists proved that bats can navigate over greater distances by echolocation than previously thought. 'While it’s well-known that bats use a natural sonar system to navigate by emitting sound waves and interpreting the returning echoes, previous research indicated that bats also rely on vision during flight,' researchers from Tel Aviv University and Tel Aviv’s Steinhardt Museum of Natural History said. Echolocation is a biological sonar system used by certain animals, including bats, dolphins, and some birds, to navigate and locate objects in their environment by producing sound waves. When these animals emit high-frequency sound waves, the waves travel through the air or water and bounce back after hitting objects. The returning echoes provide information about the location, size, shape, and distance of objects, allowing the animal to 'see' its surroundings using sound. This approach could potentially enhance navigation systems in autonomous drones and underwater vehicles, offering efficient ways to interpret surroundings without relying on traditional cameras or GPS. The study, led by Tel Aviv University Professor Yossi Yovel, is the first to demonstrate that bats are capable of orienting themselves across kilometers without relying on their sense of sight or other sensory aids. The team’s findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed Science journal. 'In controlled laboratory settings, we’ve seen that bats can use echolocation alone to navigate within confined spaces. However, echolocation typically detects objects only up to about 10 meters away, raising the question of whether bats can rely solely on this sense over open, natural terrains spanning many kilometers.' To answer this question, Yovel and his team designed an extensive six-year study to test bats’ long-distance navigation abilities in Israel’s Hula Valley. The team used a unique tracking system akin to GPS capable of following Kuhl’s pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus kuhlii) — a tiny species weighing only six grams that is common in the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Europe. The researchers began by capturing approximately 60 bats from a roost in the Hula Valley and transporting them about three kilometers away within their familiar environment. To isolate the effects of echolocation, they temporarily impaired the bats’ other navigational senses. Some bats were fitted with cloth strips over their eyes, effectively blinding them, while others underwent procedures to reduce their sense of smell and magnetic perception. Despite these limitations, the bats demonstrated remarkable navigational capabilities, finding their way back to their roosts without difficulty. 'This finding alone was exciting, as it showed that bats could navigate home using only echolocation under real-world conditions,' said Dr. Aya Goldshtein, a researcher at Germany’s Max Planck Institute and a former student of Yovel who was involved in the research. To understand how bats process environmental echoes to create a mental map, the researchers developed a computerized acoustic model of the bats’ natural surroundings in the Hula Valley. This model allowed the scientists to simulate the echoes bats would experience in the environment, helping to shed light on the bats’ navigational decision-making. According to Yovel, this model is based on a 3D map of the Hula Valley, which replicates the echoes that bats encounter during their flights. 'We found that bats actively choose routes rich in acoustic information, such as areas with dense vegetation, where echoes offer more detail than in open fields,' he explained. 'They avoid open spaces where the echoes provide less navigational data. Some regions produce distinct echoes, which become auditory landmarks for the bats, helping them maintain a mental map of the area.' This map, composed of 'sound landmarks,' enables bats to recognize their environment much like humans use visual landmarks to navigate familiar surroundings. The study provides the first empirical evidence that bats construct such detailed acoustic maps in natural settings, which enhances our understanding of their complex sensory and cognitive abilities. The findings challenge long-standing assumptions about the limits of echolocation. 'Bats have shown us that they are far more adaptable than we imagined,' said Yovel. 'Their ability to rely on a sophisticated system of sound-based navigation over vast distances not only reflects the remarkable evolution of their sensory abilities but may inspire new technologies in areas like robotics and autonomous navigation.'

Hezbollah launches rockets at Trump Heights in the Golan	It is the second Israeli community named after a sitting U.S. president, second to Moshav Kfar Truman. By JNS A Hezbollah rocket attack triggered sirens in Trump Heights in the Golan Heights on Wednesday, shortly after the town’s namesake delivered his victory speech in Florida following the U.S. presidential election. A short time later, the Lebanese terrorist group launched a 10-rocket barrage at central Israel, temporarily halting flights at Ben-Gurion International Airport. No injuries were reported in either attack. The community on the strategic plateau was renamed Ramat Trump in 2019 after then-President Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. It was the second Israeli community to be named after a sitting U.S. president after Moshav Kfar Truman, which is located east of Ben-Gurion International Airport. On July 24, a Hezbollah rocket hit a soccer field in Majdal Shams, one of four Druze communities in the Israeli Golan Heights, killing 12 children. Hezbollah has fired more than 16,000 projectiles at Israel since Oct. 8, 2023, the day after the Hamas-led invasion of the northwestern Negev.

Two injured in terrorist ramming attack north of Jerusalem	Two Israelis injured in a terrorist ramming and stabbing attack outside the biblical city of Shiloh, north of Jerusalem. By World Israel News Staff Two people were injured in a Palestinian terrorist ramming attack in Samaria, north of Jerusalem, on Wednesday afternoon. The ramming attack occurred at Shiloh Junction, near the site of the biblical city and the modern Israeli town of the same name, on Route 60, when a terrorist driving down the road rammed into several pedestrians waiting near a bus stop. After his vehicle came to a halt, witnesses say that the terrorist exited his car while brandishing a screwdriver, and attempted to stab his victims. Before he could reach his intended victims, however, the terrorist was shot and killed at the scene by a legally armed civilian. The victims have been identified as a 26-year-old woman and a 15-year-old boy, both of whom are currently listed in light condition. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the victims and evacuate them to Hadassah Mount Scopus Medical Center in Jerusalem. 'We quickly arrived at the scene and saw a commotion, two citizens aged 26 and 15 were walking while fully conscious and suffering from minor bruises on their bodies after being hit by a vehicle,' said senior MDA medic Elad Kadmon and MDA medic Ariel Shtvi. 'We gave them initial medical treatment in the field and then evacuated them in MDA ambulances to the hospital when their condition was mild. On the spot, MDA teams examined a number of anxiety victims who did not need further treatment at the hospital.' The terrorist has been identified as 32-year-old Kharat Jabara, a resident of the Palestinian Authority-administered town of Dayr al-Ghusun, near Tulkarem in western Samaria.

Flights interrupted after missile strikes Israel’s largest airpor...	The projectile was one of ten fired from Lebanon at the center of the country, sending two million people to bomb shelters. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Flights to and from Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport were halted briefly Wednesday after a missile hit one of the airport’s parking lots during a barrage launched by Hezbollah from Lebanon. While many were panicked by the large boom, no physical injuries were caused by the explosion. Some damage to the property was reported, with no details as yet regarding its severity. According to the Ice news site, the missile did not descend directly in the flight paths of either departing or arriving planes and did not penetrate the actual airspace of the airport. After about an hour where incoming planes circled the airport and all outgoing activity was halted, all flight activity returned to normal. The army announced that ten missiles had been fired at Israel’s central region. Nine were shot down as some two million people raced for safe rooms in cities such as Tel Aviv, Raanana, Herzliya and Ramat Gan. In Kfar Chabad, missile or interceptor fragments penetrated the ceiling of a childcare facility. The staff and young children were not hurt as they had evacuated in time to their protected area. One large section of a rocket fell directly onto an empty, parked car in Raanana, several feet of its vertical shaft seen dramatically standing upright through the smashed windshield. Rocket warning sirens also sounded in northern Israel, in the upper and western Galilee and Golan Heights as well as in communities close to the Lebanese border such as Metula and Kiryat Shmona. The government has claimed that the army’s hundreds of bombings of Hezbollah weapons sites, and weeks-long ground incursion into Lebanese border villages and tunnel networks have destroyed most of the Iranian terror proxy’s missile supply. Still, over the weeks of fighting, Hezbollah forces have often managed to launch about 80-100 missiles, rockets and UAVs a day, mostly at northern Israel. The IDF announced later Wednesday that in current fighting in southern Lebanon, the reservist 8th Armored Brigade, under the command of the 91st Division, killed dozens of terrorists, including the area’s battalion commander, by directing an Air Force jet to a suspected compound. In addition, the forces located, confiscated and destroyed many weapons, including Russian-made Kornet anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), grenades, weapons and explosives that were hidden in civilian houses in villages and in secreted in underground infrastructures.

Biden administration questions firing of Israeli defense minister...	American officials say the Biden administration is 'concerned' by Prime Minister Netanyahu's decision to replace his defense minister, speculating that the premier used the election as an opportunity to remove a figure considered more moderate by the White House. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration was taken aback by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision Tuesday to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud), leaving top White House officials 'concerned.' Publicly, the U.S. has vowed to work 'closely' with Gallant's replacement. 'America’s commitment to Israel’s security remains ironclad and the US Department of Defense will continue to work closely with Israel’s next Minister of Defense,' said Defense Department spokesman Major General Patrick Ryder. Privately, however, administration officials were vexed by the sudden announcement. Multiple American officials spoke with The Times of Israel, telling the media outlet that the U.S. had no foreknowledge of Netanyahu's plans to replace his defense chief, and that the decision, made in the midst of a major conflict on two fronts and amid concerns of a major Iranian attack, was unnerving for the White House. Some officials speculated that Netanyahu took advantage of the American election to fire Gallant, who has been perceived by the Biden administration as a moderate voice within the Israeli government and a useful ally. 'We have real questions about the reasons for Gallant’s firing and about what is driving the decision,' one American official was quoted as saying. 'The surprising decision to fire Defense Minister Gallant is concerning, especially in the middle of two wars and as Israel prepares to defend against a potential attack from Iran.' On Tuesday, Netanyahu announced that he had removed Gallant from his position, saying that during the wars against Hamas and Hezbollah, his trust in his defense chief had 'begun to crack.' 'Gallant and I had substantial disagreements on the management of the military campaign, disagreements which were accompanied by public statements and actions that contravened the decisions of the Government and the Security Cabinet,' Netanyahu said. 'I have made multiple attempts to resolve these disagreements, but they became increasingly wider. They were also brought to the knowledge of the public in an inappropriate manner, and what is even worse, they have reached the knowledge of the enemy; our enemies have taken great delight in these disagreements and have derived much benefit from them.' Netanyahu tapped long-time ally Israel Katz (Likud), who currently serves as Foreign Minister, to replace Gallant, while Minister Without Portfolio Gideon Sa'ar, a former member of the Likud and rival of Netanyahu, is slated to take over as Foreign Minister.

Josh Stein defeats former self-described ‘black Nazi’ to become f...	The Democratic attorney general handily beat the lieutenant governor who once called himself a 'black Nazi.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News North Carolina Attorney-General Josh Stein became the state’s first Jewish governor Tuesday by beating Republican Mark Robinson, who once described himself as a 'black Nazi.' The race was called after Stein won 54.8% of the vote to Robinson’s 40.2%. His victory was largely expected by October, mostly due to the notoriety Lieut. Gov. Robinson gained for both sexist and antisemitic comments he had made which came to light during the campaign. CNN revealed in September that between 2008-2012, Robinson had posted on a pornography website that he was a 'black NAZI,' backed the idea of bringing back slavery, and wrote sexually graphic stories, including one about being a 'Peeping Tom' in a local gym’s women’s showers. After this story broke, Donald Trump distanced himself from Robinson even though he had been an early favorite of the former – and next – U.S. president. Robinson, who only broke into politics in 2020, had also posted antisemitic statements such as calling the Black Panther superhero movie a creation of 'an agnostic Jew' made solely 'to pull the shekels out of your Schvartze pockets,' using the derogatory Yiddish term for black people. In 2017 he called the Holocaust 'hogwash' and seemingly disputed the fact that six million Jews had been murdered during World War II. While calling some of his past comments 'poorly worded,' however, Robinson denied being an antisemite and has been a vocal supporter of Israel in its ongoing war against Hamas. Stein, meanwhile, broke the religion barrier to the highest office in the state as a Reform Jew known for being active in his synagogue. He has publicly embraced his Judaism, posting to X before Rosh Hashanah in 2022 that 'Our Jewish faith obliges us to do our part to make the world a better place, better than we found it. This principle guides me as your attorney general.' Regarding Israel, Stein follows the line set by President Joe Biden. Just a few days after the Hamas invasion and massacre of 1,200 people on October 7, 2023, he attended a Jewish event and also wrote in solidarity, 'We stand with Israel.' But following months of pro-Palestinian protests and encampments on college campuses that included some in his own state, he took a more nuanced stance after a large anti-Israel protest took place at the University of North Carolina in May. 'The right to free speech is fundamental, and students should be able to exercise it peacefully. But any antisemitism, violence or other acts of hate are unacceptable. The safety of all students is critical,' he told a news reporter. Like Biden as well, he is a believer in the so-called 'two state solution' to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and has echoed the administration’s more recent commentary on the ongoing war. 'Hamas represents a real threat to Israel,' he told The News & Observer several months ago. 'Israel is justified to try to address that threat. They have to do it in a way that minimizes … the impact on civilians because there are a couple of million Palestinians who live in Gaza who have nothing to do with Hamas, and are just trying to live their lives.' Stein is succeeding another Democrat, Roy Cooper, who couldn’t run again due to term limits, even though North Carolina is a solidly red state on a national level, having voted for a Democratic president only once in the last 44 years.

Harris won 79% of the Jewish vote, exit polling shows	President-elect Donald Trump appears to have underperformed among Jewish voters according to initial exit polls, but made massive gains among other minority groups. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Vice President Kamala Harris won the overwhelming majority of votes cast by American Jews in battleground states in Tuesday's election, and potentially outperforming every Democratic candidate in the past two decades, initial exit polls indicate. Harris is projected to lose the election not only in the electoral college, but potentially also in the popular vote, where she currently trails by over five million votes. According to preliminary exit poll data collected by the Edison Research firm on behalf of multiple media outlets, including the Washington Post and NBC News, 79% of American Jews voted for the vice president, compared to just 21% who voted for former President Donald Trump. If correct, the initial estimate would place Harris ahead of every Democratic presidential candidate since then-Vice President Al Gore ran against George W. Bush in 2000, winning 79% of the Jewish vote to Bush's 19%. According to the Jewish Virtual Library, no candidate has received more than 79% since Bill Clinton in 1992. At the same time, Harris underperformed, among other minority groups, including blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, and American Indians. While the vast majority of African Americans voted for Harris, the Democratic share of the black vote fell from 87% in 2020 exit polls to 86%. The drop was far more pronounced among Hispanic/Latino voters, with Trump receiving 45% of the Hispanic/Latino vote, compared to 32% in 2020, while Harris received 53%, down from 65% for Joe Biden four years earlier. American Indians backed Trump by a nearly two-to-one margin, 64% to 35%, while those in the 'Other' category were more evenly divided, 50% backing Trump compared to 45% who backed Harris, according to the exit polls. White Evangelical Christians backed Trump over Harris by a margin of 81% to 17%. One caveat in the data is that the preliminary exiting polling is based on the results in ten key battleground states. While the difference between national results and the combined results from those ten battleground states may be minor for some demographic groups, it leaves out the bulk of the Orthodox Jewish population, centered around New York and New Jersey, potentially skewing the results in favor of Harris and against Trump. Other exit polling data, collected by AP VoteCast for The Associated Press, showed Harris winning just 67% of the Jewish vote, more in keeping with recent elections, compared to Trump with 31%. Among Muslim voters, 61% voted for Harris, down from 63% who backed Joe Biden in 2020, with Trump winning 30%, down from 35% in 2020.

‘History’s greatest comeback’ – Netanyahu congratulates Trump	Prime Minister Netanyahu one of the first world leaders to congratulate Donald Trump on his 2024 presidential election victory. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin and his wife Sara are among the first world leaders to congratulate president-elect Donald Trump on winning the 2024 U.S. presidential election. 'Dear Donald and Melania Trump, Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback!' read a statement from the premier's office. 'Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory! In true friendship, yours, Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu.' Netanyahu's Miami-based son, Yair, also offered his congratulations to Trump. 'Hallelujah! The most pro-Israel president in America's history is back! Great day for America! Great day for Israel! Great day for the free world!' the younger Netanyahu wrote on his Instagram account. 'Congratulations to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump,' wrote Culture Minister Miki Zohar, of Netanyahu's Likud party, on social media platform X. 'We are already looking forward to the next four years.' 'God bless America. God bless Israel,' wrote Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionism) on his X account. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Religious Zionism) reposted a tweet he wrote earlier this year, which read 'God bless Trump.' He then added one word: 'Yesssss.' Notably, Trump is reportedly putting pressure on Israel to wrap up its war in Gaza before he takes office in January 2025. It's unclear if Trump would demand that Israel withdraw all of its troops from the Strip, or if a declaration officially ending the war would suffice. In his victory speech at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the president-elect appeared to reference the ongoing fighting in the Middle East. 'I’m not going to start wars, I’m going to stop wars,' Trump said in his victory speech. When he was president, Trump added, 'we had no wars, for four years we had no wars. Except we defeated ISIS.'

‘Wake up, Iran wants to destroy us’ – Arab Israeli activist	Israel can't be complacent when Iran is threatening a nuclear strike on Tel Aviv, says prominent Zionist Arab activist Yosef Haddad. By World Israel News Staff A large banner hung in Tehran depicting a nuclear attack on Tel Aviv sparked an impassioned response from a prominent pro-Israel Arab activist, who urged Israel to wake up to the existential threat posed by the Islamic state. 'The Iranian regime hung this sign in the heart of Tehran. In Farsi, it reads 'Teloshima' - a play on words of Tel Aviv and Hiroshima. Along with the image [of a nuclear explosion], everyone can understand the threat - a nuclear missile striking Tel Aviv,' wrote Yosef Haddad on his Instagram account. Haddad, an Arab-Christian citizen of Israel who publicly advocates on behalf of the Jewish State, stressed that Iran's nuclear development program poses a real threat to Israel's existence. 'In this case you don't need good intelligence, you don't need Unit 8200 or the Mossad,' he continued. 'The writing on the wall, or in this case on a billboard in the heart of Iran, is clear. They are threatening in a direct, personal way&#8230;[making it clear that] their goal is to destroy us, and we must not be apathetic or complacent for a moment,' Haddad added. 'You cannot rely on the world or anyone else to do the work for our security, only us, only the IDF. This sign, together with their recent threats to attack us again, give us a good reason to strike their nuclear sites&#8230;It's time to chop off the snake's head.' Iran launched two unprecedented ballistic missile attacks against Israel in a six month span, causing damage to military sites throughout the country. Under intense pressure from the Biden administration, Israel launched a retaliatory strike against Iran, but avoided attacking the Islamic Republic's nuclear sites or oil assets. Iran is threatening to once again strike Israel with previously unused weaponry, triggering warnings from Israel that should Iran attack a third time, Israel will 'not hold back' with its response.

Trump defeats Harris, Republicans retake US Senate	President-elect Donald Trump wins key battleground states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, securing the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President Donald Trump has won Tuesday's presidential election, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris, according to projections by Fox News and RealClearPolitics early Wednesday morning. Trump is now projected to win Pennsylvania, with both Fox News and RCP calling the crucial battleground state with its 19 electoral votes, putting him over the top to 270, assuming he wins Alaska, which is widely expected to go Republican by a wide margin. Fox News has also called Wisconsin, with ten electoral votes, for Trump putting him at 277 electoral votes called already, and 280 electoral votes with Alaska's expected support for the Republican candidate. As of 2:00 a.m. Eastern Time, Trump currently leads Harris in the popular vote count with 67.7 million votes, compared to 62.6 million for the Vice President. The former president also won the key battleground states of Georgia and North Carolina with leads of over two points in each state, 50.7% to 48.5%, and 51.0% to 47.8% respectively. With 94.8% of the vote counted in Pennsylvania, Trump currently leads Harris by nearly three points, 50.98% to 48.06%, with an even larger lead in Wisconsin with 89% of the vote counted, with Trump up with 51.3% to 47.2% for Harris. In his home state of New York, Trump made major inroads and is now on track to win the largest share of the vote for a Republican presidential nominee since George H.W. Bush in 1988. With 96% of the vote counted, Trump has received 44.57% of the vote, up from 37.6% in 2020 and 36.5% in 2016. The prediction market platform Polymarket currently shows Trump with a 98.9% chance of winning the election, with the former president likely to win Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona. Trump leads Harris in all three states by margins ranging from 1.5 points to 6.3 points. Should the former president win all three states and lose Nebraska's Second Congressional district, as he is expected to, he will win 312 of the 538 electoral votes, win Harris receiving 226. In addition to Trump's presidential win, Republicans are projected to retake control of the U.S. Senate, flipping control over of seats in West Virginia and Ohio, giving the GOP at least 51 seats, with Democrats projected to win at least 15 seats for a total of 43, with 6 races yet to be called.

Bernie Marcus, Home Depot founder who gave to Republicans and Isr...	Marcus helped propel Trump into the White House in 2016 by contributing $7 million and gave even more four years later to finance his failed reelection campaign. By Asaf Elia-Shalev, JTA Bernie Marcus, the billionaire who co-founded Home Depot and became a Republican megadonor and supporter of civic and political causes in the United States and Israel, has died. Marcus, 95, died late Monday in Boca Raton, Florida. His death came on the eve of an election into which he had poured millions of dollars to support Donald Trump and Republicans across the country. In the final political donation recorded publicly before his death, made in July, Marcus gave $1 million to the United Democracy Project, a campaign fundraising group affiliated with the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC that Marcus has supported since its creation in 2022. 'The Home Depot is deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved founder, Bernard Marcus,' the company he founded in 1978 said in a statement announcing Marcus’ death. 'To us, he was simply ‘Bernie.’' Over the course of his life, Marcus donated more than $2 billion to various causes, according to Forbes, and he leaves behind an estimated net worth of $11 billion that will mostly go to the Marcus Foundation. Born to Jewish immigrants in Newark, New Jersey, in 1929, Marcus 'never lost sight of his humble roots, using his success not for fame or fortune but to generously help others,' the company said. Among Marcus’ legacies are the transformation of downtown Atlanta with the establishment of the Georgia Aquarium; a massive advance in autism awareness and research thanks to the Marcus Autism Center, also in Atlanta; and the founding of the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem, an important think tank focused on governance. 'The State of Israel lost one of its greatest friends, and I have lost my wisest mentor,' IDI President Yohanan Plesner said in a statement. Toward the end of his life, Marcus, with his wife Billi, became perhaps best known for his staunch support of Donald Trump, second only to Sheldon Adelson among conservative Jewish megadonors. Marcus helped propel Trump into the White House in 2016 by contributing $7 million and gave even more four years later to finance his failed reelection campaign. Last year, he said he intended to support Trump again in this year’s election despite the former president’s felony convictions and his 'brash style.' 'We must change the current trajectory of the nation and solve the problems created in the last three years,' Marcus wrote in November 2023 in an oped endorsing Trump. 'We must also reject calls from some politicians to replace our free market system with big government socialism.' Marcus also defended former Trump advisor Steve Bannon against charges of abetting antisemitism and extremism. At one point, Home Depot fended off calls to boycott the company over Marcus’ politics. Unlike Adelson, his peer in philanthropy and Republican politics, Marcus donated money in Israel while making sure to avoid taking sides in the country’s fractured parliamentary politics. In addition to the nonpartisan Israel Democracy Institute, he gave to causes like health care, including the Marcus National Blood Services Center, established with a $25 million donation. His philanthropy in Israel was rooted in his sense of identity. 'I’m proud of the fact that I’m Jewish and what happened with the Holocaust is not going to happen again if I can do anything about it,' he said in an extensive profile published by Philanthropy Magazine in 2012. Where some focused on threats from without, Marcus worried primarily about how the country’s own government structures were undermining its viability. 'Until Israel has a constitution and a Bill of Rights, the rule of law is murky. And I’m a great believer in the rule of law,' he said in 2012. Israel still has no constitution. Born months before the start of the Great Depression, Marcus was raised in a tenement in Newark, New Jersey by immigrant parents from Russia. A teenager during World War II and its aftermath, he joined his family on trips to the Catskills where he performed magic and hypnotism. The experience of reading and satisfying an audience helped seed a dream of becoming a psychiatrist. But Marcus’ parents couldn’t afford to send him to medical school so he became a pharmacist instead. (He also said he was rejected because of quotas limiting Jewish enrollment.) He didn’t much care for the technical side of the field, but he took a liking to sales. That realization led him to become a retail manager, taking ever larger roles until he came to a chain of hardware stores in Los Angeles. At age 49, after leaving the company amid corporate turmoil, Marcus joined Arthur Blank to found a new home improvement retailer with a vision that would transform the industry. The pair picked Atlanta as their starting point, found investors and quickly opened a number of stores under the Home Depot banner. They tapped into a massive unmet demand among Americans to fix up their own homes. Unlike the old-style of hardware stores, Home Depot offered a massive warehouse space that stocked not only tools but paint and lumber, which had typically required a visit to separate retailers. In Marcus’ 19 years as CEO, Home Depot became a ubiquitous American brand. He remained chair of the company’s board of directors until 2002 when he left to focus on giving away the wealth he had accumulated. In 2010, Marcus signed the Giving Pledge, the initiative by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet to encourage the ultra-wealthy to give away a majority of their money to charity. Then, in 2020, he joined the Jewish Future Pledge, a promise by its signers to earmark most of their wealth to Jewish or Israel-related causes. He had been raised to give away his money, Marcus said in an interview, pointing to the memory of his mother who sometimes denied him a nickel for ice cream, saying the coin was going toward planting trees in Israel instead. Marcus took pride in his company’s record of ingraining the value of tzedakah, or charity, in his employees. 'Kids come out of working at Home Depot and they all have this feeling of tzedakah. I turned them all into Jews!' he was once quoted as saying. The largest and most notable acts of charity were not necessarily dedicated to Jewish causes. In Georgia, he was a major patron of civic institutions. In the late 1990s, Marcus and the then-governor of Georgia, Roy Barnes, flew back to Atlanta from a tour of Israel. During the flight, Marcus said he wanted to give a gift to the city of Atlanta, proposing an aquarium that could anchor a redevelopment of downtown. That conversation culminated in one of the largest facilities of its kind in the world, the Georgia Aquarium, which opened in 2005 thanks in large part to a $250 million donation from Marcus. An employee’s struggles parenting a child with autism spurred Marcus’ interest in the issue, which he championed by founding a world-leading institute, the Marcus Autism Center, and spearheading a research and advocacy group, Autism Speaks. Also in the realm of heath, he was a major donor to Atlanta’s Shepherd Center for spinal and brain injury rehabilitation, and the founding donor of a neuroscience institute at the Boca Raton Regional Hospital in Florida. Marcus was also influential in the field of philanthropy itself, modeling a business-like mindset that always sought as large a return on a philanthropic investment as possible. His libertarian ideology and faith in the free market also drove his contributions to advocacy against government regulations. In his final years, Marcus grew increasingly concerned about antisemitism in the United States and on college campuses, which he said he thought had risen to the levels he experienced as a child and young adult prior to the founding of Israel. In a January 2023 video interview with the Jewish News Syndicate, he said Jews who donated to universities, which he said taught students to hate Judaism and Israel, were 'not the brightest people in the world.' In contrast, he said, he was careful to give in ways that advanced his values. 'We are very careful with our giving. And we’ve given away over $2 billion in the last several years, and in the places that we’ve given it, we follow it very carefully,' he said. 'We check it. We make sure that the money is being spent the way it should be spent.' Marcus is survived by his wife and stepson; his children from his first marriage; and grandchildren, for whom he said his 2022 book, 'Kick Up Some Dust: Lessons on Thinking Big, Giving Back, and Doing It Yourself,' was intended. 'I haven’t been the greatest grandfather in the world because I’ve been busy doing so many things,' he said in the JNS interview. 'I wanted them to know all the things I’m doing.'

Bomb threats targeting polling places came from Russian email dom...	Georgia, a crucial swing state, received more than 24 threats, most of which occurred in Atlanta’s Fulton County, Georgia’s most populated district. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon More than two dozen non-credible bomb threats targeting polling places across the country came from 'Russian email domains,' the FBI said Tuesday. 'The FBI is aware of bomb threats to polling locations in several states, many of which appear to originate from Russian email domains. None of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far,' the agency said in a statement. The FBI did not say which states received the threats. One official told Reuters that Georgia, a crucial swing state, received more than 24 threats, most of which occurred in Atlanta’s Fulton County, Georgia’s most populated district. At least two Fulton County polling locations targeted by the threats were briefly evacuated on Tuesday. Those two locations reopened after half an hour, officials said. The county is urging a judge to extend the voting sites’ hours past the 7 p.m. deadline. Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger condemned Russia’s interference in his state’s elections. 'They're up to mischief, it seems. They don't want us to have a smooth, fair, and accurate election, and if they can get us to fight among ourselves, they can count that as a victory,' he said. Raffensperger also applauded Georgia’s response to the initial threats saying, 'We pretty well dispelled that very quickly.'

New poll shows majority of Dems blame Israel for Mideast conflict	American voters show strong support (55%) for economic sanctions against Iran, particularly targeting its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. By Jewish Breaking News A new poll has exposed a dramatic partisan divide over the Middle East conflict, with an overwhelming 60% of Democratic voters holding Israel responsible for the escalation – a view shared by only one-quarter of Republicans. The survey conducted by AP-NORC, shows broad agreement across party lines that Hamas, Iran’s government, and Hezbollah bear significant responsibility, with approximately 60% of all voters attributing 'a lot' of blame to these actors. However, the Democratic base’s hostile attitude towards Israel could impact Vice President Harris’s grab at Michigan and Pennsylvania which have a significant Jewish and Muslim presence. In Michigan, Vice President Kamala Harris holds onto a precarious 4-point lead over Donald Trump (49%-45%) and in Pennsylvania she holds a one-point advantage with 48%-47%. On policy responses, American voters show strong support (55%) for economic sanctions against Iran, particularly targeting its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Yet they remain deeply divided on military aid, with more voters opposing than supporting direct funding for Israeli military operations. The prospect of American military involvement generates significant concern, with about 40% of voters expressing serious worries about potential U.S. engagement. Support for troop deployment remains minimal – only about two in ten voters favor sending U.S. forces to assist Israel, with a similar number remaining neutral on the issue. Regarding diplomatic efforts, approximately half of voters believe the U.S. is doing 'about as much as it can' to broker agreements between Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah. However, opinion splinters with roughly 30% pushing for increased involvement and 20% advocating for less engagement.'

Jewish Democrats elected governor in Delaware, North Carolina, Cr...	A former public-school math teacher and small-business owner, Meyer is a staunch supporter of Israel, which he has visited three times. By Menachem Wecker and Izzy Salant, JNS With the election of Matt Meyer and Josh Stein as governor of Delaware and North Carolina, respectively, on Tuesday, the two join four other Jewish governors: Jared Polis (Colo.), J. B. Pritzker (Ill.), Josh Green (Hawaii) and Josh Shapiro (Pa.), all Democrats. 'It’s great to be at a point where a Jewish governor, even in states with small Jewish populations, is not unusual,' according to Mark Mellman, CEO of an eponymous polling and consulting firm and president of Democratic Majority for Israel. 'The Democratic Party is committed to equal opportunity and pluralism a fact reinforced by the fact that all six of these Jewish governors are Democrats,' Mellman told JNS. The Associated Press called the Delaware gubernatorial race for Meyer, who defeated Mike Ramone, a member of the Delaware state House. With 90% of votes counted, Meyer was up 11.8 percentage points, with 274,823 votes, per the AP. A former public-school math teacher and small-business owner, Meyer is a staunch supporter of Israel, which he has visited three times. He told Jewish Insider 'Israel is going through a really challenging time right now, and we have to do what we can to support what is one of America’s strongest allies in the world.' Stein, North Carolina’s attorney general, was up nearly 15 percentage points on Republican Mark Robinson, with 2.6 million votes and 83% of votes counted, per the AP, which called the race. Robinson, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina, came under fire for social-media posts, including calling himself 'a black Nazi' and quoting Hitler. Robinson denied having posted the comments. U.S. President Joe Biden called Meyer and Stein, among others, to congratulate them on their election, per the White House pool report. Craig Goldman, a Republican member of the Texas state House, defeated Trey Hunt to become the representative of Texas’s 12th Congressional District. Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas) currently holds the seat but opted not to seek reelection. Goldman is the third Jewish GOP member of the U.S. House of Representatives after incumbents Reps. Max Miller (R-Ohio) and David Kustoff (R-Tenn.). Kustoff defeated Sarah Freeman in the state’s 8th Congressional District, according to the Associated Press. With 79% of votes counted, Kustoff was up 47.5 percentage points, with 235,357 votes, per the AP. With 88% of votes counted in Ohio’s 7th Congressional District, Miller was up more than 15 percentage points with 179,269 votes, per the AP, which called the race. Goldman was up nearly 30 percentage points, with 192,808 votes and 78% of votes counted, according to the Associated Press, which called the race. 'Welcome to Congress one of my best friends,' wrote Matt Brooks, CEO of the Republican Jewish Coalition. 'So proud of you, brother.' AIPAC, which endorsed Goldman, wrote shortly before 11 p.m. that 'so far, 190 AIPAC-backed candidates have won their elections tonight.' Goldman drew praise from House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.)—who chairs the House Republican Conference—and Aryeh Lightstone, a former senior adviser to David Friedman, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel. On his campaign website, Goldman stated that he would stand with Israel, 'the only true democracy in the Middle East.' 'The enemies of Israel are dangerous and relentless. The October 2023 slaughter of over 1,400 Israelis, including at least 36 Americans, at the hands of Hamas makes this reality abundantly clear,' he wrote. 'While Israeli hostages remain captive in Gaza, it is critical that Israel is able to defend herself and ultimately is able to achieve its military objective: to dismantle Hamas.' 'There is simply no room for ambivalence or wavering on where the United States stands in this matter,' he added on the site. 'The United States must continue to stand by Israel in its fight against the sheer brutality and inhumanity of Hamas.'

Hostage families organization says Gallant firing provides ‘new o...	We trust Minister Katz to increase and further intensify the military pressure on what is left of Hamas in Gaza. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Tikva Forum, a hostage family organization that rejects negotiations with terrorists, finds new hope for the release of family members following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's firing of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The dismissal of Minister Galant and the appointment of Israel Katz opens up an opportunity for us to make a strategic change regarding the return of the hostages,' the Tikva Forum stated. The Tikva Forum said it would support proposals to offer money in exchange for the hostages and to continue to defeat Hamas to put pressure on the terror group to release captives. 'We trust Minister Katz to increase and further intensify the military pressure on what is left of Hamas in Gaza. All means are kosher for the return of our children,' the organization said. The Hostages Families Forum also called Gallant's dismissal a 'continuation' of efforts within the government to 'torpedo a hostage deal.' Netanyahu announced the firing of Gallant in a video statement, saying, 'Unfortunately, the trust between me and the minister of defense has been broken over the past months. There were significant gaps regarding the management of the [military] campaign, and these gaps were accompanied by statements and actions that contradicted the government's decisions.' 'I made repeated efforts to bridge these gaps, but they only widened. These issues even reached the public in an unacceptable manner, and, worse, became known to our enemies, who took pleasure and found advantage in it,' added Netanyahu. Israel is offering Gaza terrorists who are holding hostages captive large cash rewards and the promise of free passage out of the Gaza Strip for themselves and their families if they hand over the hostages to Israel, Israel's Channel 12 reported Monday night. According to the report, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed security officials to offer a massive reward, totaling 'several million dollars,' some outlets reporting $5 million, for each captive who is freed, along with guarantees of safe passage out of the Gaza Strip for any captors who agree to the deal.

Netanyahu may also fire heads of IDF and Shin Bet	The incoming Defense Minister, Israel Katz, is expected to carry out Netanyahu's plans. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News After Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Walla reports that he may also fire IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and the head of Shin Bet (Israel's security agency) Ronen Bar. Although Netanyahu has the sole authority to replace the head of Shin Bet, only the Defense Minister can dismiss or appoint a new IDF Chief of Staff. The incoming Defense Minister, Israel Katz, is expected to carry out Netanyahu's plans. With Katz assuming a new role as the Defense Minister, Minister-without-Portfolio Gideon Sa'ar will replace Katz as Foreign Minister. Unfortunately, the trust between me and the minister of defense has been broken over the past months. There were significant gaps regarding the management of the [military] campaign, and these gaps were accompanied by statements and actions that contradicted the decisions of the government,' the premier said in a video statement. 'I made repeated efforts to bridge these gaps, but they only widened. These issues even reached the public in an unacceptable manner, and, worse, became known to our enemies, who took pleasure and found advantage in it,' added Netanyahu. Responding to his firing on X, the defense minister wrote, 'The security of the State of Israel was and will always remain my life's mission.' Yoav Gallant and Netanyahu have been at odds since the 2023 judicial reform crisis when the Defense Minister held a press conference and urged the Prime Minister to halt the legislation amid massive protests. One day later, Netanyahu declared his intention to fire Gallant over his remarks, but this decision was reversed. Members of the security cabinet also criticized Gallant over his insistence on Palestinian rule over Gaza following the war. He also demanded that Netanyahu compromise over having security control over the Philadelphi Corridor.

Israel’s future a key focus as Harris and Trump square off in his...	With a track record of unprecedented support, Donald Trump positions himself as Israel’s defender. By Jewish Breaking News Voters head to the polls today to choose between Vice President Kamala Harris, who emerged as the Democratic nominee just three and a half months ago, and former President Donald Trump, who has spent nearly two years campaigning to reclaim the White House. The path to this historic matchup has been marked by dramatic turns. Trump launched his campaign days after the 2022 midterms, systematically defeating a field of over a dozen Republican challengers. His campaign gained momentum despite four criminal indictments, making him the first former president to face felony charges. A near-fatal assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania just before the Republican National Convention in July further galvanized his base. The race transformed dramatically when President Biden, following a disastrous late June debate performance against Trump, ended his re-election bid and endorsed Harris. The vice president’s ascension to the nomination sparked an immediate surge in Democratic fundraising and polling numbers. For Jewish voters, both candidates have emphasized unwavering support for Israel while offering starkly different visions for achieving peace and security in the Middle East. With a track record of unprecedented support, Donald Trump positions himself as Israel’s defender. 'If we continue down our current path, with four more years of Kamala, Israel will be faced not just with an attack, but with total annihilation,' Trump told the Israeli-American Council in September. 'You don’t have a protector. You have a big protector in me.' Trump also has rejected ceasefire calls in Gaza entirely, framing them as dangerous concessions. At an August press conference, he criticized Harris’s position: 'From the start, Harris has worked to tie Israel’s hands behind its back, demanding an immediate ceasefire.' Instead, Trump advocates for swift military victory, telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'Get your victory and get it over with.' Harris, on the other hand, has taken a more aggressive stance toward Israel. 'I am working to ensure it ends, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom and self-determination,' she said in a call with Jewish leaders during the High Holiday season. With approximately 75 million early votes already cast, both campaigns have concentrated their final efforts on seven crucial battleground states – Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada. \Over $2.3 billion has been spent on advertising in these decisive states, reports Fox News. On Election Eve, both nominees targeted Pennsylvania, the largest prize among swing states with 19 electoral votes. Harris concluded her campaign with a symbolic rally at Philadelphia’s 'Rocky Steps,' while Trump held a massive gathering in Pittsburgh. The former president then made his final appearance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, mirroring his closing rallies from 2016 and 2020. Harris cast her vote early by mail from California, while Trump plans to vote in person in Palm Beach, Florida. The vice president will await results at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington D.C., while Trump has chosen a convention center in West Palm Beach for his election night headquarters.

US soldier injured during Biden’s failed Gaza pier operation has ...	The Pentagon dismantled the $230 million Gaza pier in July after just three weeks of operation. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon A U.S. Army soldier died last week after suffering non-combat injuries earlier this year while supporting President Joe Biden’s humanitarian pier off the coast of Gaza, the military announced Monday. Sergeant Quandarius Davon Stanley, 23, sustained critical injuries in May while working on the U.S.-built pier, which Biden said would support the flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. Stanley recently retired from the military due to the injuries and was undergoing treatment at a long-term care facility before his death on Oct. 31. 'Stanley was an instrumental and well respected first line leader in the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary (TBX), especially during the mission to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza,' Colonel John Gray said. Two other service members sustained minor injuries during the pier’s operation and have since returned to duty, the Times of Israel reported. The Pentagon dismantled the $230 million Gaza pier in July after just three weeks of operation. The corridor helped the U.S. military deliver 137 trucks of aid into the war-torn region, but several of the trucks were intercepted before they could reach the civilian population. Aid groups criticized the project as ineffective and wasteful. Its 20-day operation was plagued by rough weather and security problems that drastically limited the amount of aid entering Gaza. Biden, who first announced the pier’s construction during his State of the Union speech in March, expressed his disappointment over the project’s failure at a news conference in July. 'I’ve been disappointed that some of the things that I put forward have not succeeded as well—like the port we attached from Cyprus,' Biden said. 'I was hopeful that would be more successful.'

Eilat’s coral reefs in distress as sea temperatures soar, scienti...	The researchers found that during the summer, water temperatures in the Gulf of Eilat reached a record high of 31.9°C, with daily peaks consistently over 30°C for two months. By Pesach Benson, TPS The vibrant coral reefs in the Gulf of Eilat are showing signs of distress stemming from an unprecedented increase in seawater temperatures, Israeli scientists warned on Tuesday. For the first time, a significant bleaching event has been documented in this area, indicating the corals’ response to an unprecedented increase in seawater temperatures. Coral bleaching is a stress response that corals undergo when exposed to environmental changes, especially increases in water temperature. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with tiny algae called zooxanthellae that live inside their tissues. These algae give corals their beautiful colors and, more importantly, provide up to 90% of the energy corals need through photosynthesis. However, when the water becomes too warm, corals become stressed and expel these algae. Without the algae, the coral tissue becomes transparent, exposing the white skeleton underneath, which is why the process is called 'bleaching.' The bleached corals look pale or completely white. Prolonged heat stress can eventually lead to coral death. A study was conducted by Dr. Assaf Zebuloni, an ecologist specializing in the Gulf of Eilat at Israel’s Nature and Parks Authority, and researchers Dr. Yonatan Shaked and Prof. Maoz Fein from the Inter-University Institute of Marine Sciences in Eilat noted that the extreme temperatures observed this year disrupted the delicate balance that allows coral to thrive. The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed Ecology and Environment journal. The researchers found that during the summer, water temperatures in the Gulf of Eilat reached a record high of 31.9°C, with daily peaks consistently over 30°C for two months. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite data, the cumulative heat stress in the Bay of Eilat was 3.75 times the threshold that typically triggers severe bleaching events in other parts of the world. In the Gulf of Eilat, corals have developed a unique resilience, adapting to the warm waters of the southern Red Sea. But only heat-resistant corals have managed to migrate north to the Gulf of Eilat, where the borders of Israel, Egypt and Jordan converge. However, this summer’s temperatures may have surpassed the threshold for the corals. 'Even with the remarkable resilience of Eilat’s corals, it appears they, too, have a limit,' said Zebuloni. 'It’s likely that the reef system has reached a critical point this year.' Local factors further exacerbate the challenge. Excess nitrates in the northern Gulf of Eilat, discharged from Israeli desalination plants and aquaculture, have combined with the heat to threaten coral health. Elevated nitrate levels make corals more vulnerable to bleaching, according to Dr. Zebuloni. He warned that any increase in these pollutants could further endanger the coral reefs. 'The combination of high temperatures and nitrate pollution is critical to coral sensitivity,' he explained. 'Given the unpredictable frequency of heat waves and rising sea temperatures, the risk of severe bleaching events has intensified.' The Nature and Parks Authority is currently surveying the affected coral populations to assess the scale of the bleaching and determine recovery and mortality rates. While the damage thus far does not appear to be catastrophic, experts are cautious, noting that once a reef reaches a tipping point, recovery may be difficult or even impossible. The situation in Eilat could follow patterns seen in other parts of the world, where reefs subjected to sudden, extreme stress have struggled to rebound. 'Israel has a responsibility to safeguard this unique ecosystem,' said Dr. Zebuloni. 'Protecting these reefs is crucial for preserving their resilience and ensuring they remain an international asset for future generations.'

The looming terror threat in central Israel	They are gathering ammunition, drawing up plans and waiting for the opportune moment. The danger is massive, growing, and imminent,' says Naomi Kahn, director of Regavim’s International Division. By John Hasten, JNS Standing on the roof of her apartment building on the eastern tip of the central Israeli town of Rosh HaAyin, just meters away from the security barrier, Moriah Tzafar shares a grave concern. 'We see [Palestinian Authority] cars driving around, getting closer to us. What are they doing here? The area is a closed military firing zone [Zone 203]. We see them carrying out tours of the fence line. There are cars, people, illegal housing, and they’re getting closer. We report this every day to the authorities,' she says. 'It reminds us of the [female] IDF spotters overlooking the Gaza border. We didn’t listen to the spotters before Oct. 7, 2023, how is it possible the same concept still exists, that we are [still] relying on a fence?' Tzafar spoke during a press tour organized by the Regavim Movement this past Monday aimed at exposing security threats to Israelis living in the center of the country. The P.A. has constructed nearly 17,000 illegal structures within a kilometer of Israel’s security fence, which stretches roughly along the 1949 Armistice Line from the Gilboa area in the north down to Ein Gedi near the Dead Sea. According to Naomi Kahn, director of Regavim’s International Division, the security threat in the center of the country is pressing. 'The level of danger to Israelis living near the seamline is not a possibility, it is a reality. There have already been incursions and terrorist attacks in seamline communities and deep into Israel,' she told JNS. 'The level of danger is higher than we’d like to admit, as massive quantities of arms are coming in through Judea and Samaria [via Jordan] because the Gaza border is secured and northern border is in the process of being secured, so the Iranian proxies and anti-Israel forces are concentrating their efforts on the much longer and less protected seamline area,' she said. 'They are gathering ammunition, drawing up plans and waiting for the opportune moment. The danger is massive, growing, and imminent.' Kahn explained that during the Oslo Accords the seam line was created to prevent an Oct. 7-style scenario by forming a buffer zone and increasing Israel’s reaction time against a potential hostile invasion. However, despite the fact that it is illegal under international law to enter, build, plant, or make any physical changes within 500 meters of the security barrier, the P.A. constantly does so, she said. In 2002, during the height of the Second Intifada, the Israeli government began construction of the security fence along the seam line in an attempt to prevent terrorist incursions into the center of the country. However, according to Regavim, the state has ignored the P.A. attempts to annex Area C of Judea and Samaria, and no steps have been taken push back against the illegal encroachment on state lands, which includes the construction of 90,000 illegal structures in areas under full Israeli jurisdiction. At the same time, the security fence has be sabotaged repeatedly, to the point that many kilometers of the barrier have been completely demolished. Rani Gavriel, the head of Rosh HaAyin’s auxiliary neighborhood patrol unit, working with local police to try and keep the community safe, told JNS that, '6,000 Arabs pour into Israel illegally on a daily basis.' He described a constant battle against theft, sexual assault and terrorist attacks by Arabs who penetrate the seam line. 'The Arab’s best weapon is the olive tree,' he said. 'Even if the olives aren’t ready to be picked, they are in the fields using the trees as cover to carry out surveillance. These people are just like Hamas or Hezbollah. They openly say that Rosh HaAyin is theirs.' Gavriel said he has been warning of the threat for years, meeting with the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and Internal Security Committee back in 2021, but nobody is listening. 'Oct. 7 wasn’t an isolated incident,' he warned. 'We’re getting ready for the next one.' Accompanied by a military escort, the group was taken into the nearby Firing Zone 203, located just to the east in Samaria. Kahn explained that Israel set up many firing zones on state land following Israel’s withdrawal from Sinai under the 1979 peace agreement with Egypt. Despite the fact that these training areas are closed military zones, Kahn said the P.A. encourages Arabs to move into them in order to create the illusion that ancient Arab villages existed there. Firing Zone 203 is home to massive illegal construction, with beautiful villas and sports fields. E.M. (who asked that his name be withheld) the land protection officer for the Shomron Regional Council, who led the tour of the area, pointed out that we were traveling on a brand-new paved east/west route extending closer and closer to Rosh HaAyin. 'When we see the illegal construction we report it to the Civil Administration,' he told JNS. 'They are working, but not doing enough. It’s time to wake up, destroy the illegal construction and take a stand against the P.A., which is being funded by foreign entities.' In the firing zone, Barak Werker, CEO of the Green Now organization, focused on the environmental damage to the area caused by the P.A., which he said affects P.A. Arabs and Israelis alike. 'When it comes to environmental issues, there are no borders. The seamline doesn’t exist,' he said. Back in Rosh HaAyin, Moriah Tzafar had told the group her family suffers daily due to illegal burning of waste carried out by P.A. Arabs. 'We are forced to sleep with the windows closed every night' she explained. Werker stressed how the P.A. acts like a third world country, causing air pollution through illegal burns, especially of electronic waste, as well as water pollution by dumping raw sewage into streams. In his view, both Israel and the P.A. need to put politics aside, and one entity needs to be created to handle all environmental issues. Heading a bit further to the east in Samaria, the group was taken to the Avichai cattle farm, established on top of a hill on state land by Eitan Melet and his family more than a year ago. With clear views of Rosh HaAyin and Tel Aviv to the west, Melet told JNS, 'We are here protecting the seamline communities through a constant Jewish presence.' The Arab terrorists who carried out the 2022 terrorist attack in the city of Elad in which four Israelis were murdered, had set out from the area in which the farm is now located, he said, implying that the attack could have been prevented had there been an Israeli presence in the area at the time. 'Our purpose is to safeguard the land of Israel,' said Melet. When asked what Israel could do to increase security in the post-Oct. 7 reality, Kahn said, 'The government must treat our enemies as enemies. It must stop living under the false concept of enabling Arabs to come through and providing the Arabs with economic incentives not to attack us. We saw along the Gaza border that that is a completely false assumption, but that’s still an assumption that forms the basis of Israel’s policy. That has to be changed.' Israel, she continued, must 'take the P.A. at its word—it intends to create a Palestinian state in all of Judea and Samaria, and we have to look carefully at what the P.A. has done up till now with its security forces. A P.A. state will not be one that intends to live in peaceful coexistence. Dozens of Israelis have been murdered by the official P.A. police forces while hundreds have been wounded. Their security apparatus is aimed at us and is waiting simply for the opportune moment to unleash another Oct. 7 upon us,' she added. According to Kahn, 'Regavim is collecting the information and analyzing it and making sure our decision makers, most importantly our political leadership, understands what’s happening on the ground.' The organization also initiates lawsuits 'that force the government of Israel to take notice, respond and explain its failure to act. And through those court cases we expose the underlying misconceptions and dispel them. We propose alternatives to the failed paradigms that we see are still in operation and we try to encourage our politicians to act in our national interests by first and foremost treating our enemies like enemies,' she said.

Report: Netanyahu offering millions of dollars in cash rewards to...	Israeli prime minister pledging 'safe passage' out of Gaza and massive cash rewards to any terrorists holding captives who agrees to free hostages, according to report. By World Israel News Staff Israel is offering Gaza terrorists who are holding hostages captive large cash rewards and the promise of free passage out of the Gaza Strip for themselves and their families if they handover the hostages to Israel, Israel's Channel 12 reported Monday night. According to the report, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed security officials to offer a massive reward, totalling 'several million dollars' for each captive who is freed, along with guarantees of safe passage out of the Gaza Strip for any captors who agree to the deal. The prime minister reportedly authorized the offer to be made during a security meeting Monday night, following consultations on Sunday with Gal Hirsch, a IDF reserve Brigadier General tapped by the Israeli government to lead efforts aimed at securing the release of Israeli captives held in Gaza. On Tuesday, an Israeli official confirmed Monday night's report regarding the offer. Israeli intelligence currently estimates that only 51 out of 101 captives still held in the Gaza Strip are alive. During a closed-door session of the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in September, Netanyahu provided lawmakers with data gathered by the intelligence community regarding the condition of Israeli hostages in the Gaza Strip. Israel has officially declared 37 of the captives dead, though there is also information suggesting that at least 13 more have also died in captivity, though their deaths have not been confirmed. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken ripped the Hamas terror organization, saying the Gaza-based group is refusing to release even a small number of Israeli captives as part of a ceasefire deal. 'Hamas has once again refused to release even a limited number of hostages to secure a ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said, summarizing Blinken's comments from a call with Egypt's foreign minister.

Hamas used extensive cyber ops to crack IDF defenses before Octob...	Among the findings: Hamas hacked soldiers' phones, security cameras, to obtain sensitive information. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An IDF investigation into how Hamas knew so much about IDF bases and border security prior to its October 7 invasion is now complete, Channel 12 reported Monday evening, and the results are troubling. While there was no active betrayal by army personnel, security was not up to par, said the report. Hamas attained a great deal of information simply by going through social networks where soldiers posted pictures and statements about their bases and operational activities, with no oversight by any IDF department. This exposed both weaknesses that Hamas could exploit as well as provide the terrorists with targets to hit. For a full two years before the surprise attack in which 1,200 people were massacred, Hamas also broke into soldiers’ phones to obtain sensitive data by examining their photos and messages. The terrorists also set 'honey traps,' tempting soldiers to communicate with ostensible dates and thereby expose their phone numbers and contacts, or reveal information they shouldn’t. This specific phenomenon was publicized in the media, with the IDF clearly warning its troops not to fall for such attempts. In examining another aspect of information security, the researchers found that technical equipment bought from outside providers was hacked. This included thousands of base security cameras made in China, which Palestinian experts could break into in order to retrieve invaluable intelligence. Most of the report was classified, but a source familiar with its contents told the media outlet that 'The report was difficult and intense and &#8230; will lead to a dramatic change in the area of information security and how it is treated by the military.' Two other points mentioned in the broadcast but without any details due to their sensitivity was that the security of both senior IDF officers and of IDF bases was checked, and 'many shortcomings' were discovered that will 'necessitate great changes.' 'There needs to be an organizational transformation in the IDF but also a change of culture in order to change this behavior,' reporter Nir Dvori summed up. 'There’s no choice. It has to be a complete change, from one end to the other, with an entirely new system of information security.' The full IDF report will be presented in the coming days to Chief of Staff Lieut. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, he said.

Biden in talks with Saudis for security deal, leaving out Israeli...	Senior US and Saudi officials reportedly working to negotiate limited bilateral agreement, after Saudi Crown Prince rules out deal including peace with Israel in the immediate future. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration and the Saudi government are quietly negotiating a limited bilateral security agreement, setting aside long-standing aspirations for achieving a 'mega-deal' which would include normalized relations between Riyadh and Jerusalem, Axios reported Monday night. For years, Israel and Saudi Arabia have conducted closed-door talks aimed at reaching formal recognition between the two powers, extending the Abraham Accords and cementing acceptance of Israel by moderate, U.S.-aligned Arab states. The clandestine negotiations, brokered by the U.S., reached their apogee prior to last year's invasion of Israel by Gaza terrorists, after Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi prime minister and Crown Prince who is widely considered the de factor ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, came to the conclusion that a 'mega-deal' between Riyahd, Jerusalem, and Washington would only be politically viable during the Biden administration, Axios reported. The mega-deal would include not only the establishment of full diplomatic ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but also enhanced security cooperation between all three powers, a defense treaty between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, and a green-light to a Saudi civilian nuclear program. Following the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7th, however, bin Salman has ruled out a deal with Israel, reportedly saying that while an agreement could still be reached at a later date, it could not come until some time after Israel's war in Gaza has ended. According to a report by The Atlantic in September, when asked by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken what were the prerequisites for resuming efforts towards a normalization deal, bin Salman said that the war in Gaza must come to a conclusion and Israel leave Gaza. Now, according to Axios, the Biden administration and bin Salman are rushing to achieve a limited bilateral security agreement before the president leaves office on January 20th. The proposed agreement would not include provisions for a Saudi-Israeli deal, nor would it address Saudi Arabia's nuclear ambitions. Instead, the security agreement would be a scaled-down version of the treaty sought after as part of a mega-deal, and would be modeled on agreements inked between the U.S. and Gulf states including Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, cementing each's status as American allies. 'Saudi Arabia is part of that and likely to also have something,' one of three sources quoted by the report said. All three sources said that Saudi national security adviser Musaad bin Mohammed al-Aiban met with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and senior Biden advisers Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein during a visit to the White House last week. The sources claimed that during the meeting, the three discuss possible bilateral agreements aimed at strengthening ties with regard to security, technology, and trade.

Biden admin: Hamas unwilling to release even a handful of Israeli...	Biden administration blasts Hamas, says the terror group consistently refusing to release even a small number of Israeli captives in order to secure a ceasefire to provide relief to Gaza civilians. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration slammed the Hamas terror organization Monday, accusing the Gaza-based group of refusing to compromise in hostage deal talks. On Sunday, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone with his Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, to discuss the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, and efforts to secure a ceasefire on both fronts. A day later, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller issued a statement to reporters summarizing Blinken's conversation with Abdelatty. According to Miller, during their conversation, Blinken expressed to Abdelatty the White House's frustration with Hamas over the terror group's recalcitrance in hostage deal talks, accusing it of ruling out the release of any number of Israeli captives in exchange for a temporary ceasefire. The Secretary noted that Hamas has once again refused to release even a limited number of hostages to secure a ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza,' Miller said. Blinken also 'discussed the importance of establishing a path for the post-conflict period that provides governance, security, and reconstruction' in the Gaza Strip. The two leaders also discussed efforts to 'promote a diplomatic resolution' between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group which 'would enable civilians on both sides of the blue line to return to their homes with safety and security.' The American Secretary of State reiterated the Biden administration's ambitions for permanently ending the current war in the Gaza Strip, 'securing the release of all hostages, and increasing and sustaining the delivery of humanitarian assistance.' On Monday, Israel's Channel 12 reported that Mossad Director David Barnea has expressed pessimism regarding the prospects for a hostage deal with Hamas, telling relatives of Israeli captives held in Gaza that the chances for even a small deal 'are low.' Israel has sought to achieve an interim deal with Hamas in the past few days, following the killing of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar in October. Such a deal, according to media reports, would include the release of roughly four or five Israeli captives, the freeing of dozens of jailed Arab terrorists, and a limited truce.

Haaretz blasts own publisher for calling Palestinian terrorists ‘...	Amos Schocken’s remarks at a London conference shocked subscribers, who left by the hundreds. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News In a rare display of self-criticism, the editorial board of one of Israel’s most prominent newspapers took its publisher to task Monday after he called Palestinian terrorists 'freedom fighters' and demanded international sanctions against Israel's government. Amos Schocken, who has headed the Haaretz newspaper for over two decades, had headed a list of speakers giving fiercely anti-government speeches at a London conference the paper sponsored last week about the 'day after' Israel’s war against the Hamas and Hezbollah terror organizations. He falsely accused the government of crimes such as 'imposing a cruel apartheid regime on the Palestinian population,' supporting 'ethnic cleansing' and committing a 'second Nakba' in 'part of Gaza,' using the Arab word for 'disaster,' which is what Israel’s enemies call its victory in the War of Independence. He also called for sanctions against the government and its leaders who oppose a Palestinian state, as 'the only way to achieve' this desired goal. The kicker, however, was when he said, 'It dismisses the costs [to] both sides for defending the settlements while fighting the Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls terrorists.' This last statement shocked Israelis of all stripes, even loyal readers of the decidedly left-wing daily, hundreds of whom promptly cancelled their subscriptions in protest. Many advertisers, too, showed their opposition by dropping their orders with the paper. Several government ministries announced that they would 'suspend all existing agreements' and refuse to work with the paper in the future as well due to his 'extreme, baseless and false statements.' Schocken tried walking back the reference, first saying 'To remove all doubt, Hamas are not freedom fighters. October 7 was a horrific event and I wrote in the paper that its initiators and perpetrators must be severely punished.' He then wrote, 'I have rethought what I said in London. Many freedom fighters in the world and throughout history, perhaps also on the way to establishing the State of Israel, carried out terrible terrorist acts and hurt the innocent to achieve their goals. I should have said: Using terrorism is illegitimate. I erred when I didn’t say this.' The paper’s editorial made clear that this kind of apology was not good enough. 'Even in his clarification, Schocken erred,' the article said inpart. 'Throughout history, nations have waged armed struggle against oppressive occupiers to liberate themselves and achieve independence; not every armed struggle is terrorism. 'But the term ‘freedom fighter’ has a positive, even romantic, connotation, which could lead people to support illegitimate acts of violence. Those should be unacceptable in any way, shape or form.' Referring to the butchery of the Hamas-led invasion that ended 1,200 lives, it also said, 'Any organization that advocates the murder of women, children and the elderly is a terrorist organization, and its members are terrorists. They certainly aren't ‘freedom fighters.’' Haaretz co-owner Leonid Nevzlin had already taken to social media Sunday to harshly criticize Schocken. 'His recent statements at the Haaretz conference in London are appalling, unacceptable, and even inhumane, displaying profound insensitivity toward the victims of that terrible day, the casualties of the ongoing war, the hostages and their families, and the people of Israel as a whole,' he wrote, in part on his X account.

Joe Rogan endorses Donald Trump	Podcaster and comedian Joe Rogan publicly endorses former President Donald Trump on eve of presidential election during interview with billionaire Elon Musk. By World Israel News Staff Joe Rogan, a comedian and host of the world's most popular podcast, publicly endorsed former President Donald Trump on the eve of Tuesday's presidential election. In an interview released late Monday night, Rogan hosted billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who has campaigned on behalf of Trump and spent over $120 million on a pro-Trump political action committee. Musk, estimated by Forbes to be the world's richest person with a projected net worth of $269.8 billion, is the second largest donor for the Trump campaign and aligned super PACs, after billionaire Timothy Mellon, and ahead of Miriam Adelson. During the podcast, which lasted nearly two-hours-and-forty-minutes, both Musk and Rogan repeatedly criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, with Musk warning that a Harris victory would likely spell the end of American democracy. In a post to X/Twitter debuting the episode, Rogan wrote that he agreed with Musk 'every step of the way' regarding Trump, before explicitly endorsing the former president. The great and powerful Elon Musk,' Rogan tweeted. 'If it wasn't for him we'd be f***ed. He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.' 'For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump. Enjoy the podcast.' Rogan's podcast with Musk comes on the heels of an interview with Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, which aired last October. Trump also appeared on Rogan's podcast on October 25th, garnering over 20 million views on Rogan's X/Twitter account, and 45 million on Youtube. 'I just received word about Joe Rogan's endorsement,' Trump said in a video statement released to TikTok early Tuesday morning. 'He's a fantastic guy. And it is a great honor to receive it.'

New law streamlines firing of pro-terror teachers in Israel	One idea can be more destructive than a thousand tanks,' says MK who co-sponsored bill that cuts funding to terror-supporting schools. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli Knesset passed a bill on Tuesday clamping down on terror-supporting teachers and educational institutions, following a number of scandals involving educators celebrating terror attacks. The bill paves the way for educators who post pro-terror content to be swiftly fired and to slash funding to schools that promote terror-supporting narratives. The new law ensures that teacher who 'identify with an act of terrorism in public or publish a direct call to commit an act of terrorism' can be fired with no advance notice. Educators who promote pro-terror narratives are welcome to teach 'in Tehran, Gaza or Ramallah today, but not in our schools,' said Likud MK Amit HaLevi, a co-sponsor of the bill. MK Tvika Fogel (Religious Zionism), who introduced the bill, stressed that teachers have tremendous influence over children and youth. The law, he said, ensures that educator and schools are held accountable for the narratives being promoted to students. In recent years, several schools in eastern Jerusalem held ceremonies commemorating Palestinian terrorists. Under the new law, these schools could lose their funding from the Education Ministry due to the pro-terror curriculum. 'The Knesset today is doing the most essential thing in the war against our enemies: damaging the strongest infrastructure of terrorism - education,' he said in a media statement. 'As we know, a bomb is not created and does not explode by itself. Its basic components are the brain and the heart, the consciousness of destruction, and the emotional fervor to carry it out, and these are created first of all in the educational system,' he continued. 'One teacher may raise dozens of ticking bombs every year. One idea can be more destructive than a thousand tanks.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paised the law as 'important' for 'ending terrorism,' and emphasized that the government will 'continue to fight terrorism in every way.'

American Airlines won’t fly to Israel again until at least Septem...	The Israeli carrier El Al is currently the only airline offering direct flights between the United States and Israel. By Andrew Lapin, JTA American Airlines announced over the weekend it would not be resuming flights to Israel until September 2025, extending an existing pause by an additional six months and potentially sparking a cascade of other airline delays in resuming regular Israel service. The move makes American Airlines the first United States-based carrier to push back flights to Israel until at least the second half of 2025, amid a swath of cancellations affecting most non-Israeli airlines. Delta and its partner airlines currently have pauses on Israel flights through March, while United Airlines has not set a return date yet for its own Israel flights. Many carriers suspended flights to Israel following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack and have delayed their return to the region citing renewed security concerns including the expansion of regional conflict into Lebanon and Iran. Others resumed flights after Oct. 7 but suspended them amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, which has included multiple missile barrages from Iran. The scarcity of flights and their frequent interruptions have made traveling to and from Israel an expensive, often madcap process. To manage costs, many travelers are opting to fly first to a European city that has budget service before connecting to their final destination — although several budget European airlines, including EasyJet and Ryanair, have also suspended service to Israel through at least spring 2025. The Israeli carrier El Al is currently the only airline offering direct flights between the United States and Israel. El Al’s effective monopoly on the service since Oct. 7 resulted in an investigation over price gouging and a change in policy that locked in flight rates to and from some European cities. In a statement, a spokesperson for American Airlines told the Jewish News Syndicate that customers who had already bought flights could get a full refund or exchange them for another airline.

Harris will not say how she voted on California’s tough-on-crime ...	Proposition 36 would increase penalties for individuals convicted of retail theft or drug crimes by reclassifying the offenses from misdemeanors to felonies. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Vice President Kamala Harris refused to say how she voted on California’s Proposition 36, a ballot measure that would impose harsher sentences for retail thefts and drug crimes in her home state, CNN reported. 'I am not going to talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election, and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it,' she told reporters in Detroit when asked about the proposition. Harris had been speaking of submitting her vote, saying, 'I actually just filled out my mail-in ballot.' Proposition 36 would increase penalties for individuals convicted of retail theft or drug crimes by reclassifying the offenses from misdemeanors to felonies. It also proposes to elevate repeat shoplifting and fentanyl-related offenses to felony status. The initiative would reverse sections of Proposition 47, a controversial criminal reform initiative approved by voters in 2014 that lessened the penalties for theft and drug crimes in California to reduce overcrowding in jails, according to CNN. Supporters of Proposition 36 include GOP lawmakers and commercial chain stores, such as Walmart, that have been victims of record-high shoplifting since the pandemic. Opponents of the measure include Democratic state leaders and social justice organizations that argue the proposal would unfairly imprison lower-class people and those with a history of substance abuse. Since launching her presidential campaign, Harris has emphasized her record fighting crime as a California prosecutor while attempting to downplay her progressive policies. Harris has refused to say if she supports various of her previously held positions involving crime, such as closing private prisons, allowing taxpayer-funded sex-change surgeries for prisoners, decriminalizing prostitution, and creating a path to citizenship for 'dreamers,' illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children.

Blood sugar levels play a key role in brain aging: Can diet slow ...	According to the study, individuals at risk for cognitive decline should prioritize blood sugar management through diet and lifestyle choices. By Pesach Benson, TPS The body’s blood sugar level is known to be linked to brain atrophy, and now findings from a team of international researchers suggest that dieting can slow the brain’s aging process. Age-related brain atrophy, characterized by the gradual loss of neurons and shrinkage of brain tissue, is an inevitable aspect of aging. This decline can lead to various cognitive impairments and neurological issues. While aging cannot be halted, the results from this 18-month dietary intervention suggest that adopting a healthier lifestyle can mitigate some effects of brain aging. Brain age, determined through MRI assessments of the hippocampus and lateral ventricles, reflects the brain’s biological aging, which may not always align with a person’s chronological age. As individuals age, the hippocampus tends to shrink while the lateral ventricles expand, serving as indicators of brain health. A younger brain age generally signifies better cognitive functioning, whereas an older brain age can signal increased vulnerability to cognitive decline. The study, conducted by a collaborative team of brain and nutrition experts, including researchers from Ben-Gurion University, Harvard University, and Leipzig University, was recently published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2024, a peer-reviewed journal. The research was primarily led by Ben-Gurion PhD student Dafna Pachter and supervised by Prof. Iris Shai. According to the study, individuals at risk for cognitive decline should prioritize blood sugar management through diet and lifestyle choices. The findings indicate that lower levels of HbA1c — also known as glycated hemoglobin — correlates with significant positive changes in specific brain regions commonly affected by aging. MRI results demonstrated that lower HbA1c levels were associated with greater changes in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum—key areas responsible for cognitive function, motor control, and sensory processing. The research suggests that improved blood sugar management could be a pivotal factor in decelerating age-related brain changes. Earlier studies have highlighted the advantages of the Green Mediterranean diet, which is rich in polyphenols derived from plant-based sources like Mankai (a high-protein aquatic plant) and green tea, while being low in red and processed meats. The study reinforces the notion that the Green Mediterranean diet not only promotes metabolic health but may also offer protective benefits for brain structure and function. The DIRECT PLUS trial, noted for being one of the longest and largest brain MRI intervention studies, involved around 300 participants divided into three dietary groups. Whole-brain MRI measurements were taken before and after the 18-month trial to assess changes in brain health. Using Hippocampal Occupancy (HOC) as a proxy for brain age, the study predicted future dementia risk. Interestingly, some participants displayed brain ages that were either younger or older than their chronological ages. Employing NeuroQuant, an FDA-authorized automated tool, the research team quantified and analyzed the MRI data. The goal was to examine the impact of dietary components and glycemic control on brain aging. Results indicated that participants who improved their blood sugar levels and achieved normal glucose status showed a more pronounced reduction in brain aging. Notably, those who incorporated higher amounts of green tea and Mankai duckweed shakes into their diets experienced the most significant improvements in both blood sugar regulation and brain health. Lead researcher Prof. Iris Shai of Ben-Gurion University explained, 'Maintaining low blood sugar levels, even within the normal range, shows promise for preserving a younger brain, especially when combined with a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Polyphenols in plant-based foods may cross the blood-brain barrier, reducing inflammation crucial for memory.' This study is among the first large-scale trials to establish a direct connection between dietary changes, particularly those related to the Green Mediterranean diet, improved glycemic control, and slower brain aging. While further investigation is necessary, the research could encourage healthcare professionals to integrate nutritional counseling into their practices, emphasizing the role of diet in mental wellness.

Will Iran attack Israel on Election Night?	This time the regime will likely use up to 400 missiles if not more,' says Iranian military analyst. By World Israel News Staff A prominent Iranian military analyst is warning that there is a high likelihood Iran will attack Israel on Tuesday, as the U.S. presidential election results are tallied, in order to generate maximum publicity. Dr. Farzin Nadimi, a Senior Fellow with The Washington Institute, wrote on his X account that he believes Iran may launch a massive attack on the Jewish State in the immediate future. 'The newest round in the Iranian regime-Israel long-range fires war is near, perhaps on Tuesday evening as polls close in the U.S., to overshadow the winner announcement. This time the regime will likely use up to 400 missiles if not more, aiming at disabling major Israeli air defenses,' Nadimi wrote. Aligned with recent reports that Iran will include previously unused weapons in this attack, Nadimi said he expects to see Tehran launch Khorramshahr-4 ballistic missiles, which have a 2,000 kilometer range, the hypersonic Fattah missile which can reporedly evade Israel's air defenses, the Emad precision ballistic missile, and the medium-range Kheibar Shekan medium-range ballsitic missile. The name of the last missile, the Kheibar, is a reference to a Muslim mass slaughter of Jews in Saudi Arabia during the first century. The Arash suicide drone is also likely to be used by Iran during the attack, Nadimi added. The analyst noted that some of Iran's ballistic missiles are actually located in Iraq, shortening the distance that the weapons need to travel to strike Israel. Earlier reports indicated that Iran may activate its proxy groups in Iraq to carry out the attack, in order to create plausible deniability and avoid an Israeli reliatory srike on Iranian soil. The U.S. warned Iran that should it launch an additional attack against Israel, it would not be able to prevent the Jewish State from striking Iran's nuclear development sites and oil assets. According to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv, the Israeli military is on high alert for a potential attack.

‘Credible threat’ – Iranian plot to kill IAF commander revealed	Iran was said to be asking the Israelis in its network to find an assassin who would be willing to murder the commander. By World Israel News Staff An Iranian plot to assassinate an Israeli Air Force commander has sent shockwaves throughout the military, with security officials providing the officer in question and his family a special security detail. Assigning personal security guards to a senior officer 'is not a standard procedure for everyone,' an anonymous Israeli official told Iran International, a news outlet affiliated with the anti-Islamic regime movement. 'Only those with a [credible] threat [against] them, such as the chief of staff, the Air Force chief' receive round-the-clock security, 'but now they put security on [the officer] and his family as he was exposed.' The plan was exposed after the Shin Bet busted an Iranian spy ring, which consisted of mostly Soviet-born Israelis who had been recruited on social media platform Telegram to pass intelligence to Tehran in exchange for payment. Iran was said to be asking the Israelis in its network to find an assassin who would be willing to murder the commander. A commander at the Nevatim Air Force base in Israel's south, who has not been officially identified by name, was reportedly the target of the assassination plot. Hebrew-language Channel 12 news claimed that the officer targeted by Iran is Brig. Gen. Yotam Sigler, the commander of Nevatim, but that has not been officially confirmed by the Shin Bet or military. 'The commander is a very wanted target because Nevatim is in itself so strong a target for Iran,' the Israeli official explained. Nevatim is one of the largest military bases in Israel, where fighter jets, stealth aircraft for intelligence gathering, and the Prime Minister's private jet, the Wing of Zion, are stationed. 'It’s not just fighters, it’s intelligence, it’s multi-disciplinary and a strategic base,' the source added. Iran targeted Nevatim in both its April and October on the Jewish State, which saw Tehran launch hundreds of explosive drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles at Israel. During the first attack in April, Nevatim only sustained minor damage. But following the October attack, satellite images revealed that serious damage had been inflicted upon runways at Nevatim, as well a hangar. In a statement, the IDF said the Iranian attack had damaged 'office buildings and other maintenance areas,' but stressed that no soldiers or aircraft were struck.

Gantz pressures Netanyahu: ‘Israel must be ready to destroy Irani...	Iran's attacks will ultimately end in damage to its military capabilities, collapse of its economy, and a popular revolt against power.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News National Unity Party chairman Benny Gantz had a message for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: Be ready to strike and eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities. At a party faction meeting, Gantz said, 'We will have to prepare politically, economically, and militarily for the destruction of Iran's nuclear facilities and to fight against its expansion.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Two incendiary devices transported by DHL were part of a Russian plot to start fires on cargo or passenger planes headed to the US and Canada, the Wall Street Journal reports. The current plot shows an escalation of previous suspected attacks in July when devices set fires at DHL logistics hubs in England and Germany. Since the incidents in July, security officials have been searching to find the culprit and have now determined that Russia was behind the planting of incendiary devices, according to the Wall Street Journal. The devices were electric massagers filled with a magnesium-based flammable substance, which would be difficult to extinguish if ignited on an airplane. Poland's National Prosecutor's Office has arrested four people in connection with the fires and has charged them with terrorist actions on behalf of a foreign intelligence agency. 'The group's goal was also to test the transfer channel for such parcels, which were ultimately to be sent to the United States of America and Canada,' the prosecutor's office said. Pawel Szota, the head of Poland's Foreign Intelligence Agency, said Russian agents were responsible for the plot to plant the devices, and if an attack had been put into action, it would represent a significant escalation from the incidents in the summer. Szota said, 'I'm not sure the political leaders of Russia are aware of the consequences if one of these packages exploded, causing a mass casualty event.' When the Wall Street Journal asked Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to comment on the incident, he replied, 'We have never heard any official accusations' of Russian involvement, adding: 'These are traditional unsubstantiated insinuations from the media.' European authorities have noted that Russia is behind an increasing number of cases of sabotage, including arson in the UK and Finland, tampering with pipelines and data cables in the Baltic, and interfering with water supplies in Sweden and Finland.
