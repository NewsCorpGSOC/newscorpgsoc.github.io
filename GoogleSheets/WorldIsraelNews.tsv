UAE's ambassador to the US denounces killing of Israeli-Moldovan rabbi who had served as emissary in Abu Dhabi, calling his murder a 'crime against the UAE.' By World Israel News Staff The United Arab Emirates on Sunday condemned the abduction and murder of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi last week, calling it a 'crime against the UAE.' Last Thursday, 28-year-old Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan, who served as an aide to the chief rabbi of the UAE and operated a kosher grocery shop in Abu Dhabi, was declared missing. Over the weekend, his body was found by UAE security personnel. According to a preliminary investigation, Kogan was abducted by three Uzbek nationals working on behalf of Iran before being murdered. 'Today the UAE mourns for Rabbi Zvi Kogan,' Emirati Ambassador to the United States Yousef Al-Otaiba said in a statement Sunday night. 'Our thoughts are with his family, friends and community over his senseless death. Zvi Kogan’s murder was more than a crime in the UAE - it was a crime against the UAE. It was an attack on our homeland, on our values and on our vision.' 'In the UAE, we welcome everyone. We embrace peaceful coexistence. We reject extremism and fanaticism of every kind. We honor Zvi Kogan’s memory by recommitting ourselves to these values.' 'Now, we are more determined than ever to protecting and sustaining the Emirates as a shining and enduring example of diversity, acceptance and peace.' The UAE is one of six Arab states with formal diplomatic ties to Israel, becoming the first of four countries to join the Abraham Accords with Israel in 2020. Also on Sunday, the UAE interior ministry announced that authorities had apprehended the three suspects wanted in connection with the murder of Rabbi Kogan. The ministry boasted that police had carried out the arrest 'in record time.'

El Al reports $1 billion in revenue, as foreign carriers avoid Is...	El Al raked in $1 billion in three-month period, while foreign airlines refrain from stating when they'll resume Israeli routes. By World Israel News Staff Israeli airline El Al recorded its highest-ever revenue and a major increase in its profits, as dozens of foreign airlines cancel routes to Israel, with no estimate of when they'll return. El Al recently announced that its third-quarter revenues reached $1 billion, a 44 percent increase from the same period in 2023. The carrier's net profits soared to $185 million, marking an increase of a staggering 258 percent. 'El Al has been operating in emergency mode for more than a year, and our goal is to ensure that the skies remain open between Israel and the world,' El Al CEO Dina Ben Tal Ganancia said in a media statement. 'Throughout the months of the war and especially in the current quarter, we continue to experience increased demand for El Al flights, which is significantly higher in relation to the seat capacity that the company is able to offer.' In recent months, El Al has faced serious criticism for price gouging, as the carrier is one of just a handful that continues to provide routes to and from the Jewish State during the ongoing war. Many foreign airlines have declined to state when they expect to resume their Israeli fights. Ganancia appeared to acknowledge that much of the company's record profits are due to the fact that the carrier essentially has a monopoly on flights to Israel. She stressed that El Al was pushed to the limit by the demand for flights, and urged foreign carriers to return to Israel in order to provide more options for those wishing to travel to and from the country. 'We make every operational effort to increase the supply of seats as much as possible, in order to find solutions and serve the public traveling from and to Israel, but for the moment we don’t have any substantial capacity to add additional flights and therefore everything needs to done for foreign airlines to resume their operations to Israel,' she said. 'Otherwise passenger demand will not stabilize and the problem will only get worse,' she added.

Israel signals agreement to ceasefire proposal in Lebanon	Multiple reports indicate Jerusalem has signaled its approval of an American-backed truce between Israel and Hezbollah, accepting the core provisions of the draft deal. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli government has given preliminary approval to an American-backed ceasefire proposal to end the fighting in Lebanon, multiple Hebrew-language media outlets reported overnight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held multiple meetings with senior officials Sunday, and according to reports by Ha'aretz, Yedioth Aharanoth, and Kan, has agreed in principle with the ceasefire proposal presented last week by Biden administration special envoy to the Middle East Amos Hochstein. Hochstein visited Israel last week and met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, following his trip to Beirut, where he met with Lebanese leaders, including Speaker of the Lebanese parliament Nabih Berri. A leader of the Shi'ite movement Amal, Berri has served as an interlocutor for talks between the U.S. and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist organization. Following Hochstein's visit to Lebanon last week, Hezbollah secretary-general Naim Qassem said that Hezbollah had reviewed the proposed ceasefire, issued its response to Hochstein, and that the matter was now up to Israel. Hochstein reportedly pressed top Israeli officials over the weekend, warning them that this marks the administration's final attempt to broker a ceasefire, and that a rejection by Jerusalem would end efforts by the Biden White House to bring the two sides to a deal. Netanyahu has reportedly agreed in principle to the ceasefire deal, and is now mulling how to present the decision to the Israeli public. While the ceasefire deal has yet to be finalized and some key sticking points remain, it would reportedly include three major provisions, and would be implemented in three stages. According to reports last week, under the American proposal, Hezbollah would be required to withdraw its forces away from the Israeli border and north of the Litani River, with the terrorist group also obligated to disarm, in keeping with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Secondly, a U.S.-led committee would be tasked with ensuring compliance with the ceasefire. Finally, Israel would retain the right to respond militarily in Lebanon to violations of the ceasefire, but only after the committee exhausts other avenues for restoring the peace. In the first stage of the deal, a ceasefire would be imposed during which Hezbollah would withdraw from the southern bank of the Litani River. Afterwards, Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanese territory. In the third and final stage, Israel and Lebanon would enter into talks regarding contested border areas.

Iran ‘immediately’ accelerating nuclear program to ‘punish’ IAEA	We will significantly increase our uranium enrichment capacity,' says spokesman for Iran's nuclear development program. By World Israel News Staff Iran announced that it is 'immediately' activating advanced centrifuges for uranium enrichment, as a punitive measure after an international nuclear watchdog group criticized Tehran for refusing to cooperate with an oversight program. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently passed a resolution urging Iran to be more transparent in regards to its nuclear development program, calling on the country to allow IAEA inspectors to visit and monitor its nuclear sites. That resolution sparked outrage among Iran's senior leadership, who released a statement indicating that it would ramp up nuclear development as an act of defiance against the IAEA. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran's reciprocal response to this political misuse of the [IAEA] Board of Governors was immediately put into action, and the deployment of a set of new and advanced centrifuges has begun,' Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf told Iran International. Ghalibaf described the resolution as 'anti-Iran' and 'harmful,' and claimed that it was an 'unjust' decision against Iran's 'peaceful' nuclear program. 'We will significantly increase our enrichment capacity, deploy various advanced machines, and enhance the speed of industrial research and development for each machine,' Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said in a Farsi-language TV interview. 'Our infrastructure will be strengthened, and security measures will be improved through other actions,' he added. Despite Iran's decision to ramp up its nuclear program rather than allow international inspectors at its site, some countries are still urging Tehran to return to the negotiation table, with the goal of returning to the 2015 nuclear deal. 'We note with serious concern Iran's announcement&#8230; that, instead of responding to the resolution with cooperation, it plans to respond with further expansion of its nuclear program in ways that have no credible peaceful rationale,' the United States, Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement released by the U.S. State Department. 'We expect Iran to reengage on the path of dialogue and cooperation with the agency.'

‘Murdered simply for being Jewish’: Outraged Israelis grieve murd...	According to Israeli media reports, the killers are thought to be Uzbek nationals working on behalf of Iran who fled to Turkey. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Israelis reacted with outrage and grief in reaction to the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan in the United Arab Emirates. Emirati authorities found his body on Sunday after he disappeared on Thursday. 'Antisemitism is not just a thing of the past. Hatred of Israel is a plague that is rampant around the world today,' said Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar in response to the murder. 'I mourn with sorrow and outrage the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan,' tweeted President Isaac Herzog. 'This vile antisemitic attack is a reminder of the inhumanity of the enemies of the Jewish people,' Herzog noted, adding that the murder 'will not deter us from continuing to grow flourishing communities in the UAE or anywhere – especially with the help of the dedicated commitment and work of the Chabad emissaries all over the world.' According to Israeli media reports, the killers are thought to be Uzbek nationals working on behalf of Iran who fled to Turkey. Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli blamed Iran. 'The horrific murder of Chabad emissary Zvi Kogan, may his blood be avenged, is a criminal, antisemitic terrorist act for which the terrorist state of Iran is responsible. It is our duty to overthrow this regime, the root of evil in the Middle East,' Chikli said. Dr. Yoel Guzansky, Head of the Gulf Program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), criticized the United Arab Emirates for its reluctance to refer to the event as an antisemitic terror attack or blame Iran. 'The UAE government seeks to downplay the murder of the Chabad emissary,' Guzansky said. 'They are not rushing to blame Iran due to the improving relations between the two countries.' A statement by the Emirati Foreign Ministry released on Saturday only referred to Kogan as a 'missing Moldovan citizen.' It made no reference to Kogan’s Israeli nationality, nor did it identify him as a rabbi. 'This incident damages their image and could harm tourism from Israel,' Guzansky added. Amid a major spike in attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets worldwide since Hamas’s October 7 massacres, Israel has issued travel warnings for countries across the Middle East. Israel and the UAE signed the Abraham Accords in September 2020.

Israeli police thwart large ammo transfer to Samaria terrorists	The majority of the weapons smuggled into Judea and Samaria are small arms and assault rifles, analysts said. By JNS Officers of the Israel Police’s Northern District over the weekend seized a shipment of more than 20,000 bullets intended for 'terrorist elements in Judea and Samaria,' the police announced in a statement on Sunday. Two residents of Ma’ale Iron, a local council that consists of five Arab Israeli villages near Megiddo, were arrested. The suspects, aged 22 and 35, were pulled over by officers on Friday in the area of the Megiddo Junction, located a mere minutes’ drive away from the Samaria security barrier. Both men were detained for questioning by security services. The Israel Police said, 'This massive seizure, worth hundreds of thousands of shekels, is another success of the Northern District in locating the sources of illegal arms and eliminating smuggling routes.' שוטרי היחידה המרכזית של מחוז צפון איתרו משלוח תחמושת שיועד לפי החשד לגורמי טרור ביו'ש, ובו למעלה מ-20,000 כדורים מסוגים שונים - שני חשודים נעצרו pic.twitter.com/0ymYql0qPf &mdash; משטרת ישראל (@IL_police) November 24, 2024 Iran continues to instigate terrorism in Judea and Samaria by flooding the area with weapons, The New York Times reported in April, citing American, Israeli and Iranian officials. The majority of the weapons smuggled into Judea and Samaria are small arms and assault rifles, analysts said. However, U.S. and Israeli officials said that the Islamic Republic is also smuggling in advanced weaponry, including anti-tank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades. In the first six months of 2024, Judea and Samaria saw more than 500 Arab terrorist attacks each month on average, according to data made public by Hatzalah Judea and Samaria (Rescuers Without Borders). During that period, first responders recorded 3,272 acts of terrorism in the region, including 1,868 cases of rock-throwing, 456 attacks with Molotov cocktails, 299 explosive charges and 109 shootings. Terrorists murdered 14 people and wounded more than 155 others in Judea and Samaria between January and July, the rescue group said.

Israeli gov’t severs ties with paper over publisher’s controversi...	The controversy erupted when the paper’s publisher, Amos Schocken, described Palestinian terrorists as 'freedom fighters' while addressing a Haaretz conference in London on Oct. 27. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli government is severing ties with the Haaretz daily over the publisher’s controversial remarks about Palestinian terrorists, Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi announced on Sunday. 'We will not allow a reality in which the publisher of an official newspaper in the State of Israel will call for the imposition of sanctions against it and will support the enemies of the state in the midst of a war and will be financed by it,' Karhi said. 'We advocate a free press and freedom of expression, but also the freedom of the government to decide not to fund incitement against the State of Israel,' he added. The measure means the government will 'sever any advertising relationship with the newspaper Haaretz and calls on all its branches, ministries and bodies, as well as any government corporation or body funded by it not to have contact with the Haaretz newspaper in any form and not to publish any publications in it.' The controversy erupted when the paper’s publisher, Amos Schocken, described Palestinian terrorists as 'freedom fighters' while addressing a Haaretz conference in London on Oct. 27. 'The [Benjamin] Netanyahu government doesn’t care about imposing a cruel apartheid regime on the Palestinian population. It dismisses the costs to both sides for defending the [West Bank] settlements while fighting the Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls terrorists.' Schocken later issued a clarification, saying he should have expressed himself differently. 'As for Hamas, they are not freedom fighters,' Schocken wrote. Haaretz‘s editorial board distanced itself from the publisher’s remarks. The left-wing daily often publishes content critical of the Israeli government’s policies towards the Palestinians. The Schocken family has controlled Haaretz since 1937 when Salman Schocken, a German-Jewish publisher and businessman, acquired the newspaper. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

The LAF post in the Southern Lebanese village of Al-Amiriya on the Al-Qalila-Tyre road was severely damaged by the strike, the LAF claimed in a statement. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces issued an apology on Sunday after one Lebanese soldier was killed and 18 were wounded, some of them seriously, in an Israeli airstrike on a Lebanese Armed Forces position in Southern Lebanon. 'The incident took place in an area where fighting is ongoing against the Hezbollah terror organization,' the Israeli military confirmed in a statement in response to a query by local media. 'The IDF regrets the incident and clarifies that it is fighting in a targeted manner against the Hezbollah terror organization, and not against the Lebanese Army,' the statement continued, noting that the incident remains under investigation. The LAF post in the Southern Lebanese village of Al-Amiriya on the Al-Qalila-Tyre road was severely damaged by the strike, the LAF claimed in a statement. Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily in support of Hamas since Oct. 8, 2023, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones. The cross-border attacks from Southern Lebanon have killed 76 people in the Jewish state, including 31 IDF soldiers and six foreign nationals, and have wounded 729 more, 66 of them seriously.

‘None of them will get away’ – Netanyahu vows Israel will ‘deal’ ...	Israel's prime minister vows to 'deal with' murderers of Rabbi Zvi Kogan - as well as 'those who dispatched them,' in a veiled threat against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Sunday that Israel would bring the killers of a rabbi serving in the United Arab Emirates to justice - as well as their handlers, in a veiled threat to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. On Sunday, the Prime Minister's Office and Israel's Foreign Ministry issued a joint statement announcing that authorities in the UAE had found the body of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a 41-year-old Israeli-Moldovan dual citizen who had been serving as a Chabad emissary in Abu Dhabi, where he ran a kosher grocery store. At the weekly government meeting Sunday, Netanyahu expressed 'deep outrage' over the killing, which he described as 'an abhorrent antisemitic terrorist attack.' During the meeting, Netanyahu offered his 'heartfelt condolences to the Kogan family,' while pledging that Israel would bring the murderers to justice - along with 'those who dispatched them,' hinting at a possible reprisal against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. 'On your behalf, I also send heartfelt condolences to the Kogan family. The State of Israel will use all means, and will deal with these murderers, and those who dispatched them, to the fullest extent of the law. None of them will get away.' The prime minister also addressed claims by Hamas that a female hostage was recently killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza. Netanyahu emphasized that Israel is 'checking the information,' while adding that 'at this stage' it 'cannot be verified.' Reiterating previous statements, Netanyahu offered $5 million in cash, along with promises of safe passage, to any Gazan who frees an Israeli hostage, while vowing that any terrorists who harm hostages 'will pay the price.' 'Whoever dares to harm the lives of our hostages – will pay the price. I also said and I repeat: Whoever brings a hostage alive out of Gaza will receive $5 million; others who bring valuable information will also be compensated.' 'I appeal to the residents of Gaza: You can choose life and ensure your future and that of your families, or you can cling to death and destruction. The choice is yours; choose life.'

9 injured as Hezbollah pounds central and northern Israel	160 rockets and missiles launched at major Israeli cities in central and northern Israel, with hits reported in Petah Tikva, Kfar Blum, and Haifa. By World Israel News Staff At least nine people were injured Sunday, including one victim in serious condition, when Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon fired roughly 160 rockets and missiles at northern and central Israel during two waves of major attacks by the Iranian-backed terror group Sunday. The latest wave of rocket attacks began at just before 1:00 p.m. Sunday, with warning sirens sounded in cities and towns across central Israel including Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak, Petah Tikva, Rosh Ha'ayin, Hod HaSharon, Ramat Gan, Givat Shmuel, Elad, Kfar Qassem, Ramat HaSharon, Ra'anana, and Kfar Saba. Sirens were sounded minutes later in northern Israel, including in and around Haifa, Nahariya, Kiryat Shmona, Meron, Kfar Blum, and Maalot. Hezbollah rockets were also launched Sunday morning at towns in northern and central Israel. In total, at least nine people were injured in the rocket attacks Sunday, including a 51-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man injured in a rocket attack on the northern town of Maalot Tarshiha Sunday morning. United Hatzalah and Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency first responders were called to the scene in Maalot Tarshiha to treat the victims and evacuate them to local hospitals. The female victim was lightly wounded by shrapnel from a rocket, United Hatzalah reported, while the male victim suffered a moderate head injury while rushing to a bomb shelter. At just before 1:00 p.m., four people were injured when a rocket struck the central Israeli city of Petah Tikva. One of the victims, a 70-year-old woman, is listed in moderate condition after she suffered from smoke inhalation from the rocket impact. In addition, a 20 year old man suffered mild injuries from the blast of the rocket impact, while United Hatzalah emergency first responders Doron Shafir and Shlomo Feder treated a man and a woman in their 60s who had been wounded by shrapnel from the rocket. A man roughly 60 years of age was seriously wounded from shrapnel after a rocket struck in the northern town of Kfar Blum at approximately 2:00 p.m., while two others were injured in a rocket strike on the northern coastal city of Haifa.

Israelis urged to cancel trips to UAE, exercise caution in Thaila...	Israel's National Security Council issues new travel warnings for United Arab Emirates and Thailand, calling on Israelis to avoid the UAE if possible, and to exercise caution when traveling to Thailand. By World Israel News Staff Israel's National Security Council is calling on Israeli travelers to cancel all non-essential trips to the United Arab Emirates, and advising travelers exercise caution when visiting Thailand. The NSC issued a pair of new travel warnings over the weekend, updating the travel advisory status for Israelis visiting Thailand and the UAE. While the NSC emphasized that the updated advisory guidelines for travel to Thailand were not based on any new concrete threats, the travel warning to the UAE was issued just days after Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a 41-year-old Chabad emissary with dual Moldovan and Israeli citizenship and assistant to the chief rabbi of the UAE, was reported missing. Rabbi Kogan's remains were found by UAE security personnel over the weekend, after he was abducted and murdered by agents working on behalf of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The UAE is now ranked as a level 3 risk for Israeli travelers, the NSC said, according to which Israelis are advised to cancel non-essential trips to the UAE. 'And for those who are in the country—take extra precautions,' the advisory alert reads, including the removal of any outward signs of Jewishness or Israeli citizenship. 'Remain extra vigilant, and pay attention to your surroundings; If you are concerned that you have been exposed to a terrorist incident, inform the security forces; In major cities, or locations where demonstrations or protests are taking place, conceal anything that could identify you as Israeli or Jewish.' Regarding travel to Thailand, the NSC urged Israelis visiting the country to avoid attending large events identified with Israel, and concealing their Jewish and Israeli identity.

US senator threatens sanctions on allies over arrest warrants for...	South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham puts Canada, Britain, and other US allies on notice that cooperation with ICC in efforts to arrest Israeli leaders will lead to harsh American sanctions. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff A senior United States senator warned American allies not to cooperate with the International Criminal Court at The Hague in its effort to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud), threatening to impose sanctions on states which honor the arrest warrants. Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of two Republicans representing South Carolina, castigated the International Criminal Court Saturday over its decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant over their handling of the war against the Hamas terror organization, claiming there was sufficient evidence of violations of international law to justify their arrests. 'Israel is in a fight for its very life,' Graham told Fox News. 'The Jewish state is under siege from Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran has directly attacked Israel. And we live in an upside-down world where the prime minister of Israel and the defense minister of Israel are being prosecuted by a court in Belgium.' Graham also ripped the court on technical grounds, both for granting state standing to the Gaza Strip and for taking action against a state, Israel, which is not a party to the Rome Statue of the ICC. 'The court ruled that Gaza is a state – no, there is no Palestinian state under international law. And Israel is not a member of the International Criminal Court, and neither are we.' 'This is an antisemitic body and this court is to literally put in jail the prime minister of Israel and the defense minister for [Israel] defending itself from multiple terrorist organizations.' The senator warned American allies, including Canada and Britain, that any attempt to enforce the ICC arrest warrants would prompt the U.S. to impose sanctions which would 'crush' their economies. 'If you are going to help the ICC, as a nation, enforce their arrest warrant against Bibi and Gallant…I will put sanctions on you as a nation. You are going to have to pick either the rogue ICC versus America.' 'I’m working with Tom Cotton to have legislation passed as soon as we can to sanction any country that aides and abets the arrest of any politician in Israel.' 'To any ally: Canada, Britain, Germany, France – if you try to help the ICC, we’re gonna sanction you.' 'We should crush your economy because we’re next. Why can’t they go after Trump or any other American president under this theory?' On Thursday, Graham took to X to respond to the ICC ruling, calling the decision to issue the arrest warrants 'rogue and politically motivated.' 'I cannot emphasize enough my strong objection to what the ICC has done to the State of Israel.' 'The ICC is a rogue and politically motivated organization that is trampling on the very concept of the rule of law. I made it abundantly clear that I believe this entire process is an abuse of the Rome Statute.' 'I am confident that President Trump understands that the Court’s actions against Israel sets the foundation for the ICC to come after the United States one day. We must respond forcefully to the Court for our own good.' 'Any nation or organization that aids or abets this outrage should expect to meet firm resistance from the United States, and I look forward to working with President Trump, his team, and my colleagues in Congress to come up with a powerful response.'

Hezbollah’s war costs Israel’s north 5 billion shekels and counti...	Meanwhile, business closures and agricultural destruction have cost a crippling 4 billion shekels. By Jewish Breaking News 'Once-bustling streets in northern Israel now sit empty, farms lie fallow, and thousands of displaced families wonder if they’ll ever return home. After thirteen months of relentless attacks by Hezbollah, this formerly prosperous region has been brought to its knees – to the tune of 5 billion shekels ($1.35 billion). According to Israel’s Tax Authority, direct property damage alone has reached 1.5 billion shekels due to the thousands of missiles and rockets that have destroyed hundreds of homes, schools, and community centers across Israel’s northern frontier. Meanwhile, business closures and agricultural destruction have cost a crippling 4 billion shekels. Although Israeli communities along the Lebanese border bear the brunt of Hezbollah’s attacks, the financial bleeding has spread nationwide. A single Hezbollah missile strike in central Israel’s Hod HaSharon damaged 2,000 apartments, and another strike in northern Tel Aviv last week caused damage estimated at 50 million shekels. The government’s compensation fund is struggling to keep pace. They’ve already paid out 2 billion shekels to desperate business owners and displaced families, with another 2 billion on deck for the coming months. Iran’s October missile barrage alone triggered 2,500 claims worth 150 million shekels, including damage to an Air Force base. However, while the IDF pours billions into defending itself, the human toll of Hezbollah’s rain of missiles cuts much deeper than any balance sheet – forcing Jewish families to abandon homes their grandparents built, leaving ghost towns where vibrant communities once stood.

Israel strikes Hezbollah assets at Syria-Lebanon crossing	The Israeli Air Force struck the crossing last month and has conducted several other attacks on the Syrian-Lebanese border in recent months in an attempt to prevent Hezbollah from rearming. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Sunday morning that it had conducted airstrikes in Syria overnight near a border crossing with Lebanon used by the Hezbollah terrorist group to smuggle weapons. Israeli warplanes attacked terrorist infrastructure adjacent to the Jousieh border crossing in Lebanon’s northern Beqaa area, which is under the control of the Syrian regime and operated by Syrian security forces. מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר, בהכוונת אגף המודיעין, תקפו אמש, באופן ממוקד, תשתיות צבאיות סמוכות למעבר הגבול ג׳וסיה שבצפון הבקעא. תשתיות אלו משמשות את ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה להעברת אמצעי לחימה מסוריה ללבנון >> pic.twitter.com/xRFm5lskms &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 24, 2024 Syria’s state-run SANA news agency reported on the strikes on Saturday night.

One in three Oct. 7 victims came to hospital in critical conditio...	The study by health policy researchers also emphasized the critical need to expand rehabilitation services in Israel. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A whopping one third of October 7 victims came to hospital in critical condition, said a study by health policy researchers revealed last week that examined the resources, or lack of them, that were exposed in Israel’s medical system following the day Hamas-led terrorists invaded the country. The study that was presented at a conference of the Israel National Institute for Health Policy Research (INIHPR) also noted that fully 70% of those rushed to hospital required at least one operation. The data showed that 630 people were hospitalized, with 90% of them bearing gunshot wounds, and 16% suffering from multiple types of injuries, including burns and blast wounds. The unprecedented number of serious casualties overwhelmed the two hospitals that were the initial intake centers on October 7, Soroka Hospital in Beer Sheva and Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon. The researchers said that their data showed that there is a critical need to upgrade infrastructure at Israeli hospitals in general, and add more operating rooms and imaging machines in particular to enable better and faster care of patients during mass casualty events. They also noted that fully half of all the injured were later transferred for rehabilitation and that the health care system must be revised and equipped to handle such numbers. 'The immense demand for rehabilitation resources in such a short timeframe necessitates rapid reorganization of existing medical facilities to accommodate the high number of patients requiring rehabilitation,' the researchers noted. There have been several reports over recent months on the response of the country’s medical system to the wounding of some 3,400 people on October 7 itself as well as the steadily climbing numbers due to the ongoing war in both the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. These included the issues covered in the study, both leveling criticism and providing recommendations for the future. For example, an August report by the Ministry of Defense stated that since October 7,2023, over 10,000 war wounded have been registered in the ministry’s Rehabilitation Division, with more than a thousand new cases coming in each month. Of them, more than a quarter are soldiers complaining of psychological issues such as anxiety and PTSD as a result of their war experiences. According to the forecast of the Rehabilitation Division, by the year 2030, 100,000 IDF disabled persons will be treated in the division, with half of them dealing with mental injuries. The ministry’s director general, Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Eyal Zamir, called these figures 'an unprecedented [struggle to] cope, on a scale we’ve never known before&#8230;. Our predictions, with an emphasis on those dealing with post-trauma, require the immediate mobilization of all state bodies and resources. The faster we react, the more wounded we will be able to return to life.' The study’s authors included Prof. Eldad Katorza, head of the Gertner Institute for Epidemiology and Health Policy Research, and Dr. Ari Lipsky, head of the emergency department at HaEmek Medical Center.

A Jewish museum in Tulsa held a funeral for remains of Holocaust ...	Thornblad said the museum was 'unable' to perform any DNA testing that might have revealed the identities of the remains, but said that they had originally come from the Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps. By Andrew Lapin, JTA For decades a museum of Jewish art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, held the remains of several unidentified Holocaust victims in its collection. But last week the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art took steps to give those remains a proper home, by burying and holding a Jewish funeral for them. 'We are committed to preserving history in a way that respects human dignity,' Sofia Thornblad, the museum’s chief curator, told local news organizations. 'This burial is a testament to our dedication to honoring the memories of Holocaust victims and educating future generations about the importance of remembrance and ethical stewardship.' The museum said the remains likely dated back to before the year 2000, when it was more common for museums to accept human remains into their collections. Shifting priorities in the museum space have led to a reexamination of such practices. The Tulsa museum also includes an extensive collection of Holocaust-era artifacts donated by Jewish Oklahomans, including refugees from Nazi Germany. Thornblad said the museum was 'unable' to perform any DNA testing that might have revealed the identities of the remains, but said that they had originally come from the Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps. (Jewish groups including Operation Benjamin have invested considerable resources as of late into identifying and reburying World War II-era Jewish remains.) The Tulsa museum isn’t the only one to have taken steps to bury remains of Holocaust victims in its collection. In 2019 the Rockland Holocaust Museum and Center for Tolerance and Education, in Rockland, New York, announced it would hold a proper Jewish funeral for the ashes of victims of the Chelmno death camp it had recently discovered in its collection. The ashes had been donated in 2006 by a Holocaust survivor who’d gathered dirt from the camp, apparently without realizing it held the ashes of others. The same year, the Imperial War Museum in London also announced it had the remains of several Jewish death camp victims in its collection and would be giving them a Jewish funeral. The remains of five adults and a child, all murdered at Auschwitz, were donated in 1997 by a private donor; the museum’s decision to bury them on English soil marked the first time that Holocaust victims had been laid to rest in the United Kingdom, according to Museums Journal. The question of what to do with human remains has vexed museums in recent years, particularly when it comes to Native American remains. Decades after passage of a law urging tribal remains to be returned to their descendants, many museums had yet to act on their own collections, according to a ProPublica investigation last year. Those present at the Tulsa funeral last Thursday, held at a Jewish cemetery, included local rabbis, an archaeologist, and local descendants of Holocaust survivors. Thornblad was among those who took turns shoveling dirt into the grave, in accordance with Jewish custom.

‘Plug and play’: COVID-19 nasal spray’s nanotech could target can...	Instead of the mRNA-based approach used by the Moderna and Pfize pharmaceutical companies, the researchers identified two key amino acid sequences in the virus’s protein, synthesized them, and encapsulated them in nanoparticles. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli and Portuguese scientists unveiled a novel COVID-19 vaccine that is not only effective against all major variants but can be administered as a nasal spray and — unlike conventional vaccines — stored at room temperature. Moreover, the nano-technology behind it could be adapted for other infectious diseases and other personalized treatments. The innovative vaccine is the brainchild of a collaboration between Prof. Ronit Satchi-Fainaro’s lab at Tel Aviv University and Prof. Helena Florindo’s team at the University of Lisbon. Published in the peer-reviewed Advanced Science journal, the scientists utilized synthesized nanoparticles to effectively target the virus without relying on traditional mRNA technology. The nano-vaccine leverages a unique 200-nanometer particle to train the immune system to combat COVID-19 variants, from Beta to Omicron, with effectiveness comparable to existing vaccines. Instead of the mRNA-based approach used by the Moderna and Pfize pharmaceutical companies, the researchers identified two key amino acid sequences in the virus’s protein, synthesized them, and encapsulated them in nanoparticles. 'Our approach was inspired by a decade of work on cancer vaccines. When COVID-19 emerged, we adapted our platform to develop a vaccine that is not only effective but also highly accessible,' said Satchi-Fainaro. The nano-vaccine offers two major advantages over existing options. First, as a nasal spray, it can be self-administered, eliminating the need for needles or trained healthcare personnel. Second, its storage and transportation requirements are minimal. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require ultra-cold storage because of the inherent instability of mRNA, the molecule at the heart of these vaccines. mRNA is a single-stranded nucleic acid that is highly fragile and susceptible to degradation by environmental factors. In contrast, the nano-vaccine can be stored as a powder at room temperature. For use, the powder is mixed with saline to create the spray. This feature was tested through the European Union’s ISIDORe feasibility program, where the vaccine powder was shipped at room temperature to France for testing. The results demonstrated efficacy on par with Pfizer’s vaccine. The nano-vaccine platform has potential beyond COVID-19. It could be adapted for other infectious diseases, personalized cancer treatments, and chronic conditions like autoimmune disorders, the researcher explained. 'Our technology is not just a solution for COVID-19; it is a platform for future vaccines,' said Prof. Satchi-Fainaro. 'This plug-and-play method allows rapid adaptation to target other infectious diseases or even cancer.'

Two wounded as Hezbollah fires salvos at northern, central Israel	Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were sent running to shelters by the attack, which occurred at approximately 7:30 a.m. By JNS A woman was injured in waves of rocket attacks by the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah targeting northern and central Israel on Sunday morning. 'MDA medics and paramedics are providing medical treatment and evacuating a 51-year-old woman in mild condition with a shrapnel injury to her lower limbs to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya,' the Magen David Adom emergency medical service said. She was wounded from a direct hit to a factory in Ma’alot that caused extensive damage during what the Israel Defense Forces said was a 30-rocket barrage at the Upper and Western Galilees, only some of which were intercepted. תיעוד מהנפילה הישירה במפעל במעלותהשימוש נעשה לפי סעיף 27א' לחוק זכויות יוצרים pic.twitter.com/G99rhWvPTw &mdash; ישראל היום (@IsraelHayomHeb) November 24, 2024 Additionally, a man around 60 years old in Ma’alot sustained moderate injuries while making his way to a shelter, according to Channel 12. Another barrage of 25 rockets was subsequently launched at the Upper Galilee, according to the IDF, with some of the projectiles intercepted and other impacts in open areas. Sirens also sounded three times in the evacuated border town of Metula during the morning hours. Earlier in the morning, the Iranian terror proxy launched six rockets at central Israel, according to the IDF. Five of the rockets were intercepted and one fell in open territory. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were sent running to shelters by the attack, which occurred at approximately 7:30 a.m. and triggered sirens in the Dan, Sharon and Menashe regions, including the seaside cities of Netanya and Herzliya north of Tel Aviv. No injuries were reported, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency rescue service. Shortly after the barrage on central Israel, red alerts were also heard in Kiryat Shmona and Margaliot near the border with Lebanon, as well as in Safed and the surrounding area. Israel’s Channel 12 news reported that two rockets had been fired at Safed, causing no injuries or damage. Shortly before the barrage on central Israel, several drones were launched from Lebanon into Israeli territory, setting off sirens in the Galilee. Two of the UAVs were intercepted, according to the IDF, which confirmed that the incident had ended. Hezbollah has launched some 16,000 rockets, missiles and drones from Lebanon at Israel since joining the war in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the Gaza-based terrorist group’s massacre in southern Israel. Over 60,000 residents of northern Israel remain internally displaced due to the ongoing rocket and drone attacks from Lebanon, which have caused widespread material damage and multiple deaths and injuries.

Missing Chabad rabbi found murdered	Abu Dhabi rabbi murdered after being abducted by pro-Iranian agents, says Israeli prime minister's office. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A Chabad rabbi serving as an emissary in Abu Dhabi has been found dead, days after he went missing, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office and Israeli Foreign Ministry announced in a joint statement Sunday morning. Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a 41-year-old dual citizen of Israel and Moldova, had been serving as an aide to Rabbi Levi Duchman, chief rabbi of the United Arab Emirates, and operated a kosher supermarket in Abu Dhabi, where he and his wife were residing. On Thursday, Rabbi Kogan went missing, leading to fears over the weekend that he had been abducted by operatives working on behalf of Iran. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) issued a statement claiming responsibility for the abduction. 'As part of the first stage of Operation 'Ensuring Truth 3,' and in fulfillment of their promise in response to Zionist aggression on Iranian lands and violations of Iranian sovereignty, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards have declared full responsibility for the abduction of the Israeli extremist Rabbi Tzvi Kogan.' Israel announced Sunday that Rabbi Kogan's body has been located by UAE authorities, stating that he had been murdered in an 'act of antisemitic terrorism.' 'The UAE intelligence and security authorities have located the body of Zvi Kogan, who has been missing since Thursday, 21 November 2024,' the Israeli Prime Minister's Office and Foreign Ministry said. 'The Israeli mission in Abu Dhabi has been in contact with the family from the start of the event and is continuing to assist it at this difficult time; his family in Israel has also been updated.' 'The murder of Zvi Kogan, of blessed memory, is an abhorrent act of antisemitic terrorism. The State of Israel will use all means and will deal with the criminals responsible for his death to the fullest extent of the law.' Initial reports indicate Rabbi Kogan was murdered after being abducted by three Uzbeki nationals working on behalf of Iran's IRGC. Israeli President Isaac Herzog eulogized Rabbi Kogan in a statement Sunday morning. 'I mourn with sorrow and outrage the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan. This vile antisemitic attack is a reminder of the inhumanity of the enemies of the Jewish people.' 'It will not deter us from continuing to grow flourishing communities in the UAE or anywhere - especially with the help of the dedicated commitment and work of the Chabad emissaries all over the world.' 'I thank the UAE authorities for their swift action, and trust they will work tirelessly to bring the perpetrators to justice. Our thoughts and condolences are with Rabbi Kogan’s wife and family. May his memory be a blessing.'

Netanyahu on leak case: ‘Shin Bet abusing suspects to punish me’	Premier says he is 'shaken' by the Shin Bet violating suspects' 'basic rights as citizens' in leak case. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Shin Bet security agency of engaging in a 'witch hunt' and the Israeli military of hiding 'critical' intelligence from him, in a fiery nine-minute-long video addressing the recent indictment filed against one of his aides. Eli Feldstein, an officer in the military reserves who worked as as an advisor to Netanyahu, reportedly brought a Hamas document to the premier's attention that had previously not been presented to the prime minister. The document, written by a mid-level Hamas member, outlined the terror organization's strategy of psychological warfare, including encouraging hostage protests in order to exacerbate divisions within Israeli society. After presenting the document to Netanyahu, Feldstein allegedly leaked its contents to a German newspaper. Several months later, he and a non-commissioned military officer, who has not been named publicly, were arrested by the Shin Bet. For more than one month, Feldstein has been held in isolation, and has been denied access to an attorney. He was recently moved to suicide watch, after a noose was said to have been discovered in his cell. Feldstein is being charged with leaking classified information in an attempt to harm state security. If convicted, he cold face a life sentence. 'This reality, in which young people are held like the worst terrorists, handcuffed for days, days in which they are prevented from accessing their lawyers, and violating their basic rights as citizens, shakes me,' Netanyahu said in the video statement, which was posted to his X account. Defending Feldstein, he described his former aide as a 'passionate Zionist and patriot,' adding that 'there is no chance in the world that he would intentionally do anything to harm state security.' Netanyahu questioned why the document regarding Hamas' strategy was never presented to him. 'Was this document supposed to be on my desk? Why didn’t it reach me? This isn’t the first time critical information hasn’t been delivered to me,' he said. The premier noted that there had been a number of high-profile leaks since the onset of the October 7th war, including those that had revealed sensitive details regarding Israel's military capabilities, but nobody was arrested or even questioned in those cases. 'It doesn’t take a genius to understand why there was no investigation into these leaks,' Netanyahu said. 'The public isn’t foolish. And now, we have a single investigation into one leak regarding a document that exposes Hamas's strategy to divide Israeli society and pressure me and the government to surrender to Hamas's will,' he added. 'The goal [of the indictment] is clear: to harm me and to harm you – the citizens of Israel who support me.'

Terror attack at Israeli embassy in Jordan, gunman killed	Attacker killed, 3 cops wounded as shooter targeted Israeli embassy in Amman. By World Israel News Staff A gunman targeting the Israeli embassy in Amman, Jordan was shot dead by security forces early Sunday morning, after he exchanged fire with police, wounding three officers. The attacker shot at the police as they engaged patrolled the Rabiah neighborhood, where the Israeli embassy is located and a frequent location for anti-Israel demonstrations. Earlier, gunshots had been heard near the embassy, causing local police to cordon off the area. It's believed that the perpetrator who fired the shots, likely aiming for the embassy, then attacked the police as they arrived to investigate. While Israel signed a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994, anti-Israel sentiment is widespread throughout the Hashemite Kingdom. Immediately following October 7th, Jordanians held numerous rallies with tens of thousands of celebrating the murderous Hamas rampage. Earlier in November, a former member of the Jordanian parliament was sentenced to 10 years in prison for smuggling weapons - presumably to terrorists for use in attacks against Israel - into Palestinian Authority-controlled territory. In October, two Jordanian terrorists wearing army uniforms infiltrated into Israel by breaching the border fence in the Dead Sea region. They opened fire in a moshav, wounding two people, before being shot dead by the community's emergency response team. In September, a Jordanian citizen killed three Israeli security guards at the Allenby Crossing, a checkpoint between Jordan and Palestinian Authority-controlled territory in Judea and Samaria. The day before the deadly attack, Jordanian Queen Rania railed against the Jewish State during a speech at a European economic conference. Accusing Israel of a 'criminal occupation' against the Palestinian people, Queen Rania claimed that the death toll in the ongoing Gaza war was indicative of Israel's inherent bias towards Palestinians. 'This devaluation of life must be called out for what it is: anti-Palestinian racism. This failure cannot stand,' she said.

EU official: Respect ICC warrants and arrest Netanyahu – or else	Borell stressed that countries which choose not to comply with the warrant could potentially face consequences. By World Israel News Staff Outgoing European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borell, a long-time critic of Israel, demanded that all EU member states act in accordance with recently-issued International Criminal Court arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'The states that signed the Rome convention are obliged to implement the decision of the court. It's not optional,' Borrell charged during a recent speech in Cyprus. Borrell appeared to be referring to statements from some European countries, including Germany, that they would not comply with the warrant and would refrain from arresting Netanyahu if he traveled to their nations. Hungarian President Victor Orban, a staunch supporter of Israel, recently invited Netanyahu to visit the country and pledged that the warrant would not be enforced on Hungary's soil. Terror group Hamas praised the decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, calling it an 'important step towards justice.' Borell stressed that countries which choose not to comply with the warrant could potentially face consequences. The EU diplomat continued to rail against the Jewish State, claiming that Israel uses claims of antisemitism to deflect legitimate criticism of its actions. 'Every time someone disagrees with the policy of one Israeli government [they are] accused of antisemitism. I have the right to criticize the decisions of the Israeli government, be it Mr. Netanyahu or someone else, without being accused of antisemitism. This is not acceptable. That's enough,' Borell said. Earlier in November, Borell urged the European Union to cut ties with Israel due to alleged human rights violations in the Gaza Strip. In March, Borell accused Israel of 'provoking famine' in the Gaza Strip, while calling the coastal enclave the world’s 'greatest open-air prison' and 'greatest open-air graveyard.'

Hamas claims female hostage killed during Gaza strike, IDF warns ...	The IDF later stated that it is 'currently assessing the information' and cannot 'confirm or deny its authenticity.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas claims that a female Israeli hostage was killed in a northern Gaza strike, the BBC reports. On Saturday, Abu Obeida Hamas's armed wing spokesman made the claim and said another female hostage was injured and in danger. He said, 'The danger still threatens the life of another female (prisoner) who was with her.' The IDF later stated that it is 'currently assessing the information' and cannot 'confirm or deny its authenticity.' 'IDF representatives are in contact with her family and providing them with any available information,' the statement continued. The IDF emphasized that Hamas employs 'psychological terror' and acts with 'cruelty.' 'The IDF urges everyone to avoid spreading rumors or publicizing comments that could cause harm to the families of the hostages,' the statement concluded. After despairing of a hostage release deal, there is some indication that Hamas may be willing to negotiate. Last week, a senior defense official reported that Hamas has given up on its demand that Israel commit to an immediate and permanent ceasefire before freeing hostages. This demand created a major impasse between Israel and Hamas during repeated hostage deal negotiations. The official indicated that Israel may be closer to reaching a hostage release agreement with Hamas than at any time in the past year. The proposal includes a 42-day pause in fighting coinciding with the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The official explained, 'There will be a price to the deal, but we are convinced that after 42 days, we'll know how to return to fighting.' Given the fact that Hamas repeatedly steals humanitarian aid, the official indicated that Israel is seeking the assistance of a private company that will be in charge of distributing the aid to Gazan civilians without Hamas's interference. He confirmed that the Palestinian Authority would not be in charge of distributing aid to Gazans at the end of the war.

House arms US Treasury with new powers to strip terror-linked cha...	The bill also includes humanitarian provisions, postponing tax filing deadlines for Americans held hostage or unlawfully detained abroad. By Jewish Breaking News The U.S. House of Representatives just handed the Treasury Department its biggest anti-terror weapon since 9/11, pushing through landmark legislation to financially strip non-profit organizations backing Hamas and other terrorist groups. The measure passed 219-184 on Thursday with strong Republican backing, creating a new category of 'terrorist supporting organizations,' defined as any entity the Treasury Secretary designates as having provided material support to a terrorist organization within the past three years. Under the bill’s framework, the Treasury must provide 'a description of such material support or resources to the extent consistent with national security and law enforcement interests.' Organizations designated as terror-supporting would have 90 days to appeal their designation. It would apply broadly across the nonprofit sector, including membership organizations, unions, and private foundations. The bill also includes humanitarian provisions, postponing tax filing deadlines for Americans held hostage or unlawfully detained abroad. 'It’s very, very simple,' said Rep. Jason Smith, the Republican chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. 'We, as members of Congress, have the duty to make sure that taxpayers are not subsidizing terrorism.' Speaking on the House floor, Smith also argued that Democrats who opposed the measure would have supported it if Vice President Kamala Harris had won the presidential election earlier this month. Supporters argue the bill provides necessary tools for protecting American taxpayers while maintaining appropriate oversight of the nonprofit sector, though various nonprofit organizations have expressed concerns about the scope of the Treasury’s newfound authority and appeal processes. 'We think this legislation is an overreach,' Jenn Holcomb, vice president of government affairs at the Council on Foundations, tells the Associated Press. 'It would allow the Secretary of the Treasury to designate a 501(c) nonprofit as a terrorist organization at their discretion. And our concern is it doesn’t have enough in there to really ensure that a nonprofit understands the reasoning that a secretary designated as such.' Political analysts also question why the bill was brought out of committee now while the Democrats still control the Senate, rather than wait until after January 20th when Republicans will hold a mandate in Congress, the White House, and the Supreme Court.

Orban invites Netanyahu to Hungary as ICC warrant divides Europea...	The Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Finland, Portugal, Slovenia, and Ireland are among the EU states that have said they would meet their ICC commitments. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday to visit Hungary but several other European nations said the Israeli premier would be detained if he set foot on their soil, following the issuing of an arrest warrant for him. The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Netanyahu, his former defense chief Yoav Gallant, and for a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu and Gallant, adamantly rejected the allegations as false, saying the ICC’s actions were politically motivated. All European Union (EU) countries are members of the court, which means they are supposed to enforce its warrants. But the diverging reactions — and the fact that EU heavyweights Germany and France have not said if they would arrest Netanyahu — highlight the major diplomatic and political challenge posed by the ICC decision, which drew swift condemnation from Israeli leaders and the White House. 'For us Europeans, this warrant exposes a real dilemma between international law, which is our law, and our foreign policy, especially for those member states that are unconditionally backing Israel,' Eurointelligence analysts wrote in a note. Assuring Netanyahu that he would face no risks if he visited Hungary, Orban branded the arrest warrants a 'brazen, cynical, and completely unacceptable decision.' Orban, who is often at odds with his EU peers, has forged warm ties with Netanyahu. 'Today I will invite Israel’s prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu, for a visit to Hungary and in that invite I will guarantee him that if he comes, the ICC ruling will have no effect in Hungary, and we will not follow its contents,' Orban said. The ICC, which does not have its own police force to carry out arrests, has only limited diplomatic means to force countries to act if they do not want to. The Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Finland, Portugal, Slovenia ,and Ireland are among EU states that have said they would meet their ICC commitments. Netanyahu will be arrested if he set foot in Ireland, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris told RTE radio. 'Yes absolutely. We support international courts and we apply their warrants,' Harris said. Cyprus, which has close ties to Israel, regards the warrants as binding in principle, a government source told Reuters. Germany Torn But Berlin declined to spell out what it would do until and unless Netanyahu planned to travel to Germany, adding that legal questions had to be clarified regarding the warrant. Germany 'is one of the biggest supporters of the ICC — this attitude is also the result of German history,' a government spokesperson said. 'At the same time, it is a consequence of German history that we share unique relations and a great responsibility with Israel,' the spokesperson added, alluding to the Nazi era. German officials said they will carefully examine the warrants and how to deal with them. 'I find it hard to imagine that we would make arrests on this basis,' government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit on Friday, pointing out that legal questions had to be clarified regarding the warrant. France was also non-committal, toning down its initial reaction, which had been to say that its response would align with ICC statutes. 'France takes note of this decision. True to its long-standing commitment to supporting international justice, it reiterates its attachment to the independent work of the Court, in accordance with the Rome Statute,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine said in a statement. Paris said on Friday the ICC decision was not a ruling but a 'formalization of an accusation.' France has been working on Lebanon ceasefire efforts and officials said cornering Netanyahu now could scupper those efforts. Non-EU Britain — also an ICC member — was similarly circumspect in its response. In the Netherlands, far-right leader Geert Wilders said he would meet his 'friend' Netanyahu in Israel soon, even though the Dutch government has said it will act on the ICC‘s arrest warrant if the Israeli leader were to visit the country. Wilders is the leader of the largest Dutch government party, but is not himself a cabinet member. The Czech Republic, which like neighboring Hungary has traditionally sided with Israel, appeared similarly conflicted. The Czech foreign ministry said Prague would respect its international legal obligations, while Prime Minister Petr Fiala described the ICC decision as 'unfortunate' and said it would undermine the court’s authority. The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, which rules Gaza, launched the ongoing war in the Middle East with its invasion of southern Israel last Oct. 7. During the onslaught, the terrorists murdered 1,200 people, wounded thousands more, and kidnapped 251 hostages while perpetrating mass sexual violence against the Israeli people. Israel responded with a military campaign aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities in neighboring Gaza.

Gaetz says he will not return to Congress after withdrawing AG bi...	Trump announced that he will instead nominate former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi (R.) for the position. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz (R.), who withdrew his nomination as President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general on Thursday, announced on Friday he will not be returning to Congress next year. 'I'm still going to be in the fight, but it's going to be from a new perch. I do not intend to join the 119th Congress,' Gaetz told podcast host Charlie Kirk in an interview. Gaetz, who was first elected to represent the Sunshine State in 2016, resigned from the House earlier this month after Trump tapped him to lead the Department of Justice. He faced pushback from Senate Republicans, however, and quickly withdrew his nomination as questions swirled around allegations that he had had sexual encounters with a minor. While the Justice Department last year closed a probe into the allegations without charging Gaetz, the House Ethics Committee was conducting its own investigation when the congressman resigned. Trump announced that he will instead nominate former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi (R.) for the position. While Gaetz, who has been one of Trump's fiercest defenders in the House, was elected this year to another term, he said he will fight for the president-elect from outside Congress. 'I'm going to be fighting for President Trump,' Gaetz said. 'I'm going to be doing whatever he asks of me, as I always have. But I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress.' It is unclear what is next for Gaetz, though some sources have speculated that he could run for governor of Florida following term-limited Republican Ron DeSantis. Gaetz added that he's 'excited' to see who fills his now-vacant seat. 'There are a number of fantastic Floridians who've stepped up to run for my seat, people who have inspired with their heroism, with their public service. And I'm actually excited to see Northwest Florida go to new heights and have great representation,' Gaetz told Kirk.

Pro-Israel stalwart Ritchie Torres hints at run for New York gove...	Torres in recent days has said that there is a 'crisis of governance' in New York State and New York City. By Andrew Bernard, JNS Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), one of Israel’s staunchest defenders in Congress, hinted at a run for higher office on Friday by taking aim at New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. The Bronx Democrat said that like U.S. President Joe Biden, Hochul could be on the path to electoral defeat. 'Kathy Hochul is the new Joe Biden,' Torres wrote. 'She may be in denial about the depth of her vulnerabilities as a Democratic nominee. A Democratic incumbent who is less popular in New York than Donald Trump is in grave danger of losing to a Republican in 2026–an outcome not seen in 30 years.' 'Waiting until it’s too late gave us a Republican President in 2024 and could give us a Republican governor in 2026,' he added. 'Let’s avoid repeating history and avoid sleepwalking toward impending disaster and defeat.' Torres in recent days has said that there is a 'crisis of governance' in New York State and New York City. 'I think part of the story of the election is an indictment of misgovernance in New York state and New York City,' Torres said in an interview on Monday with Spectrum News NY1. 'With few exceptions, nowhere was there a greater swing toward Donald Trump than in New York, which was a vote of no confidence in the leadership of New York state.' U.S. President Joe Biden carried more than 60% of the vote in New York state in 2020, but in November, Trump narrowed that lead, with Harris winning just 56% of the vote to Trump’s 44%. The largest swing of any county in New York towards Trump occurred in Torres’s Bronx county, driven by the massive shift towards Republicans among Latino voters. A poll in September showed that Hochul had just a 34% job approval rating, and in 2022 she defeated then-congressman Lee Zeldin by just 6 percentage points, the worst performance by a Democrat in a statewide race in two decades. Since taking his seat in Congress in 2021, Torres, 36, has been widely lauded by the Jewish community for his vocal efforts to combat Jew-hatred and his support for Israel in the House. 'I see my freedom as a Black Latino from the Bronx as inextricably bound to the freedom of the Jewish people,' Torres told pro-Israel rally-goers after he was awarded the Jewish Federations of North America’s Courageous Leadership Award earlier this month. Though Torres has not directly criticized New York City Mayor Eric Adams by name in the way that he has called out Hochul, Torres could also make a run for Gracie Mansion in the 2025 election as Adams fights federal bribery charges. A spokesman for Torres told JNS that 'the congressman has yet to make a final decision regarding his future' as to whether he planned to announce a run for mayor or governor.

‘This is just who we are’: Trudeau says Canada would arrest Netan...	I have to say that we’re horrified, but not shocked,' said Michael Teper, a board member of the Canadian Antisemitism Education Foundation. By Dave Gordon, JNS Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, said during a press conference on Thursday that he would have Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrested if the premier arrived on Canadian soil, in line with a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. 'First of all, as Canada has always said, it’s really important that everyone abide by international law,' Trudeau said. 'This is something we’ve been calling on from the beginning of the conflict. We are one of the founding members of the International Criminal Court and International Court of Justice.' Both the ICC and the ICJ are located in The Hague, although the justice court is a body of the United Nations and the criminal court is a stand-alone body. The ICC issued warrants on Thursday for Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, the former Israeli defense minister, among others. 'We stand up for international law, and we will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts,' Trudeau added. 'This is just who we are as Canadians.' Netanyahu has called the court’s decision a 'modern Dreyfus trial,' while U.S. President Joe Biden recycled a six-month-old statement, in which he referred to the court’s decision as 'outrageous.' Leo Housakos, a Quebec senator, wrote that Trudeau’s were 'disgraceful comments' that suggested that 'Canadian authorities would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.' 'This ill-considered endorsement of the ICC’s politically motivated actions is a slap in the face to our ally and to every innocent Israeli still being held hostage,' Housakos stated. 'We stand with the people of Israel and support their right to self-defense against terrorism. The actions taken by both the ICC and Justin Trudeau should be condemned as a dangerous precedent that threatens global stability and the principles of international law.' 'I have to say that we’re horrified, but not shocked,' Michael Teper, a board member of Canadian Antisemitism Education Foundation, told JNS of Trudeau’s comments. 'The statement is sadly highly predictable and indicative of the overall attitudes of the government of Canada these days,' Teper said. 'It’s really just sad that Mr. Trudeau is taking this approach.' Earlier in the day, Anthony Housefather, Canadian special advisor on Jewish community relations and antisemitism, wrote that 'Israel was attacked by terrorists on Oct 7. The warrant issued by the ICC today against Netanyahu and Gallant claims their crimes started as early as Oct. 8. A day Israel was in shock, grief and mourning. The ICC discredits itself by its actions today.' Amir Epstein, director of Tafsik, an Israel advocacy group with affiliates in Toronto and Winnipeg, told JNS that 'the idea that Canada is aligned with Islamofascist countries that dictate what the ICC, the ICJ and the United Nations say and do is no longer surprising to anyone.' He noted that dictators are able to 'come freely into Canada,' which 'is both laughable and embarrassing at the same time.' The Abraham Global Peace Initiative in Toronto stated that it 'expresses its strongest condemnation' of the court’s 'reckless and politically motivated' action. 'The decision underscores the ICC’s troubling trend of weaponization against Israel, prepared by the Palestinian Authority and its allies since 2015,' the group said. 'The ICC’s arrest warrants dangerously distort international justice by empowering extremists, exacerbating global antisemitism and undermining peace efforts during a time of heightened tensions.'

Trump selects Florida’s Bondi as next attorney general following ...	Matt Gaetz abruptly withdrew his name from consideration by the attorney general, citing that he did not want to contribute anything extra to the transitioning team. By Jewish Breaking News Donald Trump has nominated former Florida AG Pam Bondi as the next Attorney General of the United States after Matt Gaetz withdrew from AG consideration. The president-elect wrote of the nomination: 'I am proud to announce former Attorney General of the Great State of Florida, Pam Bondi, as our next Attorney General of the United States. Pam was a prosecutor for nearly 20 years, where she was very tough on Violent Criminals, and made the streets safe for Florida Families. Then, as Florida’s first female Attorney General, she worked to stop the trafficking of deadly drugs, and reduce the tragedy of Fentanyl Overdose Deaths, which have destroyed many families across our Country. She did such an incredible job, that I asked her to serve on our Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission during my first Term — We saved many lives! For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans – Not anymore. Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again.

Israeli defense minister orders end to administrative arrests for...	Emergency security measure used to prevent terror attacks will no longer be employed against Israeli citizens living in Judea and Samaria, Defense Minister Israel Katz rules. By World Israel News Staff Israel's defense minister has ended the practice of using an emergency provision to place Israeli Jews living in Judea and Samaria under extended arrest without trial. On Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) announced that he has instructed his ministry to halt the practice of using administrative arrest or detention against Israeli citizens living in Judea and Samaria. 'In the current climate, where Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria face significant threats of Palestinian terrorism, supported by the Iranian axis of evil seeking to establish a terror front against Israel, and where international sanctions unfairly target settlers and settlement organizations, it is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such a severe step,' Katz said Friday. 'When there are suspicions of criminal activity, those responsible can and should be prosecuted. If no criminal charges can be brought, other preventive measures must be employed that do not involve administrative detention.' 'I unequivocally condemn any acts of violence against Palestinians and taking the law into one’s own hands,' Katz continued, adding: 'It is critical to allow the IDF and other security forces to combat Palestinian terrorism and violence effectively, without individuals undermining the rule of law.' Administrative detentions were first adopted by the British Mandate, as one of the emergency regulations of 1945. The emergency measures were continued on by the State of Israel following its establishment in 1948, allowing state authorities to detain individuals for up to six months at a time without a trial, indictment, or proof of wrongdoing, as a preventative measure to confront a perceived threat to national security. Such administrative orders can be issued by the Shin Bet internal security agency, the Israel Police, or Israeli courts. In Judea and Samaria, the orders are issued under the authority of the Defense Ministry, which administers those parts of Judea and Samaria which are under Israeli control. According to Katz's office, the minister met with Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar earlier this week, advising him of the policy change and asking Bar to 'put alternative tools in place.' Administrative arrest is used frequently against Palestinian Arabs suspected of plotting terrorist attacks against Israelis, but has also been employed occasionally against Israeli Jews, including residents of Judea and Samaria.

Israel Aerospace Industries reports most profitable year in its h...	The growth was driven by IAI’s Missile and Space Systems Division, with $1.87 billion in sales for the first nine months of 2024, up from $1.63 billion in 2023. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel Aerospace Industries reported a record-breaking order backlog of approximately $25 billion and a 74% increase in net income in its third-quarter earnings report released on Thursday. 'During this time, we have achieved unprecedented milestones, not just in technological and business terms but as a testament to our commitment to excellence,' said IAI chairman Amir Peretz. Net income for the nine months ending September 30 rose sharply to $416 million, up from $239 million in the same period last year, making it the most profitable period in the state-owned company’s history. For the third quarter alone, net income increased to $122 million, a significant rise from $74 million in Q3 2023. The growth was driven by IAI’s Missile and Space Systems Division, with $1.87 billion in sales for the first nine months of 2024, up from $1.63 billion in 2023. The Arrow missile system earned global acclaim, supported by increased R&D investment of $81 million in Q3, up from $65 million. IAI also reported a record-breaking $25 billion order backlog as of September 30, 2024. This represents a $7.22 billion increase from the previous year and secures 3.5 years of operations at current sales volumes. International demand for Israel’s military technology has surged as European countries increased their defense budgets in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Israel is developing a multilayered aerial defense system that has drawn global attention. The Arrow-3 system, which is designed to intercept ballistic missiles, had its first operational success when it shot down a ballistic missile fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen in November. It is widely believed to be the first time a missile was intercepted in outer space, but Israeli officials have not confirmed this. Operating income during the nine months grew to $431 million, up from $292 million in 2023. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the nine-month period reached $646 million, a 33% increase year-over-year, while gross profit for the third quarter climbed 25% to $282 million, reflecting an 18% profit margin. The company’s sales also rose, reaching $4.39 billion for the nine-month period, a 13% increase from $3.87 billion in the previous year. Third-quarter sales alone totaled $1.54 billion, up 16% from Q3 2023. This growth was driven by increased demand across all business divisions, with particularly strong performance in the Military and Aviation groups. 'Despite a national crisis, IAI maintained supply chain continuity and expanded its global relationships. Our systems play a critical role in Israel’s defense while strengthening our international standing,' said IAI President and CEO Boaz Levy.

Houthi missile triggers alarms in Judea	In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv, in response to which Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port in a major aerial attack. By JNS A ballistic missile fired at Israel by Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists in Yemen activated air-raid sirens in the Gush Etzion region of Judea and the Dead Sea area on Thursday night, the Israel Defense Forces said. 'Following the sirens that sounded in the areas of Judea and the Dead Sea, one launch that was approaching from Yemen towards Israeli territory was intercepted by the Israeli Air Force prior to crossing into Israeli territory,' the military confirmed in a statement on social media. Alerts were activated in the Gush Etzion communities of Tekoa, Pnei Kedem, Nokdim, Ma’ale Rehav’am, Ma’aleh Amos, Metzad and Kfar Eldad, as well as in Ein Gedi and Mitzpe Shalem near the Dead Sea, sending thousands of Israeli civilians running for bomb shelters. On Nov. 11, a Houthi missile triggered sirens across the Judean Foothills and the Lachish region, including in Beit Shemesh, Adora, Tzora, Beit Guvrin, Sarigim, Karmei Tzur, Kfar Etzion and Kiryat Arba. The missile was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, according to the IDF. Yemen’s Houthi militia has launched numerous attacks on the Jewish state in support of Hamas in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv, in response to which Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port in a major aerial attack. On Sept. 29, the Israeli Air Force carried out dozens of strikes in the area of Hodeidah. Jerusalem said the targets included 'power plants and a seaport, which were used by the Houthis to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil.'

‘Outrageous’ – Biden blasts ICC arrest warrants for Israeli leade...	Biden administration 'fundamentally rejects' ICC's decision to push for arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling the move 'outrageous' and 'troubling.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden on Thursday condemned the International Criminal Court at The Hague's decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials, calling the move 'outrageous.' On Thursday, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and slain Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, writing that there were 'reasonable grounds' to believe the three had violated international law during the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel. In a statement issued by the White House Thursday evening, Biden rejected the attempt to draw equivalency between Israel and Hamas. 'The ICC issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous. Let me be clear once again: whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.' The White House National Security Council also issued a statement condemning the ICC decision, calling it 'troubling.' 'The United States fundamentally rejects the Court’s decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials,' a NSC spokesperson said Thursday. 'We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.' Republican lawmakers also castigated the ICC's decision, with congressional Republican leaders pushing for sanctions against the court. 'The ICC’s decision to target America’s ally, Israel, is antisemitic, reprehensible, and completely ridiculous,' House Speaker Mike Johnson tweeted. 'It has absolutely no jurisdiction over Israel or the United States, and these illegitimate warrants are an attack on the very concepts of sovereignty and due process.' Johnson noted that the lower chamber of Congress voted earlier this year to impose sanctions on the ICC, and urged Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to put the bill to a vote.

Trump mulling sanctions on ICC judges over Netanyahu arrest warra...	The president-elect is reportedly preparing a list of possible sanctions for the International Criminal Court, including personal measures targeting chief prosecutor Karim Khan and ICC judges, after the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The incoming Trump administration is drafting a list of possible measures to take against the International Criminal Court at The Hague in response to the court's decision Thursday to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Israel's public broadcaster Kan reported Friday. U.S. sources cited in the Kan report said the president-elect and his advisers are currently mulling possible sanctions against the International Criminal Court, including punitive actions targeting not only ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, but also the ICC judges who signed off on the arrest warrants. 'The possibility is of imposing personal sanctions not only on the prosecutor or the court - but also on the judges themselves who issued the order,' one source was quoted as saying. Trump's National Security Advisor-designate Michael Waltz, who currently represents Florida's 6th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives, castigated the ICC's decision Thursday as 'antisemitic.' 'The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,' Waltz tweeted. 'Israel has lawfully defended its people & borders from genocidal terrorists. You can expect a strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC & UN come January.' Congressional Republican leaders also condemned the ICC for issuing the arrest warrants, pledging to move forward with legislation sanctioning the court. 'The ICC’s decision to target America’s ally, Israel, is antisemitic, reprehensible, and completely ridiculous,' House Speaker Mike Johnson tweeted. 'It has absolutely no jurisdiction over Israel or the United States, and these illegitimate warrants are an attack on the very concepts of sovereignty and due process.' 'The U.S. Senate should vote immediately on the bipartisan Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act, and President Biden should take clear steps to prevent these warrants from being enforced. If Senator Schumer and President Biden do not act now, they will most assuredly invite future lawfare against Israel and the United States. We cannot afford to show weakness.'

UNRWA official met with Palestinian terror groups secretly, decla...	The former commissioner emphasized a 'spirit of partnership' and said UNRWA's decisions could be challenged or even reversed at the terror group representatives' requests. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A former UNRWA commissioner met with Palestinian terror groups secretly in Lebanon in 2017 and told them, 'No one can separate us' and 'We are one,' UN Watch reports. Former UNRWA commissioner general Pierre Krahenbuhl held a meeting in Beirut in February 2017, and attending were Chief in Lebanon Hakam Shawan, Ali Baraka from Hamas, Abu Imad Al-Rifai from the Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Salah Al-Youssef from the PFLP and representatives from other Palestinian terror groups. Hamas official Ali Baraka had close ties with terrorist entities in Syria and Iran and was listed by the US as a wanted terrorist. Abu Imad al-Rifai, a Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader, bragged about organizing suicide bombings targeting US and British military personnel. Krahenbuhl was apparently aware that the meetings were problematic because he insisted on secrecy and warned exposure could 'lead to a loss between donor countries and UNRWA, which might result in reduced or even halted funding.' The former commissioner emphasized a 'spirit of partnership' and said UNRWA's decisions could be challenged or even reversed at the terror group representatives' request. Krahenbuhl said they had the opportunity to meet with him 'a thousand times' to discuss their concerns or objections to policies and could reverse them. He said, 'Your cooperation with us in security matters and your commitment to not closing UNRWA institutions, facilities, schools, or offices also completes this partnership. If we can achieve this, it means we are united, and no one can separate us.' These documents exposed by UNWatch give insight into how UNRWA established close ties with terror groups to the extent that Hamas embedded its terror infrastructures inside UNRWA buildings and schools, with many UNRWA teachers also involved in acts of terrorism. UNRWA was met with scrutiny last year when it came to light that a number of UNRWA workers were actively involved in the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7th.

Netanyahu calls ICC arrest warrant a ‘modern Dreyfus trial’	The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Netanyahu, Gallant, and a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. By Algemeiner Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday lambasted the International Criminal Court’s decision to issue arrest warrants for him and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, calling the ruling 'antisemitic' and the charges on which it was based false. 'Israel utterly rejects the false and absurd charges of the International Criminal Court [ICC], a biased and discriminatory political body,' Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. 'No war is more just than the war Israel has been waging in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, when the Hamas terrorist organization launched a murderous assault and perpetrated the largest massacre against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.' The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Netanyahu, Gallant, and a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. The war began last Oct. 7, when the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, which rules Gaza, invaded neighboring southern Israel and perpetrated a bloody massacre that killed 1,200 people and wounded thousands more. During the onslaught, the terrorists perpetrated mass sexual violence and kidnapped over 250 hostages. Israel responded with a military campaign aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities in Gaza. However, the ICC said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for starvation in Gaza and the persecution of Palestinians — charges vehemently denied by Israel, which has provided significant humanitarian aid into the war-torn enclave throughout the war. The statement from Netanyahu’s office noted that the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, initially made his surprise demand for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on the same day in May that he suddenly canceled a long-planned visit to both Gaza and Israel to collect evidence of alleged war crimes. The last-second cancellation infuriated US and British leaders, according to Reuters, which reported that the trip would have offered Israeli leaders a first opportunity to present their position and outline any action they were taking to respond to the war crime allegations. 'The antisemitic decision of the International Criminal Court is a modern Dreyfus trial — and will end the same way,' the Israeli premier added. Albert Dreyfus was a French army officer falsely convicted of espionage in a landmark case that sparked antisemitic violence across France. Antisemitism has surged globally since Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre, amid the ensuing Gaza war, with countries around the world reporting record spikes in antisemitic attacks and other incidents targeting Jewish communities. Netanyahu vowed that 'no anti-Israel decision will prevent the State of Israel from defending its citizens.' In a rare show of unity, bitter political foes of Netanyahu from across the Israeli political spectrum joined him in condemning the ICC decision. 'Israel defends its life against terrorist organizations that attacked, murdered, and raped our citizens. These arrest warrants are a reward for terrorism,' said Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid. Benny Gantz, who joined Netanyahu’s war cabinet in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack but quit in June, lambasted what he called the ICC’s 'moral blindness,' calling the ruling a 'shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten.' Gallant, who Netanyahu fired as defense minister earlier this month, posted on social media that the ICC’s 'outrageous decision will live in infamy.' 'It places the State of Israel and the brutal terrorist organization Hamas in the same equation. Today’s decision legitimizes and rewards the murder, rape and kidnapping of Israeli children, women, and men,' Gallant continued. 'The State of Israel will not be deterred — long gone are the days when the nation of Israel could not defend itself. The IDF will continue fighting to achieve the goals of this war: Dismantling Hamas, ensuring the return of the hostages, and enabling Israel’s northern communities to return to their homes.' The former defense chief added that he was 'proud of the extraordinary privilege I had in leading Israel’s defense establishment during our hardest hour.' President Isaac Herzog similarly said the ICC 'chose the side of terrorism and evil over democracy and freedom and turned the international justice system itself into a human shield for Hamas’s crimes against humanity.' The ICC has 'lost all legitimacy' after issuing the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said. 'A dark moment for the International Criminal Court,' Saar posted on X, adding that it had issued 'absurd orders without authority.' Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said the ICC showed 'once again that it is antisemitic through and through.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich urged Netanyahu to sever contact with the court and impose sanctions on the Palestinian Authority and its leaders. 'Israel will continue to defend its citizens and its security with determination,' he said. There was no immediate comment from Gallant on the ICC decision. 'Israel is fighting … the most just of wars against pure evil. All Israelis, left and right, stand behind the war, whose goals are to release the kidnapped Israelis, demolish Hamas and restore security to Israel. Shame on ICC,' wrote former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a right-wing critic of Netanyahu. Amir Ohana, speaker of Israel’s parliament, known as the Knesset, and a top member of Netanyahu’s Likud Party, expressed similar sentiments: 'Targeting the democratically elected leaders of Israel, the Middle East’s only democracy and the world’s only Jewish state, is nothing short of an assault on justice, truth, and the universal right of self-defense.' The ICC has no jurisdiction over Israel as it is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the court. Other countries including the US have similarly not signed the ICC charter. However, the ICC has asserted jurisdiction by accepting 'Palestine' as a signatory in 2015, despite no such state being recognized under international law. Countries that are signatories, including several in Europe, are bound by the charter to enforce its rulings and arrest warrants.

‘You can expect a strong response’: Republicans, weeks away from ...	The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,' Rep. Michael Waltz (R., Fla.). By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon The International Criminal Court's decision to issue arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister sparked a flurry of promises from Republican leaders to sanction the court and erode its legitimacy on the world stage. The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this year that would do just that, though Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) blocked it from coming to a vote in the upper chamber. In a matter of weeks, however, Schumer will be in the minority—and Republicans will control both the House and the executive branch. Incoming GOP leaders in the House, Senate, and White House made clear that, come January, the ICC will face sanctions and other punitive measures. 'The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,' Rep. Michael Waltz (R., Fla.), President-elect Donald Trump's incoming national security adviser, said in reference to the court's determination that Netanyahu and former Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant are guilty of war crimes. 'Israel has lawfully defended its people & borders from genocidal terrorists. You can expect a strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC & UN come January.' House majority whip Tom Emmer (R., Minn.) echoed Waltz, telling the Washington Free Beacon that Republicans in the lower chamber 'will continue doing everything in our power to combat this pro-terrorist, illegitimate court.' 'House Republicans passed bipartisan legislation five months ago to sanction the ICC for unlawfully targeting our ally, yet it has done nothing but collect dust on Chuck Schumer's desk,' Emmer said. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) also took aim at Schumer. 'It is time for the U.S. Senate to act and sanction this irresponsible body,' he said. 'Now.' Following months of debate, the ICC determined that Israel has intentionally starved Palestinians in the war-torn Gaza Strip during its yearlong war to eradicate Hamas. The charges carry little legal weight, as the United States and Israel are not members of the court. It's unlikely that an ICC sanctions bill will land on President Joe Biden's desk before the octogenarian leaves office. Whether such a bill passes this year or in January, however, it will do so with bipartisan support. Sen. John Fetterman (Pa.), often the lone Democratic voice defending Israel from international persecution, categorically rejected the ICC's charges, indicating that the next Senate's Republican majority will have at least one ally in its fight against the court. 'No standing, relevance, or path,' Fetterman wrote on X. 'F—k that.' In addition to pushing for sanctions, Graham has led his own investigation into ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, who is accused of sexually harassing female colleagues. That investigation is also likely to ramp up come January. The ICC, in a bid to appear neutral, also issued arrest warrants for several Hamas leaders, including military chief Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, who cannot face charges because he was killed in July by an Israeli airstrike. Israeli leaders quickly condemned the ICC after the court announced the arrest warrants. Netanyahu's office said that 'no anti-Israel decision will stop Israel from defending its citizens.' The ICC's case is largely built upon allegations that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war. The court claimed the troves of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip is not enough to alleviate hunger among Palestinian civilians, though it did not mention that Hamas steals much of this aid. It also dismissed Israeli efforts to boost food deliveries in recent months. 'Decisions allowing or increasing humanitarian assistance into Gaza were often conditional,' the court wrote, adding that they were 'not sufficient to improve the population's access to essential goods.' Israel is also being prosecuted at a different court, the United Nations' International Court of Justice, over similar charges. The case was brought by South Africa thanks to underwriting from Iran, Qatar, and several Hamas-linked entities, the Free Beacon reported last week.

‘West Wing’ director to helm epic tale of American who built Isra...	The significance of Schwimmer’s contribution wasn’t lost on Israel’s founding father, David Ben-Gurion, who declared him 'America’s greatest gift to Israel.' By Jewish Breaking News Before Israel had an air force, it had Al Schwimmer – an American engineer who orchestrated one of the most daring covert operations in modern history, with help from an unlikely crew including Frank Sinatra and Meyer Lansky. Warner Bros. has tapped Aaron Sorkin to bring this extraordinary tale to the big screen. Behind the controls of military aircraft during World War II, Al Schwimmer cut his teeth as a flight engineer for TWA and the U.S. Air Transport Command. But it was his early experience as an aerospace engineer at Lockheed that would lay the groundwork for an operation that seems scripted for the silver screen. In 1948, while Jews were battling to establish their homeland, Schwimmer assembled a remarkable team of World War II veterans for a mission that would reshape Middle Eastern history. Schwimmer’s unlikely allies included notorious mobster Meyer Lansky, entertainment icon Frank Sinatra, and even Pee-wee Herman’s father, forming what might be the most eclectic covert team ever assembled. Together, they orchestrated the smuggling of 125 military aircraft and over 50,000 weapons to British-Mandated Palestine in a direct challenge to an American embargo at the time. The significance of Schwimmer’s contribution wasn’t lost on Israel’s founding father, David Ben-Gurion, who declared him 'America’s greatest gift to Israel.' His actions laid the groundwork for what would become one of the world’s most formidable air forces. Sorkin’s adaptation draws from David Kushner’s Business Insider article 'America’s Greatest Gift to Israel,' with Gotham Group’s Eric Robinson and Ellen Goldsmith-Vein producing. For Sorkin, who won an Oscar for 'The Social Network' and earned critical acclaim for 'The West Wing,' Schwimmer’s story continues his tradition of bringing pivotal historical moments to life on screen.

Hamas has given up demand to end the war before freeing hostages ...	The official indicated that Israel may be closer to reaching a hostage release deal with Hamas than at any time in the past year. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News According to a senior defense official, Hamas has given up on its demand that Israel commit to an immediate and permanent ceasefire before freeing hostages, Arutz Sheva reports. This demand created a major impasse between Israel and Hamas during repeated hostage deal negotiations. The official indicated that Israel may be closer to reaching a hostage release agreement with Hamas than at any time in the past year. The proposal includes a 42-day pause in fighting coinciding with the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The official explained, 'There will be a price to the deal, but we are convinced that after 42 days, we'll know how to return to fighting.' Given the fact that Hamas repeatedly steals humanitarian aid, the official indicated that Israel is seeking the assistance of a private company that will be in charge of distributing the aid to Gazan civilians without Hamas's interference. He confirmed that the Palestinian Authority would not be in charge of distributing aid to Gazans at the end of the war. The defense official also said that now was an opportune time to attack Iran's nuclear facilities and declared, 'Iran was never as exposed to an attack as it is now.' Regarding Hezbollah, he said the terror group may be ready to agree to a ceasefire deal, and areas of disagreement are being resolved. Earlier this month, Mossad Director David Barnea declared that it was unlikely that the hostages would be released through a deal negotiated between Israel and Hamas. Israel's Channel 12 reported that Barnea, who has headed up Israel's negotiating team in Doha, Qatar, met with relatives of Israeli captives still held in the Gaza Strip to update them on the efforts to secure the release of their loved ones. According to the report, Barnea attempted to lower expectations, telling the relatives that he believed that the chances of ever achieving an agreement with Hamas were low. 'What's going on with the deal at the moment?' the relative of a hostage asked Barnea recently. 'I still haven't gotten an official answer from the mediator, not to the Qatari proposal, nor to the Egyptian proposal, and therefore it pays to wait,' Barnea responded. 'At the moment, the chances for a small deal are low, Hamas is insisting on ending the war.'

Jessica Tisch, Jewish public servant, appointed as commissioner o...	Tisch will be the city’s fourth police commissioner since Adams took office in January 2022. By Luke Tress, JTA Jessica Tisch, a longtime New York City public servant, was appointed as the commissioner of the NYPD on Wednesday. Tisch, who comes from a prominent Jewish family, will become the second woman to head the city’s police department in its 179-year history. Tisch, 43, is a 12-year veteran of the largest police department in the U.S. — she was previously the NYPD’s deputy commissioner for information — and was appointed as the city’s sanitation commissioner in 2022. In that role, she prioritized fighting against the city’s rats, going viral for her pronouncements against the rodents. As police commissioner, a role she will assume on Monday, Tisch said she would work to keep New York 'safe and vibrant,' fight crime and disorder, build on the city’s counterterrorism abilities and implement police technology. 'We will do all of this with integrity as we continue to build public confidence and trust in the police,' Tisch said in a Wednesday statement. Tisch will be the city’s fourth police commissioner since Adams took office in January 2022. Announcing the appointment, Mayor Eric Adams said Tisch was 'one of the most successful managers in our administration.' Adams said, 'To ensure New Yorkers have the ability to thrive in our city, we need a strong, battle-tested leader who will continue to drive down crime and ensure New Yorkers are safe and feel safe, and I cannot think of a leader more up to the task than Commissioner Jessica Tisch.' Tisch’s father, James, is the president and co-C.E.O. of the Loews Corporation, which her family has led since the 1950s. Her mother, Merryl Tisch, is the former chair of the New York State Board of Regents and chairperson emeritus of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty. The family has a stake in the New York Giants and a hand in some of the city’s top Jewish nonprofits, and its name adorns one of the city’s hospitals and New York University’s arts school The couple’s foundation distributed $18 million in grants in 2023, mostly to the Jewish Communal Fund. In 2006, Tisch married Dan Levine, who works as a venture capitalist, in a ceremony at Central Synagogue in Manhattan that was officiated by her grandfather, Rabbi Philip Hiat, a Reform rabbi known for his interfaith work. Tisch joined the NYPD as a counterterrorism analyst in 2008, the mayor’s office said. She climbed the force’s ranks until she left to become the commissioner of the city’s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications from 2019 to 2022. She began her public service career after attending Harvard University as an undergraduate, as well as Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. 'My grandmother was incredibly supportive,' Tisch told The New Yorker. 'Everyone else was, like, ‘Really?’ The NYPD has about 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilian employees, and a budget of $5.8 billion. The department is seen as closely tied to Adams, who had a career in the NYPD before entering politics. The Adams administration has been in turmoil in recent months due to charges of corruption. Adams pleaded not guilty to bribery charges in September. The previous commissioner, Edward Caban, resigned in September after investigators confiscated his phone in a federal investigation into Adams’ associates. Caban’s lawyers said at the time that he was not the target of the investigation. The subsequent interim police commissioner, Tom Donlon, also became the subject of a federal probe.

‘A dark day for justice’: Israelis react to Netanyahu, Gallant ar...	Netanyahu and Gallant are now liable for arrest if they travel to countries that are party to the ICC. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel officials across the political spectrum reacted with anger and outrage after the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued unprecedented arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday. It is the first time warrants have been issued against leaders from a democratic country. The ICC ruling represents 'a dark day for justice and humanity,' said Israeli President Isaac Herzog. 'Taken in bad faith, the outrageous decision at the ICC has turned universal justice into a universal laughingstock. It makes a mockery of the sacrifice of all those who fight for justice – from the Allied victory over the Nazis till today,' he said. 'It ignores the plight of the 101 Israeli hostages held in brutal captivity by Hamas in Gaza. It ignores Hamas’ cynical use of its own people as human shields. It ignores the basic fact that Israel was barbarically attacked and has the duty and right to defend its people. It ignores the fact that Israel is a vibrant democracy, acting under international humanitarian law, and going to great lengths to provide for the humanitarian needs of the civilian population,' Herzog added. The unanimous ruling, signed by Judges Nicolas Guillou, Reine Adélaïde Sophie Alapini Gansou and Beti Hohler, said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant committed crimes against humanity in Gaza, including murder, persecution and using starvation as a tactic of warfare. A statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office called ICC judges 'antisemitic,' Prosecutor Karim Khan 'corrupt,' and insisted Israel would not be deterred from bringing its hostages home and eliminating Hamas as a threat. 'The decision to issue an arrest warrant against the Prime Minister was made by a corrupt chief prosecutor who is trying to save himself from sexual harassment accusations and biased judges who are motivated by antisemitic hatred of Israel,' the statement said. 'No anti-Israel decision will prevent the State of Israel from defending its citizens.' Current Defense Minister Israel Katz called warrants 'a moral disgrace that is entirely tinged with antisemitism and that degrades the international legal system to an unprecedented low. This is a shameful decision that serves the head of the snake, Iran, and its proxies.' Netanyahu and Gallant are now liable for arrest if they travel to countries that are party to the ICC. Israel is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction. The ICC charter prohibits the court from prosecuting nationals of countries with independent judiciaries. The legal action was spearheaded by the Palestinian Authority, which in 2014 was recognized by the court as a 'State,' leading Israeli officials to accuse the ICC of being politicized. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Deif. Although he was killed in an airstrike in July, Hamas never confirmed Deif’s death. Other national leaders with outstanding ICC warrants include Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, Libyan general Mahmoud al-Warfali and God’s Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

After Argamani knocks on the front door, the birthday girl opens it and is thrilled to see the two women surprise her By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Noa Argamani, who was abducted by Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists during their deadly rampage across southern Israel last Oct. 7, helped surprise another former hostage kidnapped during the onslaught in Israel on Monday with pastries for her 10th birthday. Argamani, 27, who was taken from the Nova music festival and rescued by IDF soldiers, and Hila Rotem Shoshani, 13, who was released in a hostage deal, together surprised Emily Hand at her home in honor of her birthday. A video from the scene that was shared on Instagram shows Argamani and Shoshani arriving at Hand’s house, carrying trays with what appear to be traditional Moroccan donuts and a birthday candle. After Argamani knocks on the front door, the birthday girl opens it and is thrilled to see the two women surprise her Emily Hand spent her 9th birthday as a hostage in Gaza. This year, on her 10th birthday, she was surprised by former hostages Noa Argamani and Hila Shoshani who came to celebrate her first birthday since being released. Here’s to many more happy birthdays, Emily pic.twitter.com/Wtn5qbZPyP — Israel ישראל (@Israel) November 20, 2024 Irish-Israeli citizen Hand was at Shoshani’s house for a sleepover when they were both taken captive by Hamas terrorists who attacked their community of Kibbutz Be’eri on Oct. 7, 2023. They were held captive for almost two months and eventually released as part of a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas on Nov. 25, 2023. Hand was one of the youngest hostages abducted by the terrorists on Oct. 7. Shoshani’s mother, Raaya, was also taken hostage by Hamas. She was released on Nov. 29 of last year as part of a temporary ceasefire deal, brokered by Qatar and the United States, between Hamas and Israel. Argamani was rescued on June 8 of this year, when Israeli soldiers raided the apartment where she was being held in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Three other hostages were also rescued during the same IDF raid.

IDF forces capture Syrian infiltrator in Golan	He reportedly did not breach the Israeli security fence in the area. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces detained a Syrian who crossed into the Jewish state’s territory in the Golan Heights on Thursday, the IDF announced. According to the Israeli military, the suspect individual 'did not stop in response to calls by soldiers, was shot in the leg and transferred to Ziv Medical Center in Safed for further treatment and investigation.' Ynet reported that the suspect crossed into the Israeli side of the Alpha Line, which marks the demilitarized zone between the two countries. He reportedly did not breach the Israeli security fence in the area. Concerns in Israel have grown in recent months over the possibility of a cross-border mass murder and kidnap attack launched by Iran-backed terrorist militias in southern Syria and targeting the Golan Heights. The military confirmed to JNS on Nov. 13 that it started work on a barrier on the Golan’s frontier with the Arab Republic 'to thwart a possible terrorist invasion and protect the security of Israel’s borders.' Earlier this month, the IDF revealed that its forces captured a pro-Iranian regime terrorist operative during a raid in Syria. The raid was carried out by members of the Egoz commando unit along with field interrogators of the Military Intelligence Directorate’s Unit 504. Ali Soleiman al-Assi, from Saida in the southern part of the country, was tasked by Iran with 'gathering intelligence on IDF troops in the border area for future terror activity of the network,' the military said.

‘Dark day for justice’ – ICC issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu...	International Criminal Court at The Hague issues warrants calling for the arrest of Israel's prime minister and its former defense minister, drawing sharp condemnation from both the Israeli government and Opposition. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff The International Criminal Court at The Hague issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, six months after ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced plans for the warrants. Marking the first time the ICC has called for the arrest of leaders of a democratic country, judges wrote that there were 'reasonable grounds to believe' that Netanyahu and Gallant had violated international law between October 8th, 2023, and May 20th, 2024, marking the period spanning the beginning of Israel's response to the October 7th invasion through the first weeks of the Rafah operation in southern Gaza. The decision immediately drew sharp condemnation from not only the Israeli government, but also from Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, a former rival of Netanyahu and critic of the Netanyahu government, as well as from Opposition leaders. 'This is a dark day for justice. A dark day for humanity,' Herzog tweeted Thursday afternoon. 'Taken in bad faith, the outrageous decision at the ICC has turned universal justice into a universal laughing stock. It makes a mockery of the sacrifice of all those who fight for justice - from the Allied victory over the Nazis till today.' 'It ignores the plight of the 101 Israeli hostages held in brutal captivity by Hamas in Gaza. It ignores Hamas’ cynical use of its own people as human shields.' 'It ignores the basic fact that Israel was barbarically attacked and has the duty and right to defend its people. It ignores the fact that Israel is a vibrant democracy, acting under international humanitarian law, and going to great lengths to provide for the humanitarian needs of the civilian population.' 'Indeed, the decision has chosen the side of terror and evil over democracy and freedom, and turned the very system of justice into a human shield for Hamas’ crimes against humanity.' 'This cynical exploitation of the international legal institutions reminds us once again of the need for true moral clarity in the face of an Iranian empire of evil that seeks to destabilize our region and the world, and destroy the very institutions of the free world.' Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called the warrants a 'mark of shame' for the ICC, saying that Israelis 'left and right, stand behind the war.' Opposition Leader Yair Lapid excoriated the ICC over the issuing of the warrants, calling them a 'reward for terrorism.' 'Israel is defending itself against terrorist organizations that attacked, murdered and raped our citizens. These arrest warrants are a reward for terrorism.' Fellow Opposition leader MK Benny Gantz condemned the ICC decision as 'moral blindness' which will 'never be forgotten.' Yair Golan, chairman of the left-wing The Democrats party also took aim at the ICC. 'This is a shameful decision of the International Court in The Hague,' Golan said. 'Israel had and will always have the right to defend itself against our enemies.' While the ICC warrants cannot be enforced so long as Netanyahu and Gallant remain in Israel, the two could face arrest if they travel to any of the 123 countries bound by the Rome Statute which established the ICC.

Massive Israeli airstrike kills 68 in Syria	Bombings hit three positions in Palmyra used by Hezbollah and other pro-Iranian groups. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A series of Israeli airstrikes in eastern Syria killed at least 68 people Wednesday a Syrian opposition group said, making it the deadliest air attack attributed to Israel in Syria in years. According to reports by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based anti-regime organization, Israeli warplanes carried out three airstrikes on positions occupied by Hezbollah terrorists and members of other pro-Iranian proxy groups Wednesday afternoon. The airstrikes targeted Hezbollah and the Nujaba militia in the city of Palmyra, in Syria's Homs district, SOHR reported, stating Thursday that the death toll from the strikes had risen to 68. All 68 reported fatalities were combatants, SOHR claimed, including 42 Syrian nationals affiliated with pro-Iranian militias, five of whom were officers working in conjunction with Hezbollah. The remaining fatalities include 4 Lebanese members of Hezbollah, and 22 other non-Syrian nationals, whom the report said were affiliated with the Nujaba Movement. Forty-three others were injured in the strikes, SOHR reported, including 7 civilians. Syria's SANA state media outlet confirmed the attacks, claiming Wednesday that 36 Syrian nationals had been killed and more than 50 others injured. 'The Zionist entity committed a horrific crime in Palmyra today, which claimed the lives of 36 citizens and injured dozens of others in the air aggression carried out by Israeli aircraft, targeting a number of residential buildings and causing material damage to the buildings and surrounding area.' Syria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in a statement to SANA Wednesday. According to Syria's defense ministry, 10 of the Syrian nationals killed in the airstrikes were soldiers in the Syrian army. The Israeli military declined to respond to reports of the airstrikes. SOHR claimed that the three airstrikes included a pair of bombings in Palmyra's Al-Jam'iya quarter, striking a weapons depot and a building used by leaders of pro-Iranian militias.

Douglas Murray, Ben Shapiro tell thousands in Jerusalem: You are ...	Several Knesset members also attended the event, including Amichai Chikli, Amihai Eliyahu, Dan Illouz, Ohad Tal, Ariel Kellner and Simcha Rothman. By David Isaac, JNS Two giants of political conservatism, Douglas Murray and Ben Shapiro, starred at Jerusalem’s International Convention Center on Tuesday night before a sold-out crowd of more than 3,000 in what might best be described as a mutual admiration society, with the crowd applauding its pro-Israel champions as they in turn voiced esteem for Israelis’ grit and fighting spirit. 'Thank you on behalf of Western civilization for fighting the fight the rest of the West should be fighting,' Shapiro told the audience at the 'Freedom of Zion' conference. He asked those with loved ones who had served in the Israel Defense Forces in the past year to stand up. Nearly all did. 'That’s unique. It’s something that doesn’t exist in the West anymore,' Shapiro said, describing it as a 'civic militarism' once common in Western societies. 'There are people here … who … put their bodies on the line defending civilization. I am merely a writer,' said Murray. 'If I give you any encouragement, you should know that the encouragement you give me is 1,000-fold.' Early reports pointed to an enormously successful event. The Jerusalem Post on Monday said that Shapiro-Murray was the hottest ticket in town, with fans 'scrambling for scalped seats,' likening it to a Taylor Swift concert. 'Trying one more time. Looking for one ticket to the Ben Shapiro/Douglas Murray event in Jerusalem Tuesday evening. Willing to pay well over face value. Please DM [direct message] me,' posted a member of Secret Jerusalem, an online community of Jerusalemites. Several Knesset members also attended the event, including Amichai Chikli, Amihai Eliyahu, Dan Illouz, Ohad Tal, Ariel Kellner and Simcha Rothman. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro speaks at the Freedom of Zion Conference at the International Convention Center in Jerusalem, Nov. 19, 2024. Photo by Yaakov Nachumi/Herut Center. Murray and Shapiro are renowned in conservative circles. Shapiro, an American Jew, is host of a daily political podcast, and founder of media company The Daily Wire. He frequently speaks on college campuses and is the author of numerous books, including, 'Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans' and 'The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great.' Murray, who is from the United Kingdom, first came to prominence with his 2017 book, 'The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam,' in which he warned that Europe could not survive mass Muslim migration and its loss of faith in its 'beliefs, traditions, and legitimacy.' An outspoken defender of Israel prior to the Hamas invasion, Murray ramped up his efforts in columns and TV appearances in its wake. While pro-Israel conservatives may have difficulty picking favorites between the two, it was clear from the audience reaction that Murray was the star of the evening, due perhaps to the fact that he is not Jewish and rushed to Gaza’s front lines at the outset of the war. 'For Israelis in general, you’ve become a symbol over the last year,' said Maj. (res.) Doron Spielman, the IDF’s English-language spokesman, during a one-on-one dialogue with Murray at the conference. Spielman noted that when he and Murray had entered the Gaza Strip a few weeks after the Oct. 7, 2023 attack, soldiers on break skipped the few hours’ sleep provided to them to stand in line to meet the journalist. 'They just wanted to get a hug from you and a picture with you to send to their family,' said Spielman. 'At what point did you decide to stand in the line of fire for the State of Israel and the Jewish people?' he asked. Murray attributed it to both intellectual and emotional reasons, suggesting a good deal of it was due to his upbringing and the values he was taught, such as distinguishing between right and wrong, admiring courage and not viewing victimhood as a virtue, an idea he said was today infecting most of the West. Murray also said he felt it was wildly unjust how Israel is treated abroad, particularly since the Hamas invasion, which cast into sharp relief how the Jewish nation is 'the only nation in the world which, when it gets attacked, then gets attacked again.' His connection to Israel has 'become personal,' he confessed. 'When I read about something terrible happening here, it affects me personally, as if it’s family.' Murray stressed that Israel must maintain its strength, noting that history shows that the most dangerous time for Jews is when they are 'prominent and weak.' He dismissed as impossible the idea that Jews could avoid prominence, keep their heads down and not stand out. There’s only 'one option,' for Israel, that is to be 'prominent and strong,' he said, to a rousing cheer from the audience.

Significant time was given over for audience questions. A line quickly formed along the entire length of the hall. Asked about the American Jewish vote, a majority of which still went to Democrats, a questioner wondered what could be done to break Jews of their left-wing leanings. Murray expressed optimism, saying that a shift away from the Democrats was already taking place. He noted that while living in Israel for most of the last year, he had had a chance to meet Diaspora Jewish delegations. T hey would say to him, particularly American Jews, that while they lent support to the MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, 'no one’s been there for me.' 'I started to realize the only thing I could say was, ‘Well, welcome,’ by which I meant, ‘Welcome to the real world.’ It was always going to be like that. This was never going to be reciprocated,' he said. Responding to a question about the existential threat posed to Israel by Iran, Murray suggested the goal should be regime change. History books will show that two journeys in the 20th century should never have been allowed to continue, he said. The first is the train from Zurich that started Vladimir Lenin’s journey back to Russia. The second is the plane that carried the first leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, back to Tehran. 'My hope is that whatever the Israeli military and political leadership can do, the endgame should be that the virus that has ruined Iran … is gone,' Murray said. Murray was presented with a Freedom of Zion Award at the event. 'We want you to know that we understand that you are fighting our war and that this is just a small token to remind you that we know that you are part of our battle,' said Spielman. Amiad Cohen, founder and CEO of the Herut Center for Israeli Liberty, the organizer of the event, presented the award to Murray. 'There’s no word in English that I found in the dictionary for ‘hakarat haTov,’ [‘acknowledging the good’] we’re in real debt for your support as a nation,' he said. The Herut Center, which promotes conservative ideas in Israeli public discourse, seeks to craft a conservative agenda for Israeli public affairs and introduce Israelis to the intellectual underpinnings of conservative thought, translating into Hebrew the books of famous conservative thinkers. Hebrew versions of Murray’s and Shapiro’s books were available at the conference. Cohen said that Murray and Shapiro were a natural fit for the Herut Center. 'The two are both strong conservatives who believe in peace through strength and total victory in the war. And it’s obvious that these two supporters of Israel should be recognized,' he told JNS. 'The war is not only a war for Israel, but it’s the war for the West, for the moral argument for the West,' he added, describing the Hamas attack as a litmus test separating those standing with Israel and 'the right side of history' from those on the side of Hamas and 'evil.' Murray and Shapiro are the 'right people at the right time' to bring this message before the Israeli people, Cohen said. 'That’s why I invited them. It’s totally part of the conservative movement worldwide, and Israel definitely, after the Trump victory.' In a 20-minute speech to the conference, Shapiro stressed the point that Israel’s fight is a fight for the West, depicting the Jewish state as a last bastion of values that were the foundation for Western success. Israel’s economic and military success and its high birth rate are a result of traditional Western values, which makes Israel’s success so vital for Western civilization’s continued success, he said. 'You are an outpost of Western civilization,' he said. 'This is the tip of the spear in a civilizational battle. It’s why everyone cares so much and it’s why you don’t have a choice as to whether to succeed. You have a duty to succeed … Because as you go, Western civilization goes,' he added. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro speaks at the Freedom of Zion Conference at the Binyanei Ha’Uma in Jerusalem, Nov. 19, 2024. Photo by Yaakov Nachumi/Herut Center. Shapiro spoke of an Israeli soldier he had recently met. Ari, 22, was badly wounded in Gaza, losing two limbs. Wheelchair-bound, Ari had thanked Shapiro for his efforts on behalf of Israel and then astonished him by asking, 'I just have a quick question. I want to know what more can I do.' 'That’s an ethos that needs to be carried forward, not just on behalf of Israel, not just on behalf of Jews who live abroad, like me, but on behalf of Americans, on behalf of the West,' said Shapiro. Shapiro lavished praise on Israel for the way it fought back after the tragedy of Oct. 7, noting that 'a country that seemed to be fraying at every corner proved more durable and stronger than the social fabric of pretty much any other nation on the planet.' He also offered constructive criticism, calling on Israel to free itself of unnecessary bureaucracy, calling it a relic of the country’s socialist past, to pave the way toward greater economic and military strength. He called for all Israelis to take an equal share in military service, a reference to the hot-button issue in Israel of haredi, or ultra-Orthodox Jews refusing to serve. Speaking of Israel’s efforts to convince the world of the rightness of its cause, Shapiro said these efforts have failed because Israel’s enemies hate it precisely for its success and for being in the right. 'The world of moral persuasion is not where Israel is going to guarantee its future. The world of independence and strength is where Israel always has and always will guarantee its future,' he said. At the conference, awards were also handed out to soldiers fresh from the front. Shortly before coming to the stage, Murray met two of them. 'You are the tip of the spear for the entire free world,' he told the reservists, who had only hours before been fighting in Lebanon.

Israel sanctions dozens of clients of Hezbollah’s banking network	AQAH, often referred to as Hezbollah’s 'bank,' is technically a charitable association. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Defense Ministry announced sanctions on dozens of clients of the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, a network of unofficial banks used by Hezbollah to both raise and launder money, on Thursday. 'We will lay our hands on all those who support terror, on every front and with every means,' said Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement, saying the move’s goal was to 'collapse the terror networks and hit those who provide them economic oxygen.' The ministry did not name the targeted entities, but said 'deposited significant amounts with the association, which directly funds the activities of the declared terror organization Hezbollah.' The ministry said money deposited with the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association (AQAH) is used to purchase weapons and pay the salaries of Hezbollah terrorists, among other things. Israeli airstrikes targeted 20 of AQAH’s 34 branches in key Hezbollah strongholds, including Beirut, Tyre, Sidon and Baalbek on Oct. 20. In comments to The Press Service of Israel after the strikes, one senior figure in the Israeli intelligence community described AQAH as 'one of the largest centers of economic power for the Iranian proxy.' She also suggested that its competition with the Lebanese banking sector contributed to the country’s economic instability, while Hezbollah benefitted from a parallel, unregulated financial system. AQAH, often referred to as Hezbollah’s 'bank,' is technically a charitable association. Established in 1982, AQAH expanded significantly to 34 branches against the backdrop of Lebanon’s economic crisis. It specializes in providing microloans to Lebanon’s Shiite community, which predominantly supports Hezbollah. These loans serve various needs, from wedding expenses to agricultural development and solar energy farms. By further financing hospitals, schools, housing and other Hezbollah social services in areas where traditional banking services are inaccessible or distrusted, AQAH bolstered Hezbollah’s ability to act as a 'state within a state.' According to Israeli officials, AQAH is believed to handle approximately $500 million in transactions each year, with a total turnover of $3.5 billion recorded before 2019. The group’s financial activities have drawn scrutiny due to suspected connections with Iran, which is a major financier of Hezbollah. In addition to providing loans, the bank allegedly serves as a means of laundering funds for terrorism-related activities. The U.S. Treasury Dept. sanctioned AQAH in 2007. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hezbollah rocket barrage hits park in northern Israel, killing on...	Lebanese terrorists fire 10 rockets at northwestern Israel, with one direct hit scored on public park in Nahariya, killing an Israeli man. By World Israel News Staff One person was killed and two more were injured in the northern Israeli city of Nahariya, after Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon launched a barrage of rockets towards the Western Galilee Thursday afternoon. At least ten rocket launches were detected at approximately 12:00 p.m. Thursday, the IDF said, with one projectile striking a public park in Nahariya. According to an army spokesperson, most of the ten rockets were either intercepted by Israel's missile defense network, or landed in open areas. A man in his 30s was hit by shrapnel from the rocket which struck Nahariya, leaving him fatally wounded, paramedics said. Emergency first responders from United Hatzalah and Magen David Adom were dispatched to the scene to treat the man, but were unable to revive him. 'Witnesses told us that the victim was struck by shrapnel that landed in a public park,' said Barak Lavi, a United Hatzalah medic who responded to the attack. 'Unfortunately, due to the severe nature of his injuries, there was nothing more we could do.' MDA first responders said the victim was declared dead at the scene. 'We arrived at an open area near a playground and found a man in his 30s lying unconscious with shrapnel wounds to his body,' MDA medic Dor Vaknin said. 'We performed medical checks, but he showed no signs of life and we were forced to pronounce him dead.' This is the fourth fatality reported in Hezbollah attacks on Nahariya in the past month. Two other victims, a 40-year-old woman and a 44-year-old woman, were lightly injured from blast-related injuries and cuts from glass fragments in Thursday's rocket attack, MDA said, while six others were treated for shock.

Israel Aerospace Industries reports most profitable year in its h...	International demand for Israel’s military technology has surged as European countries increased their defense budgets in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel Aerospace Industries reported a record-breaking order backlog of approximately $25 billion and a 74% increase in net income in its third-quarter earnings report released on Thursday. 'During this time, we have achieved unprecedented milestones, not just in technological and business terms but as a testament to our commitment to excellence,' said IAI chairman Amir Peretz. Net income for the nine months ending September 30 rose sharply to $416 million, up from $239 million in the same period last year, making it the most profitable period in the state-owned company’s history. For the third quarter alone, net income increased to $122 million, a significant rise from $74 million in Q3 2023. The growth was driven by IAI’s Missile and Space Systems Division, with $1.87 billion in sales for the first nine months of 2024, up from $1.63 billion in 2023. The Arrow missile system earned global acclaim, supported by increased R&D investment of $81 million in Q3, up from $65 million. IAI also reported a record-breaking $25 billion order backlog as of September 30, 2024. This represents a $7.22 billion increase from the previous year and secures 3.5 years of operations at current sales volumes. International demand for Israel’s military technology has surged as European countries increased their defense budgets in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Israel is developing a multilayered aerial defense system that has drawn global attention. The Arrow-3 system, which is designed to intercept ballistic missiles, had its first operational success when it shot down a ballistic missile fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen in November. It is widely believed to be the first time a missile was intercepted in outer space, but Israeli officials have not confirmed this. Operating income during the nine months grew to $431 million, up from $292 million in 2023. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the nine-month period reached $646 million, a 33% increase year-over-year, while gross profit for the third quarter climbed 25% to $282 million, reflecting an 18% profit margin. The company’s sales also rose, reaching $4.39 billion for the nine-month period, a 13% increase from $3.87 billion in the previous year. Third-quarter sales alone totaled $1.54 billion, up 16% from Q3 2023. This growth was driven by increased demand across all business divisions, with particularly strong performance in the Military and Aviation groups. 'Despite a national crisis, IAI maintained supply chain continuity and expanded its global relationships. Our systems play a critical role in Israel’s defense while strengthening our international standing,' said IAI President and CEO Boaz Levy.

Ceasefire deal is ‘in Israel’s hands’ says Hezbollah as Biden env...	Amos Hochstein arrives in Israel following truce talks in Beirut, as top Hezbollah official says the ball is now in Israel’s court. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Amos Hochstein arrived in Israel Wednesday, following extensive talks with Lebanese and Hezbollah officials in Beirut, as part of a last-ditch effort by the Biden administration to secure a truce between Israel and Hezbollah before the president leaves office on January 20th. Hochstein declared Wednesday that he had made 'additional progress' in talks with Nabih Berri, speaker of the Lebanese parliament and a leader of Amal, a Shi’ite movement with ties to Hezbollah. Berri has served as an interlocutor for Hezbollah in talks with Hochstein. 'The meeting today built on the meeting yesterday, and made additional progress,' Hochstein said. 'So I will travel from here in a couple of hours to Israel to try to bring this to a close if we can.' This week’s talks have yielded a 'real opportunity' to reach a deal, Hochstein added. According to Axios, Hochstein was slated to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday morning, after having met with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer Wednesday evening. Hezbollah secretary-general Naim Qassem, successor to Hassan Nasrallah, appeared to signal his group’s support for the American draft proposal for a ceasefire, saying Wednesday that a truce is 'in Israel’s hands.' In a televised address, Qassem said Hezbollah had presented its 'comments' on the American proposal to Hochstein via Berri, signaling its willingness to cooperate in the 'indirect negotiations' with Israel. 'These comments were presented to the US envoy and they were discussed with him in detail,' Qassem said. 'The comments we presented show that we approve this track of indirect negotiations through Speaker Berri.' Qassem rejected Israel’s demand that Israel retain the right to operate militarily in Lebanon should Hezbollah abrogate the ceasefire. The U.S. draft proposal presented to Lebanese officials and Hezbollah earlier this month focuses on three main points: the disarming of Hezbollah forces both north and south of the Litani River; the formation of an international committee headed by an American general to oversee the implementation of the ceasefire; and Israel’s right to respond military in Lebanon should Hezbollah violate the truce – but only after the committee has exhausted attempts to restore the peace.

Israeli commando killed in building collapse in Lebanon	Three soldiers have been killed in the last two days while fighting Hezbollah. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A soldier in a reserve unit of the IDF’s elite Maglan commandos was killed Wednesday when a building collapsed on him in a village in southern Lebanon. Sgt. First Class Eitan Ben Ami, 22, was walking with his comrades through the structure during an active operation, using its cover to protect themselves. Along with others in the area, the building had been damaged by earlier Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire in advance of the military maneuvers. The initial IDF investigation showed that its sudden collapse was due to the weather conditions, rather than any hidden bombs that might have been detonated by Hezbollah forces, or active fire directed at the building. There had just been a heavy rainfall on the previous night. Four soldiers were injured in the incident and were taken to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya for treatment as the unit worked for hours to extract Ben Ami’s body from the ruins. The army said it was studying the incident in order to draw operational conclusions for the future. Ben Ami was a native of Jerusalem. Another resident of the capital, Sgt. First Class (res.) Omer Moshe Gaeldor, 30, was killed the previous day in southern Lebanon. A fighter in the 5111th Reconnaissance Battalion of the Golani Brigade, he was killed by a Hezbollah drone strike while his group was securing an area about two kilometers from the Israeli border. Three soldiers were seriously injured when the explosive drone hit, and they were all airlifted to hospital. Gaeldor, 30, was a cancer survivor and was thus not called up to serve but went anyway, his brother Nitzan said. 'He recovered from cancer two years ago and didn't have to enlist,' he told Kan’s Reshet Bet. 'The mutual decision made by him and his wife, Adi, for him to volunteer and go to the reserves was some kind of comfort, because he believed in what he was doing. He didn't hesitate and enlisted himself on October 7th.' Gaeldor had spent 'more than 250 days' on duty, Nitzan added, even though 'he didn't enjoy being in the army. We're not a military family and neither was he. But the necessity to change reality for the good of all called him.' Gaeldor is survived by his parents, wife, and two young children, eight-month-old Alouma and 3-year-old Neta. Thursday morning, the army announced the name of the Golani soldier who had been killed in battle Wednesday in Lebanon alongside a civilian, Ze’ev 'Jabo' Hanoch Erlich, a 71-year-old tour guide known for his deep knowledge of Israeli history and archeology. Sgt. Gur Kehati (20) from Nir Banim was killed and two officers wounded, including the Golani Brigade's chief of staff, Col. Yoav Yarom, when two Hezbollah fighters opened fire at the group from close range. Ehrlich, who held the rank of major in the IDF reserves, had been brought to the combat unit by an officer who had not asked for permission to do so from his commanders. Kehati is the 803rd soldier to fall since the Hamas invasion 13 months ago set off the ongoing war, and the 46th since Israel invaded southern Lebanon in October to stop Hezbollah’s constant rocket and UAV attacks on the Jewish state in support of Hamas.

UN a ‘den of antisemitism’ that betrayed Israel and US, says Trum...	Rep. Elise Stefanik, tapped by Trump to represent the US at the United Nations, castigates the international body, accusing it of serving as a 'den of antisemitism.' By World Israel News Staff A Republican lawmaker nominated by former President and President-elect Donald Trump to represent the United States in the United Nations castigated the international body on Tuesday, calling the UN a 'den of antisemitism.' Rep. Elise Stefanik, 40, who currently represents New York's 21st congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives, has been tapped by Trump to replace Linda Thomas-Greenfield as American Ambassador to the UN, addressed an annual awards dinner held by the Endowment for Middle East Truth (EMET) in Washington D.C. Tuesday evening. During her speech, Stefanik, chairwoman of the Republican Conference in the House of Representatives, accused the UN of betraying both Israel and the U.S., while serving as an 'apologist' for Tehran and its terrorist proxies. 'Even before the barbaric terrorist attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7, the U.N. has continuously betrayed Israel and betrayed America, acting as an apologist for Iran and their terrorist proxies,' Stefanik said. 'You have my commitment, as I have led this fight in Congress against vile antisemitism, I will stand up for President Trump’s America-first, peace-through-strength policies and bring moral truth and crystal-clear moral clarity at the United Nations on day one.' Stefanik referenced the 101 captives still held hostage in the Gaza Strip, including seven with American citizenship, calling their return a top priority. 'There are still over 100 hostages, including seven Americans, being held by Hamas,' Stefanik continued. 'We must not stop, and we will not stop until every hostage is brought home.' Citing examples of the UN's misconduct regarding Israel and Iranian proxy forces, Stefanik noted the ties between the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and Gaza terror groups including Hamas, and the agency's continued unquestioning reliance on Hamas casualty figures in the ongoing Gaza war. Stefanik claimed that had Trump been in office last year, 'October 7th would never have happened,' and vowed to 'stand up for' Trump's 'America First, peace through strength policies and bring moral truth and crystal clear moral clarity at the United Nations on Day One.' The State of Israel, she added 'is a miracle,' calling the Jewish state 'foundational to the United States.'

Shin Bet, police thwart Ben-Gvir assassination plot	Three Palestinian men reportedly consulted with Hamas, Hezbollah regarding how to murder National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. By World Israel News Staff Three Palestinians who plotted to assassinate National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir were arrested, the Shin Bet intelligence agency and Israeli police said in a joint media statement on Thursday morning. According to the security forces, the men, all residents of Hebron, established a terror cell and planned to murder Ben-Gvir. The minister has often advocated for harsh punishments against Arab terrorists, including the death penalty. His tough stance on terror has resulted in numerous threats to his life. According to the indictment filed in a military court earlier this week, the men reportedly consulted with the Hamas and Hezbollah regarding their strategy and sought material support for the plot from the terror groups. The ringleader of the plot, named as Ismail Ibrahim Awadi, reached out to various sources in June 2024 in an attempt to procure weapons for the assassination. Awadi gathered intelligence regarding Ben-Gvir's frequent travel routes to and from his home in a Jewish enclave within Hebron. He also learned which vehicles are used by the minister and his eldest son, and how many bodyguards typically accompanied them. The cell weighed different options regarding the location of the assassination, and considered murdering Ben-Gvir when he traveled to the scene of a terror attack to speak with survivors, as he often does. 'I extend my gratitude to the Judea and Samaria District Police and the Shin Bet for their dedication in apprehending and prosecuting the terrorist cell that planned to assassinate me and my son Shuvael,' Ben-Gvir said in a media statement after news of the arrests were made public. 'Thanks to their relentless efforts and, by the grace of God, another attempt by the enemy to harm me and my family has been thwarted,' he added. 'I remain committed to toughening prison conditions for terrorists, strengthening Israeli sovereignty and governance, distributing weapons for self-defense, demolishing illegal structures, and achieving a decisive victory over our enemies. No terrorist will deter me.'

Civilian scholar killed during unauthorized Lebanon visit with ID...	Ze'ev 'Jabo' Erlich, 71, was a prominent researcher of Israeli geography and legendary Judea and Samaria tour guide. By World Israel News Staff A 71-year-old Israeli civilian was killed by Hezbollah gunfire in southern Lebanon on Wednesday, after he entered the combat zone alongside an IDF unit, without official authorization from the army to do so. Ze'ev 'Jabo' Hanoch Erlich, a prominent researcher and scholar of Israeli geography, accompanied a Golani Brigade unit to an ancient archaeological site near Tyre. Hebrew-language media reported that Erlich did not receive the necessary permission from the army to enter southern Lebanon as a civilian. Despite not being an active-duty soldier, Erlich was apparently provided a gun, helmet, and military uniform. According to Channel 12 News, Erlich was shot dead by Hezbollah terrorists at the Shrine of the Prophet Shimon in the village of Shama. A Golani Brigade soldier, whose name has not been made public, was also killed in the incident. Golani Brigade Chief of Staff Brig. Gen. Yoav Yarom, ,a close friend of Erlich, was reported to have been seriously wounded. Preliminary findings from an ongoing military investigation indicated that Erlich likely visited Lebanon on several prior occasions in recent weeks, alongside IDF troops. Although Erlich entered Lebanon without the proper authorization and not as a soldier, the army made the unusual decision to posthumously recognize him as a fallen soldier. That makes Erlich, at 71, the oldest soldier to be killed in battle since the October 7th war began, and possibly the oldest in Israeli history. In order for a civilian to embed with IDF troops and tour southern Lebanon, IDF senior officials, such as regional commanders, must grant specific permission for their entry. That permission is typically reserved for members of the Knesset, foreign dignitaries, and journalists. Erlich, who was one of the founders of the Jewish community of Ofra in Samaria, is survived by his wife and six children. 'It’s hard to fathom the immense tragedy of losing our dear friend Ze’ev ‘Jabo’ Erlich. Jabo was one of the founding figures in the field of tour guiding and the study of Judea and Samaria. Our generation followed his lead, hanging on his every word,' Yaron Rosenthal, head of the Gush Etzion Regional Council and a friend of Erlich, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'For years, he guided and researched with unparalleled curiosity, exploring every nook and cranny and investigating every archaeological site. Few people had such a profound passion for the land and loved it as deeply as he did. To me, Jabo was also a dear friend and a mentor from whom I learned so much over the years. I will miss him deeply. We will do our best to follow in the footsteps of the giant he was.'

Bill to ban weapons exports to Israel defeated in Senate	Nearly one-third of Democratic Senators voted to ban arms exports to Israel. By World Israel News Staff A bill proposing a ban on the export of U.S. weapons to Israel was soundly defeated in a 79-18 vote in the Senate on Wednesday, with one senator voting present. The measure, proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), aimed to ban the sale of tank munitions, mortar munitions and JDAM systems to Israel. Although the bill was defeated, almost one-third of Democratic senators voted in favor of it. 18 Democrats voted in favor of banning a $774 million sale of tank rounds, 19 Democrats agreed to block the $61 million sale of mortar rounds, and 17 Democrats attempted to ban the $262 million sale of joint direct attack munitions (JDAMs). 'It goes without saying that Israel had a right to defend itself from the horrific Hamas terrorist attack of October 7, but Israel did not have the right to kill 43,000 Palestinians and injure over 100,000, most of whom are women, children and the elderly,' Sanders said when speaking about the bill in the Senate. Notably, Sanders uncritically repeated statistics provided by the Hamas terror group regarding the numbers of casualties, which do not distinguish between the deaths of terrorists engaged in combat and civilians. Those numbers are also proven to be wildly exaggerated, with the United Nations quietly revising their casualty count by half. Continuing to rail against Israel, Sanders falsely claimed that Israel is starving 'thousands and thousands of children' in Gaza. Sanders failed to mention that Hamas regularly steals humanitarian aid, stockpiling it in warehouses and then selling it at exorbitant prices to Gazan civilians. Those who have attempted to distribute aid to civilians have regularly been murdered by the terror group. Although he is a harsh critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer staunchly opposed Sanders' bill. 'Voting to block assistance today could very well embolden Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran, and endanger Israel's security on into the future,' Schumer said. 'This is about Israel's long term security and honoring a cornerstone of United States policy that we will give Israel, a democracy and a steadfast ally, the resources it needs to protect itself in a difficult world,' he added.

Convicted terrorists threaten to continue war against Israel insi...	A convicted Hamas terrorist said, 'You will end the war outside; we will start it in prison.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel Prison Services (IPS) Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi told the Knesset National Security Committee that convicted Hamas terrorists are threatening to start a war inside prison even if Israel should agree to a ceasefire. Referring to Israel's prisons as 'the eighth front' of the war, Yaakobi told the committee that an imprisoned Hamas official said, 'You will end the war outside; we will start it in prison.' He also said Fatah terrorists threatened, 'We will have our Independence Day inside the prison.' Yaakobi told the committee, 'These quotes reverberate with me, and I am preparing myself with the means and preparing the team accordingly.' In an interview with Maariv, Yaakobi emphasized the need for IPS to have tight security and advanced intelligence. He said, 'The prison service must have strong intelligence,' Yaakobi stated. 'We possess the potential to greatly enhance both security and crime prevention, directly impacting public safety beyond prison walls.' In addition to concern over potential violence by inmates, Yaakobi said IPS should focus on preventing terrorists infiltration among prison staff. 'Prominent crime organizations try to infiltrate our ranks,' he said. 'That's why polygraph tests are essential.' He added that some prison employees were caught trying to smuggle contraband into the jails. Yaakobi urged government officials and IPS employees to consider the prison system as an additional front in the war. He explained, 'This is a current and operational front. We refer to it as the 'eighth front,' alongside Lebanon, Iran, and Iraq. We are adjusting our leadership and enhancing our offensive capabilities to address it.' Yaakobi described how IPS is coordinating with security agencies to deal with terrorist threats within the prisons. He remarked, 'We are confiscating hundreds of weapons and thwarting numerous plots.' Intelligence provided by IPS and Shin Bet has uncovered multiple schemes targeting staff members. 'These threats are still very serious,' Yaakobi cautioned, emphasizing the need for sufficient funding to strengthen intelligence operations.

‘Zionists are not welcome here’: Anti-Israel Harvard students pro...	Harvard Hillel executive director Jason B. Rubenstein said there were five times as many participants at the event than protesters. By Jessica Costescu, The Washington Free Beacon Anti-Israel students protested outside Harvard University's Hillel on Monday evening, shouting, 'Zionists are not welcome here,' as students walked into the Jewish community center. The anti-Israel student group, Harvard Jews for Palestine, organized the protest against former Israel Defense Forces spokesman Ronen Manelis, who was speaking inside the Hillel. About a dozen agitators accused Israel of being a 'terrorist state' and held banners with messages such as 'Hillel Hosts War Criminals.' SHOCKING. PLEASE SHARE: Tonight, Harvard students yelled 'Zionists are not welcomed here' outside the Harvard Hillel as Jewish students were entering. It’s simply shocking how normalized antisemitism and intimidation has become on college campuses. DEFUND HARVARD NOW! pic.twitter.com/nDaSPMOFtV &mdash; Shabbos Kestenbaum (@ShabbosK) November 19, 2024 'Israel is solely responsible for the genocide it is committing. It always has been. There is no justification,' Harvard Jews for Palestine wrote Monday on Instagram. 'War crimes aren't 'Jewish life.' IOF off our campus out of Lebanon and out of Gaza.' 'IOF,' or 'Israel Occupying Force,' is an anti-Israel slur for the IDF. Inside Hillel, Manelis was discussing how Iran's aggression toward Israel is reshaping the Middle East and the multi-front challenges the Jewish state faces in the evolving conflict. He told the Washington Free Beacon he condemned 'the baseless accusations made by the protesters' and vowed to 'continue to share Israel's voice around the world.' 'It's surprising that at a place like Harvard, known for free speech and open debate, there's such ignorance and unwillingness to engage in real conversation,' Manelis said. 'Especially after the October 7th massacre, I believe students should be open to hearing different opinions instead of chanting empty slogans.' Harvard Hillel executive director Jason B. Rubenstein said there were five times as many participants at the event than protesters. He added that the Harvard University Police Department worked closely with Hillel to ensure that the event proceeded and that participants were not harassed. 'Zionism, the pursuit of Jewish self-determination in the land of Israel, is a central element of the religious identity of thousands of Jewish Harvard affiliates,' Rubenstein told the Free Beacon. ''Zionists are not welcome here,' a call for discrimination against much of our community due to our sincerely held beliefs, is bigotry.' Violet Barron, an anti-Israel student organizer and Harvard Crimson editorial editor who has accused Israel of apartheid, told the student paper that she saw the 'Zionists are not welcome here' chant as 'kind of equivalent with 'Racists are not welcome here.'' 'Zionism is, first and foremost, a political ideology, and a genocidal one at that,' she added. Harvard did not respond to a request for comment.

US vetoes UN security council resolution on Gaza ceasefire, says ...	As we stated many times before, we just can’t support an unconditional ceasefire that does not call for the immediate release of hostages,' a senior US official said. By The Algemeiner and Reuters The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution for a ceasefire in Israel’s war in Gaza, accusing council members of cynically rejecting attempts at reaching a compromise. The 15-member council voted on a resolution put forward by its 10 non-permanent members in a meeting that called for an 'immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire' and separately demand the release of hostages. Only the US voted against, using its veto as a permanent council member to block the resolution. A senior US official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of the vote, said the US would only support a resolution that explicitly calls for the immediate release of hostages as part of a ceasefire. 'As we stated many times before, we just can’t support an unconditional ceasefire that does not call for the immediate release of hostages,' the official said. Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists began the ongoing war with their invasion of southern Israel last Oct. 7. During the onslaught, the terrorists killed 1,200 people, wounded thousands, and kidnapped over 250 hostages, taking them to Hamas-ruled Gaza. Israel responded with a military campaign aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities in the neighboring Palestinian enclave. Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, Britain put forward new language that the US would have supported as a compromise, but that was rejected, the US official said. Some of the council’s 10 elected members (E10) were more interested in bringing about a US veto than compromising on the resolution, the official said, accusing Russia and China of encouraging those members. 'China kept demanding ‘stronger language’ and Russia appeared to be pulling strings with various [elected] 10 members,' the official said. 'This really does undercut the narrative that this was an organic reflection of the E10 and there’s some sense that some E10 members regret that those responsible for the drafting allowed the process to be manipulated for what we consider to be cynical purposes.'

By Pesach Benson, TPS Five Palestinian terrorists were killed as Israeli security forces destroyed four explosives laboratories in Jenin, the Israel Defense Forces disclosed on Wednesday as a crackdown on terror groups entered its second day. The army said it also confiscated weapons parts and five lathes used for producing weapons. A camera warehouse used by terror groups and dozens of explosives were also destroyed. Seven terror suspects were arrested. Meanwhile in Hebron, Israeli security forces arrested four wanted Palestinians, confiscated weapons and questioned dozens of other suspects. This comes ahead of this weekend’s Jewish celebrations at the Tomb of the Patriarchs. The Torah portion read on Saturday recounts Abraham’s purchase of the Cave of Machpeilah where he buried Sarah. The other Patriarchs and their wives are also buried in the tomb. The annual celebration draws thousands of Jews. Since the October 7 attacks, Israeli security forces have arrested more than 5,300 wanted Palestinians in Judea and Samaria, of whom around 40% are associated with Hamas. כוחות צה'ל, מג״ב ושב״כ פועלים מזה שתי יממות במבצע בג׳נין כחלק מרצף המבצעים לסיכול טרור בצפון השומרון. הכוחות חיסלו עד כה חמישה מחבלים, והחרימו שבעה כלי נשק. כמו כן הושמדו ארבע מעבדות מטענים, חמ'ל מצלמות ועשרות מטענים>> pic.twitter.com/3aFYbMW2UB &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 20, 2024 The post Israeli forces destroy bomb-making labs in Jenin as terror crackdown enters second day appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/israeli-forces-destroy-bomb-making-labs-in-jenin-as-terror-crackdown-enters-second-day/	2024-11-20T09:34:16-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/idf-jenin-bomb-lab.jpg
Israeli strikes in Iraq could be ‘imminent,’ US reportedly warns	Israel has already warned the Iraqi government that unless it reins in the militias, it faces Israeli strikes on its territory. By JNS The United States has informed Baghdad that Israeli strikes in Iraq are 'imminent' if the Iraqi government fails to stop Iranian-backed militias from attacking the Jewish state, Arab media reported on Wednesday. The U.S. told Iraq it has exhausted 'all means of pressure' on Jerusalem and has urged Baghdad to take swift action to prevent these attacks, the reports by Al-Hadath and other Saudi-owned news outlets claimed. On Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar called on the United Nations Security Council to take 'immediate action' against the Iranian-backed militias in Iraq launching drones and missiles at the Jewish state. In a letter sent to the Security Council president for November, British Ambassador Barbara Woodward, Sa’ar expressed 'grave concern over the significant increase in the frequency and the intensity of attacks on Israel conducted by the Iranian-backed militias' since September. He warned that the ongoing attacks 'have the potential to further drag the region in a very dangerous escalation while posing a significant threat to international peace and security,' noting that Jerusalem’s right to self-defense against threats from Iraq is enshrined in the U.N. Charter. Israel has already warned the Iraqi government that unless it reins in the militias, it faces Israeli strikes on its territory, the Saudi website Elaph reported earlier this month. Unnamed officials told the news outlet that satellites were monitoring the movement of ballistic missiles and related equipment from Iran to Iraq, which could be used in an attack on Israel. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani dismissed Sa’ar’s letter as a 'pretext and argument to attack Iraq' and to 'expand the war in the region,' speaking in a statement on Tuesday. His office claimed that Baghdad has refused to enter into the regional conflict with the Jewish state while 'seeking to provide relief to the Palestinian and Lebanese people.' The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an Iranian-backed amalgamation of terrorist groups, on Wednesday claimed responsibility for an attempted drone attack on a 'military target' in Israel’s north on Tuesday night. The IDF confirmed that it shot down a drone that was fired at the Jewish state 'from the east,' a phrase the army uses to refer to Iraq. The drone was shot down before entering Israeli airspace, the Air Force said. On Oct. 3, two Israeli soldiers were killed when an explosive-laden drone launched from Iraq hit an IDF base in the Golan Heights.

‘Israel, we’ve got your back,’ vows new Senate Majority Leader	Reinforcements are on the way,' declares incoming Senate Majority Leader, vowing to push back against Democratic efforts to impose arms embargo on Israel and to combat ICC's 'unlawful' attempt to arrest Prime Minister Netanyahu. By World Israel News Staff The next leader of the Republican Senate caucus, who is expected to be voted in as Senate Majority Leader in January, vowed that under his leadership, the upper chamber of Congress will 'have Israel's back.' South Dakota Senator John Thune, who recently won an internal leadership race for control of the Republican Senate caucus, held a press conference Tuesday, castigating the incumbent Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, and other Senate Democrats over failure to take action against the International Criminal Court's attempts to have senior Israeli officials arrested. 'That is outrageous, and it is unlawful. The ICC rogue actions are a threat to our ally Israel and, left unchecked, could pose a threat to America in the future.' Thune also ripped Senate Democrats pushing measures, set to be voted upon Wednesday, which would bar the sale of billions of dollars worth of military equipment to Israel, including the latest variant of the F-15 fighter jet, tank shells, and guided missiles. 'The refusal to have our ally’s back and the hesitation to call out antisemitism in our own country has consequences,' Thune said. 'It enables bad behavior and bad actors around the world and encourages others to abandon Israel in their time of need.' Republicans picked up four seats in the upper chamber in the November elections, giving them a 53-47 majority in the incoming Congress. Once the new Congress is seated on January 3rd and Thune elected Majority Leader, he said, the Republican-controlled Senate would make Israel a 'top priority in the next Congress.' 'So to our allies in Israel, and to the Jewish people around the world, my message to you is this: Reinforcements are on the way.'

10 years in prison for Jordanian MP terror smuggler	Former Jordanian MP found guilty of attempting to smuggle hundreds of weapons to terrorists in PA territory. By World Israel News Staff A former Jordanian member of parliament who was caught smuggling weapons into Palestinian Authority-controlled territory - presumably for use in terror attacks against Israelis - was sentenced to 10 years in prison by a Jordanian court on Wednesday. Imad al-Adwan, 36, was arrested at the Allenby Crossing by Israeli security forces in April 2023. At the time, Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency said that al-Adwan had been caught transporting 12 automatic weapons and 194 pistols in his car. During a Shin Bet investigaton, al-Adwan reportedly admitted to have carried out smuggling trips from Jordan to PA-controlled territory at least 12 times in a two month span. Along with weapons, he admitted he had illegally smuggled birds, electronic cigarettes and gold. After two weeks being detained in Israel, Jerusalem released al-Adwan to Jordanian custody in May 2023. Shortly thereafter, he was charged with numerous weapons trafficking offenses. A court found al-Adwan guilty on Wednesday, sentencing him to 10 years in prison and hard labor. One of al-Adwan's co-defendants in the case was found not guilty of all charges. A third defendant, who is believed to have fled Jordan, was found guilty in absentia and sentenced to 15 years in prison. A prominent critic of Jordan's peace treaty with Israel, al-Adwan was a member of the parliament's Palestine Committee and frequently railed against the Jewish State. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir was critical of the decision to release al-Adwan to the Jordanian authorities. Returning the 'terrorist who attempted to bring hundreds of weapons into Israel, to be used in attacks and crimes in the heart of the country' back to Jordan was 'a strategic and moral mistake,' Ben-Gvir said at the time in a statement. 'This diplomat should have spent years in prison in Israel and not been released,' he added.

Trump to tap Howard Lutnick for Commerce Secretary	If confirmed by the Senate, he would oversee the agency focused on U.S. economic growth and promoting domestic industries. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon President-elect Donald Trump is expected to tap Wall Street financier Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department, the Wall Street Journal reported. Lutnick, chair and CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, is currently serving as co-chair of the Trump transition team. The Jewish Republican publicly endorsed the president-elect's proposed tariffs on U.S. imports, which he would have a key role in implementing as commerce secretary. If confirmed by the Senate, he would oversee the agency focused on U.S. economic growth and promoting domestic industries. Trump considered Lutnick to lead the Treasury Department, but investor Scott Bessent has since emerged as a leading contender, according to the Journal. Lutnick, a major donor to Zionist causes, said he joined Trump’s campaign primarily because of the former president’s support for Israel and his response to Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks. 'He had clear, moral clarity when it came to Israel and what happened, and the way that he thought about what happened,' Lutnick told the Philadelphia Inquirer last month. 'That was huge to me.'

White House worried as Senate Democrats push arms embargo against...	Bernie Sanders joins progressive Democrats in pushing bill, set to go up for a vote Wednesday, that would block sales of major weapons systems to Israel, including fighter jets, missiles, tank ammunition, and more. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration is pushing back against a set of bills set to be brought before the Democratic-controlled Senate Wednesday which would, if passed, impose a sweeping arms embargo against Israel, according to a report Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, four progressive members of the Democratic Senate caucus held a press conference in the Capitol, in support of legislation preventing the sale of key weapons systems to Israel. Vermont's Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, was joined by Maryland's Chris Van Hollen, Oregon's Jeff Merkley, and Vermont's Peter Welch at the press conference, addressing a set of Joint Resolutions of Disapproval sponsored by senators Sanders, Welch, Merkley, and Hawaii's Brian Schatz. The package of bills, set to be voted on Wednesday, would prevent the transfer of at least 6 weapons systems to Israel, forcing the cancellation of over $20 billion worth of contracts. The impacted contracts include deals for the sale of advanced versions of the F-15 fighter jet, tank shells, guided missiles, mortars, and ground vehicles. In his address Tuesday, Sanders castigated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, decrying it as being 'extremist,' and accusing Israel of going beyond a measured response to the October 7th, 2023 invasion. 'Israel clearly had a right to respond to the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7th,' said Sanders. 'But Prime Minister Netanyahu’s extremist government has not simply waged war against Hamas. It has waged all-out war against the Palestinian people.' Existing legislation regarding the sale of military equipment to foreign militaries are 'very clear,' Sanders continued. 'The United States cannot provide weaponry to countries that violate internationally-recognized human rights, or block U.S. humanitarian aid. According to the United Nations, much of the international community and every humanitarian organization on the ground in Gaza, Israel is clearly in violation of these laws.' Two U.S. officials told The Times of Israel that the Biden administration is actively working to block passage of the legislation, lobbying Democratic senators to vote against the measures. While the measures are widely expected to fail in the narrowly divided Senate, where Democrats hold just a two-seat advantage, the White House fears that Wednesday's vote could mark a turning point within the party regarding support for Israel, and is hoping after this month's electoral defeat to bolster moderate elements within the party. Last week, the Biden administration declined to impose new restrictions on the transfer of weapons to Israel, after a 30-day deadline passed regarding administration demands on Israel to ensure increased aid flow into Gaza and to limit the use of mass evacuation orders in the Gaza Strip.

Reservist KIA in Gaza is 800th IDF war casualty	A senior officer in the battalion was seriously wounded in the same incident, which occurred in the Beit Lahiya area. By JNS Sgt. First Class (res.) Roi Sasson was killed in action in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces announced on Wednesday. Sasson, 21, was from the Jerusalem suburb of Mevaseret and served with the 90th 'Nahshon' Battalion of the Kfir Brigade. He is Israel’s 800th military fatality since the start of the war on Oct. 7, 2023, and the 379th soldier killed in Gaza since the start of the ground operation there on Oct. 27, 2023. A senior officer in the battalion was seriously wounded in the same incident, which occurred in the Beit Lahiya area. In addition to the military casualties, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Israel planning military government in Gaza, as activists push fo...	Facts on the ground are being created without an official government decision on the matter, according to Ynet. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Some officials in the IDF’s Southern Command are pushing for a military government to be in charge of the Gaza Strip after Israel defeats Hamas, and are working with those political forces in favor of the move, Ynet reported Wednesday. Implementation of such a plan also includes the seizure of more territory in the Strip. The IDF has already established a no-go zone on the entire Gazan border with Israel, and greatly expanded its Netzarim Corridor that divides northern and southern Gaza. It has also somewhat widened the Philadelphi Corridor on the Gazan side of the border with Egypt, which will better prevent arms smuggling to Hamas so it cannot revive itself militarily. The report said that the IDF is also establishing military outposts in the coastal enclave, with the aim of all this being to enable 'the de facto imposition of military rule.' Citing sources familiar with the details, the news site said that in recent days, lively discussions have been taking place on the subject between various parties, including new Defense Minister Yisrael Katz, senior defense officials, and other senior ministers. The report also noted that that the government is supposedly 'working step by step' towards this goal without an official decision being made on who would rule in Gaza on 'the day after.' It is no secret that the national-religious parties in the coalition, Otzma Yehudit and the Religious Zionist Party, are in favor of Israel retaining control of Gaza after the war, seeing it as the only way to ensure Israel’s security in the long term. The current push is the result of two occurrences, one local and one abroad, the report said. The first was the dismissal two weeks ago of Yoav Gallant as defense minister, as he was a fierce opponent of Israel becoming responsible for all civilian life in Gaza, which is a position still held by most if not all of the senior echelon of the IDF. The second was Donald Trump’s victory in this month’s presidential elections. Trump has announced a 'dream team' of Americans who favor right-wing Israeli policies as his point men for issues in the Middle East, including the incoming Secretary of State Marco Rubio and ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee. The report said elements in the settlement movement are saying that 'this is a historic period of time for changing the reality on the ground vis-à-vis the Palestinians, and an opportunity that will not come again,' so that now is the time, even before Trump’s inauguration, to make concrete plans to rebuild Jewish communities at least in northern Gaza. In their view, such plans and the taking of territory would then become the basis for the activities of the new administration, the report said. Part of the reason that there are voices in the military in favor of seizing land in Gaza is that they feel it is necessary to exact a price from Hamas, and that this might be the only one that would prove to its followers and would-be followers that it has suffered a huge defeat, no matter how much it would try to twist the narrative that it had won the war somehow after it is over.

Hezbollah rockets hit UN bases in Lebanon	The peacekeeping force refrains from blaming Hezbollah, instead saying that 'non-state actors' were 'probably' behind the attacks. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Several Hezbollah rockets hit United Nations bases in Lebanon Tuesday during barrages aimed at Israel. At 9:50 AM, Arab-language IDF spokesman Avichai Adraee said, a failed launch among many fired at the Galilee hit a United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) post in the Ramiyeh region in southern Lebanon. The rocket had been fired from the area of Deir Aames, several kilometers north of the post, the IDF said after a careful review. UNIFIL reported that Post UNP-5-42 east of the village of Ramiyeh had been hit. Four Ghanaian solders had been lightly injured and the post had been damaged. Three of the troops were taken to hospital for treatment. UNIFIL was careful not to blame Hezbollah by name for the attack, announcing simply that the projectile was 'probably launched by non-state actors in Lebanon.' The force added that when one of its patrols passed a village called Khirbet Silim, also on Tuesday, an 'armed man' opened fire directly at the soldiers, again without providing an affiliation for the perpetrator. No soldier were injured in the incident. Hezbollah itself had no problem claiming responsibility for the rocket strike, but instead of admitting its projectile had fallen short, the terrorist group claimed that it had attacked a gathering of Israeli soldiers in the UNIFIL base, and were surprised to find out that they were instead Ghanaian troops. Another attack on the peacekeepers was recorded in the afternoon, Adraee said. 'Close to 1:30 PM, the UNIFIL post in the Shama area in southern Lebanon was hit as a result of a number of rockets launched by the terrorist organization Hezbollah from the al-Malkiyya area in southern Lebanon,' he said. According to the Italian defense ministry, its UNIFIL headquarters was struck by eight rockets. While UNIFIL said the attack damaged a maintenance workshop but injured no one, the Italian statement said that five troops were 'being monitored' in the base’s medical facility. Defense Minister Guido Crosetto had originally accused Israel of attacking the base, calling it 'intolerable,' but later the ministry walked back the charge. A source in the ministry told AFP that Crosetto 'did not have the right information' when he spoke, and that 'Hezbollah was responsible for the attack.' This was not the first time that Crosetto was quick to pull the trigger at Israel. Last week, he had also blamed Israel when an unexploded artillery shell landed in a UNIFIL base, with no damage or injuries caused. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani had joined the accusation, telling his Israeli counterpart, Gideon Sa’ar, that UNIFIL’s soldiers’ safety had to be ensured and that such attacks were 'unacceptable.' Sa’ar promised a 'immediate' investigation, and the IDF soon revealed that the shell had emanated from Hezbollah.

2/3 of Hezbollah’s arsenal originated in Russia – report	Israeli forces operating in Lebanon have reportedly revealed that the vast majority of Hezbollah's weapons are Russian-made, including some recently manufactured. By World Israel News Staff The vast majority of Hezbollah's weapons originated from Russia, according to a report Tuesday, with recent discoveries by Israeli soldiers operating in southern Lebanon forcing the IDF to raise its estimates regarding the flow of weapons to the Iranian-backed terror group. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal published a report citing multiple sources claiming that IDF forces operating in southern Lebanon since October 1st have uncovered large quantities of Russian-made weapons in Hezbollah's possession. While Israel has long been aware of the Iranian-backed terror group's use of Russian-made weapons, the recent discoveries reportedly came as a surprise to military intelligence, which had estimated that Hezbollah's arsenal was less dependent on Russia, and that the Russian-made equipment was largely older items, many dating to the Soviet era. In fact, however, Hezbollah's arsenal includes Russian weapons manufactured as recently as 2020, Syrian security officials and an Arab official told the Journal. Rather than being made up of antiquated weapons dating back before the collapse of the Berlin Wall, Israeli forces operating in Lebanon have found troves of modern advanced Russian weapons in Hezbollah caches, including antitank Kornet missiles. The discoveries have fueled fears among Israeli leaders that Russia is strengthening its ties to the Lebanese terror group, contradicting Moscow's claims of neutrality in conflicts between Israel and Iranian proxy groups. Israel's former Ambassador to Russia, Arkady Mil-Man, said that Israel 'needs to be more assertive and defend its interests' in talks with Russia. 'We must explain and convey to the Russians that we will no longer stand any assistance to Hezbollah and Iran that could hurt Israelis.' Moscow, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, and the Syrian foreign ministry all declined to respond to the report. According to an IDF major cited by the report, between 60% and 70% of the Hezbollah weapons seized early in Israel's invasion of southern Lebanon were of Russian origin.

$5 million and repatriation: Netanyahu’s rewards for hostage info	Netanyahu promises to 'bring back all of the hostages,' dangles cash reward for information leading to rescue. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged that those providing information leading to the rescue of the hostages would be rewarded with $5 million and safe passage out of the Gaza Strip, during a tour of the coastal enclave on Tuesday. Appealing to Gazans, Netanyahu said 'whoever brings us a hostage, will find a safe way out for himself and his family.' Netanyahu also stressed that Israel 'will also give a reward of $5 million for each hostage.' 'The choice is yours, but the result will be the same. We will bring them all back,' he added. Notably, from Netanyahu's statement, it appears that the offer stands regardless of whether the hostage is living or dead. The premier also vowed that terrorists who had murdered or assaulted captives would be caught and punished by Israel. 'Whoever dares to harm our hostages — their blood is on your head,' Netanyahu warned. 'We will pursue you, and we will find you.' Defense Minister Israel Katz accompanied Netanyahu on the tour of the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the Strip along a north-south line. Katz told soldiers stationed at the Corridor 'their most important mission' is to rescue the hostages who have been held in the Strp for more than 13 months. 'We also have to ensure that Hamas won’t rule here the day after' the conflict ends, Katz said. In October, an Israeli entrepreneur pledged to personally pay a $100,000 reward in cash or Bitcoin to Gazans who provide information leading to the recovery of living Israeli hostages still held in the Strip. Nearly a month after the offer was made by Daniel Birnbaum, the former CEO of SodaStream, it appears that no Gazans have taken him up on the offer. While some of the hostages were originally held by Gazan families in their homes, it is likely that all remaining hostages are in subterranean tunnels to thwart rescue attempts.

Anti-gov’t flare suspect: Reserve officer who encouraged refusals	Reserve officer who held rank of Rear Admiral in the Navy arrested for firing explosive projectile at Netanyahu's house during demonstration. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli court lifted a gag order on the names of the suspects arrested on Sunday for firing flares at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea, revealing their names publicly for the first time. They were named as Itai Yafeh, Amir Sadeh, and Ofer Doron. Yafeh and Sadeh are longtime leaders in the protest movement against the current government and Netanyahu. Doron held the rank of Rear Admiral in the Israeli Navy reserves, and was officially suspended from the reserves in August 2023. The former senior officer, who was responsible for a naval operational center, announced that he would no longer report to reserve duty due to the judicial reform legislation. In a public statement, Doron said he would refuse to serve 'a dictatorship,' and encouraged his fellow reservists to follow suit. The declaration caused the head of the Israeli Navy, Vice Adm. David Sa’ar Salama, to suspend Doron from the reserves. Shortly before the October 7th terror onslaught, tensions within Israeli society over the planned changes to the judicial system had reached an all-time high. Hebrew-language media widely reported that many reservists were refusing to show up for duty due to their opposition to the legislation, but it's unclear exactly how widespread the phenonmenon actually was. No data including the numbers of reservists who failed to report for training were released by the military. One Air Force official said at a conference that reserve pilots who shirked training as an act of political protest ha dnegatively impacted operational readinesss on October 7th. He was swiftly condemned by senior leadership and forced to retract his comments. Hamas officials have cited the chaotic anti-judicial overhaul protests, which saw demonstrators illegally block highways, the airprot, and major intesrections across the country, factored into the timing of when to launch the October 7th attack.

Despite Biden’s objections, Netanyahu said Israel ‘followed its o...	Netanyahu said Biden 'suggested that we not go in on the ground&#8230;he also said he would stop important arms shipments.' By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told lawmakers at the Knesset in Jerusalem on Monday that outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden’s advice on how to handle the wars with Iran and its terrorist proxies across the region was often incorrect, and that Jerusalem had opted to 'follow our own view.' Following Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border massacre from the Gaza Strip, Washington 'suggested that we not go in on the ground,' he said during a 40-signature debate, which opposition lawmakers can call once a month and in which the premier is legally obliged to participate. 'It said, ‘It can be handled from the air.’ It sent experts. We decided to follow our view and go in—a ground offensive,' claimed Netanyahu. The Biden administration had also opposed going into Gaza City and its Hamas-controlled Shifa Hospital, as well as into the terrorist strongholds of Khan Younis and Rafah in the southern Strip, according to the premier. Regarding Rafah, Biden said that if Jerusalem went in, it would stand alone, said Netanyahu. 'He also said he would stop important arms shipments. And so he did. A few days later, [U.S. Secretary of State Antony] Blinken appeared and repeated the same things. I told him in a broad forum: ‘Tony, if we have to, we’ll fight with our fingernails.'' In a separate closed-door meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee meeting on Monday, Netanyahu told legislators that the United States had estimated that 20,000 Palestinians would be killed in Rafah. 'That turned out to be a total fiction,' the premier said, per Channel 14. In September, the Israel Defense Forces told reporters during a visit to southern Gaza that an estimated 2,308 terrorist operatives were killed in Rafah, while more than 13 kilometers (8 miles) of Hamas tunnels were destroyed. Netanyahu stressed in his public Knesset address on Monday that the United States did come to Jerusalem’s assistance at the start of the war, when Biden and other officials paid wartime visits to the Jewish state. However, he continued, 'We must preserve Israel’s independence. We decided to enter—and we occupied Rafah, the Philadelphi Corridor and the Rafah Crossing.' 'We eliminated the organized [Hamas] battalions,' Netanyahu said. 'We destroyed a substantial part of Hamas’s military capabilities. We aren’t done yet, but we have come a long way. But we also have a goal of destroying Hamas’s governmental capacities. This is the next thing,' he continued. 'I requested that the IDF come up with an orderly plan to eradicate the governmental capacities, which is also related to restricting their ability to distribute food, to distribute humanitarian aid,' the premier said. Netanyahu also criticized the U.S. administration over its demands that the IDF refrain from retaliating against Iran for its unprecedented ballistic missile attacks on the Jewish state. 'Again, we were told by our friends, ‘there is no need to respond,’ ‘take the win,’ ‘be content with victory.’ I said, ‘This is not a victory.’ If they attack you, and, with God’s help, they didn’t kill anyone, if you don’t respond—that’s certainly not a victory. There must be a response. We responded. I won’t go into all the details, but we responded,' he said. Biden announced in July that he was dropping out of the Nov. 5 election, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for the White House. Earlier this month, Republican President-elect Donald Trump won a decisive victory, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226.

Jerusalem court orders Palestinian Authority to pay family of int...	According to March 2024 legislation, any entity rewarding terrorists in a 'pay-for-slay' program would pay $2.7 million for each person killed and $1.35 million for each person injured. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a historic decision, a Jerusalem court ordered the Palestinian Authority to pay 46 million shekel ($12.3 million) to families of victims of the Sbarro bombing during the intifada. The plaintiffs in the case are siblings of those killed in the 2001 terrorist bombing that took place in central Jerusalem and claimed the lives of 16 people. Among the casualties from the Sbarro's terror attack were five members of the Schijveschuurder family: Mordechai, 43; Tzira, 41; Ra'aya, 14; Yitzhak, 4; and Hemda, 2, including two adults and three children. Judge Arnon Darel has ruled on compensating the plaintiffs for the death of their three siblings; the damages for the death of their parents are still pending and are likely to be significant, given the psychological suffering and loss involved. Israel's Supreme Court had in the past identified the Palestinian Authority as responsible for terror attacks, and this ruling was updated in March 2024 with legislation that any entity rewarding terrorists in a 'pay-for-slay' program would pay $2.7 million for each person killed and $1.35 million for each person injured. Until this decision, no rulings were based on this legislation, and the Palestinian Authority does not acknowledge it as legitimate. The ruling is the first time a judge is implementing the law to allow terror victims' families to receive the compensation they are entitled to according to the legislation. In addition to the above-stated amounts, Judge Darel ordered the PA to pay additional damages, including pain and suffering, shortened life expectancy, and lost wages, which amounted to an additional $5.4 million, plus attorney fees. The plaintiffs' attorney, Dr. Asaf Posner, has requested that the money be paid to his clients from funds intended for the Palestinian Authority that Israel has frozen. Dr. Posner commented that the case was a significant first step, and he expressed hope that there would be additional victories awarding damages to terror victims' families.

Israel to back lifting US sanctions on Syria, Russia – report	Israel reportedly proposes deal under which Jerusalem would back lifting of US sanctions on Syria, in exchange for cutting off weapons supply to Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Israel has offered to help Syria secure the lifting of American sanctions on the Assad regime as part of a larger deal to distance Damascus from Iran and curb the flow of weapons to the Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, according to a report Tuesday. The Lebanon-based daily Al Jounhouria reported Tuesday that Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer recently proposed such a quid pro quo arrangement during a recent visit to Moscow. Under the alleged proposal, Israel would commit to working to secure the removal of some key American sanctions on the Assad regime in Syria, in exchange for the Assad government's agreement to actively work to prevent the transfer of weapons through Syrian territory to Hezbollah. Currently, a significant portion of Iranian weapons transfers to Hezbollah take place via several routes from Syria, including through the Qalamoun Mountains, through the Damascus-Beirut highway via the Bekaa Valley, as well as on ships and aircraft departing Syrian ports and airfields. The proposed deal would also ensure Russia's involvement in blocking the transfer of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah. Tuesday's report claimed that Dermer has vowed to lobby the Biden administration to suspend some sanctions against the Syrian government, as well as a number of Syrian and Russian companies. This is not the first time Israel has reportedly agreed to back the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria in exchange for assistance in blocking weapons transfers to Hezbollah. A similar proposal was made during the first Trump administration, fueling speculation that Trump's victory in the November 5th vote may be behind Israel's renewed interest in attempting such an arrangement.

7 injured in Hezbollah rocket attacks as US envoy arrives in Beir...	Amos Hochstein makes final push for ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah, as the Iran-backed terror group pounds northern Israel with rocket barrages. By World Israel News Staff At least seven people were injured in Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel on Tuesday morning, as the Iranian-backed terror group launched over two dozen rockets at Israeli towns. 'Following the sirens that sounded between 09:50 and 09:51 in the Upper Galilee, Western Galilee, and Central Galilee areas, approximately 25 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israel,' the IDF said. At least five of the rockets were launched towards central Israel, with ten more targeting the Upper Galilee, and the remaining ten launched towards the Central Galilee and Western Galilee. Most of the rockets were either intercepted or landed in open areas, the army said. One rocket which landed near a home in the northern town of Karmiel caused serious damage and injured five people. The victims, who include a 70-year-old woman, were wounded by glass shards following the rocket's explosion. All five victims are listed in light condition. Two others were lightly injured in a rocket attack on the coastal city of Netanya. Emergency rescue teams from United Hatzalah and Magen David Adom (MDA) were dispatched to the scene to treat the victims and evacuate them to local hospitals. Later Tuesday morning, warning sirens were sounded in the Galilee after multiple drone aircraft were spotted entering Israeli airspace from Lebanon. IDF forces shot down both of the drone aircraft, an army spokesperson said. The attacks come as Biden administration envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut Tuesday morning for talks with Lebanese officials, as part of a final bid by the Biden White House to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Hochstein is reportedly hoping to secure final backing by Lebanon on a framework, before traveling to Israel to present the updated demands of the Lebanese government and Hezbollah. On Monday, it was reported that the Lebanese government had largely accepted the American proposal, though Beirut had responded with a list of requested changes and 'clarifications' for some provisions of the draft agreement, in particular those relating to Israel's right to respond military in Lebanon to violations of the ceasefire.

Hamas hijacks over 100 aid trucks over the weekend	A whopping 113 trucks were looted of their humanitarian supplies in the Gaza Strip in two takeovers. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hamas operatives stole tons of humanitarian aid being brought into the Gaza Strip over the weekend, looting almost 100 trucks on Saturday and another 15 on Sunday. United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the Saturday raid was the worst case of looting in Gaza 'in terms of volume' since the Israel-Hamas war began 13 months ago. Louise Wateridge, the Senior Emergency Officer of the UN’s aid agency exclusive to Palestinians, UNRWA, said that Israel had told the joint UNRWA-World Food Program convoy to enter southern Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing 'at short notice and via an unfamiliar route,' Reuters reported. Drivers of 98 trucks out of the 109 in the convoy were soon forced at gunpoint to take down their cargo, Wateridge said, adding that some of them were injured in the process. Dujarric added that the hijackers had caused 'severe damage to the trucks' while stealing the supplies Eyewitnesses said that the convoy had been stopped by masked men throwing grenades. Neither Wateridge nor Dujarric would identify the perpetrators as Hamas personnel when commenting on the incident, although Israel has provided proof that Hamas has warehouses so full of stolen aid that they don’t know where to put it all. In a press conference Monday, UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini actually turned the blame away from Hamas. 'Until four or five months ago, we still had local capacity, people who were escorting the convoy,' he said. 'This has completely gone, which means we are in an environment where local gangs, local families, are struggling among each other to take control of any business or any activities taking place in the south. It has become an impossible environment to operate in.' In a post on X, the international organization also accused Israel of bearing ultimate responsibility, stating that the Jewish state is continuing to 'disregard their legal obligations under international law to ensure the population's basic needs are met and to facilitate the safe delivery of aid.' In Sunday’s incident, about 15 trucks were looted in the Gaza Strip by armed men. The IDF fired at others who tried to loot more trucks and thwarted their attempt, a Ynet report stated Monday. The report also said that government officials have instructed the security establishment to intensify operations against looters. The IDF knows which points and intersections are most popular for the hijackings, the report said, and is increasing its forces at those critical points in order to ensure that the aid will reaches its destination intact. Hamas, meanwhile, claimed that it had 'executed' 20 thieves who were allegedly members of a crime ring as 'part of an integrated plan to combat the crime of robbing aid trucks.' Many in Israel think the IDF should take over the entire aid distribution process so as to weaken Hamas’ hold on the Gazan population that is currently dependent on the terrorist group for its basic needs. This would also cut off a huge money-maker for the terrorists, as Hamas has made hundreds of millions of dollars selling the aid they steal.

Russia deploying army forces on Israeli border	Russian military reportedly taking up positions along Israel's northern border along the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Russia's military has deployed ground forces along the Israeli border, Syria has claimed, establishing a number of 'observation points' opposite the Israeli frontier. On Monday, Syrian state media outlet SANA reported that the Russian army is expanding its presence in southwestern Syria, and that Russian forces are establishing nine observation points on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, adjacent to the Israeli border in the Quneitra area, and along the Jordanian frontier outside Daraa. Deputy Commander of the Russian forces operating in Syria, General Alexander Rodionov, said in a press statement that the new deployment was part of the Russian army's existing mission in Syria. 'The forces, in coordination with the Syrian Arab Army, established nine observation points along the disengagement force zone, whose mission is to carry out surveillance operations by air and land,' Rodionov said. 'Everything that is reported in some media outlets other than that is false,' Rodionov continued, denying claims that Russian forces had been withdrawn from Syria and that the deployments along the Israeli frontier were part of a new mission in Syria. Rodionov noted that Russian forces have been deployed to Syria since 2015, and arrived at the request of the Bashar Assad regime. Russian forces were dispatched to Syria, beginning in September 2015, to bolster the Assad government during the Syrian civil war, with the declared aim of combating Islamist groups, including the Islamic State in Syria (ISIS) organization. A Syrian army officer whose identity was not disclosed told SANA that Russia's deployment near the Israeli border 'increases stability and security,' and 'helps residents return to their land and lead their normal lives in their villages after being liberated from terrorism.'

Israeli security chief secretly visits Turkey in bid to reboot ho...	Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar reportedly visited Turkey, meeting with his Turkish counterpart in an effort to pressure Hamas to return to the negotiating table. By World Israel News Staff The head of Israel's internal security agency made a clandestine trip to Turkey over the weekend, Israeli media outlets reported Tuesday, in an effort to reboot hostage and ceasefire deal talks with Hamas. According to reports by Walla and Yedioth Aharanoth on Tuesday morning, Ronen Bar, director of the Shin Bet agency, flew to Turkey over the weekend to meet with Ibrahim Kalin, head of Turkish intelligence agency Millî İstihbarat Teşkilatı (MIT). The meeting came after Hamas' senior leaders were forced to relocate from Doha, Qatar, where they had been hosted for a decade, to Turkey. An Israeli official speaking on condition of anonymity was cited by Yedioth Aharanoth as saying that Bar's trip to Turkey was part of a larger Israeli effort to encourage foreign powers to exert pressure on Hamas to return to the negotiating table and to compromise on its long-standing demands. Israel is not seeking, the official added, to bring in Ankara to replace Doha as primary mediator in the hostage deal talks. Instead, Egypt, which has hitherto served in a lesser capacity to facilitate talks, is expected to become the primary interlocuter. At least one Turkish diplomat downplayed claims that Turkey has become the permanent host of Hamas' leadership, saying the presence of senior Hamas members in the country was temporary. 'Members of Hamas' political branch visit Turkey from time to time. Claims that Hamas moved its offices to Turkey do not reflect reality,' the official said, according to Yedioth Aharanoth. Turkish-Israeli relations have grown increasingly hostile since Hamas' October 7th, 2023 invasion of Israel, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's hostile rhetoric towards Israel and its war against Hamas. Over the weekend, Azerbaijani media outlets reported that Turkey had refused to grant safe passage to Israeli President Isaac Herzog's plane en route to the COP29 climate change conference in Baku.

‘A boom, and everything went black’ – Hezbollah missile victim	It was a miracle I survived,' Eran Lanksy said. 'The store was completely destroyed.' By World Israel News Staff A man who was seriously wounded by a Hezbollah ballistic missile strike in central Israel on Monday evening is speaking out about the explosion that nearly killed him. Eran Lanksy, the proprietor of a men's clothing store in Ramat Gan, a Tel Aviv suburb, told Hebrew-language outlet Walla his family had been in the shop helping him just minutes before the impact. 'My family left and five minutes later a siren sounded,' Lansky recounted. 'There were two smaller explosions, than a third one. It looked as if everything in the shop was flying around in front of me, and I was thrown about ten meters. There was a crazy boom and everything went black.' Doctors said that Lansky suffered a brain hemorrhage, along with some internal bleeding in his shoulder area. 'It was a miracle I survived,' Lanksy said. 'The store was completely destroyed.' Five other people were wounded in the blast and are hospitalized in moderate condition. Notably, the IDF spokesman, the police, and local officials have released contradictory statements about the source of the explosion. The IDF and Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shama-HaCohen claimed that the blast and subsequent fires were caused by shrapnel from the Iron Dome's in-air interception of the missile. 'A preliminary investigation found that the interceptor missile struck hit a surface-to-surface missile launched from Lebanon at a high altitude, and broke it into several pieces. As a result of the interception, part of the missile hit the ground and caused damage and casualties. The incident is being investigated,' the IDF said. However, the Central District Commander of the Israeli police said he believed that the missile had directly impacted in central Israel. Footage from the scene circulating on social media showed widespread damage to nearby office buildings and apartments, with buses and cars set ablaze.

Hamas publicly executes alleged humanitarian aid thieves	Hamas brags about 'field executions' of men accused of stealing aid; terror group regularly seizes and stockpiles aid, preventing basic goods from reaching Gazan civilians. By World Israel News Staff Members of the Hamas terror group executed 20 Gazan civilians who they claimed were stealing humanitarian aid, claiming that the brutal murders were part of a 'security operation' targeting the theft of sought-after goods. Hamas regularly seizes and hoards humanitarian aid provided by Israel and the international community, stockpiling the goods in warehouses guarded by armed terrorists and charging Gazan civilians exorbitant prices for basic necessities. Video from the incident circulating on social media showed Hamas firing an RPG at a vehicle carrying several men, who they claimed had commandeered an aid truck. Some 20 people, whom Hamas claimed were members of an organized crime ring that stole from trucks carrying goods, were killed. In a media statement, Hamas acknowledged that it had killed the alleged thieves without arresting them or putting them on trial. 'The field executions of thieves are part of an integrated plan to combat the crime of robbing aid trucks,' Hamas said in a press release. 'We will continue to pursue lawbreakers and thieves who steal the food of our Palestinian people.' It's unclear if the slayings will result in lower prices for Gazans seeking to purchase basic goods. In April 2024, a Palestinian Authority-controlled news station reported that Hamas murdered workers who were providing humanitarian aid to Gazan civilians. 'Hamas’ persecution of any party who is a source for distributing the [humanitarian] aid or securing it began from the start of the war, as Hamas persecuted well-known figures and teams of volunteers on the ground in mid-October [2023],' a Fatah TV journalist said during a broadcast. Hamas 'attacked them and killed some of them…to ensure Hamas control over the aid and its storage, which of course leads to these crazy and unreal prices that no one can pay in the shadow of this destruction.'

Iraq ‘terrified’ by potential Israeli attack on local Iranian pro...	The idea that Iraqi territory could be used for a major attack Israel 'caused a lot of noise and resentment in Iraq,' says researcher. By World Israel News Staff Iraqi officials are 'highly concerned' about Israel potentially striking the country, after reports indicated that Jerusalem would no longer tolerate ongoing explosive drone launches from Iraqi territory. Since October 7th, Shia militias in Iraq, funded by Iran, have fired hundreds of drones at Israel, with some striking the Golan Heights and Jordan Valley regions, along with the southern port city of Eilat. Several of those impacts have killed Israeli soldiers stationed near the northern Lebanon border. While Israel has so far refrained from launching retaliatory strikes on Iraq, a recent report indicating that Iran may use its Iraqi proxies as part of a widespread attack against Israel has raised fears in the country. 'Everyone is terribly afraid of an Israeli response will come against Iraq,' Dr. Ronen Zeidel, an expert on modern Iraq and researchers at Tel Aviv Univeristy, told Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv. When international media reports suggested that Iran was gearing up to launch ballistic and cruise missiles stored on Iraqi territory, pressure for local militias to step back from the conflict increased. The idea that Iraqi territory could be used for a major attack Israel 'caused a lot of noise and resentment in Iraq, along with strong pressure' on the proxy groups not to cooperate with Iran, Zeidel said. Iraqi officials told the Iranians that they should 'not even think' about leveraging Iraqi territory for the attack on Israel, the professor said. 'The Iraqis were very stressed about this matter. They told the Iranians, 'Listen, do whatever you want from Iranian territory.' It seems that the possibility of Iranian military activity from Iraqi territory has been dropped from the agenda for now.' According to Zeidel, American pressure has also been effective at reining n the Iraqi militias. Washington reportedly told the groups that should they participate in a large-scale Iranian attack against Israel, the U.S. would be unable to stop a severe response from Israel.

Netanyahu says openly that Israel struck a ‘specific component’ i...	The Israeli attack on Iran in late October destroyed an active top secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin. By Reuters and Algemeiner Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel‘s air attack on Iran last month hit an element of Tehran’s nuclear program while degrading its defense and missile production capabilities. 'It’s not a secret,' Netanyahu said in a speech in parliament. 'There is a specific component in their nuclear program that was hit in this attack.' He did not identify the component, but added that Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon had not been blocked. Netanyahu’s comments came three days after the Axios news website reported that the Israeli attack on Iran in late October destroyed an active top secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin, citing three US officials, one current Israeli official, and one former Israeli official. On Oct. 26, Israeli fighter jets carried out three waves of attacks on Iranian military targets, a few weeks after Iran had fired a barrage of about 200 ballistic missiles against Israel. This followed a previous exchange of direct attacks in April. Netanyahu, in his speech, offered a few more details on what Israel had targeted. Israel‘s April strike, he said, was narrower, taking out one of four Russian-supplied S-300 surface-to-air missile defense batteries around Tehran, the Iranian capital. He said that in October, Israel destroyed the remaining three batteries and caused serious damage to Iran’s ballistic missile production capabilities and its ability to produce solid fuel, which is used in long-range ballistic missiles.

Hezbollah missiles injure 5 people in central Israel	Central Israel is on fire because of Hezbollah’s indiscriminate rocket fire,' the Israel Defense Forces stated. By JNS Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorists fired a missile from Lebanon toward Israel’s densely populated central region on Monday night, wounding five people—one of them seriously injured. 'Central Israel is on fire because of Hezbollah’s indiscriminate rocket fire,' the Israel Defense Forces stated. A 54-year-old woman was listed as being in serious condition. The four others sustained moderate and light wounds, stated Magen David Adom, an emergency response group. First responders reportedly evacuated all five victims to Rabin Medical Center’s Beilinson Hospital in Petach Tikvah. 'Following the alerts that were activated a short time ago in the center of the country, the Air Force intercepted one launch,' which crossed into Israel from Lebanon, the IDF stated. 'A fall was detected, apparently originating from interception fragments.' Missile alerts were activated throughout the larger Tel Aviv metropolitan area and the country’s coastal plain, sending millions running for shelter, according to the army’s Home Front Command. Israel Hayom reported that a projectile fell and caused a fire outside the Azrieli Ayalon Mall in Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv. 'Police forces are working to isolate the impact scenes and evacuate the wounded. We ask the public to stay away from impact sites and obey instructions of police officers,' the Israel Police stated. The municipality of Bnei Brak, which borders Ramat Gan, stated that Ben Gurion Street had been closed to traffic due to glass fragments on the road. It called on the public to avoid the area. Take-offs and landings were briefly suspended at Tel Aviv’s Ben-Gurion International Airport amid the Hezbollah attack, per local media. 'Israel is under attack by Iran-backed terrorist groups hellbent on murdering Israelis and destroying the Jewish state,' AIPAC stated. 'America must stand with Israel and ensure our ally has the weapons it needs to fight and win this war.' 'Hezbollah missile attack makes direct hit in Ramat Gan right near our office where we were holding a post-U.S. election victory party. The party like the election was a big success,' wrote Marc Zell, vice president of Republicans Overseas and chair of Republicans Overseas Israel. ' At the same time as the missile attack on Tel Aviv, the Israeli Air Force stated that it shot down a Hezbollah suicide drone launched at the Haifa area. Earlier on Monday evening, an Israeli civilian was killed and 10 were lightly wounded when a Hezbollah rocket hit a three-story building in the northern Arab city of Shfar’am.

Exit polls show Harris made big mistake passing over Pennsylvania...	Shapiro, a practicing Jew and a popular governor known for his charismatic speaking style, had established himself as a fierce defender of Israel and Jewish interests. By Jewish Breaking News Kamala Harris’s decision to pass over Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro for her vice presidential slot proved to be a critical miscalculation, with exit polling data revealing the choice significantly dampened her support among Jewish voters. According to a survey conducted by the Honan Strategy Group for the Teach Coalition, Harris could have secured a commanding 53% to 38% margin among Pennsylvania’s Jewish voters had she selected Shapiro instead of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Instead, the Harris-Walz ticket managed only a modest 48% to 41% advantage of the Jewish vote. Shapiro, a practicing Jew and popular governor known for his charismatic speaking style, had established himself as a fierce defender of Israel and Jewish interests. He notably condemned anti-Israel campus protesters, comparing such demonstrations to 'people dressed up in KKK outfits or KKK regalia' in a CNN interview. Following Hamas’s October 7 attack, Shapiro took decisive action, delivering speeches at local synagogues, issuing strong condemnations of the terrorist group, and ordering flags to fly at half-mast at the state capitol. Then-Republican nominee Donald Trump seized on the controversy, suggesting Harris blocked Shapiro from the ticket because of his Jewish faith, arguing she feared losing Muslim voters in swing states like Michigan amid heightened focus on the Gaza war. While Shapiro himself defended Harris against accusations of antisemitism, the campaign never fully recovered from perceptions that she was soft on antisemitism and an unreliable ally of Israel. Though some political observers attributed Harris’s decision to concerns about Shapiro’s ambition and the possibility of being overshadowed by her running mate, numbers don’t lie and perhaps Pennsylvania would have swung her way had she stuck with the right choice rather than conceding to Hamas sympathizers.

Argentina seizes trove of Nazi memorabilia as part of internation...	They seized over 60 firearms from a home, including 43 rifles with Nazi eagle markings, pistols, bayonets and machine guns, and arrested a man. By Juan Melamed, JTA Police in Argentina have seized a trove of Nazi weapons and memorabilia, including dozens of guns, uniforms and busts of Hitler, in their latest discovery of Nazi relics in a country that gave refuge to Nazi leaders. The federal police’s anti-mafia division uncovered the items during a raid Friday in Quilmes, a city near Buenos Aires. They seized over 60 firearms from a home, including 43 rifles with Nazi eagle markings, pistols, bayonets and machine guns, and arrested a man. The name of the detained was not disclosed and an investigation is ongoing. According to the Ministry of Security, the investigation was made together with the police of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as part of an investigation into international weapons trafficking. Argentina’s national security minister, Patricia Bullrich, said the country had seized 'weapons and parts from a dark and tragic era of humanity.' Argentina has had an anti-discrimination law on the books since 1988 that criminalizes trafficking in such objects. Professionals from the Holocaust Museum of Buenos Aires participated in the raid and confirmed that the objects violated the law, according to local reports. Argentina was a refuge for Nazis after World War II. Adolf Eichmann was captured in the northern area of Buenos Aires in 1960. Nazi war criminals Joseph Mengele and Erich Priebke also made their way to Argentina. In October 2018 Argentina’s Jewish political umbrella organization revealed excerpts from tens of thousands of documents about World War II that shed light on the Nazi influence on the country and the Nazi war criminals who hid here. Meanwhile, Nazi relics — and items forged by their admirers — have continued to circulate. In June 2016, a collector from Argentina paid $680,000 for Nazi underpants and other memorabilia. T he following year, investigators announced the seizure of 75 items, including those seemingly used in medical experiments; most were later revealed to be forgeries. Last year, police raided and closed a publisher that was distributing Nazi literature.

Hezbollah rocket hits Israeli Arab city, killing woman	Earlier on Monday, a 65-year-old woman was lightly wounded by shrapnel from a Hezbollah rocket attack on Israel’s Galilee, and a 34-year-old man was lightly injured in another barrage less than two hours later. By JNS One Israeli was killed on Monday and five others were wounded when a Hezbollah terrorist rocket fired from Lebanon scored a direct hit on a building in the northern Arab city of Shfar’am, medical officials said. The Magen David Adom medical emergency response group initially reported that one woman was seriously wounded after being trapped, while five others sustained light wounds in the attack on the structure. The Israel Fire and Rescue Authority said multiple rescue teams were deployed to the three-story building to search for additional victims. According to the Israel Defense Forces, five projectiles were launched as part of the barrage. 'Interception attempts were made. Impacts have been detected,' the military announced in a post on social media. 6 פצועים בשתי זירות נפילה בשפרעם, בהם פצועה באורח אנוש@CBeyar pic.twitter.com/myiO0rMB0X &mdash; כאן חדשות (@kann_news) November 18, 2024 Earlier on Monday, a 65-year-old woman was lightly wounded by shrapnel from a Hezbollah rocket attack on Israel’s Galilee. A 34-year-old man was lightly injured in another barrage less than two hours later. According to Magen David Adom, the woman was treated on the scene before being evacuated to Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya along with another person suffering from anxiety. The injured man was also transported to the same hospital, according to MDA, which said he suffered from 'blast injuries.' Hezbollah launched 30 rockets at the Upper and Western Galilee areas in the attack that injured the woman, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Some of the projectiles were intercepted, while the rest fell in open areas, the military said. בהמשך להתרעות שהופעלו לפני זמן קצר במרחבים הגליל העליון והגליל המערבי, זוהו כ-30 שיגורים שחצו משטח לבנון, חלקם יורטו והיתר נפלו בשטחים פתוחים &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 18, 2024 Sirens continued to sound in northern Israel in the late morning and early afternoon hours, including in Arab al-Aramshe, Misgav Am, Margaliot and Kiryat Shmona. Seventy-six people in northern Israel have been killed by Hezbollah cross-border rocket, missile and drone attacks since the start of the war, including 31 soldiers and six foreign citizens, according to the latest data provided by the Prime Minister’s Office, updated on Sunday. In addition, 729 people have been wounded, including 497 civilians and 232 soldiers. Of these, 29 civilians and 37 soldiers were severely injured; 63 civilians and 38 soldiers were moderately injured and 405 civilians and 157 soldiers were mildly injured. Dozens of Hezbollah launchers, rockets, weapons destroyed IDF forces operating in Southern Lebanon have located and destroyed dozens of multi-barrel launches, mortars, rocket caches and military equipment used in Hezbollah’s attacks against Israel over the past year, the military said on Monday. The IDF highlighted the work of troops from the 226th Reserve Brigade, operating under the command of the 146th Division, in finding these launchers both above and below ground. Troops also discovered and dismantled what the IDF said was an extensive underground terrorist facility, including weapons stockpiles, living quarters and a fully equipped and stocked kitchen. Also found at the site were 'combat equipment and operational maps, detailing Israeli settlements, ranges and plans, all ready for action,' according to the military. 'The troops are continuing to locate and dismantle terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon that Hezbollah used to plan and execute attacks against Israel.' Lebanese official: 90-95% of Dahieh residents evacuated A municipal leader from the Beirut area said on Monday that 90-95% of residents in the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahieh south of the capital have evacuated due to warnings from Israel’s military, Ynet reported. The Lebanese official added that significant destruction to the district has been reported, surpassing the damage seen during the month-long Second Lebanon War in 2006. Israel has been waging a devastating aerial campaign against Hezbollah throughout Lebanon, including its stronghold of Dahieh south of Beirut. According to Israeli estimates, the terror group has lost most of its arsenal to the ongoing strikes. Then-defense minister Yoav Gallant said in late October that Hezbollah is estimated to have lost over 80% of its long-range rockets since the start of the war. The IDF said on Nov. 12 that most of Hezbollah’s weapons storage sites and missile production facilities in Dahieh have been destroyed during the war, erasing two decades of buildup.

In historic first, female combat soldiers deployed in Lebanon	Their roles included intelligence gathering, identifying terrorist threats, and directing fire for ground and air forces. By Vered Weiss The IDF deployed female combat soldiers into Lebanon for the first time, The Jerusalem Post reports. Northern Command chief Maj.-Gen. Ori Gordin approved the deployment several weeks ago. The women served as members of a combat intelligence team stationed near the Syrian border in the Mount Dov region. Their roles included intelligence gathering, identifying terrorist threats, and directing fire for ground and air forces. The Jerusalem Post interviewed several female soldiers, including Corporal Tehila, 21, from the Eit Battalion. 'Southern Lebanon? We went in on foot. How much weight did we carry? Too much,' she said with a laugh. 'Around 40% of our body weight. We were preparing for a long ambush.' Corporal Shani, 20, described the mission in detail, 'We walked about 1.5 kilometers into Lebanon, established a position in the field, maintained camouflage, and began intelligence collection using observation tools. Operationally, we entered areas untouched by Israeli forces since the Second Lebanon War.' The soldiers provided valuable intelligence, including locating key terrorists hiding in buildings and details about anti-tank missile sites. The soldiers described how they guided an operation based on photographs that provided precise information about crucial locations and targets. In addition, their images allowed other soldiers to find weapons that were embedded within civilian areas. The team was behind enemy lines for 24 hours close to a location known to have a high concentration of Hezbollah terrorists. A fire broke out in the area and forced their evacuation. The soldiers focused mainly on concealing their positions and gathering intelligence, which provided a significant challenge. During the Israeli airstrike on Iran, four female pilots played a pivotal role in assisting the IAF in hitting crucial targets. The operation involved F-15 and F-16 fighter jets departing from Israel, and four female navigators from the Israeli Air Force (IAF) played a pivotal role in the historic mission.

Diamond Fraud Under the Microscope: Israeli Tech Promises Market ...	Rabinovich leveraged advanced spectroscopy and imaging techniques to identify subtle differences in diamond structure. By Pesach Benson, TPS A groundbreaking patent by a professor at Israel’s Ariel University promises to revolutionize the diamond industry by offering a reliable and cost-effective method for distinguishing between natural and synthetic diamonds. This innovation comes at a crucial time, as the market is increasingly flooded with synthetic diamonds whose lower prices pose significant challenges to the traditional gemstone sector. The commercial importance of this development lies in its ability to address a pressing industry need. Synthetic diamonds, produced in laboratories through advanced techniques like High Pressure, High Temperature (HPHT) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), have seen a dramatic rise in popularity, costing 20-40% less than natural diamonds. However, this affordability has disrupted the market, increasing demand for a dependable system to verify the origin of diamonds. The patented technology was developed by Dr. Yossi Rabinovitch as part of his doctoral thesis at Ariel University. Rabinovich leveraged advanced spectroscopy and imaging techniques to identify subtle differences in diamond structure. By analyzing fluorescence patterns under UV light or atomic-level variations through laser-based methods, Rabinovitch’s system can quickly and accurately determine a diamond’s origin. Unlike existing methods, this innovation offers a more affordable solution, making it accessible to a broader range of jewelers and gemologists. Visually, natural and synthethic diamonds are identical to the naked eye. Natural diamonds are formed deep within the Earth’s mantle over billions of years under extreme pressure and heat. This slow process creates unique inclusions and imperfections that serve as geological fingerprints. In contrast, synthetic diamonds are grown in controlled lab environments within weeks. While they share the same chemical composition and crystalline structure as natural diamonds, they often exhibit distinctive growth patterns and fewer imperfections. According to the 'Synthetic Diamonds – Global Strategic Business Report' released in October, the global market for synthetic diamonds is projected to reach $21.4 billion in 2030, compared to $15.3 billion in 2023. They are increasingly being used in electronics, optical, and cutting tool industries. Researchers are also exploring the use of nanodiamonds in the fields of medicine, aerospace, automobiles and electronics. However, criminals have also taken advantage of synthetic diamonds. In December 2023, police in Hong Kong arrested four people who exported synthetic diamonds to India with fictitious paperwork declaring them to be natural diamonds. The synthetic diamonds were the centerpiece of a $64 million money laundering scheme.

Israel will not allow Hamas to govern Gaza again, Netanyahu vows	Netanyahu reportedly said he ordered officials to prepare a plan aimed at replacing Hamas in the distribution of humanitarian aid by Nov. 21. By JNS Hamas continues to frustrate ongoing hostages-for-ceasefire negotiations in the hopes of ending the war and returning to power in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday. 'The only thing that Hamas wants is a deal that ends the war and for the IDF to leave the Strip in order to return to power,' the premier said, according to Walla. 'I am not ready to allow that under any circumstance.' Netanyahu told lawmakers that the Palestinian terrorist group 'sees the pressure' put on his government in both the domestic and international spheres, and believes it can thwart the talks to secure better conditions. The prime minister said during the closed-door meeting that he believes some 50 out of the 101 remaining hostages held by Hamas remain alive. He told committee members that while there is currently no concrete proposal on the table, various 'ideas have come up' in recent days. The Qatari-owned Al-Araby Al-Jadeed outlet cited a Hamas source as saying earlier this week that the Islamist organization’s leadership has cut all contact with those actually holding the hostages, due to 'strict security measures to protect the important negotiation card.' The source added that Hamas has refused to provide information on the whereabouts and status of the hostages, in particular those with U.S. citizenship, as it has not been offered 'compensation' by mediators. According to Channel 12, Netanyahu noted on Monday that while the Israel Defense Forces operation in Gaza has destroyed most of Hamas’s 'military' infrastructure, its ruling capabilities remain largely intact. Netanyahu reportedly said he ordered officials to prepare a plan aimed at replacing Hamas in the distribution of humanitarian aid by Nov. 21. Also on Monday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who leads the Religious Zionism Party, told reporters that the IDF should occupy the entire northern part of the Strip until the hostages are released. Jerusalem needs to 'inform Hamas in clear terms that if the hostages do not return, we exercise our sovereignty and stay there forever,' he said, adding, 'Then, Hamas will have the motivation to keep them alive.' Roughly 1,200 Israeli Jews were murdered by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, thousands more were wounded and 251 others were taken into the Gaza Strip. On-and-off indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have dragged on for months, with the U.S., Egypt and Qatar acting as intermediaries. The return of the hostages still held by Hamas terrorists after 409 days remains the 'most important value goal' in the ongoing war, Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated in a statement on Sunday.

Report: Lebanon accepts US ceasefire deal disarming Hezbollah	Hezbollah reportedly sending its response to an American ceasefire proposal which would require the terror group be demilitarized and Israel given the right to retaliate in Lebanon for any ceasefire violations. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The government of Lebanon has accepted the United States proposal for a ceasefire between Israel and the Hezbollah terrorist group, according to a report Sunday, while Hezbollah has sent its official response to the peace plan. Late Sunday night, Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International (LBCI) reported that Beirut has accepted, with some caveats, the framework for a truce submitted by the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon, and that the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group Hezbollah has already penned a response, which is being forwarded to the United States. The report stated that while Lebanon has accepted the general outline of the ceasefire proposal, Beirut has asked for clarifications regarding some provisions and is pushing for alterations to others. In particular, Lebanon is seeking greater steps to limit Israel's ability to operate in Lebanese territory should the ceasefire be violated. According to the Saudi-based Asharq al-Awsat daily, Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri - a member of the Amal Shi'ite nationalist movement - is serving as interlocuter between Biden administration envoy Amos Hochstein and Hezbollah. Hochstein is set to visit Beirut on Tuesday in a bid to push forward with a ceasefire deal. According to a report Monday morning by Lebanon's Nidaa al-Watan outlet, the American ceasefire proposal centers around three main points. First, the Hezbollah terror group would be required to demilitarize - not only south of the Litani River, near the Israeli frontier, but also north of it. This provision, the report said, is considered non-negotiable by the U.S., due in part to Israeli insistence on the disarming of the Iran-backed proxy group. In addition, the draft submitted to Lebanon calls for the establishment of a supervisory committee to oversee the implementation of the ceasefire, to ensure adherence to the deal and monitory violations, and to ensure the fulfillment of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. The August 11th, 2006 resolution calls for the disarming of Hezbollah and removal of Hezbollah forces from south of the Litani River, and the cessation of fighting along the Israeli-Lebanese frontier. The proposed committee would be led by an American military officer, who would be joined by a French counterpart. Furthermore, the American proposal would back Israel's demand for a right to respond militarily in Lebanon should the ceasefire be violated, but only after the aforementioned committee is given an opportunity to reestablish calm.

‘Anarchist AG declared war on the government’ – Officials	Attorney General's inaction in the face of violent left-wing protests has caused 'unprecedented damage to the rule of law and public order,' says minister. By World Israel News Government ministers and other coalition lawmakers are raising the alarm about what they say is the illegal intervention of Attorney General Gali Baharav Miara in government matters, with many calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fire her. The demand for Baharav Miara's ouster comes on the heels of a recent decision from her office that Public Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir - whose ministry includes Israel's police - does not have the right to dictate police policies, nor replace the head of the police. Netanyahu should fire Ben Gvir if he does not stop attempting to change police policy and appointing senior figures within the force, Baharav Miara wrote. In response, Ben Gvir said on Monday that Baharav Miara 'has declared war on the government.' 'Pay attention, my fellow ministers, to what they are asking the prime minister to fire me for: because I backed our soldiers, because I spoke out against [Arab Joint List MKs] Ahmad Tibi and Ofer Cassif, because I criticized the courts,' Ben Gvir said. Baharav Miara is 'essentially the most dangerous person to the State of Israel,' Regional Cooperation Minister David Amsalem told Hebrew-language news site Kikar HaShabbat. The minister referenced ongoing incitement against Netanyahu, including an incident on Saturday night which saw anti-government demonstrators fire flares at the premier's residence, sparking a fire. 'She allows the left to run wild, to do whatever it wants,' Amsalem added. Communications Minister Dr. Shlomi Karhi noted that Baharav Miara had not clamped down on increasingly intense incitement against Netanyahu, and that her negligence could potentially lead to the prime minister's murder. 'The attorney general must go home today,' Karhi said in the Knesset plenum. 'If someone comes to kill you — including through weakness and agreement through silence — rise up and fire them,' he said, referencing a Talmudic self-defense ruling which says one should kill an aggressor in self-defense. Diaspora Miniter Amichai Chikli wrote on social media platform X that Baharav Miara's inaction in the face of violent left-wing protests has caused 'unprecedented damage to the rule of law and public order.' Chikli added that 'in her serial disregard of wild incitement, she is a silent accomplice. The State of Israel cannot afford to have an anarchist in the post of legal adviser.'

Hunting Jews in broad daylight: Europe’s new reality	Daniel Levy, a lifelong resident of Amsterdam, says ‘What we’re facing is far more than harassment—it’s a full-blown pogrom.’ By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News Amsterdam, a city that once symbolized tolerance and freedom, is now a battleground where Jews are hunted in the streets, targeted by violent mobs, and abandoned by their own government. Let’s call this what it is: a pogrom. The Jewish community is under siege, and the world is silent. This isn’t just neglect—it’s complicity. At Paradiso, one of Amsterdam’s most iconic concert venues, the depths of antisemitism were on full display. On November 12, 2024, a performer praised the so-called '#Jodenjacht'—a reference to the violent targeting of Jews—while the audience responded with enthusiastic applause. A room filled with cheers for a modern-day 'Jew hunt.' This chilling moment encapsulates the normalization of antisemitic violence in Europe and signals the breakdown of any pretense of safety for Jews in Amsterdam. Daniel Levy, a lifelong resident of Amsterdam, doesn’t mince words. 'What we’re facing is far more than harassment—it’s a full-blown pogrom,' he says. 'Fireworks were strategically exploded near hotels and Airbnbs known to host Jewish and Israeli visitors. Groups of Moroccan Muslims roamed the streets, stopping anyone they believed to be Jewish or Israeli, demanding identification.' This isn’t random chaos. This is organized, targeted violence. Cab drivers exposed Jewish tourists’ locations online, making it easy for mobs to attack them. Some Israelis were driven far from their destinations and dropped off in dangerous areas, where gangs were lying in wait. Incredibly, attackers even traveled from Germany to join in the mayhem. Amsterdam, a supposed safe haven, has become a death trap for anyone visibly Jewish. The Police: Protectors or Enablers? Where were the police during this pogrom? Busy harassing Jews trying to defend themselves. According to Levy, some officers openly displayed 'Free Palestine' stickers, a glaring symbol of their sympathies. This isn’t just negligence; it’s betrayal. Take the case of Philip Zeitler Prins, a Jewish resident who has endured harassment for over three years. His home has been defaced with Palestinian flags and hateful graffiti, and threats are a regular occurrence. After years of pleading, a police officer finally visited his home—not to protect him, but to inspect the flags. Despite clear evidence of harassment, law enforcement refused to take action, citing a lack of 'definitive proof.' They wouldn’t even question the neighbors. Zeitler Prins recorded the entire interaction, exposing the police’s cowardice. This isn’t law enforcement; it’s law abandonment. Politicians Fueling the Fire The failure isn’t limited to the police—it goes all the way to the top. Amsterdam’s political leaders are not just passive; they’re active participants in this crisis. GreenLeft council members openly chant slogans like 'From the river to the sea,' a call for Israel’s destruction. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations, supposedly banned, continue with full permission from city officials. The message is clear: Amsterdam’s leadership will protect hate speech over human lives. Silence Is Complicity Where are Amsterdam’s non-Jewish residents? Silent. And that silence speaks volumes. Instead of standing with their Jewish neighbors, many align with the pro-Palestinian narrative, even when it devolves into outright antisemitism. The city is now plastered with pro-Hamas banners and graffiti calling for intifada. 'If a Jewish resident tears down a Palestinian flag, it’s seen as provocative,' Levy explains. 'But these hate symbols are defended as free speech, while the very real danger we face every day is ignored.' This isn’t ignorance. This is willful blindness. Fighting Back: Betar Leads the Charge While Amsterdam’s leaders fail, others are stepping up. Ron Torossian, Chairman of Betar USA, is leading the charge to protect Jewish communities. 'Betar is built on the principles of Ze’ev Jabotinsky: fight or flee in the face of oppression. We choose to fight,' Torossian declares. Betar is organizing rallies, building alliances, and mobilizing communities across Europe to counter antisemitism head-on. 'We’re not just reacting; we’re creating a sustained movement of Jewish pride and resilience,' Torossian says. 'We refuse to back down.' Time for Real Action Here’s the hard truth: Antisemitism is no longer simmering beneath the surface—it’s boiling over. Amsterdam is a litmus test for Europe’s future, and right now, it’s failing. Steven Spielberg and Adam Sandler, both celebrated figures who have capitalized on their Jewish identity in their work—Spielberg through documenting the Holocaust in Schindler’s List and Sandler through his public celebration of Jewish pride—remain conspicuously silent in the face of the growing crisis facing Jews in Amsterdam and beyond. Their silence is particularly glaring given their influence and platforms, which could bring much-needed attention to the dire threat of Islamic antisemitism and government apathy. Betar, a global Zionist organization, is holding rallies in front of their homes to call on them to break their silence and stand in solidarity with the Jewish communities under siege. As Ze’ev Jabotinsky once said, ‘Silence is despicable,’ and in times like these, silence from prominent Jewish figures is not just disappointing—it’s dangerous. Europe’s Jews are standing at a precipice, and the international community must decide: Will you watch another Holocaust unfold, or will you act now? The choice is stark and unforgiving. Antisemitism isn’t freedom of speech. It’s not a political opinion. It’s hatred, plain and simple—and hatred, when left unchecked, metastasizes into violence. If the world allows Amsterdam to become a breeding ground for pogroms, the question won’t be if it spreads but when. This is not just a Jewish issue. This is a human issue. To every leader, influencer, and policymaker: the time for neutrality has passed. If you refuse to speak up, history will remember your silence as complicity. In the words of Ze’ev Jabotinsky: 'Silence is despicable.' Stand with the Jewish people, or stand on the wrong side of history. We will not apologize. We will not retreat. And we will not forget who stood with us—and who didn’t.

Hamas hosted by Turkey after being kicked out of Qatar	Qatar, where Hamas' operations had been based for years, recently came under intense American pressure to expel the terror group from its territory. By World Israel News Staff Turkey has warmly welcomed Hamas' senior leadership after the terror group's officials were forced out of Qatar, according to Hebrew-language media reports. Qatar, where Hamas' operations had been based for years, recently came under intense American pressure to expel the terror group from its territory. Earlier in November, Washington told Qatar to eject Hamas leaders from the country, due to the terror group rejected hostage deals numerous times and murdering several captives, including American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Doha announced that it would no longer serve as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, citing the stalled negotiations for a deal that would see a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the release of the nearly 100 hostages still held in Gaza. Hebrew-language media reported that the terror group's top brass were asked to leave Qatar, though they weren't given a specific deadline by which they needed to depart. According to a Times of Israel report, many of Hamas' most important surviving politburo members are establishing a new base of operations in Ankara. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly praised Hamas and stressed that his country will remain friendly towards the terror group. 'No one can make us qualify Hamas as a terrorist organization,' he said during a March speech in Istanbul. 'Turkey is a country that speaks openly with Hamas leaders and firmly backs them.' In April, Erdogan hosted the now-assassinated head of Hamas' politburo, Ismail Haniyeh, in Istanbul. During the hours-long meeting, 'President Erdogan stated that Palestinians’ acting in unison is of vital importance during this time, that the most robust response to Israel and the way to victory go through unity and integrity, and that Palestine’s rightful cause and facts be communicated more effectively against Israel, which misleads international public opinion,' according to a summary posted by the Turkish Directorate of Communications in a post on social media platform X.

Comparing Trump to Hitler is an ‘insult’ to millions of Jews, say...	New York's Democratic mayor tussles with hosts of The View over the incendiary political rhetoric on the Left likening President-elect Donald Trump to Hitler and Fascists of the 1930s. By World Israel News Staff New York City Mayor Eric Adams urged fellow Democrats last week to tone down their rhetoric and protested attempts to compare former President and President-elect Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler and to members of fascist movements of the 1930s and 1940s. Adams, who is currently under indictment for bribery and campaign finance violations, appeared on ABC's 'The View' Friday to call for more bipartisan cooperation and less incendiary political rhetoric. In particular, Adams took aim at extreme denunciations of Trump on the Left. Questioned co-host Sunny Hostin regarding allegations that his recent public statements rejecting comparisons between Trump and World War II-era fascists were motivated by a desire to secure a presidential pardon from the incoming president. Ahead of the November election, Adams criticized Vice President Kamala Harris after she responded to the question of whether she considered Trump to be a fascist. 'Yes, I do,' Harris said. 'I have heard those terms hurled at me by some political leaders in the city, using terms like Hitler and fascist. My answer is no, I know what Hitler has done, and I know what a fascist regime looks like,' Adams said in late October. Speaking with The View Friday, Adams doubled down on his denial of wrong-doing, while castigating attempts to compare political rivals to Nazi leaders. 'We reached a point in this country where we no longer want to engage in conversation. They were even calling him Hitler,' Adams lamented. 'That was an insult to the millions of Jews and others who died — we know what Hitler did and what I said to our country when I’m on the streets talking to my young people who are protesting on college campuses [with] Hamas signs and calling for the destruction of groups, I said we have to bring down this rhetoric,' he said. 'We have to start engaging in conversation. You know Obama said it right and I agreed. This is not the divided states, this is the United States. We are the greatest country on the globe and people are watching us name-calling.'

Suicide drone from Iraq launched towards southern Israeli city of...	Israeli interceptor missile failed to hit incoming Iraqi drone targeting Eilat, landed in Jordan. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An Iron Dome interceptor fell near Aqaba in Jordan Sunday night after failing to hit its target, an incoming UAV from Iraq. Jordanian news agency Petra reported its military’s confirmation that a 'flying object' had hit in the coastal city, which is located just several hundreds of meters from Eilat at Israel’s southern tip. It reported that there no serious injuries or damage resulted from the subsequent impact. Sappers then arrived to take care of the dangerous debris and citizens were told not to approach the area. Videos uploaded to social media show the interceptor descending outside the Ayla inlet, a luxury development in Aqaba, and two explosions could be heard, one right after the other. The first was seemingly the detonation of the anti-missile’s head that was to have hit the UAV aiming to cause destruction in Eilat, and the second was the result of the interceptor hitting the ground. For its part, the IDF announced that when the incoming missile was discovered, 'several interceptors were launched towards the target. One of them fell in an open space. No reports of casualties were received and the incident is being investigated.' One or more of the other interceptors had hit the target successfully, destroying the threat before it reached Israel’s borders, the army added. Some Eilat residents took to Facebook to complain that they had first heard two very strong, loud explosions and only then the warning siren had sounded in the town. Others said that after the siren went off, they heard another two explosions, seemingly confirming that after the first interceptor went astray, a second had worked as it should. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella network of Iranian-backed Shiite Islamist terrorist groups, claimed responsibility for launching the drone. These groups have arsenals composed of cruise missiles, kamikaze drones and rockets of Iranian origin. They have been launching their long-range missiles sporadically at Israel since November 2023 in support of their fellow Iranian proxy, Hamas, in its war against Israel. A few have managed to get through Israel’s air defense. Notably, last month a drone launched from Iraq killed two Israeli soldiers and injured 24, two of them seriously, in an army base on the Golan Heights in northern Israel.

US will sanction ICC if it pursues Netanyahu arrest, incoming Sen...	Senator John Thune, the next Majority Leader of the Senate, warned the International Criminal Court that the US will impose sanctions on the court if it moves forward with plans to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israel's former defense minister. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The next leader of the upper chamber of the U.S. Congress warned the International Criminal Court at The Hague Sunday that the United States will impose sanctions on the tribunal should it insist on moving forward with plans to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. South Dakota Senator John Thune took to X/Twitter Sunday, penning a scathing post, castigating the ICC and chief prosecutor Karim Khan over their 'outrageous' bid to pursue the arrests of Netanyahu and Gallant. 'If the ICC and its prosecutor do not reverse their outrageous and unlawful actions to pursue arrest warrants against Israeli officials, the Senate should immediately pass sanctions legislation, as the House has already done on a bipartisan basis,' Thune tweeted. 'If Majority Leader Schumer does not act, the Senate Republican majority will stand with our key ally Israel and make this – and other supportive legislation – a top priority in the next Congress.' Thune, who currently serves as Senate Minority Whip, is set to replace Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell as head of the Republican Senate Caucus on January 3rd, as the 119th Congress begins its two-year session. With Republicans having picked up a total of four seats in the Senate, giving them a 53-47 majority in the upper chamber, Thune will also become Senate Majority Leader on January 3rd, replacing the incumbent, New York Democrat Chuck Schumer. Hours after Thune's tweet, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson noted that the lower chamber of Congress passed a measure to sanction the ICC in June, adding that under Schumer, the Senate had yet to take up the proposal. 'The House voted in JUNE to sanction the ICC if they proceed with their illegitimate plot, but Chuck Schumer has refused to bring the bill up in the Senate,' Johnson tweeted. 'Grateful to see the resolve of Sen John Thune for BOTH of our chambers to stand TOGETHER with Israel in the new Congress.'

‘Totally surreal,’ Jewish Arizonan wins $1 million from Elon Musk...	Offenhartz’s plans for the windfall include charitable giving to Big Brothers, the Jewish National Fund, and to Jewish education in Phoenix. By Dave Gordon, JNS After Joshua Offenhartz decided to sign a petition from Elon Musk’s America Political Action Committee, which offered a potential $47 per referral and a shot at $1 million for those in battleground states, he sent it in a group text to family and friends. 'They loved it, but they thought I was crazy,' the Jewish lawyer in Phoenix told JNS. Signatories to the petition state that they support constitutional principles, with a particular focus on free expression and gun ownership rights. 'I read it. I largely agreed that we need the First Amendment to protect our freedoms of speech, our freedoms of religion,' said Offenhartz, who received the petition in September. 'As an attorney, I believe in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments—the right to protection and privacy, the right to due process.' 'It’s election season, so I sort of sign-up for everything because you never know where interesting information is going to come from that you share with family and friends,' he told JNS. On Nov. 3, Offenhartz was on a walk with his children, sharing literature for local Arizona candidates when he received a text message from an unknown number informing him that America PAC would be in his neighborhood that day. It wanted to 'stop by and say, ‘Thank you for the work you did.’' Offenhartz’s wife, Shira Offenhartz, thought the family was in the money, but the attorney didn’t want either of them to get their hopes up. Then a large SUV pulled up in front of the house, a team got out and someone opened the trunk and revealed an oversized check. 'They walked up to the door, and it was sort of like Publishers Clearing House,' he told JNS. 'They handed me this $1 million check.'

Visiting Israel has also shaped Offenhartz’s Jewish identity, he told JNS. He has the 'dubious achievement of having traveled to Israel when conflict breaks out.' After graduating high school, he took part in a USY Birthright trip. While visiting Rosh Hanikra along the northern border in 2006, Hezbollah fired at Israel and kidnapped soldiers. 'That was just real, and an amazing experience to be there, to see the places that I learned about, to walk in the footsteps of our ancestors—very powerful and very moving,' he said of the trip. 'Then being and seeing firsthand the security threat, but then seeing how fragile Israel was firsthand, and having parts of the trip rerouted and rescheduled because of threats, having to shelter in place at times,' he added. 'That made it very real.' 'That really solidified any advocacy that I may have been wavering on growing up,' Offenhartz said. In 2007, he returned to Israel to mark Hillel’s 75th anniversary, and in 2013, he led a Birthright contingent. On the latter trip, the group left a tour of Yad Vashem in Jerusalem when Jerusalem was struck by rocket fire. It ran into the museum’s parking garage basement shelter. 'I’ve been there during times of conflict. I’ve also been there in times of peace. It helps with my spirituality and my personal belief, but also it helps solidify for me that our enemies tell us what they really think they mean,' he told JNS. 'It really motivates me, because I think we take that blessing for granted, because, as we saw on Oct. 7, Israel is so fragile,' he added. ‘Moving the needle’ Offenhartz has long thought highly of the Tesla and Twitter owner, whose PAC so unexpectedly just gave him $1 million. 'I’m unashamed and unafraid to say that I think that he is a brilliant businessman, and I really am impressed that he is walking-the-walk when most people just talk-the-talk of things that we want to see in the 21st century,' he said. Offenhartz’s grandfather worked on the Apollo space program. 'I’m in love with the idea of SpaceX and Starlink and space exploration,' he said. 'I don’t own a Tesla, but I love the idea of electric cars.' His first private sector job was in and his master’s thesis was about solar energy. 'I believe in that too,' he said. 'I’ve always admired Elon Musk as a businessman and the things that he was doing.' 'Maybe if the government wasn’t so hard on the man, trying to do great things. I think that he showed the world, in a different way, that there are smart minds outside of politics that can come up with ideas to move the needle in ways that our political class hasn’t thought of,' he added. 'As long as he keeps fighting for values, I certainly can support that.'

Hamas supporters lay siege to British banking giant over Israel s...	The unruly mob also harassed customers by urging them to close their accounts. By Jewish Breaking News Barclays Bank faced widespread disruption on Saturday as hundreds of Hamas supporters besieged branches throughout the UK, demanding the bank sever its financial ties with Israel. According to the Telegraph, the most significant disruption occurred in Brighton where dozens of anti-Israel protesters forced the branch to shut its doors after blocking the bank’s entrance with a banner reading 'Stop Arming Israel.' The unruly mob also harassed customers by urging them to close their accounts. While some bank locations maintained operations under the watchful eye of police and security guards, the demonstrations organized by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) spread across multiple cities, including a notable gathering in Brent, where a dozen protesters occupied the entrance while displaying 'Free Palestine' banners. Similar scenes played out in Glasgow, Leeds, Oxford, and Coventry. The PSC has accused Barclays of 'bankrolling Israel’s genocidal assault on Palestinians,' alleging the bank has invested more than £2 billion in arms companies selling weapons to Israel, while providing additional financial services worth £6.1 billion. In response, Barclays defended its position, maintaining it is 'committed to respecting human rights.' 'As a universal bank, Barclays provides a range of client services in relation to the shares of publicly listed companies, including those in the defense and security sector,' a statement by Barclays reads. 'Barclays is committed to respecting human rights as defined by the International Bill of Human Rights and takes account of other internationally accepted human rights standards and frameworks. 'We have a published statement on defense and security which sets out our policy positions and governs any business activities in the defense and security sector, including setting restrictions on certain financing activities and requiring enhanced due diligence as appropriate on clients in the sector.'

IDF eliminates Hezbollah media chief in Beirut strike	In October, Afif boasted, 'It won't be long before we take Israeli captives.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An Israeli strike in central Beirut killed a Hezbollah media chief on Sunday, Reuters reports. Mohammad Afif, who served as the long-time media advisor to the deceased head of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in the Ras al-Nabaa neighborhood of Beirut. The strike targeted the Ba'ath Party offices in Lebanon, and the head of the party, Ali Hijazi, told the Lebanese media that Afif was dead. Before the strike, IDF Arab Media Spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted on X/Twitter a map of places Israel was planning to target. The post was intended for civilians in the Haret Hreik and Burj al-Barajneh areas as an evacuation notice. Reuters reported that civilians in the Ras al-Nabaa did not receive evacuation orders. In addition to serving as media adviser to Nasrallah, Mohammed Afif ran the Al-Manar television station before taking over the media office. In October, Afif boasted, 'It won't be long before we take Israeli captives.' Although he acknowledged that Hezbollah did not have Israeli hostages, he said the terror organization 'came close' to kidnapping Israelis. He also said that Hezbollah was 'only in the first round' as the IDF fought terrorists in Southern Lebanon. A security official told Maariv that eliminating Afif has 'significant implications.' 'Firstly, such an action deals a mortal blow to the Shia population and Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon,' he explained. 'In addition, it could further impair the organization's ability to influence the Lebanese public and operate with its own members. This individual was responsible for propaganda, conveying messages, and was a dominant figure for the organization's leadership and in engaging with the Lebanese public,' the official said. IDF reported that the air force had carried out 'intelligence-based strikes on six Hezbollah military targets' in the Dahieh area. The IDF also targeted weapons storage facilities, command centers, and military sites.

Israeli breakthrough could halve radiation sessions for prostate ...	The study aims not only to improve patient experience but also to optimize healthcare resources. By Pesach Benson, TPS An Israeli medical breakthrough could cut in half the number of radiation treatments needed for prostate cancer patients. Prostate cancer remains one of the most common malignancies among men worldwide, with approximately 2,500 new cases diagnosed annually in Israel. Half of these are detected early, when radiation therapy is a highly effective treatment option. However, the current standard of five sessions requires significant time, preparation, and emotional resilience from patients. Research conducted by doctors at the Davidoff Comprehensive Cancer Center at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering high-dose external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer in just two sessions, without compromising safety or outcomes. 'Reducing the number of radiation treatments from five to two can significantly ease the physical and emotional toll on patients, making the treatment process more tolerable,' said Dr. Elisha Fredman, who led the research. 'Treating patients more efficiently also allows them to start therapy sooner, benefiting everyone involved.' Fredman drew inspiration from a more invasive approach called brachytherapy. This technique involves the surgical implantation of radioactive particles into the prostate, effectively treating the cancer in just two sessions. Building on this concept, Dr. Fredman developed a non-invasive alternative using external beam radiation, delivering high doses over two sessions instead of five. The study aims not only to improve patient experience but also to optimize healthcare resources. By shortening treatment schedules, the hospital can treat more patients and reduce waiting times, all while minimizing long-term side effects. Although similar studies are underway in New York, London, and Toronto, Fredman’s study is expected to surpass these in scale, marking a significant milestone in global cancer research. Since the study’s inception, more than 40 patients have participated, with promising results. 'The response to treatment has been excellent so far, with no unusual side effects,' Fredman reported.

Oct. 7th victims’ families sue Iran for supporting Hamas	The families are seeking financial compensation from Iran under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Anti-Terrorism Act. By World Israel News Staff The families of victims murdered in the October 7th terror onslaught are suing Iran in an American court, presenting previously-unseen evidence that the Islamic Republic was directly involved in supporting the plan for the massacre. The suit, filed in Washington D.C. Federal Court by those whose relatives held U.S. citizenship, charges that Iran had advanced direct knowledge of the October 7th plan and provided extensive funding to Hamas for the attack. Documents presented in the lawsuit, which appear to have been obtained directly from Hamas leadership, detailed how a prominent Iranian military commander had met with a senior Hamas official just months before the attack. The Iranian official assured his Hamas counterpart that Tehran would fully support the slaughter. The terror group's slain leader, Yahya Sinwar, demanded that Iran funnel Hamas $7 million on a monthly basis for the upcoming 'big project' - a code name for the October 7th murder, rape, kidnapping, and mutilation spree. 'Hard, incontrovertible evidence of who funded Hamas is now becoming available in the form of documents, bank records and the like, and we intend to hold those parties accountable, in the courts of the United States or elsewhere, for however long it takes,' said attorneys Gary Osen and Lee Wolosky, who are leading the case, said in a statement. The families are seeking financial compensation from Iran under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Anti-Terrorism Act. All the groups named in the lawsuit, which include Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are all officially designated as terror organizations by the U.S. government. 46 Americans were murdered by Hamas on October 7th, including children, babies, and elderly people. 12 were taken hostage to Gaza, where seven remain today. Three of those American hostages are confirmed to be dead.

Kushner to serve as informal Trump Mideast adviser	Kushner’s close ties to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as well as to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could allow for more private contacts. By JNS President-elect Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner will reportedly play an important role in U.S. Middle East policy, even though he will not formally be part of the administration. Regional diplomats and Trump allies recognize that Kushner—who has significant financial interests in the Gulf—has forged deep relationships from his position as a senior White House adviser during the first Trump administration, CNN reported on Friday. 'No one on the incoming team has what Jared has, and that is trust. Jared earned it, he didn’t have it at the beginning. He earned it. That takes time to build,' said a diplomat from a Middle Eastern nation. 'Friendships are forever in this region,' an Israeli source who dealt with the first Trump administration told CNN. 'My assumption is that his role is much more in his hands than anybody else’s.' After President Joe Biden took office four years ago, Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, moved to Florida and largely avoided politics. He founded an investment fund shortly after leaving Washington with major backing from sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf, including $2 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Kushner’s close ties to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as well as to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could allow for more private contacts, the report noted. The second Trump administration is certain to make the expansion of the landmark 2020 Abraham Accords, which Kushner spearheaded, a cornerstone of its Middle East program with a push toward reaching a historic normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia expected to be front and center of U.S. foreign policy efforts next year.

Israel security agency chief says firing flares at Netanyahu’s re...	Ronen Bar: 'The firing of flash bombs at the residence of the prime minister is the gravest kind of incident and is far from legitimate protest.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Ronen Bar, head of Israel's Security Agency (Shin Bet) said that those who fired flares at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea will be dealt with severely and the incident shows a 'dangerous level' of activism. After three people were arrested in connection with the firing of flares at the Prime Minister's residence in the early hours of Sunday morning, Ronen Bar said, 'The firing of flash bombs at the residence of the prime minister is the gravest kind of incident and is far from legitimate protest.' 'This is rising to dangerous levels' of activism, he added. Bar said that Shin Bet is required by law to protect symbols of the Israeli government, such as the Prime Minister's residence, and that violent acts against these symbols would not be tolerated. He said, 'We acted promptly with the police to identify and arrest those suspects involved in the incident, using all the tools at our disposal.' Shin Bet and Lahav 433 investigated the incident shortly after it occurred and called it a 'dangerous escalation.' No members of the Netanyahu family were home during the flares' firing, and no damage was reported to the home. The incident drew strong criticism from members of the government and members of the Opposition. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and National Unity chairman Benny Gantz strongly condemned the incident and said those responsible should be brought to justice. Yisrael Beytenu chief Avigdor Liberman said it 'signifies an escalation in the attempt to harm the democratic institutions of the State of Israel.' 'Full backing must be given to the Shin Bet and the Israel Police in the investigation, and those involved must be brought to justice,' Liberman added. President Isaac Herzog said he had spoken to the Shin Bet chief about 'the urgent need to investigate and deal with those responsible for the incident as soon as possible.' 'The flames must not be allowed to escalate. I am again warning against increased violence in the public sphere,' Herzog wrote.

Israel mulls sending captured Russian weapons to Ukraine	Russian arms include Kornet anti-tank guided missiles, Strela shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, RPG-29 Vampire and other weapons. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Russian-made weapons captured from Hezbollah and Hamas may soon find their way to Ukraine as Israeli lawmakers consider legislation authorizing the transfers. Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk told The Press Service of Israel he praised the symbolism of what the move represents. 'The Ukrainian reaction is positive, but in order to make such a decision, you don’t need Knesset laws,' Korniychuk told TPS-IL. According to the ambassador, if the goal was simply to transfer the weapons discretely, this could be done by the Israeli Minister of Defense alone, without the need for Knesset legislation. 'This [Knesset legislation] was to make it more public,' Korniychuk said. 'I’ve already heard all these ideas of not provoking Russia. But given everything, Russia hosting Hamas leaders, supplying Hezbollah with weapons, and more, what else can you provoke?' 'We have the same enemy, Iran, Russia, and the Iranian proxies,' he added. The bill, which has been placed on the Knesset table for early discussion, specifically allows for weaponry confiscated during military operations, in Lebanon and in territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority, to the Ukrainian armed forces. The legislation is being spearheaded by Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel and MK Dan Ilouz. Based on photos and videos released by the Israel Defense Forces, the seized Russian arms include Kornet anti-tank guided missiles, Strela shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, RPG-29 Vampire and RPG-27 Tavolga rocket-propelled grenade launchers, Metis-M anti-tank missile systems, and MRO-A rocket-propelled anti-personnel flamethrowers. Also confiscated were stockpiles of Kalashnikov rifles. It isn’t clear if the weapons were directly provided by Russia or delivered by third parties. Under the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Gottheimer announces bid for NJ governor	As New Jersey’s only Jewish congressional representative, Gottheimer has been recognized by Jewish groups for his efforts to promote Holocaust education and combatting antisemitism. By Andrew Bernard, JNS Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) announced his bid for the New Jersey governor’s office on Friday, joining a crowded Democratic field to replace term-limited Gov. Tim Murphy (D) in the 2025 election. Gottheimer, who is Jewish and one of Israel’s staunchest advocates on Capitol Hill, announced his candidacy at Runway Diner in South Hackensack with a focus on lowering the cost of living in the Garden State. 'Life in Jersey has become too damn expensive,' Gottheimer said. 'Today, I’m launching my campaign for governor to cut your taxes and costs and to make Jersey affordable again.' Gottheimer has represented New Jersey’s 5th Congressional District along the northern border with New York since he won the seat from a Republican incumbent in 2016. He handily won re-election on Nov. 5 by an 11-point margin. As New Jersey’s only Jewish congressional representative, Gottheimer has been recognized by Jewish groups for his efforts to promote Holocaust education and has been one of the leading voices in the House on combating antisemitism and supporting Israel. 'We need to bring the full force of the law against the antisemites who are harassing Jewish or any other communities all over this state,' Gottheimer said in his announcement speech, adding that he supports putting more cops on the beat. Other Democrats, who have announced their intention to run for the governor’s office, include Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop (who is Jewish), with Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) reportedly set to announce her candidacy later this week. Long thought of as a Democratic bastion that occasionally elects Republican moderates, New Jersey has emerged as a more competitive battleground in statewide races in recent elections. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris beat President-elect Donald Trump in the state by just five points in November, and Gov. Murphy beat his Republican challenger in the 2021 election by a 51-48 margin. That challenger, former New Jersey General Assembly member Jack Ciattarelli, is once again seeking the Republican nomination alongside five other declared contenders. Gottheimer in his announcement promised to do 'battle' with Trump over issues like the state and local tax deduction, while also touting his bipartisan record as a co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus. 'The election outcome was a horrible loss for America,' Gottheimer said in a video accompanying his announcement. 'Every candidate running for governor agrees we need to stand up to Trump on the major issues.' Trump, who capped the SALT deduction as part of his 2017 tax cuts, pledged in the 2024 campaign that he would lift the cap in a social media post aimed at voters on Long Island. 'I will turn it around, get SALT back, lower your taxes and so much more,' Trump wrote. Other key issues in the New Jersey gubernatorial race include New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s plan to impose a $9 congestion charge on drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street starting in January, potentially affecting a huge number of New Jersey commuters and businesses. Gottheimer vowed to defeat the toll charge. 'To our friends in the Empire State, let me say this: We beat New York’s outrageous Congestion Tax once,' he said. 'I’m ready to lead the fight to stop it again.' Today, I’m launching my campaign for Governor to lower your taxes, lower your costs, and to make Jersey affordable again. I will help you and your family get ahead and I’ll do it while protecting our Jersey Values. pic.twitter.com/XrZm595yD4 &mdash; Josh Gottheimer (@Josh4Jersey) November 15, 2024 The post Gottheimer announces bid for NJ governor appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/gottheimer-announces-bid-for-nj-governor/	2024-11-17T08:32:52-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/shutterstock_2201068997-scaled.jpg
‘A miracle’ – None injured as missile destroys Haifa synagogue	The missile hit exactly where we pray,' says regular worshipper at Avot v'Banim synagogue. By World Israel News Staff A historic synagogue with an active congregation was destroyed by a Hezbollah missile on Saturday night, just a few hours after prayers were held in the building. The Avot v'Banim synagogue in Haifa's central Carmel neighborhood was directly struck by the rocket, with dozens of nearby apartments damaged by shrapnel and numerous cars set ablaze by the blast. 'We had a great miracle. Two hours before [the rocket hit] we were still praying here in the synagogue. Look what happened to us here,' Gershon Zaft, a regular worshipper at the synagogue, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'It's a great miracle that there are no casualties,' Zaft stressed. 'The missile hit exactly where we pray. It will take a long time to rebuild our synagogue.' Clips ciruclating on social media of the scene showed that the synagogue's roof was completely destroyed, with much of the structure appearing to implode. 'The destruction is extensive,' Gideon Goldenbar, the synagogue's gabbay (caretaker), told Ynet. 'We hope that we will be able to salvage some Torah scrolls.' The efforts to retrieve Torah scrolls and other holy objects from the synagogue are complicated by the huge amount of debris and the weather, as a rainstorm is expected in the coming days. The synagogue is located in a historic Templar-style building, erected in the 1800s by Germans in Ottoman-era Israel. The missile strike comes on the heels of reports that Israel and Lebanon are nearing a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict. While Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar recently confirmed that Israel is 'closer than ever' to reaching a diplomatic agreement that would see Hezbollah stop its daily rocket, missile, and explosive drone attacks against Israel, the timeline for such a deal remains unclear.

Pope Francis calls for genocide investigation of Israel	After calling Israel's wars against Hamas and Hezbollah terror groups 'immoral,' the Vatican pontiff is now calling for a probe into the IDF's conduct, citing accusations 'by some experts' that ongoing war has 'characteristics of genocide.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Pope Francis has called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by IDF forces during the ongoing wars against the Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, according to an upcoming book. On Sunday, the Italian daily La Stampa published excerpts from Hernán Reyes Alcaide's new book, Hope Never Disappoints. Pilgrims Towards a Better World, which is set to be released on Tuesday. Among the excerpts published Tuesday were quotes attributed to the Vatican pontiff in which he is said to have cited claims by 'some experts' accusing Israel of genocide, and backing an investigation of IDF war conduct. 'According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,' Pope Francis is quoted as saying. 'We should investigate carefully to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.' Pope Francis has already publicly castigated Israel's war against Hamas and Hezbollah, calling the IDF's actions 'excessive' and 'immoral.' 'Defense must always be proportionate to the attack,' the pope told reporters on September 29th. 'When there is something disproportionate, one shows a tendency to dominate which goes beyond what is moral,' he continued. Even operations which are essentially defensive can be 'immoral actions' if they are 'excessive,' Pope Francis argued. Later on Sunday, the Combat Antisemitism Movement slammed Pope Francis' remarks, comparing it to the historic 'Inquisitions.' 'The State of Israel is currently facing a war of intended annihilation on seven fronts, and these remarks look like a possible opening of an eighth front, from of all places, the Vatican, which can also lead to the spilling of Jewish blood around the world,' said CAM CEO Sacha Roytman Dratwa. 'For a Pope who appears to prize even-handedness and peace, we see that the Jewish State once again appears to be the exception.' 'We had hoped after Nostra Aetate in 1965 that the Jewish People would be seen as equal to all others around the world by the Catholic hierarchy, but these claims suggest otherwise, and out of all the conflicts and real genocides around the world, the national homeland of the Jewish people is once again singled out as a target for opprobrium.' 'The Catholic Church has a very troubling history of investigations into the conduct of Jews, which were frequently called Inquisitions,' continued Roytman Dratwa. 'It would behoove Pope Francis to choose his words more carefully because they bring to mind a horrific and bloody history of Catholic religious leaders attacking Jews for the enjoyment of others in public at tribunals and Inquisitions where the Jew would always be found guilty regardless of the facts.'

Canadian organization walks back plans to hold memorial vigil in honor of Yahya Sinwar, the late Hamas leader and mastermind behind the October 7th massacres. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A far-left Canadian organization has nixed plans to hold a public event honoring the late chief of the Hamas terror organization and mastermind behind the October 7th massacres, after a public backlash against the gathering. On Saturday, the Canadian Defenders of Human Rights (CD4HR) issued a statement announcing that it has canceled the planned November 26th memorial vigil in the Toronto-area city of Mississauga honoring Yahya Sinwar. 'CD4HR has decided to cancel the November 26 Vigil for the Great Martyr Yahya Sinwar, our Mandela, due to several reasons - primarily the security and safety of our city Mississauga.' The group added, however, that it had not been 'intimidated' into cancelling the planned event. 'CD4HR has consulted the city of Mississauga and we have been assured that we can practice our Charter on Rights and Freedoms and we'll keep you posted on the next event.' 'Lest the Pro-Israel lobbies and their supporters think they intimidated us in any way. Freedom for Palestine.' Earlier this month, flyers advertising the planned gathering spark a row in Mississauga, after residents objected to the holding of a public memorial at city hall's Celebration Square. Mayor Carolyn Parrish came under fire after she refused to bar organizers from using the public square for the vigil, defending the event on the grounds of free speech. Later, Parrish appeared to suggest that the ads were part of an elaborate hoax. 'Consulted a network of Muslim organizations, serious partners in many activities of our city – coaching sports, walkathons for Trillium Hospital and diabetes. I asked them to track down the anonymous notice for a vigil at City Hall. No organization exists. No vigil is planned,' the mayor tweeted. Parrish later defended the planned vigil during a city council meeting last Wednesday, downplaying Sinwar's terrorist activities and comparing him to Nelson Mandela. 'I just want to point out — and I’m not being facetious — Nelson Mandela was declared a terrorist by the United States of America until the year 2008. Your terrorist and somebody else’s terrorist may be two different things,' Parrish said according to a report by The National Post.

‘Greatest merit in the world’ – IDF reservist Idan Keinan killed ...	Keinan had written his grandmother just two months ago that it would be 'the greatest merit in the world' to die for his country. Sgt. Maj. (res.) Idan Keinan was killed Saturday in the northern Gaza Strip by a sniper, the IDF announced Sunday after informing his family. According to Channel 14 military affairs reporter Noam Amir, the actions of the sniper were typical of how Hamas operates now in Gaza. 'We’re simply talking about a terrorist, a mouse who lives underground, comes out of his tunnel, shoots, and flees,' he noted on the Yisrael Haboker (Israel This Morning) show. 'This is basically now the reality,' he said, as 'Hamas has stopped existing as a military organization in the Strip and the terrorists are mainly operating as small guerrilla units who are sent out to commit sporadic terror attacks.' The 21-year-old from Ramat Gan was part of the Nachshon Battalion in the Kfir Brigade, operating in Beit Lahia on the outskirts of the major town of Jabalia that has been the focus of the IDF’s attention in recent weeks, with over a thousand Hamas terrorists captured and another thousand killed, according to the IDF. He is survived by his parents, a brother and a sister, Linoy, who wrote in a social media post that Keinan had 'died as a hero,' but that she 'will never manage to get over a loss such as you.' 'I can’t believe that you left me like that and went to Heaven, my beloved brother,' she wrote, describing him as 'the most good-hearted boy in the world' and asking him to 'protect us from above.' She also posted a letter that her brother had written to his grandmother two months ago about his strong feelings for his country and people. After talking of two soldiers who had recently been killed in action, he noted that they died 'for the country and we all know it&#8230;and are happy to be here instead of the civilians and the country that we so love.' 'Know that no matter what happens I &#8230; know exactly what I’m doing and where I am,' he wrote in part. 'I know what the risks are and what can happen and I am at peace with it. Moreover, this is the path that I have chosen and this is the path that I believe every man in the country should choose. There aren’t – and never will be – anyone else to protect us but us.' 'If our Father in Heaven decides that someone needs to die for our people, it’s the greatest merit in the world,' he added. Keinan had posted to Instagram last October 7 when Hamas invaded Israel, slaughtering 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, triggering his call-up, that 'No one here will sleep until you [all] feel safe, I promise you.' Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shama Cohen, called the fallen soldier 'an angel and brave sharpshooter' who was 'suffused with love of country and the Jewish people&#8230;. We in the municipality will do all we can to hug and strengthen the precious family.'

The Syrian journalist promoting peace with Israel	Hayvi Bouzo works from the U.S., knowing she is considered a traitor by many in her home country. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hayvi Bouzo is a Syrian journalist trying to promote peace between Israel and the Arab world by using her online platform, which is based in the U.S. because her views make her a traitor in the eyes of many in her home country. The atrocities Hamas-led terrorists committed during their invasion of Israel last October 7 galvanized her to bring the Israeli side of the war to over three quarters of a million followers who watch her weekly podcasts on Yalla, a show she cofounded to 'counteract the deep-seated rhetoric that incites violence, antisemitism, and hatred' in the Middle East, as she told The Jerusalem Post in a March interview. Bouzo has interviewed many Israelis so far who lost relatives on October 7 as well as family members of hostages, such as Thomas Hand, the father of a nine-year-old, Emily, who spent some eight weeks in Hamas captivity before being freed among dozens of women and children in the only hostage deal to date, last November. 'I had to be composed with him during the broadcast,' she told Ynet in an interview published Saturday. 'It's not an Israeli audience that identifies with this terrible story. My job is to use the force of the story to convince my audience. They can hit me with thousands of horrific stories on the Palestinian side, but I know that my audience is also shocked by [these] stories.' What comes across in the interview is that Bouzo feels a sense of mission. 'There are hundreds of TV channels in the Arab world, none of which present the Israeli side. There’s no mention of the hostages or their families,' she noted. The story that most affected her, she said, was that of the kidnapping of Shiri and Yarden Bibas and their four-year-old Ariel and nine-month old, Kfir, the youngest hostages still in captivity. It is not known if any of them are still alive, and Bouzo said she 'cried through the whole interview' with their cousin, Yifat Ziller. 'I thought of my own two children, Gino (11) and Talia (8),' she said. 'I told my husband Hans that I couldn’t imagine how I’d keep it together if a disaster as horrific as that ever happened to us.' She has received venomous messages in reaction to such podcasts, she said, but feels relatively safe in the U.S., while saying, 'I live under the illusion that they don’t know exactly where I live or where my studio is.' She knows she would have been dead 'long ago' had she stayed in her home country. She and her family fled in 2012 after they received death threats following a Facebook post she wrote about a 'horrific massacre' the regime carried out towards the beginning of the civil war in Syria, which 'started off with arresting children and carried on to chopping off hands and feet during interrogations,' she said. In terms of Israel’s ongoing war, she expressed great satisfaction with how the Israelis have decimated Hezbollah, considering the amount of 'blood on their hands' they have of citizens not only of Israel but also Lebanon and her own country as well, she said. 'I’m glad that you’re setting Lebanon ablaze to get rid of Hezbollah,' she said. She believes the fight against Hamas is also just, framing it as a battle against terrorism that has affected Palestinians in Gaza no less than Jews in Israel. 'Assassinating a creature as evil as [Hamas head Yahya] Sinwar is an important step toward freeing the world of the threat of terrorism,' she said. 'His bloody regime has caused the deaths of so many Israelis, and he’s also killed Palestinians - innocent people. 'His assassination conveys a message to anyone seeking to disseminate terror,' she continued. 'The regime in Tehran is shaking in its boots and any terrorist organization is feeling the pressure right now. Sinwar’s assassination is a victory for justice and brings the world one step closer to a safer and freer world.' Bouzo also believes that most Palestinians want peace with Israel but that 'the initiative has to come from the Israeli side - talking about peace with the Palestinians and taking steps toward peace – because you’re the strong side.' She is trying to do her part on her show, she said in her March interview. 'By bringing attention to shared histories and modern realities, Yalla fosters empathy and dialogue, striving for a future where humanization and mutual respect prevail between Israel and its Arab neighbors and amongst Jewish and Muslim communities worldwide,' she said.

Iran taps replacement for ailing Ayatollah Khamenei – report	Tehran's top clerics reportedly choose a new supreme leader to replace the ailing Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who may be supplanted even before his death. By World Israel News Staff Tehran's top Islamic clerics are preparing to replace Iran's octogenarian supreme leader, according to a report published over the weekend. The report was released by Iran International, a Britain-based, Saudi-backed dissident Farsi satellite television network, and claims that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the 85-year-old supreme leader of the Islamic republic who has ruled since 1989, is suffering from a medical condition which is increasingly impairing his ability to lead the country. As such, the 60-member Assembly of Experts, a council of Tehran's top state Shi'ite clerics, met on September 26th at the behest of Khamenei to select his successor, the report claimed. After extensive debate and arduous deliberations, the Assembly of Experts ultimately voted unanimously to designate Khamenei's son, 55-year-old Mojtaba Khamenei, as the country's next spiritual leader. A theology instructor for the Qom Seminary - Iran's largest hawza, or theological school - Mojtaba is considered to be a hardline Islamist radical. Motjaba backed then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and is believed to have a strong influence on his father's politics. According to the report, Mojtaba may succeed his father even prior to his death, given Khamenei's reportedly deteriorating physical condition and diminishing capabilities. Khamenei himself has reportedly groom Mojtaba to replace him during his own lifetime, and is said to be considering stepping down to pave the way for the transition of power. Last week, Iran International reported that a major political scandal in Iran - centered around revelations of high-level corruption involving dozens of senior officials - was part of a larger effort orchestrated by Mojtaba and his allies to weaken potential rivals and secure his bid to succeed his father. Former lawmaker Abbas Palizdar, who gave a nearly three-hour interview on a massive, 54,000-page document regarding a string of corruption probes, used the scandal as an opportunity to endorse Mojtaba, saying his leadership would bring Iran to the kinds of 'fundamental reforms' the country's political echelon needs.

Latin American leaders back Israel in conflict against Iran, Hama...	Leaders from 19 Latin American countries sign declaration backing Israel's right to self-defense against Iran and its terrorist proxies including Hamas and Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff At the Combat Antisemitism Movement’s (CAM) fourth annual 2024 Latin American Forum Against Antisemitism, leaders from 19 Latin American countries signed a joint declaration affirming solidarity with the State of Israel and firmly backing its right to self-defense against the Iranian regime and its regional terrorist proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. The declaration further demanded that 'the Iranian regime be held accountable for its global terrorist activities, both past and present.' The four-day forum, held from November 11-14 in San José, Costa Rica, in partnership with the World Zionist Organization (WZO), convened high-profile government officials, diplomats, and regional leaders from across the Americas to establish a unified regional response to threats against Israel and antisemitism through collaborative action and a comprehensive joint declaration. 'The forum sent a resounding message of regional solidarity and allyship with the Jewish people and State of Israel during a time of unprecedented levels of antisemitism worldwide and rising threats from the Tehran regime and its terrorist proxies, including in Latin America, where Jewish communities have already been victimized by Iranian aggression in the past,' said CEO of the CAM Sacha Roytman Dratwa. 'No region of the world is immune to the proliferation of antisemitism, and CAM’s regional strategy, with offices across North and South America, as well as Europe and the Middle East, enables us to identify and respond to manifestations of antisemitism wherever they appear and offer locally tailored solutions.' Following last year's gathering in Uruguay, this year's forum, drawing participants from 19 countries, featured groundbreaking discussions on pressing challenges facing Jewish communities throughout Latin America, including the rise of global antisemitism following the October 7th attack on Israel and the growing threat of Iran and its terrorist proxies. The joint declaration, signed by participating nations and organizations, establishes concrete commitments to combat antisemitism across Latin America. It calls for implementing zero-hate policies, adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition of Antisemitism, developing educational initiatives, and demanding accountability for terrorist activities in the region, including the 1994 AMIA Jewish community center bombing in Buenos Aires. 'This forum represents a crucial step forward in uniting Latin American nations against rising antisemitism,' said Shay Salamon, Director of Hispanic Affairs of CAM. 'The breadth of participation and depth of commitment demonstrated here shows that Latin America stands ready to act together against hatred and discrimination.' 'Latin America has a crucial role to play in the global fight against antisemitism,' said Aaron Keyak, U.S. Deputy Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. 'The strong participation and concrete commitments made at this forum demonstrate that regional leaders understand the urgency of this moment and are ready to take meaningful action to protect their Jewish communities and combat hatred in all its forms.' Among the forum's most notable moments was the presentation of new research findings on antisemitism in Latin America since October 7th, alongside a moving Kristallnacht commemoration ceremony. The gathering also featured expert panels examining the evolution of antisemitism from the Holocaust to contemporary challenges, as well as strategic discussions on implementing practical measures to combat antisemitism across the region. The speakers included Aaron Keyak, U.S. Deputy Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism; Michal Gur-Aryeh, Ambassador of Israel to Costa Rica; and renowned Catalan journalist and Chair of the CAM Advisory Board for Latin America Pilar Rahola. The gathering received support from Costa Rica’s national leadership, including Vice President Stephan Brunner, Minister of Foreign Trade Manuel Tovar, Minister of Culture Jorge Rodriguez Vives, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Lydia Maria Peralta Cordero, demonstrating strong host country commitment to CAM's initiatives. The forum also welcomed the attendance of key regional figures including Judge Nancy Hernandez, President of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and Fernando Lottenberg, Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism of the Organization of American States (OAS). Forum participants met at Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly with 15 Latin American lawmakers who presented initiatives they were promoting to combat antisemitism and hate speech. The forum concluded with participating nations and organizations pledging to strengthen cooperation in fighting antisemitism and promoting education about Jewish history and culture throughout Latin America.

3 arrested for firing flares, sparking fire at Netanyahu’s home	Senior military officer in the reserves is among those expected to face charges for arson, explosive use. By World Israel News Staff Three anti-government protesters were arrested after they fired multiple flares at the private home of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Caesarea on Saturday evening. One of those arrested is a senior military officer in the reserves, according to Hebrew-language media reports. In a statement, the Shin Bet internal security agency identified the officer as a prominent 'leader' of the weekly protests in front of Netanyahu's residence. Security footage from the scene showed one of the flares crashing to the ground on Netanyahu's property, sparking a fire. The Netanyahu family was not home at the time of the incident, and no one was injured. The three suspects are expected to expect criminal charges including arson with the intent to harm, intentional damage with explosive material, and illegal release of explosive material. בלעדי: אירוע הזיקוק בקיסריה סמוך לבית ראש הממשלה. בתיעוד הזה שמתפרסם כאן לראשונה ניתן לראות שני זיקוקים ימיים שנורו לשמים בשעה שבע וחצי בערב מאיזור הדיונה היכן שמתקיימות ההפגנות מול בית ראש הממשלה בקיסריה. הדיונה חסומה בגדר ומרוחקת מהבית ומהרחוב שנמצא בצד השני. כפי שרואים בסרטון… pic.twitter.com/OTtU0P6B7h &mdash; בר שם-אור Bar Shem-Ur (@Bar_ShemUr) November 16, 2024 Attorney Gonen Ben Itzhak, who has long been a leader in the anti-government movement, claimed that the severity of the incident was exaggerated and that those arrested are political prisoners. 'This is a minor incident that is being overblown,' Ben Itzhak said on his X account. He then claimed that the arrests were part of a 'witch hunt' targeting those who had only 'fired flares in the air.' Notably, Ben Itzhak did not acknowledge that the flares had started a blaze on Netanyahu's property, nor did he state that firing flares at the premier's home was wrong. 'Good morning to the Bibi-stan dictatorship,' he added, using the prime minister's nickname. An organization advocating for anti-government protesters who are arrested decried the Shin Bet's involvement in the investigation into the incident. 'No one should be surprised that the current regime is dragging prominent protest activists to Shin Bet investigations,' the Arrestee's Support Network said in a statement. 'This is a protest event in which normal pyrotechnics were used and the claims that the Prime Minister's house or anyone from the Prime Minister's surroundings were some kind of target are a crazy and ugly blood libel,' the organization claimed. According to Hebrew-language reports, it's believed that the flares were fired from sand dunes on the beach behind Netanyahu's house - rather than from the protest in front of the home.

Iran, Hezbollah strongholds make Syria a ‘hunting ground’ for Isr...	Syria’s current status as a geographical description rather than a country looks set to remain for the foreseeable future. By Jonathan Spyer, Middle East Forum With Israeli forces in daily action in Gaza and south Lebanon, and intermittent drone and missile attacks continuing from Iraq and Yemen, one front in the regional conflict currently underway has tended to be ignored: Syria. Yet the available evidence shows that Israeli strikes against Lebanese Hezbollah and Iranian targets in Syria have increased significantly over the last two months. The individuals targeted in Syria have included veteran and prominent leaders and operatives of the Iran-led regional axis. At the same time, reports in regional media have appeared in recent weeks portraying Syrian President Bashar Assad as a weak link in the Iranian-led war effort. These reports suggest that the Syrian leader is trying to distance himself from his Iranian ally and move closer to moderate Arab states. Some Israeli Syria-watchers concur with this assessment. So what is going on in Israel’s most significant northern neighbor, and where may things be headed? It is important to remember that the civil war that began in Syria in 2012 has not concluded. Rather, the fighting lines have become frozen, leading to a de facto partition of the country. After a sorting-out period, Syria has since 2019 been divided into three de facto entities: the regime-controlled area, encompassing around 60% of the country’s territory including Damascus and the entire coastal area; the area controlled by the Kurdish-dominated Autonomous Administration of North-East Syria (AANES), which comprises around 30% of Syria; and a Turkish-guaranteed Sunni Islamist enclave in the northwest, holding 10% of the country’s territory. The continuation of this arrangement depends on the willingness of international players to underwrite these areas of control: regime Syria is today a protectorate of Iran and Russia, the US guarantees the survival of the Kurdish-dominated area, and Turkey is the sponsor and controller of the Sunni Islamist area. Assad does not enjoy undisputed territorial control even over the area nominally under his rule. His army is weak and impoverished. As a result, the patrons are today the senior partners. In practice, this means that the Iranians and their militia proxies are today in control of the southeastern border crossing between Iraq and Syria at Albukamal, and the roads leading westward. Assad’s army enters this area only with Iranian permission. Southern Syria is thus a link in the chain of contiguous Iranian control stretching from Iran across Iraq and Syria to Lebanon and the Mediterranean. Israel professes no particular interest in Assad either way, except insofar as his forces seek to facilitate, assist, or defend the Iranian weapons trail from Iraq to Hezbollah-controlled Lebanon. Israel’s interest Israel has, however, an intense interest in Iran’s activities on Syrian soil, and in disrupting the Iranian effort. In recent weeks, this interest has been reflected in some very major 'Resistance Axis' scalps apparently claimed by Israeli air power on Syrian soil. The names on this list may not quite have the prominence of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah or Hamas’s Ismail Haniyeh. But they are significant players, whose sudden absence will contribute significantly to the disarray currently apparent in this regional camp. The list includes Ali Musa Daqduq, a veteran Lebanese Hezbollah operator whose name is well-known to Americans who served in Iraq. In the years of Shi’ite insurgency against US and allied forces in that country, Daqduq was a key facilitator and point man for the Iranians. He is believed by the US to have taken part in deadly attacks on US troops. According to Syrian media reports, Daqduq was killed in an Israeli airstrike on the Sayida Zeinab neighborhood of Damascus on November 12. An Israeli airstrike in the Qusayr area this week took out a second very senior Lebanese Hezbollah operator. Qusayr, in the Syria-Lebanon border area, is a strategically important area for Iran’s arms trail into Lebanon. It was the site of a fierce battle in the Syrian civil war in which Hezbollah prevailed over the Syrian rebels. This week, an Israeli air strike on a location in that area killed Salim Ayyash, the Hezbollah man convicted in absentia for the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al Hariri in 2005. Several additional notable movement figures have also been eliminated in Syria in recent weeks: Mahmoud Shahin, who headed Hezbollah’s intelligence network in Syria and was involved in its air defense efforts, was assassinated on November 4. Abu Saleh, who headed Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, responsible for overseeing the financing of Hezbollah from Iranian oil sales, was killed in a precision strike on October 22 in Damascus. Adham Jahut, a Hezbollah official based in the Quneitra area and responsible for the organization’s intelligence activities in this important location, was killed by an Israeli air strike on October 10. Hassan Jaafar Qassir, brother-in-law of deceased Hezbollah leader Nasrallah, was killed in Damascus on October 3. The disarray of Hezbollah This list reflects both the extent of Israeli intelligence penetration of Syria and Hezbollah, and the extent to which Israel has, since the outbreak of war a year ago, brushed aside former tacit rules of engagement, treating Syria as an inseparable component of an alliance with which Jerusalem is now at war. The recent assassinations also show the relative disarray of Hezbollah and its allies in the face of Israel’s relentless attentions. This jibes with reports from other sources, according to which Hezbollah officials and their families have arrived in Iraq in considerable numbers in recent weeks. There, they are being housed, with the assistance of their comrades in the Iraqi Shi’ite militias, in the Shi’ite holy cities of Najaf and Karbala. Only there, it appears, do they feel safe from Israel. Some observers have suggested that the current relative disarray of the 'Resistance Axis' is leading to efforts by the Syrian leader to extricate himself from it. An article in the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed newspaper this week assembled the evidence. It noted a recent reduction in Captagon smuggling into Jordan, in line with Jordanian and Emirati requests. Also, Saudi Arabia’s decision to reopen its Damascus embassy reflects an undoubted desire among pro-Western Gulf states to draw a line under the civil war and use economic inducements to tempt Assad away from his allies. Behind-the-scenes efforts, led by the Italians, are underway to restore relations between the regime and Europe. But any hopes that Assad might make a decisive break with Iran should probably be resisted. The Syrian dictator remains in debt to Tehran for his surviving the civil war. He must surely be acutely aware that had he met the Arab Spring while aligned with the West, he would almost certainly have shared the fate of fellow authoritarian leaders Zine el Abidine Bin-Ali of Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Also, the current Syrian regime has survived for half a century because it exploited conflict with Israel and the West (while leaving the door slightly open for some future rapprochement). Gulf and Western overtures enable Syria to continue to act according to this pattern. A wholesale abandonment of the Iranians would represent a severe break with a model that has served the Assad family rather well. So any such break remains unlikely. Syria’s current status as a geographical description rather than a country looks set to remain for the foreseeable future. This means that it is likely also to continue to be a hunting ground for Israeli air power working its way down the long list of Hezbollah and Iranian targets in the country.

New ICC judge’s past raises red flags in ‘war crimes’ case agains...	This request may further delay the panel’s decision on whether to indict Netanyahu and Gallant for their alleged 'criminal responsibility for…war crimes and crimes against humanity.' By Jewish Breaking News Israel is questioning the impartiality of one of the three judges probing whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant should be arrested for war crimes by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Slovenian judge Beti Hohler was appointed three weeks ago following the resignation of the presiding judge, Romanian justice Iulia Motoc, for health reasons. According to Reuters, a statement was sent to the court by Israel’s Attorney General’s office asking for Hohler to 'provide information to clarify whether there are (or are not) grounds to reasonably doubt her impartiality,' considering that her previous position had been to serve as an attorney in the ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor (OTP). 'Israel does not suggest that judge Hohler’s previous employment with the OTP necessarily or automatically gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of a lack of impartiality,' the statement said. 'However, judges of this Court have acknowledged that previous duties within the OTP may, depending on the circumstances, give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.' This request may further delay the panel’s decision on whether to indict Netanyahu and Gallant for their alleged 'criminal responsibility for…war crimes and crimes against humanity' in the Gaza Strip during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The request for an arrest warrant, made in May by ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, also included three Hamas heads for their leading roles in the invasion of Israel last October 7, in which Hamas-led terrorists massacred 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, 97 of whom, both dead and alive, are still in captivity. Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh and Mohammed Deif have since been killed by Israel, although Haniyeh’s death in Tehran was not officially acknowledged as an Israeli hit job. Israel, along with several of its allies and legal organizations, had previously submitted official challenges to the warrant. These outlined the ICC’s 'manifest lack of jurisdiction' in the case and charged that the court was violating its own statutes by 'failing to provide Israel with the opportunity to exercise its right to investigate by itself the claims raised by the Prosecutor, before proceeding,' the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in its accompanying statement in September. 'No other democracy with an independent and respected legal system like that which exists in Israel has been treated in this prejudicial manner by the Prosecutor,' the Ministry added. Khan, who had asked that the judges make a quick decision when presenting the arrest request, has since become the subject of an external investigation due to complaints by a former underling that he had made many improper and unwanted sexual advances to her while she worked in his office.

FBI arrests ISIS supporter plotting Houston terrorist attack	A search of Said's personal devices revealed pro-ISIS images and messages, including communication with the official media outlet for ISIS. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon The FBI arrested Houston resident Anas Said for planning a terror attack on U.S. soil and supporting ISIS terrorists, officials announced on Thursday. The 28-year-old, who was taken into federal custody last week, admitted to providing material support to ISIS, investigating how to execute an attack on local military recruiting centers, and boasting that he would commit a '9/11-style' attack if he had the necessary resources. He also admitted to creating ISIS propaganda and offering his home as a refuge to ISIS members. Said was coordinating the foiled attack from his far west Houston apartment, according to the FBI. A search of Said's personal devices revealed pro-ISIS images and messages, including communication with the official media outlet for ISIS. Said has been charged with creating at least five videos and two images that were sent to an ISIS social media and web designer for publication. 'Today is a great day. We’ve taken a suspected terrorist off the streets of Houston,' Douglas Williams, special agent in charge of FBI Houston, said of the arrest in a Thursday morning news conference.

Waves of Israeli airstrikes pound Beirut’s Dahieh district for se...	According to the army, there were three waves of strikes on Saturday — and seven since Friday morning. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli Air Force struck 20 Hezbollah targets in Beirut’s Dahieh district in waves of attacks, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Saturday evening. 'All of the targets attacked were deliberately placed by Hezbollah in the heart of the civilian population. This is another example of the Hezbollah terrorist organization’s cynical use of Lebanese citizens as human shields,' the IDF said. According to the army, there were three waves of strikes on Saturday — and seven since Friday morning. The IDF said residents were warned to leave the area ahead of time and precise munitions were used to mitigate civilian damage. Also on Saturday, Hezbollah launched at least 65 rockets and drones at Israel. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014. בפעם השלישית היום והשביעית מאתמול בבוקר: צה״ל השלים גל תקיפות על מפקדות חיזבאללה בדאחייה. בהכוונת אגף המודיעין, מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר השלימו לפני זמן קצר גל תקיפות נוסף על מפקדות צבאיות של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה במרחב הדאחייה שבביירות >> pic.twitter.com/9Y3U645ceB — צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 16, 2024 The post Waves of Israeli airstrikes pound Beirut’s Dahieh district for second day appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/waves-of-israeli-airstrikes-pound-beiruts-dahieh-district-for-second-day/	2024-11-16T17:04:56-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IAF-fighter-jets.jpg
USAID announces $230 million in Palestinian aid, adding to $190 m...	USAID states the new funding will 'support economic recovery and development programs in the West Bank and Gaza.' By JNS The U.S. Agency for International Development, an independent federal agency, announced last week that it is giving another $230 million in aid to the Palestinian people, after having said over the summer that it was giving $190 million to the Palestinians. JNS sought comment from USAID, which first posted the news last week but dated the release Nov. 17. USAID initially indicated that it would return a call from JNS on Friday but did not do so. It now dates its release Nov. 15. 'A significant chunk of this money, indirectly if not directly, funds Hamas,' wrote Michael Doran, a senior fellow and director of the Hudson Institute’s Center for Peace and Security in the Middle East. USAID states that the new funding will 'support economic recovery and development programs in the West Bank and Gaza.' (The Biden administration and some others refer to Judea and Samaria as the 'West Bank.') 'This significant investment highlights USAID’s commitment to improving the lives of individuals and communities in the region amidst challenging conditions,' the agency stated. It noted that it has 'invested' more than $600 million 'in economic support funding of the Palestinian people, in addition to the over $2.1 billion in humanitarian assistance since Oct. 7, 2023.' 'Our commitment to the Palestinian people remains steadfast,' stated Amy Tohill-Stull, the West Bank and Gaza mission director at USAID. 'This funding demonstrates our resolve to support sustainable development and provide essential services that enhance the quality of life for all Palestinians and further reduce the influence of Hamas.' The funding 'aims to promote resilience among Palestinian communities, and will support a range of programmatic areas, including private sector and civil society strengthening, youth empowerment and education and community level priorities,' USAID said. 'New initiatives focus on health recovery efforts in Gaza, trade and investment, improvements in water and wastewater access and management, construction of new youth centers and safe spaces, capacity building support for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network and strengthening of municipalities to deliver more effective, accountable governance.' It added that it 'reaffirms its long-standing partnership with the Palestinian people and its dedication to providing essential support during these trying times' and 'remains committed to a peaceful and prosperous future for all in the region.'

Saudi Arabia’s anti-Israel rhetoric and Iran rapprochement raises...	Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler accused the Israeli military of committing collective genocide in Gaza. By Debbie Weiss, The Algemeiner Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler accused the Israeli military of committing 'collective genocide' in Gaza while also pressing Israel to respect Iranian sovereignty, amid reports that Tehran has postponed its planned attack on the Jewish state. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s remarks, made in Riyadh on Monday during a summit of leaders of Islamic nations, underscored the evolving rapprochement between the erstwhile archenemies Iran and Saudi Arabia. The crown prince, also known by his initials MBS, urged the international community to demand that Israel 'respect the sovereignty of the sisterly Islamic Republic of Iran and not to violate its lands.' The two regional heavyweights restored relations last year after decades of animosity. MBS’s anti-Israel rhetoric came days after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. For Israel, the statement from Riyadh may signal a setback to the normalization process with Saudi Arabia, a long-sought goal within the framework of the Abraham Accords, brokered by Trump during his first term in the White House, that has seen Israel establish formal ties with several Arab states in recent years. According to a Sky News Arabia report published two days later and citing Iranian officials, Tehran has shelved a planned third direct strike on Israel, with the delay attributed to possible forthcoming diplomatic talks with Trump. Israel Hayom published a similar report the following day, citing officials in Jerusalem familiar with the matter. Iranian First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref expressed his hope that the incoming Trump administration would put a stop to Israel’s campaigns against its terrorist proxies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'The American government is the main supporter of the actions of the Zionist regime [Israel], and the world is waiting for the promise of the new government of this country to immediately stop the war against the innocent people of Gaza and Lebanon,' Aref said at Monday’s gathering. Observers noted that Saudi Arabia’s shift could stem from both domestic and regional considerations. For the kingdom, improving relations with Iran is a strategic move to de-escalate conflicts in Yemen, where both countries have backed opposing sides. By opening diplomatic channels with Iran, Saudi Arabia also aims to reduce its dependence on Western security guarantees amid growing regional autonomy. According to Dr. Eyal Pinko, a Middle East expert who served in Israeli intelligence for more than three decades, Saudi Arabia is also under pressure from France, a major arms supplier, to maintain a moderate stance and promote regional peace. 'Saudi Arabia understands [it] cannot rely on the Americans' for arms, Pinko told The Algemeiner. For its part, Iran may be seeking closer ties with the Gulf kingdom as a result of recent Israeli operations that have decimated the senior leadership of Hezbollah, Iran’s most influential proxy in the Arab world that has long served as a strategic partner. 'Iran is spreading its bets all around, not to be on one side or another,' Pinko said. Hezbollah, along with Hamas in Gaza, had in the past been blacklisted as terrorist groups by Riyadh. The New York Times last month cited a Saudi tycoon with ties to the monarchy as saying that the war in Gaza has 'set back any Israeli integration into the region.' 'Saudi Arabia sees that any association with Israel has become more toxic since Gaza,' Ali Shihabi told the newspaper. In another blow for Saudi-Israel relations, Riyadh announced it would revoke the license of the Saudi news broadcaster, MBC, after it labeled the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar a terrorist. But according to Pinko, the chance of Saudi-Israel normalization is not entirely lost, pending a ceasefire. 'If nothing extreme happens with Iran until Jan. 20 [when Trump takes office], I believe that the Abraham Accords will come back to the table,' he said.

Israel eliminated secret Iran nuclear site	The clandestine site held sophisticated equipment used for testing explosives needed to detonate nuclear devices. By JNS The Israeli airstrikes on Iran last month destroyed a secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin, 19 miles southeast of Tehran, Axios reported on Friday. The clandestine site held sophisticated equipment used for testing explosives needed to detonate nuclear devices, the report read, citing three U.S. officials, one current Israeli official and one former Israeli official. The Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security acquired high-resolution satellite imagery of the facility, which showed that it was completely destroyed in Israel’s Oct. 26 attack. Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies began noticing activity in the Taleghan 2 facility in the Parchin military complex in early 2024, which had been largely inactive since 2003, when the Islamic Republic froze its military nuclear program, according to Axios. One unnamed U.S. official quoted in the report said: '[The Iranians] conducted scientific activity that could lay the ground for the production of a nuclear weapon. It was a top secret thing. A small part of the Iranian government knew about this, but most of the Iranian government didn’t.' Although President Joe Biden asked Jerusalem not to target Tehran’s nuclear facilities, the site in Parchin was chosen as a target because it was not part of Iran’s declared nuclear program. This placed the mullah regime in a position where admitting a hit to the site would expose its efforts to resume activity forbidden by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Moreover, 'The strike was a not so subtle message that the Israelis have significant insight into the Iranian system even when it comes to things that were kept top secret and known to a very small group of people in the Iranian government,' the report cited a U.S. official as saying. Last week, Rafael Grossi, the director of the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency, visited Iran for the first time since May. He is expected to meet with his agency’s board of governors in Vienna this week for a vote on a resolution to censure Tehran for its lack of cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. Speaking about the tensions between Israel and Iran, Grossi said during a news conference in Tehran on Thursday that the Islamic Republic’s 'nuclear installations should not be attacked.' Earlier in the week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz suggested that Iran’s nuclear facilities may be targeted. Iran is 'more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities. We have the opportunity to achieve our most important goal—to thwart and eliminate the existential threat to the State of Israel,' Katz said. Israel’s two assaults against Iran’s air defense system this year have left the country vulnerable to future attacks, with all four of Tehran’s Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile batteries destroyed, according to U.S. media. On April 19, Israel took out one of the S-300 systems in response to Tehran’s first-ever direct attack against the Jewish state. On Oct. 26, in response to a second Iranian attack, Israel targeted 20 sites in Iran, destroying the remaining three. 'The majority of Iran’s air defense was taken out,' a senior Israeli official told Fox News.

Israel’s National Library unveils rare photos of WWII Jewish hero...	The images displayed capture candid moments, such as Senesh on horseback at Kfar Baruch, playing table tennis, and working with cows at the Nahalal Agricultural School. By Jewish Breaking News The National Library of Israel has unveiled an extensive collection of photographs chronicling the life of a Jewish war heroine. Born in Budapest in 1921, Hannah Senesh received an Agfa Box-Spezial Camera at a young age, which became her constant companion. Her photographs span from her early life in Budapest through family vacations, and later document her pioneering days in British Mandatory Palestine. Senesh’s life took a dramatic turn in 1943 when she enlisted in the British army and volunteered for a dangerous paratrooper mission into Nazi-occupied Europe. She was tasked to assist downed Allied pilots in escaping and to aid Jewish communities under Nazi occupation. In March 1944, she parachuted into Slovenia with three fellow paratroopers. Tragically, on June 9, 1944, Hungarian police captured her in Budapest. Despite enduring months of torture and the arrest of her mother, Senesh refused to divulge information to her captors. She was ultimately charged with spying and treason, leading to her execution on November 7, 1944, at just 23 years old. In 1945, Jewish Brigade soldier Moshe Braslavsky discovered a suitcase under her bed at Kibbutz Sdot Yam containing letters, diaries, and photo albums. Later, a notebook of poetry, entrusted to a friend before her final mission, emerged to further cement her cultural impact. In recognition of her sacrifice, Senesh was reinterred in 1950 at Israel’s national military cemetery on Mt. Herzl in Jerusalem. The archive contains a treasure trove of her personal effects, including manuscripts, notebooks, photographs, documents, and personal items. In her own words, preserved in letters to her mother, Senesh humorously noted, 'Everyone wants me to photograph them, as if they’ve appointed me the court photographer.' Her photographic legacy includes carefully curated albums with typewritten captions and personal annotations on the backs of photos, many of which were sent to her family in Hungary. The images displayed capture candid moments, such as Senesh on horseback at Kfar Baruch, playing table tennis, and working with cows at the Nahalal Agricultural School.

Trump taps RFK Jr. to lead Dept. of Health and Human Services	Shortly before the election, Trump had assured him that, if elected, he would let the longtime vaccine skeptic 'go wild on health.' By Andrew Lapin, JTA Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the anti-vaccine questioner and onetime presidential candidate, is President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump announced his pick for the Cabinet position on Truth Social, his social network, on Thursday afternoon, saying he was 'thrilled' to nominate Kennedy to lead the department. 'For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,' Trump wrote. 'Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!' The nomination cemented the unlikely alliance between Trump and the scion of Democratic Party royalty, who suspended his third-party campaign to endorse the Republican this summer. Shortly before the election, Trump had assured him that, if elected, he would let the longtime vaccine skeptic 'go wild on health.' In addition to his anti-vaccine views, Kennedy has also floated removing fluoride from drinking water. Among the areas that would be under Kennedy’s purview at the department: the Food and Drug Administration; Medicare and Medicaid; the National Institutes of Health; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; agencies dealing with substance abuse, mental health and toxic substances; and the office of U.S. Surgeon General. He is ardently pro-Israel and recently defended Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the late leader of the Chabad Hasidic movement, from attacks leveled by far-right commentator Candace Owens. Some prominent Jews have declared themselves in Kennedy’s corner. After Thursday’s nomination announcement, he gained another one: Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado. 'I’m excited by the news that the President-Elect will appoint Robert Kennedy Jr.,' Polis wrote on social media, saying Kennedy had 'helped us defeat vaccine mandates in Colorado in 2019.' Polis outlined several health-related policy positions he said he agreed with Kennedy on, including reforming federal nutrition standards, curbing pesticide usage and capping international drug prices. Polis concluded, 'He will face strong special interest opposition on these, but I look forward to partnering with him to truly make American healthy again and I hope that we can finally make progress on these important issues.'

Iran and Qatar have their fingerprints all over South Africa’s an...	Rumors about Iranian involvement in the ICJ case have been swirling for some time in South Africa. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Iran, Qatar, Hamas, and other terrorist entities are quietly underwriting South Africa's effort to prosecute Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a new report obtained by the Washington Free Beacon alleges. South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), brought its case against Israel on Dec. 29, 2023, just three months after Hamas's terror spree left more than 1,200 dead and hundreds more kidnapped. The suit alleges that Israel is committing mass genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip but offers little evidence to support this claim. Nevertheless, more than a dozen countries have joined the suit over the last year, elevating international pressure on Israel as the Jewish state fights to survive. The timing of the lawsuit is raising fresh questions about South Africa's motivation for bringing it, prompting an in-depth investigation by the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP), a nonprofit that studies global Jew-hatred. The report 'connects South Africa's political and financial alignment with Iran and Qatar—both leading supporters of global terrorism—with its campaign to bring a legal case against Israel,' ISGAP said in a draft press release. The African National Congress, ISGAP found, was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy before it received a mysterious cash infusion in early 2024—just days after it launched the ICJ case against Israel. The source of this cash, the report states, is believed to be Iran and its regional allies, including Qatar, which are using South Africa to launder baseless claims against Israel and ratchet up diplomatic pressure amid a brutal yearlong war. 'Crucially, this money appeared in the ANC's coffers without explanation, mere days after the South African government brought its case against Israel at the ICJ,' according to ISGAP's report. 'Given the lack of merit in South Africa's case, and the unlikely possibility that it was brought unilaterally by an unpopular and near-bankrupt ANC, a crucial question arises. Who is actually funding South Africa's case at the ICJ?' African National Congress leaders, including South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, have declined to disclose the source of this funding, which helped the party recover from nearly $30 million in debt. Putting a case before the ICJ requires deep pockets. Estimates place the preliminary costs at around $10.5 million, with a trial running as high as $79 million. 'Given the enormity of the cost, it is difficult to dismiss the argument that South Africa was the beneficiary of considerable external support,' according to ISGAP's report. In March, the Electoral Commission of South Africa opened an investigation into how the ANC settled its soaring debt. Rumors about Iranian involvement in the ICJ case have been swirling for some time in South Africa. Frans Cronje, a former CEO of the South African Institute of Race Relations, alleged in a January interview that Tehran enlisted its allies in the ANC to bring the lawsuit. 'The South Africans,' Cronje said, 'have for an extended period of time been fronting an Iranian strategy to do two things: The first is to so poison opinion against Israel in the Western world that military aid to Israel becomes increasingly conditional and, secondly, to so traumatize and stigmatize young Jews around the world that service in the [Israel Defense Forces] becomes increasingly controversial.' Evidence of Iran's role in the ICJ case is shown through the legal advisory team leading South Africa's lawsuit, which includes those 'affiliated with internationally recognized terrorist entities.' A network of pro-Palestinian activist groups sculpted the legal groundwork underpinning South Africa's suit, according to ISGAP's research. Those groups include Law for Palestine, a research organization that has worked alongside the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), and the U.S.-based Democracy for the Arab World Now, which has lobbied the American government to cut off arms shipments to Israel. 'This effective network of legal experts who are united in their attempts to delegitimize Israel in international legal forums played a key role in the submission of South Africa's ICJ case against Israel,' according to the report. One member of the South African legal team, Shawan Jabarin, also serves as the general director of Al-Haq, a Palestinian advocacy group that helps push economic boycotts on Israel as part of the global BDS movement. Jabarin is also reportedly linked to the PFLP terror group. Another member of the South African delegation, Raji Sourani, also maintains ties to the PFLP. He is the founder of the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, another group that wages lawfare against Israel. Sourani served a three-year prison sentence in Israel for being a PFLP member and was denied a U.S. entry visa in 2012. Two years later, Sourani attended a PFLP ceremony and stated, 'I was in the ranks of the Popular Front, and there were comrades who taught us with their own hands. … We don't apologize and don't regret our past, we are proud that once we were members of this organization and we fought in its ranks.' ISGAP found that out of 574 citations in South Africa's ICJ complaint, at least 45 can be traced back to 'overtly anti-Israel NGOs,' including Al-Haq and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights. Against this backdrop, the South African government has drawn closer to Iran and Qatar for years, lending credibility to claims that anti-Israel powers in the Middle East played a central role in the ICJ case. In late July, for instance, South African foreign minister Ronald Lamola traveled to Tehran to participate in the swearing-in ceremony for Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian. Lamole met there with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Bagheri, who praised Lamole's 'outstanding role as an undaunted and innovative diplomat in pursuing the case of the Zionist regime's crimes at the International Court of Justice.' Bagheri added that Iran 'fully supports South Africa's vital role in this regard.' It has become increasingly clear in recent years that Iran views South Africa 'as a hub for circumventing Western sanctions,' according to the report, which notes that Tehran 'has sought to acquire satellite interception, online surveillance, hacking, and missile guidance technologies from South Africa.' The African country also championed Iran's inclusion in the BRICS economic bloc, which has helped it keep access to international cash sources while facing American sanctions. Economic ties between South Africa and Qatar, an Iranian ally that has sheltered Hamas's leadership, have also been growing in recent years. Bilateral trade between South Africa and Qatar rose from around $307 million in 2012 to roughly $1 billion in 2022. Notably, 'it was Hamas's mediation between South Africa and Qatar that prompted them to strengthen their relations,' according to the report. Charles Asher Small, ISGAP's executive director, said his group's findings 'position South Africa as a key player in the global web of anti-democratic terror financing.' The ICJ case is part of a broader attempt by anti-Israel extremists 'to delegitimize Israel in order to destroy it and to undermine democracy and related institutions.'

Scientists harness electric fields to forecast extreme weather	The data revealed that different cloud types produced distinct electric field patterns, offering new clues about the structure and intensity of storms. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli researchers on Thursday unveiled a groundbreaking approach to predicting severe weather events by monitoring atmospheric electric fields. The ability to track electric field variations in real time could provide meteorologists with valuable early warnings for extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, flash floods, or intense storms, and inform long-term climate adaptation strategies. By studying the Negev Desert in southern Israel, an area known for its unpredictable climate, researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Reichmann University found that as these systems passed through, there were substantial increases in the Potential Gradient of the electric field, rising from typical fair-weather values of 100-200 volts per meter to several thousand volts per meter. The study, led by Dr. Roy Yaniv from the Institute of Earth Sciences at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in collaboration with Prof. Yoav Yair of Reichmann University, was recently published in the peer-reviewed Atmospheric Research journal. The study focused on 'wet' Cyprus Lows — a type of low-pressure weather system commonly associated with rainstorms in the Negev. Sharp spikes in the electric field coincided with the passage of convective clouds, which are often linked to intense rainfall. The data revealed that different cloud types produced distinct electric field patterns, offering new clues about the structure and intensity of storms. Additionally, the study also found that factors such as the electrical charge of rain droplets and cloud structure could significantly impact the electric field, further refining the ability to predict weather patterns. 'This research demonstrates how electric field variations can serve as indicators of shifting weather patterns, allowing us to anticipate severe weather events in real-time,' said Yaniv. 'The ability to identify these changes early is especially crucial in vulnerable regions like Israel, where even minor shifts in climate conditions can lead to major local impacts.' The ability to track electric field variations in real time could provide meteorologists with valuable early warnings for extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, flash floods, or intense storms. This could be especially useful in desert and semi-arid regions where traditional weather forecasting methods are less effective due to rapid changes in weather patterns. As climate change leads to more unpredictable and extreme weather patterns, monitoring electric fields could potentially help governments better understand shifting weather dynamics.

Pro-Hamas groups planting seeds of domestic terrorism in US, new ...	By flooding college campuses with agitprop and staging activities — protests or vandalisms — they hoped to manufacture an army of revolutionaries willing to adopt Hamas’s aims. By Dion J. Pierre, The Algemeiner Domestic terrorism may be the end game for the over 150 pro-Hamas groups operating on colleges campuses and elsewhere across the US to foster anti-Israel demonstrations, according to a new report by the Capital Research Center (CRC) think tank. 'The movement contains militant elements pushing it toward a wider, more severe campaign focused on property destruction and violence properly described as domestic terrorism,' researcher Ryan Mauro wrote in the report, titled 'Marching Toward Violence: The Domestic Anti-Israeli Protest Movement,' which was published last week. 'It demands the ‘dismantlement’ of America’s ‘colonialist,’ ‘imperialist,’ or ‘capitalist,’ system, often calling for the US to be abolished as a country.' He continued, 'These revolutionary goals are held by the two different factions of the anti-Israel extremist groups. The first faction combines Islamists, communists/Marxists, and anarchists. The second faction consists of groups with white supremacist/nationalist ideologies. They share Jew-hatred, anti-Americanism, and the goal of sparking a revolutionary uprising.' The group that is most responsible for the anti-Israel protest movement is Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), according to the report. Drawing on statements issued and actions taken by SJP and their collaborators, Mauro made the case that toolkits published by SJP herald Hamas for perpetrating mass casualties of civilians; SJP has endorsed Iran’s attacks on Israel as well as its stated intention to overturn the US-led world order; and other groups under its umbrella have called on followers to 'Bring the Intifada Home.' Such activities, the report explained, accelerated after Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel last Oct. 7, which pro-Hamas groups perceived as an inflection point in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and an opportunity. By flooding the internet and college campuses with agitprop and staging activities — protests or vandalisms — they hoped to manufacture a critical mass of youth support for their ideas, thus creating an army of revolutionaries willing to adopt Hamas’s aims as their own. The result has been a series of the kinds of incidents seen in academia during fall semester. Last month, when Jews around the world mourned on the anniversary of Oct. 7, a Harvard University student group called on pro-Hamas activists to 'Bring the war home' and proceeded to vandalize a campus administrative building. The group members, who described themselves as 'anonymous,' later said in a statement, 'We are committed to bringing the war home and answering the call to open up a new front here in the belly of the beast.' On the same day, the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee (PSC) issued a similar statement, saying 'now is the time to escalate,' adding, 'Harvard’s insistence on funding slaughter only strengthens our moral imperative and commitment to our demands.' More recently, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) student wrote a journal article which argued that violence is a legitimate method of effecting political change and, moreover, advancing the pro-Palestinian movement. In September, during Columbia University’s convocation ceremony, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), a group which recently split due to racial tensions between Arabs and non-Arabs, distributed a pamphlet which called on students to join Hamas. 'This booklet is part of a coordinated and intentional effort to uphold the principles of the thawabit and the Palestinian resistance movement overall by transmitting the words of the resistance directly,' said the manifesto, distributed by CUAD, an SJP spinoff, to incoming freshmen. 'This material aims to build popular support for the Palestinian war of national liberation, a war which is waged through armed struggle.' Other sections of it were explicitly Islamist, invoking the name of 'Allah, the most gracious' and referring to Hamas as the 'Islamic Resistance Movement.' Proclaiming, 'Glory to Gaza that gave hope to the oppressed, that humiliated the ‘invincible’ Zionist army,' it said its purpose was to build an army of Muslims worldwide. 'Groups in the pro-terrorism, anti-Israel movement co-exist as our concentric circles of increasing malevolence,' Mauro said of the level of support for revolutionary violence on college campuses. 'Groups in the outermost circle avoid risks as they recruit new protest members and seek to integrate as many political causes as possible under the anti-Israel umbrella … Some militants aspire to incorporate the campaign into a broader wear on law enforcement if not an insurgency.' As The Algemeiner has previously reported, pro-Hamas activists have already demonstrated that they are willing to hurt people to achieve their goals. Last year, in California, an elderly Jewish man was killed when an anti-Zionist professor employed by a local community college allegedly pushed him during an argument. At Cornell University in upstate New York, a student threatened to rape and kill Jewish female students and''shoot up' the campus’ Hillel center. Violence, according to a report by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), was most common at universities in the state of California, where anti-Zionist activists punched a Jewish student for filming him at a protest.

IDF officer KIA in Lebanon, bringing military death toll to 794	His father, Col. (res.) Ilan Dickshtein, previously commanded the IDF’s Etzioni Brigade and the Golani Reconnaissance Battalion. By JNS Israel Defense Forces Lt. Ivri Dickshtein, 21, was killed in action battling Hezbollah terrorists in Southern Lebanon, the IDF said on Thursday night. Dickshtein, a resident of Elazar in the Gush Etzion region of Judea, was a platoon commander in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion. A combat officer from the brigade was seriously wounded in the same incident. The Binyamin Regional Council, which administers large parts of southern and central Samaria, said that Dickshtein, who grew up in the community of Eli, is survived by his wife, parents and five siblings. His father, Col. (res.) Ilan Dickshtein, previously commanded the IDF’s Etzioni Brigade and the Golani Reconnaissance Battalion. According to Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster, the family lives on the same street as the parents of Capt. Shilo Rauchberger, who was killed by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, as well as those of Capt. Roy Beit Ya’akov, who died in a 'friendly fire' incident in May. 'We lost Ivri, a combat officer—the best of Binyamin’s sons—who grew up and was educated here, fought like a hero and fell in defense of the people and their land,' council head Israel Ganz said in the statement. 'The community of Eli, along with the other towns in Binyamin, is at the forefront of the war and is paying a painful price for the revival of the Jewish people in their land,' Ganz said. On Wednesday, six IDF soldiers were killed in a firefight with Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon, while a seventh was moderately wounded. All of them served in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion. The Golani soldiers were ambushed at short range by Hezbollah terrorists after entering a structure where the army had not yet operated. An hours-long firefight ensued, which ended with at least one terrorist dead and the area falling under IDF control. The death toll among Israeli troops since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist massacre now stands at 794, according to IDF figures. Additionally, Ch. Insp. Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Afghanistan’s last Jew arrives in Israel	Simantov, who lived in and took care of Kabul’s synagogue, was spirited out of Afghanistan in a rescue operation led by Moti Kahana, an Israeli-American businessman. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS Zebulon Simantov, Afghanistan’s last Jew, who was rescued from Kabul in September 2021, arrived in Israel last week. Simantov initially went to Turkey, spending three years in Istanbul, and would have continued there but was prompted to move to Israel by ill health, the U.K.’s Jewish News reported on Tuesday. Simantov will settle in Ashdod. In Israel, he has an ex-wife, daughters and five siblings. Simantov, who lived in and took care of Kabul’s synagogue, was spirited out of Afghanistan in a rescue operation led by Moti Kahana, an Israeli-American businessman. Simantov drove his rescuers crazy in the process. 'The hardest thing I ever did was dealing with that guy,' Kahana told JNS at the time, adding that he’s dealt with many crazy people in his line of work, but Simantov is 'definitely on the top of the list.' Simantov had lived under the Taliban from 1996 to 2001 and managed to survive, even while carrying on a fight with the only other Jew in the country, Isaac Levy, who passed away in 2005. (It’s been reported that the Taliban once imprisoned them both and then released them because they couldn’t stand the two constantly arguing.) 'You can be a funny character, but we still have to save your life,' Chabad Rabbi Mendy Chitrik, who is based in Istanbul, told JNS at the time. Chitrik is chairman of the Alliance of Rabbis of Islamic States, an organization serving the religious needs of Jewish communities in places such as Indonesia and Casablanca. 'We were in touch with Simantov for about three years, sending him matzah, asking him if he needed anything,' said Chitrik. Chitrik said he knew Simantov was a character, having read about his fight with Levy and seen videos of conversations, but it still came as a surprise when Simantov demanded that he be paid to leave. 'First, he said he had some debts he had to pay. Then he said he wanted money,' said Chitrik. 'We said we’re not in the business of paying people to get out of Afghanistan. We’re in the business of saving people if they want to be saved.' 'He wanted $50,000. Then he wanted $80,000. Then he wanted $150,000,' said Kahana. Then Simontov changed his mind. 'After Kabul was taken over, a few days into it, he was calling me nonstop to come and get him,' added Kahana. 'I said, ‘Zebulon, it’s too late; my guys are doing other stuff. They can’t come back today.’ ' The reason Simantov reversed his decision to leave Afghanistan was twofold. 'It was his fear of ISIS, and it was his neighbors wanting him to take their kids out,' explained Kahana. Simantov’s neighbors had reason to fear as they belonged to an ethnic minority, the Hazaras, which was persecuted when the Taliban first took over Afghanistan in the 1990s, massacring thousands. Once Simantov agreed to go, he insisted on helping his neighbors’ families. 'We had agreed on 18,' said Kahana. 'But when my team showed up at his home, he had with him 100. My guys asked me, ‘You want to take all these people?’ And I said, ‘No way, we don’t have the equipment. We’ll take the 18 we agreed.’ After negotiation, we squeezed in 30 people.' That brought the total to 31 with Simantov. By then, Chitrik and other rabbis had become aware that there was an issue regarding Simantov’s failure to give his wife a get, or religious divorce. According to Jewish law, a husband must present a divorce document to his wife; when a husband refuses to do so, the wife is unable to remarry. It has been 20 years since Simantov’s wife left him with their daughters to Israel. 'We put a condition on our involvement in his rescue that he would give a divorce to his wife,' said Chitrik. Simantov signed the divorce papers.

Bipartisan bill to bar Hamas supporters from U.S. advances to Sen...	It would also make them ineligible for any relief under current immigration statutes. By Jewish Breaking News Two senators from both sides of the aisle introduced legislation on Wednesday to bar Hamas sympathizers from entering the United States. While federal law already bars terrorists from entering the country, the No Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act, introduced by Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) and Sen. Jacky Rosen (D., Nev.), cuts through any ambiguity by barring any 'representatives, officers, members or spokespersons' of Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and anyone found involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel. It would also make them ineligible for any relief under current immigration statutes. 'Since January 2021, the Biden-Harris administration has released nearly 100 dangerous individuals on the terrorist watchlist into the country, as well as illegal immigrants from U.S. adversaries like Iran,' Blackburn said in a statement. 'This common-sense, bipartisan bill would ensure that no migrant tied to Hamas and the horrific terrorist attack on October 7 is allowed to enter our country or receive immigration benefits on the taxpayer dime.' The bill was first introduced in the House last year by Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) and passed there with a 422-2 vote. Unsurprisingly, the two no votes came from anti-Israel 'Squad' members Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who called the bill 'redundant' and biased against Arabs. 'H.R. 6679 is unnecessary because it is redundant with already existing federal law. It’s just another GOP messaging bill being used to incite anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian, and anti-Muslim hatred that makes communities like ours unsafe,' Tlaib said. As it did in the House, the historic motion is likely to pass in the Senate, sending it to either President Joe Biden or President-elect Donald Trump’s desk for approval or veto.

Harris campaign’s multimillion-dollar debt raises tension with DN...	Harris ended her presidential bid with at least a $20 million debt, a source familiar with her campaign confirmed to NewsNation this week. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Democratic National Committee leaders are frustrated over the prospect of facing a multimillion-dollar debt from Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, Axios reported Wednesday. DNC chairman Jaime Harrison privately criticized the Harris campaign’s spending and expressed concerns about the scale of its debt, sources told Axios. While the campaign raised just over $1 billion in contributions, the Harris-Walz ticket and its allies spent nearly $1.4 billion on political ads alone, outspending the Trump-Vance campaign and Republican groups by about $460 million. The debt could hinder the Democratic Party’s efforts to rebuild and prepare for upcoming elections, according to Axios. DNC leaders are worried about a repeat of the aftermath of Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection, which left the committee over $2 million in debt by late 2015—a strain Hillary Clinton’s team believes contributed to her defeat in the 2016 presidential race. It remains unclear exactly how much debt Harris’s team accumulated as the campaign is still receiving bills from vendors, Axios reported. Harris ended her presidential bid with at least a $20 million debt, a source familiar with her campaign confirmed to NewsNation this week. The campaign has sought to make up for the losses by continuing to solicit donations from supporters and selling its email list, according to reports last week. Many Democrats, including Harris staffers, remain perplexed over how President-elect Donald Trump secured such a decisive victory despite the Harris campaign’s massive spending on high-profile rallies and ads. 'We lost all the swing states. We lost in every county in America,' said Lindy Li, a member of the DNC finance committee. 'This is just astounding. This is not some like blip. This is an avalanche.' 'How do you raise a historic amount of money and not win a single swing state?' a Harris aide asked. 'The honest answer is: I don't know. It seems we lost the national narrative, and that's what we need to diagnose.'

Study links brain stability to treatments for depression, epileps...	Depression, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and other disorders are linked to disruptions in neural stability. By Pesach Benson, TPS New scientific research on how the brain maintains stability amidst continuous environmental and physiological changes offers potential new approaches to treat disorders such as depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy, Israeli researchers said on Thursday. For decades, research has concentrated on how the brain learns and remembers—processes dependent on changes in synaptic connections. However, a Tel Aviv University study found that homeostasis — the brain’s stability — is a foundation for all cognitive functions. Without this stability, processes like learning, memory, and even basic neural communication could falter. 'While brain research has historically focused on synaptic changes that underpin learning and memory, the fundamental stability—or homeostasis—of the brain is equally critical,' said Tel Aviv University Prof. Inna Slutsky Slutsky, in whose laboratory investigated the mechanisms that maintain this balance. Depression, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and other disorders are linked to disruptions in neural stability. The study, published in the peer-reviewed journal, Neuron, zeroed in on NMDA receptors (NMDARs), a type of glutamate receptor found in the brain and nervous system. They play a key role in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and the regulation of neural activity. The research employed three complementary methods: electrophysiological recordings from cultured neurons and living mice, coupled with computational modeling. This comprehensive approach provided a deep understanding of how NMDARs stabilize neural networks. Dr. Antonella Ruggiero, one of the research leaders, utilized an innovative 'dual perturbation' technique developed in Slutsky’s lab. Initially, neurons were exposed to ketamine, a known NMDAR blocker. Under normal conditions, neural networks recover from disruptions, gradually returning to baseline activity levels. However, with NMDAR blocked, the recovery failed, and activity levels remained suppressed. Subsequently, a second disruption was introduced by blocking another receptor. This time, activity recovered but to a new, lower baseline, highlighting NMDAR’s role in setting and maintaining the activity baseline. 'These findings suggest that NMDAR blockers like ketamine impact behavior not only through synaptic plasticity but also by altering the brain’s homeostatic set points,' Ruggiero explained. Further experiments revealed that NMDAR activity activates a calcium-dependent signaling pathway, eEF2K-BDNF, linked to ketamine’s antidepressant effects. Co-leader Leore Heim extended these findings to live animals, focusing on the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory and learning. By infusing NMDAR blockers directly into the hippocampus and recording long-term neural activity, Heim observed a consistent decrease in activity across various states, such as wakefulness and sleep. 'This method allowed us to isolate the hippocampus, avoiding the variability seen in previous studies where drugs were administered systemically,' said Heim. 'Our results demonstrate that NMDARs set the activity baseline in hippocampal networks, with no compensatory recovery after their inhibition.' To understand whether brain stability occurs at the network or individual neuron level, co-leader Dr. Lee Susman developed computational models. His findings indicated that stability is achieved through network-level mechanisms, where averaging activity across neurons reduces noise and enhances signal processing. 'While individual neurons exhibit activity drift, the overall network maintains stability, providing significant computational benefits,' Susman said. The study’s findings could open new avenues of treatment for depression, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s. Ketamine, which blocks NMDARs, was FDA-approved in 2008 as a rapid-acting antidepressant. Overactivity in certain brain regions, such as the lateral habenula, contributes to depression. The study suggests that ketamine could help by resetting this overactivity to a healthier baseline. Understanding how NMDARs stabilize neural networks could lead to treatments preventing epileptic episodes. And targeting NMDARs could help maintain brain function as Alzheimer’s progresses. 'This could pave the way for novel treatments that target neural stability without disrupting essential homeostatic processes,' said Slutsky.

Trump’s top national security picks have expressed strongly pro-I...	Among his top national security picks, the president-elect has chosen the US. Rep. Mike Waltz to serve as his national security adviser and nominated Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner US President-elect Donald Trump’s selections for national security adviser and defense secretary have a history of making statements in support of Israel’s right to defend itself from neighboring threats. In the week following his resounding victory at the polls, Trump has swiftly moved to fill his incoming cabinet with allies of Israel. Among his top national security picks, the president-elect has chosen US. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL) to serve as his national security adviser and nominated Fox News host and Army National Guard officer Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense. Waltz, a Green Beret and former Pentagon policy adviser, has developed a hawkish reputation on foreign policy matters. He supported Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Iran in October, arguing that the Jewish state should target Kharg Island, a major hub of the regime’s oil exports. The representative also suggested that Israel attack Iran’s nuclear facilities outside of Tehran. The lawmaker has openly criticized the Biden administration for allegedly holding Israel back from a full force retaliation against Iran. Waltz has also argued that the US should attempt to weaken Iran through sanctioning the Chinese buyers of Iranian oil, saying that isolating Iran economically would cripple their ability to finance the operations of terrorist groups such as Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah. He has also helped spearhead bipartisan efforts to recategorize the Houthis in Yemen as an official international terrorist organization, a move that he argues would isolate the group by making financial transactions with them illegal. On Tuesday, Trump raised eyebrows by tapping Hegseth to head the Pentagon. Hegseth, a former infantry officer in the Army National Guard deployed to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, has repeatedly expressed affinity for Israel. Hegseth, a devout Christian, argued on television that Jews have a right to live in Israel on Biblical grounds. In his 2020 book, American Crusade, Our Fight to Stay Free, he stated that Israel is 'central to the story of Western civilization' and that the Jewish state is 'inextricably linked' to America. 'If you love America, you should love Israel. We share history, we share faith, and we share freedom. We love free people, free expression, and free markets,' he wrote. 'And whereas America is blessed with two big, beautiful oceans to protect it, Israel is surrounded on all sides by countries that either used to seek, or still seek, to wipe the nation off the map.' During a 2016 trip to Israel, Hegseth said that he was 'struck by the pervasive sense of purpose which permeates Israel and its people who understand the special nature of its founding and defense.' He also said that America can 'learn from Israel' and that the Jewish state 'is indispensable for the future of the West and human freedom.' Following the 2020 killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, who headed the Quds Force responsible for overseeing Iran’s proxies and terrorist operations abroad, Hegseth urged then-President Trump to bomb Iran’s nuclear production facilities. 'I happen to believe that we can’t kick the can down the road any longer in trying to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb. They used the killing of Soleimani as an excuse to say ‘we’re scrapping the Iran Deal.’ We all know they were scrapping it anyway,' Hegseth said on Fox News, adding that America should notify Iran of its plans to destroy its 'nuclear production facilities,' 'key infrastructure,' 'missile sites,' and 'port capabilities.' Hegseth also argued that attempts to restrain Israel from direct confrontation with Iran are 'ridiculous' and that the Islamic regime represents an 'existential threat' to the Jewish state. 'Israel wants to deal with Iran, we should let them … If it was not for Israel, Iran would have had the bomb already,' he said.

IDF: Over 140 Hezbollah launchers destroyed in Southern Lebanon	In the past week, the IDF has eliminated over 200 Hezbollah operatives in Southern Lebanon in air and ground operations, according to the IDF. By JNS Over 140 Hezbollah rocket launchers in Southern Lebanon were destroyed by Israeli airstrikes over the past week, the Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday. The launchers posed an immediate threat to Israeli civilians and troops, according to the military. Among the launchers destroyed were the ones used in attacks on the Western Galilee area on Wednesday night, as well as those used in attacks on central Israel on both Wednesday and Tuesday, the IDF said. מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר, בהכוונת פיקוד הצפון, תקפו והשמידו במהלך השבוע האחרון יותר מ-140 משגרים של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה בדרום לבנון בסגירות מעגל מהירות. משגרים אלו היוו איום מיידי על העורף הישראלי ועל כוחות צה'ל אשר פועלים בדרום לבנון>> pic.twitter.com/54wHV5hANq &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 14, 2024 On Tuesday, the IAF eliminated a battalion commander and an anti-tank missile commander of Hezbollah’s Radwan Force in the coastal region. A Radwan Force company commander was also killed. In the past week, the IDF has eliminated over 200 Hezbollah operatives in Southern Lebanon in air and ground operations, according to the IDF. 'These strikes further degrade Hezbollah’s capability to carry out terror attacks from Southern Lebanon against Israeli civilians on the northern border,' the army said. 'The IDF will continue to operate to thwart any danger or threat against the State of Israel.' IDF ground operations in Southern Lebanon continued on Thursday as part of 'Operation Northern Arrows,' with troops over the past 24 hours locating and dismantling rocket and mortar launchers, as well as terrorist infrastructure, including underground sites and several explosives stockpiles. כוחות צה'ל ממשיכים לפעול בדרום לבנון. לוחמי צוות הקרב של חטיבה 226, בפיקוד אוגדה 146, החלו לפעול במרחב נגד ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה>> pic.twitter.com/BtahXClghk &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 14, 2024 In addition, the IAF conducted over 100 air strikes over the past 24 hours, targeting command centers, weapons storage facilities, launchers and terror infrastructure. Meanwhile, Hezbollah continued its rocket attacks on Israel on Thursday morning, triggering sirens in several communities in the country’s north. On Wednesday, Hezbollah launched 50 rockets into Israeli territory.

Israel, Hezbollah ‘closer than ever’ to a ceasefire, says ministe...	Israeli government minister says that Jerusalem and the Iranian-backed terror group are closer than ever to reaching a ceasefire deal, but one major sticking point remains. By World Israel News Staff Israel and the Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah are now closer than ever before to reaching a deal which would enable the two to enter into a long-term ceasefire, a senior Israeli government minister said Thursday. After 404 days since large-scale attacks by Hezbollah terrorists began along the Israel-Lebanon frontier, efforts by the U.S. to broker a ceasefire are now 'closer' than they have been than at any other time 'since the start of the war,' Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen (Likud) told Reuters in an interview published Thursday afternoon. 'I think we are at a point that we are closer to an arrangement than we have been since the start of the war,' Cohen said. Ever since Israeli forces entered southern Lebanon on October 1st, the Biden administration has sought to secure a truce between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel has demanded that the Iranian proxy group withdraw away from the Israeli frontier to the northern bank of the Litani River, and that the IDF retain the right to operate in Lebanon should Hezbollah violate the agreement. Furthermore, Israel has sought mechanisms to ensure the disarming of the Shi'ite Muslim terror group. Recent reports claim that Russia has joined the U.S. effort to broker a deal, with Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer reportedly visiting Russia as part of ceasefire talks last week, before meeting with U.S. Secretary of State this week. Nevertheless, despite the progress made, Cohen emphasized that there still remain some obstacles to a deal, including Hezbollah's refusal to accept Israel's insistence on retaining the right to operate in Lebanon should the terror group abrogate a future deal. 'We will be less forgiving than in the past over attempts to create strongholds in territory near Israel,' Cohen said.

‘Critical condition’ – Israeli hostages may have lost half of the...	Israeli captives still held in the Gaza Strip likely have suffered severe starvation for over a year and are at high risk for malnutrition and freezing as winter approaches, experts warn. By World Israel News Staff Dozens of Israeli hostages still being held hostage by terrorists in the Gaza Strip have likely lost roughly half of their body weight over the past thirteen months and are at increasing risk of malnutrition and frostbite as winter approaches, experts warned in a report Wednesday. On Wednesday night, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum's health team, headed by epidemiologist and former chairman of Israel's Association of Public Health Physicians Dr. Hagai Levine, released a report regarding the conditions of the surviving Israeli captives held hostage in the Gaza Strip. Of the 101 captives still in Gaza, Israeli intelligence suggests that 50 are most likely dead, with 51 believed to be still alive. In its report Wednesday, the Health Team of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said that given the duration and conditions the captives have been held in since October 7th, 2023, they have likely lost a significant amount of body mass, potentially as much as half of their pre-invasion weight. As a consequence of their long-term nutritional deficiencies, the report warns, the surviving hostages are likely suffering from 'dangerously low muscle' mass levels, and are now 'highly vulnerable to hypothermia, frostbite, and respiratory infections,' leaving them at elevated risk for a plethora of maladies in the upcoming winter season. The Health Team also wrote that the hostages are likely suffering from severe mental health issues, including 'despair and suicidal thoughts,' fueled by 'psychological trauma from isolation, violence, and lack of family contact.' 'The captives are in critical condition,' tweeted Dr. Levine Wednesday night, calling the new report 'hair-raising.' 'Those who have survived are in immediate danger of death due to many threats.'

CAIR accuses President Biden and senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Blinken and Secretary of Defense Austin, of being 'war criminals' after White House declines to impose arms embargo on Israel. By World Israel News Staff The largest Muslim advocacy group in the United States has accused President Joe Biden and other senior administration officials of being war criminals, after the administration declined to impose an arms embargo on Israel this week. On Wednesday, the 30-day deadline set by the administration for Israel to come into compliance with the October 13th memorandum demanding changes in the Gaza Strip expired. The Biden administration had hinted that unless Israel made satisfactory changes to reduce the isolation of northern Gaza, ensure the entry of additional aid trucks, and lessen the use of mass evacuation orders in Gaza, the White House would restrict the transfer of military equipment to Israel. On the eve of the deadline, however, the State Department announced that it had not determined Israel to be in violation of the memorandum, thereby avoiding a confrontation with Jerusalem. The Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a group linked in the past to the Hamas terror organization which appeared after the October 7th, 2023 invasion of Israel to defend the group's actions, on Wednesday castigated Biden and other senior administration officials over the decision not to limit arms transfers to Israel. In a statement released by CAIR, the organization accused Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin of war crimes. 'We strongly condemn President Biden’s decision to continue illegally supplying the Israeli government with deadly weapons even after Benjamin Netanyahu violated the 30-day deadline that the administration set for Israel to stop starving Gaza,' CAIR said in a statement Wednesday. 'We never thought this day would come, but we must speak the truth plainly and clearly: President Biden is a war criminal. So is Antony Blinken. So is Lloyd Austin. We condemn them in the strongest terms, and so will history.'

Next US Defense Secretary backed reestablishment of Jewish Temple...	In 2018, Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's choice for Secretary of Defense, shared his thoughts on the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. By World Israel News Staff The next American Secretary of Defense, Fox News journalist and army veteran Pete Hegseth, has made comments in the past seemingly endorsing the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, Arutz Sheva reported Thursday. Former President and President-elect Donald Trump announced his selection of Hegseth on Tuesday to head the Pentagon, touting Hegseth as a 'tough, smart and a true believer in America First.' A long-time and vocal supporter of Israel, Hegseth also appeared in a pro-Israel conference six years ago to lend support to Jewish aspirations to rebuild the historic Temple on Jerusalem's Temple Mount. In 2018, Hegseth addressed the annual Arutz Sheva - Israel National News conference, during which he lauded then-President Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital city and relocating the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. 'When you stand there, you cannot help but behold the miracle before you,' Hegseth said. 'It got me thinking about another miracle I hope all of you don't see as too far away,' Hegseth continued, suggesting that like the Balfour Declaration, the establishment of the State of Israel, and the liberation of the Old City of Jerusalem, the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem is attainable. '1917 was a miracle, 1948 was a miracle, 1967 was a miracle, 2017, the declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was a miracle, and there's no reason why the miracle of the reestablishment of the Temple on the Temple Mount is not possible.' 'I don't know how it would happen, you don't know how it would happen, but I know that it could happen, that's all I know.' Hegseth went on to back the extension of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, calling it the 'critical next step' for Israel.

Israel questions fitness of ICC judge to investigate Netanyahu	Beti Hohler had previously served in the prosecutor’s office of the international court. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel is questioning the impartiality of one of the three judges probing whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant should be arrested for war crimes by the International Criminal Court (ICC), Reuters reported Wednesday. Slovenian judge Beti Hohler was appointed three weeks ago following the resignation of the presiding judge, Romanian justice Iulia Motoc, for health reasons. Reuters saw a statement sent to the court by Israel’s Attorney General's office asking for Hohler to 'provide information to clarify whether there are (or are not) grounds to reasonably doubt her impartiality,' considering that her previous position had been to serve as an attorney in the ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor (OTP). 'Israel does not suggest that judge Hohler's previous employment with the OTP necessarily or automatically gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of a lack of impartiality,' the statement said. 'However, judges of this Court have acknowledged that previous duties within the OTP may, depending on the circumstances, give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.' This request may further delay the panel’s decision on whether to indict Netanyahu and Gallant for their alleged 'criminal responsibility for&#8230;war crimes and crimes against humanity' in the Gaza Strip during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The request for an arrest warrant, made in May by ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, also included three Hamas heads for their leading roles in the invasion of Israel last October 7, in which Hamas-led terrorists massacred 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, 97 of whom, both dead and alive, are still in captivity. Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh and Mohammed Deif have since been killed by Israel, although Haniyeh’s death in Tehran was not officially acknowledged as an Israeli hit job. Israel, along with several of its allies and legal organizations, had previously submitted official challenges to the warrant. These outlined the ICC's 'manifest lack of jurisdiction' in the case and charged that the court was violating its own statutes by 'failing to provide Israel with the opportunity to exercise its right to investigate by itself the claims raised by the Prosecutor, before proceeding,' the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in its accompanying statement in September. 'No other democracy with an independent and respected legal system like that which exists in Israel has been treated in this prejudicial manner by the Prosecutor,' the Ministry added. Khan, who had asked that the judges make a quick decision when presenting the arrest request, has since become the subject of an external investigation due to complaints by a former underling that he had made many improper and unwanted sexual advances to her while she worked in his office.

EU’s top diplomat calls to end cooperation with Israel, breaking ...	European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell proposes measure to suspend decades-old agreement with Israel and end 'political dialog' with the Jewish state, citing ongoing war with Hamas. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The European Union's foreign affairs chief is calling on the 27-state body to dramatically limit the EU's ties with Israel, accusing the Jewish state of human rights violations in connection with the ongoing war against the Hamas terror organization. On Wednesday, Josep Borrell, the Spanish lawmaker currently serving as High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, penned a missive to the foreign ministers representing the EU's 27 member states ahead of a joint meeting scheduled for Monday. In the letter, Borrell proposed suspending the June 2000 EU-Israel Association Agreement, which upgraded ties between Israel and the EU and established a formal, legal framework for political dialog between the two aimed at facilitating better relations and closer cooperation. The agreement established a committee and council to ensure regular communication between Israel and the EU. Borrell, however, called to suspend the 'political dialog' enshrined under the agreement, accusing Israel of human rights violations in the Gaza Strip. 'In light of the above considerations, I will be tabling a proposal that the EU should invoke the human rights clause to suspend the political dialog with Israel,' Borrell wrote, according to a report by Reuters. Borrell was quoted as citing 'serious concerns about possible breaches of international humanitarian law in Gaza,' while claiming that 'thus far, these concerns have not been sufficiently addressed by Israel.' According to the report, which cited three diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity, a number of European Union member state foreign ministers raised issues with the proposal Wednesday, signaling that Borrell was unlikely to secure the unanimous support necessary to move forward with his plan. Monday's meeting marks the last joint meeting of EU foreign ministers that Borrell is expected to lead before leaving office on December 1st. Borrell has long criticized Israeli policy, and has frequently been at odds with Jerusalem regarding its wars against the Hamas and Hezbollah terror organizations after October 7th, 2023. In March, Borrell accused Israel of 'provoking famine' in the Gaza Strip, while calling Gaza the world’s 'greatest open-air prison' and 'greatest open-air graveyard.' In August, he proposed that the EU sanction two senior Israeli government ministers, leading the Israeli government to bar him from entering the country while still in office.

CIA agent arrested for leaking Israeli Iran attack info	Asif W. Rahman was arrested in Cambodia and indicted under the Espionage Act. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A CIA agent was arrested by the FBI Tuesday for leaking highly classified information on Israel’s planned attack on Iran following the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile barrage on the Jewish state on October 1st. Asif W. Rahman was arrested in Cambodia and brought to federal court in Guam to be charged under the Espionage Act with two counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information. Rahman had top-secret security clearance, which would allow him to see the classified files that included satellite photos of possible target sites, which were prepared mid-month by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. According to CNN, one of the documents also indicated that Israel has nuclear weapons, something that the Jewish state has never confirmed, preferring to keep the extremely sensitive issue officially ambiguous. They were marked 'top secret' and for viewing by the 'Five Eyes' allies only, namely the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The leak occurred 'on or about October 17,' the indictment said, with the documents appearing on a Telegram account called 'Middle East Spectator,' which is operated out of Iran and is used to propagate the regime’s messaging. The account said that it had received the documents anonymously and could not authenticate their contents. 'It is very troubling to know that a CIA officer may have been involved in leaking this highly classified information,' Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, told The New York Post. 'Everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence, but if true, this is a serious security breach and there is no excuse for it,' he added. The Americans apologized to Israel after the leak was discovered and immediately opened an investigation to find those responsible. In the event, the leak seemingly did not affect the eventual Israeli retaliation on October 26, in which more than 120 planes and UAVs attacked sites throughout Iran and destroyed its most advanced anti-missile systems and most of its air defenses, as well as military facilities that produced vital ballistic missile components and mixed solid fuel for the missiles. The Justice Department has asked that Rahman’s trial be moved to the federal court in Virginia.

Soros-backed dark money giant bankrolled the fiscal sponsor of US...	In 2023, the Tides network raked in nearly $800 million, according to its audited financial statements. By Andrew Kerr, The Washington Free Beacon The Tides Foundation, a left-wing dark money giant backed by George Soros and other progressive billionaires, bankrolled the fiscal sponsor of the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, an anti-Semitic group sanctioned in the United States for providing financial support to terrorists, according to newly released tax forms. The foundation reported in its latest Form 990 tax return that it granted $286,000 to the Alliance for Global Justice in 2023, a group best known for serving as the fiscal sponsor of Samidoun. The Treasury Department in October sanctioned Samidoun as a 'sham charity' that provided material support to a Palestinian terrorist organization that participated in the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist rampage in Israel. Canada levied its own sanctions against Samidoun as well in October, labeling the group a 'terrorist entity' under its criminal code. Founded in 1998, the Alliance for Global Justice let Samidoun borrow its charitable tax privileges to operate and raise funds in the United States without obtaining its own organizational credentials. In other words, the Alliance for Global Justice and Samidoun are legally indistinguishable. It’s unclear if the group continued to serve as Samidoun’s fiscal sponsor after the Treasury Department sanctioned the terrorism financier in October. The Tides Foundation said the purpose of its grant to the Alliance for Global Justice in 2023 was to support a 'sustainable environment.' It’s unclear if the Tides grant went to support Samidoun or one of the several dozen other fiscally sponsored organizations operating under the Alliance for Global Justice’s tax ID. The Treasury Department in October described Samidoun as a 'sham charity that serves as an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) terrorist organization.' The PFLP cut its teeth in the late 1960s by hijacking and opening fire on commercial airplanes, and later participated in the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel. It leverages Samidoun as a front organization in both Europe and North America to bankroll its terrorist activities, the Treasury Department said in October. Samidoun is also banned in Germany for its overt support of Hamas terrorism. Samidoun’s U.S. leaders don’t shy away from their terroristic tendencies. Its leaders, Charlotte Kates and her husband, Khaled Barakat, explicitly endorsed terrorism against Jews during a lecture in March before the anti-Israel student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the Washington Free Beacon reported. The Treasury Department sanctioned Barakat in October for his 'fundraising and recruitment' efforts for the PFLP’s 'terrorist activity against Israel,' adding that he has publicly acknowledged Samidoun’s affiliation with the terrorist network. Tides and the Alliance for Global Justice did not return requests for comment. Major donors to the Tides network include liberal billionaire financier George Soros, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and the Ford Foundation. In 2023, the Tides network raked in nearly $800 million, according to its audited financial statements. The Tides network is hardly the only liberal dark money giant to bankroll the Alliance for Global Justice. In 2021, Tides and the New Venture Fund, the largest branch of the Arabella Advisors dark money behemoth, donated more than $9 million to the Alliance for Global Justice. The Arabella Advisors network donated an additional $1 million to the Alliance for Global Justice in 2022, the Free Beacon reported. The Arabella Advisors network distanced itself from Samidoun after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, telling the Free Beacon that Samidoun 'is not and has never been a client of Arabella Advisors' and that it 'unequivocally condemn[s] terrorism and violence against civilians.' The Tides network has offered no such denunciation of the terrorism financier.

Oldest spindle whorls found in Israel: Early textile tools rewrit...	The Natufians, who lived 11,500-15,000 years ago, were among the earliest groups to settle in permanent or semi-permanent villages. By Pesach Benson, TPS Researchers uncovered 12,000-year-old spindle whorls in northern Israel, predating previously known textile tools in the region by 4,000 years, Hebrew University announced on Wednesday. The artifacts, associated with the Natufian culture, mark a pivotal moment in human technological development as societies transitioned from hunting and gathering to agriculture. A spindle whorl is a small, weighted tool used in spinning fibers into yarn or thread. It is typically a round or disk-shaped object with a hole in the center, designed to be attached to a spindle stick, which is a thin rod. Together, they form a simple tool for transforming raw fibers, like wool, flax, or cotton, into usable thread for weaving or other textile processes. The study, led by Talia Yashuv and Professor Leore Grosman from the Hebrew University’s Institute of Archaeology, used advanced digital 3D modeling to analyze more than 100 perforated limestone pebbles recovered from the Nahal-Ein Gev II dig site near the Sea of Galilee. Experimental replicas successfully demonstrated their function, affirming their role in early textile production. 'These Natufian perforated stones are actually the first wheels in form and function,' Grosman explained. 'They represent an early iteration of wheel-based technology, long before the invention of the wheel for transport.' The Natufians, who lived 11,500-15,000 years ago, were among the earliest groups to settle in permanent or semi-permanent villages. They built stone and mud structures, some of which included circular or oval houses with stone foundations. 'This study emphasizes the Natufians’ role as technological pioneers,' said Yashuv. 'Their innovations laid the groundwork for future breakthroughs like the potter’s wheel and the cart, shaping the trajectory of human history.' The findings were published in the peer-reviewed PLOS ONE journal.

Students for Justice in Palestine group loses lawsuit against Col...	Both SJP and JVP have been instrumental in organizing disruptive anti-Israel protests on Columbia’s campus. By Dion J. Pierre, The Algemeiner A New York judge has upheld Columbia University’s suspension of its Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter, a measure taken against the campus group after it launched of spree of assaults, hate campaigns, and disruptive protests following the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel last Oct. 7. SJP, as well as its affiliate pro-Hamas partner Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), sued the university in March, alleging that its suspension perpetuated 'already pervasive dangerous stereotypes about Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims,' and other minority groups. Represented by the New York chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the groups sought to have their status restored by appealing to the courts, as well as the public, whom it attempted to convince that Columbia University, one of the most culturally left-wing higher education institutions in the country, discriminates against minorities of color. The strategy proved unsuccessful last week, as Judge Nicholas Moyne of the New York State Supreme Court, who presided over the case, ruled that the university had sufficient cause to suspend the two groups. 'After reviewing the record, the court finds that Columbia University’s decision to temporarily suspend the petitioners from their status as recognized student groups was neither arbitrary or capricious, irrational, or in violation of clearly established university policies,' Moyne said in his decision. 'Accordingly, the petition is denied and the cross-motion to dismiss the petition is granted. All student groups at Columbia are subject to and required to comply with Columbia’s special events policies, which govern, inter alia, when, where, and how events on campus, including protests and demonstrations, may be held and what notice needs to be given to university officials prior to the commencement of any student group events, demonstrations, or protests.' Columbia University suspended SJP and JVP in last November, explaining in a statement that the groups had 'repeatedly violated university policies related to holding campus events, culminating in an unauthorized event … that proceeded despite warnings and included threatening rhetoric and intimidation.' Both SJP and JVP have been instrumental in organizing disruptive anti-Israel protests on Columbia’s campus since Hamas invaded Israel last Oct. 7 and killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Even after being disciplined, however, SJP members continued their activities in front groups — such as Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), a non-campus affiliated organization that supports the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel — staging more protests in flagrant violation of the terms of its suspension. ACLU’s portrayal of pro-Hamas students as peaceful and artistic victims of racism has always been in tension with how Jewish Columbia students have described their behavior and the university’s response to it. Anti-Israel activists have chanted 'F— the Jews,' 'Death to Jews,' 'Jews will not defeat us,' and 'From water to water, Palestine will be Arab,' on campus grounds since the Oct. 7 atrocities, violating the school’s code of conduct, according to a lawsuit filed against Columbia University earlier this year by StandWithUs, a Jewish civil rights organization. In other alleged incidents, they allegedly beat up five Jewish students in Columbia’s Butler Library and attacked another with a stick, lacerating his head and breaking his finger. Anti-Jewish violence and hatred became so common, the lawsuit charged, that Columbia told Jewish students that campus security could no longer guarantee their safety. Jewish victims at Columbia have prevailed in other lawsuits filed against the university in recent months. In June, the university’s legal counsel settled a case in which it was accused of neglecting its obligation to foster a safe learning environment amid riotous pro-Hamas protests that were held at the school throughout the final weeks of the 2023-2024 academic year. The resolution of the case, first reported by Reuters, called for Columbia to hire a 'Safe Passage Liaison' who will monitor protests and 'walking escorts' who will accompany students whose safety is threatened around the campus. Other details of the settlement include 'accommodations' for students whose academic lives are disrupted by protests and new security policies for controlling access to school property. 'We’re pleased we’ve been able to come to a resolution and remain committed to our number one priority: the safety of our campus so that all of our students can successfully pursue their education and meet their academic goals,' the university told The Algemeiner after the settlement was announced. The university is the target of another pro-Hamas lawfare suit in which the plaintiff is on the record promoting antisemitic hatred. In October, the school was sued for discrimination by a student, Khymani James, whom officials suspended for filming himself proclaim that Zionists should be murdered and are fortunate that he has not begun killing them himself. James alleges that the suspension — prompted by the incident and other misconduct charges Columbia filed against him for participating in an illegal pro-Hamas encampment — was racist and aimed at 'privileging a subset of Jewish people.'

IDF strikes Syria-Lebanon border for second time in week, Damascu...	The IAF strikes targeted bridges and military checkpoints in the border region. By JNS Syrian state media reported on Wednesday evening that Israeli Air Force fighter jets conducted aerial raids in the area of Al-Qusayr, near the Arab Republic’s western border with Lebanon. Damascus state-run SANA news agency claimed that the country’s air defenses 'confronted hostile targets in the skies of the western Homs countryside' in response to what it described as 'Israeli aggression.' The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based war monitor with links to the country’s opposition, reported that the IAF strikes targeted bridges and military checkpoints in the border region. The Israeli Air Force previously carried out raids on Hezbollah targets in Al-Qusayr on Nov. 5, attacking munitions depots used by the Lebanon-based Iranian-backed terrorist army. 'Hezbollah’s Munitions Unit is responsible for storing weapons inside Lebanon and has recently expanded its activities into the area of Al-Qusayr, near the Syria-Lebanon border,' the military confirmed on X. Israeli jets also struck terrorism-related targets in Al-Qusayr on Oct. 31, including arms-storage facilities, and command and control centers used by Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force and its Munitions Unit. On Sunday, Arab media reported that a Hezbollah terrorist commander convicted for the 2005 murder of former Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri was eliminated in one of the IAF airstrikes on Al-Qusayr. Israel rarely acknowledges attacking Syria; however, in February, Jerusalem revealed that it had struck more than 50 targets belonging to Hezbollah and other Iranian terror proxies in the country since Oct. 7, 2023. Earlier this week, Israeli jets reportedly attacked Hezbollah targets near Shinshar on the outskirts of Homs, killing nine terrorist operatives. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that the IAF strikes targeted an ammunition storage facility on the Homs-Damascus road.

Ceremony honoring October 7th mastermind will take place in Canad...	City in Ontario refuses to shut down planned vigil in public square honoring Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief and architect of the October 7th massacres. By World Israel News Staff Pro-Hamas activists in Canada are planning to hold a public vigil honoring the architect of the October 7th massacres of Israelis, after municipal officials announced they would not interfere with the planned event. The event is set to be held on Tuesday, November 26th, at Mississauga City Hall’s Celebration Square in Mississauga, a city of 718,000 in the greater Toronto area. Flyers advertising the event were spotted last week, using the poppy flower symbol, established by the Royal Canadian Legion as a way to pay tribute to Canadian veterans, next to a photograph of the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar with the words 'Lest We Forget Our Heroes: Vigil For Resistance Leaders.' One advertisement said the event would commemorate '40 days after the Martyrdom of the leaders of Resistance fighting for Palestinian freedom.' No organization has been linked to the planned event, with only an email address, allheavens313@gmail.com, provided in the ads. Advertisement for a vigil honoring Yahya Sinwar in the Canadian city of Mississauga. (X) An anti-Israel activist, Faris Al Najim, released a video on November 11th, Remembrance Day, announcing the event in honor of Sinwar. The City of Mississauga has come under fire after city officials announced they would not be interfering with the planned event. 'The City of Mississauga has become aware of a vigil planned for November 26, 2024 to take place on Celebration Square,' city officials said in a statement. 'The City has not issued a permit for this group to host a vigil. It is not the City’s practice to issue permits for vigils as Celebration Square is a public space, usable by the community. Under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, groups have the right of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The City will not interfere with a peaceful vigil, as long as all laws and City by-laws are adhered to.' Social media users were quick to point out that the event constitutes promotion of Hamas, which Canada has banned as a terror organization. 'Everybody knows if the KKK were to hold a rally honouring the death of their leader, it would not be permitted to happen any more than if a bunch of Nazis decided to mark Hitler’s birthday,' columnist Joe Warmington wrote in the Toronto Sun. 'Hamas is not any different and is a banned terror group in Canada. Celebrating them is obscene — and hurtful to the families of their victims.' The Royal Canadian Legion has penned a cease-and-desist letter to the event’s organizers over their unauthorized use of the Legion’s poppy flower symbol. Mississauga Mayor Carolyn Parrish defended the city’s refusal to bar the event, saying any such steps would constitute 'preferential treatment.' 'That would be called censorship, preferential treatment, being judgmental — the stifling of freedom of speech which is something most Canadians value,' the mayor tweeted. On Monday night, Parrish appeared to deny that the event was actually going to be held, suggesting the ads were part of a hoax. 'Consulted a network of Muslim organizations, serious partners in many activities of our city - coaching sports, walkathons for Trillium Hospital and diabetes. I asked them to track down the anonymous notice for a vigil at City Hall. No organization exists. No vigil is planned,' the mayor tweeted.

US hostages’ families urge Trump-Biden collaboration to free capt...	Trump warned that that if Hamas does not release the hostages before he takes office on January 20, the terror group will pay '​​a very big price.' By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden met with the families of American citizens kidnapped on October 7th and held hostage in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, hosting them at the White House. Biden 'provided an update on US efforts to secure the release of all hostages, and reaffirmed the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to getting the hostages home to their loved ones and families,' read a White House statement about the meeting. 'The Administration has worked tirelessly to get a deal done as soon as possible to bring the hostages home, and the President also assured the families those efforts will continue,' the statement added. 'Our aim is to encourage the outgoing administration to collaborate vigorously and decisively with the incoming administration to resolve the situation and bring the hostages home. They must do whatever it takes,' Ronen Neutra, father of hostage Omer, told Ynet. Neutra referenced Trump's remarks at the Republican National Convention in July. At the time, Trump warned that that if Hamas does not release the hostages before he takes office on January 20, the terror group will pay '​​a very big price.' Neutra urged Biden and Trump to 'work with full force,' adding that 'ultimately, both leaders deserve credit if they succeed.' 'It's up to them now. We are very hopeful to hear from President Biden that this issue transcends party lines and that the teams will quickly commence joint work.' Jonthan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz more than a year ago, told the Times of Israel that he and the other hostages' families encouraged Biden to partner with Trump on ramping up efforts for a deal to release the captives. 'Our requests… of both administrations right now is they work together, not to prepare the Trump administration for taking office in late January, but rather to get this done now in this unique moment,' Dekel-Chen said. Dekel-Chen warned that if there is no deal until after president-elect Trump takes office in January, 'there’s a very real possibility that none of the hostages will remain alive, and it will be nearly impossible to retrieve the remains of those who have been murdered.'

Israel to ‘gift’ Trump with Lebanon ceasefire in January – Report	Israeli official claims that Israel will give Trump a major foreign policy win, soon after the president-elect takes office. By World Israel News Staff A senior aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told president-elect Donald Trump that Israel is gearing up for a ceasefire deal with Lebanon, in order to 'gift' the leader a major foreign-policy win once he takes office in January 2025. According to a Washington Post report, Ron Dermer - Netanyahu’s minister of strategic affairs - visited Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to update Trump and his team about the status of the ongoing ceasefire negotiations. Dermer confirmed to the Post that he had met with Trump and his associates, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, but declined to give specifics about the content of the discussions. 'There is an understanding that Israel would gift something to Trump … that in January there will be an understanding about Lebanon,' an anonymous Israeli official told the Post. 'The one thing Netanyahu cares more about than Trump is his own domestic politics, and getting Israeli civilians back to the north is a major objective that he may not want to wait on,' he said. Frank Lowenstein, a former special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under President Barack Obama, speculated that Israel may already have a blueprint in place for a temporary agreement. Once Trump assumes office, Lowenstein said, a permanent ceasefire may be signed. But, the strategist said that Netanyahu would prioritize his constituents over a potential gesture to the U.S. president. 'The one thing Netanyahu cares more about than Trump is his own domestic politics, and getting Israeli civilians back to the north is a major objective that he may not want to wait on,' he told the Post. Lebanese politicians have signaled that some Israeli conditions for the ceasefire - such as the ability of Israel to continue acting against Hezbollah in Lebanese territory, should the terror group violate the agreement - are unacceptable to Lebanon. 'Is there any sane person who believes that we will agree to a settlement or a solution that serves Israel’s interests at the expense of Lebanon’s interests and sovereignty?' Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri said Tuesday.

Defense Minister says Israel won’t accept Lebanon ceasefire unles...	The provision that Hezbollah should not be allowed south of the Litani River was included in the ceasefire that ended the Second Lebanon War. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Newly-appointed defense minister Israel Katz, when speaking to Northern Command on Wednesday, declared that Israel wouldn't accept a ceasefire deal with Lebanon unless it mandates the retreat of Hezbollah to the north of the Litani river and that the terror group disarms. The requirement that Hezbollah evacuate southern Lebanon, known as Resolution 1701, was a provision in the ceasefire agreement that ended the Second Lebanon War in 2006, but wasn't enforced effectively. Addressing Northern Command, Katz said, 'We will not agree to just any ceasefires, we will not take our foot off the gas, and we will not accept any agreement that does not include achieving the war goals.' Any agreement should include 'The disarmament of Hezbollah, its withdrawal beyond the Litani [River], and creating the conditions for the residents of the north to return to their homes in safety,' Katz explained. In addition, Israel said it should have the right to enforce any ceasefire deal and 'act against any terrorist activity and organization.' Regarding the progress of the war, Katz said, 'We have inflicted severe blows on Hezbollah, and we have eliminated Nasrallah - and therefore, precisely now, we need to continue to hit them with all our might to reap the fruits of victory. The United States has increased diplomatic activity because they aim for a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon before US President Joe Biden leaves office on January 20th. The US agrees with Israel's demand that Hezbollah retreat north of the Litani River, although US officials are searching for a way to enforce 1701, whereas Israel feels it should enforce the agreement. Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday to discuss the ceasefire deal proposed. France has also been involved in negotiations and its Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot visited Israel last week.

6 IDF soldiers killed in a battle with Hezbollah terrorists	The Golani soldiers were ambushed at short range by Hezbollah terrorists after entering a structure where the army had not yet operated. By JNS Six members of the Israel Defense Forces were killed on Wednesday morning in a firefight with Hezbollah terrorists in Southern Lebanon, while a seventh was moderately wounded, the military announced on Wednesday night. Five of the slain soldiers were identified as IDF Capt. Itay Marcovich, 21, from Kokhav Ya’ir; Staff Sgt. Sraya Elboim, 21, from Mehola; Staff Sgt. Dror Hen, 20, from Gan Haim; Staff. Sgt. Nir Gofer, 20, from Dimona; and Sgt. Shalev Itzhak Sagron, 21, from Sderot. All of them served in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion, the army said. The name of the last soldier killed was not yet approved for publication, local media reported, adding that his family had been informed. According to Israel’s Ynet outlet, the Golani soldiers were ambushed at short range by Hezbollah terrorists after entering a structure where the army had not yet operated. An hours-long firefight ensued, which ended with at least one terrorist dead and the area falling under IDF control. The military was said to have launched an investigation into suspicions that the terrorists emerged from an underground terror tunnel and were not harmed in the airstrikes that preceded the ground maneuver. On Tuesday morning, the IDF released the names of four troops killed in action fighting Hamas terrorists in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip. The IDF soldiers, members of the Kfir Brigade’s Shimshon Battalion 92, were identified as Staff Sgt. Orr Katz, 20, from Ma’ale Adumim; Staff Sgt. Nave Yair Asulin, 21, from Carmit; Staff Sgt. Gary Lalhruaikima Zolat, 21, from Afula; and Staff Sgt. Ofir Eliyahu, 20, from Holon. The death toll among Israeli troops since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist massacre now stands at 793, according to IDF figures. Additionally, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

FBI captures suspect in leaked intel on IDF Iran-strike prep	Court documents said Rahman held a top-secret security clearance with access to sensitive compartmentalized information. By JNS A U.S. government employee has been arrested and charged for leaking secret files related to Israel’s preparations to retaliate for Iran’s Oct. 1 missile attacks, according to court documents filed on Wednesday. The suspect, identified as Asif William Rahman, was indicted last week on two counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information. FBI agents arrested Rahman in Cambodia on Tuesday. Rahman, who according to The New York Times 'worked abroad' for the CIA, is set to make his first court appearance in Guam later this week. Court documents said Rahman held a top-secret security clearance with access to sensitive compartmentalized information, which the Times noted is typical for CIA employees who handle classified documents. The Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed on Oct. 22 that the agency was investigating the leak. 'The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and intelligence community,' it said. The FBI is leading the probe, U.S. officials briefed on the matter told CNN. Investigators were said to have been working to authenticate the files and determine who could have had access to them, they said. This is 'one indication that, for now, the FBI and other investigators are working off the theory that the breach most likely came from a government insider and not from a cyber intrusion,' CNN reported. At least one of the files appears to have been scanned from an officially printed briefing book, and the pool of people who printed these pages would be relatively small, sources familiar with U.S. intelligence said. Then-Republican candidate for the White House Donald Trump on Oct. 22 slammed the Biden administration for the leak, calling it 'bad thing.' 'They leaked all the information about the way that Israel’s going to fight and how they are going to fight and where they are going to go. And somebody—who did that? Can you imagine somebody doing that? That’s the enemy. I guess that maybe is the enemy from within, as I talked about,' Trump said during the campaign event in Doral, Fla. 'We have an enemy from within,' the Republican continued. 'They hate to talk about it. Can you imagine? So we just can’t stand for this incompetence anymore.' U.S. President Joe Biden is 'deeply concerned' over the intelligence leak, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters a day earlier. 'That is not supposed to happen, and it’s unacceptable when it does,' he said, adding that the president 'will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened.' Kirby said that it is not yet known how the documents were leaked and that the Department of Defense continues to investigate the incident. 'We don’t have any indication at this point that there’s an expectation that there’ll be additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,' he added in response to a question from reporters. Axios noted on Oct. 19 that the leak may have been an attempt to 'disrupt' Jerusalem’s plans to retaliate against Tehran and revealed close spying by the U.S. on the Jewish state, including with satellites.

El Al’s monopoly over US flights ends as Israir enters market	Since the Gaza war erupted last year, direct flights between Israel and major international destinations have been in limbo. By Jewish Breaking News El Al’s monopoly over direct flights to the United States will soon come to an end as Israir is set to launch service to Newark Airport. The airline has initiated talks with US regulators and is negotiating to wet-lease two wide-body aircraft, aiming to begin operations during the upcoming winter season. While the airline has secured preliminary approval from Israel’s Transportation Ministry, the full regulatory process typically takes three months, with officials working to expedite security clearances and landing rights. 'I thank the Civil Aviation Authority for their thorough work that enables significant relief in the flight crisis created due to the war. Israeli companies are demonstrating national responsibility in their mobilization during this challenging period,' stated Transportation Minister Miri Regev. 'I commend Israir Airlines for their initiative to operate a New York route, a step that will contribute to healthy competition, expanded options for the public, and lower flight prices.' Since the Gaza war erupted last year, direct flights between Israel and major international destinations have been in limbo. American Airlines has suspended its Israel routes through September 2025, United Airlines halted services indefinitely, and Delta suspended operations through March 2025, leaving El Al as the sole carrier maintaining direct service. Currently, a select group of international carriers maintains service to Israel. Middle Eastern airlines Emirates, Fly Dubai, and Etihad operate daily flights, while European carriers including Tarom, Hi-Sky, Fly One, Cyprus Airways, and Smartwings continue their routes, as well as Ethiopian Airlines, Hainan Airlines, and Uzbekistan Airways. Among Israeli carriers, El Al, Arkia, and Israir operate to multiple international destinations, while Air Haifa limits its service to flights between Tel Aviv and Larnaca.

Kamala Harris campaign gave $500k to Al Sharpton’s nonprofit week...	The Harris campaign, which ended $20 million in debt, leaned heavily on celebrities, influencers, and other high-profile Harris backers to make her case to voters. By Chuck Ross, The Washington Free Beacon Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign donated $500,000 to Al Sharpton’s nonprofit organization just weeks before the anti-Semitic MSNBC host—who once said that 'diamond merchant' Jews have the 'blood of innocent babies' on their hands—conducted a friendly interview with Harris. The campaign’s remittance to Sharpton’s National Action Network was part of a flurry of donations—$5.4 million in all—to black and Latino advocacy groups that seem aimed at winning Harris support from those constituencies. Harris’s campaign gave two payments of $250,000 to National Action Network on Sept. 5 and Oct. 1, according to campaign finance records. On Oct. 3, Sharpton aired a video of Harris wishing him happy birthday on his MSNBC weekend show, PoliticsNation with Al Sharpton. 'Happy birthday, Rev,' Harris said, using Sharpton’s nickname. 'You have been over all of your years such an extraordinary leader. You have been a voice of truth, a voice of conscience.' Sharpton, 70, conducted a glowing interview with Harris on Oct. 20 in which he touted her 'extraordinary historic campaign' while referring to Trump as 'hostile and erratic.' His questions lined up closely with messages that Harris sought to highlight on the campaign trail. Sharpton addressed concerns among black voters—especially black men—about Harris’s record as a prosecutor in California, where she was given the nickname 'Kamala the Cop.' Sharpton brought up Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress, and one of Harris’s personal heroes, to put Harris’s candidacy in historical perspective. Sharpton asked Harris whether men who opposed her were 'misogynistic.' Sharpton did not disclose payments from the Harris campaign during either segment with the candidate. National Action Network did not respond to requests for comment. MSNBC also did not respond to comment requests. Harris’s donations to National Action Network and similar groups were part of a $1 billion spending spree that has sparked heartache and soul-searching within the Democratic Party, which lost the popular vote to a Republican candidate for the first time since 2004. The campaign, which ended $20 million in debt, leaned heavily on celebrities, influencers, and other high-profile Harris backers to make her case to voters. Her campaign gave $1 million to the production company of Oprah Winfrey, and paid a six-figure sum to create a set for Harris’s interview on the Call Her Daddy podcast, the Washington Examiner reported. Team Harris donated to the National Urban League ($2 million), the Black Economic Alliance ($150,000), and Black Church PAC ($150,000). The campaign gave donations to lesser-known groups like the Haitian Ladies Fund ($30,000) and International Free and Accepted Modern Masons ($150,000), a black freemasons organization, according to campaign finance disclosures. The Black Economic Alliance hosted a video call for 5,000 attendees days before the election to urge black men to vote for Harris. Vote to Live Action Fund, which received $275,000 from the Harris campaign, launched a $4 million initiative in October to pressure black men to vote. Harris spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on an initiative to appeal to black church voters. Two of the organizations, Black Church PAC and the Institute of Church Administration and Management ($250,000), are linked to Frederick Haynes, an anti-Israel pastor who has worked with Harris for years on liberal causes. The campaign gave to Casa in Action ($120,000), the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada ($105,000), and Somos Votantes ($120,000), to mobilize Latino voters in Nevada, Pennsylvania, and other swing states. The lavish giveaways seemingly failed given Harris’s historically poor performance with black and Latino voters. Sharpton reportedly earns a seven-figure salary from MSNBC, and is paid handsomely by National Action Network, which he founded in 1991. The nonprofit paid Sharpton around $650,000 in 2021 out of $7 million in revenues, and spent another $940,000 that year for 'transportation services' to the private jet firm Apollo Jets and the limousine company Carey International. It’s not the first time Sharpton has faced conflict of interest concerns regarding donations to his group, which he launched in 1991. The tobacco company R.J. Reynolds has donated heavily to Sharpton’s network. Sharpton, for his part, has publicly opposed a ban on menthol cigarettes, raising concerns that the activist preacher is being paid off to promote a harmful product popular with black Americans. Sharpton has become an influential figure in mainstream Democratic circles after rising to national prominence in the 1990s for his involvement in anti-Semitic causes. He once taunted Jews to 'pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house.' In 1991, he provoked the Crown Heights riots in Brooklyn, one of the worst anti-Semitic outbursts in American history.

‘A huge relief’: Israelis react as Trump’s foreign policy team ta...	These appointments sound like a lot of good news, and this is a huge relief,' Elena, a 43-year-old financial manager in Tel Aviv, told The Press Service of Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israelis expressed satisfaction and 'relief' on Wednesday as US President-elect Donald Trump’s foreign policy team began taking shape. Trump has nominated former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee as US Ambassador to Israel, New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik as Ambassador to the United Nations, Florida Congressman Mike Waltz as National Security Advisor, and Fox News host Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense. Florida Senator Marco Rubio is widely expected to be nominated for Secretary of State. 'These appointments sound like a lot of good news, and this is a huge relief,' Elena, a 43-year-old financial manager in Tel Aviv, told The Press Service of Israel. 'People are joking that if things continue to go this way, Israel will be sanctioned for not being Zionist enough. On the other side, what we see now is just putting the figures on the chess board. Now we’ll need to play this game for the next four years and actually use this advantage to build a new position for Israel in the Middle East. And we can not forget that the tables may turn in the next elections.' Sderot carpenter Shmuel Mimoun told TPS-IL, 'We are very very glad that Trump has been elected, and we hope very much that this will change the picture of victory in Gaza and the picture of victory in Lebanon, and the Jewish people will live in pride and freedom in the Promised land.' The 28-year-old added, 'With God’s help, Trump will help to extend Jewish sovereignty to Judea and Samaria, and to build settlements in Gaza.' Other Israelis were more cautious in their approval. 'Trump gives the impression of a businessman, and from that it follows that he will take a deal that will be good in his eyes. Given this, it is difficult to know how truly loyal he is to Israel,' said Jerusalem music teacher Itshak Vinokur. Jerusalem biologist Sharon Eden said she had 'mixed feelings' about Trump’s presidency. 'On one hand, I do hope Trump and his new appointments will help Israel, and it’s gonna strengthen the ties between the US and Israel. He chose people who support Israel. And if there were a different government in Israel, I would be totally happy with it,' Eden said. However, she added, 'With the government that we have here in Israel, I’m afraid it’s gonna be too homogeneous. There is no balance. I saw that Trump chose someone who supports the settlements, and I’m afraid that given [National Security Minister Itamar] Ben-Gvir and [Finance Minister Bezalel] Smotrich in the Israeli government, it can be too much.' Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20.

Israel hits Hezbollah assets in Beirut, ‘erasing two decades of b...	Secondary explosions resulted from the strikes, confirming that weapons were being stored at the sites, according to the IDF. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israel has destroyed most of Hezbollah’s weapons storage sites and missile production facilities in the group’s stronghold in Dahieh, a southern suburb of Beirut, the Israel Defense Forces said on Tuesday. In recent weeks, a series of Israeli aerial strikes have been carried out to dismantle the terror infrastructure as part of 'Operation Northern Arrows' in Lebanon. According to the army, these sites were established over the past two decades in residential areas, systematically concealed beneath civilian buildings. Secondary explosions resulted from the strikes, confirming that weapons were being stored at the sites, according to the IDF. The military emphasized that Hezbollah directly endangers the residents of the Lebanese capital by concealing large quantities of explosives under residential structures, often without residents’ knowledge. Over the past 20 years, the Hezbollah terrorist organization has established dozens of weapons production sites and storage facilities in the heart of the Dahieh district, the organization’s governing stronghold. These sites, systematically concealed beneath civilian buildings,… pic.twitter.com/V06dNhjNRZ &mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) November 12, 2024 In one example cited by the IDF, which it noted Israel had revealed at the United Nations General Assembly in 2020, a primary site was established in the heart of the Choueifat neighborhood beneath a complex of five residential buildings housing around 50 families, 85 meters from a school. 'This site was intended to produce various weapon components, including long-range precision missiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel. These missiles are a central element of Hezbollah’s precision missile project, funded by Iran,' the IDF said. The IDF also used the 2020 Beirut Port blast as an example of how Hezbollah places civilians in Beirut in mortal danger. In the Aug. 4 event, 2,750 tons of ammunition nitrate, a component used in Hezbollah’s weapon production process, exploded, causing massive destruction, killing 190 civilians and wounding thousands more. Reminder 1: we operate according to precise intelligence. Reminder 2: we exposed this missile production site 5 years ago, and warned the approx. 50 families living there to move away from the area. Today we can say this site has been dismantled. &mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) November 12, 2024 Overnight Tuesday, the Israeli Air Force continued the strikes on Hezbollah weapons storage facilities and command centers in the Dahieh area, and on Wednesday morning the IDF issued evacuation orders for Lebanese civilians near six buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs. The IDF stressed that many steps were taken before the strikes to minimize harm to the civilian population, including the issuing of advance warnings. מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר, בהכוונת אגף המודיעין תקפו במהלך הלילה מחסני אמצעי לחימה ומפקדות של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה במרחב הדאחייה שבביירות >> pic.twitter.com/09WhABaGab &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 13, 2024 IDF hits launchers used in Tuesday’s deadly attacks The IDF said on Wednesday morning that it struck the Hezbollah launchers in Lebanon used to fire 55 projectiles into Israel on Tuesday, one of which killed two people in the northern Israel city of Nahariya.

In addition, two people in their 30s sustained light wounds from rocket shrapnel in Kibbutz Kabri in the Western Galilee. Both victims were evacuated to Nahariya’s Galilee Medical Center for treatment. According to the IDF, approximately 10 rockets were fired from Lebanon, only some of which were intercepted. Earlier on Tuesday, a Hezbollah drone exploded in the yard of a kindergarten in the Haifa suburb of Nesher. There were no injuries reported and the impact caused minor damage. Israel’s Channel 12 News reported that despite no sirens sounding in Nesher, teachers decided to evacuate the children to a protected area, thereby saving their lives. Also on Tuesday, Hezbollah fired three ballistic missiles at central Israel, temporarily halting air traffic at Ben-Gurion International Airport. All three missiles were intercepted. Overnight Tuesday and on Wednesday morning, three drones launched from Lebanon and Iraq were intercepted by Israel’s air defenses. On Wednesday afternoon, 20 rockets were fired from Lebanon at the Western and Upper Galilee, according to the IDF. Most of the projectiles were intercepted, with some impacts recorded. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Over the past 24 hours, the IAF struck over 120 Hezbollah and Hamas targets in Lebanon and in Gaza. Halevi to reserve fighters: ‘The IDF is working very hard’ IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi visited troops in Southern Lebanon for a situational assessment on Tuesday alongside commanding officers, telling the reserve forces that 'The IDF is working very hard—attacking in Beirut, in Dahieh, [deep in Lebanon], and in Syria.' הרמטכ״ל ללוחמי המילואים בדרום לבנון: ״צה״ל עובד חזק מאוד - תוקפים בביירות בדאחייה, בעומק ובסוריה״ pic.twitter.com/zQXe8dVtvU &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 12, 2024 Halevi emphasized that the Israeli attacks in Lebanon have taken 'significant command and combat capabilities' from Hezbollah. 'The IDF is simultaneously operating very strongly, we struck heavily against Hezbollah targets in Beirut, the Dahieh, and other locations,' the army chief said. 'We are conducting deep strikes and striking frequently in Syria and along the Syria-Lebanon border to prevent weapons transfers to Hezbollah. Clearing this area will provide the basic conditions to do things correctly in order to really ensure that the valley below is secure,' he said. Four Hezbollah commanders killed in recent IDF strikes The IDF reported Wednesday that four senior Hezbollah operatives, including three field commanders and the leader of the group’s anti-tank missile unit, were killed in recent Israeli strikes in Lebanon.

Nabulsi had been designated as the successor to Muhammad Khalil Alian, who was killed late last month in an Israeli strike on the village of Burj Qallawiyah in Southern Lebanon. Earlier, at the beginning of October, the IAF carried out an operation that eliminated Muhammad Musa Salah, Hezbollah’s commander in the Khiam area. Salah had directed attacks against Israel and was responsible for firing over 2,500 projectiles targeting the Golan Heights, Upper Galilee, Galilee panhandle, and IDF positions in Southern Lebanon. In additional precision strikes, the IDF also eliminated Hezbollah’s commander in the Ghajar area and Hajj Ali Yussef Salah, who served as the group’s commander in Tebnit. 'This further degrades Hezbollah’s capability to carry out terror attacks from southern Lebanon against Israeli civilians on the northern border,' the IDF said. 'The IDF will continue to operate to thwart any danger or threat against the State of Israel.'

Report: Trump’s victory has forced Iran to delay attack on Israel	Iranian officials say Tehran has shelved plans to attack Israel in response for October 26th strikes, after Trump defeated Kamala Harris in this month's election. By World Israel News Staff The Iranian government has decided to postpone its planned attack on Israel following former President and President-elect Donald Trump's election in the November 5th vote, according to a report Wednesday afternoon. Citing multiple Iranian sources, Sky News Arabia reported that Tehran has backed off its plans for a major strike on Israel for the time being. Iranian officials had dubbed the planned attack 'Operation True Promise 3,' as it would mark the third major direct attack by Iran on Israel this year. On April 13th, Iran launched roughly 120 cruise and ballistic missiles towards Israel, along with a number of suicide drones. Iran again struck Israel on October 1st, launching some 180 ballistic missiles. Israel retaliated on October 26th, striking Iran's missile defense network with over 100 warplanes. Following Israel's retaliatory strike, Brig. Gen. Ali Mohammed Naeini, spokesman for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, vowed that Iran would respond to what he dubbed the 'new evil act.' 'The response to the recent Zionist aggression against Iran will be inevitable, decisive and beyond the enemy's awareness,' Naeini said. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also declared publicly that his country would respond 'harshly' for the October 26th retaliatory strikes, suggesting that both the U.S. and Israel would be targeted 'for what they are doing against Iran and the axis of resistance.' Now, however, Iranian sources claimed that Tehran has 'postponed the implementation of Operation True Promise 3 against Israel after Trump's victory.' The sources added that the retaliation was shelved but not permanently nixed, saying that it would be put back on the table after Tehran has an opportunity to engage with the incoming administration. 'The Iranian response against Israel is postponed until negotiations with President Trump begin.'

Islamic Jihad releases new footage of Israeli captive	Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group releases third psychological warfare video featuring 29-year-old captive Alexander Sasha Trufanov. By World Israel News Staff The Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group has released a new video featuring hostage Alexander Sasha Trufanov, marking the third such clip of him since his abduction. The timing of the video’s recording remains unclear, though Trufanov identifies himself as 28 years old in the footage. Notably, the release comes just two days after Trufanov turned 29, having now spent two birthdays in captivity. Trufanov, an engineer at Annapurna Labs, an Israeli microelectronics firm owned by Amazon, was taken hostage alongside three family members — his grandmother Irena Tati, mother Yelena (Lena) Trufanova, and girlfriend Sapir Cohen — during the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz. Trufanov's father was murdered during the invasion. While Tati and Trufanova were released on November 29th as a gesture to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Cohen was freed the next day during a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Trufanov remains in captivity. The video’s release highlights what Israeli authorities describe as psychological warfare, a tactic frequently employed by terror groups. Before his abduction, Trufanov had recently moved with Cohen to an apartment in Ramat Gan, leaving his friends unaware he was visiting family in the Gaza border community at the time of the massacre. Hamas politburo deputy chief Mousa Abu Marzouk has previously indicated that Trufanov and another hostage with Russian citizenship, Maxim Herkin, would be prioritized for release in a future deal, though no concrete timeline has been provided. Following the release of the video Wednesday, Trufanov's mother, Yelena, said she was 'relieved' to see her son alive, while lamenting that she is 'very worried to hear what he is saying. I urge that every effort be made to secure his immediate release and that of all other hostages. They have no time left.'

US won’t impose arms embargo on Israel over Gaza aid	Biden administration says Israel only partially in compliance with demands to expand entry of Gaza aid and end isolation of northern Gaza, but indicates no arms embargo will be imposed. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The deadline imposed by the Biden administration on Israel to comply with its demands to expand the entry of aid to the Gaza Strip and to reduce the use of mass evacuation orders in the coastal enclave expired Wednesday, with the White House appearing to back down from a possible confrontation with Jerusalem over American weapons sales. On October 13th, senior American officials penned a memorandum to Israeli leaders setting out an ultimatum with a 30-day deadline, insisting that Jerusalem take steps to increase the flow of aid to the Gaza Strip, to reduce the use of mass evacuation orders in Gaza, and to reduce the isolation of the northern Gaza Strip, where IDF forces are currently operating to crush a Hamas insurgency. On Tuesday, State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said that while Israel had not, in the administration's determination, fulfilled all 15 of the demands issued in the October 13th memo, the U.S. has not 'made an assessment that there that the Israelis are in violation of US law.' Previously, the Biden administration had intimated that failure by Israel to comply with the memo would result in restrictions on arms transfers. Patel cited a number of steps taken by the Israeli government since October 13th to conform with the Biden administration's demands. 'Over the past 30 days, Israel has taken a number of steps to address the measures laid out in the letter that Secretaries Blinken and Austin sent earlier in October,' Patel said. 'We continue to be in discussion with our partners in Israel about these steps that they have taken, which they took as a result of U.S. intervention, as well as additional steps that we feel that still need to be taken.' 'Specifically, we have seen the reopening of the Erez crossing. We have seen a new crossing at Kissufim open. As it relates to the Jordanian armed forces corridor, we have seen a waivement of certain customs requirement that humanitarian organizations had previously said was an obstacle.' 'We’ve also seen the expansion of the Mawasi humanitarian zone, and we have seen the institution of periodic operational pauses.' Patel acknowledged that the flow of aid into Gaza remains below the 350-truck per day goal set by the Biden administration, though the rate has increased since the memo, rising from an average of 37 trucks per day to 45.

After Iranian assassination attempt, Netanyahu relocates to bunke...	The move was made after a UAV hit his home in Caesarea last month. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been working in a bunker in the basement of his office in Jerusalem since his home in Caesarea was hit by a UAV last month, Channel 12 reported Sunday. Although he and his family weren’t in the house at the time and the building only suffered minor exterior damage from the Hezbollah-sent drone, security around the prime minister was tightened due to the obvious threat. Usually, Netanyahu works with his senior aides in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) in what is known as the 'aquarium' due to its glass walls. It is a sterile area on an upper floor in the government’s Jerusalem building complex. Cabinet meetings that usually took place in the PMO were also moved to the basement’s fortified room. As this is smaller than the office, the ministers were told that they could not bring their usual aides along anymore. The Shin Bet internal security agency also recommended that he should not stay in fixed locations. This may be another reason behind Netanyahu’s lawyers’ request to the court Tuesday that his corruption trials be postponed for two and a half months. The defense is supposed to begin its counterattack on December 2nd, and Netanyahu is going to need to attend court. Doing so on a known basis a few times a week could make planning an attack on him much easier. The public reasons given by the lawyers include Netanyahu’s need for more time prepare his defense due to the long hours he spends on the ongoing war – and that the court building has no safe room or bomb shelter. The State Attorney’s Office has objected to the request, as the cases have dragged on since 2020 and 'Beginning the case for the defense at the set time is necessary in order to protect the public interest, the fairness of the process, and the fundamental principle that everyone is equal before the law.' Netanyahu reportedly cited the security issue outright when discussing recently the idea of postponing his son Avner’s wedding, which was supposed to take place on November 26th. Kan News reported that he had told confidantes that he was worried about the safety of attendees at the festivities that were to be held in Tel Aviv. 'For missiles, we have good detection and interception systems,' he reportedly said, in seeming contrast to the UAVs Hezbollah has launched at Israel. The Iranian terror proxy has been firing many more drones, and at at longer ranges, over recent months than at the beginning of the war. Their more erratic flight path makes them more difficult to track and several have slipped through the IDF’s aerial defenses, killing and injuring dozens of civilians and soldiers, including twelve Druze children in the Golan Heights town of Majdal Shams in one July attack alone. Avner Netanyahu and his partner, Amit Yardeni, who have been together for the last two years, decided to push off their nuptials until next summer.

America’s next ambassador to Israel backs annexation of Judea and...	Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee vows to do 'anything' he can to further the goal of applying Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee appeared to endorse Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to apply sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria, after he tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel. On Tuesday, Trump announced his selection of Huckabee, who is expected to be formally nominated shortly after Trump takes office on January 20th. Huckabee's nomination will then be brought before the Senate, which under the incoming Republican majority is expected to quickly confirm the appointment. A day later, Israel's Galey Tzahal radio channel aired an interview with Huckabee in which the former governor and Fox News host responded to the news of his selection as ambassador. 'I am still in a bit of a shock,' Huckabee said. 'This is a wonderful appointment. I am incredibly honored that the President asked me to serve in this capacity. There are still so many things that I am not yet aware of in terms of timing, but on a personal level, this is a wonderful opportunity to serve my country.' 'I visited Israel in 1973, almost 53 years ago and since then I have made dozens of trips to the country. I have taken tens of thousands of Americans to visit Israel and it has been an amazing honor.' Huckabee added that while as ambassador he does not have discretion regarding American policy vis-a-vis Israel, he would 'anything' he can to help promote efforts to extend Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. 'I have been a frequent visitor to Judea and Samaria and I believe that there is a chance of applying Israeli sovereignty to the region,' Huckabee said. 'I also very much believe that the people of Israel deserve a secure and safe country and I will do anything I can that will help and accommodate this goal.' 'Of course, I will not be the one to make the policy, but I will carry out the president’s policy. But there has never been a U.S. president who has been more helpful in ensuring the sovereignty of Israel. No one has done more for Israel, including recognition of the Golan Heights, than President Trump.' A long-time supporter of Israel and the settlement movement in Judea and Samaria, Huckabee has in the past rejected the two-state solution and seemingly endorsed the voluntary transfer of Palestinian Arabs out of the area. In February 2011, Huckabee suggested that Palestinian Arabs be resettled in 'a territory that [is] in the hands of Muslims, in the hands of Arabs.' According to a report by Kan Reshet Bet, Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu has privately reassured senior government ministers that he will resume efforts to apply Israeli sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria. The plans were first drawn up in 2019, but shelved in 2020 as part of the Abraham Accords.

Trump picks Fox host, Army vet Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defe...	Hegseth’s selection was unexpected, even among those close to Trump’s inner circle. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Donald Trump has tapped Army combat veteran and Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his next defense secretary, the president-elect announced Tuesday. Hegseth, who earned two bronze stars from combat tours, served as a platoon leader at the Guantanamo Bay naval facility and fought in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He is a longtime Trump stalwart who was once tipped to run the Veterans Affairs Department during the president’s first term in office. Hegseth’s selection was unexpected, even among those close to Trump’s inner circle. Prominent Republican foreign policy hawks—such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo—were initially named as potential candidates, along with former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a favorite among isolationists. 'Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First,' Trump said in a statement announcing his pick. 'With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice—Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down.' Hegseth is a Princeton University graduate who also holds a graduate degree from Harvard University. He is known for his appearances on the Fox News channel over the past decade and hosts the network’s Fox & Friends Weekend. It is unclear how the Senate, which will need to confirm Hegseth once its new Republican majority is sworn in, will receive his surprise nomination. Trump also announced on Tuesday evening that former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe will serve as the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In a third statement, he tapped Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a 'Department of Government Efficiency.'

Israeli doctoral student uncovers the resilience of Gaza border c...	Surprisingly, she found that despite the widespread trauma, a significant level of community resilience emerged, albeit with varying levels of coping based on factors such as age, gender, and personal experience. By Pesach Benson, TPS For doctoral student Nitzan Eilon, the Hamas attacks of October 7 hit close to home — terrorists were caught in her garden at Moshav Netiv Ha’asara. She was saved thanks to quick action by the community’s civilian security squad. But 20 moshav residents were killed that day and for many of Eilon’s neighbors, the trauma still lingers. Eilon, a doctoral student in the Conflict Management and Resolution program at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, found herself compelled to research the long-term effects of the attacks on her neighbors, seeking to understand how the residents of the western Negev have been coping. 'The unique focus of the current research is how one’s personality style which begins to develop in infancy, combined with a sense of coherence, trust in the army and community resilience, help people cope and begin to recover from the events of October 7,' Eilon said. 'Alongside the findings of the sense of coherence and the high community resilience that we discovered, the fact that we are still in the midst of a war, the hostages have not yet returned and there are many more evacuees, it is imperative to continue to examine the struggle in its various stages,' she added. As part of her doctoral research, Eilon surveyed approximately 600 residents from the western Negev communities, ages 18-91, to assess how they were managing the emotional stress. Guided by Prof. Orna Braun-Lewensohn, Eilon explored stress reactions and the resilience of residents in the aftermath of the attack. Surprisingly, she found that despite the widespread trauma, a significant level of community resilience emerged, albeit with varying levels of coping based on factors such as age, gender, and personal experience. One key finding was the relatively high levels of community resilience reported across the sample. On a scale measuring resilience, the average score was 3.54 out of 7, indicating that most residents showed an ability to adapt and endure despite the ongoing crisis. Additionally, a sense of coherence — defined as the belief that life has meaning and can be understood — was reported to be similarly strong, with an average score of 4.44 out of 7. However, trust in the Israeli army was lower, with an average score of just 2.33 out of 5, suggesting a sense of uncertainty among the population regarding their security. According to the survey, 83% of respondents were at home on October 7, and nearly half (45%) experienced the infiltration of terrorists firsthand. Furthermore, 52% had close friends or family members who were killed, kidnapped, or wounded during the attack. Despite this, the resilience of the community as a whole was notable, with respondents often citing the importance of social support networks, the sense of unity, and shared identity as key factors in their ability to cope. Eilon’s research also examined differences between the founding members of the communities — many of whom were the first generation to settle in these areas — and their younger counterparts. While resilience levels were high across all groups, founders of the settlements exhibited a distinctively higher level of resilience compared to younger residents. The study also revealed significant differences in stress responses between different age groups. Younger residents, particularly those between the ages of 18-30, experienced the highest levels of anxiety and distress. In contrast, older adults, particularly those aged 61 and above, reported lower levels of psychological distress, suggesting that younger individuals may have fewer coping mechanisms in place. Gender differences were also apparent in the study’s findings. Women reported higher levels of psychological distress and lower quality of life compared to men. Women’s distress scores averaged 2.38, compared to 1.99 for men. Additionally, women were more likely to rely on emotional coping strategies, such as seeking help from others and receiving emotional support. These strategies, while important, also suggested that women were more emotionally affected by the attacks. Eilon and Braun-Lewensohn emphasize that the struggle is far from over. With many challenges still ahead, including the ongoing war and the return of hostages, it is critical to continue monitoring the psychological impact of the conflict and provide support to all affected groups. 'We must ensure that all population groups manage to cope, recover, and grow anew,' said Braun-Lewensohn. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hezbollah may want to cover up such losses as it weakens its image as Iran’s terror proxy crown jewel of resistance,' Jason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) stated. By Jack Elbaum, The Algemeiner Since the war between Israel and Hezbollah began to escalate this September, the Iran-backed Lebanese terrorist organization has stopped announcing its casualties through public relations channels. Experts tell The Algemeiner this is likely because of the breakdown of Hezbollah’s command and control structure or in order to help control narratives around the conflict. Rather than death notices being published by Hezbollah itself — as was the case from October 2023 to September 2024 — terrorist deaths have mainly been reported by open intelligence sources based on funeral notices and social media posts. Israeli assessments suggest that over 2,000 Hezbollah fighters have been killed since October 2023, said Jason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI). This number includes upwards of 1,000 terrorists killed since the situation in northern Israel, which borders Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Lebanon, began to escalate just under two months ago. Brodsky’s approximate number is somewhat supported by at least one open-source intelligence gatherer who has identified almost 1,500 Hezbollah casualties as of Nov. 11, 2024, primarily using funeral notices found on local social media channels. This includes about 900 deaths since September. Experts estimate the number of Hezbollah fighters wounded to be three or four times higher than the death count, including the thousands of Hezbollah fighters injured in Israel’s pager attack in September, when communications devices used by the terrorists exploded simultaneously across Lebanon. Hezbollah is widely considered to have a pre-war fighting force of around 20,000-25,000 militiamen working full-time, with tens of thousands more in the reserves. Hezbollah has good reason, experts say, to hide its true casualty numbers as the terrorist organization appears to still be suffering from command-and-control disruptions due to Israeli military pressure. As a result, Hezbollah has been forced to use guerilla tactics rather than operating as a coherent military force. While Israel has suffered almost 100 civilian and military casualties in its offensive against Hezbollah, along with relentless rocket fire and drone attacks from the Islamist organization on the country’s north — and at times, in the heart of Tel Aviv — the level of damage to Israel’s home front and critical infrastructure has been far less than expected. Max Abrahms, professor of international relations at Northeastern University, explained that terrorist groups such as Hezbollah often lie. 'Sometimes they conceal information about their own losses,' he said. 'The reason why they do that,' Abrahms continued, 'is because they want to create the perception that they’re more successful than they really are. And terrorist groups very often have to do that because, in general, terrorist groups are losers.' Over the past few months, Israel has decimated the leadership of Hezbollah, with almost its entire top level of command being killed — including Hassan Nasrallah, its longtime leader. Israel has long been worried that a war with Hezbollah could result in massive losses for the Jewish state, as the Lebanese terror group reportedly had more than 120,000 rockets over various ranges in its arsenal, primarily sponsored by Iran. Israeli estimates suggest Hezbollah now retains only 20 percent of its missile arsenal and that Israel has eliminated 70 percent of its drone arsenal, according to Brodsky. 'Hezbollah may want to cover up such losses as it weakens its image as Iran’s terror proxy crown jewel of resistance,' Brodsky added. Elliott Abrams, senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former White House deputy national security adviser, agreed. 'The usual terrorist pattern is to exaggerate the number of civilian casualties and deny the number of terrorists killed,' he said. 'This is done to mask the impact of Israeli strikes on armed Hezbollah men and keep up Hezbollah morale.' After Israel’s pager attack, air and ground campaign, and targeted assassinations of Hezbollah leaders, the group is struggling to keep up its rocket fire and military operations against Israel. At the same time, Hezbollah may still be able to manufacture weapons. 'Hezbollah may still have capacity to manufacture missiles and drones in Lebanon proper, and that’s not to mention ongoing Iranian attempts to ship weapons and supplies,' Abrams said. 'But, those corridors have become more restricted with Israel’s operations.'

Trump nominates Jewish businessman, close friend as special Middl...	Steve will be an unrelenting voice for peace, and make us all proud,' said Donald Trump. By JNS President-elect Donald Trump named Steven Witkoff, a longtime close friend and Jewish businessman, whom he called a 'highly respected leader in business and philanthropy,' as his special Middle East envoy. 'Another great call. Steve is a brilliant businessman and a lover of Israel who will receive a warm welcome throughout the halls of power within the Middle East,' wrote David Friedman, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel. Witkoff, who is chairman and CEO of an eponymous firm that he founded in 1997, 'has made every project and community he has been involved with stronger and more prosperous,' Trump stated. 'Steve will be an unrelenting voice for peace, and make us all proud.' The businessman 'has leveraged his extensive real estate expertise to successfully lead the financing, repositioning and construction of over 70 properties in major business districts in the U.S. as well as abroad and with offices in New York, Los Angeles and Miami,' the president-elect added. He noted that Witkoff has also practiced law in addition to working in real estate and has served on the Real Estate Board of New York’s executive committee and the board of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation. He also chairs the real estate advisory board of the Miami Business School, is a trustee at Hofstra University and has been a trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Witkoff, who was born in the Bronx, has been a major donor to Trump’s political action groups and was, as a lawyer, among Trump’s early clients. A 1999 profile in the Observer referred to Witkoff as 'a spare, knifelike man who keeps a copy of the book Tough Jews on his desk and used to carry a gun while collecting rents uptown.' 'President-elect Trump has nominated Gov. Huckabee as ambassador to Israel. American Jewish Committee looks forward to working with Gov. Huckabee and newly appointed special envoy for the Middle East Steven Witkoff to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship, bolster Israel-diaspora relations, and promote strong connections between American Jewry and Israel,' stated Ted Deutch, CEO of the AJC.

Mossad warns of Thailand terror plots targeting Israeli tourists	Iran and its proxies have intensified their efforts to harm Israeli and Jewish targets around the world,' said the Mossad in a statement. By World Israel News Staff Israel's Mossad intelligence agency warned Israeli tourists in Thailand to avoid a world-famous outdoor party this weekend, saying that the event may be targeted by terrorists attempting to murder Israelis. The Mossad confirmation of an immediate, credible threat comes after Thai police urged Israelis not to attend the November 15th Full Moon Party on the island of Koh Phangan, a popular destination for Israeli tourists. In 'recent months, Israeli security services in cooperation with Thai security have acted to thwart several incidents' in the country, read a joint statement between the Mossad and National Security Council (NSC). 'Since October 7 and the war [in Gaza], Iran and its proxies have intensified their efforts to harm Israeli and Jewish targets around the world,' the statement said. Israel's NSC issued a travel advisory, telling tourists to avoid southern Thailand and for those already in the country to avoid gatherings with large numbers of Israelis, Jewish centers such as Chabad houses, and to hide external symbols of their Jewish and Israeli identity. 'From my experience, Israelis are not easily rattled,' Erez Roth, a travel agent based on the Thai island of Ko Samui, told Ynet. 'But maybe this year, certainly after the attacks in Amsterdam, Israelis should avoid crowded gatherings.' The warning comes as anti-Israel sentiment has peaked across the world, with a number of high-profile violent incidents and thwarted terror plots focused on Israeli tourists. In late October, Israel warned its citizens traveling in Sri Lanka to hunker down in their hotels until they could leave the country, citing an imminent terror threat. Last week, Muslim gangs in Amsterdam attacked Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer fans who had traveled to the city, leaving five hospitalized. Israeli authorities have also urged Israelis to avoid the upcoming soccer match between the French and Israeli national teams, which will be held in France.

‘Don’t lose hope, fight the regime’ – Netanyahu to Iranians	Netanyahu used the Farsi phrase 'zan, zandegi, azadi' (women, life, freedom) - a common refrain during the demonstrations. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the Iranian people to overthrow the Islamic Regime in an English-language statement video on Tuesday evening. 'Yet there’s one thing Khamenei’s regime fears more than Israel. You know what it is? It’s you — the people of Iran. That’s why they spend so much time and money trying to crush your hopes and curb your dreams,' Netanyahu said, referencing protests to overthrow the Islamic government that were brutally suppressed by Iranian authorities. While speaking, Netanyahu used the Farsi phrase 'zan, zandegi, azadi' (women, life, freedom) - a common refrain during the demonstrations. 'The regime wants to destroy your future as they seek to destroy our state. Well, we won’t let that happen. I have no doubt that one day in a free Iran, Israelis and Iranians will build together a future of prosperity and peace,' he said. A special message from me to the Iranian people: there’s one thing Khamenei’s regime fears more than Israel. It’s you — the people of Iran. Don’t lose hope. پیام ویژه‌ای از من برای مردم ایران: یک چیز هست که رژیم خامنه‌ای بیش از اسرائیل از آن می‌ترسد. آن شما هستید — مردم ایران.… pic.twitter.com/iADxSjNXCs &mdash; Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) November 12, 2024 '‎‏That is the future Israel deserves. That is the future Iran deserves. Together, let us turn this beautiful dream into a reality.' Netanyahu said that Iran's October 1st attack on Israel had caused 'marginal damage' to the Jewish State, but cost Tehran billions of dollars. The premier noted that those funds could have been spent on infrastructure improvements, education, healthcare, and other initiatives that would have benefited the Iranian people. Netanyahu hinted that another attack by Iran against Israel would result in a counter-attack that would cost Tehran dearly, in what may be a reference to Israel potentially striking Iranian oil assets. Iran's rulers 'obsess about destroying Israel, rather than about building Iran. What a shame,' Netanyahu said. 'Another attack on Israel would simply cripple Iran’s economy. It would rob you of many more billions of dollars.' He stressed that Iran adopting a democratic, non-Islamic form of government is possible. ‎‏'Imagine how your children’s lives would look if billions of dollars were invested in them instead of being wasted on wars that can’t be won. They would receive world-class education. You would receive beautiful roads. Advanced hospitals. Clean water,' Netanyahu said. 'You know, Israel has the world’s most advanced desalination system and we’d be happy to help rebuild Iran’s collapsing water infrastructure. These and so many other things are the things that you could have.'

President-elect Trump names Mike Huckabee as US ambassador to Isr...	Huckabee 'loves Israel and the people of Israel and likewise, the people of Israel love him,' Trump declared. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump announced that the 'great public servant, governor, and leader in faith for many years' and 'highly respected' Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, will be the U.S. ambassador to Israel during the next administration. Huckabee 'loves Israel and the people of Israel and likewise, the people of Israel love him,' Trump stated. 'Mike will work tirelessly to bring about peace in the Middle East.' A Southern Baptist pastor and governor for more than a decade, Huckabee sought the Republican nomination for president in 2008 and 2016. A staunch supporter of the Jewish state on biblical beliefs, the former governor has visited Israel many times and led thousands of U.S. Christians on solidarity tours over the past half-century. His first trip to Israel right out of high school was just before the 1973 Yom Kippur war. Huckabee backed the relocation of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and has worked to fight attempts by the BDS movement to isolate Israel. In the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist massacre in southern Israeli towns, Huckabee led evangelical leaders on a visit to the hard-hit communities along the border with the Gaza Strip. 'After 50 years of coming here, nothing has prepared me for this visit,' he said after walking through the charred remains of a border kibbutz. He told JNS at the time that the ignorance so many Americans display about the war was a searing indictment of the educational system, which indoctrinates college students with a warped worldview. In August 2018, Huckabee laid a ceremonial brick at the Israeli city of Efrat in Judea and said he might one day buy a 'holiday home' there. 'If President Trump could be here today, he’d be a very happy man,' he stated at the time, standing in front of a red sign that said 'Build Israel Great Again.' The Republican Jewish Coalition is 'thrilled' with the nomination. 'As a man of deep faith, we know Gov. Huckabee’s abounding love of Israel and its people is second to none,' the RJC said. 'As the Jewish state continues to fight an existential war for survival against Iran and its terrorist proxies, Gov. Huckabee will represent America’s ironclad commitment to Israel’s security with distinction.' David Friedman, who served as the U.S. envoy to Israel during Trump’s first presidency and was reportedly under consideration for the role again, stated that Huckabee is 'a dear friend and he will have my full support. 'Congrats Mike on getting the best job in the world,' Friedman wrote. 'It speaks volumes to the importance and priority that President Trump places on the U.S.-Israel relationship that he selected his ambassador to Israel within one week of his election,' Friedman added. 'The selection itself—Mike Huckabee is one of Israel’s greatest friends—tells us that the days of public daylight between the U.S. and Israel are about to end.'

Report: US leaked Saudi-Israel peace deal right before Hamas mass...	Sonnenfeld – who helped shape the original Abraham Accords under the Trump administration – described the official as a habitual over-sharer who acted out of arrogance rather than malice. By Jewish Breaking News The US National Security Council may have inadvertently provoked Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel through a diplomatic leak. In an interview on Iran International’s Eye for Iran podcast, academic Jeff Sonnenfeld revealed that a senior deputy to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan allegedly disclosed sensitive details about imminent Saudi-Israeli peace negotiations just days before the massacre. The leak reportedly occurred at a crucial moment when Saudi Arabia was poised to join the Abraham Accords, potentially transforming Middle Eastern geopolitics. According to Sonnenfeld, the unnamed official 'stuck a finger in the eye of Hamas' through his indiscreet revelations on October 5 or 6, prompting the terrorist group to act before the historic agreement could be finalized. While Sullivan’s office has firmly denied these allegations, Sonnenfeld – who helped shape the original Abraham Accords under the Trump administration – described the official as a habitual over-sharer who acted out of arrogance rather than malice. 'There is one deputy in there that, you name the crisis from the Middle East to Central Europe, this guy can’t stop talking. He’s beyond naive. It is his negligence and malpractice in office, but he’s rather full of himself and quite a dandy on top of that,' Sonnenfeld said. 'It would have been amazing, but by tempting fate like that, Hamas realized this was their last moment to strike.' During the interview, Sonnenfeld also praised President Joe Biden, who inherited the Abraham Accords from his predecessors, for not reversing it, and noted that the president privately acknowledged how close they had been to securing Saudi Arabia’s signature on the peace agreement. Sonnenfeld characterized the leak as 'an ill-timed irritant' that contributed to derailing one of the most significant diplomatic initiatives in recent Middle Eastern history, though he stopped short of directly attributing Hamas’s actions to the disclosure.

Kibbutz Nir Oz votes to rebuild following Oct. 7 destruction	In December, Israel’s Cabinet approved the outline for a strategic five years and up to 18 billion shekel plan to rehabilitate and develop the Gaza-adjacent region and its population. By JNS A majority of Kibbutz Nir Oz members voted on Monday to return to their destroyed homes and rebuild. The kibbutz was among the hardest hit communities during Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of southern Israel. One in four residents was either killed or kidnapped, including the Bibas family, mother Shiri, husband Yarden and their two children, Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 9 months old. In a letter to the government, the kibbutz members stressed their expectations for a large-scale and generous construction plan, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. In May, Israel Defense Forces Brig. Gen. Moshe Edri, the head of the government body overseeing the rehabilitation of the Gaza border region, said residents of Be’eri, Nir Oz and Kfar Aza would only be able to return home in two to three years. Edri said that residents of those communities would be set up in temporary housing until then. In December, Israel’s Cabinet approved the outline for a strategic multi-year plan to rehabilitate and develop the Gaza-adjacent region and its population. The plan comprises a broad budgetary framework for five years (2024-2028) of up to 18 billion shekels ($4.9 billion). Following the Oct. 7 massacre, all residents within seven kilometers of the Gaza border were evacuated. In January, the IDF Home Front Command allowed the partial return of some communities, including those of Kibbutz Bror Hayil, Kibbutz Dorot, Kibbutz Gvar’am, Moshav Mavki’im, Moshav Yakhini and Kibbutz Yad Mordechai.

Israel opens new Gaza border crossing to facilitate aid deliverie...	The outgoing Biden administration gave Israel a November 12 deadline to take specific measures to address northern Gaza’s humanitarian situation. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli authorities opened a new border crossing with Gaza on Tuesday to facilitate humanitarian aid deliveries. The crossing was opened 'in accordance with the directive of the political echelon, and as part of the effort and commitment to increase the amount and routes of aid to the Gaza Strip,' said Israel’s Coordinator for Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which coordinates civilian issues between the Israeli government, military, international community and the Palestinian Authority in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip. Trucks carrying food, water, medical equipment and equipment for shelters were inspected at the nearby Kerem Shalom Crossing before passing through Kissufim. The items are destined for southern and central Gaza. Meanwhile, hundreds of food and water packages were delivered to the northern Gaza areas of Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, where Hamas is trying to re-establish itself, Israeli authorities said on Tuesday. The deliveries come amid a dispute with Washington over aid. The outgoing Biden administration gave Israel a November 12 deadline to take specific measures to address northern Gaza’s humanitarian situation. Israeli officials are also trying to head off the United Nations from declaring a famine in northern Gaza. A declaration would trigger restrictions on American military aid to Israel, with other countries likely to follow suit. The declaration would be based on the findings of the UN’s Famine Review Committee, which assesses famine conditions. The FRC issued an emergency alert on Friday, claiming 'a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip,' and that 'immediate action, within days not weeks, is required.' The Israel Defense Forces rejected the alert, saying it was based on 'partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests.' An Israeli health emergency expert explained to The Press Service of Israel on Monday that there is no limit to the amount of aid could be delivered to the Strip. 'The amount of food trucks is determined by the amount that the donors send,' Dr. Dorit Nitzan, director of Ben Gurion University’s master’s program in Emergency Medicine, Preparedness and Response, told TPS-IL. 'The only thing that COGAT does is go through the items and don’t allow anything that has dual use.' Nitzan, who also held senior positions at the World Health Organization for 17 years, stressed that the number of trucks entering the Strip 'is determined entirely by the amount of donations provided for Gaza minus those that don’t pass the security check. Some 97% is allowed in, from the Israeli side.' She added that the safety of the checkpoint can also be a factor, but more often than not, the greater danger is Hamas and associated criminal groups hijacking the trucks. 'The big obstacles are the access and utilization of food from the Gazan side,' Nitzan said. Nitzan participated in a study by several Israeli institutions which concluded that Hamas posed the biggest threat to Gaza’s food security by hijacking food deliveries and firing rockets at border crossings where aid transfers take place. When Hamas slashed food prices in April, Gaza residents told The Press Service of Israel that the problem wasn’t a lack of food but a shortage of money for families to purchase it. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Israel’s AI sector outpaces global rivals, defying adversity	Israel’s number of active AI companies has jumped from 779 in 2014 to 2,170 in 2023, according to the study. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Israel’s AI sector is experiencing significant growth despite the ongoing war, positioning the country as a global leader in AI innovation, according to a report released on Tuesday. 'Israel stands at the forefront of global AI innovation, propelled by an extraordinary ecosystem of startups, academia, and multinational support,' said Avi Hasson, CEO of Startup Nation Central (SNC), which released the report. SNC is a Tel Aviv-based non-profit that promotes Israeli startups and innovation. According to the report’s findings, Israeli AI startups have demonstrated 173% growth since 2014, far outpacing the 12% increase in non-AI startups. While AI accounts for only 30% of Israel’s startups, they receive 47% of total company funding and representing 40% of the funding rounds in Israel. 'Since 2018, Israel’s AI investment share has typically been 3-4 times higher than Europe and the U.S.,' the report said. Although recent investments in U.S. AI companies have slightly narrowed the gap, the report also noted that key multinational tech giants, including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, and Apple, have strengthened the country’s startup ecosystem with significant investments in Israel. This strategic backing from global tech players supports Israel’s growing influence in AI, particularly in the areas of cybersecurity, healthcare, and agrifood. One of the most unique features of Israel’s AI ecosystem is its ability to attract early-stage funding, the report said. The report found that Israeli AI startups outperform their non-AI counterparts by at least 10% in securing initial capital. Furthermore, just 32% of AI startups remain unfunded within their first two years, compared to 50% of non-AI startups. As a result, Israel’s number of active AI companies has jumped from 779 in 2014 to 2,170 in 2023, according to the study. By the end of 2023, 'for every four American AI companies acquired by these MNCs, one Israeli AI company was also acquired,' the report noted. In healthcare, specifically, the report states that Israeli AI-driven startups are making strides in medical imaging, drug discovery, and clinical trials. In robotics, AI is revolutionizing industries such as agriculture, with Israeli AI robotics companies attracting 78% of total investment in the sector. Similarly, in climate tech, AI is being used to address climate challenges like weather modeling, sustainable agriculture, and wildfire prevention, the report said.

Hezbollah terror rockets kill two in Nahariya	Alerts were also activated in the central cities of Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, Petah Tikvah, as well as in the Sharon region. By JNS A rocket fired by Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorists scored a direct hit in the northern Israeli city of Nahariya on Tuesday afternoon, killing two people, the Magen David Adom emergency response group said. Air-raid sirens were also activated in Israel’s densely-populated central region, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed. 'Following the alerts that were activated in several areas in the center of the country, the Air Force intercepted three launches that crossed [into Israel] from Lebanon,' the military subsequently announced on X. Rocket alerts were activated in the central Israeli cities of Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, Petach Tikvah, as well as in major population centers in the Sharon region, including Herzliya, Ra’anana and Kfar Saba, sending millions running for shelter, according to the IDF Home Front Command.

Canadian city to permit ceremony honoring architect of October 7t...	City in Ontario refuses to shut down planned vigil in public square honoring Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief and architect of the October 7th massacres. By World Israel News Staff Pro-Hamas activists in Canada are planning to hold a public vigil honoring the architect of the October 7th massacres of Israelis, after municipal officials announced they would not interfere with the planned event. The event is set to be held on Tuesday, November 26th, at Mississauga City Hall’s Celebration Square in Mississauga, a city of 718,000 in the greater Toronto area. Flyers advertising the event were spotted last week, using the poppy flower symbol, established by the Royal Canadian Legion as a way to pay tribute to Canadian veterans, next to a photograph of the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar with the words 'Lest We Forget Our Heroes: Vigil For Resistance Leaders.' One advertisement said the event would commemorate '40 days after the Martyrdom of the leaders of Resistance fighting for Palestinian freedom.' No organization has been linked to the planned event, with only an email address, allheavens313@gmail.com, provided in the ads. Advertisement for a vigil honoring Yahya Sinwar in the Canadian city of Mississauga. (X) An anti-Israel activist, Faris Al Najim, released a video on November 11th, Remembrance Day, announcing the event in honor of Sinwar. The City of Mississauga has come under fire after city officials announced they would not be interfering with the planned event. 'The City of Mississauga has become aware of a vigil planned for November 26, 2024 to take place on Celebration Square,' city officials said in a statement. 'The City has not issued a permit for this group to host a vigil. It is not the City’s practice to issue permits for vigils as Celebration Square is a public space, usable by the community. Under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, groups have the right of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The City will not interfere with a peaceful vigil, as long as all laws and City by-laws are adhered to.' Social media users were quick to point out that the event constitutes promotion of Hamas, which Canada has banned as a terror organization. 'Everybody knows if the KKK were to hold a rally honouring the death of their leader, it would not be permitted to happen any more than if a bunch of Nazis decided to mark Hitler’s birthday,' columnist Joe Warmington wrote in the Toronto Sun. 'Hamas is not any different and is a banned terror group in Canada. Celebrating them is obscene — and hurtful to the families of their victims.' The Royal Canadian Legion has penned a cease-and-desist letter to the event’s organizers over their unauthorized use of the Legion’s poppy flower symbol. Mississauga Mayor Carolyn Parrish defended the city’s refusal to bar the event, saying any such steps would constitute 'preferential treatment.' 'That would be called censorship, preferential treatment, being judgmental — the stifling of freedom of speech which is something most Canadians value,' the mayor tweeted. On Monday night, Parrish appeared to deny that the event was actually going to be held, suggesting the ads were part of a hoax. 'Consulted a network of Muslim organizations, serious partners in many activities of our city - coaching sports, walkathons for Trillium Hospital and diabetes.

Four soldiers killed by anti-tank missile in northern Gaza	The dead are First Sergeants Nave Yair Asulin, Ofir Eliyahu, Orr Katz, and Gary Lalhruaikima Zolat of the Kfir Brigade. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Four IDF soldiers of the Kfir Brigade’s Shimshon Brigade were killed in battle in the northern Gaza Strip, the IDF announced Tuesday. First Sergeants Nave Yair Asulin (21) of Carmit, Ofir Eliyahu (20) of Holon, Orr Katz (20) of Maaleh Adumim, and Gary Lalhruaikima Zolat (21) of Afula, died in an explosion in Jabalya while fighting Hamas terrorists. The initial army investigation of the incident is pointing to their being hit by an anti-tank missile fired by a Hamas terrorist into the building they had just entered. Asulin went to live in the Negev community of Carmit six years ago together with his parents and two brothers. According to his cousin Tair Yifrach’s testimonial to Ynet, he had always wanted to become a combat soldier, 'out of great love of the country.' Asulin 'only wanted to add good to the world,' she said, adding that after his IDF service, he 'dreamed of becoming an architect.' Eliyahu’s mother, Nadia, told the news site that her son had been injured, tearing his knee, during basic training in 2022 and had been determined to return to his combat unit. His father, Ami, said that 'Ofir and his friends only wanted to fight for the country&#8230;. It’s been a hard year. With every knock on the door we ran [to it] like madmen, and this time it happened, the awful knock came to us.' Eliyahu was an avid fan of the Hapoel Holon basketball team, and was planning to go on a post-service trip to the United States with his army buddies. Katz had twice already received a certificate of excellence from the IDF during his service. He served in the north, then Hebron, and only ten days ago entered Gaza for the first time, his sister-in-law, Noy, told Ynet. His first name, Orr, means 'light' in Hebrew, and she said that Katz 'was exactly like his name, wherever he was, people would feel the light.' He 'always helped anyone who asked,' she said, and the family was finding it impossible to internalize his loss. Zolat was a member of Bnei Menashe community, a group of crypto-Jews in India which claims descent from the ancient tribe of Manasseh. Most of the community converted to Judaism in coordination with Israel's Chief Rabbinate, but it is only being allowed to immigrate to Israel piecemeal. He came to Afula from Sderot with his family in 2014. His father, Dagan, described him as a person who 'loved his family and army friends, and to take care of animals. He wanted to be a combat soldier.' The local HaEmek Mynet site reported that he 'loved his army service and protecting the State and the Jewish people.' Zolat is survived by his parents and three siblings. A fifth soldier, Maj. (res.) Itamar Levin Fridman, 34, a member of the elite anti-terror the LOTAR Eilat unit, was killed Monday in a separate battle in Jabalya, also by an anti-tank missile. The IDF entered the Gazan town in October for the fourth time since the beginning of the war last year to clear it out once again of Hamas forces. It was labelled the 'most significant center of gravity' for the terrorist organization in the northern part of the Strip and the army is determined to break it once and for all. To do so, the army set up humanitarian corridors to enable the civilian residents to leave, which some 60,000 did despite the attempts of Hamas to force them to stay so they could be used as human shields. The death toll from the ground invasion of Gaza now stands at 375 IDF soldiers.

‘Miracle’ – Hezbollah drone hits kindergarten, no children hurt	The drone hit exactly where we had been,' says kindergarten teacher. By World Israel News Staff An explosive drone launched by the Hezbollah terror group struck a Haifa-area kindergarten on Tuesday morning, causing damage to the property but no injuries to children or staff. Footage from the scene circulating on social media showed damage to the facility’s outdoor play area, the building itself, and that the kindergarten’s windows had been shattered by the blast. 'We had a miracle of miracles,' Sarah Yasour, a teacher at the preschool, told Hebrew-language news outlets. Yasour said that she had been in the outdoor play area with the children shortly before the explosive drone impacted. She noted that no alarms had sounded in Nesher, a community on the outskirts of Haifa where the kindergarten is located. But, Yasour noted, she and other staffers heard sirens coming from nearby areas and decided to move the children into the facility’s bomb shelter as a precaution. 'We heard a very distant siren… and said ‘alright let’s go inside,’' Yasour recounted. Just a few seconds after all the children were in the shelter, 'we suddenly heard a huge noise and understood it must be close,' she said. 'Only when we got out did we realize the scale of the miracle. [The drone] hit exactly where we had been.' While Israel's Iron Dome intercepts the vast majority of projectiles fired from Lebanon, explosive drones have proved to be a challenge for air defense system. Because drones fly at a low altitude - literally under the radar - they aren't always detected by Israel's air defenses. In October, an explosive drone launched by Hezbollah struck Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. Netanyahu's son recently postponed his upcoming wedding, due to concerns that the event will be targeted by explosive drones. An explosive drone launched from Lebanon that went undetected struck a Golani Brigade training base near Binyamina, killing four soldiers.

‘No ceasefire in Lebanon until victory,’ Israel’s new defense chi...	Israel's new defense minister vows to continue war against Hezbollah 'without ceasefire and without pause' until terror group forced back north of Litani River and northern Israeli towns secured. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's new defense chief vowed Tuesday to continue the ground operation against the Iranian backed terrorist group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon until the IDF achieves victory and secures all of Israel's goals in the current conflict. Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud), who was tapped by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week to replace Yoav Gallant (Likud), held his first meeting with the IDF General Staff on Monday, discussing the ongoing conflict with Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah. 'In my first meeting today with the IDF General Staff Forum,' Katz tweeted Monday, 'I emphasized: Iran is more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities. We have the opportunity to achieve our most important goal – to thwart and eliminate the existential threat to the State of Israel.' In a follow-up post Tuesday morning, Katz revealed that during Monday's meeting with IDF top brass he had emphasized that Israel will continue its military pressure on Hezbollah until the terror group's infrastructure in southern Lebanon is dismantled, the terror group is pushed away from the Israeli border, and northern Israeli towns are secured. 'The warning and powerful activity carried out by the IDF and the security agencies against Hezbollah and the elimination of Nasrallah are a picture of victory and the offensive activity should be continued, in order to increase and worsen Hezbollah's capabilities and realize the fruits of victory,' Katz said. In stark contrast to a recent report which claimed that the IDF's Northern Command had stated that the military had achieved its goals in Lebanon and that the time is ripe for a diplomatic solution, Katz vowed 'no ceasefire' and 'no respite' in the war until Israel has achieved all of its war aims. 'In Lebanon there will be no ceasefire and there will be no respite. We will continue to hit Hezbollah with full force until the goals of the war are achieved.' 'Israel will not agree to any arrangement that does not guarantee Israel's right to enforce and prevent terrorism on its own, and meeting the goals of the war in Lebanon, disarming Hezbollah and withdrawing them beyond the Litani River and returning the residents of the north safely to their homes.'

Trump may not back Israeli annexation plan, warn aides	Former Trump administration officials warn Israel that the president-elect may not back plans to apply sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, adding President Trump had only backed such a move in 2020 as part of his larger peace plan. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President and President-elect Donald Trump may not back plans by the Netanyahu government to extend Israeli sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria, multiple former Trump administration officials warned Israeli government ministers. According to a report Tuesday morning by The Times of Israel which cited three separate sources, at least two former Trump aides told Israeli ministers recently not to assume that Trump will support their plans to apply Israeli sovereignty over part or all of Judea and Samaria after he takes office on January 20th. The message was reportedly conveyed in multiple conversations over the last few months, with the latest having taken place last week. On the other hand, the former Trump officials did not say the incoming president would oppose such steps, but merely advised Israeli leaders not to view his support as a 'foregone conclusion.' One former Trump aide emphasized that the president-elect would not support an Israeli plan to extend sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria 'in a vacuum,' noting that Trump’s willingness in 2020 to back Israeli annexation plans was closely tied to Jerusalem’s acceptance of his Deal of the Century peace plan. 'If it happens, it will have to be part of a process,' the official was quoted as saying. In 2020, ahead of the presidential election, Israel and the United States vowed to the United Arab Emirates as part of the Abraham Accords that Jerusalem would not move forward with applying sovereignty in Judea and Samaria for an extended period of time. While the duration of that prohibition was never publicized, last year, the United Arab Emirates Ambassador to the United States, Yousef al-Otaiba, claimed at a Washington conference that Israel is bound only until the end of 2024 – a claim confirmed by multiple sources who spoke with The Times of Israel. On Tuesday, Kan Reshet Bet reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has privately reassured senior government ministers that he plans on putting his 2019 annexation plans back on the agenda. Ministers, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) have both publicly called on the government to move forward with the sovereignty plans once Trump enters office.

Israeli lawmaker who backed anti-Israel genocide charges banned f...	The extreme leftist MK had joined S. Africa in charging Israel at the International Court of Justice with attempted genocide in Gaza. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Extreme leftist Ofer Cassif was banned from Knesset for six months Monday by the body’s Ethics Committee for his unrelenting, public vilification of Israel and the IDF since the Israel-Hamas war began thirteen months ago. The committee, consisting of two legislators each from the coalition and Opposition, unanimously decided that the MK’s actions and words went beyond what could be tolerated as free speech, especially during wartime. The only Jew on the Arab Hadash-Ta’al list was 'encouraging bloodshed against IDF soldiers and the State of Israel, while undermining the state’s ability to deal' with charges against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), it said in its decision. Cassif had joined South Africa’s petition at the ICJ to try Israel for attempting to commit 'genocide' in the Gaza Strip even as the noncombatant-to-combatant deaths are about two to one, a ratio whose excellence is almost unheard-of during war. He also repeatedly vilified the IDF for supposedly committing war crimes and referenced the Holocaust in accusing the government of using the October 7 surprise invasion in which Hamas and other terrorists massacred 1,200 people, including women, children and the elderly, as a reason to carry out a 'final solution' against the Palestinians. The committee also referenced pre-war statements Cassif had made justifying Palestinian terrorism against civilians and calling jailed terrorists 'political prisoners.' Cassif was not only unrepentant in his response to the temporary expulsion, he doubled down on his anti-Israel stance. Posting to X that the country was only a 'so-called democracy' that was fast becoming fascist, he called the move 'political censorship' by a 'bloody, evil government' that 'celebrate[s] the killing of innocents' while 'those who fight for justice and peace are persecuted as traitors.' Cassif’s ban extends to participating in or even entering plenary sessions and Knesset committee meetings, although he will be allowed to vote on bills. His pay was docked for two weeks as well. While it was the harshest punishment given to a Knesset member in years, it did not come close to the desire of a vast majority of the legislature to kick him out permanently. In February, 85 MKs voted to oust him, but 90 are necessary for such a move and it failed. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir referenced this when he said, 'The terror supporter Ofer Cassif should be permanently expelled from the Israeli Knesset and deported to Syria. Six months is not enough.' Human rights organization Betsalmo, which had demanded two weeks ago that the Committee meet after Cassif had branded an IDF soldier who fell in Gaza as a 'criminal' and 'monster,' expressed limited satisfaction with the verdict. 'I congratulate the decision to suspend [Cassif] from the Knesset and the monetary fine,' said director Shai Glick, but then added, 'Cassif should be in jail and not the Knesset.' 'Cassif has been a terror supporter for a long time and chooses in Israel’s most dire hour to support the enemy anytime and anywhere, as well as vilify IDF soldiers, even those who fell in battle,' Glick said. 'He [also] has been indicted for the most serious crime of attacking a police officer&#8230; [but] he received a ‘celebrity discount’ and is walking around freely while his trial has been postponed for a long time.' The MK was indicted in January on charges of aggravated assault against a police officer as a result of a fracas in Judea and Samaria in May 2022. This is punishable by a sentence of at least three months but can also be increased to as much as five years in prison.

Report: Netanyahu to resume annexation bid after Trump takes offi...	Israeli prime minister reportedly backing calls from senior government ministers pushing to apply sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria once Donald Trump returns to office. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning on moving forward with plans to apply Israeli sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria, according to a report Tuesday. Kan Reshet Bet reported Tuesday morning that Netanyahu has privately reassured senior government ministers that his sovereignty plans, shelved since President Joe Biden's win in 2020, would be placed back on the agenda after Trump returns to office. During the first Trump administration, Netanyahu proposed to extend Israeli sovereignty over large swaths of Judea and Samaria, beginning with the Jordan Valley and including all Israeli towns in the area. 'I intend to extend sovereignty on all the settlements and settlement blocs,' Netanyahu said on the eve of the September 17th, 2019 elections. The plans were incorporated into President Donald Trump's 'Peace to Prosperity' plan, better known as the 'Deal of the Century,' under which Israel would apply sovereignty to large sections of Area C in Judea and Samaria, spanning all areas of Israeli settlement. In exchange, Israel would agree to the broader peace deal, which would endorse the establishment of a Palestinian state in parts of Judea, Samaria, all of the Gaza Strip, and several enclaves in the Israeli Negev. Following the Hamas invasion of October 7th, some members of Netanyahu's coalition government have called for the annexation of the Gaza Strip, as well as Judea and Samaria. Calls for applying Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria were voiced again following Donald Trump's electoral win on November 5th. 'Now this is the time for sovereignty, this is the time for total victory,' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) said in an address to the Knesset plenum last Wednesday. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) declared in a press conference Monday that 2025 will 'be the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.' 'I gave instructions to the settlement administration in the Ministry of Defense and to the Civil Administration to begin comprehensive professional staff work to prepare the necessary infrastructure for the application of sovereignty.' 'Subsequently, I intend to lead a government decision stating that the Government of Israel will act with the new administration of President Trump and the international community to apply sovereignty and seek American recognition.' Israel Ganz, chairman of the Yesha Council – which represents all Israeli towns across Judea and Samaria – and mayor of the Binyamin Regional Council, took to X/Twitter to call for annexing Judea and Samaria following Trump’s victory. 'Time for sovereignty! One strong Trump. One Jewish state.'

House set to vote on bill targeting nonprofits accused of support...	Critics of the bill say it grants too much power to the government and that it could be used to silence political dissent. By Asaf Elia-Shalev, JTA U.S. law prohibits nonprofits from providing support to terrorist organizations, but enforcing that prohibition requires the government to furnish proof of a violation, triggering a judicial process that can be lengthy and arduous. In the more than two decades since the current law was enacted, following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the law has rarely led to penalties: nine charities have lost their tax-exempt status under its terms. A bipartisan bill slated for a major vote on Capitol Hill Tuesday aims to create a new way to achieve that goal without the existing legal hurdles. The bill would give the treasury secretary new powers to independently classify any nonprofit as a terrorist-supporting organization and revoke its tax-exempt status almost immediately. A version of the bill was introduced following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas invasion of Israel and passed the House in April, amid a wave of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, which many pro-Israel groups labeled as 'pro-Hamas.' The bill advanced with broad bipartisan support, 382-11, but stalled in the Senate. Now, the new version of the bill is dividing Jewish groups. Centrist and conservative groups support the bill as an urgent measure to curb support for terrorism. Progressive organizations oppose it as a threat to political dissent — and worry that the powers it affords will be abused by the incoming Trump administration to go after groups that oppose its policies. At a September hearing, Robert Harvey, an expert at Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, explained that the government would not be required to disclose how it reached its determination or to provide any evidence of wrongdoing. 'As I understand it, all the Treasurer has to do to deny tax exemption is to mail a notice to the organization involved saying: ‘You’re a terrorist supporting organization, we have found you are providing material support, and you’re denied your exemption?’' Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett asked Harvey, according to The Intercept. 'That’s correct, Mr. Doggett,' Harvey replied. Lawmakers sponsoring the bill say the government needs a better tool to prevent terrorist organizations from being subsidized by American taxpayers. Their position is endorsed by the Anti-Defamation League, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and the Republican Jewish Coalition. The bill would allow the Treasury Department to act against the U.S.-registered charities that it determines have provided support to groups designated as terrorist organizations by the United States — including, for example, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, both based in Gaza, and the Lebanese Hezbollah. After making the determination, the Treasury would notify the charity, giving it 90 days to file a court challenge before losing its tax-exempt status. Republican Rep. David Kustoff of Tennessee, one of the bill’s two Jewish cosponsors along with Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois, says the problem isn’t theoretical: He claims tax-exempt donations are currently flowing to terrorist organizations, though neither he nor any other proponents of the bill have named specific examples. 'To put it plainly, domestic financiers of terrorism are currently being subsidized by U.S. taxpayer dollars,' Kustoff said earlier this year. 'Let me be clear: No American should receive a tax benefit for funding terrorism.' The RJC said the bill should be used to ensure that Hamas and other terrorist organizations are not receiving any funds from U.S. nonprofits, and framed it as a tool against groups that attack American Jews and Israel. 'Congress is right to address the threat of organizations using tax-exempt funds to support Hamas and other terrorist groups,' RJC said in a statement. 'In case last week’s election results didn’t make it clear: The days of impunity for antisemitic extremists who target the Jewish state and Jewish Americans are over.' Critics of the bill say it grants too much power to the government and that it could be used to silence political dissent — particularly from pro-Palestinian organizations that don’t have ties to terror groups but may nonetheless be branded as supporters of Hamas. The language of the bill prohibits providing 'material support or resources,' a category defined in law that, opponents say, could still be interpreted broadly. They also worry that the incoming Trump administration could use the bill to penalize groups focusing on signature progressive issues such as reproductive justice, the environment, and promoting immigration. The American Civil Liberties Union has been spearheading opposition to the bill with support from voices on both sides of the political spectrum. The libertarian Cato Institute and Reason magazine, for example, have come out against the bill. So have several progressive American Jewish groups such as Bend the Arc and the New Israel Fund. 'This bill is as dangerous as it is extraneous,' the New Israel Fund, which donates to civil society groups in Israel, many of them left-leaning, said in a statement. 'The United States already has a meticulous process in place to determine whether a group is providing material support for terrorism. What this would do is strip that system of due process and enable willy-nilly terrorist designations.' The bill is scheduled for a full vote in the House of Representatives Tuesday, after which it would have to be approved by the Senate and signed by the president. The current version of the bill is identical to the one that passed in April, except that it’s been combined with another bill that aims to give American hostages and political prisoners held abroad relief from tax deadlines and penalties. The ACLU believes the pairing with an unobjectionable bill is a ploy to weaken the likelihood of opposition.

Ex-IDF soldier becomes first Republican in 50 years to win New Yo...	Though Norber focused his campaign on domestic issues such as bolstering law enforcement and cutting taxes, he believes that his support for Israel also helped him establish valuable inroads with the local Jewish community. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner A former officer in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) became the first Republican to win a state assembly seat in northern Hempstead, Long Island in more than 50 years. Daniel Norber narrowly defeated two-term Democratic incumbent Gina Silitti to capture the 16th District of the New York State Assembly. The district encompasses most of Nassau County, an area which maintains a significant Jewish population. Norber’s victory came amid a huge surge in support for Republican candidates across the country. US President-elect Donald Trump won the 16th District by over 2,000 votes, assisting Norber, a dual US-Israeli citizen, secure victory in his history-making down-ballot race. The ex-IDF officer’s win also came in the midst of increasing antisemitism across the country. In the year following the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel last Oct. 7, Jewish families in Nassau County have reported being targeted with hate crimes. In September, a Jewish family in Nassau County alleged that a suspect urinated on their front door and yelled antisemitic slurs. Months earlier in April, county officials denounced antisemitic graffiti which covered the faces of hostages taken captive by Hamas during the Oct. 7 onslaught. Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, who is Jewish, has also accused Civil Service Employees Association Local 830, an 8,000-member local union, of antisemitism for distributing flyers depicting him with devil horns. Silitti, Norber’s opponent, found herself in hot water with the local Jewish community after one of her staffers bashed Israel on social media. 'She wasn’t sensitive to what was going on. I felt she was out of touch,' Norber, 45, told the New York Post. Moreover, his grandparents endured the Holocaust and his mother ran away from communism in the Soviet Union. Norber was also on the ground in Israel during the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks with his wife and four kids. 'It was the worst atrocity to Jews since the Holocaust. Israel is not the same anymore,' Norber said, according to the Post. Norber has also touted a series of policies which would likely bolster Jewish safety in Nassau County. In the New York State Assembly, he aims to implement a statewide mask ban with the goal of preventing anonymity during protests — a popular tactic employed by activists during anti-Israel demonstrations to hid their identity. The lawmaker also wants to repeal cashless bail, with the intention of reducing the number of violent criminals on the streets.

Climate activist Greta Thunberg accuses Turkey of quietly support...	Radical Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg appears to call for Israel's destruction with 'Free Palestine - From the River to the Sea' slogan. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg accused the Turkish government of quietly backing Israel, despite Ankara's imposition of a trade ban on Israel adopted in May, and the bombastic anti-Israel rhetoric of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Sunday, the 21-year-old activist issued a video statement calling on her supporters to join demonstrations around the world outside Turkish embassies, protesting the use of the Baku, Tbilisi, Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline to transfer Azerbaijani oil to Israel, via the Turkish port city of Ceyhan. 'This is an urgent call to action. On November 11th, we must stand together at Turkish embassies worldwide to demand an end to Turkey's and Azerbaijan's complicity in the violence against Gaza,' Thunberg said. 'President Erdogan talks of solidarity with Palestine, but Turkey's ports remain open, allowing oil to flow to Israel, fuel for the very machinery slaughtering Palestinians.' 'The The BTC pipeline, run by BP and Azerbaijan state-owned oil company SOCAR, supplies nearly half of Israel's oil. Erdogan and [Azerbaijan's president, Ilham] Aliyev profit by securing their foothold in the global energy market, while Palestinians pay with their lives.' 'On November 11th, we'll gather at Turkish embassies around the world to demand justice for Palestine and for Turkey and Azerbaijan to end their complicity.' Thunberg reiterated her accusation of genocide in the Gaza Strip, and appeared to call for the destruction of the State of Israel. 'Stop fueling genocide!' Thunberg said. 'Free Palestine, From the River to the Sea.' Turkey's Energy Ministry denied that Azerbaijani oil is currently being shipped to Israel via Ceyhan, claiming that such shipments were terminated following the May 2024 trade ban on Israel. In a statement Monday, the ministry said it was bound by a 1999 agreement establishing the BTC pipeline not to interfere with the transfer of energy, while at the same time denouncing 'accusations' that oil continues to be shipped to Israel via Ceyhan as ' completely baseless.' 'Companies transporting oil through the BTC pipeline for export to global markets from the Haydar Aliyev Terminal, have respected Turkey's recent decision not to engage in trade with Israel,' the ministry said. 'No deliveries to Israel as the delivery destination have taken place.'

Amsterdam pogrom, protests coordinated with ‘extremist’ network l...	The coordination behind these events reflects a well-honed strategy by radical groups to use public gatherings to incite and escalate violence. By Debbie Weiss, The Algemeiner The violence against Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam last week was a premeditated and coordinated attack orchestrated with extremist networks linked to a former employee of the controversial United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), a group tracking online disinformation told The Algemeiner on Monday. The Network Contagion Research Institute’s analysis of open-source intelligence and social media also 'revealed that protests around the Maccabi Tel Aviv game in Amsterdam was not isolated but part of a broader, coordinated effort,' said the group’s co-founder, Joel Finkelstein. Amsterdam resident Ayman Nejmeh, who identified himself on social media as a former UNRWA employee, 'has emerged as a key organizer, coordinating protest actions against Jewish targets,' Finkelstein added. Hundreds of Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer fans, who were visiting the Dutch capital for a game against the local Ajax team, were attacked by Arab and Muslim mobs on Thursday night, landing several in the hospital. It marked the largest mass-scale antisemitic incident in the Netherlands since the Holocaust, with attackers throwing firecrackers and stun grenades, calling for a 'Jew hunt,' and forcing Israelis to say 'Free Palestine' before beating them up. Earlier, Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were recorded chanting anti-Arab slogans and removing a Palestinian flag, prompting some news outlets to frame the ensuing violence as a response. But Israel had issued a warning to Dutch security services ahead of the game that violence was likely to unfold after Islamic groups appeared to be coordinating a multifront attack on social media. According to Finkelstein, the phone number of the Syrian-born Nejmeh was listed as an admin for one WhatsApp group utilized by the Palestinian diaspora group, PGNL. Nejmeh took over the group from Palestinian-Dutch national Amin Abou Rashed, who was arrested last year on suspicion of funneling funds to the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. PGNL had in the past hosted the late Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran earlier this year, in an online event. The group, whose name in Dutch stands for the 'Palestinian Community in the Netherlands,' was also involved in organizing an anti-Israel protest in Dam Square on Sunday, defying a temporary ban imposed after Thursday night’s violence and resulting in dozens of arrests. The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), whose research spans issues from social media bans to online antisemitism, has collaborated with legislative bodies, including the British government and US Congress, on content moderation and combating hate-based misinformation. The group said that its own findings aligned with that of the European Leadership Network, pointing to a transnational network that is actively stoking anti-Jewish sentiments. The coordination behind these events reflects a well-honed strategy by radical groups to use public gatherings to incite and escalate violence, Finkelstein said, warning that organized hate was far outpacing authorities’ ability to respond. 'The ‘pogrom contagion’ spreading across Europe is no accident — terror-linked actors are deliberately weaponizing gatherings and social media to accelerate the spread of violence against Jewish communities,' Finkelstein told The Algemeiner. 'This infrastructure of hate is evolving faster than democratic defenses and, left unchecked, these threats multiply across both borders and ethnicities.' Nejmeh’s Facebook profile, which contained at least one post extolling a Hamas operative for the terrorist group’s Al Qassam military wing, was in recent days purged of any mention of his ties to UNRWA. 'If Nejmeh is scrubbing his social media of these past affiliations, it does raise significant questions about why,' Finkelstein said. Last month, Israel’s parliament passed legislation banning UNRWA from operating in Israel and stopping Israeli authorities from cooperating with the organization, citing the UN agency’s ties to Hamas and what critics described as its 'poisonous influence' in the Middle East. Marcus Sheff, head of IMPACT-se, a research institute monitoring UNRWA, said the findings were further evidence of the refugee agency’s corruption. 'It’s shocking that the organizer of this brutal assault is yet another former UNRWA teacher, funded by American taxpayers for years,' Sheff told The Algemeiner. The Israeli government and research organizations have publicized findings showing numerous UNRWA-employed teachers were directly involved in Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel last Oct. 7, while many others openly celebrated it. The Algemeiner could not independently verify whether Nejmeh, who moved to the Netherlands from Syria in 2018, held a teaching role at UNRWA or served in another capacity. 'Time and again, we have seen UNRWA staff, including school principals, exposed as active terrorists. If there were any lingering doubts after Oct. 7, this serves as another stark proof of a deep-seated rot within UNRWA’s organizational culture,' Sheff added.

By JNS President-elect Donald Trump plans to name Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) as Secretary of State, Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) as national security advisor and Stephen Miller, an adviser to the former president, as deputy chief of staff, according to multiple media outlets. With the reports about Rubio and Waltz, 'Iran’s regime’s supreme leader is in for a difficult morning,' wrote Jason Brodsky, policy director at United Against Nuclear Iran. Rep.

Netanyahu alerted about October 7th attacks just 10 minutes befor...	October 7th, 2023 was also the first time Shin Bet had told the Prime Minister about the activation of Israeli SIM cards in the Gaza Strip and that leaders of the terror group were hiding in underground bunkers. By World Israel News Staff After more than a year of speculation, it has come to light that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was informed by Israel's security agency (Shin Bet) about the October 7th attacks just ten minutes before they happened, Kan News reports. Shin Bet informed the Prime Minister at 6:19 on Saturday morning for the first time that there was unusual activity by Hamas at the border. Saturday morning, October 7th, 2023, was also the first time Shin Bet had told the Prime Minister about the activation of Israeli SIM cards in the Gaza Strip and that leaders of the terror group were hiding in underground bunkers, apparently preparing for an attack. After a six-minute conversation, Netanyahu and Shin Bet agreed to have a situational assessment at 8:00. The military secretary, General Avi Gil, then called the head of the chief of staff's office. During their conversation, at 6:29, the missile barrage began. Although Netanyahu was not informed of the situation at the Gaza border until shortly before the attack occurred, there is some indication that the IDF and Shin Bet were aware of irregular activity at the border among Hamas terrorists sometime prior to October 7th. According to Yedioth Aharonoth, the sudden mass activation of Israeli SIM cards by Gaza terrorists has been known for months but was suppressed by Israeli military censors. Hundreds of Israeli SIM cards, used to provide cellular service via Israeli providers, were activated at around midnight between October 6th and 7th, multiple Israeli news outlets reported, just hours before the invasion of Israel that caught the IDF off guard and left some 1,200 Israelis dead and 253 in captivity. The reports claim that IDF and Shin Bet intel officials detected approximately 1,000 Israeli SIM cards being activated at around midnight on October 7th. They were left puzzled by the mass activation and, because SIM card activations had not been flagged in the past as indications of an impending attack, did not warn IDF Central Command of a possible invasion. While some outlets, including Channel 14, said that roughly 1,000 SIM card activations were detected, the Israeli military and the Shin Bet internal security agency released a joint statement Monday downplaying the claims, calling them 'false and far from reality. ' They said that ' only' several dozen SIM card activations had been detected.

57,000 acres of Israeli forests destroyed from Hezbollah rockets	KKL-JNF estimates the ecosystem will require five to seven years to recover naturally. By Jewish Breaking News The environmental impact of Hezbollah’s sustained attacks on northern Israel has reached catastrophic levels, with over 57,000 acres of land destroyed by fires. According to the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF), the Upper Galilee and Golan Heights have borne the brunt of the destruction, with nearly 43,500 acres scorched. The Lower Galilee lost approximately 6,175 acres, while the Western Galilee and Hula Valley suffered burns of 2,223 and 178 acres, respectively. Particularly hard hit were the Birya and Baal Shem Tov forests near Safed, the Ramot Naftali Forest along the Lebanese border, and the Hazon Forest in the vicinity of Karmiel. Wildlife populations have been severely impacted, with birds losing nesting sites and countless arthropods perishing in the flames. The fires have also ravaged a diverse array of woodland species, from pine, cypress, and cedar to indigenous varieties like oak, Judas trees, and carob. However, the damage extends beyond animal life and vegetation, with significant destruction to infrastructure including parking facilities, observation points, and scenic routes. 'Our foresters alongside the Israel Fire and Rescue Services are forced to work under extremely difficult conditions, under the constant threat of both the fires and the rockets,' stated KKL-JNF director Shelli Ben Yishai. 'Despite the enormous challenges, we continue to work around the clock to protect our forests, the people of the North, and its unique environment.' KKL-JNF estimates the ecosystem will require five to seven years to recover naturally. Since Oct. 7, 2023, the IDF estimates that approximately 10,000 Hezbollah rockets and suicide drones have been launched at the Jewish State. To protect Israel’s ecosystem, the agency operates an advanced monitoring station equipped with aerial drones and sophisticated imaging technology, enabling rangers to spot and respond to fire threats before they spread even further.

Iran turns to chemical weapons in war against Israel	Of particular concern is the potential distribution of these weapons to Iran’s terror proxies. By Jewish Breaking News Iran has developed a powerful chemical weapon based on synthetic opioids that can render entire units of soldiers helpless within minutes. The US and its allies have warned for years that Iran is developing pharmaceutical-based weapons in breach of the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. A recent U.S. State Department report revealed that Iran’s Chemistry Department at Imam Hossein University attempted to acquire large quantities of medetomidine, a veterinary sedative, from Chinese suppliers in 2014. The quantity sought – enough for over 10,000 doses – far exceeded any legitimate research needs. Further confirmation came in September 2023 when Iranian anti-government hackers leaked documents exposing details of an Iranian military university’s development of medetomidine-based grenades, according to the State Department. Security experts warn that these pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs) represent a new category of threat, distinct from traditional chemical weapons. When deployed, PBAs target the central nervous system, rapidly rendering victims unconscious. Of particular concern is the potential distribution of these weapons to Iran’s terror proxies. Although Israel’s military campaigns in Lebanon have dealt serious blows to Hezbollah and its massive missile stockpile, PBAs remain a viable threat as they can be easily incorporated into hand grenades and mortar shells – weapons Hezbollah still possesses in large quantities. 'Maybe you just use them to incapacitate the border guards and reach the now unprotected civilians,' Matthew Levitt, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, tells Business Insider. 'Or, you actually target and incapacitate the soldiers so you can kidnap or capture them.' 'At a time of growing regional instability in the Middle East, largely the result of the militancy of Iranian proxies, the threats posed by Iran’s weaponized PBA program can no longer be overlooked,' says Levitt. Levying sanctions on Iran’s import of PBAs is also extremely difficult because they overlap with products used for legitimate medical purposes. The Islamic Republic should know better than anyone the horrific toll of chemical weapons, having suffered over a million casualties from Iraqi nerve gas and mustard gas attacks during the Iran-Iraq war. Yet Tehran has shown no hesitation in deploying these weapons themselves – first using mustard gas against Iraqi forces in 1987, then employing PBAs against Syrian rebels during their civil war, and most recently through their Iraqi militias who reportedly used chemical agents to suppress civilian protesters in 2019.

US set to judge Israel progress on Gaza aid this week	This week we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made,' Jake Sullivan told the CBS program 'Face the Nation.' By Reuters and The Algemeiner The United States this week will decide whether Israel has made progress toward improving the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and how Washington will respond, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday as Israel began to make its case. President Joe Biden’s administration told Israel in an Oct. 13 letter signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that the longtime US ally must take steps within 30 days on a series of measures or risk restrictions on American military aid. 'This week we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made,' Sullivan told the CBS program 'Face the Nation.' 'And then Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, the president will make judgments about what we do in response, and I’m not going to get ahead of that.' COGAT, the Israeli military agency that deals with Palestinian civilian affairs, on Sunday published a list of Israel‘s humanitarian efforts over the past six months, 'highlighting recent initiatives and detailing plans to sustain support for Gaza as winter approaches.' 'Through expanded routes, medical assistance, infrastructure improvements and coordination with international partners, COGAT continues to facilitate the implementation of humanitarian efforts that are meant to help the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,' the agency said. The US deadline is set to expire just days after global food security experts said there is a 'strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas' of northern Gaza as Israel pursues a military offensive against Hamas Palestinian terrorists there. Israel began its wide military push in northern Gaza last month. The United States has said it is watching to ensure that Israel‘s actions on the ground show that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government does not have a 'policy of starvation' in the north. COGAT on Saturday pushed back against the rare alert by the independent Famine Review Committee, which reviews findings by the internationally recognized standard known as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. The Israeli agency said that 'all projections by the IPC have proven incorrect and inconsistent with the situation on the ground' and that Israel‘s military 'operates and will continue to operate in accordance with international law to facilitate and ease the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza.' COGAT also said Friday that it is preparing to open another crossing — at Kissufim — into Gaza. The UN has accused Israel of hindering and blocking attempts to deliver aid, particularly to Gaza‘s north. Israel‘s UN Ambassador Danny Danon last month told the Security Council that the issue in Gaza was not a lack of aid, saying more than a million tons had been delivered during the past year. He accused Hamas of hijacking the assistance.

Syria: Israeli airstrike kills 9 near Homs	The strike targeted a Hezbollah ammunition storage facility on the Homs-Damascus road. By JNS The Israeli Air Force struck targets near the village of Shinshar, located on the outskirts of Homs, Syria on Monday, Syria’s state-run SANA news agency reported. Nine people killed and more than 10 wounded in the strikes, according to the report. According to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is associated with the Syrian opposition, the strike targeted a Hezbollah ammunition storage facility on the Homs-Damascus road. UPDATE Very serious strike in Homs, Syria initial reports of many casualties pic.twitter.com/Na9Huw8Mld &mdash; Open Source Intel (@Osint613) November 11, 2024 The alleged Israeli strike comes after Arab media reported on Sunday that Israel had killed a Hezbollah commander in Syria convicted in 2020 for the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri in 2005. Salim Jamil Ayyashm, a senior member of the Iranian terror proxy’s assassinations unit (Unit 121), was reportedly eliminated near the Syrian city of al-Qusayr in the Homs region. In 2020, he was sentenced in absentia to five life sentences by the U.N.-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon for his role in the assassination of Hariri, who was killed along with 21 others by a car bomb in Beirut on Feb. 14, 2005. The U.S. State Department had offered a $10 million reward for information on his whereabouts. Also on Sunday, Al-Arabiya reported that the head of Hezbollah’s 'Golan file' had been killed in an Israeli strike in Damascus. Ali Daqduq, known as Abu Hussein, held various operational roles with Hezbollah since 1983. In 2006, he was sent to Iraq to aid Shi’ite militias in fighting the United States. He was captured by American forces in Basra and handed over to Iraqi authorities, who released him, after which he returned to Lebanon. The United States believes he was involved in an attack on the Karbala Provincial Coordination Center in which five American soldiers were killed.

Hezbollah taunts IDF, denies it received ceasefire proposal	As long as you cannot control areas in the field, you won't achieve your political goals,' says Hezbollah spokesman, denying the war has taken a toll on the group's missile arsenal. By World Israel News Staff Senior spokesman for the Hezbollah terror organization mocked Israel on Monday, denying that the IDF had taken control of towns in southern Lebanon and rejecting claims that the ongoing war with Israel has taken a toll on Hezbollah's rocket and missile arsenal. Downplaying reports of major progress towards a truce with Israel, Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Afif said Monday that the group has not received any official ceasefire proposal. Afif added that Hezbollah has sufficient weapons and supplies to sustain a prolonged conflict with Israel. The Hezbollah representative also claimed that six weeks into Israel’s ground operations in southern Lebanon, Israeli forces have yet to secure 'even a single village,' an apparent reference to reports of an abortive operation in the the town of Khiam last week. 'As long as you are not able to control areas in the field, you will not achieve your political goals,' Afif said. Despite Afif's claims, Israeli forces have reportedly captured multiple villages close to the border during the ongoing ground offensive. Afif disputed Israeli claims that Hezbollah’s missile arsenal had been substantially depleted, noting that the group continues to launch numerous projectiles daily, targeting areas deep within Israel. On Monday, the terror group launched roughly fifty rockets at the northern Israeli city of Karmiel. While the IDF said that most of the projectiles were either intercepted by Israel's missile defense network or landed in open spaces, at least one rocket struck the Arab Israeli town of Bi’ina, injuring a 27-year-old woman, a 35-year-old man, and an 8-month-old baby. On Sunday, Israeli media outlets reported that Russia has joined efforts by the U.S. to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. A day later, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar confirmed that progress has been made towards a truce, but added that no agreement has yet been reached on an enforcement mechanism to to keep Hezbollah from rebuilding its forces along the Israeli border.

Three people, including a baby, were injured after Hezbollah rockets pounded northern Israeli city, as IDF warns villagers in southern Lebanon to evacuate. By World Israel News Staff At least three people were injured Monday afternoon, after Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon launched roughly 50 rockets at northern Israel. The projectiles were directed towards the city of Karmiel and its environs, with multiple rockets landing inside Karmiel. One rocket struck the Arab Israeli town of Bi'ina, located near Karmiel, injuring a 27-year-old woman, a 35-year-old man, and an 8-month-old baby. Emergency first responders were dispatched to the scene of the attack to treat the injured and evacuate them to a local hospital for further treatment. According to preliminary reports, the female victim is listed in moderate condition, while the 35-year-old man and the baby are both in light condition. In addition to the three victims who were injured in the rocket attacks, a number of other people were treated for shock. Most of the rockets were either intercepted or landed in open spaces causing no damage, the IDF said. The Israeli military called on the residents of villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate, ahead of an apparent airstrike against Hezbollah. The IDF's Arabic spokesman, Avichay Adaree, urged villagers from 21 towns south of the Awali River to leave there homes and move northward. 'Hezbollah's terrorist activities force the IDF to act forcefully against it in these areas, and we do not intend to harm you,' Adaree said. ' For your safety, you must evacuate your homes immediately and move to the north of the Awali River. For your safety, you must evacuate without delay.'

It’s Official: Trump taps Elise Stefanik as UN ambassador	New York congresswoman who made headlines grilling university administrators over campus antisemitism has accepted President-elect Donald Trump's offer to become US Ambassador to the United Nations. By World Israel News Staff Former President and President-elect Donald Trump confirmed reports Sunday that he has tapped New York Rep. Elise Stefanik to represent the United States at the United Nations. Over the weekend, it was reported that Trump had offered Stefanik the position of Ambassador to the United Nations. On Sunday, the former president issued a statement to The New York Post confirming that he had made the offer to Stefanik, and adding that the congresswoman had accepted. 'I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,' Trump told The New York Post. 'Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.' Stefanik currently serves as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, and has served in the House of Representatives since January 2015, representing New York's 21st congressional district, a Republican-leaning district in upstate New York. A long-time Trump ally, Stefanik first gained national attention last December during congressional hearings on campus antisemitism, during which she grilled a number of senior university administrators over their failure to combat anti-Jewish bigotry following the October 7th invasion. Stefanik issued a statement confirming that she had accepted the nomination, which must still be approved by the Senate following Trump's inauguration on January 20th. 'I am truly honored to earn President Trump’s nomination to serve in his Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,' Stefanik said in a statement issued to the Post. 'During my conversation with President Trump, I shared how deeply humbled I am to accept his nomination and that I look forward to earning the support of my colleagues in the United States Senate.' 'President Trump’s historic landslide election has given hope to the American people and is a reminder that brighter days are ahead — both at home and abroad.' 'America continues to be the beacon of the world, but we expect and must demand that our friends and allies be strong partners in the peace we seek.' The announcement comes a day after Trump ruled out bringing back two former administration officials, including Nikki Haley, who served as ambassador to the UN during the first two years of Trump's presidency.

‘Outrageous demand’ – Court demands Israeli taxpayers cover Octob...	Israeli judiciary orders state to pay nearly one million shekels to Arab law firm representing terrorists from Hamas' elite Nukhba Force which carried out atrocities against Israelis on October 7th. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli judiciary is demanding that Israeli taxpayers pay nearly one million shekels in legal fees for the defense of Hamas terrorists from an elite unit directly responsible for the invasion of October 7th and subsequent massacres of Israelis, according to a report Monday. Arutz Sheva reported that an Arab Israeli law firm which has been providing legal services to Hamas terrorists from the elite Nukhba Force for nearly a year is demanding close to one million shekels ($267,985) from the state treasury, after multiple government ministries refused to foot the bill. Thus far, the Justice Ministry and the National Security Ministry have both refused to reimburse the firm representing the Nukhba Force terrorists, according to the report. An Israeli court is now ordering the Finance Ministry, which administers the state treasury, to cover the terrorists' legal expenses. The issue first arose after the Knesset passed emergency legislation following the October 7th invasion, barring jailed terrorists captured during the current war from being assigned a public defender to represent them. Since then, Israeli courts have ruled that terrorists on trial must still be provided with legal representation, ordering the state to cover their legal fees. By mid-July, at least 80 Nukhba Force terrorists had received court backing for state-funded legal representation. A spokesperson for the Judicial Authority downplayed the court decisions, arguing that the Knesset's legislation barring public defenders from representing terrorists effectively tied the courts' hands. 'The appointment of a lawyer for a Nukhba detainee is not something which is up to the discretion of the court, and representation of a suspect is a prerequisite for holding the hearing via video conference. This is required by the law.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) has ordered the treasury not to transfer funds to cover the legal fees of Nukhba terrorists. 'The citizens of Israel will not fund the legal defense of our despicable enemies,' Smotrich declared. Minister of Construction and Housing Yitzhak Goldknopf (United Torah Judaism) excoriated the judiciary's demand that the treasury pay for terrorists' legal fees. 'This is an absurd and outrageous demand,' Goldknopf tweeted. 'The tax money of the citizens of Israel is not supposed to fund legal representation for the human monsters who massacred men, women and children with terrible cruelty.' 'I call on the Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich not to respond to the request and refer them to their friends in Turkey, Qatar and the Palestinian Terrorist Authority.' The Knesset’s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee has given preliminary approval for legislation which would not only bar terrorists arrested for acts committed on October 7th from being represented by public defenders, but would also prevent the state from funding their defense in any way.

Will Iran strike Israel before Trump inauguration?	On the campaign trial and in his victory speech, Trump repeatedly pledged to 'end wars,' rather than start them. By World Israel News Staff Israeli intelligence and defense agencies anticipate that Iran will attack Israel during the final days of the Biden administration, before president-elect Donald Trump takes office. Due to Trump's support for Israel and his tough stance on Iran, officials in Tehran may view the period before the inauguration on January 20th as its last opportunity to attack Israel. According to a report in Hebrew-language outlet Walla, Iran is planning a response to Israel's October strike on the Islamic Republic, which took out much of the country's air defenses and crippled its missile and drone manufacturing capabilities. Defense and intelligence officials, speaking anonymously to the outlet, said that the Iranian attack may come via its regional proxy groups, presumably to create plausible deniability and discourage a retaliatory strike on Iranian soil. Iran is particularly interested in having its proxies launch an October 7th-style ground invasion of Israel. Originally, Iran planned to have forces - who would not be Iranian army soldiers, but rather members of terror groups such as the Houthis and other Shia-aligned militias - infiltrate Israel via the northern Lebanese and Syrian borders. Due to Israel's invasion of southern Lebanon and heavy troop presence along the Syrian border, Iran has since abandoned that idea and may be gearing up for an invasion via the Jordanian border. It's unclear if Trump would support an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities with American military assets. On the campaign trial and in his victory speech, Trump repeatedly pledged to 'end wars,' rather than start them. However, Trump has held at least three phone calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in recent days. The premier said that the two men 'see eye-to-eye' on pressing issues, presumably including the Iran nuclear threat. Trump has also signaled that he will resume his previous policies of harsh sanctions against Iran, aimed at freezing the country's assets and preventing Tehran from funding terror.

Russia working with US to broker Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire – rep...	One of the major players would be Russia as guarantor that Syria would not continue to be a weapons pipeline. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Details emerged on a possible ceasefire deal between Hezbollah and Israel that would include Russia as one of its major players as well as the U.S. and the Lebanese army, Channel 12 reported Sunday night. Amit Segal reported that once the deal is concluded, the IDF would withdraw most of its forces from southern Lebanon, leaving only a small presence in the villages on the Lebanese side of the border for 60 days, while Hezbollah would withdraw to behind the Litani River. During what Segal called 'the second stage,' the Lebanese army would enter the area, 'and when they finish,' the IDF would return completely to Israel and the permanent ceasefire would officially begin. The implication was that the Lebanese would complete the job of ridding the border area of all Hezbollah weaponry and rockets before the IDF left. This would in essence be the implementation of the major conditions of UN Security Resolution 1701 that ended the Second Lebanon War. What was left unsaid in the report is that Hezbollah is known to have thoroughly infiltrated the national army, and therefore the willingness of the soldiers on the ground to fulfill any such mission may be considered questionable. Israeli troops have found thousands of rifles, machine guns, ammunition, rockets and their launchers, explosive devices and other weapons throughout the villages they have already cleared, as well as underneath them in Hezbollah-dug tunnels. Russia will be an indirect but important player in the deal, Segal said, as it will ostensibly be the guarantor 'that Syria will not continue to be a weapons highway' to Hezbollah. Moscow maintains a mostly discreet military presence and has great influence in Syria, having helped dictator Bashar Assad retain power and take back about half his country from various rebel groups after civil war broke out in his country in 2011. According to various Hebrew media Monday, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer secretly visited Russia last week for four days to discuss details of their involvement in the ceasefire process. It seems that President Vladimir Putin is seriously considering answering positively, as a 'senior Kremlin official' told Kan News that 'Russia is prepared to assist and support anything that would stop the killing of civilians and prevent the destruction of civilian infrastructure.' According to Segal, the 'dividends' that Russia would receive from its cooperation would be two-fold. One is respect, as 'this is an international agreement of insane proportions,' he said. The other is that 'The Biden administration will allow Russian companies that function in Syria to be exempt from sanctions' that most international Russian business are subject to due to the country’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Global sanctions on Russia have hit its economy badly in the almost three years since its play to annex its southern neighbor began. Israel is looking to enshrine its right to oversee the disarmament and ability to enter Lebanon if it sees that Hezbollah is again rearming and taking over the border area. Jerusalem is seeking an American commitment that Washington will back its right to do so. Segal speculated that after Donald Trump assumes office, it will be easier for Israel to take action over the border. Meanwhile, Dermer is landing in the American capital Monday to possibly hammer out these and other details of the incipient agreement.

Houthis fire ballistic missile at Israel, targeting a central arm...	Interceptor fragments caused a fire in Beit Shemesh. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Houthi terror organization in Yemen launched a ballistic missile at Israel’s central region Monday morning that was knocked out before reaching Israel’s coastline, the IDF announced. As per Israeli safety guidelines, warning sirens still sounded at 5:55 AM over large sections of the Plains, Judea, and Lachish regions, sending hundreds of thousands of residents running to safe areas. Fragments of an interceptor missile caused a fire in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Beit Shemesh, which the authorities quickly took care of. Locals spoke of a car and some bushes going up in flames. 'Simultaneously with the extinguishing operations,' the Jerusalem region fire service said in a statement, 'the firefighters are carrying out additional scans in the area, in order to rule out additional fires and damage from interceptor/missile shrapnel.' No one was injured in the incident. The Iran-backed group claimed they were aiming for the Sorek army base, which is located between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and about 20 kilometers from Beit Shemesh. It is one of many of the army’s techno-logistical bases, an Ammunition and Missile Center where parts are stored and supplied to IDF units, soldiers are trained in their use, and work is done there to salvage damaged ammunition. Both civilians and soldiers work at the base. Turkish news agency Anadolu reported that the Houthis claimed their projectile was a 'hypersonic' missile, with spokesman Yahya Saree saying that it had 'precisely hit' its target. Since the Israel-Hamas war began last October after the Gazan terrorists crashed through the border and murdered 1,200 people, the Houthis have shot more than 220 cruise and ballistic missiles and UAVs at the Jewish state to support their fellow Iranian proxy. A very small minority have gotten through Israel’s air defenses, including one in September that was intercepted but not completely destroyed, resulting in missile and interceptor fragments causing some damage to a Modiin train station and a fire in an open area. Israel has also targeted a vital Houthi-held port in Yemen and destroyed several military sites in two long-range airstrikes of its own. The missile launch came a few hours after a Houthi TV outlet reported that the U.S. and Great Britain had conducted several airstrikes in Yemen. Neither country acknowledged an attack, although the two have hit Houthi targets several times this year in retaliation for the terrorists’ repeated missile launches against cargo ships passing their country in international waters. The Houthis’ stated motivation is to support its fellow Iranian client, Hamas, in its war against Israel. Although they say they want to damage the country by stopping shipping to the Jewish state, they have mostly targeted cargoes that have nothing to do with Israel. This has caused many companies to forego the shortest route to the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal, which has meant a tremendous loss of revenue for its owner, Egypt.

Trump rules out bringing back two pro-Israel stalwarts from first...	Ambassador Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, both prominent pro-Israel figures in the first Trump administration, will not be returning to the new administration, Trump announces. By World Israel News Staff Former President and President-elect Donald Trump has ruled out bringing back two pro-Israel stalwarts from his first administration, the incoming president announced over the weekend. In a post to the Truth Social platform on Saturday, Trump wrote that Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations during the first two years of his presidency, would not be tapped to serve in any capacity in the new administration. Haley challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, and initially refused to endorse the former president, before giving his presidential run her backing at the party national convention. Trump also ruled out bringing Mike Pompeo back into his new administration. Pompeo, a former congressman representing Kansas' Fourth Congressional District, served as Director of the CIA under President Trump, before becoming Secretary of State. Between his two roles as CIA director and Secretary of State, Pompeo served throughout the entire four years of the Trump presidency. 'I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' Haley responded via X/Twitter to Trump's post, wishing him 'great success' in his new administration. 'I was proud to work with President Trump defending America at the United Nations. I wish him, and all who serve, great success in moving us forward to a stronger, safer America over the next four years.' On Sunday, Pompeo tweeted that he was 'proud to work with' Trump during his first administration. 'As you said, when we were together last week, you and I built the plan that made the world safer & led to no new wars. America firmly rejected the Biden-Harris foreign policy agenda. We have a duty to put America First again.'
