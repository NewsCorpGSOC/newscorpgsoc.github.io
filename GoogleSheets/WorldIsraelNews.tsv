Bedouin hostage’s father demands Arab world condemn Hamas	We want the Arab world to voice their opinion: What do they think about the fact that innocent people were kidnapped and murdered?' By World Israel News Staff A Bedouin-Israeli father of a recently released hostage, who was held by Hamas for more than a decade, is demanding that the Arab world speak out against the terror group's atrocities. Shabaan a-Sayyid's son Hisham, who has schizophrenia, crossed into the Strip in 2015. He was returned to Israel on Saturday in a near-catatonic state, and appeared to not recognize his own relatives. Speaking to Hebrew-language media, a-Sayyid urged Arab countries to condemn Hamas, whom he said had acted contrary to Islam in their abusive treatment of his son. 'I saw that Bedouins and Arabs were killed, working people who weren’t soldiers or fighters,' said a-Sayyid, referencing the October 7th massacres. 'The Arab world doesn’t react, doesn’t give any response to that, doesn’t take any stance,' he said. 'We want the Arab world, and particularly Arab society in Israel, to voice their opinion: What do they think about the fact that innocent people were kidnapped and murdered?' A-Sayyid said he was shocked by the horrendous treatment his son apparently suffered. 'At the start of [Hisham's] captivity, when there were four hostages in Gaza, I thought that Hamas members would keep him safe,' a-Sayyid said. He said he believed that Hamas understood 'it was in their interest' to ensure his son remained in a good state, so that he could be exchanged for Palestinian terrorists in Israeli prisons. But 'when we got Hisham back, we were relieved to see him walking on his own two feet, but as I held him in my arms, I realized I was hugging a body… not a human being.' The father added that Hisham 'doesn’t talk. He doesn’t have a voice. He can’t remember anything. It’s like he hadn’t been with other human beings.' At least 17 Bedouins were murdered during the October 7th onslaught, and eight were kidnapped. Some were killed by rocket fire, while others were shot to death by rampaging terrorists. One Bedouin man abducted by Hamas, Farhan Al-Qadi, was kept in a subterranean tunnel and given barely enough food to survive, despite being a Muslim.

Freed hostages were isolated in tunnels, starved, and degraded	On Saturday, Hamas released Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham Al-Sayed to Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The six hostages freed on Saturday, like others who have been released, have shared stories of deprivation, humiliation, abuse, starvation, and isolation during their captivity in Gaza. On Saturday, Hamas released Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham Al-Sayed to Israel. Most of the freed hostages describe being held in isolation in tunnels and given very little food. Eliya Cohen was shackled for much of his captivity and was kept alone in darkness. Occasionally, his captors would shine a flashlight in his eyes to create mental confusion. Cohen was captured at the Nova Music Festival and fled into a 'death shelter,' into which terrorists threw grenades that caused now-deceased hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin to lose his arm. Eliya was shot in the leg and did not receive adequate medical attention from his captors in Gaza. He learned only after his release that his partner had survived the terror attack. Hamas captors made Omer Shem Tov disguise himself as a Muslim woman. He was spat on and forced to kiss terrorists in a ceremony. Shem Tov managed to maintain Jewish observance during his captivity and tried to make kiddush with whatever he had. In the final eight months, Shem Tov, Tal Shoham, and Omer Wenkert were held together in a tunnel where they endured extreme humidity and were given very little food. The hostages reported losing track of time and having no idea what month it was. Until he was placed in a tunnel with two other hostages, Wenkert had been held in complete isolation and had no idea there were efforts to free him and the other hostages. Two of the hostages, Hisham Al-Sayed and Avera Mengistu, were held for over a decade in Gaza. Al-Sayed's appearance has entirely transformed, and medical staff have reported that he is suffering from severe psychological trauma. Mengistu greeted his family but has said very little since his release.

Bibas family thanks public for ‘warm embrace, tears’	The family added that those who wish to pay their final respects to Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel can do so along the funeral route, which will be publicized. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Family members of murdered hostage Shiri Bibas and her children Kfir and Ariel issued a statement on Sunday thanking the public for its support. Yarden Bibas, the only member of his family released alive from Hamas captivity, and Dana Siton Silberman, the sister of Shiri Bibas, released a statement following the confirmation that Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel were murdered by terrorists. 'During these painful and difficult days, there are no words to describe the level of gratitude we feel towards all of you. The warm embrace, love, and strength that you have sent us from all over Israel and the world strengthen us and accompany us in these moments of crisis.' They added, 'We feel the open hearts, the immense embrace, your pain alongside ours – which we do not take for granted.' The statement continued, 'This Wednesday, we will accompany Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel on their final journey. We are aware that many of you wish to be there, to pay your respects, express your love, and say your goodbyes with us.' 'However, in order to allow the family to say their goodbyes in the most personal and intimate way, and due to space limitations, the funeral ceremony itself will be limited to family members and close friends.' The family added that those who wish to pay their final respects to Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel can do so along the funeral route, which will be publicized. Additionally, the family is coordinating live-streamed eulogies that will be available for the public to watch. The family concluded, 'We thank you all from the bottom of our hearts – for the love, the embrace, and the tears we have all shared. We do not have enough words to express our appreciation for all that you have given us during this time.'

Air Canada returns to Israel’s skies	With a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas still holding, North American air travel has steadily been returning to Israel. By Jewish Breaking News When Air Canada suspended flights last October, thousands were left navigating complex alternatives through European hubs. A brief attempt to resume service ended abruptly after Iran’s April attacks, but now the airline is committing to a steady return. Starting June 8, Air Canada’s familiar red maple leaf returns to Ben Gurion Airport, with four weekly flights scheduled for Toronto service. Montreal follows in August with a weekly connection, marking the first direct service between Canada and Israel since El Al’s withdrawal in 2022. 'Air Canada has a long-standing commitment to the Canada-Israel route, which we have operated for the past 30 years. We look forward to resuming flights and even expanding them as conditions allow,' the airline announced Thursday. With a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas still holding, North American air travel has steadily been returning to Israel. United Airlines announced resumption of service again on March 15, while Delta eyes a return on April 1. According to the Israel Airport Authority (IAA), about one-third of the 80 airlines that serviced Tel Aviv before the Gaza war have now resumed operations. Wizz Air has already rapidly expanded its network by adding seven new destinations, including Abu Dhabi, Budapest, Krakow, London, Milan, Rome, and Warsaw. Major European carriers, including Air France, British Airways, and the Lufthansa Group have also since resumed service.

Israel sent forces into the 235 sq km buffer zone to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border when Turkish-backed Islamist rebels toppled Assad government. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the demilitarization of southern Syria and protection for its Druze community on Sunday, the first time he has publicly called for this since the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime in December. 'We demand the full demilitarization of southern Syria,' said Netanyahu, who was addressing a graduation ceremony for cadet officers in Beer-Sheva. 'We will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.' Netanyahu also held up a photo of Shiri Bibas and her sons, Ariel and Kfir whose remains were recently returned to Israel. Forensics experts who examined the bodies said they had been murdered, and that there was no evidence to back Hamas claims they were killed during an Israeli airstrike. 'This picture says it all, and I ask that you engrave it on the tablet of your hearts so that we always remember what we are fighting for and who we are fighting against,' Netanyahu said. 'In the last days of the war, [Hamas] murdered Shiri and her children in cold blood. They strangled the tender children with their own hands, and if they could, they would have murdered all of us with the same cruelty,' he added. Regarding Iran, Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s long-standing stance, declaring, 'We will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.' Israel sent forces into the 235 sq km buffer zone to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border when Turkish-backed Islamist rebels toppled Assad government. Israel also launched waves of airstrikes on Syrian army assets and Iranian stockpiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of radical Islamists. Israel considers the 1974 ceasefire agreement void until order is restored in Syria. While Israeli forces have briefly entered the buffer zone in the past, December’s takeover marked the first time since its establishment that the IDF set up positions there. The demilitarized zone was established with a ceasefire in 1974 that ended the Yom Kippur War.

Israeli forces bust Jordanian weapons smuggling ring, arrest 10 s...	The leader of the network, Fuaz Altohi, 28, a resident of the Bedouin Negev town of Bir Hadaj, allegedly paid members tens of thousands of shekels for their participation. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli security forces dismantled a Jordanian weapons smuggling ring, authorities said on Sunday. Ten suspects were arrested as the Israel Defense Forces, Police and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) seized 34 pistols and four long-barreled weapons. The network’s operations focused on moving firearms from the Jordanian border into Israel and then to Judea and Samaria. 'This operation highlights the direct link between arms smuggling at the borders and the supply of weapons to Judea and Samaria, including terrorist organizations. This poses a severe threat to national security,' the Shin Bet said. According to the findings, the group executed at least two major smuggling operations in the latter half of 2024. Smugglers used vehicles crossing from Jordan to transport large quantities of weapons. The leader of the network, Fuaz Altohi, 28, a resident of the Bedouin Negev town of Bir Hadaj, allegedly paid members tens of thousands of shekels for their participation. He also collaborated with two Israeli citizens, a father and son from the Negev, to distribute the smuggled weapons. Security forces believe the weapons ended up in the hands of criminal groups and terror organizations. An indictment filed in Beer-Sheva District Court included charges of illegally possessing and trafficking firearms, damaging IDF property, facilitating illegal border crossings, and drug-related offenses. In the request for pre-trial detention, prosecutors highlighted the rising trend of illegal weapons from Jordan and Egypt flooding Israel.

Witkoff to visit Israel in bid to extend first phase of Gaza host...	Witkoff said he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'well-motivated' to see the agreement with the terrorist group continue. By JNS Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy for the Middle East, plans to return to the region later this week for talks on extending the current first phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal with the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip, he told CNN on Sunday. 'We have to get an extension of Phase 1, and so I’ll be going into the region this week, probably Wednesday, to negotiate that,' the Mideast envoy told Jake Tapper on the channel’s 'State of the Union' program. 'And we’re hopeful that we have the proper time … to begin Phase 2 and finish it off and get more hostages released,' Witkoff continued. The first 42-day phase of the truce is currently set to end on March 1. Witkoff said he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'well-motivated' to see the agreement with the terrorist group continue. 'He wants to see hostages released, that’s for sure. He also wants to protect the State of Israel. And so he’s got a red line. And he said what the red line is, and that is that Hamas cannot be involved in a governing body when this thing is resolved,' Witkoff said of the upcoming talks. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told reporters on Feb. 18 that the Israeli Cabinet has decided to start talks on Phase 2 of the ceasefire. As part of the talks, Jerusalem will demand the complete disarmament of Hamas and other terrorist organizations in the Strip, Sa’ar stressed. And as part of Phase 2, Jerusalem will reportedly also demand the release of all hostages in addition to the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza and the dismantling of its terrorist army. Officials in Jerusalem believe that Hamas is likely to reject the demands. Asked about Netanyahu’s demands, Witkoff told CNN, 'I would say at this point, for sure, they can’t be any part of governance in Gaza.' He added, 'As to existing, I’d leave that detail to the prime minister.' Trump said on Friday that it is for Jerusalem to decide whether to resume the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip or join the second round of talks to free additional captives. Asked by Brian Kilmeade on Fox News whether he was 'okay either way,' Trump answered, 'I am.' Israel on Saturday redeemed six living hostages from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip: Eliya Cohen, 27, Avera Mengistu, 39, Hisham al-Sayed, 36, Omer Shem Tov, 22, Tal Shoham, 40, and Omer Wenkert, 23. According to official estimates, 63 hostages remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza more than 500 days after the terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, 36 of which have officially been confirmed as having been murdered.

Israel challenges Egypt on secret Sinai military buildup	Cairo has constructed military bases in Sinai 'that can only be used for offensive operations, for offensive weapons—that’s a clear violation,' Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Yehiel Leiter said in a Jan. 28 briefing. By Shirit Avitan Cohen, JNS Senior Israeli officials have approached Egypt regarding serious violations of peace agreement terms following mounting evidence of Egyptian military buildup in Sinai that exceeds previously agreed limits. Sources familiar with the matter said Egyptian officials proposed U.S. mediation to reduce growing tensions between the nations. The Israeli diplomatic messages were conveyed amid increasingly concerning social media posts showing the Egyptian army allegedly conducting exercises preparing for a potential invasion of Israel through Sinai. In recent discussions between the sides, Egyptian officials expressed their own concerns, stating that 'entities with foreign interests aiming to destabilize relations between the countries are responsible for distributing the videos, some edited and some fabricated.' Egypt additionally proposed resolving its Sinai violations through accelerated bilateral dialogue to bridge gaps. These diplomatic exchanges follow last month’s remarks by Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Yehiel Leiter, who characterized the situation as 'intolerable' in a meeting with American Jewish organization leaders. Cairo has constructed military bases in Sinai 'that can only be used for offensive operations, for offensive weapons—that’s a clear violation,' Leiter said in the Jan. 28 briefing, a recording of which was shared by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Egypt’s breach 'is an issue that is going to come to the fore because it’s not tolerable,' the Israeli diplomatic envoy explained. 'For a long time, it’s been shunted aside, and this continues. This is going to be an issue that we’re going to put on the table very soon and very emphatically.' Satellite images indicating changes in Egyptian army deployment in the Sinai Peninsula have reportedly led security coordinators in Israeli border towns to paint a worrying picture of recent developments. Security and diplomatic sources confirmed Egypt’s pattern of introducing forces into Sinai in violation of agreements over the years, only requesting Israeli approval after the fact—which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu consistently granted. Yagil Henkin, a military affairs expert who first warned about concerning trends from the south in 2018, explained: 'This happened through creeping annexation. First, they would bring in forces, then retroactively request Israeli approval, which was always given. Even after operational needs ended, forces were not withdrawn.' In recent days, Cairo’s official rhetoric has escalated in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for relocating Palestinians from Gaza. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has made clear that he will not allow the move to happen, even postponing a planned visit to the White House. In his speech to the Conference of Presidents, Leiter said el-Sisi 'plays both sides of the equation, but he is threatened by the Muslim Brotherhood.' If the Israeli military decisively defeats the Muslim Brotherhood branch in the Gaza Strip—Hamas—el-Sisi is 'going to be more open to cooperate with us on the ‘day after’ Hamas,' he argued. The Israeli envoy called it 'unconscionable that Egypt wouldn’t entertain the possibility of at least temporarily housing some of the [Palestinian] refugees, particularly in light of the fact that members of Sisi’s family are running a travel agency in which they take tens of thousands of dollars from Gazans who want to get out of the area.'

‘Fear got us here, and if we don’t fight, we will lose’ – Legenda...	The Hamas-led massacre on October 7 should have been a moment of reckoning for Jews worldwide. Instead, far too many still refuse to see the truth, says prominent radio host. By Linda Argalgi Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News In a no-holds-barred conversation, legendary radio host Sid Rosenberg rips into the explosion of antisemitism, the failures of Jewish leadership, and the urgent need for Jews to take control of their own destiny. Known for his unapologetic, brass-knuckled honesty, Rosenberg isn’t here to play nice. He’s here to tell the truth: Jewish survival has never been about playing defense—it’s about fighting back. And if we don’t, we will lose everything. Jewish survival is a battle—not a birthright Jewish history isn’t defined by victimhood—it’s defined by resilience. But Rosenberg sees today’s Jewish leadership as weak and ineffective. 'When I was a kid, the JDL was tough. The ADL was tough. Neither of them is as tough as they used to be,' he says bluntly. The lesson of Jewish survival is simple: strength is the only deterrent. Yet today, too many Jews are afraid to stand up for themselves—especially those who still blindly support a party that openly harbors antisemites. 'Democrat Jews seem okay with people stepping all over them. There’s no other explanation for why they keep voting for a party that coddles Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, and AOC.' This isn’t about political preference—it’s about self-preservation. And right now, Jewish leadership is asleep at the wheel. Sid Rosenberg and author Linda Sadacka at Bedminster for a Trump Jewish Leader's event. (Courtesy) Antisemitism is institutionalized—and Jews are in denial Jew-hatred isn’t just lingering in the shadows. It’s embedded in the very institutions shaping the country. 'We see it every day at Columbia, NYU, and in Congress—Tlaib, Omar, AOC. Even Jews like Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders do a terrible job representing us,' Rosenberg states. The media only adds fuel to the fire. 'CNN spends all day crying about Palestinian ‘victims’ while barely acknowledging what happened to Jewish women and babies on October 7. It’s pure propaganda.' The greatest mistake Jewish leaders are making? Failing to recognize that antisemitism isn’t just random hate—it’s a systemic problem. 'This isn’t a fringe issue—it’s institutional,' he warns. 'And it’s time we fight it like one.' October 7th: The wake-up call that never came The Hamas-led massacre on October 7 should have been a moment of reckoning for Jews worldwide. Instead, far too many still refuse to see the truth. 'The reason October 7 happened is simple: Iran,' Rosenberg says. 'They bankroll Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. They couldn’t do it when Trump was in office because Iran was broke. The moment Biden took over, Iran was back in business.' And yet, inexplicably, Jews continue to vote for leaders who fund their executioners. 'More than 50 percent, more than 60 percent of Jews still support these policies. Was October 7 a wake-up call? Maybe for me—I became more religious, more outspoken. But for too many? They’re still asleep.' The Jewish community must stop being afraid Fear has paralyzed Jews into submission. And according to Rosenberg, that’s why attacks keep happening. 'If some thug rips a yarmulke off a kid’s head, and that kid beats the hell out of him, maybe he won’t do it again. But we don’t do that. The Jewish response has been to walk away, dejected, scared. And that’s why it keeps happening.' This isn’t about promoting violence—it’s about ensuring that threats against Jews are met with swift, unshakable resistance. 'Those who seek to harm Jews should know there will be a cost,' Rosenberg says. When enemies of the Jewish people see no consequences for their actions, when there is no pushback, no price to pay, it emboldens them. A response isn’t just necessary—it’s survival. The WZO elections: The fight for Jewish power While most people see elections through a political lens, Rosenberg views them as a battle for Jewish survival. 'This election isn’t some symbolic nonsense,' he says. 'This determines how Jewish money is spent, who gets to represent us, and whether Israel will be strong or weak.' Donald Trump is awarded the Theodor Herzl Gold Medallion at the Zionist Organization of America's 125th anniversary Gala in New York City, Nov. 13, 2022. (ZOA) The Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) World Likud is running as Slate 15 in the upcoming World Zionist Congress (WZC) elections, which will take place online from March 10 to May 4, 2025. These elections will determine how over $1 billion is allocated annually toward Jewish and Israeli causes. And the ZOA isn’t just about Jewish power—it stands by Torah values, the anchor that has kept the Jewish people rooted, protected, and unwavering throughout history. For thousands of years, it has never been politics, diplomacy, or compromise that ensured Jewish survival—it was faith, identity, and unbreakable Jewish strength. In an age where Jewish voices are under attack, where so-called leaders bend to every social pressure, ZOA stands firm: Israel is the eternal homeland of the Jewish people, and Jewish destiny will not be dictated by outsiders. Yet, this year, a new threat has emerged: a slate of brand-new groups with zero track record, no proof they can fight, and no experience in standing up for Jewish rights. 'These new slates popped up overnight. No history, no credibility. And we’re supposed to entrust them with the future of Jewish power?' Rosenberg asks. This is not the time for experiments. This is a fight for the Jewish future, and it must be waged by those who have proven their strength. How Sid got into the fight: 'Linda, you were relentless' Rosenberg wasn’t planning to join this battle—he was dragged into it by people who refused to take no for an answer. 'Linda, you were relentless,' he laughs. 'You sent Elizabeth Pipko, Elisheva Chase, and others after me. You made the calls. But in the end, it was Siggy Flicker—my good friend—who sealed the deal. And I’m damn glad she did, because ZOA is the real deal.' For Rosenberg, this isn’t about just another election—it’s about who actually fights for Jewish power. 'A lot of groups just talk—they hold rallies, tweet, and put out statements. But what does that actually accomplish? Nothing.' 'ZOA fights where it matters—in Congress, in court, on the front lines for Israel and the Jewish people.' Real fighters vs. social media celebrities Rosenberg has no patience for performative activism. 'There are people out there making a fortune off this since October 7. They love the photo ops. They have millions of followers. But the real fighters? They’re not the ones tweeting—they’re the ones actually in the trenches.' Ava Rosenberg with her father Sid Rosenberg, a prominent national radio show host. (Courtesy) For him, the ultimate example of Jewish courage isn’t an influencer—it’s his own daughter, Ava. 'What impresses me? Not influencers lighting menorahs with Van Jones for $50,000 a pop. It’s my daughter, Ava. She’s on a college campus, putting her life on the line for the Jewish people when it’s dangerous, when it’s damn near deadly. That’s leadership.' Final message: Fight or be erased Jewish history does not reward weakness. It rewards strength, defiance, and the courage to fight back. We are not guests in this world. We are not here to beg for approval, apologize for our existence, or tiptoe around the sensibilities of those who hate us. The Torah is our anchor. It is the foundation that has carried us through every exile, every war, every attempt to erase us. It commands us to be strong, to fight for our people, and to never surrender our destiny to others. The battle lines have been drawn. The enemy is emboldened. Jewish survival has never been guaranteed—it has always been earned. So stand up. Speak out. Vote. Fight back. Because if we don’t fight for ourselves, no one else will.

Trump’s pick for UN envoy uses CPAC speech to call for ‘eradicati...	‘It has never been more important to show unequivocal support for Israel,’ says New York congresswoman tapped by President Trump to serve as Ambassador to the United Nations. ‘Never forget that Hamas terrorists savagely murdered 1,200 innocents.' By World Israel News Staff A Republican lawmaker tapped by President Donald Trump to serve as America’s ambassador to the United Nations used her speech at the largest annual gathering of conservative activists to reaffirm support for Israel and to call for the ‘eradication’ of the Hamas terror organization. New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland on Saturday, lauding President Trump’s position on the Israel-Hamas conflict while lambasting the United Nations relief agency UNRWA. Amid accusations of ties to terrorism – including to Hamas and terrorists involved in the October 7th invasion – Stefanik called to 'dismantle' the agency. 'Make no mistake. Hear it now,' Stefanik told CPAC attendees. 'We will not only defund UNRWA, we will dismantle it,' calling the UN agency a 'pro-Hamas terrorist group that committed atrocities on Oct. 7.' During his first term as president, Trump defunded UNRWA, a move which was later reversed by his successor, President Joe Biden. However, in 2024, following revelations of involvement by UNRWA employees in the October 7th massacres, the Biden White House suspended funding for UNRWA, while finding alternative mechanisms for supporting international aid to Palestinians in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. While the Biden-era freeze is slated to expire next month, UNRWA funding is also restricted by a January 20th executive order signed by Trump after returning to office, freezing nearly all foreign aid. Stefanik called for the ‘eradication’ of Hamas, citing the murder of Israeli hostages returned to Israel last week – including three members of the Bibas family. 'It has never been more important to show the world’s unequivocal support for Israel. We will not rest until every hostage is brought home and Hamas is eradicated.' 'This past week, we continue to see with crystal clarity that our fight to support Israel and eradicate Hamas is a fight between good and evil, light and darkness, life and death.' 'The world must never forget that Hamas terrorists savagely murdered over 1,200 innocent civilians—including women, children, the elderly and babies—and took hundreds hostage, committing unspeakable atrocities against humanity.'

40,000 Palestinians evacuated as IDF deploys tanks in Samaria	For the first time since 2002, IDF tanks roll into Jenin as Israeli Defense Minister signals Israel will maintain long-term presence in the city, noting 40,000 Palestinians evacuated. By World Israel News Staff IDF tanks rolled into the Palestinian Authority city of Jenin in northern Samaria on Sunday, marking the first time since the Second Intifada that Israeli armored units have operated in the area. On Sunday morning, photographs and video began circulating on social media outlets showing Israeli Merkava main battle tanks being deployed to Jenin and nearby Arab villages. An IDF spokesperson later confirmed that tanks were operating in the area as part of the ongoing Israeli counter-terror operation in Samaria. Since January 21st, Israeli forces have killed more than 70 terrorists and detained 300 suspects in Operation Iron Wall, carried out in the Jenin district of northern Samaria and Tulkarem and the nearby Nur al-Shams in western Samaria. The operation was launched after Palestinian Authority security forces failed to take control of Jenin from rogue terror groups, and following the January 6th shooting attack in Samaria that left three Israelis dead. Later on Sunday, Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) discussed the expansion of Operation Iron Wall, saying that some 40,000 Arab residents have been evacuated from the targeted areas. 'The IDF is expanding its operations in northern Samaria and, as of last night, is also operating in the town of Qabatiya as part of Operation Iron Wall to combat terrorism in Judea and Samaria. The military is reinforcing its forces with armored units and additional troops,' Katz said in a statement. 'So far, 40,000 Palestinians have evacuated from the refugee camps of Jenin, Tulkarm, and Nur al-Shams, which are now empty of residents.' Furthermore, Katz said the Israeli military will remain in parts of Jenin and Tulkarem for an extended period of time, without giving a deadline for their withdrawal. 'We are at war against Islamic terrorism in Judea and Samaria. I have instructed the IDF to prepare for a prolonged stay in the cleared camps for the coming year—to prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism.' During the recent operations, Katz added, IDF forces have shut down operations by the terror-linked United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). 'UNRWA operations in the camps have also been halted.' 'We will not return to the previous reality. We will continue to clear refugee camps and additional terror hubs to dismantle the battalions and terror infrastructure of radical Islam, which were built, armed, funded, and trained by Iran's axis of evil in an attempt to establish an eastern terror front against the settlements of Samaria, the security barrier, and major population centers in Israel.'

For the first time since 2002, IDF tanks roll into Jenin as Israeli Defense Minister signals Israel will maintain long-term presence in the city, noting 40,000 Palestinians evacuated. By World Israel News Staff IDF tanks rolled into the Palestinian Authority city of Jenin in northern Samaria on Sunday, marking the first time since the Second Intifada that Israeli armored units have operated in the area. On Sunday morning, photographs and video began circulating on social media outlets showing Israeli Merkava main battle tanks being deployed to Jenin and nearby Arab villages. An IDF spokesperson later confirmed that tanks were operating in the area as part of the ongoing Israeli counter-terror operation in Samaria. Since January 21st, Israeli forces have killed more than 70 terrorists and detained 300 suspects in Operation Iron Wall, carried out in the Jenin district of northern Samaria and Tulkarem and the nearby Nur al-Shams in western Samaria. The operation was launched after Palestinian Authority security forces failed to take control of Jenin from rogue terror groups, and following the January 6th shooting attack in Samaria that left three Israelis dead. Later on Sunday, Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) discussed the expansion of Operation Iron Wall, saying that some 40,000 Arab residents have been evacuated from the targeted areas. 'The IDF is expanding its operations in northern Samaria and, as of last night, is also operating in the town of Qabatiya as part of Operation Iron Wall to combat terrorism in Judea and Samaria.

Terrorist murderer dies in accident days after release	Na'el Obeid, a terrorist convicted of seven murders for role in suicide bombing attack, dies in accident at his Jerusalem home, just days after he was released as part of the hostage deal between Hamas and Israel. By World Israel News Staff A convicted terrorist from Jerusalem, responsible for a deadly terrorist attack more than two decades ago, died over the weekend in an accident just days after he was released from prison. Last week, Israel’s Prison Service released Na’el Obeid, a Jerusalem resident convicted during the Second Intifada of helping to carry out a suicide bombing at an Israeli café in the capital. The September 2003 Café Hillel bombing left seven Israelis dead and 57 more injured. The victims killed in the suicide bombing attack included two Americans: Dr. David Applebaum and his daughter, Nava Applebaum, who was murdered on the eve of her wedding. Other victims of the bombing include, David Shimon Avizadris, Shafik Kerem, Alon Mizrachi, Gila Moshe, and Yehiel Tubol. Following his capture, Obeid was tried and convicted for his role in planning the attack and aiding the suicide bomber. Obeid was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences, plus 30 years in prison. Prior to his release last week, Obeid had served 21 years of his sentence. In exchange for the release of three Israeli civilians freed on February 15th – including Sagui Dekel-Chen, Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov, and Iair Horn – Israel released 369 jailed Arab terrorists, including Obeid, who returned to his home in the Issawiya neighborhood of eastern Jerusalem. This Saturday, however, Obeid was rushed to Hadassah Medical Center on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem after he suffered critical injuries. Obeid was reportedly injured after falling from the roof of a building Issawiya. After being evacuated to the hospital in critical condition, Obeid was later declared dead by doctors at Hadassah.

Pope is conscious, receiving supplemental oxygen, had a peaceful ...	His condition has revived speculation about what might happen if he becomes unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, and whether he might resign. By The Associated Press Pope Francis was conscious but still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen Sunday following a respiratory crisis and blood transfusions, as he remains in critical condition with a complex lung infection, the Vatican said. The brief statement early Sunday didn't mention if Francis was out of bed or eating breakfast, which it had on previous days. 'The night passed quietly, the pope rested,' it said. The Vatican later said Francis was conscious, continuing to receive supplemental oxygen and that further clinical tests were being conducted. A more detailed medical update was expected later Sunday. On Saturday, doctors said the 88-year-old pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was in critical condition after suffering a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection. The pope received 'high flows' of oxygen to help him breathe through a nasal tube. He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, the Vatican said in a late update. The Saturday statement also said that the pontiff 'continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more discomfort than yesterday.' Doctors said the prognosis was 'reserved.' Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. His condition has revived speculation about what might happen if he becomes unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, and whether he might resign. Prayers for pope at Vatican Francis was supposed to have celebrated Mass on Sunday morning in St. Peter's Basilica and ordained deacons as part of the Vatican's yearlong Holy Year commemoration. The organizer of the Holy Year, Archbishop Rino Fisichella, celebrated the Mass in his place and offered a special prayer for Francis from the altar before delivering the homily the pope had prepared. 'Even though he is in a hospital bed, we feel Pope Francis close to us, we feel him present among us,' Fisichella told the hundreds of white-robed deacons. 'And this compels us to make even stronger and more intense our prayer that the Lord will assist him in his time of trial and illness.' A pre-written message that Francis had prepared for his Sunday noon prayer but did not deliver said he was 'confidently continuing my hospitalization at the Gemelli Hospital, carrying on with the necessary treatment; and rest is also part of the therapy!' The message noted the upcoming anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 'a painful and shameful occasion for the whole of humanity.' The main threat facing the pope is sepsis Doctors have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. Saturday’s blood tests showed that he had developed a low platelet count, a condition called platelopenia or thrombocytopenia. Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal. Low platelet counts can be caused by a number of things, including side effects from medicines or infections, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Francis, who has chronic lung disease and is prone to bronchitis in winter, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Vatican hierarchy tamps down speculation Francis might resign Meanwhile, the Vatican hierarchy went on the defensive to tamp down rumors and speculation that Francis might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to speculation and rumors about a possible resignation. It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret. Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat-out denied that any such meeting occurred. Parolin said such speculation seemed 'useless' when what really mattered was the health of Francis, his recovery and return to the Vatican.

Israeli hostages forced to watch as other captives set free	Hamas released a propaganda video of Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David forced to watch from a van Saturday as other hostages were released. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Two hostages were forced by Hamas to watch its choreographed ceremony in which three Israelis were released Saturday in Rafah, and were filmed begging repeatedly for their own freedom. Looking extremely gaunt, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, dressed identically in light sweaters in the freezing cold, can be seen in a van first covering their eyes with their hands in disbelief as they watch Omer Shem Tov, Tal Shoham and Omer Wenkert up on a stage being forced to speak before being taken to Red Cross vehicles. Sitting across from well-armed terrorists, the two then face the camera and say, 'Please save us, bring us home, I’m begging you.' They are cruelly asked in Hebrew, 'How do you feel right now?' and they repeat with tears in their voices, 'Please let us go home, we’ve been here 500 days, please save us&#8230; we want to be like them,' nodding at the Israelis being humiliated in the handover ceremony. The door of the van is then slammed shut and they say to the camera in separate shots that have been obviously pieced together, '[Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, you’ve finished us off, you killed us here&#8230; We need proper negotiations, simply sign on a deal and finish this, we’ve just seen our friends released after 500 days, [if you use] military pressure, we’ll all die&#8230;. People of Israel, don’t stop demonstrating, it is so hard for us here.' Right-wing members of the government have been demanding that the IDF return to crush Hamas instead of agreeing to a Phase 2 where the IDF would fully withdraw from Gaza in return for the 63 remaining hostages, only 27 of whom are still alive. Galia David, Evyatar’s mother, was interviewed Sunday by several radio stations after the two- minute clip was released. She told Army Radio that while 'it was obvious that he had been staged,' her son was still obviously 'frightened and frustrated' and that 'his whole body language expressed distress.' David was relieved that her son was at least with his close friend in captivity, saying that it was a 'consolation' that he and Gilboa-Dalal were 'alive and together,' and adding that 'I have no doubt that they give each other a great deal of strength.' 'But I see the soul through his eyes and he is tormented, my son is tormented. He is pale and thin, but we keep saying - the body can be healed, the soul is much more difficult,' she said. 'We must save them, and as quickly as possible. If it doesn’t happen now, I don’t know how much longer they can hang on there.' On Channel 12, she also slammed Hamas’ malice, noting that the terrorists 'let him look at his friends who were with him in the tunnels and are going home, and then sent back to the darkness to wander in the tunnels when he doesn't know what's happening to him. This is simply cruelty.' Hamas terrorists abducted Gilboa-Dalal and David from the Nova festival on October 7, 2023, among 249 others during their invasion of Israel in which they slaughtered 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians.

US Rep. Nancy Mace torches colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for...	Mace was responding to an April 2024 clip from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, in which Ocasio-Cortez accused Israel of inflicting a famine on Gaza as revenge for Oct. 7. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner US Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) has lambasted fellow Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) over her previous suggestions that the United States cut funding to Israel for humanitarian purposes. Mace posted on social media that she is currently visiting Israel to witness the aftermath of the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks which left roughly 1,200 dead and 250 abducted. 'I’m in Israel where last night 3 buses were bombed. I’m here to see the evil that invaded Israel and deeply harmed her Jewish people on 10/7,' Mace wrote. 'We gave $9 billion in humanitarian and disaster aid for Gaza last year – at least half of which, $4.5 billion since AOC can’t count, ended up funding terrorism. Our resources have enabled mass terrorism in Gaza and elsewhere. See UN and USAID as additional examples,' Mace continued. 'Also – what’s democracy to terrorists who want to kill all Jews and Christians. Move to Gaza since you and your caucus love Hamas so much.' Observers have argued that humanitarian funding for Gaza, including money from the US, often ends up going to the Hamas terrorist group, the most powerful and organized faction in the Palestinian enclave. Many countries, including the US, have paused funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which is responsible for Palestinian refugees and their descendants, for harboring close ties to Hamas terrorists. The Israeli government and research organizations have publicized findings showing numerous UNRWA-employed staff, including teachers and school principals, directly participated in the Oct. 7 attacks. Mace was responding to an April 2024 clip from 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,' in which Ocasio-Cortez accused Israel of inflicting a famine on Gaza as revenge for Oct. 7. The firebrand progressive accused Israel of 'human rights' violations in Gaza and argued that the Jewish state has undermined Palestinian 'civil rights.' Ocasio-Cortez lamented that 'US taxpayer assistance' has helped facilitate what she considers a dereliction of American values. 'It’s not just about Israel. It’s not just about Gaza. This is about us, because this is US taxpayer assistance and what is being financed with our resources, and if any conflict is going to have US resources, then it does become a matter of our values,' Ocasio-Cortez said to Stephen Colbert. She then called on the United States to reaffirm its 'commitment to human rights, to the sanctity of civil rights, to the rules of war' by canceling arms transfers to Israel. Over the past year, Ocasio-Cortez has repeatedly condemned the Jewish state’s response to the Hamas terrorist group’s brutal Oct. 7 slaughter of roughly 1,200 people throughout southern Israel. She has accused the Jewish state of committing a 'genocide' and 'ethnic cleansing' in Gaza, arguing that the conflict has been 'generationally radicalizing' for young Americans. She has also boasted of leading a 'whip operation' to garner votes from fellow Democrats to block aid to Israel. Since entering Congress in 2021, Mace has often defended Israel. Earlier this week, Mace repudiated Palestinian American supermodel Bella Hadid for holding a map that depicts the elimination of Israel. In May 2024, Mace defended Israel’s military conduct in Gaza as 'biblical warfare,' and she has slammed her Democratic colleagues for not being more outspoken about the widespread rapes of Israeli women during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 rampage. 'I can’t think of anything more shameful than to see these women’s groups, to see women on the left, women in the House, my colleagues on the left who refuse to say what this is, which is shameful. It’s disgusting. It’s barbaric,' she said. 'And we ought to be condemning it from every corner of our country. Every woman should be condemning this. And I think it’s shameful.' The post US Rep.

Tanks seen in Jenin area for first time in over 20 years as Israe...	Since January 19, Israeli forces have arrested more than 200 terror suspects, eliminated 71 others who were deemed security threats, and confiscated more than 300 weapons and explosives. By Ehud Amiton, TPS Israeli tanks were seen in the area of Jenin on Sunday as the Israel Defense Forces confirmed it was expanding its counterterror operations in northern Samaria. It marked the first deployment of tanks in Judea and Samaria since 2002. This deployment follows the Thursday night bombings of buses in Bat Yam and Holon. In a rare visit to the Tulkarem refugee camp on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to escalate the fight. 'In the past year, we have greatly increased our activity,' Netanyahu said as he visited troops and was briefed by commanders. 'We are entering the terrorist strongholds, clearing entire streets used by terrorists, their homes. We are eliminating terrorists and commanders.' Nobody was killed in Thursday night’s bombings. On one bus, a passenger noticed a suspicious unattended bag with wires sticking out and Arabic writing. She alerted the driver who evacuated the vehicle. Three other buses were blown up in separate bus depots while another unexploded bomb was found on another bus. The words, 'Revenge from Tulkarem' were found written in Arabic on one of the bags. An Israeli Jew, a Palestinian, and a third suspect were reportedly arrested on Friday for the attacks on buses. The Israel Defense Forces launched an ongoing counterterror raid in the Jenin refugee camp on Jan. 19. It has since expanded to the Palestinian city Tulkarem and an area of Samaria known as 'the Five Villages.' The raids, dubbed 'Operation Iron Wall,' come on the heels of the Palestinian Authority’s failed crackdown in the Jenin refugee camp. Troops have arrested around 200 terror suspects, seized weapons and explosives, and uncovered a bomb-making laboratory. Since January 19, Israeli forces have arrested more than 200 terror suspects, eliminated 71 others who were deemed security threats, and confiscated more than 300 weapons and explosives. In Jenin, a suspect was apprehended after being caught handling explosive devices. A subsequent search revealed a cache of 20 ready-to-use explosives and a grenade body at a construction site. Since the October 7 attacks, Israeli forces have arrested 6,000 wanted Palestinians in counterterror operations in Judea and Samaria. Around 40 percent were affiliated with Hamas.

IDF strikes Hezbollah targets ahead of Nasrallah’s funeral in Bei...	The IDF on Saturday night struck a Syria-Lebanon border crossing through which Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah was attempting to smuggle weapons, according to the Israeli military. By JNS The Israeli military on Sunday struck a Hezbollah site in Lebanon, targeting rocket launchers and weapons. Several rocket launchers in Southern Lebanon which posed an imminent threat to Israeli civilians were also neutralized, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The military stated that Hezbollah’s continued actions violate established understandings between Jerusalem and Beirut and endanger the State of Israel and its citizens. The IDF emphasized that it remains committed to eliminating any threats against Israel. The operation came just hours before Hezbollah prepares to bury its former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh. According to Israel’s Channel 12 News, Israeli drones were reportedly observed flying over the Lebanese capital as preparations for the funeral intensified. Nasrallah, who led the Iranian terror proxy for over three decades, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sept. 27. The funeral ceremony is scheduled to take place in the afternoon at Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, Lebanon’s largest sports arena, with tens of thousands expected to attend. IDF strikes Hezbollah smuggling routes on Lebanon-Syria border The IDF on Saturday night struck a Syria-Lebanon border crossing through which Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah was attempting to smuggle weapons, according to the Israeli military. The IDF called these attempts a 'blatant violation' of the ceasefire between Jerusalem and Beirut and vowed to 'prevent any attempt by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to rebuild its forces.' Saturday’s strike came after the Israeli Air Force overnight Thursday attacked several border crossings it said were being used by Hezbollah to smuggle in weapons. A day earlier, an Israeli drone strike on a vehicle in Ayta al-Shaab in Southern Lebanon killed an armed Hezbollah terrorist, according to the IDF. That strike in turn came a day after the deadline for a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory under the U.S.-brokered Israel-Lebanon ceasefire went into effect on Nov. 27. Last Monday, the IDF confirmed that troops would remain deployed at five strategic outposts in Southern Lebanon, citing the Lebanese Armed Forces’ failure to fully deploy in the area in place of Hezbollah, as required by the terms of the truce. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday vowed to continue to act against Hezbollah 'at full strength.' 'We will not allow a return to the reality of Oct. 7,' he declared, referring to the 2023 Hamas-led massacre in Israel’s south.

Following murder of child hostages, Argentina mulls renaming Pale...	Argentina's capital city to consider measure which would rename Buenos Aires' State of Palestine Street after the Argentinian-Israeli children murdered while in captivity in the Gaza Strip. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Argentina's capital city is considering renaming a street after victims of the Hamas terror organization who were killed while in captivity in the Gaza Strip. Last week, Yamil Santoro, a city councillor in Buenos Aires, drafted a measure which would, if passed, rename the 'State of Palestine Street,' (Estado de Palestina) changing it to 'Bibas Family Street,' (Familia Bibas), in honor of the three members of the Argentinian-Israeli family who were murdered by Hamas terrorists while in captivity in the Gaza Strip. On Thursday, Hamas returned the remains of the two sons of Yarden and Shiri Bibas - Kfir and Ariel - the two youngest hostages abducted from Israel on October 7th. After falsely presenting the remains of another woman as the body of their mother, Shiri, Hamas returned Shiri Bibas' remains over the weekend. While Yarden, a dual Israeli-Argentinian national, was returned alive to Israel earlier this month, his wife and children - who received Argentinian citizenship through their father - were apparently killed in November 2023. Israeli forensics examiners say it appears the two Bibas children were murdered by terrorists who used their bare hands, refuting Hamas' claims they were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Mrs. Bibas' remains also showed no signs her injuries were caused by an airstrike. 'We are introducing a bill to change the name of the street from 'Palestine' to 'Bibas Family,'' Santoro announced last Thursday. 'It is essential to remember and honor the victims of terrorism.' 'Without prejudice to this idea/proposal, if you believe there is another initiative we can promote from the Buenos Aires Legislature to honor the victims and combat terrorism, I would like to hear it.' The street in question, located in Buenos Aires' Almagro neighborhood, was renamed 'State of Palestine Street' in December 2013, after previously being simply called 'Palestine Street,' a symbolic gesture of recognition of unilateral Palestinian statehood. 'State of Palestine, understood as the government that was established to look after its interests, was co-opted by the terrorist group Hamas and has led to us being faced with a failed state that prioritizes the search for the extermination of its neighbors,' Santoro said. 'Recognizing a failed state, appropriated by terrorism, is a deliberate act of forgetting and omitting the atrocities committed.' In addition to political opposition, the measure will face technical hurdles, owing to a 1998 law which prohibits naming public areas after people who have been dead for less than 10 years. Santoro hopes that by naming the street after the Bibas family, rather than individual members of the family, his measure can skirt the restriction. Buenos Aires is not the only city in Argentina, or even in the State of Buenos Aires, with a street named 'Palestine.' In November 2022, Santa Clara del Mar, a municipality in the State of Buenos Aires, renamed a main road 'Palestine Street' in recognition of the 34th anniversary of the Palestine Liberation Organization's declaration of statehood in November 1988.

Hostage was ‘broken by Hamas,’ says father	Hisham al-Sayed, a hostage of Hamas for almost a decade, 'does not communicate' and is in 'a very bad state,' said his father. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hisham al-Sayed, who was released Saturday after being a prisoner of Hamas for two months short of a decade, was broken by Hamas and is in poor mental condition, his father told Hebrew-language media Saturday. Al-Sayed, who had reportedly been diagnosed with schizophrenia and a personality disorder in his youth and was institutionalized several times, was not forced to participate in a humiliating release ceremony. He was simply brought to a Red Cross vehicle in Gaza City which then drove him over to IDF forces who took him to Ichilov Hospital to be examined and meet his family. A Hamas official told Al-Jazeera that this was done out of 'respect for his family and the Arabs of Israel,' and because he has Palestinian roots,' but the family rejected the statement out of hand. 'He was in a torture camp,' Al-Sayed’s father Shaaban told Ynet. 'They didn't want people to see what condition he was in, so there was no ceremony.' 'Hamas are liars,' he added. 'If they had any respect for people, they would have released him a long time ago&#8230;. As a Muslim, I am furious with Hamas.' Speculating that his son had been isolated while in captivity, Shaaban said his son returned 'broken and is in a very bad state. He almost doesn’t speak, and if he does, it’s only in a whisper, and he lowers his head.' In an interview with Channel 12, he excoriated Hamas again. Hisham 'is not well, he was not in our world. A kind of Tarzan after living for 10 years with animals. He does not communicate,' he said. 'He tries to talk and to share, but he doesn’t succeed,' the father added. 'He says a lot of incomprehensible things. He speaks in a whisper, maybe out of fear. I believe he is in a state of mental torture.' In videos released of his family greeting him in the hospital, al-Sayed can be seen with a completely expressionless face, being hugged briefly by one person after another. A few members said he should have been freed together with the other hostages. 'There should be no difference between him and the Jewish hostages. It makes us feel like he is better than them but for us each of the hostages is important, regardless of his faith,' they said. Jewish Ethiopian-Israeli Avera Mengistu, who also suffered from mental problems and had wandered into Gaza in 2014, was freed in a ceremony in Rafah along with Tal Shoham, a resident of Kibbutz Be’eri whom Hamas had abducted on October 7, 2023, along with 250 others during their invasion of southern Israel. Hisham had attempted to get into Gaza several times before 2015 during long walks he took alone. He often went where he shouldn’t, according to an earlier statement by his father to Human Rights Watch. 'He likes the attention when he goes places he knows are forbidden,' Shaaban said, noting that he had also twice crossed illegally into Jordan, and had even once succeeded in entering the Gaza Strip. 'In 2010, he went to Gaza too, and the Bedouins we know there helped return him within 24 hours,' he said. 'But the Hamas leadership changed in 2014 and his luck ran out.'

Israeli prime minister denies report that top security official lobbied Netanyahu to approve plan to assassinate Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas forces in Gaza, less than a week before the October 7th invasion. By World Israel News Staff A top Israeli security official presented Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a plan to assassinate the senior Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip just days before the October 7th, 2023 invasion, a report by Israel's Channel 12 claims. According to the report Saturday night, on October 1st, 2023, Ronen Bar, chief of the Shin Bet internal security agency, lobbied Netanyahu to approve the targeted assassination of Yahya Sinwar, the de facto ruler of the Gaza Strip and mastermind of the invasion of Israel, launched just six days after the plan was reportedly proposed to Netanyahu. Netanyahu is said to have ignored Bar's request to green light the targeted killing. Channel 12 claimed that Saturday's report was based on material collected by the Shin Bet from its own probe into the security failures ahead of and during the October 7th invasion. Among other things, the probe reportedly found that the Shin Bet underestimated the capabilities of Hamas' elite Nukhba Force, which spearheaded the October 7th invasion. As such, the agency did not address warnings of an impending invasion. However, the report states that despite the agency's failure to properly assess the threat posed by the Nukhba Force in the days and hours leading up to the invasion, successive heads of the Shin Bet are said to have warned of Hamas' growing military capabilities and urged the government to carry out targeted killings of senior Hamas officials in Gaza, including Sinwar and Muhammed Deif, chief of Hamas' military wing. Since September of 2023, according the report, the Shin Bet deliberated on steps to increase overall security readiness vis-a-vis a possible campaign in Gaza. On October 1st, during an operational meeting with senior security officials, Bar reportedly advised Netanyahu to okay the Shin Bet's plan to assassinate Sinwar. The Prime Minister's Office, however, vociferously denied the claim, which it denounced as a 'complete lie.' 'The truth is the exact opposite. On the 1st of October 2023, Prime Minister Netanyahu held a situational assessment on the subject of Gaza, during which the Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar recommended that [Israel] grant Hamas benefits to [Gaza] civilians in exchange for quiet.' 'Bar even said that targeted killings should be avoided in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon, in order to prevent another round of [fighting] in Gaza.' The PMO added that two days later, on October 3rd, Bar argued that Hamas was working to avoid a conflict with Israel, claiming that it was possible to maintain long-term stability between Israel and Gaza. Saturday night's report and the PMO's response come amid reports Netanyahu is planning to replace Bar as Shin Bet chief - a claim the PMO has denied. Critics of the prime minister have linked his alleged plan to fire Bar after the Shin Bet completes its ongoing probe of the October 7th security failures to the agency's investigation into ties between several Netanyahu aides in the Prime Minister's Office and the Qatari government. According to recent reports, several public relations officials from the PMO were paid by Doha to improve Qatar's image in Israel.

Trump: ‘Disgraceful’ how Hamas is treating Israeli hostages	President Trump laments poor condition of Israeli hostages returned from the Gaza Strip, blames Biden for October 7th invasion and failure to bring back the hostages. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump castigated the Hamas terror organization over the weekend, citing its abuse of Israeli hostages held in captivity in the Gaza Strip. Speaking with reporters briefly before departing the White House Saturday for an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, the president lamented that the six Israeli hostages returned to Israel from the Gaza Strip earlier in the day appeared to be 'not in great shape.' 'We had a lot of news over the last 24 hours. We had the hostages given back today, it’s disgraceful what’s going on there,' Trump said. 'They’re not in great shape, but we’ve also seen them in worse shape. What a terrible situation it is.' Later that day, during his CPAC address, Trump blamed his predecessor for the October 7th invasion, reiterating previous claims that the Biden White House's softening of economic measures against Iran, including the unfreezing of Iranian assets and sanctions waivers, had enabled Tehran to fund proxy groups including Hamas and Hezbollah. 'October 7th - Israel - would have never happened if I was president. It would have never happened. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah. They had no money to give. Everybody knows that. Jewish people in the audience know that. Iran was broke. They were not giving money around.' 'When I got out [of office], [the Biden administration] took all the sanctions off, and Iran became rich very quickly. With oil, you can become rich very, very quickly. And the rest is history. What a horrible thing.' Trump also accused Biden of failing to secure the release of any hostages taken on October 7th, 2023. 'Even though the hostages are coming back, I saw this morning that we got six more back. Biden got none, by the way&#8230;none, zero. He would have never gotten any of them back.' 'But they're coming back in pretty bad shape. It's a horrible thing. And many are dead. Many are dead. So we'll see how that all ends up. But I just want you to know we're working on that.' In November 2023, Hamas released 105 hostages - including 81 Israeli nationals - as part of a ceasefire deal brokered by Qatar, Egypt, and the Biden administration.

Prisoner releases indefinitely halted until hostage ceremonies st...	600 Palestinian prisoners waited on buses for hours, before being told their release was delayed and they needed to return to their cells. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indefinitely delayed the release of Palestinian prisoners, including those who were expected to be released Saturday following the return of six living Israeli hostages, according to a government statement. On Saturday, Hamas held two separate ceremonies in which they paraded five frail Israeli hostages in front of cheering crowds, ahead of their transfer to the Red Cross. During one of the ceremonies, Omer Shem Tov, who was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival, was forced to kiss his captor on the forehead. 'In light of the repeated violations by Hamas — including the ceremonies that demean our hostages’ dignity and the cynical use of our hostages for propaganda purposes — it has been decided to delay the release of terrorists planned for yesterday until the next release of hostages is guaranteed, and without the humiliating ceremonies,' read a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, which was released at 1 a.m. on Sunday. Notably, the sole non-Jewish captive freed on Saturday - Hisham a-Sayyid, a Bedouin Muslim-Israeli held by Hamas for more than a decade - was privately handed over to the Red Cross without a public ceremony. The Hamas terror group said in a statement that it transferred a-Sayyid without fanfare 'out of respect for his honor and the honor of Arab-Israelis.' According to Hebrew-language media reports, some 600 Palestinian prisoners had already been boarded onto buses at Ofer Prison Saturday when the announcement came that their release was indefinitely postponed. After waiting for hours on the buses, they were instructed to disembark and return to their cells. Beyond the ceremony held on Saturday, Israel's delay is likely influenced by the botched return of the Bibas' families bodies. On Thursday, Hamas claimed that it transferred the bodies of Shiri Bibas and her sons, Kfir and Ariel, to the Red Cross, along with the body of octogenarian hostage Oded Lifshitz. While DNA testing confirmed the identities of Lifshitz and the Bibas children, the remains of the adult woman were found to not be of Shiri Bibas. Late Friday evening, Hamas returned Shiri Bibas' body. Forensic analysis determined that the Bibas family were brutally murdered by their terrorist captors. Defense Minister Israel Katz said that their murders will 'not be taken lightly.'

Forensic evidence confirms Shiri Bibas not killed by IDF airstrik...	Our examination found no injuries consistent with a bombing,' says IDF. By JNS A forensic analysis of Shiri Bibas’s body found no evidence linking her death to an Israeli airstrike, contrary to claims made by Hamas. Her corpse was positively identified by Dr. Chen Kugel, director of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Abu Kabir) in Tel Aviv. 'We identified Shiri Bibas two days after confirming the identities of her two young children, Kfir and Ariel,' Kugel stated on Saturday. 'Our examination found no injuries consistent with a bombing.' Hamas had long alleged that Bibas and her children were killed in an IDF airstrike in Gaza. However, the forensic findings directly contradict that narrative. 'We were met with depths of evil and malice that could not be conceived,' added Kugel. On Thursday, Hamas returned the bodies of Shiri’s children, Kfir and Ariel, along with that of octogenarian Oded Lifshitz. However, the fourth body freed from Gaza, which Hamas said was that of Shiri Bibis, was found to belong to an unidentified woman. Shiri Bibas’s remains were returned to Israel from Gaza on Friday night. Hamas transferred her body to the Red Cross, which then handed it over to the IDF. The military brought her remains to the National Institute of Forensic Medicine for definitive identification and examination. 'This is a difficult day for us and for all citizens of Israel,' Kugel concluded. Forensic analysis of Kfir and Ariel also showed that they were murdered in cold blood by their Gaza captors. The IDF said that the Palestinian terrorists committed the crime 'with their bare hands' weeks after being taken captive on Oct. 7, 2023. On Oct. 7, 2023, Gazan terrorists stormed Kibbutz Nir Oz. They breached the Bibas family home’s door using a drill and other equipment and entered the safe room where the four were hiding. Father Yarden reported the attack to his wider family in real-time, texting that 'it feels like the end.' The video of Shiri’s kidnapping—terrified and trying to protect her two children with her arms as she was surrounded by masked men with weapons—became a symbol of the Oct. 7 massacre. Shiri’s parents, Yossi and Margit Silberman, were murdered that day. Yarden Bibas was freed on Feb. 1 after 484 days in Hamas captivity. According to the Israeli government, 63 hostages are remaining in Gaza, with 36 classified as deceased and 27 alive. Another four bodies are slated for release this coming Thursday.

Who are the 4 deceased hostages being released Thursday?	The bodies of Ohad Yahalomi, Tsahi Idan, Itzik Elgarat, and Shlomo Mantzur are expected to return to Israel this Thursday. By World Israel News Staff The bodies of four deceased Israeli hostages are expected to be returned to Israel this Thursday, marking the final exchange of the first phase of the ongoing hostage deal. Ohad Yahalomi, 49, Tsahi Idan, 49, Itzik Elgarat, 68, and Shlomo Mantzur, 85, were all kidnapped from their homes in southern Israel on October 7th, 2023. While all of the men are now believed to be dead, at least two of them are believed to have been abducted alive. Yahalomi engaged in a gun battle with Hamas terrorists, sitting outside of his home's safe room in Kibbutz Nir Oz, in order to protect his family. He was shot in the leg by terrorists. His wife and two of his children were able to escape, while his 12-year-old son, Eitan, was captured by terrorists. Eitan Yahalomi was released in a December 2023 hostage deal, but his father remained in the Strip. The Yahalomi family has insisted that the wounds Ohad sustained were survivable. Idan was not injured during his abduction from Kibbutz Nahal Oz, indicating that he was murdered in captivity. According to eyewitness testimony from Idan's wife, the father-of-three was kidnapped alive. Terrorists had stormed their home, firing through their safe room door and killing 18-year-old Ma'ayan Idan, who died in her father's arms. Gali Idan managed to protect her other two children, but the terrorists abducted her husband. Elgarat, who holds both Israeli and Danish citizenship, had called his brother from the safe room of his home on October 7th. Danny Elgarat told Hebrew-language media that Itzik was 'hysterical' and had been wounded in the arm by gunfire. The last thing he told his brother was 'this is the end.' Mantzur immigrated from Iraq to Israel as a teenager. He was married to his wife Mazel, who escaped the onslaught physically unharmed, for more than 60 years. The IDF recently said that Mantzur was murdered by terrorists on October 7th at his home in Kibbutz Kissufim, and that his body was abducted to the Gaza Strip. Mantzur's family had previously believed that he was kidnapped alive and had hoped for his safe return.

Freed hostage threatened Hamas captor who sexually abused her	Karina Ariev reportedly told outgoing IDF Chief of Staff that she was severely beaten, strangled during abduction to Gaza. By World Israel News Staff A female observation soldier who was kidnapped from her army base by Hamas terrorists and held in the Gaza Strip for 13 months revealed that she was sexually harassed by one of her captors, according to a Saturday evening report from Channel 12 News. Karina Ariev, 20, was abducted from Nahal Oz alongside Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, Liri Albag, and Naama Levy. Nearly all of the other soldiers on the base were killed in the Hamas onslaught. The five women were freed in late January and early February, during phase one of the ongoing ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. While Ariev has not yet spoken directly to the media, Channel 12 News reported new details about October 7th and her time in captivity. The report is based on a conversation that Ariev had with outgoing Chief of Staff Herzi HaLevi. One of the terrorists repeatedly sexually harassed Ariev, though details about his behavior were not included in the report. Ariev said she threatened to tell his commander about his actions, and the harassment stopped, according to Channel 12 News. The Jerusalem-born soldier said she had initially played dead during the Hamas invasion of the base, hiding amid a pile of dead bodies. Meanwhile, terrorists fired additional shots into dead soldiers' bodies, in order to confirm they had killed them. A terrorist noticed that Ariev was still alive and pulled her aside. If he hadn't seen her breathing, Ariev likely would have been shot multiple times. On the way to Gaza, Ariev was severely beaten and strangled nearly to the point of unconsciousness by her abductors. They also stole her jewelry and ripped hair out of her head. At one point Ariev was forced to lie on the hot hood of the terrorists' vehicle, which caused burns to her body. Once in captivity, Ariev endured psychological torture, including threats and insults from the terrorists guarding her.

‘Entering strongholds of terrorism,’ Netanyahu says in Tulkarem	Netanyahu on Thursday ordered the military to conduct a 'massive' counter-terrorism operation in Judea and Samaria following the failed bus bombings in Tel Aviv. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a visit to the Tulkarem refugee camp in Samaria on Friday—hours after explosions on several buses in the Tel Aviv area that are being investigated as a coordinated terror attack—that Israeli troops 'are doing a tremendous job.' 'In the past year, we have greatly increased our activity. We are entering the strongholds of terrorism, leveling entire streets used by terrorists and their homes, as well as eliminating terrorists and commanders,' Netanyahu said, per an English translation his office provided. 'We are taking extremely important measures against Hamas and other terrorist entities who are attempting to harm us.' The Israeli premier called the events of Thursday night 'an attempt to perpetrate a series of terrorist attacks with mass casualties' that 'is a very severe situation.' In response, he said, Israel is launching 'additional operations against hotbeds of terrorism.' 'I know that our heroic soldiers know how to do this job well,' Netanyahu said. Netanyahu on Thursday ordered the military to conduct a 'massive' counter-terrorism operation in Judea and Samaria and instructed the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and Israel Police to step up 'preventive activities' against possible additional attacks across the country. Following a situational assessment on Thursday, the IDF said its operations in Judea and Samaria were ongoing and announced the deployment of three additional battalions to reinforce security in the territories. All of the explosions on Thursday occurred in parked, empty buses across the central cities of Bat Yam and Holon, located south of Tel Aviv. There were no injuries in the attack. At least one of the bombs bore a note, in Arabic and Hebrew, that stated, 'Revenge from the Tulkarem refugee camp,' Channel 12 News reported. Five explosive devices, all with timers set to go off simultaneously, were found in what was intended to be a 'strategic terrorist attack,' Channel 12 cited security sources as saying. On Friday, Defense Minister Israel Katz toured the Tulkarem camp, where he vowed to vanquish the terrorists. 'We are at war with extremist Islamic terror and we will win—here, in Gaza and everywhere,' he said. The IDF said on Friday that troops detained some 90 terror suspects in Judea and Samaria over the past week. The military has been conducting an offensive in Samaria, dubbed 'Operation Iron Wall,' since January 21.

Trump: Israel’s decision on Gaza ‘rough,’ fine with war or truce	The president was also asked about his resettlement plan for Palestinians in Gaza in places like Egypt and Jordan, to which he replied that he is not going to force the issue. By JNS It is for Israel to decide whether to resume the war in Gaza or continue into the second round of talks with Hamas to free more hostages, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday. Asked by Brian Kilmeade on Fox News whether he was 'okay either way,' Trump answered, 'I am.' Hamas is 'so violent and vicious,' the president continued, 'it’s a decision that has to be made; it’s a rough decision. One group [of hostages] came in so bad, it looked like [they came out of] a concentration camp in Germany,' Trump said in reference to Eli Sharabi, Or Levy, and Ohad Ben Ami, the three Israeli men who were freed from Gazan captivity on Feb. 8 in emaciated and frail condition. Trump went on to say that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'actually not torn. I mean, you know where he stands, and he would like to go in, and he’s just so angry, and he should be. If he’s not angry, then there’d be something wrong with him, frankly. He is very angry; he’s a very angry man at what happened, especially what happened yesterday with these kids …, they were babies,' the president said, referring to the return of the bodies of children Ariel and Kfir Bibas who were kidnapped into Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. 'It looked like [the Gazans] were celebrating as they were bringing the bodies back. You know, to see it is not even believable. … when you see what’s happening … It’s so barbaric. You wouldn’t think that would happen in the modern age, but it happened,' Trump added. The president was also asked about his resettlement plan for Palestinians in Gaza in places like Egypt and Jordan, to which he replied that he is not going to force the issue. 'Well, we pay Jordan and Egypt billions of dollars a year and I was a little surprised they [rejected the proposal], but they did. And I’ll tell you, the way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works,' Trump said. 'But I’m not forcing it,' he added. 'I’m just gonna sit back and recommend it, and then the U.S. would own the site and there’d be no Hamas, and they’d be developed and then you’d start all over again with a clean plate,' the president said. Trump seemed to raise some doubt over his plan, saying that it 'depends on what happens over the next little while. … The question is, can you wipe [Hamas] all out, you know, they are so interspersed among people and it’s certainly not an easy thing to do. 'But I liked my plan; I thought my plan was good. You get them out, you move them, you build a beautiful community and a permanent community, and you then take the Gaza Strip,' Trump said. 'We’ll see what happens. It’s a great location. I don’t know why Israel ever gave that up [in the 2005 disengagement]. … It’s one of the bad real estate deals.' On Tuesday, Israel’s Channel 12 News reported that Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer will head negotiations for the second phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. Mossad chief David Barnea led previous rounds. The Israeli outlet reported earlier this month that Barnea would still engage with Qatari and Egyptian mediators under Dermer’s guidance. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told reporters on Tuesday that Jerusalem had decided to start talks on Phase 2 of the agreement. Terrorists in Gaza still holding 63 hostages, 36 of whom have been confirmed dead.

IDF: Hamas murdered Ariel and Kfir Bibas with their bare hands	Hamas then mutilated their bodies to support the claim that they were killed in an air strike and conceal the despicable crime. By Kostis Konstantinou, TPS Ariel and Kfir Bibas, the two toddlers abducted by Hamas terrorists on October 7 were not killed by an Israeli air strike. They were murdered in a brutal manner, according to a televised statement delivered by IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari today. Citing forensic evidence from the children’s remains combined with intelligence reports, Hagari said that the captors of Ariel and Kfir (aged 4 years and 10 months respectively at the time of their abduction) 'brutally murdered them with their bare hands'. He added that they then mutilated their bodies to support the claim that they were killed in an air strike and conceal the despicable crime, treating two helpless infants 'the way ISIS' has done in the past. Hagari added that the IDF has shared this intelligence with international partners. The IDF Spokesperson also disclosed that he spoke with the children’s father, the only surviving member of the Bibas family. 'Yarden wants the whole world to know the brutal manner in which his children were murdered,' he explained.

Israel redeems six hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza	Hamas is slated to return four additional bodies to Israel next Thursday, in what would be the final exchange of Phase 1 of the ceasefire agreement that took effect on Jan. 19 and is due to end on March 1. By Charles Bybelezer, JNS Israel on Saturday redeemed six living hostages from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip: Eliya Cohen, 27, Avera Mengistu, 39, Hisham al-Sayed, 36, Omer Shem Tov, 22, Tal Shoham, 40, and Omer Wenkert, 23. Cohen, Shem Tov, Shoham and Wenkert were all abducted during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, while Mengistu and al-Sayed suffer from mental illness and crossed into the Strip over a decade ago. Hamas released Mengistu and Shoham during a propaganda ceremony in southern Gaza’s Rafah, while Cohen, Shem Tov and Wenkert were freed in a similar exchange in Nuseirat in the Palestinian enclave’s center. Al-Sayed was handed over in Gaza City. Shoham’s family released a statement hailing the 'unforgettable moment,' while urging the government to do everything in its power to bring home the remaining captives. 'We thank all the people of Israel who stood with us through all the long days of pain and suffering. During these days, we need privacy for Tal, Adi, and the children,' said the statement. 'At this crucial moment in our lives, our only request is to seize this window of opportunity to secure a deal that will bring fathers back to their children—children need their fathers—and return all hostages home: the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for eternal rest.' Added Mengistu’s relatives: 'Our family has endured 10 years and five months of unimaginable suffering. During this time, there have been continuous efforts to secure his return, with prayers and pleas, some silent, that remained unanswered until today. … We ask that these moments be respected, and that we be granted the peace and rest we so desperately need.' The hostages were all handed over to Red Cross representatives and driven to meetings point in Gaza, where they were transferred to Israeli special forces. The captives were then taken back to Israel, where they underwent a preliminary physical and psychological examination at an army facility near Kibbutz Re’im, located close to the border, and to meet with their families. 'The commanders and soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces salute and embrace the returning hostages as they make their way home to the State of Israel,' said the military in a statement. Cohen’s family said in a statement on Saturday, 'We are overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude for Eliya’s return home after 505 long and torturous days in captivity. … 'We want to thank the IDF soldiers, the fighters, the Hostages Families Forum, our family liaison officer Amit, and especially all citizens of Israel for their embrace, support, and unwavering faith. Many prayers were answered today, and we thank everyone who accompanied us on this long journey,' added the statement. Shem Tov’s family noted he survived captivity despite suffering from celiac disease and has become 'a child of the entire State of Israel' since the Oct. 7 invasion and massacre. 'We still don’t know everything—the horror stories will only be revealed with time. But now, we can hug him again,' the family said in a statement. 'Thank you to the Creator, to the people of Israel for their prayers, strength and love. Thank you to the soldiers who sacrificed for this moment, to everyone involved in the negotiations and diplomatic efforts. Thank you to Omer’s family and friends, and ours, who never gave up and never lost hope,' it added. In exchange, Israel was set to release on Saturday 602 Palestinian terrorists, including 50 serving life sentences, 60 serving long terms and 47 re-arrested after the 2011 swap for captive IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. However, Israel informed Palestinian officials in Ramallah that the release would be postponed until 8 p.m. local time. 'Regarding the delay in the release of the terrorists—following the conclusion of [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s] security consultation, a decision will be made regarding next steps, and the completion of the return of hostages’ remains at this stage,' an unnamed Israeli source was quoted by Hebrew media as saying. Hamas is slated to return four additional bodies to Israel next Thursday, in what would be the final exchange of Phase 1 of the ceasefire agreement that took effect on Jan. 19 and is due to end on March 1. On Friday, Netanyahu eulogized the slain hostages returned the previous day—octogenarian Oded Lifshitz and children Kfir and Ariel Bibas—and vowed to bring home the boys’ mother, Shiri Bibas, from Gaza. 'The cruelty of the Hamas monsters knows no bounds. Not only did they kidnap the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two small babies. In an unspeakably cynical manner, they did not return Shiri to her little children, the little angels, and they put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin,' said Netanyahu in a video message to the nation. 'We will work resolutely to bring Shiri home together with all our abductees—both living and dead—and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement. The sacred memory of Oded Lipshitz and Ariel and Kfir Bibas will be forever enshrined in the heart of the nation. God will avenge their blood,' he continued. Overnight Friday, Hamas returned the body of Shiri Bibas, who was murdered in cold blood in captivity. Yarden Bibas was freed on Feb. 1 after 484 days in Hamas captivity. Terrorists in Gaza are still holding 63 hostages, 36 of whom have been confirmed dead. Below are short bios of the hostages freed on Saturday: • Eliya Cohen, 27, is a resident of Tzur Hadassah near Jerusalem and has three younger sisters. Known for his zest for life, love of travel, and fondness for people, he worked in marketing and real estate after a career as an event producer.

The book, With Strength and With Spirit, which was distributed in Bnei Akiva yeshivas and girls' high schools, was accidentally left behind by an IDF soldier. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Freed hostage and IDF lookout Agam Berger discovered a book by Rabbi Haim Druckman in Gaza and consulted it on whether one can eat non-kosher meat in life-threatening situations. The book, which was distributed in Bnei Akiva yeshivas and girls' high schools, was accidentally left behind by an IDF soldier. Berger, who maintained Jewish observance during her captivity, said that upon reading the book, she learned that she was permitted to eat non-kosher meat if her life was in danger. Elhanan Glatt, CEO of the Bnei Akiva Yeshivot and Ulpanot Center, said, 'Rabbi Druckman, your efforts are rewarded, and they have returned from enemy territory. We aimed to instill the spirit and light of Rabbi Druckman in the soldiers just before the ground operation began.' Yaniv Sufan, director of the 'Hinenu' initiative continuing Rabbi Druckman’s legacy, said, 'It is deeply moving that the booklets from Rabbi Druckman, of blessed memory, reached the soldiers who needed them most—the lookouts.' 'There is no better representation of the booklet's title, With Strength and With Spirit,'than Agam’s spirit of greatness, which has become evident since her return.' Liri Albag reported that Agam Berger stayed true to her religious observance during her captivity, including keeping kosher and observing Shabbat. 'Despite the difficult conditions and limited food options, Agam chose to remain faithful to her values and her faith,' Liri said. Liri’s mother, Merav, shared that her daughter refused to eat any non-kosher food offered to her during captivity, despite the severe food shortages. Before her daughter’s release, Merav Berger requested that if Agam were released on Saturday, those involved, as well as the media, avoid violating Shabbat. 'I will wait for Agam, with G-d’s help, when she comes, with as little desecration of Shabbat as possible,' she said. 'I ask of you, those who embrace us and have journeyed with us, and who have the great merit of bringing our children home—please do not desecrate Shabbat.' In addition to Berger, other released hostages reported refusing leavened food during Passover and fasting on Yom Kippur, despite suffering severe malnutrition.

US envoy warns Hamas to release all hostages ‘or face total annih...	Boehler: 'It’s not just that you need to release her (Shiri Bibas's) body; you must free all of the remaining hostages.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US envoy for hostages Adam Boehler had harsh words for Hamas after they returned an anonymous corpse to Israel instead of the body of Shiri Bibas. Boehler described Hamas’s action as 'a clear violation' and offered this piece of advice: 'It’s not just that you need to release her body; you must free all of the remaining hostages.' He pointed out that Hamas is still holding Idan Alexander, an Israeli-American, and stated, 'Idan needs to come home.' 'If I were them, I’d release everyone, or they will face total annihilation,' he added. On Thursday, Hamas held a ceremony for cheering crowds in Gaza, claiming the bodies in the coffins belonged to hostages Kfir Bibas, Ariel Bibas, Shiri Bibas, and Oded Lifshitz. However, upon examination by a forensics team, it was revealed that the body they said was Shiri Bibas’s was actually that of an anonymous woman, not a hostage. Additionally, Hamas falsely claimed that the Bibas family members were killed by Israeli airstrikes. Forensic experts determined that the Bibas children had been murdered. Yarden Bibas, their father, was released from Hamas captivity last week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences in a Hebrew-language video statement: 'The State of Israel bows its head over the loss of two small children, tender infants, brothers—Ariel and Kfir Bibas, may their memory be a blessing—and over Oded Lifshitz, may his memory be a blessing, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz.' 'All three were brutally murdered in Hamas captivity during the first weeks of the war. The cruelty of Hamas knows no bounds.' Netanyahu continued, 'Not only did they abduct the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two little babies, but in an act of unimaginable cynicism, they did not return Shiri to her small children. Instead, they placed the body of a Gazan woman in the coffin.' He pledged that Hamas would pay 'the full price' for violating the ceasefire and hostage deal with Israel. 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home, along with all our captives—both the living and the fallen—and we will ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and vicious breach of the agreement.'

Israel accuses Turkey of helping Iran funnel funds to Hezbollah	Israel’s Channel 14 reported on Tuesday that it is believed that tens of millions of dollars have already reached Hezbollah through Turkey. By JNS Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on Monday accused Turkey of assisting Iran in funneling funds to Hezbollah in Lebanon. During a meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem with a bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators, which included seven senators and Deputy Middle East Special Envoy Morgan Ortagus, Sa’ar warned that Iran has intensified its efforts to finance Hezbollah, with the active involvement of Turkey. 'There is an increased Iranian effort to smuggle money to Lebanon for Hezbollah in order to restore its power and status, including via Turkey and through its cooperation,' said Sa’ar.

A senior political source told Channel 14 reporter Tamir Morag: 'Turkey sees itself as the leader of the Sunni world, and as such, it plays a ‘big players’ game against Shi’ite Iran.

RFK Jr. orders sweeping review of vaccines and antidepressants	Kennedy listed several other things as possible causes of chronic diseases such as radiation from electronic devices, farming chemicals, processed foods, food allergies, tiny plastic particles in the environment, and chemicals used to make non-stick pans. By Jewish Breaking News A month ago, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sat before a Senate hearing committee and declared, 'I support vaccines. I support the vaccine schedule. I support good science.' But this week, Kennedy struck a markedly different tone. His first act as Health Secretary was to announce an investigation whether childhood vaccinations might be linked to chronic diseases. 'We will convene representatives of all viewpoints to study the causes for the drastic rise in chronic disease,' Kennedy told the assembled workers at HHS headquarters on Tuesday. 'Some of the possible factors we will investigate were formerly taboo or insufficiently scrutinized.' Kennedy made it clear he planned to redirect the agency’s vast resources toward questioning long-established medical consensus, noting that 'nothing is going to be off limits.' His investigation plans go beyond just vaccines and antidepressants. Kennedy listed several other things as possible causes of chronic diseases such as radiation from electronic devices, farming chemicals, processed foods, food allergies, tiny plastic particles in the environment, and chemicals used to make non-stick pans. 'Whatever belief or suspicion I have expressed in the past, I’m willing to subject them all to the scrutiny of unbiased science,' he said. 'That is going to be our template — unbiased science. That’s something that will make us all proud of this agency and of our role in restoring American health.' However, public health experts warn there’s a big difference between studying new environmental threats and re-examining vaccines that we already know are safe. 'It’s very disturbing that someone who has spent so much of his career trying to undermine confidence in vaccines, trying to tear down the infrastructure that approves and recommends vaccines, has the potential to be in a position of power over the infrastructure that has those goals,' infectious disease specialist Adam Ratner tells NPR. 'It is much easier to scare people than to unscare them,' he says. 'And I think that just by elevating anti-vaccine views in the guise of RFK, I think that we risk a crisis in vaccine confidence in the U.S.' The post RFK Jr. orders sweeping review of vaccines and antidepressants appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/rfk-jr-orders-sweeping-review-of-vaccines-and-antidepressants/	2025-02-21T02:59:24-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25028838083237.jpg
IAF strikes Hezbollah smuggling routes on Lebanon-Syria border	Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday vowed to continue to act against Hezbollah 'at full strength.' By JNS The Israeli Air Force overnight Thursday attacked crossing points in the area of the Lebanon-Syria border used by Hezbollah to smuggle weapons into the Land of the Cedars. The military noted that the Iranian-backed terrorist group’s attempt to rearm constitutes a blatant violation of ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. 'The IDF continues to operate to remove any threat to the State of Israel and will operate to prevent any attempt by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to rebuild its forces,' the military said.

The incident came a day after the deadline for a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory, under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Jerusalem and Beirut that went into effect on Nov. 27. On Monday, the IDF confirmed that troops would remain deployed at five strategic outposts in Southern Lebanon because the Lebanese Armed Forces have not fully deployed in the area in place of Hezbollah, as required by the terms of the truce. Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday vowed to continue to act against Hezbollah 'at full strength.'

‘Hamas will pay the full price’ for murdering Bibas family, withh...	After forensic examinations reveal that the two youngest hostages abducted on October 7th were murdered in captivity, and that Hamas violated deal by withholding mother's remains, Netanyahu vows terror group 'will pay the full price.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu castigated Hamas Friday morning, and warned that Israel would 'seek justice' against the terror organization, after Israeli forensics examiners found that two small children taken hostage were murdered. 'The State of Israel bows its head over the loss of two small children, tender infants, brothers—Ariel and Kfir Bibas, may their memory be a blessing, and over Oded Lifshitz, may his memory be a blessing, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz,' Netanyahu said in a Hebrew-language video statement. 'All three were brutally murdered in Hamas captivity during the first weeks of the war. The cruelty of the Hamas monsters knows no bounds.' Netanyahu ripped Hamas not only for the murders of the Bibas children - both of whom were, according to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute, murdered in November 2023 - but also for using their bodies in a propaganda display in Gaza on Thursday. The premier also lambasted the terror group for refusing to return the body of the boys' mother, Shiri Bibas. Hamas claimed it handed over Shiri's remains on Thursday, but examiners at Abu Kabir determined that the body was not that of Mrs. Bibas. 'Not only did they abduct the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two little babies, but in an act of unimaginable cynicism, they did not return Shiri to her small children, these little angels, and instead placed the body of a Gazan woman in the coffin.' Netanyahu pledged that Hamas would pay 'the full price' for violating the ceasefire and hostage deal with Israel. 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home, along with all our captives—both the living and the fallen—and we will ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and vicious breach of the agreement.' 'May the sacred memory of Oded Lifshitz, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas be forever enshrined in the heart of the nation. May God avenge their blood. And we, too, will seek justice.' Shiri's husband, Yarden, the father of Kfir and Ariel, was released on February 1st, as part of the ceasefire deal. Israel contends that the substitution of another body for the remains of Shiri Bibas constitutes a violation of the hostage deal. On Friday, Hamas issued a statement admitting that it had not returned Mrs. Bibas' remains. The terror group claimed that Shiri Bibas was killed in an IDF airstrike - despite forensic evidence from the Bibas children that they were not killed as a result of an airstrike. 'Shiri Bibas' remains apparently became mixed with the remains of other dead under the rubble, after the IAF struck the place where she was staying,' Hamas claimed.

Beirut shuts down for Hezbollah leader’s funeral	Safieddine, who was designated to succeed Nasrallah before being eliminated by Israel, will be buried separately on Monday in his southern hometown of Deir Qanun al-Nahr. By Jewish Breaking News Hezbollah is pulling out all the stops for Sunday’s funeral of its eliminated leader Hassan Nasrallah and his deputy Hashem Safieddine, implementing extraordinary security measures and shutting down much of Beirut for the ceremony. According to AFP, Beirut’s airport will completely shut down from noon until 4:00 PM, with all flights suspended during the ceremony scheduled for 1:00 PM local time at Camille Chamoun sports stadium. After Israel bombed his underground bunker in September, Nasrallah was temporarily buried in an undisclosed location out of fear that Israel might target a large funeral gathering. Now, with an extended ceasefire in place, Hezbollah will be welcoming terrorists from around the world. Iran has promised 'high-level' participation but has notably avoided specifying which officials will attend. Iraqi Airways and Lebanon’s Middle East Airlines have increased flights from Baghdad as representatives of Iraq’s main pro-Iran terrorist factions also prepare to attend. The procession will then move from the stadium to Nasrallah’s burial site near the airport, now lined with Hezbollah flags and images of fallen terror commanders. Safieddine, who was designated to succeed Nasrallah before being eliminated by Israel, will be buried separately on Monday in his southern hometown of Deir Qanun al-Nahr. Hezbollah’s elaborate funeral comes as the Iranian-backed terror group grapples with mounting losses, including hundreds of fighters and senior commanders killed since it joined Hamas’s war against Israel in October 2023. Perhaps their worst day came on September 17 and 18 when 1,500 terrorists were taken out of commission when the Mossad detonated an unspecified number of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies. document.createElement('video'); The post Beirut shuts down for Hezbollah leader’s funeral appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/beirut-shuts-down-for-hezbollah-leaders-funeral/	2025-02-21T01:32:52-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/shutterstock_2342698091-scaled.jpg
Netanyahu orders ‘massive’ counter-terror op after bus bombings	All of the explosions on Thursday occurred in parked, empty buses across the central city of Bat Yam, located just south of Tel Aviv. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday night ordered the military to conduct a 'massive' counter-terrorism operation in Judea and Samaria, after three buses exploded near Tel Aviv and bombs were found on two others in what is being investigated as a coordinated attack. Netanyahu also instructed the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and Israel Police to step up 'preventive activities' against possible additional attacks across the country. Following a situational assessment on Thursday, the IDF said its operations in Judea and Samaria were ongoing, and that areas within the territories have been closed off. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi instructed forces to assist the Israel Police as necessary. The military also announced the deployment of three additional battalions to reinforce security in Judea and Samaria, adding that it was 'prepared to expand the offensive operations.' An investigator examines a bombed bus in Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv, Feb. 20, 2025. Credit: Flash90. All of the explosions on Thursday occurred in parked, empty buses across the central city of Bat Yam, located just south of Tel Aviv. There were no injuries in the attack. At least one of the bombs bore a note, in Arabic and Hebrew, that stated, 'Revenge from the Tulkarem refugee camp,' a reference to the terrorist hotbed in Samaria where security forces have been conducting operations, Channel 12 News reported. Five explosive devices, all with timers set to go off simultaneously, were found in what was intended to be a 'strategic terrorist attack,' Channel 12 cited security sources as saying. The Shin Bet was called to the scenes, and all bus drivers in the Tel Aviv metropolitan were instructed to search their vehicles for bombs. Miri Regev, the Israeli transport minister, instructed the National Public Transport Authority to 'stop and inspect all buses, trains and light rail cars and act in accordance with the instructions of the Shin Bet and the police.' Defense Minister Israel Katz directed the IDF to increase 'the intensity of activities to thwart terrorism in the Tulkarm refugee camp and in the refugee camps in Judea and Samaria in general,' following what he called 'attempted serious terrorist attacks. 'We will pursue the terrorists to the bitter end and destroy the terrorist infrastructure in the camps that serve as a frontline for the Iranian axis of evil,' Katz said.

American conservatives vote to back Israeli sovereignty over Jude...	‘Akin to the Balfour Declaration’ - Conservative Political Action Conference, America’s largest annual gathering of political conservatives, votes to endorse Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff American conservative activists voted this week to endorse the application of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, amid speculation the Netanyahu government may move forward with a long-shelved plan to place Israeli towns in the disputed area under Israeli law. On Wednesday night, the American Conservative Union kicked off its annual gathering, the Conservative Political Action Conference, in Oxon Hill, Maryland, outside of Washington D.C. According to multiple reports in the Israeli media Thursday night, during the conference, activists voted to back a resolution calling for the extension of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. The resolution was drafted following talks between senior CPAC officials and settlement enterprise leaders, including Israel Ganz, mayor of the Binyamin Regional Council and chairman of the Yesha Council, the umbrella group representing Israeli municipalities in Judea and Samaria, Israel National News reported. The Yesha Council was represented at the conference by the organization’s CEO, Omer Rahamim. The 'CPAC resolution,' Rahamim told The Jerusalem Post, 'carries considerable weight with respect to American support for the extension of Israeli sovereignty to Judea and Samaria.' The Israeli government also sent an envoy to the conference, with Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli (Likud) attending. On Thursday, former Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland read the text of the CPAC resolution. 'We believe all these areas are integral parts of Israel, and the United States of America and her allies should recognize Israeli sovereignty over these lands,' the resolution states regarding Judea and Samaria. In response, Ganz hailed the resolution as a second 'Balfour Declaration,' referring to the 1917 letter by British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, later adopted by the British government as its official policy, backing the formation of a Jewish national homeland in the historic Land of Israel. 'Your declaration is akin to the Balfour Declaration,' Ganz said. 'You are granting political validity to biblical values and to justice. This is a tremendous blessing for Israel, the U.S, and the entire free world.' 'The extension of sovereignty will launch a new era based on the historic truth that the Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people and the Jewish state. These days are proof of the depth of the partnership between our countries, both in the processes currently underway, and in the promise for Israel’s hold on Judea and Samaria. The declaration today clarifies the importance of changing the security reality in all the arenas – the north, the south and in Judea and Samaria, to ensure the security of the State of Israel.'

Shiri Bibas still held in Gaza, Bibas children murdered in captiv...	In a chilling display, Hamas paraded the children's bodies in coffins before handing them over to the Red Cross for transfer to Israel. By Joseph Lichtenstadter, World Israel News The IDF has confirmed that the body returned by Hamas is not that of Shiri Bibas, deepening the anguish surrounding the fate of her family. Reports initially suggested that the hostages being transferred were Kfir and Ariel Bibas—the baby and toddler sons of Shiri Bibas—along with a 84-year-old grandfather, Oded Lifshitz. While the IDF has verified the identities of the two children and the elderly Oded, the fourth body remains unidentified. Tragically, the IDF has also confirmed that Hamas terrorists murdered the Bibas brothers after abducting them from their cribs in Nir Oz during the October 7th massacre. In a chilling display, Hamas paraded the children's bodies in coffins before handing them over to the Red Cross for transfer to Israel. The grim stage was adorned with a poster featuring images of the hostages, alongside a grotesque depiction of Prime Minister Netanyahu as a vampire. The coffins were even marked with a 'date of arrest,' as if to erase the innocence of the victims—a young mother, her defenseless children, and an elderly man. As Israel reels from this devastating development, the uncertainty surrounding Shiri Bibas’s fate casts an even darker shadow over the already unbearable grief. The IDF is still assessing the situation, and further updates are expected.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Iris Haim, mother of Yotam Haim, who was mistakenly shot by the IDF after fleeing his captors, compared the deceased Bibas children to her son. 'The red-haired children are similar to Yotam. He was a red-haired child, exactly like them, on Kibbutz Gvulot,' she said in an interview with Channel 14. 'Orange is the color of love, the orange-gold hair of the three hostages – Ariel and Kfir Bibas and Yotam Haim,' she wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday. Kfir and Ariel Bibas, the red-haired children who, along with their mother Shiri, became symbolic of the hostage crisis, were returned in coffins to Israel along with the body of deceased hostage Oded Lifshitz. When Hamas released the names of the four dead hostages, relatives of the Bibas family said they had been holding out hope until the names were confirmed and criticized the press for prematurely eulogizing the Bibas family before Israel had confirmed they had been killed. Haim said, 'Yesterday, the names were published despite the family’s request not to do so. Until yesterday, I had hoped for the Bibas family.' Speaking as a mother who lost a son hostage in Gaza, Haim said, 'You don’t realize it until you see the body, and then you understand. Because I understand the family so well, I would ask that, until the last moment, no one speak about it.' 'This is a major tragedy for the country. People were devastated because they understood that these situations are becoming more complicated&#8230; Now hostages may return, alive or dead.' Haim said the tragedy provides a kind of clarity about 'how much we care for, love, and support each other.'

By World Israel News and JNS Israeli security agencies are investigating three explosions that occurred in parked buses across the central Israeli city of Bat Yam on Thursday night as suspected terrorist attacks. According to reports, the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) was called to the scenes, and bus drivers in the Tel Aviv area have been instructed to search their vehicles for possible explosives. In addition, operations of the Tel Aviv light rail has been grounded, Channel 12 News reported. Israel Police said that multiple explosive devices weighing approximately 5 kilograms each were placed into buses, intending to explode Friday morning, possibly killing hundreds of civilians. There were no injuries as a result of the blasts, the Israel Police stated. Bat Yam Mayor Zvika Brot told local media, 'The incident began at two locations just minutes apart. Two bombs were detonated on two buses that were empty.' He added that while there were no casualties in the suspected terror attacks, 'there are suspicions of an additional bomb.' Shortly after Brot issued his statement, Israeli media outlets aired video footage of what was said to be a third bus explosion in the Bat Yam area.

UN finally condemns Hamas, says ceremony over hostage bodies migh...	Under international law, any handover of the remains of the deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk criticized Hamas for the ceremony it held during the release of the bodies of four hostages. 'Under international law, any handover of the remains of the deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families,' the rights chief said in a statement. The captives included 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, 33-year-old Shiri Bibas, and her two sons – the youngest Israelis taken hostage by Gazan terrorists on October 7th – Ariel and Kfir. At an event held by Hamas in the Bani Suheila neighborhood of the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis on Thursday morning, a large crowd cheered as Hamas arrived carrying four black coffins in separate cars. 'As the bodies of four Israeli hostages are transferred by Hamas to the Red Cross, hundreds of ‘innocent Gazans’ dance to music and happily film this tragic event,' Israel’s Government Press Office wrote on X. 'We are at a loss for words to describe how this makes us feel.' Half an hour later, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office announced that the coffins carrying the four slain hostages had been handed over to the IDF. 'Israel has received, through the Red Cross, the coffins of four fallen hostages,' the PMO stated. During the transfer of the bodies, a heated exchange took place between Red Cross officials and Hamas terrorists over the ceremony and the manner in which the transfer was handled. Israel also protested to the mediators and filed a complaint with the Red Cross about the 'ceremony.' 'The pain is indescribable. Our hearts, those of the entire nation, are shattered,' President Isaac Herzog said. 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I lower my head and seek forgiveness. Forgiveness for failing to protect you on that tragic day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely. May their memory be a blessing.'

Hamas official says at least 2.3 million people alive in Gaza, un...	Furthermore, Naim denied that the ongoing war is between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group, asserting that the entirety of the Palestinian people is fighting against Israel. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner During an interview with anti-Israel social media personality Jackson Hinkle, a Hamas leader claimed that over 2 million people are still alive in the Gaza Strip, undercutting the notion that a so-called 'genocide' has taken place in the war-torn enclave. Citing recent comments made by US President Donald Trump that roughly 1.7 million people remain in Gaza, Hinkle asked interview guest Basem Naim, a Hamas official and former Gaza Minister of Health, whether he believed that far more people had died in the enclave than originally thought. Naim immediately dismissed the claim, clarifying that over 2 million Palestinians in Gaza are still alive. 'Donald Trump has come out a few times and he says the population in Gaza is 1.7 to 1.8 million. Of course, before [Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel] the population was much more than that, 400,000 to 500,000. Do you think his statistics are accurate, and if so, where did all those people go? Because we see the Ministry of Health in Gaza, they say the [Palestinian] death toll registered officially is over 40,000 [during the Israel-Hamas war],' Hinkle asked. 'I have no idea about his intentions to mention this number. But officially, there are 2.3 million-plus Palestinians are in the Gaza Strip,' Naim said. The senior Hamas official added that around 200,000 Palestinians have fled the Gaza Strip to other areas for safety reasons both before and after the current war. He claimed that many Palestinians left for academic or professional reasons. The terrorist official said that he believes around 50,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel’s defensive military operations following the Oct. 7 attack and that around 10,000 are missing. Furthermore, Naim denied that the ongoing war is between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group, asserting that the entirety of the Palestinian people is fighting against Israel. 'First of all, this confrontation is not between Hamas and Israel, because this has been said all the time in Western media. It is between Palestinians and Israel. Maybe this time, it is led by Hamas,' he said. Naim stated that Hamas’s 'armed resistance' is a tool the group uses to achieve its 'political goals' of destroying Israel and creating a Palestinian state in its place. He added that the Oct. 7 attacks — in which roughly 1200 people were killed in southern Israel and 250 were abducted as hostages — were a justified response to Israeli aggression. He denied that the brutal and unprovoked slaughter of Israeli civilians was 'initiated from our side.' Hinkle has an extensive history of spreading unsubstantiated and false claims about Israel. Like many anti-Israel critics, he has repeatedly asserted that the Jewish state has committed a 'genocide' in Gaza as revenge for Oct. 7. However, Hinkle has gone further than other anti-Israel commentators, oftentimes lauding the Hamas terrorist group as a 'resistance' organization and celebrating Iran’s April 2024 missile attacks against the Jewish state. Hinkle has referred to the anti-Israel outrage following Oct. 7 as a personal 'godsend,' which allowed his X/Twitter follower count balloon from roughly 400,000 to over 2.3 million in the span of a few months. 'DROP A LIKE if you stand with IRAN in the face of ISRAELI TERRORISM!' Hinkle posted on X/Twitter in April 2024. Beyond his support for Hamas, Hinkle has praised the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has defended the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Israel bans entry for those denying October 7 massacre or working...	If enacted, the law would criminalize collaboration with the ICC, making it illegal for Israeli citizens, authorities, and public entities to provide services or resources to the court. By Pesach Benson, TPS As Israelis prepared to receive the bodies of four hostages, the Israeli Knesset on Wednesday passed legislation barring non-citizens from entering or residing in the country if they or their affiliated organizations deny the October 7 massacre or the Holocaust, or if they support international prosecution of Israeli security personnel. The legislation, which was approved without opposition, builds on a 2017 amendment that barred providing visas and travel permits to individuals or organizations advocating boycotts of Israel. Proposed by Michel Buskila of the New Hope-United Right party and originally initiated by New Hope MK Zeev Elkin, the law aims to strengthen Israel’s ability to counteract what it described as 'hostile elements' who 'seek to harm the state.' According to the bill’s explanatory notes, existing legal measures were insufficient. The Knesset also advanced another bill targeting cooperation with the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. That proposal, submitted by Likud MK Amit Halevi, passed its preliminary reading with 25 votes in favor and 10 against. If enacted, the law would criminalize collaboration with the ICC, making it illegal for Israeli citizens, authorities, and public entities to provide services or resources to the court. Individuals found guilty of doing so could face up to five years in prison. The bill also seeks to prevent ICC officials and affiliates from entering Israel, owning property, or conducting economic activities in the country without special authorization. Supporters argue that the ICC poses a significant threat to Israel’s sovereignty and security personnel, reinforcing Israel’s longstanding position that it does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction. The International Criminal Court issued unprecedented arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in November, the first time warrants have been issued against leaders from a democratic country. Both officials would be liable for arrest if they travel to countries that are party to the ICC. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Deif. Although he was killed in an airstrike in July, Hamas never confirmed Deif’s death. Israel is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction. The ICC charter prohibits the court from prosecuting nationals of countries with independent judiciaries. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 69 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

Israel to free 602 terrorists as part of ceasefire	Of the 602 terrorists to be released this week, 108 are expected to be deported to Egypt before being moved to other countries from there. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israel is set to commute the sentences of 602 imprisoned terrorists this week as part of the last two releases of the first phase of its ceasefire agreement with Hamas, Hebrew media reported on Thursday. In accordance with the deal, the bodies of four hostages were returned to the Jewish state on Thursday morning. The remains are said to be those of Shiri Bibas (32 when captured on Oct. 7, 2023) and her sons, Ariel (4 when taken) and Kfir (9 months old when taken), as well as of Oded Lifshitz (83 when taken). Six living hostages are scheduled to be released on Saturday. Of the prisoners to be released by Israel this week, 445—residents of the Gaza Strip who were arrested by Israeli forces after the Oct. 7 massacre—are set to be freed later on Thursday. The remaining 157 terrorists are to be released after the six hostages return to Israeli territory on Saturday. This figure includes 50 terrorists who were serving life sentences, 60 with long sentences and 47 who were released in a 2011 deal with Hamas and later rearrested. Of the 602 terrorists to be released this week, 108 are expected to be deported to Egypt before being moved to other countries from there. Among those scheduled for release is Khalil Jabarin, who murdered dual U.S.-Israeli citizen Ari Fuld at Judea’s Gush Etzion Junction in 2018. Another is Omar al-Zaban, a senior operative in Hamas’s 'military wing' serving 27 life sentences plus 25 years for his role in attacks that claimed the lives of at least 27 people. Bilal Abu-Ghanem is serving three life sentences for the 2015 murder of Haviv Haim, 78, Alon Govberg, 51, and Richard Lakin, 76, on bus 78 in Jerusalem’s Armon Hanatziv area. Also to be released is Nael Barghouti, convicted of murdering of Israeli bus driver Mordechai Yekuelin, 27, in January 1978. He was released in the 2011 Shalit deal but rearrested after once again engaging in terrorist activity. Abed el-Nasser Isa—widely considered to be a student of infamous Hamas bomb-maker Yahya Ayyash—is also to be released. In the current first phase of the truce, Hamas has agreed to free 33 hostages, while Israel agreed to commute the sentences of some 2,000 terrorists.

Qatar pretends to be a mediator, the ‘honest broker’ of the Middle East,' Rabbi Pini Dunner, spiritual leader of the Beverly Hills Synagogue stated. By JNS Dozens of Jewish-American activists gathered outside the Los Angeles estate of former Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani on Sunday in protest against Doha’s support for Hamas. The demonstration was led by Rabbi Pini Dunner, spiritual leader of the Beverly Hills Synagogue. Protestors—carrying signs reading, 'A Terrorist Financier Lives Here' and 'HBJ – Go Back to Qatar'—chanted for the return of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre. 'Bin Jassim brought Hamas to Doha and funded them with $30 million monthly in Gaza,' Dunner declared during the rally. 'He is personally responsible for the Oct. 7th massacre. How is it possible that after all this, he lives in a luxurious mansion in Bel Air, Los Angeles?' 'Qatar pretends to be a mediator, the ‘honest broker’ of the Middle East,' the rabbi noted. 'But you know what they really are? They are financiers and supporters of terrorism. All they care about is sowing destruction and chaos in the world and then pretending to solve it.' Hamad bin Jassim (HBJ) of Qatar funneled billions into Hamas, fueling terror and the carnage of Oct. 7th. Yet, he lounges in luxury at 11201 Chalon Rd, Bel Air—a $118M mansion funded by blood money. Why is a terror financier living freely in LA? REVOKE his visa. SEIZE his assets. pic.twitter.com/rMZX0WCuUx &mdash; Pini Dunner (@pinidunner) February 17, 2025 Sunday’s rally was a direct continuation of a demonstration held by the Jewish community some two weeks ago outside the Maybourne Beverly Hills hotel, part of a chain owned by the Qataris, he said. Qatar—which has hosted Hamas and has provided the terror group with hundreds of millions of dollars—has helped mediate the freedom of some Israeli hostages in return for a truce and the release of jailed Palestinian terrorists. Doha has previously deflected accusations of playing a double game, saying the United States requested that it open the mediation channel. Israel’s governing coalition is advancing a bill to prohibit terror-funding states from playing a role in diplomatic affairs between Israel and other countries or foreign entities, which would remove Qatar as a mediator.

Recently freed terrorist Mohammed Abu Warda seen at Hamas ‘ceremo...	The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Mohammed Abu Warda, a Palestinian terrorist freed on Jan. 30 and who was supposed to be deported to a third country, has been seen at Hamas’ handover ceremony in Khan Yunis wearing a green keffiyeh associated with the terror group. Warda was serving 48 life sentences for attacks on Israeli busses that killed 44 people in the 1990s. Among the hundreds of Palestinian terrorists released by Israel under the terms of the ceasefire are 19 who were to be deported abroad via Egypt after being taken to the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza. That crossing is adjacent to the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Israel’s Kan News reported that Egypt is refusing to let them enter. Hamas says it is handing over the bodies of Shiri Bibas, her sons, Ariel and Kfir, and Oded Lifshitz today. Deferring to the families, Israel is not confirming the names until the bodies are positively identified. The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how many Israeli captives are alive. Hamas notified Israeli authorities in January that of the 33, eight are dead, but offered no evidence. Since the first hostage release on Jan. 19, Hamas has freed 19 Israeli and five Thai captives in exchange for 952 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists. Hostages Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham Al-Sayed are due to return home alive on Saturday. The fate of the remaining 65 hostages will be determined by negotiations during the ceasefire’s second phase. Critics say the phased approach condemns these 65 hostages to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 73 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed to be dead.

By Jewish Breaking News Ten-month-old Kfir Bibas, his four-year-old brother Ariel, and their mother Shiri never made it home to Israel alive after their abduction by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023. Instead, their story ended in three coffins being transported out of Gaza today, prompting their second homeland to prepare for a day of national mourning. 'I am informed by the government that they will wait for official information on the DNA results of the bodies and that, if confirmed, Argentina will then declare a National Day of Mourning in their honour,' President of the Argentinian Commission for Human Rights Sabrina Ajmeche wrote on X. 'Two Argentinian babies assassinated because of Hamas terrorism. I hope that never again, after this, I have to hear that what happens in Israel and Gaza is not our concern, of all Argentines.' Ajmeche also shared a video of the children with their mother, moments frozen in time when joy still seemed possible. 'They are ours, we love them always,' she wrote.

As officials now await DNA confirmation at Tel Aviv’s Abu Kabir forensic institute, Argentina’s ambassador to Israel, Axel Wahnish, voiced the nation’s collective anguish. 'Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas: EVERYONE IS THINKING ABOUT YOU. We are going through one of the most sensitive and tragic moments since that fateful Oct. 7. We accompany and support family members.' Along with the three Bibas family members, Hamas also released the body of 83-year-old hostage Oded Lifshitz. As the convoy bringing them back passed through Israel’s streets on Thursday, hundreds stood in solemn silence to pay tribute to the murdered hostages. The families will be informed after identification and have requested the public to await official confirmation, according to a statement by the Israeli police.

The Atlantic Council, a prominent U.S. think tank, stated that the U.S. should follow Israel's lead in fostering ties with Azerbaijan. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following a meeting this week between Hikmet Hajiyev, Assistant to the President of Azerbaijan, and Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, officials described the 'game-changing' partnership between the Muslim nation, Israel, and the United States. 'Mr. Hajiyev conveyed the greetings of President Ilham Aliyev to Prime Minister Netanyahu,' the Azerbaijani Embassy in Israel stated. Hajiyev and Netanyahu discussed expanding bilateral cooperation, and diplomatic sources raised the possibility of including Azerbaijan in the Abraham Accords framework, alongside Israel and the U.S. The meeting between Netanyahu and Hajiyev took place just 48 hours after the Israeli Prime Minister met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Atlantic Council, a prominent U.S. think tank, stated that the U.S. should follow Israel's lead in fostering ties with Azerbaijan. The Atlantic Council said, 'Washington should learn from Israel’s diplomatic and security collaboration with Azerbaijan to bolster its own ties with Baku. Besides being a bulwark against Iran, close relations with Azerbaijan could help the United States gain a stronger foothold among Central Asian countries, with whom Azerbaijan has been developing stronger relations.' It continued, 'This would be especially important for the United States, as Central Asia is rich in minerals and energy and is home to the Middle Corridor, a trade route from Asia to Europe that bypasses both Russia and Iran.' In addition, the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies published a special Prospective Paper titled 'How to Effectively Engage Azerbaijan in Trump’s Regional Plans and in Israel’s Interests: Practical Recommendations.' The paper emphasized that the U.S. should aim for the inclusion of Azerbaijan in American-Israeli projects, including investment and technological development. Israelis are currently developing a partnership with Morocco as part of its projects with America and seeks to apply this model to other Sunni Gulf monarchies. These partnerships span defense, AI, and cybersecurity, aligning with the Trump Administration's vision of expanding multilateral alliances in the Middle East.

Investigators confirm identity of slain hostage Oded Lifshitz	After 503 days in captivity, the remains of Oded Lifshitz have been positively identified, hours after they were returned to Israel from Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Israeli forensics examiners at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute have positively identified the remains of one of the four bodies returned by Hamas on Thursday, confirming that the body of Oded Lifshitz was among those transferred to Israel. Lifshitz, a former journalist, was returned to Israel via the International Red Cross Thursday morning, along with the remains of Shiri Bibas and her sons, Ariel and Kfir - the two youngest hostages taken during the October 7th invasion. The four had been held in captivity in the Gaza Strip for 503 days. In a statement issued via the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Lifshitz's family expressed their 'deep sorrow' after Oded's identity was verified. 'We have received with deep sorrow the official and bitter news of the identification of our beloved Oded’s body. 503 agonizing days of uncertainty have come to an end. We so hoped and prayed that our ending would be different.' 'Now, we can mourn the husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather who has been missing from our lives since October 7th. Our family's healing will begin now and will not be complete until the last hostage is returned.' Lifshitz, who was 83 in October 2023, was abducted, along with his wife Yocheved, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th, 2023, before their home was torched by Hamas terrorists. The couple have been described as peace activists who volunteered to drive Gazans from the border into Israel for medical treatment. Yocheved was freed in October 2023, several weeks after being taken hostage.

Knesset votes to bar October 7th deniers from entering Israel	Under new law passed by the Knesset, Holocaust deniers, deniers of the Hamas massacres on October 7th, 2023, and anyone who supports the prosecution of Israeli soldiers will be barred from entering Israel. By World Israel News Staff The Knesset voted Wednesday night to bar Holocaust deniers and individuals who deny the Hamas massacres of Israelis on October 7th, 2023, from entering Israel. The bill, which was drafted by Coalition MK Mishel Buskila (New Hope), passed its final reading in the Knesset by a unanimous vote, 12 to 0. Based on existing legislation, the 2017 Amendment No. 28 to the Entry Into Israel Law which permits Israel to bar entry to non-citizens who have publicly endorsed the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, the new law enables the Interior Ministry to bar any non-citizen who denies the Holocaust or the October 7th massacres from entering Israel. Furthermore, the new law provides for barring entry to anyone who advocates for or publicly supports criminal prosecution abroad against Israeli soldiers or former service members. In addition, members or employees of organizations which back the prosecution of IDF soldiers abroad will also be barred from entering the country. 'The State of Israel, like any other country in the world, must defend itself, its citizens, soldiers, and national identity,' Buskila stated Wednesday ahead of the vote. 'Many countries in the world prohibit the entry of hostile entities who harm their security forces. Israel is a democratic country, but it is not naive. Those who support Israel will be respectfully welcomed. Those who attempt​ to undermine our very existence, deny the horrors of the past, or harm our soldiers and citizens, have no place among us.'

Nation mourns Bibas family, Oded Lifshitz as bodies transferred t...	Following the transfer from the Red Cross to IDF soldiers, a military memorial ceremony took place inside Gaza, featuring the Israeli flag, a salute ceremony, and a rabbi reciting from the Book of Psalms. By JNS Israel redeemed on Thursday the bodies of four slain hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza: the three members of the Bibas family—mother Shiri, infant son Kfir and his older brother Ariel, and octogenarian Oded Lifshitz. The Red Cross handed four coffins to Israel Defense Forces troops and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) agents in the Gaza Strip, after the Geneva-based agency received the caskets from the Hamas terrorist group following a propaganda ceremony. Israel filed a complaint with mediators and the Red Cross after the Hamas stage show, saying that it breached the terms of their agreement. IDF sappers inspected the caskets, which were locked without keys, to ensure they were not booby-trapped. The IDF also verified whether any personal belongings of the hostages were returned with the bodies. A brief military ceremony was held and presided over by the chief rabbi of the IDF before the bodies were taken to Israel for identification. Israelis waving national flags and yellow flags in solidarity with the hostages lined the route of the convoy carrying the bodies to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. There are now 69 hostages remaining in Hamas captivity in Gaza, of whom 36 are believed to be dead. Although the Israeli government has made the names public, official confirmation of the four hostages’ identity will depend on forensic analysis of the remains. On Wednesday, it emerged that the names were not to have been revealed prior to that confirmation, but were due to a miscommunication between the Israeli military and the government. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has urged the public to refrain from spreading rumors about the return of the slain captives and not to contact the families regarding the matter. 'The Coordinator for Captives and Missing Persons, Brigadier General (ret.) Gal Hirsch, has updated the families of the hostages through IDF representatives,' according to a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Thursday. 'In this difficult hour, our hearts are with the grieving families. We will continue to provide reliable information as required and request to avoid spreading rumors and unofficial information,' the statement continued. ‘Do not eulogize until there is confirmation‘ The Bibas family has issued a statement urging patience. 'If there is to be bitter news, we need to receive it through the proper channels after all identification procedures are completed. We ask not to eulogize our loved ones until there is confirmation after final identification,' it said.

'These hours are not simple for us, after being informed that our beloved Oded is on the list of deceased hostages to be returned to Israel on Thursday, after being taken alive from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz [on Oct. 7, 2023]. For 502 days we hoped and prayed for a different ending, but until we receive absolute certainty our journey will not end, and even afterward we will continue to fight until the return of the last hostage. We ask the media and the public not to contact us regarding this matter at present and to respect our privacy.' Early morning: Handover process to begin The initial stage of the handover involved the Red Cross receiving the fallen from Hamas at a predetermined location in Khan Yunis before transferring them to the IDF. Following the transfer, a military memorial ceremony took place inside Gaza, featuring the Israeli flag, a salute ceremony and a rabbi reciting from the Book of Psalms. Dr. Gilad Bodenheimer, who heads Mental Health Services at the Israeli Ministry of Health, has advised against extended viewing of broadcasts covering the return: 'We anticipate an extremely complex day as we receive the fallen hostages, and strongly recommend that the public limit their media exposure and minimize their viewing of Hamas psychological warfare tactics.'

Identification process Following their return to Israel, the coffins were transported under police escort directly to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. There, experts were set to conduct tests to determine the cause and time of death. The institute will employ standard identification methods including imaging scans, DNA sample extraction and laboratory analysis, and comparison with existing medical records such as dental X-rays. Reference samples have already been prepared, including DNA profiles provided by the Israel Police. According to the IDF, the identification process may take up to 48 hours, depending on the condition of the remains. The families will be integral to the entire process. At their own request, they will remain at home rather than at a designated location, accompanied by IDF representatives. They will observe the military ceremony in real time, with documentation to be distributed afterward. The IDF will inform the families of the identification results before any public announcement is made. Professor Chen Kugel, who directs the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, elaborated: 'We will exhaust every possibility to determine the circumstances of death. This isn’t always achievable, particularly with fallen who arrive after an extended period. Our commitment is to do everything possible to provide answers to the families about what happened to their loved ones.' The confidential clause Political officials have clarified that this release represents an unpublicized portion of the phase one ceasefire agreement, whereby eight hostages who died in captivity are to be returned in two stages. In exchange, Israel will free women and minors detained in Gaza after Oct. 7, 2023. Simultaneously, mediating parties are preparing for discussions about the deal’s second phase. Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari stated on Tuesday that negotiations for the second phase haven’t officially commenced, though he confirmed that delegations from both Israel and Hamas are present in Doha.

How Jewish traditions kept hostages alive in Gaza captivity	Agam Berger, Keith Siegel, and Eli Sharabi reported how they put faith in God, prayed and tried to keep Jewish holy days in captivity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Acts of Jewish faith helped keep several hostages alive, they have reported since being released from Hamas captivity over the last several weeks. IDF observer Agam Berger, who was abducted from the Nahal Oz army base on the border with Gaza, told Channel 12 Thursday that she and her fellow observers had managed to observe many of the Jewish holidays. 'We sometimes had access to a radio, and sometimes we saw things on television that helped us track the date. We also had a foreign calendar,' she said. 'We missed both Hanukkah holidays, but we celebrated Passover, and I didn’t eat chametz [leavened food products that are forbidden],' she noted. 'I asked for cornmeal, and the captors brought it to me.' Although the captives were given very little food, with the women previously revealing that they counted the rice grains they received to ensure everyone got an equal amount, Berger even observed several fast days. These included the two important ones, Yom Kippur and Tisha B’Av, but also Taanit Esther, which is a minor fast day that many do not keep under perfectly normal conditions. Berger also kept the Sabbath as much as she could and, with the other women, constantly used a prayerbook that a terrorist had found in a field. 'They asked us what it was and then gave it to us. We used it throughout our captivity,' she said, noting that her captors seemed to respect the fact that they wanted to perform Jewish rites, even giving them Sabbath candles to light at certain points. 'They said all of Judaism is a lie, but they preferred someone who believes in God over someone who doesn’t,' she said. In an interview on Channel 14 Wednesday, the daughter of American-Israel hostage Keith Siegel, said that her father had 'searched for his Jewish identity while in captivity, and he found it in small prayers.' 'He began saying blessings over food,' Shir Siegel said, 'which he had never said before, and ‘Shema Yisrael’, which he had never recited in his life.' The Shema is one of the iconic Jewish prayers that announces one’s belief in a single God of Israel. 'He said that amidst all that hell, he wanted to remember that he was Jewish, that there was meaning to his people and to the place from which he came, and that strengthened him greatly,' she said. Siegel was starved, moved 33 times over 15 months, was often kept in the dark while being told to lie down and keep silent, and spent the last two months of captivity alone. The Shema also featured strongly in the life of Eli Sharabi, who was freed on February 8. His brother Sharon told Channel 12 last week that every day of captivity, Eli had made sure to say the prayer. He and the other hostages he was with also kept track of the days of the week, and every Friday night, in honor of the incoming Sabbath, he would recite the Kiddush, a blessing recited over wine or grape juice before the meal – although they had nothing to drink or eat, as they were cruelly starved by their captors. They also sang the 'Woman of Valor' Sabbath song, which men traditionally sing each week in praise of their wives. All these acts of faith 'is what kept them going,' Sharabi said. Crushingly, Eli found out upon his release that his wife, Lianne, as well as his daughters Noya (16) and Yahel (13), had been murdered in their Kibbutz Be’eri home by terrorists during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 invasion, among 1,200 others slaughtered in Gaza envelope communities and a dance festival.

Blaming Netanyahu for captives’ deaths, Hamas uses coffins for vi...	Hamas uses coffins of dead captives for anti-Israel display during ceremony marking the handing over of remains of four Israeli hostages - while accusing IDF of killing the hostages. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization held a victory celebration in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Yunis Thursday morning, putting the coffins of four Israeli hostages on display before they were handed over to Israel as part of the hostage deal. At 9:40 a.m., Hamas transferred the remains of Oded Lifshitz, Shiri Bibas, and her sons Ariel and Kfir, to the International Red Cross, which handed the bodies over to an IDF force. Prior to the handoff, however, Hamas displayed the coffins of the four slain hostages on a stage set up on an abandoned cemetery in Khan Yunis, as part of a ceremony and photo op, during which Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the United States were denounced and blamed for the deaths of the four hostages. Masked Hamas terrorists met with International Red Cross officials on the stage, signing off papers certifying the transfer of the hostages' remains. The coffins of the four victims were displayed underneath a massive sign portraying Netanyahu as a vampire. 'The War Criminal Netanyahu & His Nazi Army Killed Them with Missiles from Zionist Warplanes,' the sign read. Mock missiles and rockets set up around the stage carried messages blaming the U.S. for the hostages' deaths. 'They were killed by USA bombs.' Underneath photographs of the hostages, Hamas wrote 'The Killer,' above a photograph of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, along with the date 11-2023, implying the hostages were killed in November 2023. During the victory ceremony in Khan Yunis, thousands of Gazans gathered and cheered as Hamas displayed the coffins of the slain hostages, clapping and whistling as organizers played celebratory music. Terrorists present at the event brandished weapons, including machine guns, grenades, anti-personnel mines, and even missiles. Mohammed Abu Warda, a Hamas terrorist and convicted mass murderer, was among those in attendance at the ceremony. Abu Warda, who was released as part of the hostage deal, was convicted of multiple counts of murder and sentenced to 48 consecutive life sentences for his role in a pair of suicide bomb attacks in the 1990s.

Trump admin designates drug cartels as global terrorist organizat...	Classifying the cartels as terrorist groups helps disrupt their 'finances through sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans,' though the scope of Wednesday's designations remains unclear, Reuters reported. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon The United States has designated Tren de Aragua, the Sinaloa cartel, and six other drug cartels as global terrorist organizations, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday in a notice. The cartels threaten U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economic stability, according to the notice. The designations follow President Donald Trump's executive order directing officials to assess whether transnational gangs and drug cartels should be classified as terrorist organizations. The move marks a significant escalation in Trump's efforts to combat cartel-driven crime following record-high illegal border crossings under the Biden administration. Classifying the cartels as terrorist groups helps disrupt their 'finances through sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans,' though the scope of Wednesday's designations remains unclear, Reuters reported. Last May, then-Drug Enforcement Administration head Anne Milgram, a Biden appointee, said the United States is facing 'the most dangerous and deadly drug crisis' in history, particularly pointing to 'synthetic, chemical-based drugs, like fentanyl and methamphetamine.' Fentanyl is responsible for around 70 percent of overdose deaths, the DEA noted at the time, with meth responsible for the remaining 30 percent. 'At the heart of the synthetic drug crisis are the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels and their associates,' Milgram said. Since taking office, Trump has declared a national border emergency and ordered top officials to prepare to invoke a 1798 law that could allow the administration to swiftly deport suspected gang members without court hearings. Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has reinforced border security and overseen the deportation of thousands of illegal immigrants. Tren de Aragua, a violent Venezuelan gang, has expanded its operations across several U.S. cities, terrorizing residents at apartment complexes and engaging in human trafficking, extortion, and drug smuggling. Federal authorities have arrested dozens affiliated with the gang, including 67 members on January 26 alone. Mexico's Sinaloa cartel is 'woven into our communities,' both in major U.S. cities and other places, retired Drug Enforcement Administration supervisory special agent Brian Townsend told Fox News on Tuesday. 'We have some larger locations that are well known for Sinaloa control, like Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Tucson, Dallas, Atlanta, and New York City.' 'But they have distribution points throughout the United States,' Townsend went on, 'and from there, they use those hubs, and then [the distribution] spoke out from there into our communities.'

Israeli forces kill three armed terrorists near Jenin	Following the engagement, security forces conducted thorough searches, uncovering a disassembled M-16 rifle hidden underground, additional weaponry, and a handgun. By JNS Israeli forces killed three armed terrorists in the Al-Fara area south of Jenin in northern Samaria on Wednesday, according to the military. The coordinated counterterrorism operation involved Israel Defense Forces soldiers alongside the Israel Border Police’s 'Yamam' National Counter-Terrorism Unit, guided by Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) intelligence. According to the IDF, the terrorists were involved in weapons trafficking. Two additional suspects were apprehended during the operation.

ICC used flawed data to secure arrest warrants against Israeli le...	UKLFI’s latest review shows that reports of famine on which the prosecutor relied were not plausible and were based on inaccurate and anomalous data regarding food supplies and malnutrition.' By Jewish Breaking News Significant errors and flawed methodology tainted the evidence of famine in Gaza that led to the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to UK Lawyers for Israel Charitable Trust (UKLFI), the evidence for these claims simply doesn’t hold up. First, the very definition of famine was misapplied. The term 'famine' isn’t just dramatic language but rather a specific scientific classification developed in Somalia in 2004 by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. UKLFI’s report argues that Gaza’s crisis, while 'undoubtedly serious,' doesn’t meet these technical standards. Second, the ICC relied heavily on data from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS Net), a USAID initiative that’s now offline following Trump administration funding freezes. Third, the report identifies what it calls 'inaccurate and anomalous data' about food supplies and malnutrition rates, suggesting that worst-case scenarios were presented as inevitable outcomes rather than possibilities. 'Warrants for the arrest of Netanyahu and Gallant have been issued by the ICC on the false ground that Israel deliberately used starvation as a method of war,' says Jonathan Turner, UKLFI’s executive director. 'UKLFI’s latest review shows that reports of famine on which the prosecutor relied were not plausible and were based on inaccurate and anomalous data regarding food supplies and malnutrition.' UKLFI’s report calls for more rigorous standards in assessing humanitarian crises, including clearer distinctions between current conditions, projections, and worst-case scenarios. The stakes are too high for anything less. Just recently, ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan found himself banned from entering the U.S. under new sanctions. President Donald Trump’s executive order blasted what he called the court’s 'illegitimate and baseless actions' against Israel. Meanwhile, the ICC’s oversight body has been tasked to investigate allegations that Khan tried to coerce a female aide against her will. Khan has repeatedly denied the allegations, stating there is 'no truth' to the claim.

Trump halts US funding of Palestinian police – report	The cut in funding is part of the Trump administration’s overall freeze on international aid. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The U.S. has frozen funding for the Palestinian Authority's (PA) security forces, as part of the Trump administration’s overall freeze on international aid, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. In Trump’s first stint as president, he stopped direct aid to the PA but kept on funding the training of its security forces, which is implemented through the U.S. Security Coordinator’s Office (USSC) in Jerusalem. The paper cited an anonymous former Israeli official as saying that the USSC 'was not significantly affected' by the cut, as 'other donors have committed to make up the shortfall.' Palestinian sources say that there have been immediate ramifications due to the freeze. A colonel in the PA’s Central Training Institute told the Post that as a result of the freeze it had to stop construction of a virtual shooting range, although it was nearly complete. The security forces officially learn to shoot this way because out of security concerns, Israel forbids the importation of real bullets to the PA. The tens of thousands of men dispersed among the various branches of the Palestinian Security Services are well-armed, however, as evidenced by the recent deadly clashes in Jenin, when the PA failed in its attempt to take control of the city that is a hotbed of terrorist groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad that want to overthrow the Authority. Another Palestinian official said that a meeting that had been organized between PA and American security forces to assess the PA’s performance in Jenin had been indefinitely postponed. The USSC has been providing direct financial and personnel assistance to Palestinian security organizations since 2005 and training them since 2007. According to the State Department, besides upgrading the Palestinians’ military abilities to 'assist in ending violence' internally, another major part of its mission is to 'facilitat[e] security cooperation' with Israel, and 'setting security conditions for a peace agreement.' One of its original aims was also to 'allay Israeli fears about the nature and capabilities of the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF),' in the words of Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton, who led the Office for its first five years. While top Israeli military and intelligence officials have considered security coordination with the PA as vital to the IDF’s anti-terror efforts in Judea and Samaria throughout the years, the government also sees the PASF as a danger. Although potential recruits are officially extensively vetted by the U.S. for any affiliation with a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization and for human rights violations, Palestinian security personnel have been responsible for hundreds of terror attacks on Israeli civilians over the past two decades.

The power of faith: How Tzili Schneider became a beacon of hope f...	Schneider's journey with the families of Israel’s hostages did not begin with a grand strategy, but with a deep, empathetic connection to their suffering—one that ultimately reignited the nation’s faith. By Linda Argalgi Sadacka, Special to World Israel News In times of profound adversity, certain individuals emerge as beacons of hope, transforming personal anguish into collective resilience. Tzili Schneider, founder of Kesher Yehudi (Jewish Connection), is one such figure. Her journey with the families of Israel’s hostages did not begin with a grand strategy, but with a deep, empathetic connection to their suffering—one that ultimately reignited the nation’s faith. A mission born from heartbreak Moved by the plight of parents, siblings, and children of those taken captive, Tzili immersed herself in the protest tents of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, offering support in the only way that truly mattered: by listening. She posed a pivotal question to these families: 'What do you desire most?' The answer was immediate and unanimous: 'Our children.' But then she asked a deeper question: 'From whom are you seeking their return?' Tzili Schneider (back shown) comforts Merav Gonen, mother of freed hostage Romi Gonen. Door on right leads to a synagogue. (Courtesy) The realization was profound. Beyond political figures, beyond military strategies, beyond backdoor negotiations—their hope rested in a higher power: God. It was this moment of clarity that led Tzili to propose something radical: a national call for faith—a single, unified Shabbat (Sabbath) observed across the country as a plea for divine mercy. This was not a tactical maneuver. It was a recognition of an eternal truth: Jewish survival has never been political. It has always been spiritual. A movement that transcended divisions The response was overwhelming. Communities across Israel mobilized, bridging gaps between secular and religious Jews in a way that had seemed impossible just weeks before. Through Kesher Yehudi, Tzili spearheaded this unprecedented movement, guiding over 35 hostage families toward a deeper spiritual connection. This unity was not about external labels. It was about an unshakable Jewish instinct—the knowledge that, in times of crisis, Jews trust one another. The lookouts stationed on the border, the kidnapped soldiers, the civilians dragged into Gaza—all of them had endured the valley of the shadow of death with one unifying truth: They never lost their faith. Faith in the depths of Gaza These hostages did not emerge from the tunnels of Gaza as the same people they were before. Throughout their captivity, they clung to Jewish identity as a lifeline—observing mitzvot (Torah commandments) wherever and however they could. They fasted on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), refrained from eating non-kosher food, and even kept Shabbat in the heart of enemy territory. The lookouts, in particular, observed several mitzvot together, including Yom Kippur, Tisha B’Av (the Ninth of Av, a day of mourning for the destruction of the Temples), and avoiding chametz (leavened bread) on Pesach (Passover). Not a single one of them agreed to eat chametz throughout the entire holiday. They knew exactly which day was Shabbat and did their best to observe it. Among them, Agam Berger, an IDF surveillance soldier, became a pillar of strength. Captured during the attack on Nahal Oz on October 7, 2023, she endured 482 days in captivity—and throughout it all, she refused to compromise her faith. She fully observed Shabbat and refused to eat non-kosher meat, even as her captors starved her. Not once did she break, despite her friends pleading with her to eat for her own survival. When Agam’s mother, Meirav Berger, learned of her release, she was filled with gratitude—not only for her daughter’s return but for the unwavering faith that sustained her through captivity. 'We saw God with our own eyes' This was not an isolated phenomenon. Every hostage who emerged from Gaza carried the same testimony: 'We saw God with our own eyes.' For Romi Gonen, the first girl to be released in the most recent deal, the experience of captivity led to a profound transformation. Her mother, Merav Gonen, was the very first person to sign up for a national Shabbat initiative, dedicating her observance to the release of the hostages. Exactly one year later, Romi was freed. When she finally embraced her mother, her first words were not about the suffering she endured. Instead, she declared: 'I am Jewish. I was in captivity, and there I truly felt that I was Jewish. And being Jewish means keeping Shabbat. So from now on, we will keep Shabbat.' She was not alone. Kfir Segal, an elderly Jewish man, endured some of the harshest conditions of captivity. His captors starved him, humiliated him, spat on him, and beat him—yet his faith remained unshaken. Freed hostage Agam Berger, who has spoken publicly about maintaining her faith during captivity, receives a prayer book from Tzili Schneider. (Courtesy) Upon his release, he turned to his children and made a single request: 'We had 500 days to reflect on ourselves. A lot of time to think. My thoughts led me to God and to the realization that I am Jewish. From now on, I want all of us to sit together and learn about our own Judaism.' The Kiddush that kept hope alive Omer Shem Tov was taken captive on Shabbat Kodesh (the holy Sabbath) and remains in captivity to this day. Just a few days after his abduction, by Tuesday or Wednesday, he turned to his friend Itai and asked: 'Shabbat is coming soon. How will we make Kiddush (blessing over wine or grape juice to sanctify the Shabbat and holidays)? I have never missed reciting Kiddush on Shabbat.' Itai asked their captors about it, and the next day, they received a tiny bottle of grape juice. Omer carefully rationed the bottle, using just a drop each week for Kiddush, knowing that their captivity could last years. Every Shabbat, he recited Kiddush by heart in the darkness of the tunnels. His mother, Shelly Shem Tov, became fully Shabbat-observant as a result. She joined a group of women learning the laws of Shabbat, determined that when Omer returns, everything in their home will be done according to halacha (Jewish law). The same was true for Sasha Tropanov, whose mother and grandmother were kidnapped alongside him. They were freed in the first hostage deal over a year ago—and each of them independently decided to become religious. In a now-viral video, Sasha is seen wearing tefillin (phylacteries) upon his return home this past Shabbat, his first request after being reunited with his family. His mother, Yelena, always knew that when he came back, he would follow the same spiritual path she had chosen. Because when you see God with your own eyes, there is no other path. The time for faith and unity is now These are not stories of religious coercion. They are stories of spiritual awakening—of Jews who faced the abyss, held onto their identity, and emerged with an unshakable belief in Hashem’s (G-d’s) presence in their lives. This is the lesson that Tzili Schneider and Kesher Yehudi have been working tirelessly to share: Faith is not a relic of the past. It is the foundation of Jewish survival. The hostages have returned with a message: Our future belongs to those who stand firm, who hold fast to their faith, and who refuse to surrender—no matter the cost.

Republicans divided over Trump’s Gaza plan	Americans largely oppose president's plan to take control of the Gaza Strip, new polls find, with Republicans sharply divided over the proposal. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Few Americans support President Donald Trump's plan to place the war torn Gaza Strip under U.S. control, with even the president's own party sharply divided over the proposal. According to a poll published by Quinnipiac University on Wednesday, just 22% of registered voters say they back Trump's bid to take over the Gaza Strip, compared to 62% of respondents who oppose it. A plurality of Republicans back the plan, with 49% saying they support it, compared to 32% who oppose it. However, just 1% of Democrats support the proposal, compared to 94% who oppose it. Among independents, just 17% say they support the plan, compared to 66% who oppose it. 'The grand plan to transform a shattered Gaza into a lavish American restoration project on the Mediterranean has many more skeptics than supporters,' said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy. Respondents were somewhat more supportive of Trump's handling of the Israel - Hamas conflict, with 38% said they approved of his policies on the issue, including 78% of Republicans, 37% of independents, and 4% of Democrats. By contrast, 47% of registered voters disapprove, including 9% of Republicans, 48% of independents, and 87% of Democrats. A second poll released Wednesday also found little support for Trump's Gaza plan. The survey, conducted by Emerson College Polling, found that just 18% of Americans support Trump's Gaza plan, with 58% opposing it. Unlike the Quinnipiac poll, Emerson found that a plurality of Republicans oppose the proposal, by a margin of 45% against to 31% in favor. Just 12% of Democrats and 10% of independents back the plan. Trump's Gaza plan appears to be significantly more popular among Israelis, however, with 75% of Israeli Jews telling the Lazar Research Institute in a recent poll that they support the proposal. The Quinnipiac poll surveyed 1,039 self-identified registered voters nationwide from February 13th through the 17th, and has a margin of error of +/- 3.0 points. The Emerson poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters and has a similar margin of error. It was conducted from February 15th through the 17th.

Hamas hands over the remains of four Israeli civilians - including the two youngest hostages - to Israel via the International Red Cross. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization handed over the remains of four slain Israeli civilians held hostage since October 7th, 2023, to the International Red Cross Thursday morning, as part of the ongoing hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire. The captives include 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, 33-year-old Shiri Bibas, and her two sons - the youngest Israelis taken hostage by Gazan terrorists on October 7th - Ariel and Kfir. The two boys would have been five and two years old respectively. After an event held by Hamas in the Bani Suheila neighborhood of the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis Thursday morning, during which four coffins were presented on stage, the remains of the four Israeli captives were transferred to the International Red Cross at 9:50 a.m. Half an hour later, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office announced that the coffins carrying the four slain hostages had been handed over to an IDF force. 'Israel has received, through the Red Cross, the coffins of four fallen hostages,' the PMO said. 'The coffins were handed over to the IDF and Shin Bet forces, within the Gaza Strip area, from where they will be transferred to Israel to the National Forensic Medicine Institute of the Ministry of Health. After the identification process is completed, an official notice will be delivered to the families.' 'The families of the hostages have been updated, and in this difficult time, our hearts are with them.' Lifshitz, a former journalist, was abducted, along with his wife Yocheved, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th, 2023, before their home was torched by Hamas terrorists. The couple have been described as peace activists who volunteered to drive Gazans from the border into Israel for medical treatment. Shiri Bibas and her children, Ariel and Kfir, were also residents of Nir Oz. Video taken at around 10:00 a.m. on October 7th shows the three being taken hostage by a group of terrorists aligned with the Katayeb al-Mujahideen group. 'Agony. Pain. There are no words,' President Isaac Herzog said Thursday morning following the transfer of the hostages' remains. 'Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters.' 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely. May their memory be a blessing.'

Religious Zionism: If Gaza war ends, we’ll leave the gov’t	MK Moshe Solomon stresses his party will leave the coalition, if Israel does not return to fighting Hamas by March 2nd. By World Israel News Staff A politician from the Religious Zionism party stressed his faction's position that Israel must resume hostilities against the Hamas terror group, or else face the collapse of the government. MK Moshe Solomon said in a recent radio interview that the second phase of the hostage deal requires a full IDF withdrawal from Gaza and a long-term ceasefire, which his party is unwilling to support. 'I expect [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] and cabinet to fulfil their commitment where we complete phase 1 of the deal and [then] act with military force against the Hamas terror organization. I believe this is how we can bring back the hostages who are [still] there,' Solomon told Radio North. 'Currently, phase 1 has ended with everything that was promised, despite Hamas's violations.' When asked about phase two of the deal, which would see Israeli troops retreat from Gaza in exchanged for the return of additional live hostages, Solomon said it 'won't happen.' Solomon noted that the ceasefire outlined in the first stage of the deal is slated to last for 42 days. If Israel does not return to fighting on Sunday, March 2nd, Religious Zionism will leave the government, Solomon added. Opposition parties, including Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid, have pledged to provide a safety net to Netanyahu's Likud, in order to ensure the hostage deal continues. The status of negotiations for the terms of the second phase of the ceasefire is currently unclear. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff has expressed confidence that despite the concerns of some right-wing Israeli parties, the second stage of the ceasefire and hostage deal will happen. Speaking to Fox News earlier this week, Witkoff said that 'phase two is absolutely going to begin.' He added at a memorial event marking 500 days since October 7th, 2023, that 'we are not leaving anybody behind. We have to get everybody home.'

Ari Fuld’s murderer and other terrorists to be freed Saturday	There’s no guidebook for how to feel when your brother is murdered and gone forever, while his killer will walk free,' writes Hillel Fuld. By World Israel News Staff A number of high-profile terrorists, including the man who killed American-Israeli Ari Fuld, are set to be freed Saturday in exchange for the return of six Israeli hostages from Hamas captivity. The release will see 602 terrorists freed from Israeli prisons, including 157 sentenced to life or decades-long sentences. The murderer of Ari Fuld, Khalil Yusef Ali Jabarin, who was 17 at the time of the murder, is slated to be released after spending just six years in an Israeli prison. 'The monster who changed our family forever is now on the list of terrorists set to be freed as part of the upcoming hostage deal. Upon hearing the news of this terrorist's release, I had to catch my breath,' wrote Fuld's brother Hillel, a prominent tech blogger and consultant, in a column published in Ynet. 'There’s no guidebook for how to feel when your brother is murdered and gone forever, while his killer will walk free and live as a regular citizen.' While Fuld stressed that he felt extremely conflicted about the release, he added that he understood the release would save the lives of the hostages - which brings him some comfort. Another notorious terrorist scheduled for release on Saturday is Bilal Abu Ghanem, who murdered three Israelis in a shooting and stabbing spree on a Jerusalem bus in October 2015. Originally sentenced to 135 years, Abu Ghanem will be freed after serving less than ten years for the murders of Haim Haviv, 78, Alon Govberg, 51, and Richard Lakin, 76. Na’el al-Barghouti, 68, is also expected to be released after serving 45 years for the 1978 murder of bus driver Mordechai Yakuel. Notably, al-Barghouti was freed in the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal, but later re-arrested. He will likely be deported to a third country. According to Hebrew-language media reports, al-Barghouti is a relative and close confidant of arch-terrorist Marwan Barghouti.

Woman wounded in Jerusalem axe attack, police hunt assailant	Suspect broke into elderly woman's home and attacked her with an axe; police launch manhunt to arrest perpetrator. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli woman was attacked by an axe-wielding assailant late Wednesday night, with the manhunt for the perpetrator still ongoing. The victim, reported by Hebrew-language media as being in her 70s, was moderately wounded in the attack, which occurred at her home in the Old City. According to Ynet, the suspect, armed with an axe, broke into the woman's home. After the attack, he reportedly removed the hoodie he had been wearing - likely due to blood stains - and fled the scene. 'I arrived at the scene and saw the victim, [who was] fully conscious. She was lying [on the floor] with injuries to her upper body,' said Yossi Kasuto, a senior Magen David Adom paramedic, in a media statement. 'I gave her life-saving medical treatment and we transferred her to the special MDA ATV that evacuated her through the narrow alleyways of Jerusalem&#8230;to an ambulance that was waiting at the Zion Gate. From there we evacuated her while continuing medical treatment to the hospital, with her condition [being] moderate and stable.' The police said in a press statement that they had dispatched forensic officers to gather evidence at the scene;. The Jerusalem Police District Commander 'conducted a situational assessment, during which he directed the use of all means and forces in order to locate the suspect who fled.' As of Thursday, the police have yet to locate the attacker. Details about his identity and the motivation for the attack have not yet been made public. In December 2024, a janitor who worked in a Jerusalem apartment building broke into the home of an elderly Jewish woman. He strangled and stabbed the woman, 74, then stole her jewelry and fled the apartment, believing he had murdered her. The woman, seriously wounded, managed to call for help. The suspect was arrested hours later, and the attempted murder was classified as a terror attack by Israeli authorities.

Berger, 20, was one of five lookouts who scouted the Gaza border, were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023 and released after 15 months. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, U.S. President Trump reposted a video of freed hostage Agam Berger, who thanked him for securing her release and advocating for the other hostages. Berger, 20, was one of five lookouts who scouted the Gaza border and were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. She was released in the first phase of the hostage deal. Berger thanked Trump, saying, 'From the bottom of my heart, thank you for all you have done and all that you continue to do for the hostages.' 'Because of you, we came home,' she said, explaining that there are still people who depend on him and are waiting for him to save them. Berger added that President Trump 'has the power to do it.' The hostage deal took effect on January 19, the day before Trump's inauguration as President of the United States. 'I beg you, don’t stop until all the hostages, both the living and the dead, are brought home,' Berger said to Trump. Donald Trump Truth Social Post 07:45 PM EST 02/17/25 pic.twitter.com/ngMTnpnxX7 &mdash; Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) February 18, 2025 On Thursday, the bodies of four hostages, including Shiri Bibas and her two young children, will be returned to Gaza. On Saturday, six living hostages are expected to be released. Berger was released along with Israeli civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80 along with five Thai workers. The other four female IDF lookouts, Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev, and Daniella Gilboa, were released a week earlier. Dr. Lena Koren Feldman, director of Rabin Medical Center’s Beilinson Hospital, told Israel’s Channel 12 News that the four IDF soldiers kidnapped alongside Berger and who were released by Hamas on Saturday screamed with excitement when they saw her being freed. Agam Berger and other hostages maintained religious observance during their captivity in Gaza. Liri Albag reported that Agam Berger held fast to her religious observance during her captivity, including keeping kosher and observing Shabbat. 'Despite the difficult conditions and limited options, Agam chose to stay true to her values and her faith,' Liri said. Liri’s mother, Merav, said that her daughter did not eat any of the non-kosher meat offered to her during captivity, despite the lack of food. Prior to her daughter’s release, Merav Berger requested that if her daughter would be released on Saturday, that those involved and the media should avoid violating Shabbat.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A forensic expert stated that identifying the bodies of hostages who have been held in Gaza for an extended period may not always be possible. On Thursday, the bodies of four hostages, held in captivity for over 500 days, are expected to be returned to Israel. Dr. Chen Kugel, director of the L. Greenberg Institute of Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir, described the process of examining and identifying the bodies before they are sent for burial. Dr. Kugel will work alongside pathologists, DNA analysts, anthropologists, radiologists, and forensic technicians. Kugel explained that identification is carried out using various scientific methods, all of which involve comparing data from the deceased with records from when they were still living. The first step in the process is a CT scan, which creates a detailed internal image. Radiologists then compare this image with previous medical records. The next phase is the autopsy, during which DNA samples will be sent to the lab for analysis, and forensic dentists will compare the teeth with existing dental records. The entire process will take several days. Afterward, the family will be contacted, and the public will receive updates, if permitted by the family. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Medical Directorate at the Health Ministry, stated, 'The upcoming phase tomorrow is both complex and sensitive, and we will do everything in our power to ensure the slain hostages are laid to rest as swiftly as possible.' Israel is preparing to receive the bodies of hostages who were murdered in captivity in the Gaza Strip on Thursday. The ceasefire deal with the Palestinian terrorist group stipulates that the bodies of four hostages will be returned to the Jewish state on the 33rd day of the ceasefire, which began on Jan. 19. Among those whose bodies will be handed over to Israel on Thursday are Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir.

By Aamer Madhani, Jonathan Cooper, Associated Press President Donald Trump called Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections,' lashing out after the Ukrainian president said Trump was being influenced by Russian disinformation as he moves to end the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow. Trump called Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections,' lashing out after the Ukrainian president said Trump was being influenced by Russian disinformation as he moves to end the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow. In a post on Truth Social, Trump called Zelenskyy 'a modestly successful comedian' who talked the United States into spending billions of dollars 'to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start.' He said Ukraine would be unable to end the war without Trump’s help. Trump’s post comes a day after he suggested in a news conference that Ukraine should hold elections as part of a peace plan. 'A Dictator without Elections,' Trump wrote Wednesday. Zelenskyy was elected president in 2019 after a career as an entertainer. He resisted pressure to leave the country when Russia invaded in 2022, mounting a defense that protected the capital, Kyiv. Zelenskyy accused Trump earlier Wednesday of living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space.'

Bibas family ‘in deep turmoil’ following Hamas announcement	Bibas family: 'Until we receive definitive confirmation, our ordeal is not over. We kindly ask the media and the public to respect our privacy and refrain from contacting us about this issue.' The Bibas family said on Tuesday that they were troubled by a Hamas statement earlier in the day that the bodies of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, are among those the terrorist group will return to Israel on Thursday. 'In the past few hours, we have been in deep turmoil following the announcement by a Hamas spokesperson regarding the planned return of our beloved Shiri, Ariel and Kfir this Thursday as part of the release of hostages’ remains,' the family said in a statement provided by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. 'We want to emphasize that while we are aware of these reports, we have not received any official confirmation on the matter,' the statement continued. 'Until we receive definitive confirmation, our ordeal is not over. We kindly ask the media and the public to respect our privacy and refrain from contacting us about this issue.' The Israel Defense Forces also responded to the reports, emphasizing that the public should follow official military statements regarding the state of the hostages. 'In the past few hours, unfounded rumors have been spreading regarding the hostages and their families,' the IDF said. 'The IDF urges the public to rely only on official statements from authorized sources and to refrain from spreading false rumors that harm the hostages’ families and the public.' Hamas agreed on Tuesday to double the number of living hostages it will release on Saturday from three to six, and the terror group has also said that it will release the bodies of four dead hostages on Thursday, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two children. Shiri Bibas, 33, her husband Yarden, 35, and Ariel, 5 and Kfir, 2, were on the list of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement. However, Hamas had claimed in November 2023 that Shiri and the children had been killed. Yarden was freed alive on Feb. 1 along with Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegel. Eight of the 33 hostages intended for release during the first phase are dead, according to a list provided by Hamas. Hamas named the Israelis to be freed on Saturday as Tal Shoham, Omer Shem-Tov, Omer Wenkert and Eliya Cohen, all of whom were kidnapped during the terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. In addition, Hamas said it would also release Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who have been held captive in the Strip for a decade and reportedly suffer from mental illness. An Israeli official told Maariv on Tuesday that the body of Hadar Goldin will not be returned to Israel this week but is expected to be transferred toward the end of phase one next week. Hamas has held Goldin’s body since he was killed during 'Operation Protective Edge' in 2014.

New Syrian textbooks designed to produce more jihadis	In the new schoolbooks, the role of women in Arab history is being deliberately downplayed; for Islam relegates women to a lower rank than men. By Hugh Fitzgerald, Frontpage Magazine The new textbooks in Syria of course eliminate all praise, direct and indirect, of the Assad family, father and son, but when it comes to Israel and Jews, those textbooks remain unchanged: 'New Syrian government issues textbooks filled with antisemitism and praise for terrorists,' by Jane Prinsley, Jewish Chronicle, February 7, 2025: Multiple maps in a geography textbook for 14 – 15-year-olds present all of Israel’s internationally recognized territory as Palestine. The Israel-controlled Golan Heights are presented as part of Syria, and the textbook cover features an image of the Sea of Galilee, which is located within Israeli territory, potentially suggesting that the lake, or parts of it, belong to Syria. It’s unclear whether Israel is depicted as existing within the 1949 armistice lines, or if has been effaced altogether. What is clear is that the Israel that now exists is not shown on those maps. Some historical women have been removed, including references to Nazik al-Abid, known as the 'Joan of Arc of the Arabs', Queen Zenobia and Khawla bint al-Azwar, in Islamic education and social studies textbooks for children aged eight to nine years old…. In the new schoolbooks, the role of women in Arab history is being deliberately downplayed; for Islam relegates women to a lower rank than men. In the 20th century, Nazik al-Abid obtained her fame as a defender of women’s rights; this is not a cause that the new Islamic regime would favor. Queen Zenobia dates from the 3rd century A.D., which means she lived during the Time of Ignorance, the Jahaliyya, so is hardly someone to emulate or admire. And Khawla bint al-Azwar, a warrior during the time of the Rashidun, believed that Ali was the first rightly-guided caliph, making her in effect a Shi’a, and she would naturally have no place in the schoolbook pantheon of the new, uber-Sunni regime in Damascus. The watchdog also found that some 'secular scientific concepts perceived to be un-Islamic' have been removed. An entire chapter in a biology textbook for 13 – 14-year-olds on evolution has been removed. All devout Muslims know that 'evolution' is only a 'theory.' And since evolution is contradicted by Islamic teachings, it is best to put off teaching it to students until they can be 'Islamically' prepared to withstand its appeal, 'Martyrdom' will be reframed in the new textbooks from a national to a religious perspective. One year 10 lesson will glorify martyrdom as an exalted deed worthy of reward by Allah, by replacing the term 'a person giving away his soul to defend his homeland' with 'a person giving away his soul for the sake of Allah.' The nationalist message has been eliminated, to be replaced by an Islamic one: children are not told to sacrifice for the 'homeland' of Syria but to become, rather, martyrs for the sake of Allah. And what is to be done 'for the sake of Allah'? Sacrificing yourself to promote the spread of Islam, expanding the umma, and killing Infidels. Just like Dalia al-Mughrabi, who was killed during the Coastal Road Massacre, in which she helped to murder 38 Israeli civilians, including 13 children. Al-Mughrabi is in the new textbooks, held up as a model to be emulated. The main backer of al-Jolani’s rebel group HTS in its war against Assad was Erdogan’s Turkey. Turkey is still the main foreign backer of the new regime in Damascus, though there may later be a parting of the ways if Turkey insists on keeping a military presence in northern Syria to suppress the Kurds. But right now, Turkey is a friend, and the Ottomans need to be referred to without animus. Thus, the Ottoman 'occupation' mentioned in Assad-era textbooks has now become the Ottoman 'regime,' which is not pejorative but simply matter-of-fact. There is also no more emphasis on Syria itself, as was found in previous textbooks. Now the focus is squarely on Islam, and the worldwide umma. Statements against Jews remain, as do those against all the Western powers — warmongers and exploiters who suck the 'blood of the innocents.' Al-Jolani’s repeatedly expressed desire to focus only on Syria, making sure that all of its armed groups give up their weapons and become part of a national army, and his unwillingness to try to pressure Israel to withdraw from the territory it has just taken over on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, are reassuring. But then there are those new schoolbooks, just released, that have become even more Islamic in their contents, and that will influence the minds of Syrian children, whose Islam-infused curriculum will lead some of them inexorably to become jihadis themselves. The Israelis, who continue to hold back from responding to what some have taken to be overtures made by al-Jolani to the Jewish state, are right to do so. If you are wondering why, just look at what remains and what has been changed, for the worse, in the new textbooks now to be used in Syrian schools; Impact-se lays it all out.

First Jewish delegation in 33 years visits Damascus	During their visit the group toured the Jewish cemetery in Damascus, paying respects at the tomb of Rabbi Chaim Vital, according to Haredi Israeli news portal JDN. By Joshua Marks, JNS A delegation of Syrian-Jewish Americans toured Damascus on Tuesday, with approval from the transitional government that took power following the fall of the Assad regime in December. The visit, organized by the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a Washington-based advocacy group established in 2011 to support the then-Syrian opposition, included prominent figures such as Rabbi Yosef Hamra, a former leader of Syrian Jewry, and Rabbi Asher Lopatin, the director of Community Relations of Ann Arbor, Michigan’s Jewish Federation, alongside other Syrian Jews residing in the United States. Syrian Jews return to visit their homes in Damascus for the first time in decades. Facilitated by SETF, this latest delegation marks a new chapter for post-Assad Syria, one that welcomes all religions and sects. #Syria #syrianjews #syriajewishcommunity pic.twitter.com/7ebFMXRhUb &mdash; Syrian Emergency Task Force (@syrianetf) February 18, 2025 During their visit the group toured the Jewish cemetery in Damascus, paying respects at the tomb of Rabbi Chaim Vital, according to Haredi Israeli news portal JDN. They also visited historic Jewish sites, including the largely destroyed Jobar Synagogue, as well as the Al-Franj and Al-Raki synagogues and the Maimonides Jewish School. Hamra, who was forced to leave Syria in 1992, described his return to his homeland after 33 years as deeply emotional. He urged Jews in the West to visit Syria and see its changes for themselves, suggesting that some might even consider returning. His son, Henry, held up a Torah scroll alongside his father inside the Al-Franj Synagogue in the Jewish quarter in Old Damascus’ Bab Sharqi neighborhood. Founded by Sephardic Jews, it is the last synagogue in Syria used for worship by Jews. Henry Hamra told Reuters that Syria’s foreign ministry has pledged to protect Jewish heritage sites following a meeting with the deputy foreign minister. 'We need the government’s help, we need the government’s security and it’s going to happen,' he said. 'I want to see my kids come back and see this beautiful synagogue. It’s a work of art,' Henry added. Moaz Mustafa, head of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, emphasized the significance of this visit—the first Jewish delegation in 33 years—and underscored the new government’s support for the return of all Syrians. 'Very few Jews remain in Syria. We want the international community to help rebuild synagogues and lift sanctions on Syria,' he said, assuring Syrian Jews that 'your homeland is safe—you can return.' JNS reported in January that the chief rabbi of the Syrian Jewish community in Israel wrote to the new leader of Syria, congratulating him on his victory in ousting the Assad dictatorship and encouraging him to preserve the heritage sites of the country’s historic Jewish community. 'For thousands of years, the Jewish community in Syria, despite being a small minority, has been an integral part of the rich and diverse fabric of the Syrian people,' Rabbi Binyamin Hamra wrote to Ahmed al-Sharaa in the letter. 'Throughout Syria are historical sites, ancient synagogues, and tombs of great Jewish leaders, which constitute cultural and religious heritage for Jews throughout the world,' he wrote. Hamra’s father, Rabbi Avraham Hamra, served as the last chief rabbi of Syria from 1972 to 1992, before leaving for Israel via New York. A mass exodus of thousands of Jews from Syria was made possible after then-Syrian president Hafez al-Assad lifted a travel ban on the country’s historic Jewish community, leaving less than 10 Jews in the Syrian capital. Only two Jews, a brother and sister, remain in Syria today, according to Judy Feld Carr, a musicologist in Toronto who quietly rescued more than 3,000 Syrian Jews between 1977 and 2001. A study from Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC), a Jewish-American organization, published in December, puts the number of Jewish residents in Syria at four. According to the study, the value of property confiscated from Syria’s Jewish community exceeds $10 billion in contemporary terms.

GOP senators put Red Cross on notice after ‘neutral’ aid organiza...	During the hostages' time in captivity, the Red Cross did not fulfill its mandate to visit them and assess their health, as the group routinely does in traditional conflicts. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon When Hamas gunmen paraded emaciated Israeli hostages across a stage in Gaza earlier this month, they were flanked by two representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), an aid group that boasts of its neutrality. The agency’s participation in the choreographed propaganda display—as well as its failure to visit the hostages as they struggled in captivity—is now drawing scrutiny on Capitol Hill, with GOP lawmakers questioning the Red Cross’s objectivity and care for those still held in captivity. The most shocking scene to date unfolded two weekends ago, when Hamas terrorists forced three severely malnourished Israeli captives—Ohad Ben Ami, 56; Eli Sharabi, 52; and Or Levy, 34—to make a speech to a crowd of Gazans before their release. Standing beside the masked gunmen were two Red Cross officials identified by the Washington Free Beacon as Nour Khadam and Stephanie Eller, both of whom have been featured in the ICRC's online materials. Footage from the hostage release shows Khadam shaking hands with a Hamas terrorist as Eller stands behind him, and a masked Hamas terrorist snaps photographs. Like other Red Cross officials present at these stage-managed events—reportedly produced by an Al Jazeera journalist—Eller and Khadam signed documents and stood on hand while the terror group forced the hostages to thank their captors. Photos taken on the day show the Israelis holding certificates provided by Hamas as they are interviewed next to gun-touting terrorists. The Red Cross's involvement in the Hamas propaganda ritual came more than a year after the terror group kidnapped 251 people, including Americans, in its Oct. 7 attack. During the hostages' time in captivity, the Red Cross did not fulfill its mandate to visit them and assess their health, as the group routinely does in traditional conflicts. The scenes have drawn outrage in both Israel and the United States, with President Donald Trump likening the hostages to 'Holocaust survivors' and casting doubt on the ceasefire’s durability. On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, lawmakers have taken note of the Red Cross’s participation in these ceremonies and said the aid agency is jeopardizing its image as an unbiased actor. While the United States has long been the committee's top funder, senior Senate sources say there is talk of reassessing American funding to the ICRC while GOP officials examine its ties to Hamas. 'Where was the Red Cross’s increasing concern for the safety and well-being of the hostages these last 493 days?' Sen. Ted Budd (R., N.C.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told the Free Beacon. 'Participating in Hamas’s propaganda ceremonies definitely calls into question their supposed neutrality. Seems like the ICRC is more concerned about their public image than actually fulfilling their mission to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict.' The pictures of starving hostages that have emerged over the past month, a senior Senate adviser said, raise serious questions about whether the Red Cross is living up to its lofty mandate. In its mission statement, the ICRC calls itself 'neutral, impartial, and independent,' a description that seemingly runs counter to images of Red Cross officials standing alongside Hamas terrorists. 'It’s shameful that the Red Cross is enabling propaganda of terrorists after they took no action over the last year to even visit the hostages,' the source said. 'Congress needs to reassess the U.S. relationship and stop any funding for any groups that have aided and abetted Hamas atrocities.' An ICRC spokesman defended the committee's hostage release conduct—and placed Israel and Hamas on a level playing field when doing so. 'The ICRC has unequivocally stated that release operations be conducted safely, privately, and with the dignity of the individual at the forefront,' the spokesman said. 'We remain concerned about the conditions and manner that [sic] all steps of all the release operations are being conducted.' 'We have repeatedly reminded the parties that core principles of international humanitarian law always apply, including and especially during release operations,' he continued. 'Additionally, we do not endorse the actions of any groups or individuals we engage with.' The Red Cross is not the only aid agency to come under the congressional microscope, though it is one of the most prominent and well-funded. Lawmakers have expressed broader concerns about an international network of nonprofits operating in the Gaza Strip, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which has employed scores of Hamas terrorists and produced educational materials calling for 'jihad' and reference the Israeli 'occupation.' Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced legislation in the last Congress that would allow American terrorism victims to sue international organizations that support Hamas and other regional terror outfits. While the bill, dubbed the LIABLE Act, was primarily aimed at UNRWA and the World Health Organization, it is broadly written and could allow for other nonprofits like the Red Cross to be held accountable in court. 'The left-wing NGO ecosystem is deeply complicit in Hamas’s terrorism and torture of hostages,' Cruz told the Free Beacon. 'Bizarrely, these organizations enjoy more immunity from lawsuits than even sovereign countries.' The senator said he intends to reintroduce his bill in the current Congress, where it is likely to garner broad support from Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration, which has already slashed U.S. funding to UNRWA while eyeing further cuts. In Israel, there is also a growing consensus that the Red Cross—like UNRWA—must be held accountable for its participation in Hamas’s propaganda displays. Arsen Ostrovsky, a human rights lawyer and CEO of International Legal Forum, explained that the Red Cross is largely protected from legal action due to its status as an aid group. But President Donald Trump could issue an executive order stripping the agency of this privilege. Congress could also do so legislatively. 'Aiding and abetting Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, while abandoning the hostages, including American nationals, is not only not fully aligned with the foreign policy of the president of the United States, but runs entirely counter to it,' Ostrovsky told the Free Beacon. 'The United States should defund the ICRC and instead use that money to help the hostage families of those whom the ICRC has abandoned, including American nationals.' Republicans have similarly targeted the ICRC in the past. In 2005, the Senate Republican Policy Committee issued a report calling on then-president George W. Bush to pull funding for the committee, arguing that the Geneva-based group has worked to 'reinterpret and expand international law' in a way that benefited terror organizations like the Taliban.

Israeli drone strike in Lebanon kills Hezbollah terrorist	The incident comes a day after the deadline for a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory per the terms of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Jerusalem and Beirut that went into effect on Nov. 27. By JNS An Israeli drone strike on a vehicle in Ayta al-Shaab in Southern Lebanon on Wednesday killed an armed Hezbollah terrorist operative, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Wednesday afternoon. 'Earlier today, an Air Force aircraft operated to eliminate a threat and eliminated a Hezbollah military operative in the Ayta al-Shaab area in Southern Lebanon who was seen handling weapons,' the IDF stated. The Israeli army 'continues to act to remove any threat in accordance with the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,' it added. One person was reportedly killed in a drone strike by #Israel on a car in the south Lebanon town of Ayta ash-Shab. The Saudi al-Hadath outlet reports that he was a #Hezbollah member. pic.twitter.com/p9Ba84NBj2 &mdash; Jason Brodsky (@JasonMBrodsky) February 19, 2025 The incident comes a day after the deadline for a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory per the terms of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Jerusalem and Beirut that went into effect on Nov. 27. On Monday, the Israel Defense Forces Northern Command confirmed that troops would remain deployed at five strategic outposts in Southern Lebanon. The IDF will continue to act against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist group in Lebanon 'at full strength,' tweeted Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday morning. 'We will not allow a return to the reality of Oct. 7,' Katz declared, referring to the 2023 Hamas-led massacre in Israel’s south. 'Starting today, the IDF will remain in the buffer zone in Lebanon at five control posts along the border line, to ensure the protection of the northern communities,' he continued. Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster reported that the withdrawal from the rest of Southern Lebanon was completed ahead of the midnight deadline. IDF officials told the outlet overnight that 'the challenge is to preserve the [military] achievements and prevent Hezbollah from returning.' The IAF on Sunday evening conducted strikes on multiple Hezbollah sites in Lebanon housing rocket launchers and weapons, according to the Israeli military. An IAF strike in Southern Lebanon on Saturday night killed Hezbollah operative Abbas Ahmad Hamoud, who according to the Israeli military was responsible for overseeing the Iranian-backed terror group’s aerial force. Israel’s Army Radio reported on Monday that three instances of Hezbollah reconnaissance drones crossing into Israel in recent weeks were not disclosed to the public. According to the report, five surveillance drones were launched toward Israel from Lebanon, four of which managed to penetrate its airspace. However, only one UAV infiltration was publicly reported. According to the IDF, the other incidents were only confirmed to be real 'following an intelligence probe, and after about a week had passed.' 'The IDF reported every incident to the public when it was detected, in real time. The [security] systems identified dozens of incidents that turned out to be false,' the military told Army Radio. It was not immediately clear why the IDF did not report on the three successful drone infiltrations.

Hamas refuses disarmament, exile – but open to ceding Gaza	The terror group may see foregoing civilian governance as a different way to keep power. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told the Saudi Al Arabiya and Al Hadath channels earlier this week that 'Any future arrangement will be reached through national (Palestinian) consensus,' and that 'We do not cling to the rule of Gaza if that is in the interest of our people.' He then explained, 'There is no need for Hamas to be in Gaza's government in the future,' while adding, 'We have made concessions regarding the future of governance, but we have every right to remain part of the political landscape.' In the same report, Al Arabiya also cited a source 'familiar with the ceasefire negotiations' who added an important caveat to Hamas’ seeming willingness to forego power. The source said that Hamas renewed its commitment not to participate in the management of the Gaza Strip during the next phase, leaving wide open a future takeover of the coastal enclave. Pundits have also pointed out that it is possible that what lies behind Hamas outward flexibility is the realization that it would not necessarily be a bad thing to give up the civilian responsibilities of government, which includes providing its people with the basic necessities of life after a war that has devastated the Gaza Strip. It could then focus solely on rebuilding its military power and supplies over the coming years in order to continue trying to fulfill its charter and destroy Israel, without being distracted by the need to provide food, shelter, health care and the like to the civilian population. On Tuesday, Qassem doubled down, stating that Israel’s demand to force out the terror group from coastal enclave and keep the area permanently weapons-free was 'silly psychological warfare,' adding, 'The removal of the resistance from Gaza or its disarmament is unacceptable.' Egypt had reportedly put heavy pressure on Hamas to agree to relinquish control to the Palestinian Authority. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated an oft-stated mantra of his on the day after Qassem’s interview, saying that 'there will be neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority' ruling Gaza after the war ends. Instead, he was 'committed' to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan 'to create a different Gaza.' Israel’s government has enthusiastically backed Trump’s idea to have other countries absorb the Gazan population while the U.S. 'takes over' the coastal enclave and rebuilds it to become a Hamas-free 'Riviera of the Middle East.' Defense Minister Yisrael Katz ordered Monday the establishment of a new directorate within his ministry that will provide 'extensive assistance' to Palestinians who would like to emigrate from Gaza. While much of the Arab world and part of Europe has slammed the idea, insisting that the Gazans must stay put and enjoy no freedom of movement, a poll published by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research last June found that even before the war, almost a third (31%) of Gazans thought of emigrating, with the number rising to 44% among those of prime fighting age, 18-29. Most wanted to leave for economic motives, with 'political' reasons coming second, 'educational opportunities' third, and security and corruption rounding out the top five. It would seemingly be easy to predict that these numbers would only rise if the survey was retaken now, with perhaps only the order of the motives changing somewhat. The poll showed that the respondents’ preferred destinations were Turkey, Germany, Canada, the United States, and Qatar, in that order.

Israel conditioning continuation of ceasefire on removal of Hamas...	Israeli government reportedly conditioning implementation of second phase of Gaza deal on Hamas agreeing to disarm and leave Gaza Strip and exclusion of Palestinian Authority from involvement in post-war Gaza administration. By World Israel News Staff Israel is conditioning the implementation of the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal on Hamas’ willingness to disarm and to leave the Gaza Strip, according to a report by Channel 12. The report, broadcast on Tuesday night following a meeting of Israel’s security cabinet a day earlier, claimed that during the security cabinet’s deliberations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told ministers that Israel has a firm set of conditions heading into the latest around of talks in Doha, Qatar. The news comes as Netanyahu replaces the head of the Israeli negotiating team, swapping Mossad chief David Barnea with Strategic Affairs Minister and former Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer, a long-time Netanyahu loyalist. According to Tuesday night’s report, Netanyahu told cabinet ministers that in the upcoming Doha talks, Dermer will insist that Hamas disarm, and that the terrorist group withdraw from Gaza, with the movement’s leadership going into exile. A report by national broadcaster Kan echoed this claim, stating that Netanyahu has conditioned the implementation of the second phase of the hostage deal on the total demilitarization of the Gaza Strip. In addition, Channel 12 reported, Israel is demanding that a deal to implement phase two of the ceasefire include a provision excluding the Palestinian Authority from any role in the post-war management of the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar (New Hope) said Israel would 'not accept the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organization in Gaza.' However, Sa’ar continued, 'if we will see there is a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement then we will make this timeframe work longer.'

More than 50 NY rabbis implore Eric Adams and Kathy Hochul to opp...	The letter calls on the mayor and governor to 'restrict' illegal immigration raids in schools and houses of worship, which are now permitted under new federal guidelines. By Ben Sales, JTA More than 50 rabbis and cantors, including leaders of some of New York City’s most prominent synagogues, signed an open letter Tuesday asking Mayor Eric Adams and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to protect illegal immigrants from the Trump administration’s planned mass deportations. The letter, the latest in a succession of recent statements by Jewish leaders opposing President Donald Trump’s policies, comes at an unprecedentedly fraught time in the politics of New York City and the state. The Trump administration has moved to drop corruption charges against Adams so that he will be able to help the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigrants. The arrangement has led to a cascade of resignations at top levels of city government and beyond along with mounting calls for Adams to resign — which he has rebuffed. And relations between Hochul and Adams aren’t exactly tranquil. The evening before the rabbis’ letter was published, Hochul said she would be meeting with 'key leaders' to discuss taking the step of removing Adams from office, which no governor has ever done in the state’s history. Against that backdrop, the letter asks Adams and Hochul 'to be the leaders we desperately need at this moment, and do all you can to resist Trump’s terrifying anti-immigrant agenda.' It does not reference the controversy surrounding Adams. The letter calls on the mayor and governor to 'restrict' illegal immigration raids in schools and houses of worship, which are now permitted under new federal guidelines. It also calls on the leaders to refrain from sharing information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to not use jails to detain immigrants. 'We also know in our bones and from our modern history the danger of an unchecked xenophobic government scapegoating ‘outsiders’ to gain power, preying on a population experiencing hard economic times to gain support for a violent and destructive agenda,' the letter said. 'We will not stand by while history repeats itself. You, our state and local leaders, must not either.' The letter follows others signed by Jewish leaders or organizations opposing Trump’s or Republicans’ policies on transgender athletes, mass deportations, Gaza, and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. Jewish groups have also joined lawsuits challenging Trump’s immigration actions. The letters signatories hail from the Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist movements, and include leaders of large synagogues such as Temple Emanu-El, B’nai Jeshurun, Ansche Chesed, Congregation Beth Elohim, Forest Hills Jewish Center, Congregation Beit Simchat Torah, Society for the Advancement of Judaism and others. Not all rabbis who signed appended the names of their synagogues. The letter was organized by a consortium of progressive Jewish groups in the city, including Bend the Arc, the Jewish refugee aid group HIAS, Jews For Racial & Economic Justice, New York Jewish Agenda, the immigration advocacy group Never Again Action, the liberal rabbinic human rights group T’ruah and The Workers Circle.

A closer look at the six hostages to be released on Saturday	The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli officials confirmed that Hamas will release six hostages on Saturday as the terror group seeks to expedite the handovers of the ceasefire’s first phase. The captives expected to be freed are Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham Al-Sayed. Their return will come on the heels of the return of four bodies on Thursday. Here’s a look at the six living hostages Hamas said will be freed on Saturday. Two, both suffering from mental illness, have been held captive since entering Gaza on their own in 2014 and 2015. Avera Mengistu, now 37, entered Gaza on Sept. 17, 2014. Soldiers manning security cameras spotted Mengistu but failed to stop him before he managed to cross the fence and was caught by a Hamas patrol. An Ethiopian-Israeli who lived in Ashkelon, Mengistu suffers from schizophrenia and stopped taking his medicine around the time he disappeared. His last sign of life was in a propaganda video released by Hamas in 2023. According to the Hostage Families Forum, the Ethiopian-Israeli will have spent 3,821 days in captivity. Hisham al Sayed, now 37, was diagnosed with acute psychotic disorder and schizophrenia and suffered from auditory hallucinations. A resident of the Bedouin village of Hura, Sayed entered Gaza through the Erez Crossing on April 20, 2015. Sayed’s last sign of life was in a Hamas propaganda video in 2022 which showed him lying in a bed with an oxygen mask and IV drip. According to the Hostage Families Forum, Sayed will have spent 3,596 days in captivity. Elya Cohen, now 27, was abducted from the Nova Music Festival on the morning of October 7. Cohen and his fiance, Ziv Aboud, were shot while trying to flee the attack. Aboud said they were hiding in a shelter among dead bodies when terrorists lifted Cohen out and took him to Gaza. Other hostages freed in recent weeks told Cohen’s family they saw him chained and that he gets very little food or daylight. Tal Shoham, now 39, is a dual Israeli-Austrian national who was visiting family at Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7. He was taken captive along with his wife, Adi, their two daughters ages three and eight, and three other relatives, who were all freed during the temporary ceasefire of November 2023. Omer Wenkert, now 23, was abducted from the Nova Music Festival. Liam Or, who was released in November 2023, told the Wenkert family she was held captive together with Elya who she described as dangerously underweight. Wenkert suffers from colitis. Omer Shem-Tov, a computer programmer, now 22, was abducted from the Nova Music Festival. The last sign of life was in a Hamas video, but little else is known about his condition. The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how Israeli captives are alive. Hamas notified Israeli authorities in January that of the 33, eight are dead, but offered no evidence. Since the first hostage release on Jan. 19, Hamas has freed 19 Israeli and five Thai captives in exchange for 952 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists. The fate of the remaining 65 hostages will be determined by negotiations during the ceasefire’s second phase. Critics say the phased approach condemns these 65 hostages to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 73 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed to be dead.

Tech entrepreneur Palmer Luckey calls himself a ‘radical Zionist’...	Luckey also dismissed the 'slippery slope' argument that validating Israel’s existence could lead to a surge in the formation of ethno-states for other groups, calling such hypothetical scenarios 'absurd' reasons to oppose the Jewish state. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner Prominent tech entrepreneur Palmer Luckey referred to himself as a 'radical Zionist' while vigorously defending Israel’s right to existence during a new interview on the podcast the 'Shawn Ryan Show.' During the sit-down, Luckey reminisced about his 2017 firing from Facebook, allegedly over his support for US President Donald Trump. Luckey, founder of the defense tech company Anduril Industries, rejected the 'lockstep narrative' presented by the media that he is 'racist' or 'sexist,' pointing toward his strong support for Israel as an example of his support for minority groups. 'I’m actually a radical Zionist,' Luckey said. When asked by Ryan to elaborate on what he meant, Luckey explained that Jews have the right to maintain a state for their own self-defense. He argued that the Holocaust proved the need for a Jewish state, and without it Jews are at risk of facing violence. 'I strongly believe in the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. People are like, That’s so problematic, though. It’s so ethnostate adjacent.’ I said, ‘I don’t care,'' Luckey said. 'After what happened to them in World War II, they deserve a place where they can do their own thing and protect their own people without getting wrecked by everybody else who hates them.' Luckey also dismissed the 'slippery slope' argument that validating Israel’s existence could lead to a surge in the formation of ethno-states for other groups, calling such hypothetical scenarios 'absurd' reasons to oppose the Jewish state. He argued that it is 'very reasonable for the Jews to have their own state' and that the potential formation of a Palestinian state should be treated as 'a separate political issue.' Palmer Luckey explains what a radical zionist is.@PalmerLuckey pic.twitter.com/dv3PP3vhfr — Shawn Ryan Show (@ShawnRyanShow) February 16, 2025 All minority groups in Israel, including the Arabs who comprise about 20 percent of the Israeli population, enjoy the full and equal rights of the country’s democratic system, including the ability to serve in parliament and the judiciary. Meanwhile, Jews and other minority groups, including Christians among others, have faced intense discrimination in other parts of the Middle East. In the Palestinian-governed Judea and Samaria, for example, Palestinians are prohibited from selling land directly to Jewish Israelis. Luckey has stated his support for Israel several times. Following the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the tech entrepreneur lambasted prominent American individuals and institutions for not standing behind the Jewish state. 'Israel has my [and our] unqualified support,' Luckey said at the Wall Street Journal‘s Tech Live Conference in October of 2023. 'What’s happening in Israel is just another instance of the same type of evil that’s been going on for a very long time,' he added. 'And I think it reflects very poorly on our billionaire class that you’re not seeing a whole-of-country effort to become involved and to speak up about these issues, hedging on condemnation of Hamas for fear of saying the wrong thing, either in the court of public opinion or because it hurts their business interests.'

75% of Israeli Jews back Trump’s Gaza plan	Just 18% of Israeli Jews back Palestinian statehood, compared to 75% who oppose establishment of Palestinian state, even a demilitarized one. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The vast majority of Israeli Jews back President Donald Trump's plan to resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip abroad, according to a new poll. The survey was conducted by the Lazar Research Institute between February 11th and the 13th, with a sample size of 700 Israeli Jews and Arabs, ages 18 to 65. The poll was published Tuesday by the Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs. The study found little support for Palestinian statehood among Israel's Jewish population, with 75% of respondents saying they would not support establishing a Palestinian state - even a demilitarized on. Just 2% of Jewish Israelis said they would back Palestinian statehood without conditions, while 16% said they would support the establishment of a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes Israel as a Jewish state. Most Arab-Israelis, however, say they support Palestinian statehood along the pre-1967 lines, with just 16% opposing the establishment of such a state. Arab-Israelis were also more likely to say that Hamas should remain in the Gaza Strip as a 'civil body' after the current war with Israel. Just 4% of Jews agreed that Hamas should retain its civil administration role in Gaza, compared to 27% of Arab-Israelis. Nineteen percent of Arab-Israelis even say that Hamas should remain the 'ruling military body' in Gaza after the war, compared to 3% of Jews who held the same opinion. Two-thirds (66%) of Israeli Jews said the Palestinian Authority should not be given a role in the post-war governance of Gaza, while 44% of Arab-Israelis said it should be given a role. Three-quarters (75%) of Israeli Jews say they support Trump's plan to resettle all of Gaza's population in third-party countries, while 58% of Arab-Israelis oppose the proposal. Nearly three-quarters (71%) of the total Israeli population (Jewish and Arab) back the IDF establishing long-term buffer zones in southern Lebanon, Syria, and Gaza. Nearly two-thirds (61%) of all Israelis back military action against Iran's nuclear program. Of those, 38% say Israel should coordinate such an attack with the U.S., while 23% say Israel should carry out the attack unilaterally, without consulting the U.S. A total of 68% of Israeli Jews believe that a terrorist massacre, similar to those which took place in southwestern Israel on October 7th, 2023, could be carried out by Palestinian terrorists in Judea and Samaria. Just 25% of Arab-Israelis say they concerned about such a scenario.

Israeli authorities raid multiple UNRWA facilities in Jerusalem	Israel has said that UNRWA, the U.N. aid agency for Palestinians, has been so thoroughly penetrated by Hamas and other terrorist groups that it is essentially itself a terrorist enterprise. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, Canaan Lidor, JNS Jerusalem city inspectors accompanied by police entered several facilities on Tuesday in eastern Jerusalem of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), whose activity is illegal in Israel, according to laws that went into effect last month. Aryeh King, the deputy mayor of Jerusalem, said in a statement that for the first time since the establishment of the modern-day State of Israel, 'the Israeli government and the Jerusalem Municipality entered a compound owned by the KKL-Jewish National Fund, which UNRWA has been using without permission. Instead of serving as a Nazi base of operations, the 80-dunam [20 acre] complex will be used for Jerusalem Municipality facilities.' King was referring to UNRWA’s so-called Kalandia Training Center, Channel 14 reported, adding that it has been seized and that Border Police officers responded with crowd-dispersal means to rioting at the site during the raid. Additional raids occurred in the Nahal Ha-Egoz neighborhood and Kfar Hashiloach, the Hamas-affiliated Shehab News Agency reported. Another facility was raided in Kfar Akev, near the training center. A police spokesperson told JNS that the officers provided security for municipal inspectors and employees carrying out their missions. Israel has said that UNRWA, the U.N. aid agency for Palestinians, has been so thoroughly penetrated by Hamas and other terrorist groups that it is essentially itself a terrorist enterprise. UNRWA has denied this, but following the discovery of evidence linking dozens of UNRWA staff and facilities to the Hamas-led massacre of 1,200 people in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Knesset banned its activity in Israel and outlawed any contact between officials and UNRWA representatives. Authorities closed down two main offices of UNRWA in Jerusalem, prompting the group’s senior management to leave Israel, in addition to Judea and Samaria. Still, more than two weeks after the laws went into effect, UNRWA facilities were operational in eastern Jerusalem, Kan News reported on Monday. The reports led to criticism of a failure to enforce the laws, including by human-rights activist Shai Glick of the B’Tsalmo group, who threatened to show up at the illegally operating UNRWA facilities. The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has 'ordered the immediate implementation of the UNRWA law, which was passed in the Knesset with broad support. There are no restrictions on implementing the Prime Minister’s directive.' The cabinet minister responsible for Jerusalem, Meir Porush, said: 'I welcome the Prime Minister’s directive to immediately enforce the law to remove UNRWA from Jerusalem. There is no place for U.N. supporters of terrorism in our city.' His ministry, 'together with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and the Jerusalem Municipality, are prepared with all alternatives to the services provided by UNRWA in eastern Jerusalem.'

‘Days of heartbreak’: Israel prepares to receive fallen hostages	The forensic identification process will take several hours and include imaging scans, DNA sample analyses, and comparisons with existing medical records, such as dental X-rays. By Maytal Yasur Beit-Or, JNS On Thursday, Israel is set to enter a new and highly sensitive stage in the hostage release negotiations. For the first time since Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas is expected to return the bodies of hostages. The Israeli healthcare system and the National Center of Forensic Medicine are preparing to receive the fallen, while mental health organizations are gearing up to address the emotional impact on the families and the public. The Red Cross will take custody of the bodies from Hamas at a designated transfer point and hand them over to the Israel Defense Forces. They will then be airlifted to the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, where experts will conduct examinations to confirm identification and attempt to determine the cause and time of death. The forensic identification process will include imaging scans, DNA sample analyses and comparisons with existing medical records, such as dental X-rays. This process is expected to take several hours. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of many of the captives, has urged the public to refrain from spreading rumors and to avoid contacting the families regarding the matter. 'An emotional roller coaster' Throughout the war, the forensic institute has received the bodies of hostages recovered from Gaza during military operations. In the early months of the conflict, the IDF’s rabbinical unit operated a special identification center at the Shura military base. 'We are bracing for the heartbreak we know awaits us in the coming days. This period has been an emotional roller coaster,' said Dr. Shiri Daniels of the ERAN mental health support organization, which provides assistance via phone and online. 'We experience moments of relief alongside deep loss and mourning. This is a prolonged national trauma,' she added. Since the war began, ERAN has handled 437,856 calls and is preparing to expand its support lines. David Koren, ERAN’s CEO, warns of the emotional toll: 'We don’t know what we’re about to witness. This situation is drawing people from multiple circles of connection—direct and indirect—to seek mental health support. There is no precedent for an event of this scale.' Dr. Einat Yahna, head of rehabilitation at the Hostage and Missing Families Forum’s health division, explains that the release of hostages triggers intense reactions: 'For families whose loved ones are not on the release list, for families of the fallen hostages, and even for those who have already buried their loved ones, each development is another emotional upheaval. 'The hostages who returned alive brought signs of life [of other captives], which sparked both joy and anxiety among families still waiting for news. These families live in a constant state of uncertainty. On one hand, the signs of life provided a glimmer of hope, but on the other, they increased the anxiety level. Some families, whose loved ones have not been declared dead, are living in deep fear. We’ve learned that even the process of receiving tragic news is deeply unsettling and unclear, unlike the standard military protocol for handling loss.' Coping mechanisms The psychological impact may manifest in physical, emotional and cognitive symptoms, including difficulty concentrating, irritability, confusion, sleep disturbances, headaches and muscle tension. 'There’s no single right way to cope with loss and death,' said Daniels. 'On one hand, avoiding the subject entirely comes with emotional costs. On the other, it is important not to become consumed by grief.' Regarding children and teenagers, experts recommend discussing the situation with them before they encounter distressing footage. 'It’s crucial to provide age-appropriate information,' said Daniels. 'Tell them that difficult images and reports are expected and that they do not have to watch every video sent to them. Encourage them to express their thoughts and feelings, while avoiding dismissive comments that undermine their fear or sadness.' Dr. Yahna concluded: 'The coming days will be incredibly difficult. We must rise above the immediate pain and understand that this is a necessary step toward closing the collective trauma of the hostage crisis. Only certainty can help move from paralysis to healing.'

Hamas offers to release all remaining hostages in single swap	Hamas officials pushing for a comprehensive, all-or-nothing approach to talks for the implementation of the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire, offering to release all remaining Israeli hostages in one shot - while demanding an end to the war a full IDF withdrawal. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization has offered to release all remaining Israeli hostages - both dead and alive - together in a single large exchange, a senior spokesman for the terror group announced Tuesday night. Khalil al-Hayya, the acting chairman of Hamas' politburo, announced Tuesday that the terror group is slated to return 10 Israeli hostages, including 6 living captives and the remains of four dead hostages, this week, in two exchanges. The first, set for Thursday, will include the four dead captives, while the second, including the six living captives, is slated for Saturday. Al-Hayya said the move demonstrated Hamas' commitment to the hostage deal and the group's willingness to move forward with the implementation of the second phase of the deal. 'We highlight the need of the occupation to implement all instructions of the deal without delay,' al-Hayya said. The Hamas leader added that in order to move forward with the return of the remains of dead hostages, his group would need bulldozers and other heavy equipment to remove debris in the war-torn Gaza Strip. 'We demand that heavy equipment to extract bodies including of hostages who were killed in Israeli bombing,' al-Hayya said. Al-Hayya called for a comprehensive deal between Hamas and Israel to end the war in Gaza permanently, return the remaining Israeli hostages, and remove Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. 'We are prepared to immediately move to the next phase that includes a complete cease-fire and withdrawal of the military.' A second senior Hamas official, Hazem Qassem, echoed al-Hayya's comments, saying Tuesday night that in the second phase of the deal, Hamas would release remaining hostages in a single exchange - on condition that Israel agrees to pull out of Gaza. Qassem added that Hamas would not agree to leave Gaza or to disarm, though it does not rule out ceding control to another Palestinian entity.

Gaza terrorist who held Israelis captive to be released in hostag...	Details regarding the identities of the terrorists slated for release under the hostage deal reportedly concealed from ministers. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Cabinet ministers were not informed of certain details of the Palestinian prisoner release to be effected this week in exchange for four bodies and six live hostages, i24 News reported Tuesday. The agreement with Hamas that the Cabinet approved stated that no one would be freed who were involved in the terrorists’ slaughter of 1,200 and abduction of 251 people during their invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023. Those who fought against the IDF over the 15 months of war in Gaza were also ruled out. However, reporter Avishai Grinzaig said that among the 1,000 security prisoners who will be freed, which includes all females and those up to age 19 arrested by IDF forces in Gaza since October 7, is also a woman known to have held hostages captive. Others include those who have launched rockets in previous rounds of fighting with Israel, were involved in digging terror tunnels, and Hamas members and officials whom Israel has not proven to have taken part in the current war. Out of the 1,000 detainees, Hamas selected 500 names and Israel selected the other 500 to be released. Grinzaig said that a minister had claimed to him that 'These details were not clearly presented in the Cabinet meeting,' and that they didn’t know about it. According to Israel National News, Hamas was not given a completely free choice about who could be released. Israeli officials gave the terrorist organization a list of names that had already been previously approved by the government, the media outlet said. The January agreement had reportedly stated that a list of 400 Palestinians arrested since October 7 would be forwarded every Sunday to Hamas during the first phase. This included 250-300 terrorists who are serving life sentences for the murder of many Israelis, and hundreds more who were sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for their roles in committing terror attacks. Hamas has announced that three of the four murdered hostages to be released Thursday are Shiri Bibas and her two young children, Ariel and Kfir, who were four and nine months old when the terrorists dragged them into Gaza from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The father of the family, Yarden, was released from Hamas captivity on February 1. Hamas did not publicly name the fourth body. Israeli officials have said that positive identification will made by forensic specialists on all the bodies before the affected families are officially informed, and only then will the information be made public.

Hostages held for over a decade slated to come home Saturday	Avera Mengistu, 38, and Hisham al-Sayyed, 37, to be released on Saturday, alongside four other Israeli captives. By World Israel News Staff Two Israeli hostages held in captivity by the Hamas terror group for more than ten years are expected to be released in the coming days, alongside an additional four Israelis kidnapped on October 7th. The Israeli government officially confirmed that Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayyed are slated for release this Saturday. Both Mengistu, now 38, and al-Sayyed, now 37, suffer from mental health issues, and entered the Strip of their own accord in two separate incidents in 2014 and 2015. Mengistu's 'parents, brothers, and sisters will travel to greet him,' a relative, Gil Elias, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'This is joyful and surprising news that we have been waiting for for more than 10 years,' Elias added. 'We are eagerly waiting for him to arrive, I want to see him walk out of there on his own two feet, with a smile,' he said. In a media statement, al-Sayyed's family said that while they are thrilled about his upcoming release, they empathize with the families of the hostages who will not be returned during this phase of the deal. 'Our Hisham will return home&#8230;but the good news about his expected return will not be complete until all the abductees return to their homes,' the family said. 'The ceasefire and hostage deal agreement must not be allowed to fail, and the fate of additional abductees must not be a decade in captivity.' Al-Sayyed, a Bedouin-Israel, briefly served in the Israeli army, but was discharged due to his mental health issues. His father, also named Hisham, told Ynet that he had reached out to the families of those kidnapped on October 7th, as he understands their anguish. 'I visit some of the families, we try to be in touch with all of them,' he said. 'They are from all sides of the political spectrums. We are in touch with families and not aligned with any political platform or movement.'

UN official demands Israel, US pay reparations to Gaza	United Nations special rapporteur Francesca Albanese demands Israel and the United States prepare to pay reparations to Gaza, claiming both are liable under international law. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior United Nations official is demanding the United States and Israel pay war reparations to the Gaza Strip and to the Palestinian Authority, claiming both countries are liable under international law. On Sunday, United Nations Special Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories Francesca Albanese posted on her X/Twitter account that Israel's war against the Hamas terror organization in Gaza and its counter-terror operations in Judea and Samaria constitute a 'genocidal assault' against Palestinian Arabs. Furthermore, she argued, Israel is liable for war reparations to Gaza and the Palestinian people at large. The United States, too, must 'make plans to offer reparations' due to its role in arming the Israeli military. 'It is about time that Israel and the US - and those who enabled and armed the genocidal assault against the Palestinians - make plans to offer REPARATIONS to the Palestinian people to rebuild Gaza, as prescribed by international law,' Albanese wrote. The Italian human rights attorney also lambasted President Donald Trump's plan to resettle the population of Gaza abroad and to place the enclave under American control. 'HOW to rebuild Gaza, much of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, is up to the Palestinians. PS. Riviera plan does not count as reparation; rather as a rapacious attempt to continue to commit crimes in Palestine.' Since her tenure as Special Rapporteur began in 2022, Albanese has repeatedly become embroiled in controversies over her comments on Israel, on Jews and the 'Jewish lobby,' and strong support for the Palestinian cause and refusal to condemn deadly attacks on Israelis. According to a report last month by the Jewish Insider, Albanese's behavior has even drawn criticism from within the United Nations' leadership, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres privately telling American Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism Deborah Lipstadt that Albanese is a 'horrible person.' Guterres reportedly used that phrase twice to describe Albanese during his talk with Lipstadt at a Munich Security Conference. In the past, Albanese has compared Israelis to Nazis, claimed the 'Jewish lobby' has subjugated the United States, and justified Hamas invasion and massacres of October 7th, 2023, saying the Israeli victims were 'not killed because of their Judaism but in response to Israel's oppression.'

Iran threatens fresh missile attack on Israel ‘in due time’	IRGC deputy commander-in-chief says Iran will attack Israel with ballistic missiles for a third time, in the near future. By World Israel News Staff A senior Iranian military official pledged a third round of ballistic missile strikes on Israel, saying that the attack would occur in the near future. Deputy IRGC commander-in-chief Brigadier General Ali Fadavi said while speaking at a conference on Monday that 'True Promise III will be carried out in due time.' Fadavi claimed that Israel had suffered a crushing defeat in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which was launched following the October 7th massacre. 'Zionist regime officials themselves admit that Hamas won and they lost,' Fadavi said. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that after battling Iranian proxy groups, including Hezbollah, Jerusalem 'can and will finish the job' fighting Iran's 'axis of terror.' In response, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei sniped that Israel 'cannot do a damn thing' to seriously damage Iran. The exchange came on the heels of reports that Israel is planning a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities later this year. After a massive weapons shipment from the U.S. was delivered to Israel, which was previously held up by the Biden administration, speculation has grown that an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear assets is imminent. 'If the Zionist entity attacks our nuclear facilities, we will respond in kind. I do not believe they would take such a reckless step, as they know well how we would react,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Arabic-language outlet Al Mayadeen . In November, shortly after Israel destroyed critical air defense systems following Iran's second attack on Israel, 'Responding to the Zionist entity’s attack is inevitable and certain,' Araghchi said to the outlet at the time. 'However, the circumstances, timing, and form of this response will be determined based on the appropriate conditions.'

Jewish groups urge Knesset to press UN on Hamas sexual crimes	The UN has yet to list Hamas as a party accused of committing rape in armed conflict or hold the terrorist organization accountable for these crimes against humanity. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A delegation of Jewish groups urged the Knesset to pressure the UN to hold Hamas accountable for its sexual crimes committed since October 7th, 2023. The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations addressed a special Knesset session on Monday. Carol Ann Schwartz, National President of World Hadassah, highlighted the global effort to seek justice for victims of Hamas's sexual violence. 'We were outraged by Hamas’ brutal October 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the reports of widespread weaponization of sexual violence,' she said. 'Over the past year, the war has deeply affected women in personal ways. We met with UN leaders and mobilized over 150,000 grassroots signatures from nearly 120 countries, in addition to collaborating with 120 organizations, to demand that the United Nations take action and hold Hamas accountable.' She continued, 'The UN has yet to list Hamas as a party accused of committing rape in armed conflict or hold the terrorist organization accountable for these crimes against humanity. We will not give up. Sexual violence in conflict is increasing worldwide, and accountability is crucial to preventing future atrocities.' Meredith Jacobs, CEO of Jewish Women International and Co-Founder, spoke about the profound impact sexual violence has on women and how Israelis and Jewish women are being excluded from the conversation, especially on college campuses. 'The effects of dehumanization, objectification, and hate are playing out on our campuses and beyond. Jewish survivors of sexual violence no longer feel safe seeking help from mainstream agencies,' she said. 'Those of us in the field have lost colleagues, and women’s studies programs at universities across the United States are teaching that Israel is weaponizing feminism and that Zionists are not to be trusted.' Sheila Katz, CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women, emphasized the urgency of breaking the silence surrounding Hamas’ crimes: 'Rape is a violation of humanity. It must never be normalized—not in our cities, not on our campuses, and not as a weapon of war. But silence, in itself, normalizes rape.'

Sa’ar: Israel to start Phase 2 talks with Hamas	As part of Phase 2, Jerusalem will reportedly demand the release of all hostages in addition to the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza and the dismantling of its terrorist army. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told reporters on Tuesday that Jerusalem decided to start talks on Phase 2 of the ongoing hostage release and ceasefire agreement with Hamas. 'We had a Security Cabinet meeting last night. We decided to open negotiations on the second phase,' Jerusalem’s top diplomat said during a briefing for journalists at the Foreign Ministry. As part of the talks set to begin later this week, the Israeli government will demand the complete disarmament of Iranian-backed Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist organizations in Gaza, the minister stressed. A 'Hezbollah model' in which Hamas retains its 'military' capabilities is unacceptable for Israel, 'and therefore we need a total demilitarization of Gaza and no presence of the Palestinian Authority,' stated Sa’ar. Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha earlier on Tuesday that 'there is a positive atmosphere regarding the second phase of the agreement.' He added, 'The arrival of the delegations depends on the decisions of the parties involved.' Jerusalem’s negotiating teams in Egypt and Qatar have so far focused only on the implementation of the current Phase 1 of the Gaza truce. An Israeli political source cited by Ynet on Tuesday said that Jerusalem was making 'great efforts to release all six remaining living hostages in the first phase, as well as four hostages who are no longer alive.' Hebrew media reported on Monday that Israel this week is seeking the freedom of six instead of three living hostages during the upcoming seventh release. Under the terms of the deal, Hamas is also expected to release on Thursday the bodies of four captives murdered in Gaza. In exchange for releasing the three additional living hostages, the Israeli government has reportedly signaled its willingness to allow the entry of hundreds of additional caravans for the reconstruction of the Strip. The Israeli official told Ynet on Tuesday, 'In the outline for the release of the hostages, Israel has committed to bringing caravans and mechanical engineering equipment into the Gaza Strip following strict inspection. As part of the negotiations, and subject to Hamas’s compliance with the deal, Israel will begin to allow this in a controlled and gradual manner.' The first 42-day phase of the deal with Hamas is set to end on March 1. On Monday, the Security Cabinet met to formulate 'instructions for the continuation of the negotiations regarding the second stage,' according to an official statement from the Prime Minister’s Office. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is working in 'full cooperation and coordination' with the U.S. administration on the next phase of the ceasefire, he emphasized during a joint press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem on Sunday. 'We have a shared strategy, which cannot always be detailed to the public—including when the gates of hell will open. And they will open if all our hostages are not returned, every last one of them,' he stressed. Netanyahu’s remark was a reference to Trump’s warning that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed if Hamas does not release all of the hostages. As part of Phase 2, Jerusalem will reportedly demand the release of all hostages in addition to the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza and the dismantling of its terrorist army. Officials in Jerusalem believe that the terror organization is likely to reject the demands. U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News on Sunday that second-phase talks would take place this week 'at a location to be determined.' Witkoff noted he already had 'very productive and constructive' talks on Sunday with Netanyahu, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and the head of Egypt’s General Intelligence. He said they spoke about 'the sequencing of Phase 2, setting forth positions on both sides, so we can understand … where we are today, and then continuing talks this week at a location to be determined so that we can figure out how we get to the end of Phase 2 successfully.'

Released Palestinian terrorist leaves prison with $633,000	The Palestinian Authority (PA) allocates around $279 million annually to pay salaries to security prisoners in Israeli prisons, which range from $400-$3,400 per month, depending on the sentence. By Anna Epshtein, TPS Ahmed Barghouti, who masterminded suicide bombing attacks which killed twelve Israelis, walked out of an Israeli prison on Saturday afternoon with more than 1.2 million shekels ($338,00) in his bank account, courtesy Palestinian Authority stipends that Israelis refer to as 'pay for slay.' Similar sums awaited Mansour Shreim and Ahmed Abu Khader. The latter was member of the Palestinian Authority security forces who trained terrorists for suicide missions and carried out shooting attacks. Shreim dispatched terrorists who killed nine Israeli teenagers in separate attacks in 2002. 'The Palestinian Authority pays salaries to the terrorists while they are in Israeli prisons. It is not to support their families – it is actually to reward them for what they did,' Itamar Marcus, head of Palestinian Media Watch, told The Press Service of Israel. 'The money is accumulated in the private account of the given terrorist, that is being opened for him immediately after he enters a prison.' The Palestinian Authority (PA) allocates around $279 million annually to pay salaries to security prisoners in Israeli prisons, which range from $400-$3,400 per month, depending on the sentence. For comparison, PA welfare benefits to ordinary Palestinians range from $60-$170 per month depending on need. Those who participated in terror attacks killing Israelis — thus receiving the most severe sentences — got the highest payouts. The Palestinian Authority allocates seven percent of its annual budget for its so-called 'Martyr’s Fund,' which provides stipends to Palestinian terrorists in Israeli prisons, and the families of terrorists killed in attacks. Israeli officials say the stipends provide incentives for terror and regularly offset an equivalent amount from taxes that Israel collects on behalf of the PA. According to Palestinian Media Watch, the total amount of money that awaits the terrorists released as part of the current ceasefire deal with Hamas is around $142 million. Most enriched by the terror stipends is Muhammed Tus, who was released on Jan. 25 and deported to a third country via Egypt. According to PMW, Tus, who served 40 years for several terror attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians, has amassed $633,000. The runner-up is Raad Saadi, who served 36 years for killing Israeli soldiers and was deported. His bank account now has $571,000 courtesy the PA. PA President Mahmoud Abbas signed a decree on Feb. 10 that appeared to end the payments, but Marcus called the move a pretense to please the US. 'They moved the funds to another bank account, the same that pays welfare benefits, because they need the US money,' Marcus told TPS-IL. 'But several PA sources say the salaries to the terrorists will remain very high, identical to what they were. We will only know this in March, once the payments are made.' The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how Israeli captives are alive. Since the first hostage release of Jan. 19, Hamas has freed 19 Israeli and five Thai captives in exchange for 952 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists. Hamas is due to return the bodies of four dead hostages on Thursday and free six live captives on Saturday. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 73 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed to be dead.

Hamas official says bodies of Bibas family will return to Israel ...	Kfir and Ariel’s father, Shiri’s husband Yarden, was also taken hostage and held separately. By Ben Sales, JTA This is a developing story. A Hamas official has announced that the terror group will return the bodies of four Israeli hostages on Thursday, among them the Bibas family. Hamas is also due to release six living hostages on Saturday. The return of the bodies of Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas would mark a tragic end to 16 months of activism, protest and prayer on behalf of the family, who more than anyone else became symbols of the Israeli hostages’ plight. Kfir and Ariel’s father, Shiri’s husband Yarden, was also taken hostage and held separately. He was released earlier this month. An image of Shiri clutching the two boys, then ages 9 months and 4, as they were abducted into Gaza circulated widely after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Since then, their names and pictures, identifiable by the boys’ red hair, have been at the center of global efforts to secure the hostages’ release, have symbolized the atrocities of Oct. 7 and have animated the prayers and hopes of Jews and other advocates worldwide. Images of the family in happier times have spread worldwide. Since a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, Kfir and Ariel Bibas have been the only two children held hostage in Gaza. Hamas claimed in November 2023 that Shiri and the two boys had been killed, and Israel said it was investigating the claim but did not confirm it. In the year-plus since, advocates for the hostages have held out hope that the family remained alive. In recent weeks, Israel has broadcast increasing worry about Shiri, Kfir and Ariel, who are on the list of hostages to be released during the current ceasefire. An Israeli official expressed 'grave concerns' for their fate. Concerns rose further after Hamas announced that eight of the 33 hostages due to be released during the first phase of the ceasefire were dead. On Tuesday, in a prerecorded video, Hamas official Khalil Al-Hayya announced the release of the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, 'among them the bodies of the Bibas family.' CNN and the Associated Press also reported that Hamas announced the return of the bodies of the Bibas family. In response, relatives of the Bibases said in a statement that they had not received confirmation of Shiri, Kfir and Ariel’s fate, and asked for privacy. 'In the past few hours, we have been in turmoil following Hamas spokesperson’s announcement about the planned return of our Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir this Thursday as part of the hostages’ remains release phase,' said the statement, made via the Hostages and Families Forum. 'We want to make it clear that while we are aware of these reports, we have not yet received any official confirmation regarding this matter. Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over.' The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that four dead hostages would be released on Thursday followed by six living hostages on Saturday. The bodies of the final four hostages included in the first phase of the agreement will be released the following week. The announcement did not include the hostages’ names. 'Understandings have been reached in the Cairo negotiations according to which six living first-stage hostages will be released on Saturday,' the statement said. 'This Thursday, four deceased hostages will be returned to Israel. Pursuant to the agreement, four additional deceased hostages are due to be returned to Israel next week.'

Hamas to release six living hostages on Saturday	In addition, the remains of four hostages killed in Hamas captivity will be handed over to Israel on Thursday. By JNS The Hamas terrorist group agreed to double the number of hostages scheduled to be freed as part of the seventh release on Saturday to six, the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem announced on Tuesday. In addition, the bodies of four hostages murdered in Hamas captivity will be handed over on Thursday, in line with the ceasefire deal, which stipulates that the remains will be returned on the 33rd day of the truce. 'In accordance with the agreement, four additional slain hostages are expected to be handed over to Israel next week,' the PMO added. A political source cited by Ynet earlier on Tuesday said that Jerusalem was making 'great efforts to release all six remaining living hostages in the first phase, as well as four hostages who are no longer alive.' In exchange for releasing the three additional living hostages, the Israeli government has reportedly signaled its willingness to allow the entry of hundreds of additional caravans for the reconstruction of the Strip. The Israeli official told Ynet on Tuesday, 'In the outline for the release of the hostages, Israel has committed to bringing caravans and mechanical engineering equipment into the Gaza Strip following strict inspection. As part of the negotiations, and subject to Hamas’s compliance with the deal, Israel will begin to allow this in a controlled and gradual manner.' According to official estimates, a total of 73 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after 500-plus days, including 70 abducted during the Hamas-led cross-border terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023. This figure includes the remains of at least 35 hostages, confirmed dead by Israeli authorities. Hamas is reportedly scheduled to hand over the names of the first slain captives slated for release on Thursday morning. Military ambulances will collect the bodies at a Gaza meeting point, from where they will be brought to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. Israeli officials involved in the preparations have said that the families will only be informed after the full identification process is completed.

Egypt pushing plan to keep Gazans in Gaza – report	Cairo drafts alternative to Trump's Gaza resettlement plan, with the aim of rebuilding the Strip without relocating the area's roughly 2 million residents abroad. By World Israel News Staff Egypt is drafting an alternative plan for the future of the Gaza Strip, an Egyptian state media outlet has reported, hoping to replace President Donald Trump's proposal to resettle the entire population of Gaza abroad. The Al-Ahram newspaper, a mouthpiece of the Cairo government, reported that the Egyptian government is working to put together a comprehensive plan under which the roughly two million Gazans living in the Gaza Strip would remain in the coastal enclave during the reconstruction of the war-torn area. Under the plan, Gazans would be temporarily resettled internally within the Gaza Strip in 'secure areas,' while debris is cleared out of the Strip and towns and infrastructure rebuilt by Egyptian and foreign companies. Senior Egyptian officials have begun discussing the plan, which is still in development, with officials from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and a number of European states. A non-partisan Palestinian Arab body, separate from both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority government in Ramallah, would be tasked under the plan with administering the Strip, while a new police force made up of former PA police would provide security - with the help of additional security personnel trained by Western advisers. Egypt hopes to 'refute American President Trump's logic,' the report said. On February 4th, Trump announced his plans to resettle Gaza's population in third-party countries, including Egypt and Jordan, with reports suggesting the U.S. is also considering Indonesia, Albania, and several territories in northern and eastern Africa. Both Egypt and Jordan rejected the plan publicly, with Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, reportedly snubbing Trump, refusing to attend a planned White House meeting in protest of the resettlement plan.

Israeli lawmaker compares Trump’s Gaza plan to Holocaust	Arab party’s sole Jewish MK, already suspended from the Knesset, now faces new ethics board complaint after comparing plan to encourage voluntary mass migration of Gazans to the Holocaust. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli lawmaker sparked controversy Tuesday morning when he compared President Donald Trump’s plan to resettle the entire population of Gaza abroad – and Israel’s efforts to facilitate the implementation of the plan – to the ethnic cleansing of Jews in Austria under the Nazi regime. In a post to his X account, MK Ofer Cassif – a former Hebrew University lecturer now serving as the sole Jewish member in the Hadash-Ta’al party – published a photograph from 1938 showing Austrian Jews lined up outside of the Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna. 'Eighty-six years ago this month, the ‘Central Office for Jewish Emigration’ was established in Berlin with the aim of encouraging voluntary emigration of Jews from Germany,' Cassif wrote, apparently drawing from a text published last summer marking the anniversary of the opening of the Central Office. The Central Office for Jewish Emigration was established by senior SS officer Adolf Eichmann, one of the architects of the Holocaust and the sole Nazi official to be tried and executed in the State of Israel for his role in the genocide of European Jewry. First established in Vienna in August 1938, the Central Office for Jewish Emigration was created months after the Anschluss unified Austria and Germany, bringing Vienna under Nazi rule. Cassif, who is already serving a six-month suspension from the Knesset after signing onto a petition accusing Israel of genocide in the Gaza Strip and calling for an international investigation of the Jewish state, could now face a second suspension after a fellow MK submitted a complaint with the Knesset's ethics committee. MK Amog Cohen (Otzma Yehudit) announced via X Tuesday that he had filed the complaint, calling Cassif a 'traitor.' 'I have just submitted a complaint to the Knesset Ethics Committee against the terrorist supporter Ofer Cassif for his despicable and disgraceful comparison of the voluntary migration plan for Gaza residents to the voluntary migration of Jews from Nazi Germany,' Cohen wrote. 'I sincerely hope that he will once again be severely punished and have his salary revoked. This traitor is unworthy of being in the Israeli Knesset and certainly not of representing the public. He represents the interests of Hamas and BDS movements and serves as a fifth column among us.'

Israel forms new directorate to help Gazans emigrate	The office will provide 'extensive assistance' in an attempt to implement U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Defense Minister Yisrael Katz decided Monday to establish a new directorate within his ministry to aid Palestinians who would like to leave the Gaza Strip, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal last week to resettle them elsewhere so that the Gaza Strip can be rebuilt without Hamas involvement. The ministry’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) outlined a plan for the directorate to implement, which, the ministry said, 'includes extensive assistance that will allow any Gaza resident who wants to emigrate to a third state, to receive support that includes special departure arrangements through the sea, air, and land, among other things.' The new body is expected to include representatives from several government ministries and defense establishment bodies, with the aim of providing a comprehensive framework for the process. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that he is 'committed to U.S. President Trump's plan to create a different Gaza.' He told a conference of the American umbrella group, Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, Monday night that Trump’s 'bold new vision' was 'the only plan that I think can work to enable a different future for the people of Gaza, for the people of Israel, for the surrounding areas.' 'Why not give the people of Gaza a choice? Everyone said it was the largest open-air prison in the world? It's not because of us,' he continued in his address. 'We allow people to leave. In fact, over the last two years, I think, 150,000 Gazans have left.' 'They left because they bribed their way out,' he noted. 'It wasn't via us&#8230;. The rich could leave. But if other people want to leave, give them the choice. Not forced deportation, not ethnic cleansing. In wars, people leave.' MK Ofer Cassif, the only Jewish member of the communist Hadash party, created a political storm when he reacted on X by comparing the ministry’s initiative to Nazi Germany’s establishment of an office to encourage the voluntary emigration of German Jews before World War II began. Israel Beiteinu MK Oded Forer said Cassif’s 'comparison between the voluntary departure of Gaza residents, fleeing the terror of Hamas, which condemned them to a life under a reign of terror, blood, and fire, and the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany, is not only a vicious lie, it is a despicable blood libel.' Cassif cannot be confused with facts,' he continued. 'His fondness for using the symbols of the Third Reich is rivaled only by his insane obsession with harming the State of Israel and serving the enemy's propaganda. I ask for the millionth time, is this an MK or an official Hamas spokesman? One thing is certain, he should not sit in the Israeli Knesset.' After Cassif announced last January that he would join South Africa’s petition against Israel in the International Criminal Court, Forer tried to get the requisite 90 MKs to vote on removing Cassif, but was stymied by several parliamentarians in Yesh Atid and National Unity joining Arab MKs in blocking the move. MK Almog Cohen (Otzma Yehudit) said that he would complain to the Ethics Committee and also restart the process to expel Cassif from the Knesset. His party simultaneously announced that it will submit a bill to lower the majority required to remove a Knesset member to only 80 supporters, which is still 'a significant majority that expresses the support of two thirds of the Knesset members, but is not too high to be feasible.'

British motorbiking couple detained in Iran	The couple’s last public appearance was a YouTube video filmed in the historical city of Yazd on January 3rd. They were due to reach Pakistan by January 4th, but never checked into their hotel in Kerman. By Jewish Breaking News Just days before their disappearance, British couple Craig and Lindsay Foreman wrote about their belief that 'most humans are good, kind people wanting to live a good life.' Now, the 51-year-old carpenter and his 52-year-old psychologist wife find themselves detained in Iran’s notorious prison system. Combining their love for motorcycle travel with academic curiosity, the Foremans’ were on a global expedition to explore different cultures’ perspectives on living a 'good life.' However, their pursuit of happiness would take a wrong turn when they entered Iran from Armenia around December 30, the Telegraph reports. Despite the UK government’s warnings against travel to the region, the Foremans’ remained optimistic. 'The UK government advises against all but essential travel to these areas, and the news paints a pretty grim picture,' they wrote on Facebook as they began their adventure into the Islamic Republic. 'But here’s the thing: overlanders and travelers who’ve ventured through these regions speak of nothing but warm hospitality, incredible landscapes, and memories that last a lifetime.' Their early experiences seemed to confirm this hope. Accompanied by a tour guide, they visited the country’s ancient cities of Tabriz, Tehran, and Isfahan. On January 2nd, Lindsay shared what would become her final Instagram post. 'Travel has a way of reminding you of what really matters,' she wrote. 'On this journey around the world, we’ve felt a deep sense of connection – and nowhere more so than here in Iran.' The couple’s last public appearance was a YouTube video filmed in the historical city of Yazd on January 3rd. They were due to reach Pakistan by January 4th, but never checked into their hotel in Kerman. On Thursday, Iranian state-run media outlets revealed their detention. However, the Foremans’ arrest had little to do with any actual wrongdoing. 'They weren’t arrested for committing a crime – they’re British citizens and that alone is enough to justify their detention and then phone England and ask for something,' an Iranian government source tells the Telegraph. The Foremans’ are reportedly being held in Kerman, a decision that the source suggests may be intended to limit information leaks and keep negotiations away from the capital. British Ambassador Hugo Shorter has managed to meet with the couple at the Kerman Public Prosecutor’s office, though Iranian state media has only released photos with the couples faces blurred. Credit: IRNA Speaking through the UK’s Foreign Office, the family has expressed 'significant concern' over Craig and Lindsay’s wellbeing. 'This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and well-being during this trying time. We truly appreciate the outpouring of support from friends, family, and the community, which has provided us with strength and encouragement as we face this ordeal.'

Anti-Israel students at Bowdoin College to protest suspensions ov...	Bowdoin College has previously said that it will not tolerate unlawful occupations of its buildings. By Dion J. Pierre, The Algemeiner Bowdoin College’s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter will hold on Tuesday a mass rally to protest disciplinary charges brought against an estimated 50 student-members who received interim suspensions and other sanctions for illegally occupying an administrative building earlier this month. As previously reported by The Algemeiner, SJP installed an encampment inside Smith Union to demand a boycott of Israel and signal its opposition to US President Donald Trump’s proposal that Gazans who were displaced by the Israel-Hamas war be resettled elsewhere while the Palestinian enclave is transformed into a hub for tourism and job creation. Bowdoin, moving quickly to quell the disruption, persuaded its students to abandon the effort after just four days by levying interim suspensions on several dozen of them and notifying their families. The consequences so far have stuck, SJP decried in a statement which alleged that some students are now ineligible to dwell in their dormitories and attend class. This week, the group continued, eight of them will participate in hearings that will determine whether they receive full suspensions. SJP is calling for them to be amnestied and restored to good standing. 'Our peers who bravely remained in the encampment have been evicted from campus, unable to attend class (virtually or in person), and are now being subject to a flawed and non-transparent disciplinary process, all for continuing Bowdoin’s long history of student activism,' SJP posted on Instagram on Sunday. 'We will not be silent as our friends face retaliation for standing against a genocide.' It continued, 'Walk out of class with us at 4:30 pm on Tuesday, Feb. 18 and join us for a rally outside Moulton Union to demand amnesty for the Bowdoin Eight.' Bowdoin College has previously said that it will not tolerate unlawful occupations of its buildings. 'We heard from some members of the our community that these events have left them feeling vulnerable,' college president Safa Zaki said in a statement to the campus community, explaining that SJP transgressed 'policies governing building use and student behavior.' She continued, 'These rules are not symbolic. They are designed to ensure that members of the community can feel welcome and safe in every space on campus and have fair access to those spaces.' The college — located in Brunswick, Maine and once the subject of a landmark study which accused it of promoting the excesses of left-wing ideology — is not the only higher education institution that has been convulsed by anti-Israel activity this semester. Columbia University was a victim of infrastructural sabotage last month, when an extremist anti-Zionist group flooded the toilets of an academic building with concrete to mark the anniversary of an alleged killing of a Palestinian child. The targeted facilities were located on several floors of the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA), according to Keren Yarhi-Milo, dean of the school, who addressed the matter, calling the behavior 'deplorable, disruptive, and deeply unsettling, as our campus is a space we cherish for learning teaching, and working, and it will not be tolerated.' Numerous reports indicate the attack may have been the premeditated result of planning sessions which took place many months ago at an event held by Alpha Delta Phi (ADP) — a literary society, according to the Washington Free Beacon. During the event, the Free Beacon reported, ADP distributed literature dedicated to 'aspiring revolutionaries' who wish to commit seditious acts. Additionally, a presentation was given in which complete instructions for the exact kind of attack which struck Columbia were shared with students. In a separate incident on Feb. 5, roughly 50 members of the Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, along with the group Graduate Students for Justice in Palestine, at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) amassed on the property of UC Regent Jay Sures and threatened that he must 'divest now or pay.' As part of the demonstration, the students imprinted their hands, which had been submerged in red paint to symbolize the spilling of blood, all over Sures’ garage door and cordoned the area with caution tape. UCLA responded to their vandalism and intimidation by imposing interim suspensions on both groups. Republicans in Washington, DC have said that anti-Zionist extremism on college campuses 'will no longer be tolerated in the Trump administration.' Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has enacted a slew of policies aimed at reining in their disruptive and discriminatory behavior. Continuing work started during his first administration — when Trump issued Executive Order 13899 to ensure that civil rights law apply equally Jews — Trump’s recent 'Additional Measures to Combat Antisemitism' calls for 'using all appropriate legal tools to prosecute, remove, or otherwise … hold to account perpetrators of unlawful antisemitic harassment and violence.' The order also requires each government agency to write a report explaining how it can be of help in carrying out its enforcement. Another major provision of the order calls for the deportation of extremist 'alien' student activists, whose support for terrorist organizations, intellectual and material, such as Hamas contributed to fostering antisemitism, violence, and property destruction.

South Africa open to nuclear cooperation with Russia and Iran, mi...	South Africa’s latest comments on being open to cooperating with Iran on nuclear matters may further anger the US — and risk an energy deal currently in the works. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner South Africa would consider partnering with Russia or Iran for expanding its civilian nuclear power capacity, a move that could further strain relations with the US and delay the renewal of a strategic energy agreement. 'We can’t have a contract that says Iran or Russia must not bid, we can’t have that condition,' said Minister of Mineral and Petroleum Resources Gwede Mantashe, a leading government advocate for expanding the country’s nuclear capacity. 'If they are the best offer on the table, we’ll take any [country],' he told Reuters. South Africa is looking to add 2,500 megawatts of new nuclear capacity, building on its existing Koeberg plant, the only nuclear power plant in Africa, to address electricity outages that have hampered the economy. The comments from a senior South African government minister came after US President Donald Trump earlier this month signed an executive order to 'halt foreign aid or assistance' to South Africa partly in response to the country’s anti-Israel stance, including its case at the United Nations’ top court accusing the Jewish state of committing genocide in Gaza. Trump’s order was also a response to South Africa’s new land expropriation law, which the US argues discriminates against Afrikaners, a minority South African ethnic group of European descent. In response, South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola vowed his country will continue pursuing its case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). During an interview with the Financial Times published last week, he also denied Trump’s remarks about South Africa’s new land reform, stating that the White House’s statements were 'misinformation.' In his executive order, Trump also accused South Africa of working with Iran 'to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.' US intelligence agencies have for years described Iran as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism, and Washington fears that Iran’s own nuclear program is ultimately designed to build nuclear weapons — a charge denied by Tehran. 'While we do have a good relationship with Iran, we don’t have any nuclear programs with them, nor any trade to speak of,' Lamola said in response to Trump’s executive order. Since the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, which is armed and funded by Iran, invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the South African government has been one of the world’s fiercest critics of Israel’s ensuing military campaign in Gaza. In late 2023, for example, South Africa temporarily withdrew its diplomats from Israel and shut down its embassy in Tel Aviv, saying the government was 'extremely concerned at the continued killing of children and innocent civilians' in Gaza. Then in December of that year, South Africa hosted two Hamas officials who attended a government-sponsored conference in solidarity with the Palestinians. One of the officials had been sanctioned by the US government for his role with the terrorist organization. Months later, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa led the crowd at an election rally in a chant of 'From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free' — a popular slogan among anti-Israel activists that has been widely interpreted as a genocidal call for the destruction of the Jewish state, which is located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. South Africa’s latest comments on being open to cooperating with Iran on nuclear matters may further anger the US — and risk an energy deal currently in the works. South Africa and the United States have been negotiating a new civilian nuclear pact, called a Section 123 agreement, which is necessary for the export of US-made nuclear fuel or equipment. Implemented in 1997, the previous agreement expired in December 2022. It is still unclear whether Trump’s executive order will affect the new pact in any way or further delay negotiations. 'The allegations made in the executive order can significantly complicate getting the agreement renewed,' Isabel Bosman, a nuclear energy researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs, told Reuters. According to Zizamele Mbambo, a senior energy department official, the new agreement is almost ready, but it hasn’t been signed yet because legal processes are still ongoing. 'As far as we know, both sides remain firmly committed to concluding this new agreement,' Mbambo said.

Foreign funding of judicial-reform protests spurs Knesset legisla...	Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved a bill on Sunday to impose an 80% tax on donations from foreign entities to Israeli non-profits. By David Isaac, JNS As billionaire Elon Musk and his youthful team of tech wizards tear through America’s administrative state, exposing waste and misuse of funds, reports emerged that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funded judicial-reform protests in Israel. While this would constitute a blatant case of U.S. interference in Israel’s internal affairs, the way in which funds bounce from one group to another before reaching their final target makes it difficult to produce hard evidence.Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved a bill on Sunday to impose an 80% tax on donations from foreign entities to Israeli non-profits. However, reports of heavy foreign funding of key groups opposed to the Israeli government’s plan to reform the judiciary led Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself to weigh in last week in a Knesset speech, blasting what he called the 'almost inconceivable' amounts of foreign money that drove the protest movement. Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved a bill on Sunday to impose an 80% tax on donations from foreign entities to Israeli non-profits. Currently, those donations are tax-free. The heart of the current debate is Blue and White Future, an Israeli NGO that funded and ran the headquarters for the coalition of groups opposing judicial reform. A significant percentage of its funding came from foreign sources. The HQ’s website lists some half-dozen protest groups supported by Blue and White Future, including Achim L’Neshek ('Brothers in Arms'), which called for reservists to refuse service, and Bonot Alternativa ('Women Building an Alternative'), which introduced Handmaid’s Tale costumes to the protests. The key figures in Blue and White Future are Orni Petruschka, a high-tech entrepreneur; Ami Ayalon, a former head of the Internal Security Service (Shin Bet); and Gilead Sher, an attorney who served as chief of staff and policy coordinator to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, one of the most vociferous of Netanyahu’s opponents. Blue and White Future was founded in 2009 as Blue and White Peace. Its initial purpose was to 'enhance and highlight' public support for the two-state solution. It changed its name by the end of that year to Blue and White Future and then its raison d’être in January 2023 (when Justice Minister Yariv Levin announced the government’s judicial-reform plan), saying its new goal was 'to preserve the democratic character of the State of Israel.' In September 2023, it hired Washington-based PR firm Trident DMG, for a three-month contract of $75,000 for 'strategic communications services' to boost its cause in the United States. It would have found a ready ear in the then-Biden administration, which made no secret of its opposition to the judicial-reform plan. U.S. President Joe Biden himself spoke out against it several times in 2023. Blue and White Future’s financials, filed with Israel’s Registrar of Associations, show that the NGO received a major shot of money in 2023, with donations jumping to 134 million shekels (~$38 million) from 824,730 shekels ($232,000) in 2022. Its budget in previous years hovered in that lower range. In 2023, it spent most of its budget, or $31 million, on opposition to judicial reform. Approximately 54%, or 83 million shekels (~$23 million), of the donations came from foreign sources and 71 million shekels (~$20 million) from within Israel. Of the foreign funds, 78 million shekels came from two American nonprofits: the Middle East Peace Dialogue Network (MEDPN)—14 million shekels (~$4 million) and PEF Israel Endowment Funds—64 million shekels (~$18 million). The MEDPN receives funds from NGOs that were given U.S. government funds. But it’s impossible to trace the origin of the money, as it’s already too far removed from the source. For instance, USAID gives to Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, Inc., which donates to the Jewish Communal Fund, which in turn donates to MEDPN, according to DataRepublican, a website that tracks taxpayer funds. PEF Israel’s receipt of U.S. taxpayer funds is negligible. It received $149,000 in indirect government monies, or 0.5% of its total contributions of $281 million in 2023, DataRepublican reported. The torrent of U.S. taxpayer money streaming out of U.S. government coffers and adding to America’s $2 trillion deficit is what the Trump administration wants to bring under control. In a Feb. 11 press conference, Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), joined President Donald Trump at the Oval Office to discuss his efforts. He noted that many payments his team found didn’t have a categorization code or description of what the payments were for, meaning there was no way to track them. There is a 'massive number' of such checks 'flying out of the building,' Musk said. With such few basic controls, it seems unlikely that Musk’s team will uncover a smoking gun pointing to USAID grants going to Israeli NGOs. However, Knesset Member Yitzhak Kroizer of the Otzma Yehudit Party, who wrote to Musk on Feb. 16 requesting a meeting to discuss the misuse of U.S. taxpayer funds in Israel, expressed cautious optimism that much could be uncovered. 'It will be very difficult to track all the money,' Kroizer told JNS. 'But we will be able to identify fund transfers from certain entities, parties and nonprofits and how it flows from the United States to groups in Israel.' Kroizer is interested in exposing the mechanism by which the funds are piped in, not specific dollar amounts, noting that the names of the associations change but the methods remain the same. 'They find the same ways each time to transfer the funds,' he said. The U.S. has a history of interfering in Israeli politics, along with certain European countries, he added. 'It’s the same countries all the time.' In May 2023, a bill that would have significantly limited the amount that Israeli NGOs could receive from foreign governments was dropped after harsh criticism from the United States, Germany and France. By protesting the bill, those countries were 'probably' pointing a guilty finger at themselves, Kroizer said. In his letter to Musk, he noted, 'It is well known in both Israel and the United States that past administrations have used American funds to exert improper influence in Israeli affairs. The 2015 incident involving OneVoice and VI5—organizations that received funding from the Obama administration while working to oppose the Netanyahu government—left a lasting negative impression.' Kroizer was referring to the scandal in which a U.S. Senate subcommittee found that the Obama administration’s State Department had donated about $350,000 to a group trying to defeat Netanyahu in the 2015 Israeli elections. The Knesset passed a law the following year requiring nonprofits that receive more than half their funding from abroad to disclose it each year to the NGO Registrar at the Justice Ministry. The United States expressed its concern with that law, too, with the Obama administration’s Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro meeting with the law’s sponsor, then-Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked. A U.S. embassy statement released after the meeting put in diplomatic language American displeasure, saying Shapiro 'reiterated' the United States’ view that 'a free and functioning civil society is an essential element of a healthy democracy, and that governments must protect free expression and peaceful dissent and create an atmosphere where all voices can be heard.' It remains to be seen whether the current proposed Knesset bill, whose stated purpose is 'to reduce the indirect influence of foreign government and political entities on the State of Israel'—if it becomes law—will have better luck than previous efforts to sharply cut outside activity in shaping Israeli politics.

Terrorists behind Nova massacre had planned to take over city	Israeli army's investigation into the security failures during the October 7th invasion of Israel reveal that terrorist forces which conducted massacre at music festival had arrived there by accident - and had actually planned to take over a nearby city. By World Israel News Staff The most deadly massacre carried out by Gazan terrorists during their invasion of Israel on October 7th was the result in part of a navigational error by the terrorists, who had planned a potentially larger attack on a nearby Israeli city. On Monday, Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, revealed that the Israeli military probe into the invasion found that the terrorists who carried out the Nova music festival massacre outside Kibbutz Re'im on the morning of October 7th had actually targeted the city of Netivot. The Nova massacre, the deadliest massacre of October 7th, leaving over 360 people dead and 44 taken hostage, was carried out by a force of 100 to 120 terrorists from Hamas' Nuseirat Brigade. The terrorist force crossed over from Gaza into Israeli territory during the second wave of attacks at 7:30 a.m., approximately an hour after the initial attacks. The Nuseirat force entered Israeli territory in 14 pickup trucks and two motorcycles, the report said, and was armed with two heavy machine guns, three smaller machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, assault rifles, and grenades. The terrorists had been assigned to capture the city of Netivot, but during the invasion the force lost its bearings, eventually stumbling upon the Nova festival outside of Kibbutz Rei'm instead, an hour and a half after the force entered Israeli territory. Had the terrorists succeeded into locating Netivot, located five kilometers northeast of Kibbutz Re'im and the Nova festival, the city would have been the most populous Israeli community to face Gazan invaders on October 7th. Home to roughly 52,000 people in 2023, Netivot is significantly larger than the the two cities invaded on October 7th: Ofakim, with a population of 35,000, and Sderot, home to 33,000.

Lawmakers who back Hamas are ‘sicker’ than the terrorists, says H...	The putative U.S. ambassador to Israel also put the military option on the table regarding the president’s absolute opposition to a nuclear Iran. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, slammed Congressional supporters of Hamas and said Iran is under definite threat of attack if it doesn’t give up its nuclear ambitions in an interview Monday on Fox News’ Varney and Co. show. After citing the Hamas-led massacre of 1,200 people and taking of 250 hostages during its October 7, 2023, invasion of Israel that immediately sparked war in the Gaza Strip, interviewer Stuart Varney expressed surprise that the terror organization could still have backers in Congress. Without mentioning any names, Huckabee responded, 'It’s beyond comprehension that anybody would understand what Hamas did, what they continue to do, the threats they continue to make as recently as a week ago, saying they want to have another October 7, and somehow show support for that.' While the terrorists 'are very sick people,' he added, 'the sicker ones' are 'the ones who know what they did&#8230;some of whom even serve in Congress, and think it was OK – or at least think it was justified.' In the immediate aftermath of the massacre in southern Israel, Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) blamed Israel for the slaughter, saying that its 'apartheid system' creates 'conditions that can lead to resistance.' She and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have repeatedly falsely accused Israel of breaking international law and committing genocide, while ignoring Hamas’ documented war crimes. Tlaib has also employed at least three individuals with Hamas connections and was called out as a 'Hamas sympathizer' by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries after she repeated a lie about the IDF attacking a hospital early on in the war when it was struck by a failed Palestinian missile launched at Israel. Huckabee praised Trump’s firm support of the Jewish state while calling the former president Joe Biden’s policy towards the Israel and Hamas 'schizophrenic.' 'One day, he’s all for Israel. The next day, he puts more pressure on them to have a ceasefire than he did on Hamas to release American hostages. This was insane, and it’s cost us a lot of time, money, and human lives,' he said. Regarding Iran’s nuclear program, Varney ran a clip of National Security Advisor Mike Waltz saying that Trump has been very clear that the Islamic Republic 'can never have a nuclear weapon,' since it was 'an irrational actor that we cannot allow to have their finger on the button.' He then asked Huckabee, 'Doesn’t it sound to you like an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is coming?' The future ambassador answered, 'Either that or they’re going to surrender it, they’re not going to get one.' He said 'everyone else in the entire world who has a brain' is 'giving a standing ovation to that doctrine,' including the Arab countries in the region. 'They all understand that Israel is no threat to them, they don’t have to worry that Israel is going to launch an attack on Egypt or Jordan or the Saudis. They’re worried about Iran,' he continued. 'And whether it’s Israel that pulls the trigger, or it’s a combination of nations, I hope the Iranian leaders, as crazed as they are, have at least enough sense to listen carefully to what’s being said. They’re not going to have a nuclear weapon, full stop.'

Israel accuses Egypt of breaking 1979 peace treaty with Sinai bui...	Israeli Ambassador to US warns Egypt's military buildup in the Sinai Peninsula constitutes a 'very serious violation' of the 1979 peace treaty brokered by President Jimmy Carter. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior Israeli diplomat has accused Egypt of violating the landmark peace treaty between the two countries by militarizing the Sinai Peninsula. Late last month, Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Yehiel Leiter, addressed a gathering of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's meeting with President Donald Trump in the White House. A video of Leiter's address during the event was published on Friday, only to be later removed. During his remarks, Leiter blasted Egypt for militarizing the Sinai Peninsula, a move that if verified would constitute a 'very serious violation,' Leiter said. In 1979, then-President Jimmy Carter brokered the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty, ending 31 years of hostilities and establishing full relations between the two countries. The agreement, which was predicated on Israel's return of the entire Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, imposed strict limits on Cairo's rights to deploy armed forces to the Sinai, including a single armored division in the Suez Canal Zone, four battalions of border police in Central Sinai, with no military presence in the Eastern Sinai, facing the Israeli frontier. Beginning in 2013, Israel has approved temporary deployments of Egyptian forces in the Central and Eastern Sinai to combat Islamist forces in the Peninsula, or to curb Hamas smuggling into the Gaza Strip. However, according to Leiter, Egypt is now constructing military facilities in the Sinai with clear offensive military capabilities. 'There are bases being built, and they can only be used for offensive operations and offensive weapons,' Leiter said. 'This is a clear violation. For a long time, this issue has been shoved to the side, but it continues. This is an issue that we are going to put on the table – very soon and very emphatically.' During the 46 years since the treaty was inked, Israel has never before accused Egypt of violating the deal, which marked the first time an Arab state ended a state of war with Israel and established full relations. Last week, Yuval Steinitz, a former Strategic Affairs Minister under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who now chairs the Israeli arms manufacturer Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, said Egypt's buildup in the Sinai is a cause for concern. 'There is definitely reason to view Egypt’s military buildup with concern,' Steinitz told Yedioth Aharanoth. 'Relations between Israel and Egypt are currently stable, but if one day we become weak, everyone in the region will seize the opportunity.'

‘Trump, you’re my hope’ – Freed hostage to US president	I beg you, don’t stop until all the hostages, the living and the dead, are brought home,' Berger said in a heartfelt plea. By World Israel News Staff Former Hamas hostage Agam Berger thanked President Donald J. Trump in a video posted on social media, crediting him with securing her release from captivity and stressing the importance of continuing the hostage deal. Berger, who was kidnapped from the Nahal Oz base adjacent to the Gaza Strip on October 7th, 2023, was released in late January after being held by the terror group for nearly 15 months. In the video, Berger thanked Trump 'from the bottom of my heart for all you have done and all that you continue to do for the hostages.' Addressing Trump, Berger emphasized that 'because of you, we came home.' Breaking: Former hostage Agam Berger, who was just released from captivity, thanks @POTUS Trump for his efforts to free the hostages. 'There are a lot of people whose lives depends on you, you're their only hope. I suffered a lot, others are still there suffering'. @SteveWitkoff pic.twitter.com/ozQJCrsEcj &mdash; Neria Kraus (@NeriaKraus) February 18, 2025 She added that there are additional hostages in Gaza 'who really depend on you and are waiting for you to save them from there.' She stressed that Trump 'has the power to' save the rest of the hostages, whom she said are suffering every day they remain in captivity. 'I beg you, don’t stop until all the hostages, the living and the dead, are brought home,' Berger said in a heartfelt plea. Trump reposted the video without comment on his Truth Social platform. Berger was one of five female observation soldiers recently released by the terror group, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Keith Siegel, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, recently released a video thanking Trump after he was released from captivity earlier in February. 'President Trump, you are the reason I am home alive,' Siegel said in the video. 'You are the reason I was reunited with my beloved wife, four children and five grandchildren.' Like Berger, Siegel beseeched Trump to ensure the ceasefire holds until the hostage deal is completed. 'I trust in your strength and leadership Mr. President,' Siegel said. 'The helpless hostages in the dark, cold tunnels in Gaza also trust you. Please bring them home.'

‘All options on the table’ for stopping Iran’s nuke program, says...	Michael Waltz, President Trump's National Security Advisor, says the president is 'dead serious' about preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, says 'all options are on the table' to block Tehran's nuclear ambitions. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration is committed to prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, a top administration official said Sunday, hinting that the U.S. is considering military intervention to prevent Iran's nuclear program from reaching break-out capacity. On Sunday, President Donald Trump's National Security Advisor, former Congressman Michael Waltz, appeared on Fox News warning that Trump is 'dead serious' about preventing Iran from going nuclear and that 'all options are on the table' to prevent Tehran from achieving weapons-grade enrichment. 'I could speak to what the President has repeatedly said, and that is Iran can never have a nuclear weapon,' Waltz said. 'That not only would be existential for Israel. I think it would be existential for the entire world, because it could kick off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.' Waltz refused to speak directly to what proposals are on the table for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, saying only that Trump has shown he is ready to take 'whatever action is necessary.' 'How we get there, I'm not going to get into the details of here, but the President has also expressed a willingness to take whatever action is necessary.' 'All options are on the table, but also to talk to Iran as well, if they want to give up their entire program and not play games, as we have seen Iran do in the past in prior negotiations.' 'So all options are on the table, but I'll promise you this: President Trump is absolutely serious, deadly serious, when he says Iran can never have a nuke, and certainly not on President Trump's watch. They are an irrational actor that we cannot allow to have their finger on the button.' During President Joe Biden's lame duck session following the election of Donald Trump last November, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan briefed Biden on possible options for military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, should Iran attempt to rush towards development of a nuclear weapon prior to Trump's inauguration last month. Israel is reportedly considering airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities sometime over the next few months, U.S. intel officials estimate.

The eastern part of Oregon is ideologically at odds with the urban and progressive areas of the state, as evidenced by the intensity of anti-police protests in Portland in 2020. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Conservative eastern Oregon has proposed to secede from the state and become part of the neighboring red state of Idaho. The eastern part of Oregon is ideologically at odds with the urban and progressive areas of the state, as evidenced by the intensity of anti-police protests in Portland in 2020. 'The Greater Idaho Movement has always been about the people of Eastern Oregon getting their voices heard and helping those communities get the kind of state-level governance they actually want,' Executive Director Matt McCaw told Fox News Digital. 'If the Oregon Legislature truly believes in democracy, they will honor those voters' wishes and move forward on making a border change happen.' Earlier this month, State Rep. Mark Owens (R-Malheur) introduced HB 3844, a bill that establishes a task force to assess the impact of moving the Idaho border to include approximately 13 eastern Oregon counties. The measure also mandates that a report be submitted to lawmakers in Salem. The Greater Idaho Movement began sponsoring measures in favor of secession during the Portland riots in 2020, and calls to join Idaho have grown louder as the ideological divisions persist. In 2020, Portland was nearly at a standstill during a violent standoff in front of the Mark Hatfield Federal Courthouse that lasted for days. Greater Idaho President Mike McCarter commented on the proposal: 'We are encouraged to see the representatives of Eastern Oregon coming together to advocate for their voters by bringing these bills to the Legislature. The people of Eastern Oregon have made it clear they want to explore moving the border and joining Idaho.' 'This movement has always been about the people of Eastern Oregon getting their voices heard and helping those communities get the kind of state-level governance they actually want.' Although similar calls to secede from one state and join another have rarely been successful, there are other proposals in various parts of the United States. For instance, a number of conservative, rural communities in Illinois are seeking to disassociate themselves from progressive Chicago and join neighboring red state Indiana. For decades, Staten Island has sought to secede from New York City, and despite a 2-to-1 vote by the residents to secede, the measure was quashed by New York State's Democratic Party.

Although Israel informed then-U.S. President Biden about the recordings, the Biden administration still pressured Israel to send hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza daily. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Recordings of conversations between Hamas officials prove that the humanitarian aid entering Gaza in 2024 went directly to Hamas, Channel 12 revealed this week. Although Israel informed then-U.S. President Biden about the recordings, the Biden Administration still pressured Israel to send hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza daily. The recordings also provided further evidence of Hamas' close ties with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). In one recording, a Hamas member said, 'Currently, monitoring is in progress, and we will receive updates. There are confirmed injuries, including some UNRWA employees. Two of the injured are police officers.' In another conversation, junior Hamas members complained they were not receiving aid, and in response, they were told their wives had been attacked in a Rafah mosque. 'They enter the women’s room and beat them,' the Hamas members were heard saying. 'We will redeem our people with our soul and our blood.' One source responded to the incident by stating, 'The leadership is not involved and has been monitoring the situation from the very beginning.' The conversation also revealed anger at senior Hamas officials over their corrupt behavior. A junior Hamas member stated, 'I promise you, we will tear you to pieces. Make sure the leadership in Khan Yunis hears this too. We will tear you apart. You’re only focused on yourselves. There is no real leadership.' He continued, 'All the leaders in Khan Yunis should hang their heads in shame, as they are not men. They invade women's rooms and assault them there. Everyone must understand that our honor is far more valuable than our lives.' Gazan civilians have repeatedly claimed that Hamas steals humanitarian aid and keeps it for themselves or sells it at exorbitant prices. In a recorded conversation, a Palestinian man in Gaza told an IDF soldier that Hamas was stealing UNRWA humanitarian aid. He said, 'The situation is terrible because the people responsible for the humanitarian aid are thieves.' 'Hamas has their hands on UNRWA administration workers and controls UNRWA,' he explained.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich signed an additional lien of 320 million shekels in Palestinian Authority (PA) funds on Monday. This was the latest in a series of liens that freeze designated PA funds to prevent them from being used to finance terrorism. The money will be used instead to compensate victims of terror. Smotrich stated, 'There is no more just and righteous action than stopping the Palestinian Authority from financing terrorism and redirecting its funds to support the families of terror victims. This is a crucial step in our national fight against terrorism and the Palestinian Authority that fosters it.' He continued, 'This action aligns with the Gaza payroll deductions, the halt on payments to terrorists, and numerous other measures I’ve implemented as part of the unwavering policy I've consistently followed since taking office. We are cutting off the sources of funding for terrorism and preventing the Palestinian Authority from using its funds to fuel incitement and violence. I will continue to take decisive action to ensure the security of Israel's citizens.' Last month, Israel recovered funds to cover a decade-old $1.1 billion Palestinian Authority electricity debt by redirecting money from the Norwegian Fund, where PA funds have been deposited since the beginning of the war. The Finance Ministry issued an order to the Norwegian Fund, which had been receiving 275 million shekels monthly, deducted from PA funds. The money from the Norwegian Fund will be used to settle outstanding debts the PA has owed to Israel for over 10 years. Half of the funds will go to companies that provided fuel to the PA; the other half will be directed to Israel’s electric company. Last spring, after Norway announced its recognition of a Palestinian state, Smotrich halted payments to the Norwegian Fund and redirected the funds to a new account. Instead of transferring money to the Palestinian Authority after the war, Israel will now use the funds to pay off the PA’s debts to Israel.

With 21 staff members having lost immediate family members and hundreds serving as reservists, it’s the unseen bravery of these heroes that keeps Gozlan and her team working 500 days later. By Jewish Breaking News Dawn hadn’t yet broken over Jerusalem when the first casualties began arriving at Hadassah’s emergency rooms on October 7, 2023. The hospital staff didn’t know it then, but they were about to treat victims of the deadliest attack on Israeli soil in decades, even as some of their own loved ones were caught in the violence. Lilach Gozlan, head of staff welfare at Hadassah, remWith 21 staff members having lost immediate family members and hundreds serving as reservists, it’s the unseen bravery of these heroes that keeps Gozlan and her team working 500 days later.embers those first days vividly. When she learned that one employee’s family had fallen into financial crisis after losing a relative at Nova, she knew they had to act. 'We couldn’t leave them alone, helpless,' she says. The hospital’s initial response looked a lot like triage. They set up a welfare fund. They mobilized 500 volunteers to call every single employee, paying special attention to the 86 staff members living within range of Gaza. However, money and phone calls were just the beginning. Children were another immediate concern. With schools closed and parents needed at the hospital, Hadassah’s welfare department transformed protected spaces near the hospital into makeshift daycare centers. Pre-army volunteers and professional staff cared for up to 200 kids, from newborns to 12-year-olds, running from early morning until late afternoon. Then came the military call-ups. Over 400 Hadassah employees joined the reserves, along with nearly 500 of their family members. When these workers started returning to their hospital jobs, the cracks began to show. Some of them couldn’t shake what they’d seen. 'In COVID there was a set formula, we’d send food packages to those affected and so on,' Gozlan explains. 'But there were no procedures for October 7 and what’s happened since.' Yet the hospital kept adapting. They brought in experts for webinars on trauma. They trained managers on how to support returning soldiers. They worked to keep peace between Jewish and Arab staff members. They even brought in performers to lift spirits. With 21 staff members having lost immediate family members and hundreds serving as reservists, it’s the unseen bravery of these heroes that keeps Gozlan and her team working 500 days later. They’re still distributing aid packages, still providing counseling, and still making sure no one falls through the cracks.

Hamas expected to return bodies of several hostages on Thursday	Meanwhile, Ynet reported on Monday night that Israel is demanding the freedom of six living hostages instead of the agreed three during the seventh release scheduled for Saturday. By JNS Jerusalem is preparing to receive the bodies of four or five hostages on Thursday who were murdered in captivity in the Gaza Strip, Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster reported on Monday. The ceasefire deal with the Palestinian terrorist group stipulates that the bodies of four hostages will be returned to the Jewish state on the 33rd day of the ceasefire, which went into effect Jan. 19, an Israeli official told Walla news. According to Kan News, Hamas is scheduled to hand over the names of the slain captives on Thursday morning. Israeli military ambulances will collect the bodies at a meeting point, from where they will be brought to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. Officials involved in the preparations stressed that the hostages’ families will only be informed after the identification process is completed. Meanwhile, Ynet reported on Monday night that Israel is demanding the freedom of six living hostages during the seventh release scheduled for Saturday. According to the deal, Hamas is required to release three captives. In exchange for releasing the additional hostages, the Israeli government has signaled its willingness to allow the entry of hundreds of additional caravans into the Strip, the report claimed. The three latest returnees from Hamas captivity in Gaza were reunited on Saturday with their families—American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36; Alexander ('Sasha') Troufanov, 29, who has dual Russian-Israeli citizenship; and Argentine-Israeli national Iair Horn, 46. Saturday’s release was the sixth such round under phase one of the ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump’s leadership and Israel’s coordination with the United States on Saturday, highlighting that the reinforcement of IDF troops around Gaza and the U.S. president’s firm stance led to the release of three hostages despite Hamas’s threats to delay the exchange. Trump on Saturday congratulated the freed hostages but made clear that their release fell short of his call to free all the captives. 'Hamas has just released three Hostages from GAZA, including an American Citizen. They seem to be in good shape! This differs from their [Hamas’s] statement last week that they would not release any Hostages,' he wrote on his Truth Social social media platform. 'Israel will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O’CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES. The United States will back the decision they make!' he added, apparently referring to U.S. Eastern Time, or 7 p.m. in Israel. Trump’s deadline was a reference to his previous warning that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed if Hamas did not release all of the hostages. According to official estimates, 73 hostages remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza after 500 days, including 70 abducted during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

500 days in captivity: Knesset hears of released hostages’ ongoin...	These are captivity survivors who have endured life-altering experiences that will leave them with lifelong scars,' said Professor Hagai Levine, who has been actively accompanying the families since the beginning of the war. By Sveta Listratov, TPS As Israelis marked the 500th day of captivity for the hostages in Gaza, lawmakers of the Knesset’s Health Committee gathered on Monday to hear about the medical and psychological state of those who have returned. 'It is crucial to hear the entire truth about the situation of those who have returned from Gaza and their families. The testimonies we have heard here are important,' said MK Tatiana Mazarsky of Yesh Atid, who initiated the committee meeting. 'It is difficult to expose the trauma, and that’s why the world doesn’t care about our suffering. They don’t see our pain. They think we are only attackers. We must not remain silent. We must show what we are going through.' The session included emotional testimony from the families of returnees and the medical professionals involved in the rehabilitation. Shemi Kalderon, whose 54-year-old nephew Ofer was held captive and released a few weeks ago, shared his nephew’s health condition. Ofer was hospitalized for several days after his return due to a severe flu and pneumonia. 'Three months ago, Ofer weighed 25 kilos less than today. He said that in the tunnel where he was held, there was a scale. When they realized he would be among the released hostages, and saw how he looked, he had been fed rotten vegetables. He hadn’t seen daylight for 484 days. He had no access to a shower, maybe once every two or three months, all that aside from the physical injuries he endured,' Kalderon shared. Carmit Palty Katzir insisted to lawmakers that it is impossible for her, her family, and the entire nation to heal the wounds at this time. 'We are still at war; it’s the 500th of October for us today. Until the last hostage returns, we will not heal,' she declared. Her father was murdered at Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7 while her mother Hanna and brother Elad were taken to Gaza. Hanna was released during a temporary ceasefire in November 2023, but died of health complications from her captivity the following year. Soldiers recovered Elad’s body in April 2024. 'It is a disgrace and a shame that we have reached day 500. Everywhere I go, I feel compelled to warn that there are helpless people in captivity we must save,' Palty Katzir said. Families of returning hostages have previously described physical abuse, torture, and psychological pressure their loved ones went through, while images of emaciated returnees shocked Israelis. Professor Hagai Levine, who has been actively accompanying the families since the beginning of the war, described the situation with hostages as unprecedented in Israel. 'These are captivity survivors who have endured life-altering experiences that will leave them with lifelong scars,' he said, calling for comprehensive, systematic research into their condition. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi of the Health Ministry told lawmakers, 'Even if some may look fine on the outside, the hospital tests often reveal hidden damage.' She stressed the need for sustained, individualized care for each returning captive and said the ministry will work 'hand in hand' with the survivors and their families for years to come. Michal Mizrahi from Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital, echoed the need for long-term support, detailing the condition of four hostages the hospital treated, who have been held underground for extended periods. 'They suffered from muscle atrophy, drastic weight loss, and vitamin deficiencies,' she reported, stressing that rehabilitation is focused on restoring physical capabilities, with continuous evaluation and nutritional support. The committee acknowledged significant improvements in the health system work with hostages, but recognized persistent gaps, including the need for better mental health services, long-term financial support, and addressing the needs of secondary victims—children, siblings, and caregivers of the surviving hostages.

IDF nabs terrorists, seizes weapons, cash in Judea and Samaria	During another operation in the Ephraim Brigade area of responsibility, which covers the Tulkarem and Qalqilya sectors in western Samaria, forces arrested a terrorism suspect and seized an M-16 rifle and two handguns. By JNS Israeli security forces arrested Palestinian terrorists while seizing arms and funds during overnight raids throughout Judea and Samaria on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces said. The IDF, Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and Israel Police 'continue to operate throughout Judea and Samaria to thwart terrorism in order to maintain the security of the citizens of the State of Israel,' the army said on Monday. In Deir Abu Mash’al, 15 miles west of Ramallah and close to the Samaria security barrier across from Ben-Gurion International Airport, troops detained seven suspects. Meanwhile, in Al-Arroub, near Bethlehem in Judea, two were arrested. At the same time, Israel’s security agencies continue 'Operation Iron Wall' to thwart terror in the northern part of Samaria, the IDF said. 'Overnight, forces located and confiscated a number of weapons in Jenin, and destroyed a number of explosive devices in Tulkarem,' according to the military. During another operation in the Ephraim Brigade area of responsibility, which covers the Tulkarem and Qalqilya sectors in western Samaria, forces arrested a terrorism suspect and seized an M-16 rifle and two handguns. In the Arab village of Osarin, located near Nablus in the IDF’s Samaria Brigade deployment area, one wanted terrorist was arrested. The Israeli government recorded thousands of Palestinian terrorist attacks against Jews in 2024—including many in Judea and Samaria. Earlier this month, the IDF expanded 'Operation Iron Wall,' saying it plans to form a new battalion that will remain in Jenin and Tulkarem after the counter-terrorism operation. In January, an unnamed senior security force told Israel’s Channel 14 News broadcaster that the large-scale campaign against Iranian-backed terrorist organizations in northern Samaria could take several months. 'When it ends, the terror camps will cease to exist. What we did in Gaza, we will do to them as well; we will leave them in ruins,' the source said.

Construction of the outposts has already started and many have already been built. By JNS Israel Defense Forces soldiers will remain deployed at five outposts in Southern Lebanon beyond the Feb. 18 deadline set out in the truce deal with Beirut, the army’s Northern Command confirmed on Monday. Israel’s decision to keep boots on the ground in Lebanon was made in conjunction with the Trump administration. The company-size posts, located within several hundred meters of the border, will be manned by hundreds of IDF soldiers until the political echelon decides otherwise. The five outposts are located at a hill near Labbouneh, opposite the Israeli border town of Shlomi; on the Jabal Blat peak, opposite Moshav Zar’it; on a hill opposite Moshav Avivim and Kibbutz Malkia; on a hill opposite Moshav Margaliot; and on a hill opposite the town of Metula. The IDF is taking into account that Hezbollah terrorists may attempt to damage the outposts—which are all located outside of built-up areas—and is preparing for expected provocations against troops. Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem warned Israel on Sunday that if it does not withdraw its forces by Tuesday, 'we will know how to deal with it. 'Israel must fully withdraw on February 18, it has no excuse,' the top terrorist leader said in a televised speech cited by the France 24 outlet. תום תקופת המבחן בלבנון מחר: בפיקוד הצפון נערכים לסוף תקופת היישום להפסקת האש בלבנון, כולל נסיגה של כוחות צה'ל, מלבד חמישה מוצבים שנבנו בשטח לבנון כפי שפרסמנו בשבוע שעבר במשך חודשיים וחצי, כך אומרים בפיקוד הצפון, לוחמי צה'ל פעלו בדרום לבנון למקסם את ההישג שהגיעו אליהם במהלך… pic.twitter.com/3B6aqR74rv &mdash; איתי בלומנטל Itay Blumental (@ItayBlumental) February 17, 2025 In addition to its continued presence in Lebanon, the IDF is working to build forward operating outposts near every border town. Construction of the outposts has already started and many have already been built. If the relative calm on the border with Lebanon is preserved, residents of evacuated communities in northern Israel will be able to return to their homes on the planned date of March 1, the IDF statement said. The truce with Lebanon, which took effect on Nov. 27, mandated an IDF redeployment within 60 days. However, the U.S.-monitored agreement is expected to continue until Feb. 18, the White House said on Jan. 26. Under the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, the IDF is to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon as the Lebanese Armed Forces and U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon assume responsibility for ensuring Hezbollah remains disarmed in the country’s south. However, there have been growing doubts in Jerusalem that the LAF can fulfill its obligation to clamp down on Hezbollah’s presence. The Israeli army remains engaged in frequent operations in the area. On Sunday, IDF troops destroyed an underground tunnel system near the border that was used by the terrorist group’s elite Radwan Unit and contained 'living quarters and combat equipment,' the military said. In recent weeks, soldiers from the 810th 'Mountain' Brigade, under the command of the 210th 'Bashan' Division, completed dozens of targeted raids in Southern Lebanon’s Mount Dov area to 'remove threats facing the State of Israel and its citizens,' according to the IDF statement.

Conservative residents of liberal US state want to secede and joi...	The eastern part of Oregon is ideologically at odds with the urban and progressive areas of the state, as evidenced by the intensity of anti-police protests in Portland in 2020. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Conservative eastern Oregon has proposed to secede from the state and become part of the neighboring red state of Idaho. The eastern part of Oregon is ideologically at odds with the urban and progressive areas of the state, as evidenced by the intensity of anti-police protests in Portland in 2020. 'The Greater Idaho Movement has always been about the people of Eastern Oregon getting their voices heard and helping those communities get the kind of state-level governance they actually want,' Executive Director Matt McCaw told Fox News Digital. 'If the Oregon Legislature truly believes in democracy, they will honor those voters' wishes and move forward on making a border change happen.' Earlier this month, State Rep. Mark Owens (R-Malheur) introduced HB 3844, a bill that establishes a task force to assess the impact of moving the Idaho border to include approximately 13 eastern Oregon counties. The measure also mandates that a report be submitted to lawmakers in Salem. The Greater Idaho Movement began sponsoring measures in favor of secession during the Portland riots in 2020, and calls to join Idaho have grown louder as the ideological divisions persist. In 2020, Portland was nearly at a standstill during a violent standoff in front of the Mark Hatfield Federal Courthouse that lasted for days. Greater Idaho President Mike McCarter commented on the proposal: 'We are encouraged to see the representatives of Eastern Oregon coming together to advocate for their voters by bringing these bills to the Legislature. The people of Eastern Oregon have made it clear they want to explore moving the border and joining Idaho.' 'This movement has always been about the people of Eastern Oregon getting their voices heard and helping those communities get the kind of state-level governance they actually want.' Although similar calls to secede from one state and join another have rarely been successful, there are other proposals in various parts of the United States. For instance, a number of conservative, rural communities in Illinois are seeking to disassociate themselves from progressive Chicago and join neighboring red state Indiana. For decades, Staten Island has sought to secede from New York City, and despite a 2-to-1 vote by the residents to secede, the measure was quashed by New York State's Democratic Party.

Comedian Dave Chappelle ends show with ‘Free Palestine’ slogan	Comedian and actor Dave Chappelle accuses Saturday Night Live of barring him from talking about the situation in the Gaza Strip, ends stand-up comedy show by declaring 'Give the Jews a break, free Palestine.' By World Israel News Staff Stand-up comedian and actor Dave Chappelle accused the producers of Saturday Night Live of censoring him during his recent appearance on the show, barring him from discussing the situation in the Gaza Strip. During a stand-up comedy show in San Francisco last week, the 51-year-old said that he had been explicitly warned ahead of his January 18th appearance on SNL not to raise either Gaza or transgenderism, SFGate reported. Nevertheless, Chappelle did allude to the former during his monologue on the show. 'Do not forget your humanity, and please have empathy for displaced people whether they’re in the Palisades or Palestine,' Chappelle said. During last week's show in San Francisco, Chappelle made a more explicit political appeal on the issue, ending his show with the declaration: 'Give the Jews a break, free Palestine.' Chappelle, a convert to Islam, has in the past accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. Last May, during the IDF's ground operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, Chappelle had the song 'My Blood is Palestinian' by Mohammed Assaf played during a show in Abu Dhabi. As the audience began to chant 'Free Palestine,' Chappelle responded by calling Israel's war in Gaza an act of 'genocide.' In October 2023, shortly after the Hamas invasion of Israel, a number of audience members jeered Chappelle, with some leaving the event hall, after the comedian accused Israel of war crimes and slammed the Israeli government for initially closing off Israeli-supplied water and electricity to the Gaza Strip.

Elimination of Hamas still 2 years away, Israeli envoy says	Israel's New York consul-general said Israel will never accept a ‘terror state' in Gaza or Judea and Samaria, and knows it has full U.S. backing. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel’s consul-general in New York, Ofir Akunis, said that it will take another year or two to eliminate Hamas, and that the government knows it has full U.S. backing to reject a 'terror state' right on its borders, The New York Post reported Saturday. In an interview last week, the paper said, Akunis had compared the fight against Hamas to World War II. 'It will take time. We can stop [the war] after Hamas is not there — maybe it will take another year or two years. It took six years, six years for the Western world, to defeat Germany,' he observed. Akunis specifically mentioned that there were 'hundreds of miles' of terror tunnels still left under major portions of the Gaza Strip, that needed to be blocked up or destroyed. Leaving the majority in place through lack of choice, the IDF focused on blowing up only the most strategic tunnels while fighting the terrorist forces in the coastal enclave over 15 months of warfare, until a ceasefire went into effect last month. Akunis did not say that Israel would end the ceasefire and go back to fighting to get rid of Hamas, although U.S. President Donald Trump had given Israel the green light to do so last week. He did state that if the war does resume, it would 'look different' than before, without providing details. Israel knows it has full American backing with the current administration to do whatever would be necessary, the consul-general said, while making a point of praising Trump’s revolutionary idea to remove all the Gazans to other countries while the U.S. rebuilds the enclave. 'All of the international community must be open to new ideas,' he said of the reconstruction project, which could take a decade or more. With the exception so far of the UAE, the proposal has been generally rejected by the Arab world as well as several European countries, which have accused Trump of wanting to 'ethnically cleanse' Gaza and keep insisting that it must be part of a future Palestinian state. Israeli officials who enthusiastically support the incipient plan have said that Palestinians would be allowed to return but only if they believed in peaceful coexistence with the Jewish state. Akunis, a member of the Likud party, also made clear that he does not believe in giving the Palestinians a state of their own, especially after what Hamas did as rulers of the Strip over the last two decades. 'Gaza was a Palestinian state,' he noted. 'Do you think that the Israelis should accept the idea of the same terror state in Judea and Samaria and in the Gaza Strip again? The answer is no.'

Two Israeli-Arabs planning attacks for Hamas arrested	Investigators believe the brothers were preparing for a 'military confrontation' against Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Two brothers from the Israeli Arab city of Arraba were arrested and indicted for preparing to carry out a terror attack for Hamas, it was cleared for publication on Monday. The suspects, Yusef and Hadi Nasser, are accused of acquiring military equipment and learning to build explosive devices in preparation for a terror attack, the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) said. Investigators believe the brothers were preparing for a 'military confrontation' against Israel. This case is part of a broader effort by security forces to thwart attacks inspired by Hamas since the war began. Multiple investigations have been launched against Israeli citizens suspected of supporting terrorist activities. 'The General Security Service and the Israel Police view with great seriousness any involvement of Israeli citizens in activities that endanger the security of the state, and will continue to take the measures at their disposal to thwart any threat and act to bring all those involved to justice,' the Shin Bet said. The Haifa District Attorney’s Office has now filed indictments against the two for preparation for an act of terrorism, as well as training and instruction for terrorist purposes.

Cannabis brings relief to growing number of trauma victims post O...	Approximately 20,000 Israelis are already using medical cannabis for PTSD, representing 15% of the country’s medical cannabis prescriptions. By Jewish Breaking News As thousands of new PTSD cases emerge in the wake of October 7, promising research on cannabis treatment for trauma survivors has taken on new urgency. Following combat veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD, researchers at Tel Aviv University found significant symptom improvement in patients using medical cannabis, with more than 65% experiencing at least a 20% reduction in their PTSD symptoms. Notably, participants showed marked improvements in sleep quality and duration, along with reductions in intrusive thoughts and hyperarousal symptoms. Research shows that PTSD patients often have lower levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) that help regulate stress and emotional memories. THC, the primary active ingredient in cannabis, helps improve sleep quality, reduce nightmares, and lower anxiety in most cases. CBD, the non-intoxicating compound, reduces anxiety, counters potential negative effects of THC, and has calming properties. Together, they target brain areas involved in fear, memory, and stress response. 'What we’re seeing is particularly relevant given the current crisis,' Dr. Segal of medical cannabis producer Panaxia tells Globes. 'We see that this is a treatment that helps patients escape rather than resolve trauma, but that relief is also very important.' Approximately 20,000 Israelis are already using medical cannabis for PTSD, representing 15% of the country’s medical cannabis prescriptions. While the research shows promise, experts emphasize caution. Dr. Gilad Bodenheimer, head of mental health services at Israel’s Ministry of Health, cautions that it 'has not been proven to be a substance that is effective for PTSD,' adding that careful consideration is needed when prescribing any substance with potential risks. The brutal reality of October 7 has left thousands scarred for life, creating a mental health crisis of historic proportions. While no research can fully address trauma of this magnitude, the study’s findings about cannabis treatment offer at least a glimmer of hope for Israel’s traumatized survivors.

Hamas reportedly willing to hand over Gaza to Palestinian Authori...	Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas meets World Jewish Congress leader, pushing bid for Ramallah to take control over the Gaza Strip after Hamas reportedly agrees to cede the area. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization has agreed to yield control over the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian Authority, according to unnamed sources cited by Sky News Arabia in a report published Sunday night. The sources claimed that Hamas had told government employees in the Gaza Strip that they will be 're-absorbed into the new administration,' run by the Palestinian Authority, 'or that they would retire, with a guarantee that their salaries be paid.' Hamas is said to have agreed to surrender control over the coastal enclave to Ramallah following intense pressure from Egypt. The Egyptian government is said to have pressed a Hamas delegation during its recent trip to Cairo, in a bid to secure an alternative to President Donald Trump's plan to resettle the entire population in third-party countries, including Egypt and Jordan. The Palestinian Authority is also working to promote its rule of Gaza as an alternative to the Trump plan. On Sunday, Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas met with World Jewish Congress President Ron Lauder in Amman, Jordan. During their meeting, the PA mouthpiece WAFA reported, Abbas reiterated his opposition to the Trump plan, as well as to any possible transfer or mass migration of Arabs out of Judea and Samaria. Instead, Abbas argued, Ramallah should be charged with governing the post-war Gaza Strip, and called for increased international humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as well as aid to rebuild the coastal enclave. The Gaza Strip was administered by the Palestinian Authority from 1994, after Israel withdrew from parts of the Strip, until Hamas seized the area in 2007, defeating Fatah loyalists.

Eyal Zamir confirmed as Israeli military’s Chief of Staff	The last time chief of staff to leave the post before the end of his term was Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz, who resigned in 2007 over IDF failures during the Second Lebanon War of 2006. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli government gave its approval for the appointment of Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir as the next Israel Defense Forces chief of staff on Sunday. Zamir will replace Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, who announced on Jan. 21 he would resign over the military’s October 7 failures. Halevi is due to step down on March 5. Zamir, 59, was born and raised in Eilat. He would become the Chief of Staff to begin his career in the Armored Corps. After joining the army in 1984 he became a tank commander, gradually climbing the ranks. He was eventually appointed as Netanyahu’s military secretary from 2012-2015. From 2018 to 2021, he was deputy chief of staff before becoming a visiting research fellow at the Washington-based Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Zamir was also considered for the Chief of Staff in 2018 and 2022. In 2023, he was appointed Director General of the Defense Ministry. He also has degrees from Tel Aviv and Haifa Universities and is a graduate of Wharton University’s General Management Program. The IDF Chief of Staff serves for three years with the possibility of a one-year extension. The last time chief of staff to leave the post before the end of his term was Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz, who resigned in 2007 over IDF failures during the Second Lebanon War of 2006. There have been growing calls for the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to investigate political and military failures. Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. They may include personal recommendations about individuals under investigation, though the government is not bound to act on the recommendations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the governing coalition say an independent commission should only be appointed after the war. The last state commission of inquiry, which investigated Israel’s worst civilian disaster — a stampede that killed 45 people at a holy site on Mount Meron — held Netanyahu personally responsible for the tragedy in a report released in April.

Despairing of rescue, hostage prayed girlfriend would move on	Sasha Troufanov, released on Saturday, did not believe he’d survive Hamas captivity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Sapir Cohen, the partner of Sasha Troufanov who was freed on Saturday, told a press gathering Sunday night at Sheba Hospital that he had he had prayed she’d find someone else as he never expected to survive. 'Sasha told me that he prayed for me, that I would find a man I love, that I would not wait for him,' she relayed, voice shaking. 'He did not want me to wait for a man who would never come home. He did not believe that he would come out alive.' Troufanov spent his entire captivity alone, almost all of it in tunnels under Khan Yunis, where he was sometimes left chained in the dark. He was starved, and abused both physically and mentally. Cohen, whom Hamas terrorists had abducted along with Troufanov and his mother and grandmother from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7, 2023 invasion, said that since that day she has managed to 'fulfill dreams I never thought I’d have – to return alive from captivity in Gaza and to hug Sasha again.' The three women were released in the first hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, some seven weeks into the war, when 82 female and underage Israelis were freed over the course of a week in exchange for a temporary ceasefire, 246 Palestinian prisoners, and humanitarian aid that has flowed into the Strip ever since. Cohen thanked all the troops who fought in Gaza, and the families of the fallen, saying that 'to call you soldiers is to minimize what you do, a thousand-fold. You are role models who show what unity is, what solidarity is. Thank you for showing us that this is possible.' She also expressed special gratitude to everyone who gave strength and hope to the hostages’ families, 'each in their own way,' saying that she 'thanked God every day for the privilege I was given to meet so many good people.' Troufanov’s mother, Yelena, whose husband was murdered by Hamas terrorists on October 7, said, 'I feel like I have received my life, my soul, my heart back' with her son’s return, calling it a 'miracle' that although he’d been shot in both legs when he was abducted, he could stand and walk. Avital Dekel-Chen, wife of Sagui who was freed along with Troufanov, told the gathered journalists that her husband 'did not see daylight since October 7,' and didn’t know what had happened to his family until the day before he was released. He managed to hold on and not give up hope, she said, 'thanks to love.' But it was extremely hard to survive for nearly 17 months, she said, relaying that he had told her, 'It's nice that they write 498 days, but basically it's more correct to say that we've been there for over 43 million seconds of hell.' 'They don't count days or hours, they count seconds,' she emphasized. All the family members who spoke said it was of the utmost importance for all the rest of the hostages to be freed, no matter the cost. Hamas is still holding 73 captives, 35 of whom are known to be dead. Three of them have been held in Gaza for a decade or more: Two mentally ill young men, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who wandered into the Strip in 2014 and 2015 respectively, and Hadar Goldin, a soldier killed in 2014’s Operation Protective Edge, whose body was stolen. The two who are alive are on the list to be freed in the last part of Phase 1 of the current hostage deal.

Israel hits Hezbollah rocket launchers, weapons in Lebanon	Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri announced on Thursday that Beirut rejects Israel’s plan to maintain a presence in five locations in Southern Lebanon after this Tuesday’s ceasefire expiration date (Feb. 18). By JNS The Israeli Air Force on Sunday evening carried out strikes on multiple Hezbollah sites in Lebanon housing rocket launchers and weapons, according to the Israeli military. The Israel Defense Forces emphasized that the presence of terrorist infrastructure at these locations violated agreements between Jerusalem and Beirut, and stated that Israel remains committed to neutralizing any threats to its security. An IAF strike in Southern Lebanon on Saturday night killed Hezbollah operative Abbas Ahmad Hamoud, who was responsible for overseeing the Iranian-backed terror group’s aerial force.

Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri announced on Thursday that Beirut rejects Israel’s plan to maintain a presence in five locations in Southern Lebanon after this Tuesday’s ceasefire expiration date (Feb. 18). According to Berri, the United States, acting as a mediator, informed him that Israel would withdraw from certain villages but intended to remain in five strategic points. Berri, an ally of Hezbollah, stated that he had conveyed Lebanon’s complete rejection of this proposal on behalf of Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. Under the ceasefire agreement, Israeli forces are to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon as the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) assume responsibility for ensuring Hezbollah remains disarmed south of the Litani River. However, there has been growing concern in Jerusalem regarding the LAF’s ability to effectively curb Hezbollah’s presence. In response, the IDF continues frequent border operations to prevent the group from regaining strength, including intelligence gathering, reconnaissance and clearing terrain to disrupt terrorist movements. The ceasefire, which took effect on Nov. 27, mandated an Israeli withdrawal within 60 days. However, the U.S.-monitored arrangement between Lebanon and Israel is set to continue until Feb. 18, according to a White House statement on Jan. 26.

Report: UNRWA illegally operational in Jerusalem	On Oct. 28, the Knesset passed, by large majorities, two laws banning UNRWA following the exposure of UNRWA staff complicity in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, and despite pressure from the United States under former president Joe Biden. By JNS The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains operational in eastern Jerusalem despite its outlawing there and throughout Israel last month, an Israeli radio station reported on Sunday. Senior UNRWA staff have left Israel and Judea and Samaria because the outlawing of the agency risked compromising their freedom of movement, Kan 11 reported. The organization’s two headquarters in Jerusalem have also closed down. But schools and other UNRWA facilities in eastern Jerusalem and beyond remain open and operational, according to the report. Laws that ban UNRWA in Israel went into effect on Jan. 30, making it illegal for UNRWA to maintain a presence or activities in Israel and prohibiting Israeli officials from engaging in contact with the agency. 'This is inconceivable,' Shai Glick, CEO of the right-wing human rights group b’Tsalmo wrote on X. 'We will physically come there and close the place down no matter what happens! We will not allow terrorism free range in Jerusalem,' he added. On Oct. 28, the Knesset passed, by large majorities, two laws banning UNRWA following the exposure of UNRWA staff complicity in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, and despite pressure from the United States under former president Joe Biden. The language of the ban was by far the most robust ever used by Israel against the agency, whose largest donors have been the United States and the European Union. UNRWA has for decades been accused of providing cover and income to Palestinian terrorists while undermining peace efforts, including via its schools’ curriculum. According to Israel, hundreds of UNRWA workers have engaged in terrorism in recent years, including the killers of Yonatan Samerano, an Israeli soldier slain on Oct. 7, 2023, whose body was taken to Gaza. Israel identified one of his kidnappers as UNRWA social worker Faisal Ali Mussalem al Naami. On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump temporarily suspended U.S. foreign aid to UNRWA, pending reviews of existing development programs. UNRWA caters to several millions of people it defines as refugees in Judea and Samaria, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Through UNRWA, the United Nations employs a unique refugee definition for Palestinians. UNRWA defines as refugees not only those who fled the war in 1948 but their descendants in perpetuity until a 'just solution' emerges for their status. The United Nations has a different definition for all other refugees, who cannot give the title to their descendants and often lose it when they are naturalized elsewhere. Critics of the UNRWA definition argue that it’s designed to perpetuate the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

Netanyahu rules out alternatives to Trump’s Gaza plan	Trump has presented 'the only plan that can work,' says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, emphasizing desire of Palestinian Arabs to leave the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lobbied on behalf of President Donald Trump's Gaza resettlement plan on Sunday, urging American Jewish leaders to back the proposal to find new homes for the roughly two million Gazans currently living in the coastal enclave. On Sunday evening, Netanyahu addressed the Conference of Major American Jewish Organizations, lauding President Trump's policies vis-a-vis Israel, while touting Israel's accomplishments in the 15-month war on Hamas. Working with the Trump administration, Netanyahu vowed to 'change' the Middle East, continuing the transformation begun after October 7th. 'Within a year and some months, the courage of our soldiers, the stalwart position of our people and the decisions that we made turned things around. We decimated much of Hamas,' Netanyahu said. 'We haven't finished the job, we will. Israel will destroy Hamas' military and governing capabilities; Gaza will look differently.' 'We changed the Middle East,' Netanyahu continued. 'Now comes President Trump, and Secretary Rubio, who's a great friend of Israel as well. I've seen him over the years, and we had a great discussion today. And we talked about how do we complete the change in the Middle East.' 'We have the greatest friend of Israel in the White House now. We have, we see eye to eye on the main tasks that we have to accomplish, and we're in a position to change the Middle East and give Israel the kind of horizon, the kind of hope, the kind of security and the kind of peace that would have been unimaginable, and in fact was unimaginable from the day of the founding of the State of Israel.' The Israeli premier said Israel is on the cusp of 'victories' greater than any before in its history, including the Six Day War. 'We intend to pursue them to the full.' Trump's proposal to resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip in third-party countries, Netanyahu said, is a 'bold new vision and the only plan that I think can work.' Defending Trump's plan from accusations of ethnic cleansing, Netanyahu argued that most Gazans want to leave the Gaza Strip. 'Why not give Gazans a choice? Everybody said this is the largest open-air prison in the world. Not because of us. We let people leave.' 'In fact, if you want to know, over the last couple of years, two years I think, 150,000 Gazans left. You know how they left? Because they bribed their way out, not through us. They bribed their way out.' 'The rich could leave, but if other people wanted to leave, give them a choice, not forcible eviction, not ethnic cleansing. In a war zone people leave.' 'We tried to get the population to leave, to get them out of harm's way, and Hamas, with rifles, with gunfire, tried to prevent them from leaving. So we moved them around so that they would get out of harm's way. But if people want to leave, if they want to emigrate, it's their choice. And I think President Trump's plan is right on the dot.'

Trump to Netanyahu: ‘Do whatever you want’ in Gaza	After Hamas flouts his ultimatum, releasing just three hostages over the weekend, President Trump says Israel has discretion how to respond. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump gave Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a green light to take whatever course of action Israel deems necessary against the Hamas terror organization, after Hamas ignored Trump's ultimatum last week. Speaking at the Daytona 500 on Sunday, the president noted that while Hamas had not released all the remaining hostages on Saturday as he had demanded last week, three hostages - including a dual Israeli-American citizen - were returned to Israel. 'Now, the reason I made that statement was because [Hamas] said they weren't going to deliver, they were not going to deliver the people that they said they were going to deliver, that they agreed to deliver,' Trump explained. 'When I made the statement, they delivered everybody plus an American.' 'Now, the good news is they look like they're in pretty good shape because the people from the week before didn't look like they were in good shape. They looked like Holocaust survivors, frankly. Horrible. Whatever happened to them was horrible.' Last week, after Hamas threatened to delay the release of hostages slated for return to Israel on Saturday, Trump warned that 'all hell is going to break out' if Hamas does not free all remaining hostages by noon on Saturday. Netanyahu threatened to resume the war in the Gaza Strip if Hamas did not release Israeli hostages, but did not specify how many Israel would need to avert a return to the war. In his statement on Sunday, Trump said it would be 'up to Israel' to respond to the limited hostage release, adding that Netanyahu can 'do whatever you want' with regards to the war in Gaza. 'That will be up to Israel, what the next step is - in consultation with me,' Trump said. 'I told Bibi, you do whatever you want because, you know, my statement was they've got to come back.'

‘We won’t fight for surrender deals’ – IDF soldiers slam Gaza tru...	There is no moral justification for sending us to risk our lives on land that will later be handed over to the enemy,' wrote the soldiers. By World Israel News Staff A group of Israeli soldiers blasted the current ceasefire in Gaza, writing in an open letter to IDF leadership that they were demotivated by the decision to pause the fight against the Hamas terror group. The soldiers, reservists from the Northern Command's Carmeli Brigade, which was stationed in Gaza for a significant part of the Israel-Hamas war, wrote of their frustration with the decision to strike a deal with Hams. 'We do not want to be cannon fodder for deals of surrender,' the soldiers wrote, referring to the current ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement, according to a copy of the letter obtained by KAN News. The soldiers also stressed the importance of seizing land from Hamas, including the creation of a permanent buffer zone in Gaza, in order to protect Israeli civilians. 'How can we have the motivation to return, fight, and risk our lives in operational activities on land that will be handed back to our enemy in a few days? We're not ready to go home, either disabled [from battle wounds] or in coffins, when all our efforts will only serve as leverage for deals to release terrorists,' they added. The soldiers said they were proud to go into battle with the mission of securing a decisive victory over Hamas, but warned that they would be far less willing to put their lives on the line if their efforts would only lead to further prisoner exchanges and concessions towards the terror group. 'We are ready to stand and risk our lives again and again if we know for certain that the purpose of our stand is to fight, defeat, and vanquish the enemy,' they wrote. But, they emphasized, 'there is no moral justification for sending us to risk our lives on land that will later be handed over to the enemy.'

Day 500 of the war: IDF casualties by the numbers	Since October 7th, 2023, 894 members of the security forces, including soldiers, police officers, and members of intelligence agencies, have been killed in combat. By World Israel News Staff Thousands of Israeli security personnel are grappling with physical and mental injuries sustained in the ongoing war, according to a new report from Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv. The report, which leveraged data obtained from the Israeli army and the Defense Ministry’s Rehabilitation Department, revealed the staggering toll of the fighting, which began with Hamas' October 7th, 2023, terror onslaught. Since that day, 894 members of the security forces, including soldiers, police officers, and members of intelligence agencies, have been killed in combat. Approximately 15,000 have been wounded, with that number including both those physically injured and suffering from debilitating mental issues. According to the report, some 8,600 were wounded physically, and 7,600 are facing psychological challenges, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. The statistics indicated that there is a significant number of security forces who sustained both physical and mental injuries simultaneously. Notably, 66 percent of those wounded in combat are reserve soldiers, compared to 17 percent being combat soldiers performing their mandatory service. 10 percent of those wounded were police officers, many of whom sprang into action on October 7th with little training or arms relevant for the scale of the battles. Half of those wounded were between the ages of 18 to 29, with an additional 30 percent aged between 30 to 39. The remaining 20 percent of casualties were age 40 and older. A recent report from the State Comptroller warned that Israel must do more to support traumatized soldiers and civilians, who are also facing mental health challenges after some 15 months of war. The government 'has not done enough to address the anticipated mental health challenges,' the report states, adding that 'no fewer than 3 million Israelis may develop symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD as a result of the war.'

Teacher tells students: Blame Netanyahu for hostage deal issues	Civics teacher says that Netanyahu, not Hamas, is at fault for missed opportunities to secure a hostage deal. By World Israel News Staff The Education Ministry has opened an investigation into a high school teacher who told her students that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, not Hamas, is at fault for the challenges around the completion of the current ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. In a recording made by a student in the classroom, which was leaked to Channel 14 News, the civics teacher from the central city of Ra'anana - whose name has not been publicly revealed - is heard telling students that they are mistaken if they believe Netanyahu is prioritizing freeing the hostages. When a student said that Netanyahu is attempting to bring back the hostages, the teacher is heard saying, 'Is he really trying?' After the student pushed back and said that the premier is trying to secure the captives' freedom, the teacher replied that 'according to everything we know, he's not trying.' The teacher added that 'as of right now, there was no deal that [Netanyahu] didn't blow up.' Numerous students responded by telling the teacher that it was Hamas, not Netanyahu, who had sabotaged opportunities for a deal. 'You all really believe that it was Hamas?' the teacher is heard asking incredulously, implying that they were naive for believing that the terror group is less trustworthy than the prime minister. In additional recordings, the teacher can be heard falsely claiming that Communications Minister Shloma Karai had called for the murder of Attorney Gali Baharav Miara. While Karai has been critical of Barharav Miara, he has never called for her killing. 'As stated, this is an extremely serious incident. Injecting political propaganda and fostering social divisions in the classroom directly contradicts the ministry's values, procedures, and the minister's directives,' the Education Ministry said in a media statement. 'It is important to note that the teacher denies the allegations, and we have not yet received the recordings documenting the incident. The matter will be thoroughly investigated and addressed significantly, based on the findings.' Several hours later, Education Minister Yoav Kisch made an additional comment to Channel 14 News after listening to the recordings. 'I was shocked by the teacher's remarks,' Kisch said, promising the outlet that his ministry is handling the incident with the utmost seriousness. 'The days of spreading hatred and division under the auspices of the education system are over,' he added.

Trump gives Iran a deadline to close its nuclear program	The United States is actively seeking direct and confidential negotiations with Iran, according to the same diplomatic source. By JBN The clock is ticking for Iran to shut down its nuclear program. 'The Trump administration is trying to reach an agreement with Iran before October. However, if this agreement is not achieved, the region will face a serious crisis,' a European diplomat tells Dubai based Al-Hadath. But behind the scenes, American officials are pushing for a diplomatic solution. The United States is actively seeking direct and confidential negotiations with Iran, according to the same diplomatic source. 'Maybe they are trying to get new defense as we speak but their defense is largely gone… Iran is very nervous. I think they’re scared. I would love to make a deal with them without bombing them,' Trump stated during a recent Fox News appearance. 'Everybody thinks Israel with our help or our approval will go in and bomb the hell out of them,' he said. 'I would prefer that not happen. I’d much rather see a deal with Iran where we can do a deal, supervise, check it, inspect it.' Despite dismissing rumors of joint military action with Israel, Trump is tightening the economic screws. On February 4, he signed an executive order reviving his 'maximum pressure policy' aimed at strangling Iran’s oil exports. Once bolstered by sophisticated Russian air defense systems, Iran now finds itself exposed after Israeli strikes last October reportedly destroyed its remaining S-300 missile installations. Tehran has categorically denied any such reports. 'The reality is that in war, clashes happen. But the idea that our defense system has weakened or, as some ignorant individuals say, has been destroyed, is absolutely false,' said Brigadier General Mahdi Farahi as quoted by Iran International. 'Our defense system, in terms of deployment, diversity, and capabilities, has not only not weakened but has become even stronger since before the Zionist regime’s aggression.' Meanwhile, Iran’s nuclear ambitions are becoming an increasingly open topic of discussion within the country. The shift became apparent in late October 2024 after the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ newspaper made waves by calling for Iran to rethink its nuclear strategy, citing Israel’s use of 'devastating military technology to establish a new order.' The debate spread quickly. A week later, 39 members of parliament sent a letter to the Supreme National Security Council pushing for the same reassessment.

Doctors give Netanyahu a clean bill of health in spite of recent ...	His medical team stressed that there is no indication of prostate cancer and that the tissue removed during the recent surgery in December was benign. By Pesach Benson, TPS A recently published document has provided details on the medical condition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, following a year of multiple medical procedures. The document marks the first full medical report on the 75-year-old Prime Minister’s health since 2016. The document, which outlines Netanyahu’s medical history and current condition, is not an official government health report but rather a summary compiled by his personal medical team. According to the report signed by the Prime Minister’s private physician, Dr. Zvi Berkowitz along with Prof. Alon Pikarsky and Prof. Ehud Grossman, Netanyahu is in good health. His blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels are within normal ranges, and comprehensive laboratory tests, including kidney and liver function assessments, showed no abnormalities. The report confirmed that Netanyahu has been undergoing routine colonoscopy screenings, with the latest results indicating no abnormalities. His medical team stressed that there is no indication of prostate cancer and that the tissue removed during the recent surgery in December was benign. The procedure led to a two-week pause in Netanyahu’s corruption trial. Despite the ongoing urinary infection, his doctors assert that his overall health remains stable and that he is receiving appropriate treatment. The medical report noted that Netanyahu underwent a pacemaker implantation in July 2023 due to a conduction block. According to Prof. Roy Beinert, director of the Institute for Arrhythmias at Sheba Medical Center, Netanyahu has not shown signs of heart rhythm disturbances since the procedure and is not dependent on the pacemaker. Regular cardiological evaluations have determined that the device is functioning properly and that Netanyahu is stable from a cardiac standpoint, requiring only routine monitoring. In April 2024, Netanyahu underwent surgery to repair a right inguinal hernia. Prior to the procedure, a full-body CT scan revealed an enlarged prostate, small stones in the bladder, and an obstructive bladder disorder. Subsequently, on December 29, 2024, he underwent laser surgery to remove benign prostate tissue. His doctors noted that the surgery went as expected, though he has been dealing with a persistent urinary tract infection since the procedure. He remains on antibiotic treatment, and his doctors have recommended a gradual return to full activity. Following the prostate surgery, Netanyahu made headlines when he left the Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center over the objections of his doctors to personally cast his vote over the 'Trapped Profits Law.' It passed by a vote of 59-58. Netanyahu was accompanied by Berkowitz in the Knesset plenum. Itamar Ben-Gvir subsequently apologized to Netanyahu and MK Boaz Bismuth, who was forced to interrupt a week of mourning for his mother to cast his vote. Failure to pass the bill could have jeopardized approval of the state budget later, or potentially create a 10-billion-shekel deficit ($2.74 billion).

Arab Countries announce 5 year Gaza reconstruction plan without H...	The plan provides for reconstruction over three to five years, without the displacement of the Palestinian population and without Hamas control. The Algemeiner and i24 News Arab countries will unveil their plan for the reconstruction of Gaza on February 27 in Cairo. This initiative, developed by the Palestinians and handed over to the Egyptians for implementation, will be presented to the leaders of Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. The plan provides for reconstruction over three to five years, without the displacement of the Palestinian population and without Hamas control. The funding, estimated at several hundred million dollars, will come from Gulf countries. The work will be carried out by Egyptian companies, representing a significant source of income for Egypt, which is strongly opposed to any migration of Palestinians out of Gaza. The workforce will consist mainly of local Palestinians. 'The goal is to marginalize Hamas so that it understands that it has lost control of Gaza, and to completely eliminate the terrorist organization’s grip on the population and the territory within 5 years from the start of reconstruction,' a source involved in the plan said. An independent 'Palestinian administration,' separate from the Palestinian Authority but relying on it, will oversee the reconstruction. This power structure is designed to get the approval of Israel and the United States, who refuse direct management by the Palestinian Authority. Arab countries fear a resurgence of fighting by Israel, which could, in their view, favor US President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians to neighboring countries. The former US president said he wanted to see Jordan, Egypt, and other Arab countries welcome more displaced people from Gaza, so that the war-torn area can be 'cleaned up.' According to analyzed satellite images, approximately 65% of the buildings in Gaza have been destroyed during the war. Experts estimate that reconstruction could take more than a decade and cost several hundred billion dollars.

Vance lambasted European leaders on Friday, accusing them of censoring free speech and criticizing German mainstream parties’ 'firewall' against the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). By Reuters and Algemeiner Staff German Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a strong rebuke on Saturday to US Vice President JD Vance’s attack on Europe’s stance toward hate speech and the far right, saying it was not right for others to tell Germany and Europe what to do. Vance lambasted European leaders on Friday, the first day of the Munich Security Conference, accusing them of censoring free speech and criticizing German mainstream parties’ 'firewall' against the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). 'That is not appropriate, especially not among friends and allies. We firmly reject that,' Scholz told the conference on Saturday, adding there were 'good reasons' not to work with the AfD. The anti-immigration party, currently polling at around 20% ahead of Germany’s February 23 national election, has pariah status among other major German parties in a country with a taboo about ultranationalist politics because of its Nazi past. 'Never again fascism, never again racism, never again aggressive war. That is why an overwhelming majority in our country opposes anyone who glorifies or justifies criminal National Socialism,' Scholz said, referring to the ideology of Adolf Hitler’s 1933-45 Nazi regime. Vance met on Friday with the leader of AfD, after endorsing the party as a political partner — a stance Berlin dismissed as unwelcome election interference. Referring more broadly to Vance’s criticism of Europe’s curtailing of hate speech, which he has likened to censorship, Scholz said: 'Today’s democracies in Germany and Europe are founded on the historic awareness and realization that democracies can be destroyed by radical anti-democrats. 'And this is why we’ve created institutions that ensure that our democracies can defend themselves against their enemies, and rules that do not restrict or limit our freedom but protect it.' French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot added his voice to the defense of Europe’s stance on hate speech. 'No one is required to adopt our model but no one can impose theirs on us,' Barrot said on X from Munich. 'Freedom of speech is guaranteed in Europe.' UKRAINE The prospect of talks to end the Ukraine-Russia war had been expected to dominate the annual Munich conference after a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, but Vance barely mentioned Russia or Ukraine in his speech to the gathering on Friday. Instead, he said the threat to Europe that worried him most was not Russia or China but what he called a retreat from fundamental values of protecting free speech – as well as immigration, which he said was 'out of control' in Europe. Many conference delegates watched Vance’s speech in stunned silence. There was little applause as he delivered his remarks. Asked by the panel moderator if he thought there was anything in Vance’s speech worth reflecting on, Scholz drew laughter and applause in the crowd when he responded, in a deadpan manner: 'You mean all these very relevant discussions about Ukraine and security in Europe?'

Israel’s UN Ambassador Leiter says Egypt’s military buildup will ...	Egypt has constructed military bases in Sinai 'that can only be used for offensive operations, for offensive weapons—that’s a clear violation,' said Leiter. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter has accused Egypt of 'very serious' violations of its 45-year-old peace treaty with the Jewish state, saying the government in Jerusalem would table Cairo’s military buildup in Sinai 'very soon.' Egypt has constructed military bases in Sinai 'that can only be used for offensive operations, for offensive weapons—that’s a clear violation,' Leiter said in his first meeting with American Jewish organizations on Jan. 28, a recording of which was shared online by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations on Friday. Egypt’s breach 'is an issue that is going to come to the fore because it’s not tolerable,' the Israeli diplomatic envoy explained. 'For a long time, it’s been shunted aside, and this continues. This is going to be an issue that we’re going to put on the table very soon and very emphatically.' Satellite images indicating changes in Egyptian army deployment in the Sinai Peninsula have reportedly led security coordinators in Israeli border towns to paint a worrying picture of recent developments. IDF Lt. Col. (res.) Eliyahu Dekel, who has monitored Cairo’s adherence to the peace deal since it was signed in 1979, told Israel Hayom last week that 'if the latest images are verified, the concern isn’t just about forces in Sinai, the key issue is the type of tanks. The images show Abrams tanks, which are Egypt’s premier battle tanks, reserved for elite units. 'The question arises: What are these special forces doing in Sinai? In recent years, three new airfields have been built in Sinai, and massive tunnels have been dug, blatantly violating the peace treaty. The treaty allows for military camps for 47 battalions; currently, there are camps for 180 battalions, four times the permitted amount.' In recent days, Cairo’s official rhetoric has escalated in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for relocating Palestinians from Gaza. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has made clear that he will not allow the move to happen, even postponing a planned visit to the White House. In his speech to the Conference of Presidents, Leiter said Sisi 'plays both sides of the equation, but he is threatened by the Muslim Brotherhood.' If the Israeli military decisively defeats the Muslim Brotherhood branch in the Gaza Strip—Hamas—Sisi is 'going to be more open to cooperate with us on the ‘day after’ Hamas,' he argued. The Israeli envoy called it 'unconscionable that Egypt wouldn’t entertain the possibility of at least temporarily housing some of the [Palestinian] refugees, particularly in light of the fact that members of Sisi’s family are running a travel agency in which they take tens of thousands of dollars from Gazans who want to get out of the area.' On Sunday, Sisi told World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder that the establishment of a Palestinian state in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip is 'the only guarantee' for lasting peace in the Middle East. During the meeting with the Jewish leader in Cairo, Sisi called for the reconstruction of the war-torn Strip 'without displacing its residents from their land,' according to a statement published by his office. According to the readout from the Egyptian presidency, Lauder for his part praised Cairo’s 'wise efforts' to restore stability in the Middle East.

Israel in ‘full cooperation’ with Trump, say Netanyahu, Rubio	Netanyahu: 'We have a shared strategy, which cannot always be detailed to the public—including when the gates of hell will open. And they will open if all our hostages are not returned, every last one of them.' By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is working closely with President Donald Trump, according to a joint statement released on Sunday with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 'Contrary to what is being reported, President Trump and I are working in full cooperation and coordination,' the prime minister told Rubio, according to the statement. 'We have a shared strategy, which cannot always be detailed to the public—including when the gates of hell will open. And they will open if all our hostages are not returned, every last one of them,' it continued. According to a statement from his office on Saturday, Netanyahu will convene the Security Cabinet 'soon' to discuss Jerusalem’s response to Trump’s call for the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza to release all of the hostages it is holding. Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s commitment to securing the release of all hostages, dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities and eliminating the threat from Gaza. For his part, the top American diplomat stressed at a press conference alongside the Israeli premier that the Jewish state has had no stronger ally in the White House than Trump. Rubio emphasized that the hostages must be released and reiterated that Hamas cannot continue as a military or governing force in Gaza, saying that the terrorist group 'must be eliminated.' On Syria, he stressed that replacing one destabilizing force with another is not the solution. With regard to Lebanon, he stated that 'we share the same goal: a strong Lebanese state capable of disarming Hezbollah.' Rubio maintained that the ayatollahs’ regime in Tehran is the source of all the instability in the Middle East, saying that this must be addressed and stressing that Iran must never have nuclear weapons. He praised the Jewish state, saying, 'Founded after a horrifying crime against humanity, Israel stands as a beacon to the world. More nations like Israel in the Middle East would make the world safer,' adding that 'Israel seeks peace but won’t be intimidated by its enemies.' Netanyahu offered Rubio a warm welcome, saying it was 'great to welcome you to Jerusalem as secretary of state,' hailing Trump again as 'the greatest friend Israel has ever had at the White House,' and reflecting on his recent visit to Washington. Netanyahu said that he had had a 'very production discussion' with Rubio in a private meeting at his Jerusalem office before participating in an extended diplomatic exchange with their teams. Netanyahu emphasized that Iran was the No. 1 topic of the conversations. 'Israel and America stand shoulder to shoulder in countering the threat of Iran. We agreed that the ayatollahs must not have nuclear weapons,' said Netanyahu. 'We also agreed that Iran’s aggression in the region has to be rolled back,' adding that over the past 16 months, Israel 'has dealt a mighty blow to Iran’s terror axis. 'Under the strong leadership of President Trump and with your unflinching support, I have no doubt that we can and will finish the job,' he added. He thanked Trump for helping to secure the release of three more hostages on Saturday, after Hamas had earlier said they would not be freed on time. 'I also thanked him for America’s unequivocal backing for Israel’s policy in Gaza in moving forward,' said Netanyahu. Netanyahu also said he and Rubio had discussed Trump’s 'bold plan for Gaza' and how to make it a reality. Turning to Lebanon, Netanyahu called the weekend attacks on UNIFIL forces by Hezbollah supporters in Beirut 'concerning,' saying that Hezbollah must be disarmed and that 'Israel will take necessary measures to enforce the ceasefire and ensure its security.' He praised Trump for reinstating his executive order against the International Criminal Court and sanctioning its officials, saying that he discussed with Rubio countering threats from anti-American and anti-Israel international forums. Netanyahu said that he talked with Rubio 'about working together to formulate a common strategy to deal with the threat of lawfare and neutralize this threat once and for all. 'There are significant challenges and opportunities. By working together, America and Israel will overcome obstacles and capitalize on opportunities. The best is yet to come,' Netanyahu said. Rubio touched down in Israel on Saturday night for his first visit to the Jewish state since being confirmed as America’s top diplomat. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar greeted Rubio on the tarmac at Ben-Gurion International Airport. The two counterparts toured the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem on Sunday. Rubio and Sa’ar in their talks discussed strengthening ties with Abraham Accords countries, relocating embassies to Jerusalem, legal challenges to Israel’s self-defense, combating antisemitism, boosting U.S.-Israel economic relations, and implementing Trump’s 'connectivity' vision. They agreed to maintain open dialogue and plan Sa’ar’s visit to Washington soon. The American diplomat also met with other high-ranking officials, including President Isaac Herzog and opposition leader Yair Lapid. 'It’s an honor to be back as the secretary of state, not even four weeks into the job. I wanted this one to be one of our first visits because of the issues before us, and also because of the friendship and solidarity between our two countries,' Rubio said ahead of the meeting with Herzog. 'On behalf of the [U.S.] president, I can tell you he’s strongly and deeply committed to the goal of every single hostage returning home, every single one, and not resting, not being silent, not forgetting, till all of them our home,' according to Washington’s top diplomat. Herzog said, 'Shalom, our dear friend, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. We are honored to have you in our midst, in our country, you have no idea how much it means to us in these challenging days and times that our nation has gone through and endured since October 7, [2023]. 'We are grateful to President Donald Trump for his friendship and solidarity with the people of Israel and the State of Israel, and we are grateful for his direct involvement in bringing back our hostages,' he added. 'Secretary Rubio’s engagements with senior officials will promote U.S. interests in advancing regional cooperation, stability and peace,' State Department Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a press statement ahead of the visit. 'The trip will center on freeing American and all other hostages from Hamas captivity, advancing to Phase II of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, and countering the destabilizing activities of the Iranian regime and its proxies,' the statement continued. Rubio’s trip follows Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip, after which the coastal area would be turned over to American control for reconstruction. On Thursday, Rubio said in an interview that any plan allowing Hamas to rule Gaza would be unacceptable to Israel and ineffective in resolving the conflict. He added that Trump was willing to take the lead on rebuilding Gaza, as no other viable plans have been proposed. Rubio‘s trip also comes amid Israel’s ceasefire agreement with the Hamas terrorist group and the release of hostages held in the Strip. The truce is 'tenuous' because Hamas is a terrorist organization responsible for violence against civilians, Rubio told journalist Chris Cuomo by phone on NewsNation on Tuesday. The secretary of state on Monday described Hamas as an 'evil' and 'monstrous' organization that must be wiped out. 'This is an evil organization. Hamas is evil. It’s pure evil. These are monsters. These are savages. That’s a group that needs to be eradicated,' he said during an interview on talk radio channel SiriusXM Patriot. Rubio will also travel to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the next three days.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US President Donald Trump's plan for the US to take control of Gaza and allow its civilians to leave the area during the rebuilding process is 'absolutely legal,' according to international human rights lawyer Arsen Ostrovsky. In fact, Ostrovsky asserts that those violating international human rights law are the ones insisting that Gazan civilians must remain in Gaza. Speaking to ILTV News, he said, 'Einstein's famous quote is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. And for many, many years, including since October 7, the international community has had the same failing strategy with respect to Gaza, a strategy that essentially allows Hamas to remain in power, which we know is simply unacceptable.' Ostrovsky emphasized that Trump's plan would be legal as long as the transfer of civilians was not done by force, which would violate international law. Instead, Ostrovsky says he understands Trump's proposal as creating 'a set of circumstances and conditions to allow Gazans to voluntarily choose to move to better conditions elsewhere.' He added that those who insist that Gazans must stay in the Gaza Strip are, in fact, advocating for an inhumane and unsustainable situation. 'I would actually go one step further and suggest that those who insist the Gazans stay are perhaps the ones violating international law. By doing so, especially while Hamas remains in power, they're essentially forcing Gazans to stay in an active war zone and allowing them to be used as human shields by Hamas,' Ostrovsky said. During a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump unveiled his plan for the US to control Gaza and for the civilian population to relocate to Arab countries. Although the plan was welcomed by Israelis, heads of Arab nations have rejected it. The proposal involves collaborating with Arab states to accept refugees from Gaza while the area is reconstructed, a process that could take up to ten years.

IDF soldiers report that Hamas is planting explosives in the Gaza...	This report follows news from last week that Nukhba terrorists were driving pickup trucks near the buffer zone. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News IDF soldiers stationed in the security zone around Gaza report observing Hamas infrastructure crews working in the area and planting explosives. Israeli journalist Almog Boker interviewed soldiers who said terrorists are taking advantage of their access to the zone to lay explosives intended for Israelis. Upon hearing the report, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, 'The directive to the IDF is clear and unambiguous: Anyone who enters the Gaza buffer zone, whether on foot or in a vehicle, is putting their life at risk – and the IDF must respond accordingly.' 'We have a duty to protect IDF soldiers and the residents of southern Israel from every threat and danger, and we will not compromise on security. We will not return to the pre-October 7th reality,' he continued. This report follows news from last week that Nukhba terrorists were driving pickup trucks near the buffer zone, but the IDF's Southern Command refrained from shooting at them. The decision not to strike was based on the fact that the vehicles were merely approaching the zone, not inside it. In this case, the presence of terrorist vehicles outside the zone did not violate the ceasefire. Israel’s air force conducted an airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip on Sunday morning, despite an ongoing ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization in the coastal enclave. The strike was in response to what appeared to be an immediate threat posed by a group of armed Hamas terrorists spotted approaching an IDF position near the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza, which separates the Gaza Strip from Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. 'An Israel Air Force aircraft struck a group of armed men earlier today as they moved toward an IDF force in the southern Gaza Strip,' the IDF said Sunday morning. 'Several hits were identified.' The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claimed that three people were killed in the strike, with two others injured. The Palestinian Authority mouthpiece, WAFA, reported the increase in the death toll from two to three.

IDF airstrike during ceasefire kills 3 Hamas terrorists	Israeli Air Force bombs group of armed Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip as they approached an IDF army unit, leaving at least three terrorists dead, two injured. By World Israel News Staff Israel's air force carried out an airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip Sunday morning, despite an ongoing ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas terror organization in the coastal enclave. The strike was conducted in response to what was potentially an immediate threat posed by a group of armed Hamas terrorists spotted approaching an IDF position close to the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza which separates the Gaza Strip from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. 'An Israel Air Force aircraft struck a group of armed men earlier today as they moved towards an IDF force in the southern Gaza Strip,' the IDF said Sunday morning. 'Several hits were identified.' The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claimed that three people were killed in the strike, with two more injured, the Palestinian Authority mouthpiece WAFA reported, raising the death toll from two to three. Arabic media outlets in the Gaza Strip claimed that the three men killed were Hamas-affiliated police officers working to secure the flow of humanitarian aid from the Rafah crossing into Gaza. Later on Sunday, an IDF spokesperson announced that the Israeli military had foiled an attempt to smuggle weapons across the Egyptian border. During the incident, the IDF detected a drone aircraft which violated Israeli airspace, crossing over from Egypt in the Paran district. 'The drone aircraft was downed by an IDF force which arrived at the site and located the drone, which was carrying a gun and ammunition,' the IDF spokesperson said. 'The confiscated combat equipment were transferred to security forces for handling.'

Marco Rubio lands in Israel, meets with Netanyahu	US Secretary of State makes his first trip to Israel since taking office, meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as joint efforts to secure second phase of hostage deal continue. By World Israel News Staff United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio landed in Israel late Saturday night, kicking off his first visit to the Jewish state since he took office less than a month ago. Hours after touching down at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, Rubio met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem. Afterwards, the two leaders held a joint press conference, during which Netanyahu lauded Rubio as a 'champion' of Israel-U.S. relations. 'President Trump is the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House,' Netanyahu said. 'Your visit here reflects it in every way. Throughout your career you have been a great friend of Israel and a champion of the U.S.-Israel alliance. I have no doubt that your unwavering support will continue during your tenure as secretary of state.' Netanyahu also cited the Trump administration's 'unequivocal support' for Israel's policies in Gaza 'moving forward,' alluding to President Donald Trump's call to resettle the coastal enclave's population in third-party countries, and Trump's backing of Israel's right to resume fighting with Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli premier said that he and Rubio discussed, among other things 'Trump's bold vision for Gaza,' the situation in Syria following last year's coup which saw the ouster of President Bashar Assad, and the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for Netanyahu and a former Israeli defense chief. 'I am absolutely confident that under President Trump's leadership, together with you, Secretary Rubio, the best days of our alliance are still yet to come.' Secretary of State Rubio reiterated the Trump administration's demand that Hamas release all remaining hostages immediately. 'The hostages need to come home,' said Rubio. 'That must happen. It is not optional.' Rubio also lauded Trump's Gaza plan as a 'bold' alternative to the 'tired ideas of the past.' 'The president has also been very bold in his view of what the future should be for the Gaza Strip. Not the same tired ideas of the past; something bold that, frankly, took courage.'

New DNA research could lead to personalized cancer prevention for...	Using advanced genomic tools, the team discovered that DNA’s environment plays a crucial role in determining how much damage occurs and how well cells can repair it. By Pesach Benson, TPS New research about how smoking damages DNA could open new possibilities for targeted cancer prevention. Israeli and US researchers found that the way DNA is organized and chemically modified influences how cigarette smoke affects it. In a study recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, Nucleic Acids Research, the scientists found that some areas of DNA are more open and active, making them more vulnerable to damage but also more efficient at repairing themselves. Other regions are less capable of repair, allowing mutations to develop and potentially lead to cancer. The researchers from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, led by Prof. Sheera Adar and graduate student Elisheva Heilbrun-Katz — collaborated with Prof. Raluca Gordan from Duke University and the University of Massachusetts — also provides new insights into how smoking-related lung cancer develops. Globally, tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. In 2019, it was responsible for approximately 2.6 million cancer deaths, accounting for about 25% of all cancer fatalities worldwide, according to the American Cancer Society. Around 8,000 Israelis die from illnesses caused by active or passive smoking, including various cancers, heart attacks, strokes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to figures released by the Israeli Health Ministry in January. To examine how DNA structure and chemical modifications affect damage from cigarette smoke and the body’s ability to repair it, the researchers focused on benzo[a]pyrene, a harmful chemical found in cigarette smoke. When processed by the body, it turns into Benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), a substance that binds to DNA and interferes with its normal function. Using advanced genomic tools, the team discovered that DNA’s environment plays a crucial role in determining how much damage occurs and how well cells can repair it. Open and active regions of DNA experience more damage but are also repaired more efficiently. Transcription factors, proteins that regulate gene activity, can either protect DNA from damage or increase its vulnerability. The study also found that the efficiency of DNA repair is a key factor in whether mutations form, regardless of how much damage initially occurs. The research suggests that the body’s ability to fix DNA damage is more important than the extent of the damage itself in determining cancer risk. Understanding that some DNA regions are more vulnerable to smoking-induced mutations could help identify high-risk individuals based on genetic and epigenetic factors. This could lead to personalized smoking cessation programs or targeted monitoring for early cancer detection. Moreover, if certain transcription factors influence DNA repair efficiency, drugs could be developed to enhance repair in vulnerable regions, potentially reducing the mutation burden and slowing cancer progression. The findings could help identify specific genetic or epigenetic markers that indicate a higher risk of lung cancer, allowing for earlier and more precise screening methods. And in the long-term, modifying DNA repair mechanisms through gene therapy or epigenetic drugs might help protect high-risk individuals from accumulating smoking-related mutations.

Israeli soldiers arrest 20 men crossing into Lebanon to visit Tal...	The police stressed that illegally crossing the Lebanese border is punishable by up to four years in prison. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli soldiers arrested a group of around 20 Orthodox men who illegally crossed into Lebanese territory to reach the grave of a prominent Talmudic rabbi that straddles the border, the Israeli Police said on Sunday. According to the police, the Israel Defense Forces arrested the Haredim after they crossed the border. They were trying to reach the grave of Rav Ashi, a key figure in the compilation and writing of the Babylonian Talmud. Rav Ashi, who died around 427 CE, headed the Sura Academy in Babylonia, in what is now southern Iraq. He is credited with beginning the process of editing and organizing the discussions of previous generations of sages, which ultimately became the Babylonian Talmud. His work, continued after his death by later scholars laid the foundation for Jewish law as it is known today. Rav Ashi was laid to rest in the Upper Galilee near the present site of Kibbutz Manara, though some scholars believe his grave is in Iraq. A shrine marking the burial spot is located inside a compound located between IDF and UNIFIL positions. The police stressed that illegally crossing the Lebanese border is punishable by up to four years in prison. In November, 71-year-old Israeli civilian researcher Zeev Erlich was killed along with Sgt. Gur Kehati in a Hezbollah ambush after illegally entering Lebanon hoping to find the burial site of Simon the Zealot, a lesser-known disciple of Jesus. Erlich had entered Lebanon wearing an army uniform, though he was neither on active or reserve duty. Two other soldiers were injured in the ambush. Under the terms of a two-month ceasefire that went into effect on November 27 and has since been extended, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its armed presence from areas of southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. Israeli forces have withdrawn from most of southern Lebanon. Dissatisfied with the Lebanese army’s deployment, Israel is keeping soldiers in five locations with US approval. The 'Blue Line' demarcating the 120 km-long Israeli-Lebanese border was created in 2000 by UN cartographers to verify Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon, which the UN Security Council later certified as complete. The border runs from Rosh HaNikra on the Mediterranean coast to Mount Dov, where the Israeli-Lebanese border converges with Syria.

Israel frees 369 Palestinian terrorists as part of hostage deal	The distribution plan indicated that 334 prisoners were to be taken to Gaza, 24 faced deportation abroad, reportedly to Egypt, 10 were to be transferred to Judea and Samaria and one was to be sent to eastern Jerusalem. By JNS Israel released 369 Palestinian terrorists on Saturday in exchange for three Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The prisoners were freed wearing sweatshirts featuring a Star of David and the phrase 'Never forgive, never forget' in Arabic. Some discarded and burned the clothing.

With two weeks left in the first phase of the truce, a total of 21 hostages and over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners have been released so far. According to the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club, 333 of the released prisoners were from Gaza and were detained after Oct. 7, 2023. The distribution plan indicated that 334 prisoners were to be taken to Gaza, 24 faced deportation abroad, reportedly to Egypt, 10 were to be transferred to Judea and Samaria and one was to be sent to eastern Jerusalem. Thirty-six prisoners serving life sentences were among those released. Among them was Ahmed Barghouti, a close aide of Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti. Ahmed Barghouti was serving 13 life sentences for attacks that killed 12 Israelis during the Second Intifada [2000-2005], including the devastating bombing at Tel Aviv’s Seafood Market restaurant. The release roster also includes Mansour Sharim, a prominent figure in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades in Tulkarem. Serving 14 life sentences, Sharim orchestrated numerous attacks against Israelis during the Second Intifada. His conviction encompasses intentional causing of death and attempted murder charges. According to Israeli Justice Ministry records, he too was facing deportation. Another significant release involves Mansour Mokdeh, a Fatah member imprisoned since 2002. Serving a 30-year sentence for weapons possession and murder, Mokdeh was slated for permanent deportation. Palestinian media sources also indicated the imminent release of Shadi Abu Shahadam, who played a key role in planning and executing the 2002 Mahane Yehuda suicide bombing that claimed six Israeli lives. The attack was carried out by a woman from Hebron. Abu Shahadam, currently serving a life sentence, was facing permanent deportation. His conviction includes multiple charges: making threats, intentional causing of death, membership in an unauthorized organization, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit a crime. He has remained in custody since 2002. The hostages freed in this exchange were American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Argentine-Israeli Iair Horn, 46, and Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, 29. Under the first six-week phase of the ceasefire agreement, a total of 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are set to be released.

Torture, lice-ridden tunnels, salty water – freed hostages speak ...	Sagui Dekel-Chen, Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov and Iair Horn suffered unspeakable conditions in Hamas captivity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Sagui Dekel-Chen, Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov and Iair Horn, the three hostages freed Saturday, have begun revealing the unspeakable conditions in which they were held during 498 days of Hamas captivity, Channel 12 and Kan News reported Sunday. The trio, who were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, were held almost the entire time in tunnels under Khan Yunis, only a few miles away from their point of capture. The underground passages were moldy and infested with lice and bedbugs. The hostages were also given practically no food and only salty water to drink, which only increased their thirst. Hamas suspected some of the men of being IDF soldiers, although all three men were over army age. American-Israeli Dekel-Chen (36) underwent frequent interrogations to reveal intelligence that he did not have, and the results of the torture have left scars on his body, Channel 12 reported. He was also shot in his right shoulder when Hamas forces overran Nir Oz and he went to fight the terrorists while leaving his pregnant wife and two young daughters inside their home’s safe room. Dekel-Chen reported that he was completely cut off from all means of communication over these 16 months and lived with the constant thought that his family had been murdered in the kibbutz. He was only informed that they were alive just before his release, including the fact that his wife had given birth to a third daughter some two months after his capture. Russian-Israeli Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov, 29, was shot in both legs and brutally beaten when captured by the terrorists. Unlike the others, he was held alone his entire time in captivity, and learned to read and write Arabic as a means to keep busy. He was only updated irregularly by his captors as to what was happening in the war but did hear on the radio that his mother and girlfriend, who had been captured along with him but whom he never saw, had been freed in the first deal with Hamas in November 2023. Troufanov’s and Dekel-Chen’s wounds were left untreated the whole time in captivity, and it is likely that they will have to undergo surgery to repair their injuries. Horn (46) lost several dozen kilograms during his time in captivity and did not receive regular medical treatment. He had been kidnapped along with his brother, Eitan (37), who had come to the kibbutz for the Simchat Torah holiday that was being celebrated on October 7. The brothers were at first held together but then were separated, and Horn does not know Eitan’s current condition. The three hostages were exchanged for 369 Palestinian security prisoners, including 36 senior terrorists serving life sentences. While the deal’s parameters were that 30 terrorists would be released for every male civilian, Israel also promised to release 1,000 Palestinians who were detained since the October 7 Hamas-led invasion and did not participate in the day’s massacre of 1,200 people. Some of this cohort are seemingly being freed every week, which is why the number of freed prisoners is so high.

Amazon finally speaks out on employee held hostage in Gaza	For 16 months, the retail giant kept quiet about the Israeli hostage because it said it didn’t want to endanger him. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Amazon headquarters has finally spoken out after its employee, Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov, was released Saturday as part of the first phase of the Israel-Hamas hostage and ceasefire deal. CEO Andy Jassy wrote an email to the international retail giant’s entire workforce, saying, 'I’m incredibly relieved to share the news that our AWS teammate, Sasha Troufanov, who had been held hostage since the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, has been released from captivity.' Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides cloud computing services to its clients, and Troufanov worked for the Annapurna Labs subsidiary in Israel that designed a new chip for the company. When the company held a conference that featured the chip during the week in November 2023 that Israel and Hamas had their first hostage deal, in which Troufanov’s mother, grandmother and girlfriend were released, among others, friends of the captive paid to have trucks with screens bearing Troufanov’s face drive around outside the Las Vegas hall. Amazon itself did not comment on the kidnapping, nor did it condemn Hamas, angering many Jewish employees in various countries, who said that for the first few months they did not even know that their colleague was among those forcibly taken into Gaza. Only the company's Israeli employees were allowed to show Troufanov's picture on their walls and speak about their colleague. In Saturday’s message, Jassy insisted that Amazon had 'had a dedicated team working behind the scenes with experts to support efforts to secure [the Troufanovs’] release and to ensure that we did the right thing for them and their safety.' This included, he added, 'painfully not commenting publicly for fear that we would negatively impact their ability to be released or how they were treated in captivity.' The CEO thanked 'all who tirelessly advocated' for Troufanov’s safe return. One of these was a close friend of the Russian-Israeli engineer, Neta Yesood Alon, who angrily told Globes in May that the company 'had explained to activists and the family that any public activity in Amazon’s name was liable to put Troufanov at risk, and that they didn’t want to turn Sasha into the poster child of the hostages, because that would raise his value.' When Globes contacted Amazon for a comment, it vaguely stated that 'We continue to focus all the time on all the efforts to bring Sasha back home safely,' and said it was 'support[ing] the family at this difficult time.' In the email, Jassy repeated that his company 'will continue to support them and do everything we can to help them heal' now that Troufanov was free. He ended with a general message that his 'heart goes out to everyone impacted by the war' and that he hoped for peace, while still not condemning the terrorists who were the cause of his employee’s horrific ordeal.

IAF kills Hezbollah drone force commander	During the war, Hezbollah’s aerial forces, known as Unit 127, repeatedly fired explosives-laden drones into Israel. By JNS An Israeli Air Force strike in Southern Lebanon on Saturday night killed Hezbollah operative Abbas Ahmad Hamoud, who was responsible for overseeing the Iranian-backed terror group’s aerial force. Hamoud was targeted after repeatedly violating the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire, including by launching UAVs toward Israeli territory, according to the Israel Defense Forces. 'The IDF continues to operate to remove any threat to the State of Israel and will operate to prevent any attempt by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to establish itself, which is contrary to the understandings reached between Israel and Lebanon,' added the statement. During the war, Hezbollah’s aerial forces, known as Unit 127, repeatedly fired explosives-laden drones into Israel. Overnight Thursday, IAF fighter jets attacked Hezbollah targets in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley after the Iranian-backed terrorist organization dispatched a surveillance drone over the Jewish state. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Saturday described the launch of the drones at the Jewish state as 'a red line' and 'a blatant violation' of the ceasefire agreement. 'As I warned, if there are drones, there will be no Hezbollah,' said Katz. Also on Thursday, the IAF carried out targeted strikes on Hezbollah military sites in Southern Lebanon that posed a direct threat to Israel’s security, the IDF said. 'Terrorist activity in these sites is a clear violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,' the military added. The IDF’s 769th 'Hiram' Brigade, operating under the 91st 'Galilee' Division, is continuing to conduct searches in Southern Lebanon as part of operations aligned with the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, the army stated on Thursday. Troops have discovered weapons depots containing missiles, rockets, mortar shells, grenades, explosives and firearms. In forested areas, they also found concealed multi-barrel launchers aimed at Israeli territory. Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri announced on Thursday that Beirut rejects Israel’s plan to maintain a presence in five locations in Southern Lebanon after the ceasefire’s Feb. 18 expiration date. According to Berri, the United States, acting as a mediator, informed him that Israel would withdraw from certain villages but intended to remain in five strategic points. Berri, an ally of Hezbollah, stated that he had conveyed Lebanon’s complete rejection of this proposal on behalf of Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. Under the ceasefire agreement, Israeli forces are to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon as the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) assume responsibility for ensuring Hezbollah remains disarmed south of the Litani River. However, there has been growing concern in Jerusalem regarding the LAF’s ability to effectively curb Hezbollah’s presence. In response, the IDF continues frequent border operations to prevent the group from regaining strength, including intelligence gathering, reconnaissance and clearing terrain to disrupt terrorist movements. The ceasefire, which took effect on Nov. 27, mandated an Israeli withdrawal within 60 days.

Lebanon: 25 UNIFIL attackers arrested, will be punished	The incident raised serious questions as to whether Lebanese security forces are capable of reigning in Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Lebanese security forces have arrested 25 people who participated in a recent attack on UN peacekeeping forces, according to an official statement. Last Friday, Hezbollah activists waving the terror group's flags attacked a convoy of UNIFIL soldiers near Beirut International Airport. Footage of the attack circulating on social media showed mobs beating UNIFIL soldiers and setting one of their vehicles on fire. Two UN soldiers were wounded in the attack, including Nepalese national Chok Bahadur Dhaka, who is the outgoing deputy force commander of UNIFIL. Dhaka's injuries were serious enough that he required hospitalization. 'More than 25 people have been arrested by Lebanese army intelligence,' Lebanese Interior Minister Ahmad al-Hajjar told reporters during a media conference on Saturday. However, al-Hajjar noted, 'this does not mean these detainees carried out the attack… but the investigations will show who is responsible.' Lebanese President Joseph Aoun pledged in a statement posted to his X account that 'the attackers will receive their punishment.' Aoun added that 'security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to upset stability and civil peace.' The chaos began with a protest by pro-Hezbollah activists, who were demonstrating against a decision by Lebanese authorities to disallow an Iranian plane from landing. The denial to land occurred after an Israeli warning that Iran was using the airport to smuggle cash to Hezbollah, which would make the transportation hub a potential target for the IDF. Hezbollah activists raged that Lebanon was caving to Israeli and international pressure, and they blocked roads near the airport as an act of protest. UNIFIL was called in to deescalate the situation, but instead, came under attack by Hezbollah activists. The incident raised serious questions as to whether Lebanese security forces are capable of reigning in Hezbollah and its activists. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the violence in a press statement. 'Such attacks are absolutely unacceptable… The safety and security of UN personnel and property must be respected at all times,' Stephane Dujarric, Guterres’s spokesman, said in a media release. 'Attacks against peacekeepers are in breach of international law… and may constitute war crimes,' the statement added. 'UNIFIL must be allowed unrestricted freedom of movement throughout Lebanon.'

After Trump lifts ban, US heavy bombs arrive in Israel	Shipment of MK-84 heavy aerial munitions arrive in Israel over the weekend, after being held up for nearly a year by the Biden administration. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News After close to a year of delays, a shipment of heavy aerial bombs from the United States arrived in Israel over the weekend. Israel's Ministry of Defense announced Sunday morning that a shipment of heavy aerial bombs recently released by the U.S. government was received and unloaded late Saturday night. A shipping vessel carrying an order of 2,000-pound MK-84 munitions docked Saturday night and was unloaded at the Port of Ashdod before dawn Sunday morning. The munitions were loaded onto dozens of trucks from the Transportation Unit of the Ministry’s Logistics and Assets Department and the IDF's Technological and Logistics Directorate and transferred to Israeli Air Force bases. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) said that the arrival of the heavy bombs serves as 'evidence' of the strong ties between Israel and the U.S. Katz also called the aerial munitions a 'significant asset' for the Israeli military. 'The munitions shipment that arrived in Israel tonight, released by the Trump Administration, represents a significant asset for the Air Force and the IDF and serves as further evidence of the strong alliance between Israel and the United States.' 'In our recent conversation, Secretary of Defense, HON Pete Hegseth reaffirmed America's commitment to continue providing Israel with all necessary tools to ensure its security.' 'I thank President Donald Trump and the U.S. Administration for their unwavering support of the State of Israel. We will continue working together to strengthen our security.'​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ The shipment of MK-84 heavy bombs was held up for nearly a year, after the Biden administration suspended the transfer of some aerial munitions to Israel, amid criticism of the IDF's handling of the war in the Gaza Strip and in protest of Israel's plans in early 2024 to carry out a large-scale ground operation in Rafah. Shortly after taking office, President Donald Trump lifted the Biden-era ban, clearing the way for the shipment of MK-84 bombs to be transferred to Israel.

Russian Ambassador meets newly-freed hostage Sasha Trufanov	The Kremlin does not classify Hamas or Islamic Jihad - the group which held Trufanov - as terror organizations. By World Israel News Staff Russian Ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov met with former Islamic Jihad hostage Alexander 'Sasha' Trufanov just hours after his release from captivity, presenting him with a new Russian passport on Saturday. The ambassador 'sincerely welcomed the release of our compatriot,' the Russian Embassy in Israel wrote on its official X account, alongside images of Viktorov meeting with Trufanov at Sheba Hospital. 'Russian diplomats did not stop their efforts to free Alexander Trufanov for a single day,' the embassy added. 'They were in constant contact with the Israeli and all interested parties in the region on this priority issue for us.' The statement noted that advocacy efforts for Trufanov's release were performed 'on the instruction of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin.' Notably, the Kremlin does not classify Hamas or Islamic Jihad - the group which held Trufanov - as terror organizations. Viktorov gave a new Russian passport to Trufanov, which he had previously applied for but 'for obvious reasons, was unable to receive on time.' Trufanov was kidnapped along with his mother, Yelena, grandmother, Irena, and girlfriend Sapir Cohen from his parent's home in Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7th. His father, Vitaly, was murdered by terrorists during the attack. Trufanov's mother and grandmother were released in a November 2023 agreement between the Kremlin and the terror group, which did not require concessions from Russia towards Hamas. Cohen, his girlfriend, was released in an Israeli hostage deal that saw the majority of Israeli female and child captives freed from Gaza. In recent months, Moscow raised concerns around Trufanov's physical health, as he was shot twice during his abduction and was never provided with proper medical care. A Russian government spokesman celebrating Trufanov's release failed to mention that Israel had freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners as part of the deal. 'We thank the Hamas administration for its decision,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.

Hamas captors cynically gave Sagui Dekel-Chen earrings for his wi...	Dekel-Chen did not believe the terrorists about the birth of his daughter until the IDF confirmed it was true. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As a form of psychological torture, Hamas terrorists informed Sagui Dekel-Chen about the birth of his daughter, gave him earrings, and instructed him to give them to his wife. Dekel-Chen did not believe the terrorists about the birth of his daughter until the IDF confirmed it was true. He had been injured in the shoulder but told the soldiers to disregard his wounds, saying, 'What’s most important is meeting my family.' Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, and Sasha Troufanov were released together on Saturday after 498 days in captivity. Horn and Dekel-Chen were held together, while Troufanov was kept in isolation during his captivity. The three were held captive in Khan Younis, just a few hundred meters from where they were abducted at Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7th. Initially, they were confined in tunnels before being moved to apartments. Horn knew that his brother had also been taken hostage, and shortly after his capture, he asked, 'When will they release Eitan?' When the IDF informed Troufanov that his father, Vitaly, had been murdered, he broke down in tears. Although Dekel-Chen, Horn, and Troufanov showed signs of severe weight loss and were weak and pale, they could stand and walk independently. They appeared healthier than the three hostages released the previous week, whose emaciated appearances were compared to Holocaust survivors. Upon their release, the hostages were given small amounts of food, including tea with sugar, applesauce, a few biscuits, and vitamin B1 (thiamine) to prevent refeeding syndrome—a potentially fatal condition that can occur when food is reintroduced too quickly to the body of someone severely malnourished. The hostages had appeared in videos created by Hamas for propaganda purposes and psychological warfare against Israelis. Horn was coerced into mentioning his brother Eitan in one of these videos. Regarding the release of Troufanov, a Russian citizen, Russian press secretary Dmitry Peskov said, 'Moscow praises the release of Alexander Troufanov in Palestine.' Peskov also thanked Hamas for agreeing to release him.

Hamas agrees to relinquish control of Gaza in second phase of hos...	Hamas said it would be prepared to discuss the implementation of Phase Two of the hostage and ceasefire agreement on Monday. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas has reportedly agreed to step down from governing Gaza during the second phase of the ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement. On Thursday, senior official Osama Hamdan told Qatar-based Al Araby TV that Hamas would be prepared to discuss the implementation of Phase Two of the agreement on Monday. Hamdan said the terror group would abide by the agreement; 'If Israel meets its commitments, we will proceed with releasing the hostages as agreed on Saturday or in the coming days.' As part of Phase Two, Hamas agreed it would step away from governing Gaza. The ceasefire agreement seemed to have been at an impasse last Monday when Hamas said it would not return hostages as agreed on Saturday, citing allegations that Israel had violated the agreement. Hamas claimed that Israel was blocking aid and preventing civilians from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. 'Over the past three weeks, the resistance leadership has been observing the enemy's violations and their failure to uphold the terms of the agreement,' Hamas stated. 'The return of displaced people to the northern Gaza Strip is being delayed, while they are being targeted with shelling and gunfire in various parts of Gaza. Additionally, relief supplies of all kinds are being blocked from entering as agreed, even though the resistance has fulfilled all its commitments.' Last Sunday, footage published on social media showed Gazans approaching the border with Israel, violating the ceasefire agreement that requires a 700-meter buffer zone. The video shows Gazan civilians near Kibbutz Nahal Oz, prompting the IDF to fire shots into the crowd. Gazan media reported that three people were killed in the shooting. The IDF stated that it fired warning shots in multiple areas of Gaza. Defense Minister Israel Katz commented on the incident on Sunday night, saying, 'Israel’s security stance on Gaza remains firm: Anyone entering the buffer zone does so at their own risk.' 'There will be no tolerance for those who pose a threat to IDF forces, the border region, or nearby communities. We will not allow a repeat of the events of October 7. 'IDF troops acted appropriately today in identifying and neutralizing the threat, and this approach will continue. The IDF is fully prepared for any scenario and will respond decisively to any danger,' Katz stated. The IDF has cautioned Palestinians against approaching the Israeli border and the buffer zone within Gaza, where its troops are stationed.

369 Palestinian prisoners freed, forced to wear sweatshirts with ...	Of the 369 Palestinian prisoners released Saturday, 36 were serving life sentences for murder. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The 369 Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for three hostages on Saturday were made to wear sweatshirts with a Star of David on the back, alongside the phrase 'We will not forget nor forgive' in Arabic. These prisoners were freed in exchange for Sagui Dekel Chen, Alexander Sasha Troufanov, and Iair Horn, who had been held in Gaza for 498 days. Of the 369 Palestinian prisoners, 36 were serving life sentences for murder. One source criticized Israel's prison service (IPS) to KAN News for making the decision to have the prisoners wear the sweatshirts, pointing out that the political echelon had not been informed, and the action projected a negative image at a time when Israel is condemning Hamas's cynical tactics to cause embarrassment and psychological harm to hostages, such as releasing them with medals, ceremonies, and 'goody bags.' The IPS clarified that the decision was made by IPS Commissioner Kobi Yaakovi, according to KAN. Hamas condemned the shirts, calling the slogans written on them 'racist' and referring to the treatment of prisoners as a violation of humanitarian law, in contrast to the resistance's strong commitment to moral values in the treatment of the enemy's prisoners. Among the prisoners released on Saturday was Ahmed Barghouti, cousin and aide to intifada terrorist Marwan Barghouti, who was directly involved in attacks that killed 12 Israelis. Another released prisoner was Fatah terrorist Mazen al-Qadi, who planned a 2002 attack on a seafood restaurant in Tel Aviv that killed three Israelis. Qadi was also suspected of sexually assaulting five female guards at Ramon Prison in 2023. Mantzur Sharim, serving 14 life sentences plus an additional 50 years, was also released. During the Second Intifada, he attacked a banquet hall in Hadera, killing six Israelis and injuring 26. Sharim also murdered a soldier and a civilian in 2001.

3 released hostages appeared emaciated, pale	Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov, Sagui Dekel Chen, and Iair Horn, appeared emaciated and pale as they returned to Israel after 498 days in captivity. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The three hostages, Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov, Sagui Dekel Chen, and Iair Horn, appeared emaciated and pale as they returned to Israel after 498 days in captivity. However, the three were able to stand and walk unaided, and medical professionals determined they did not require hospitalization at either Soroka Medical Center or Barzilai Medical Center in the South. In addition to being checked by medical staff in Re'im, they were accompanied by mental health officers on their way to both Ichilov Hospital and Sheba Medical Center. The freed hostages were given small amounts of food, including tea with sugar, applesauce, a few biscuits, and vitamin B1 (thiamine) to prevent refeeding syndrome, a potentially fatal condition that can occur when food is introduced too suddenly into the system of someone who is severely malnourished. The three were reunited with their families, underwent medical tests, and were transported by Yasur helicopter for further treatment. Medical professionals are concerned that, in addition to the psychological trauma endured by the former hostages, their near-starvation conditions might have caused permanent damage to their hearts and muscles. The families of the hostages expressed joy and relief at the return of their loved ones. The Troufanov family said in a statement: 'We are filled with overwhelming emotion and gratitude as Sasha returns home after 498 long and agonizing days in captivity. On October 7, he was brutally abducted from his home and shot in both legs. Seeing him today is a powerful source of strength, offering us renewed hope for the challenging rehabilitation ahead. This moment brings immense relief to us, his friends, and to everyone who never gave up hope and prayed for his safe return.'

Iran, facing threats from Trump to roll back nuclear weapons prog...	Iran unveiled two types of ballistic missiles, the Khorramshahr and Hajj Qassem, as well as a satellite carrier dubbed the 'Omid.' By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Iran paraded a cache of highly advanced ballistic missiles across Tehran following a series of threats by President Donald Trump to 'bomb the hell' out of the country if it doesn’t roll back its atomic weapons program. As the hardline regime worked to prove its military might, a senior Iranian militaIran unveiled two types of ballistic missiles, the Khorramshahr and Hajj Qassem, as well as a satellite carrier dubbed the 'Omid.'ry commander dared Trump to strike, saying he 'does not have the courage to attack Iran.' The charged rhetoric signals that Tehran is choosing confrontation with the United States after Trump reimposed his 'maximum pressure' sanctions campaign on the country, which specifically aims to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program and deny it intercontinental ballistic missiles—the same ones used to attack Israel twice last year. At the same time, Trump has expressed a willingness to pursue diplomacy with Iran, saying he favors that approach over conflict. But the military demonstrations across Tehran this week, held to celebrate the 46th anniversary of the regime’s 'Islamic revolution,' indicate the president is facing an uphill battle. 'Trump does not have the courage to attack Iran,' General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Aerospace Force, said on the sidelines of Monday’s military display. 'Iran, as a powerful nation, does not bow to coercion.' Iran unveiled two types of ballistic missiles, the Khorramshahr and Hajj Qassem, as well as a satellite carrier dubbed the 'Omid.' The towering ballistic missiles can travel around 1,800 to 2,000 kilometers, putting them well within reach of not only Israel but U.S. military outposts across the region. The Khorramshahr 'can carry multiple warheads,' while the Hajj Qassem is a 'precision strike missile' that can penetrate enemy air defense systems, much like those Israel used last year to fend off a swarm of Iranian missiles, according to the Iran’s state-controlled media. Other missiles in Tehran’s arsenal are nuclear-capable and based on North Korean technology. Iran emphasized that it can now build much of this equipment on its own, without help from allies like Russia and China. For regional observers, Tehran’s military posturing is part of a bid to restore its image in the wake of Israel’s devastating October strike on the country’s air defense systems and key military installations. 'These highly public shows of force are how the regime hopes to repair its battered deterrence after Israel’s successful military pushback against it in 2024,' said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a nonproliferation expert who analyzes Iran’s weapons program for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. As part of this image rehabilitation, Tehran ran additional air defense drills this week and revealed a 'new solid-propellant medium range ballistic missile,' according to Ben Taleblu, who said he expects Iran to continue testing Trump in the coming months. 'While Trump’s new presidential memorandum will be a bright green light to enforce maximum pressure sanctions which long atrophied under Biden, Iran in the short term will continue to ramp up its nuclear capable missile threat,' he said. During a Wednesday public appearance, Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei praised the country’s military establishment for making advances on ballistic missiles and other weapons technology. 'Iran's defense power is known to everyone today,' he said. 'While the friends of the revolution are proud of it and the enemies are afraid of it.' Khamenei’s remarks came after he toured a military facility producing a series of new 'kamikaze' drones, which appear similar to those used by Hezbollah during its siege on Israel’s northern border. Amid this flurry of military activity, Iranian diplomats on Tuesday filed a formal complaint with the United Nations Security Council over Trump’s repeated threats to bomb the country if a diplomatic deal cannot be reached. 'I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear,' Trump told the New York Post on Saturday. 'I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it.' The president made similar remarks a day later on Fox News. Iran’s ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, complained that Trump’s 'reckless and inflammatory statements flagrantly violate international and the U.N. charter.' 'The Islamic Republic of Iran firmly rejects and condemns this reckless threat,' Iravani said before the international body. 'The U.N. Security Council must not remain silent in the face of such brazen rhetoric, as normalizing the threat to use force sets a dangerous precedent and must be unequivocally condemned.'

As Kennedy takes over the Department of Health and Human Services, he faces significant challenges, including shaping vaccine policy, managing Medicare and Medicaid, and preparing for future public health crises. By Jewish Breaking News Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in a 52-48 Senate vote, overcoming strong opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans. His confirmation follows a dramatic political evolution, from being a staunch Trump critic to becoming a key figure in the administration. Kennedy, a longtime environmental lawyer and vaccine skeptic, once harshly criticized President Donald Trump, even comparing him to Adolf Hitler. However, during the 2024 election, Kennedy initially launched a Democratic presidential bid before switching to an independent campaign. As his poll numbers declined and financial struggles mounted, he suspended his campaign in August 2024 and endorsed Trump, citing alignment on key issues such as government health mandates and regulatory overreach. Robert Kennedy walks out during a Trump rally. (Twitter Screenshot) Trump rewarded Kennedy’s endorsement by nominating him for HHS Secretary in November 2024, a move that stunned both parties. While conservatives saw it as an unconventional choice, Kennedy’s history of opposing vaccine mandates and public health restrictions resonated with many in Trump’s base. Kennedy’s confirmation process was fiercely contested. Democrats unanimously opposed him due to his decades-long promotion of vaccine conspiracy theories, while some Republicans were wary of his past support for abortion rights and environmental regulations. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor and staunch vaccine advocate, was the only Republican to vote against Kennedy. Leading up to the vote, Senate Democrats staged an all-night protest, warning that Kennedy’s appointment could undermine public health initiatives. However, despite their efforts, Kennedy secured the necessary votes on Thursday morning. As Kennedy takes over the Department of Health and Human Services, he faces significant challenges, including shaping vaccine policy, managing Medicare and Medicaid, and preparing for future public health crises. His critics worry that his leadership could erode trust in scientific institutions, while his supporters argue he will bring much-needed reform to federal health agencies. Kennedy’s appointment marks a major shift in the Trump administration’s approach to public health, setting the stage for contentious policy battles in the months ahead. Whether he moderates his stance or doubles down on his past positions remains to be seen. The post Robert F.

Trump will support ‘any decision Israel makes’ about Hamas, notin...	Trump had warned that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed on Gaza if Hamas did not release all the hostages by the 12:00 deadline. By World Israel News and JNS Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump for his leadership and strong stance, which contributed to the hostages' release on Saturday morning, according to a statement issued on Saturday night. 'The combination of the reinforcement of IDF forces around the Gaza Strip and President Trump's firm stance led to the release of three of our hostages today - despite Hamas's earlier refusal to release them,' the statement read. 'The Prime Minister also appreciates the President's full support for Israel's decisions regarding the Gaza Strip going forward.' The U.S. president congratulated the freed hostages, but made clear that their release fell short of his call to free all the captives. 'Hamas has just released three Hostages from GAZA, including an American Citizen. They seem to be in good shape! This differs from their statement last week that they would not release any Hostages,' Trump said on Saturday on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Israel will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O’CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES. The United States will back the decision they make!' he added, seemingly referring to U.S. Eastern Time, which is 7 p.m. in Israel. The president’s deadline was a reference to his previous warning that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed on Gaza if Hamas did not release all the hostages. Seventy-three hostages remain inside the Strip, including 70 kidnapped on Oct. 7. Saturday’s exchange of hostages for terrorists was the sixth such round under Phase 1 of the ceasefire that took effect on Jan. 19 and is to end on March 1. The three latest returnees from Hamas captivity in Gaza reunited on Saturday with their families in heartfelt scenes of elation and relief. American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, met with his wife, Avital, and his parents at the IDF’s Re’im camp just outside the Strip before being flown by helicopter to Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer in Ramat Gan. שגיא דקל-חן במפגש הראשון המרגש עם אשתו אביטל והוריו נעומית ויונתן, בנקודת הקליטה הראשונית בישראל. צילומים: דובר צה'ל pic.twitter.com/OWSVIQZeuF &mdash; ראש ממשלת ישראל (@IsraeliPM_heb) February 15, 2025 During the reunion, Avital informed him of their third daughter’s name. She was seven-months’ pregnant when Dekel-Chen was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023. 'Do you remember what you called her? That’s her name, Shahar-Mazal,' she said. 'Perfect,' Dekel-Chen replied. 'You are heroes, you protected me,' Dekel-Chen told his spouse and mother. Embracing his wife in the helicopter, he held a sign addressed to his three daughters that read, 'Daddy is on his way.' שגיא דקל-חן עם בני משפחתו, במסוק בדרכם לבית החולים. שגיא כתב: 'ברי, גלי, שחר - תודה ששמרתן עליי, אבא בדרך' צילומים: דובר צה'ל pic.twitter.com/Vu2PMqwYRM &mdash; ראש ממשלת ישראל (@IsraeliPM_heb) February 15, 2025 The Dekel-Chen family released a statement to the press, saying, 'Our Sagie is home.

In the coming hours, he will begin the recovery process, reunite with his daughters, Gali and Bar, and meet his youngest daughter, Shachar, for the first time—she was born while he was in captivity. 'Our hearts ache for all that he missed, but now he is here, unlike so many others,' the statement read. 'There are still many families waiting for their loved ones, many children waiting for their fathers. We will continue to fight until the last hostage is brought home. This is our duty.'

Hostages reunite with families as Trump leaves Israel to decide o...	Saturday’s exchange of hostages for terrorists was the sixth such round under Phase 1 of the ceasefire that took effect on Jan. 19 and is to end on March 1. By JNS The three latest returnees from Hamas captivity in Gaza reunited on Saturday with their families in heartfelt scenes of elation and relief. American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, met with his wife, Avital, and his parents at the IDF’s Re’im camp just outside the Strip before being flown by helicopter to Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer in Ramat Gan. שגיא דקל-חן במפגש הראשון המרגש עם אשתו אביטל והוריו נעומית ויונתן, בנקודת הקליטה הראשונית בישראל. צילומים: דובר צה'ל pic.twitter.com/OWSVIQZeuF &mdash; ראש ממשלת ישראל (@IsraeliPM_heb) February 15, 2025 During the reunion, Avital informed him of their third daughter’s name. She was seven-months’ pregnant when Dekel-Chen was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023. 'Do you remember what you called her? That’s her name, Shahar-Mazal,' she said. 'Perfect,' Dekel-Chen replied. 'You are heroes, you protected me,' Dekel-Chen told his spouse and mother. Embracing his wife in the helicopter, he held a sign addressed to his three daughters that read, 'Daddy is on his way.' שגיא דקל-חן עם בני משפחתו, במסוק בדרכם לבית החולים. שגיא כתב: 'ברי, גלי, שחר - תודה ששמרתן עליי, אבא בדרך' צילומים: דובר צה'ל pic.twitter.com/Vu2PMqwYRM &mdash; ראש ממשלת ישראל (@IsraeliPM_heb) February 15, 2025 The Dekel-Chen family released a statement to the press, saying, 'Our Sagie is home.

In the coming hours, he will begin the recovery process, reunite with his daughters, Gali and Bar, and meet his youngest daughter, Shachar, for the first time—she was born while he was in captivity. 'Our hearts ache for all that he missed, but now he is here, unlike so many others,' the statement read. 'There are still many families waiting for their loved ones, many children waiting for their fathers. We will continue to fight until the last hostage is brought home. This is our duty.'

The U.S. president congratulated the freed hostages, but made clear that their release fell short of his call to free all the captives. 'Hamas has just released three Hostages from GAZA, including an American Citizen. They seem to be in good shape! This differs from their statement last week that they would not release any Hostages,' Trump said on Saturday on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Israel will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O’CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES. The United States will back the decision they make!' he added, seemingly referring to U.S. Eastern Time, which is 7 p.m. in Israel. The president’s deadline was a reference to his previous warning that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed on Gaza if Hamas did not release all the hostages. Seventy-three hostages remain inside the Strip, including 70 kidnapped on Oct. 7. Saturday’s exchange of hostages for terrorists was the sixth such round under Phase 1 of the ceasefire that took effect on Jan. 19 and is to end on March 1. Talks are ongoing on Phase 2 and 3, but it remains to be seen if they will be implemented or if war will resume.

Wedding of peace’: Children of Russian and Ukrainian rabbis marry...	At the wedding, Minister of Housing and Construction of the Israeli government, Zeev Elkin, who migrated to Israel from Ukraine in 1990, said a prayer for the return of all the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. By TPS Rivka Lazar, daughter of the Chief Rabbi of Russia Berl Lazar, and Sholom Wolf, son of the Chief Rabbi of Odessa and Southern Ukraine Avraham Wolf, got married yesterday in Jerusalem. Three thousand guests attended the ceremony, where the couple stood beneath the chuppah (traditional Jewish wedding canopy). The wedding host announced that this was going to be 'the chuppah of the piece.' 'The Chassidic world has always transgressed boundaries,' one of the guests of the ceremony who asked not to be identified told TPS-IL. 'It is not really so important that Russia and Ukraine are at war. Jews still remain friends and relatives, and that is how it always has been.' When the marriage was announced last November at the annual Congress of Chabad Ambassadors in New York, the popular joke was that US President Donald Trump had done the ‘shidduch’ (the matchmaking process in Hebrew). At the wedding, Minister of Housing and Construction of the Israeli government, Zeev Elkin, who migrated to Israel from Ukraine in 1990, said a prayer for the return of all the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The guests were offered a souvenir gift from the wedding – a collection of articles by the late Lubavitcher Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the spiritual leader of the Chabad movement. Berl Lazar has never condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Unlike leaders of other confessions in Russia, including Russian Patriarch Kirill or the Grand Mufti of Russia, Rawil Ğaynetdin, he has not supported it, either.

Azerbaijan becomes first Muslim-majority country to include antis...	The study did not find signs of Islamism or radicalism, instead noting a focus on a secular and inclusive national identity. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Azerbaijan has become the first Muslim-majority country to include a definition of antisemitism in its textbooks, according to a new report assessing the Azerbaijani educational system. The Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se), a nonprofit organization that analyzes schoolbooks and curricula around the world, examined 53 textbooks from Azerbaijan’s national curriculum, identifying significant improvements, such as the removal of anti-Israel narratives and the absence of Islamist rhetoric. As part of a series on Central Asian curricula produced in collaboration with the Ruderman Family Foundation, IMPACT-se is also examining the educational systems of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The new report released on Thursday not only highlights the inclusion of positive portrayals of Jews and Israel in Azerbaijan’s textbooks but also notes that these textbooks acknowledge the Holocaust as a mass genocide in which six million Jews were murdered. According to the London-based NGO, Azerbaijan’s national curriculum promotes ideals of diversity and tolerance, and offers a balanced view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The study did not find signs of Islamism or radicalism, instead noting a focus on a secular and inclusive national identity. 'Azerbaijan promotes the freedom of religion and tolerance, creating an open environment for all religions to flourish, including Judaism,' the study concluded. 'Students are taught the value of tolerance and harmony in modern society, and examples of Jewish prayer and rituals are incorporated into the curriculum.' The report highlighted 'promising progress and developments' in the revisions made for the 2024-25 school year, with Judaism being 'highly regarded in the textbooks' and some Biblical narratives included in the education system. For example, one key aspect was the inclusion of a definition of antisemitism, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim-majority country to do so and, according to the report, reflecting its commitment to promoting tolerance and fighting racism. In line with these goals, the country’s national curriculum also correctly portrays the Holocaust as a genocide of six million Jews, highlighting antisemitic measures such as arbitrary killings and imprisonment rather than trying to downplay or deny the Nazis’ atrocities. 'Antisemitism and the Holocaust are addressed within the framework of rejecting racism and totalitarian regimes,' the study said. The report also found that these textbooks explain the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a more balanced way, attributing its origins to Arab rejection of the 1947 UN Partition Plan and using terms like 'taken over' or 'captured' instead of 'occupied' when referring to territories under Israeli control. New revisions removed references to Zionism as racist and reclassified Palestinian violence, once called 'guerrilla warfare,' as terrorism, acknowledging its negative global impact. Additionally, geography textbooks now recognize Israel as a Jewish state. Despite these advancements, IMPACT-se highlighted the lack of Azerbaijani Jewish history and broader Jewish historical narratives, pointing to this as an area for further improvement. However, the findings in 'Israel and Jews in Azerbaijani Education,' the title of the Impact-se report, are the latest signs of the friendly relations between the two countries. Israel is presented as an ally, with references to shared military expertise, and derogatory references to domestic and international policy have been tempered. 'The textbooks demonstrate a clear rejection of the extreme Islamist values promoted by their near-neighbor Iran,' IMPACT–se CEO Marcus Sheff said in a statement. 'Instead, they promote tolerance, diversity, and a heartfelt respect for Jews and Israel, which serves as an important model for many other majority-Muslim states.' Azerbaijan’s ties with Israel have long been significant, with the country serving as the Jewish state’s most vital ally in the Caucasus and Central Asia for more than three decades, fostering a partnership that spans energy security, defense, and intelligence. Last week, Israel and Azerbaijan’s state oil company, SOCAR, struck a major energy deal, marking one of the latest examples of Azerbaijan’s emerging role as a strategic player in the Middle East.

Hostages Alexandre Troufanov, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Yair Horn free...	Since the ceasefire entered into force on Jan. 19, 19 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 566 Palestinian terrorists held in Israeli prisons. By JNS Three Israeli men regained their freedom on Saturday, after 498 days of captivity in the Gaza Strip. The hostages were handed over to representatives of the Red Cross at a staged event in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip, shortly after 10 a.m., and to the IDF and the Israeli Security Agency (Shin Bet) at approximately 10:30, and were being escorted to Israeli territory for an initial medical examination. Alexandre ('Sasha') Troufanov, 29, who has dual Russian citizenship, had been held by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist organization, while American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, and Argentinian-Israeli Yair Horn, 46, were captives of Hamas. In return, Israel is to release 369 terrorists later on Saturday—36 serving life sentences, most of who will go to the Gaza Strip or Egypt, and 333 terrorism suspects apprehended inside the Gaza Strip since the Hamas-led invasion of the northwestern Negev on Oct. 7, 2023, according to figures from the Palestinian Authority Prisoners Ministry. All three hostages were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Troufanov was abducted along with his mother, Yelena Trufanov; his grandmother Irena Tati; and his girlfriend, Sapir Cohen. His mother and grandmother were freed by Hamas on Nov. 29, 2023, at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Cohen was released as part of a ceasefire deal that same month. Troufanov’s father, Vitaly, was killed during the Oct. 7 massacre. Sagui Dekel-Chen was also taken from Nir Oz during the terrorist invasion. His mother, Neomit, was taken captive along with neighbors in an electric cart that was headed toward Gaza when an Israeli Air Force helicopter shot at the terrorists and driver. Neomit was wounded and escaped. Dekel-Chen’s third daughter, Shachar, was born two months later. Yair Horn’s brother Eitan, 38, who was visiting from Kfar Saba, was also kidnapped and is still in the Gaza Strip. Since the ceasefire entered into force on Jan. 19, 19 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 566 Palestinian terrorists held in Israeli prisons. The latter figure is to rise to 935 later on Saturday. During the first six weeks of the ceasefire, a total of 33 hostages are set to be freed in exchange for approximately 1,900 Palestinian terrorists held in Israel. Hamas says eight on the list of 33 captives have died inside the Gaza Strip. Saturday’s exchange of hostages for terrorists was the sixth such round under Phase 1 of the ceasefire that took effect on Jan. 19 and is to end on March 1. Talks are ongoing on Phase 2 and 3. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Gazan terrorists killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Seventy-three hostages remain inside the Strip, including 70 kidnapped on Oct. 7.

The Hamas official confirmed to Reuters that Dekel-Chen was among those set to be released from captivity. Separately, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist group said that it would free Russian-Israeli Troufanov as part of the arrangement. Israel has stated it will resume combat in Gaza if three hostages are not freed on time, after Hamas announced it was delaying the releases in response to alleged Israeli ceasefire violations. Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump called for the ceasefire to be abandoned if Hamas did not release all hostages held in Gaza by noon Saturday. Since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 566 Palestinian terrorists held in Israeli prisons. This will be the sixth round of hostage releases. During the first six weeks of the ceasefire, a total of 33 hostages are set to be freed in exchange for approximately 1,900 Palestinian terrorists held in Israel. Hamas says eight on the list are dead. The war began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when gunmen killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostages.

Hamas calls for ‘solidarity marches’ worldwide to protest Trump G...	Trump has suggested that the current population of Gaza would be moved to one large site or various locations. By JNS Hamas called for 'solidarity marches' on Friday, Saturday and Sunday to protest against U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to remove the Gazan population from the Strip in order to rebuild it. 'We … call on the masses of our people, our Arab and Islamic nation, and the free people of the world to go out in massive solidarity marches' to denounce 'the plans to displace our Palestinian people from their land,' the terrorist group said in a statement on Wednesday. Trump said that the United States will 'take over' Gaza, speaking during a press conference at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Feb. 4. Initially, Trump said Palestinians could return to Gaza, but he reversed himself on Feb. 10, telling Fox News host Bret Baier that Palestinians who leave the Gaza Strip would not return under his plan 'because they’re gonna have much better housing' elsewhere. Trump has suggested that the current population of Gaza would be moved to one large site or various locations. In an unverified report, Israel’s Channel 12 claimed that three areas being considered are Morocco, Somaliland, and Puntland, a region in northeast Somalia that declared itself an autonomous state in 1998. Netanyahu expressed support for the plan and a poll found that most Israeli Jews did so as well. Meanwhile, the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel struck on Jan. 19 appears to be disintegrating. Mediators Egypt and Qatar are attempting to resuscitate it as a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo for talks, the BBC reported on Thursday. Netanyahu said on Tuesday that unless Hamas returns all Israeli hostages by noon on Saturday, Feb. 15, the ceasefire will expire and the Israel Defense Forces will resume fighting until it totally defeats Hamas. Netanyahu’s ultimatum followed an 'in-depth, four-hour discussion' by the Cabinet. 'We all expressed outrage at the shocking state of our three hostages who were freed last Saturday. We all also welcomed President Trump’s demand for the release of our hostages by noon on Saturday,' the prime minister wrote. Netanyahu has ordered the IDF to amass forces in and around the Gaza Strip 'in light of Hamas’s statement about its decision to violate the [ceasefire] agreement,' Netanyahu said, referring to Hamas’s announcement that it would delay the release of hostages until further notice. The statement by Netanyahu announcing the ultimatum followed remarks by Trump on Feb. 10, who suggested Saturday noon as a deadline after which 'all hell will break loose' unless Hamas frees all hostages.

South Africa says ‘no chance’ it will withdraw genocide case agai...	Trump also accused South Africa in his executive order of working with Iran 'to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.' By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner South Africa has vowed to continue pursuing its case against Israel at Trump also accused South Africa in his executive order of working with Iran 'to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.'the United Nations’ top court accusing the Jewish state of committing genocide in Gaza, saying it will not change course despite strong US opposition. There is 'no chance' of South Africa withdrawing its case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague, Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told the Financial Times in a new interview. 'Standing by our principles sometimes has consequences, but we remain firm that this is important for the worldLamola, and the rule of law,' he added. The comments from South Africa’s top diplomat came after US President Donald Trump last week signed an executive order to 'halt foreign aid or assistance' to South Africa partly in response to the country’s ICJ case and anti-Israel stance. Trump’s order was also a response to South Africa’s new land expropriation law, which the US argues discriminates against Afrikaners, a minority South African ethnic group of European descent. During the interview, Lamola denied such accusations, stating that the White House’s statements were 'misinformation.' He also argued that the land reform is not 'arbitrary,' but an essential measure to rectify the land ownership inequalities left by apartheid. Trump also accused South Africa in his executive order of working with Iran 'to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.' 'While we do have a good relationship with Iran, we don’t have any nuclear programs with them, nor any trade to speak of,' Lamola said. US intelligence agencies have for years described Iran as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism, and Iranian leaders routinely declare their intention of destroying Israel. Trump’s executive order puts at risk not only $440 million in aid to South Africa but also tariff-free access to US markets under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, presenting a major challenge for the South African coalition government, which took power last year after the ruling African National Congress (ANC) lost its majority in parliament for the first time in South Africa’s post-apartheid democratic history. The ANC still remained the largest party and retained power at the national level through a coalition. 'We are willing to engage with them to persuade them, if they are willing to be persuaded,' Lamola said. Since December 2023, South Africa has been pursuing its case at the ICJ accusing Israel of committing 'state-led genocide' in its defensive war against the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. Israeli leaders have condemned the case as an 'obscene exploitation' of the Genocide Convention, noting that the Jewish state is targeting terrorists who use civilians as human shields in its military campaign. Meanwhile, South Africa’s Jewish community have lambasted the case as 'grandstanding' rather than actual concern for those killed in the Middle Eastern conflict. Last year, the ICJ ruled there was 'plausibility' to South Africa’s claims that Palestinians had a right to be protected from genocide. However, the top UN court did not make a determination on the merits of South Africa’s allegations, which may take years to go through the judicial process, nor did it call for Israel to halt its military campaign. Instead, the ICJ issued a more general directive that Israel must make sure it prevents acts of genocide. The ruling also called for the release of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the terrorist group’s invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Last month, Cuba officially became the latest country to join South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, following Ireland, Nicaragua, Colombia, Mexico, Libya, Bolivia, Turkey, the Maldives, Chile, Spain, and 'Palestine.' Since the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, the South African government has been one of the fiercest critics of Israel’s military campaign, which seeks to free the hostages kidnapped by the terrorists and dismantle Hamas’s military and administrative control in Gaza. In late 2023, South Africa temporarily withdrew its diplomats from Israel and shut down its embassy in Tel Aviv, saying the government was 'extremely concerned at the continued killing of children and innocent civilians' in Gaza. Then in December of that year, South Africa hosted two Hamas officials who attended a government-sponsored conference in solidarity with the Palestinians. One of the officials had been sanctioned by the US government for his role with the terrorist organization. Months later, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa led the crowd at an election rally in a chant of 'From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free' — a popular slogan among anti-Israel activists that has been widely interpreted as a genocidal call for the destruction of the Jewish state, which is located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.

Iran to build 1,000 nuclear sites if ‘enemy’ destroys 100, presid...	Pezeshkian also criticized the United States for pursuing a 'contradictory' approach to Iran, saying that while President Donald Trump claims he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal, he also imposes harsh sanctions on Tehran. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Thursday warned that if 'enemies' attack Iran’s nuclear facilities, the country will quickly rebuild and multiply them, seemingly responding to new reports of a possible Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites by the middle of this year. '[Enemies] threaten us that they will hit our nuclear facilities … If you strike a hundred of those, we will build a thousand other ones,' Pezeshkian said during a speech in the southern province of Bushehr, according to Iranian state media. 'You can target the buildings and locations, but you cannot target those who build them,' he said, adding that Iranian 'experts' will continue to expand the country’s nuclear program. Pezeshkian’s comments came after a Washington Post report claimed that Israel may launch a preemptive strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities in Fordow and Natanz by mid-year, citing US intelligence assessments. Such an operation could exploit extensive damage done to Iran’s military capabilities in October, when Israel devastated Iranian air defense systems and ballistic missile production facilities in a coordinated, three-wave strike. The attack was a response to Iran targeting the Israeli homeland with 181 ballistic missiles weeks earlier. During his meeting in Bushehr, Pezeshkian criticized the United States for pursuing a 'contradictory' approach to Iran, saying that while President Donald Trump claims he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal, he also imposes harsh sanctions on Tehran. 'The enemy wants us to be humiliated before them with sanctions and threats, but we will not be subjugated and we will solve our problems by relying on our people,' Pezeshkian said. 'We will run the country by relying on our domestic capabilities.' Last week, Trump signed a presidential memorandum restoring his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. However, Trump has also denied that the US and Israel are planning to carry out a military strike on Iran, saying he instead wants to reach a 'nuclear peace agreement' with Tehran. In response to Trump’s comments, Iran’s so-called 'supreme leader,' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the idea of negotiating with Washington, calling the idea 'unwise' and 'dishonorable' days later. In an interview with Fox News, Trump also mentioned the possibility of Israel striking Iran, emphasizing that he would rather reach an agreement with Tehran to stop it from obtaining nuclear weapons. 'Everyone thinks Israel, with our help or our approval, will go in and bomb the hell out of them. I would prefer that not to happen,' Trump said. Amid increasing tensions, the commander of Iran’s conventional air force, Hamid Vahedi, also threatened to retaliate against any attack on Tehran. 'We tell all countries, friends and foes alike, that our country’s doctrine is defensive, but we will respond with force against any enemy attack,' he said. The US, Israel, and other allied countries fear that Iran’s nuclear program is ultimately designed to produce nuclear bombs. Iran has claimed that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes rather than building weapons. However, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported in December that Iran had greatly accelerated uranium enrichment to up to 60 percent purity, close to the roughly 90 percent weapons-grade level, at its Fordow site dug into a mountain. The UK, France, and Germany said in a statement at the time that there is no 'credible civilian justification' for Iran’s recent nuclear activity, arguing it 'gives Iran the capability to rapidly produce sufficient fissile material for multiple nuclear weapons.' According to US intelligence reports detailed in The Wall Street Journal, US officials believe that an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities would only delay Tehran’s program for a few weeks or months, yet Israeli officials believe it would have a significant impact. Israel is reportedly considering two potential strike options, both of which would require US support for aerial refueling, intelligence gathering, and surveillance. Of these two options, one is reported to involve Israeli fighter jets launching ballistic missiles from the air without entering Iranian territory, while the other would see aircraft deploying bunker-busting bombs over Iranian nuclear sites. The Trump administration recently approved the sale of training kits for this type of strike. In November, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Iran was 'more vulnerable than ever to attacks on its nuclear facilities.' 'We have the opportunity to achieve our most important goal – to thwart and eliminate the existential threat to the State of Israel,' he said in a post on X. In my first meeting today with the @IDF General Staff Forum, I emphasized: Iran is more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities.

ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan officially sanctioned by Trump admin, b...	The ICC responded to Trump with a forceful condemnation, stressing that the court produces 'independent and impartial' work. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The United States has imposed sanctions on International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan in accordance with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump, the US Treasury Department confirmed on Thursday. Khan was sanctioned by the US after spearheading the ICC’s issuing arrest warrants for Israeli leaders over their role in the ongoing war against the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. The White House announced on Monday that Khan would be the first member of the ICC to be issued personal sanctions, and both the White House and Treasury Department noted on Thursday that he has been added to the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. Khan’s assets in the United States are now frozen, and he is banned from entering the country. The announcement came on the heels of Trump’s executive order last week to punish members of the ICC for targeting Israel. Trump’s order lambasted the ICC for its 'illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.' Trump stated that the ICC 'abused its power' to pursue an unsubstantiated and politically motivated criminal case against Israeli leaders. The ICC responded to Trump with a forceful condemnation, stressing that the court produces 'independent and impartial' work. 'The court stands firmly by its personnel and pledges to continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world,' the ICC said. Trump signed the executive order after Senate Democrats blocked legislation to sanction the ICC in January. The bill ultimately failed by a vote of 54-45, with Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) being the sole Democrat to vote in favor of punishing the ICC. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) criticized the bill as 'poorly drafted and deeply problematic.' The House had passed the legislation. In November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and now-deceased Hamas terror leader Ibrahim al-Masri (better known as Mohammed Deif) for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. The ICC said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for starvation in Gaza and the persecution of Palestinians — charges vehemently denied by Israel, which has provided significant humanitarian aid into the war-torn enclave throughout the war. US and Israeli officials issued blistering condemnations of the ICC move, decrying the court for drawing a moral equivalence between Israel’s democratically elected leaders and the heads of Hamas, the Palestinian terrorist group that launched the ongoing war in Gaza with its massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The ICC has no jurisdiction over Israel as it is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the court. Other countries including the US have similarly not signed the ICC charter. However, the ICC has asserted jurisdiction by accepting 'Palestine' as a signatory in 2015, despite no such state being recognized under international law.

‘We’re very lucky you’re here,’ Vance tells Holocaust survivor on...	The visit included a tour, history and a wreath-laying ceremony next to a large metal sculpture of seven contorted bodies labeled '1933-1945,' the years the camp operated, per the pool. By Izzy Salant, JNS U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, met with Abba Naor, a Holocaust survivor, and with Karl Freller, the director of the Bavarian Memorial Foundation, and other officials at Dachau, the site of a former concentration camp in Germany, on Thursday. 'You look better than I do, and I’m 40,' Vance told Naor, per the pool report. The report noted that the two spoke, as it snowed lightly, in front of a gate with the sign 'Arbeit macht frei' and that most of the discussion was inaudible to the pool. Vance’s visit follows Mike Pence’s and Joe Biden’s when they were vice president, per the Associated Press. (Kamala Harris did not appear to visit the site, per public reports.) A guide told the vice president and his wife that prisoners 'had to cede everything they had with them' and showed the two 'a display filled with the effects of a prisoner from Czechoslovakia,' per the pool. Vance 'asked the guide: ‘Do we know what happened to him after the war?’ The guide says he survived but that he wasn’t exactly sure about the details,' it added. 'Mrs. Vance asked if there were any special provisions for survivors after the war. The guide replied that people who returned to Communist countries behind the Iron Curtain weren’t always treated well and that their loyalties were questioned.' Naor showed Vance a card with his prisoner information and said, 'I’m still here,' per the pool. 'Well, we’re very lucky you’re here,' Vance said, putting his hand on Naor’s shoulder. The visit included a tour, history and a wreath-laying ceremony next to a large metal sculpture of seven contorted bodies labeled '1933-1945,' the years the camp operated, per the pool. Vance laid a wreath with a red, white and blue ribbon stenciled with 'We remember' and 'United States of America' in gold lettering, per the AP. Inside the camp, the delegation was shown the intake area of the concentration camp, which also featured a large map of the Nazi concentration camp network per the pool. 'I’ve read a lot about the Holocaust in books, but being here and seeing it up close in person really drives home what unspeakable evil was committed, and why we should be committed to ensuring that it never happens again,' Vance said, per the AP. 'Moving visit to Dachau Memorial underscoring U.S. commitment to Holocaust remembrance and commemorating the 80th anniversary of the camp’s liberation by U.S. forces on April 29, 1945,' stated the U.S. embassy in Berlin. The embassy added that Vance and his wife 'were touched by meeting Abba Noar, one of the last remaining Holocaust survivors.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was also scheduled to be in Germany on Thursday to take part in the Munich Security Conference and the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, per the U.S. State Department. Rubio is also slated to travel to Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, from Feb. 15 to 18, per the State Department. 'Secretary Rubio’s engagements with senior officials will promote U.S. interests in advancing regional cooperation, stability and peace,' Foggy Bottom added. 'The trip will center on freeing American and all other hostages from Hamas captivity, advancing to Phase II of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and countering the destabilizing activities of the Iranian regime and its proxies.'

Trump announces Israel-India trade route running through Israel	Trump: 'It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the U.S., connecting our partners, roads, railways, and undersea cables.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, U.S. President Donald Trump declared that a new trade route between the two countries—passing through Israel—will be 'the greatest in history.' 'It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the U.S., connecting our partners, roads, railways, and undersea cables,' Trump said while meeting Modi at the White House. Trump acknowledged that the trade route would be 'costly,' but emphasized that it is crucial for the countries to 'stay advanced and remain the leader.' The President also expressed confidence that the friendship between Israel and India is 'the strongest it has ever been.' He added that they would discuss the long-standing trade disparities between the two countries and expected 'wonderful trade deals' in the future. 'We’ll begin negotiations to address the long-standing disparities that should have been resolved over the past four years,' stated the U.S. President. Additionally, Trump announced that the U.S. would begin selling fighter jets to India. 'Starting this year, we’ll significantly increase military sales to India by billions of dollars. We're also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters,' Trump said. Minister of Economy and Industry, Nir Barkat, traveled to India with Israel's largest business delegation on Monday. The two-day visit is aimed at strengthening economic relations between Israel and India, expanding trade opportunities, and fostering technological collaboration. The delegation's departure marks a new phase in the growing economic partnership between the two nations. 'The departure of this economic delegation to India represents a critical step in enhancing our ties, boosting Israel’s economy through increased exports, and lowering living costs by expanding imports,' said Barkat. 'At the invitation of Indian Economy Minister Piyush Goyal, we are embarking on a mission to unlock new markets, boost trade, and eliminate barriers.'

US Sec of State Rubio invites Arab States that don’t like Trump G...	All these countries claim to care about Palestinians, but none of them are willing to take any in. None have a history of doing anything for Gaza,' Rubio said. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News U.S. Senator Marco Rubio invited Arab nations to propose a post-war plan for Gaza, especially if they are critical of U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Gaza's civilian population. Arab nations have expressed disapproval of Trump’s plan, which calls for the U.S. to take control and rebuild Gaza, while relocating its civilian population to neighboring countries. After meeting with President Trump, King Abdullah of Jordan agreed to take in 2,000 sick Gazan children, though he opposed relocating the broader Gaza population. Rubio made these remarks before departing on a trip to the Middle East, where he is set to meet with leaders from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel. He stated that the purpose of the trip was to explore potential solutions to the Gaza conflict and its aftermath. Speaking on the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton radio show, Rubio said, 'Hopefully they’ll have a strong plan to present to the president,' referring to Arab nations. 'The only plan right now — which they don’t like — is the Trump plan. So, if they have a better plan, now is the time to present it.' In response to Trump's relocation proposal, Arab officials emphasized their solidarity with the Palestinian people. Rubio argued that if these nations truly care for Palestinians, they should offer a viable solution for post-war Gaza. 'All these countries claim to care about Palestinians, but none of them are willing to take any in. None have a history of doing anything for Gaza,' Rubio added. Rubio also acknowledged that many Arab states are acting in good faith to find solutions, but he emphasized that the future of Gaza cannot include Hamas as a political or military power. 'If the countries in the region can’t address that issue, then Israel will have to step in, and we’ll end up back where we’ve been,' he said. On Tuesday, Egyptian officials announced they were preparing a 'comprehensive proposal' for Gaza that would not involve relocating its civilian population.

Siblani is a vocal critic of Israel and was a leader in the 'uncommitted' movement that opposed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris over U.S. support for Israel in its war with the terrorist group Hamas. By Chuck Ross, The Washington Free Beacon One of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s (D.) guests on an official state trip to the Middle East this week is an anti-Israel activist who hailed the leader of Hezbollah as a 'hero' and recently called for Jews to be sent 'back to Poland.' Whitmer took 17 local officials, businessmen, community leaders, and the head of the Michigan National Guard on a trip to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to strengthen economic ties to the region. A press release and photos from the first day of the trip show that one of Whitmer’s hand-picked guests was Osama Siblani, the publisher of the Arab American News. Whitmer's 2025 official state trip to the Middle East, including Osama Siblani (Governor Gretchen Whitmer / Facebook). It’s a controversial choice for Whitmer, considered a top contender for the Democratic presidential primary in 2028. Siblani is a vocal critic of Israel and was a leader in the 'uncommitted' movement that opposed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris over U.S. support for Israel in its war with the terrorist group Hamas. And Siblani has gone far beyond simple criticism of the Jewish state. Siblani has for years defended and praised Hamas and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terrorist groups. At a rally in Dearborn he organized on Sept. 25, Siblani hailed then-Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah as a 'hero.' 'They want us to be afraid of praising our leaders and martyrs, but today we say to them that our martyrs are heroes and our leaders are great, especially the great Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah,' Siblani said of the Hezbollah leader who was assassinated in an Israeli airstrike days later. After chants of 'death to Israel' broke out during Siblani’s speech, Siblani responded, 'Believe me, they will take care of the job,' an apparent reference to Hezbollah, according to the Middle East Media Research Institute. And he issued a message to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Jews: 'We will take you back to Poland.' In 2022, Siblani urged Arabs to 'fight within [their] means' against Israel, whether with 'stones,' 'guns,' or 'their hands.' He has bragged that he refused to condemn Hamas during a conference call with Biden White House officials in 2021. Siblani’s rhetoric should be no secret to Whitmer, who will leave office next year. The Anti-Defamation League and other Jewish groups have condemned Siblani’s remarks over the years and blasted the White House and Biden campaign last year for sending officials to meet with Siblani in Dearborn in hopes of gaining his political support. Whitmer may like to stay in Siblani’s good graces, given his influence within Michigan’s large Arab and Muslim community and her apparent presidential ambitions. Siblani has published Arab American News, the largest Arab-language newspaper in the country, since 1984 and frequently hosts rallies and other events in Dearborn, one of the nation’s largest Muslim-majority cities. Democrats consider Michigan part of their 'Blue Wall' path to winning the Electoral College, making the state’s Arab and Muslim vote key to victory. But Whitmer’s coziness with a terrorist sympathizer may not play well in other battleground states. Whitmer has catered to Siblani throughout her tenure. In 2022, she met with Siblani at his newspaper’s office after he publicly criticized her for visiting Israel. 'Governor Whitmer will hear from us soon on her wrong and offensive trip to Israel as its army brutally killing [sic] innocent Palestinians including children while carpet bombing Gaza,' Siblani said. He published photos after their one-on-one meeting and said Whitmer accepted his invitation to visit Arab countries. It’s unclear who paid for Siblani’s attendance on the trip. Whitmer’s other guests on the Middle Eastern trip include Maj. Gen. Paul D. Rogers, the adjutant general of the Michigan National Guard, and a variety of city and county officials from around Michigan. Several other attendees have been highly critical of Israel, including Wayne County executive Warren Evans and deputy county executive Assad Turfe. Last year, Evans and Turfe were spotted in the front row at anti-Semitic preacher Louis Farrakhan’s speech in Detroit, where the Nation of Islam leader claimed that the United States is 'enslaved' to Jews.

‘Students Against Nazi Extremism’ target Tesla cars in California...	In Europe, where Tesla has significant market presence, the response has been particularly fierce. By Jewish Breaking News California Tesla owners have become unwitting targets in the controversy still surrounding Elon Musk’s Nazi-like salute and his mounting influence in Washington. According to an investigative report by The Independent, a fringe group has been leaving notes on Tesla cars in the Bay Area with the words 'No Nazis in America,' with at least one tied to a brick. Calling themselves 'Students Against Nazi Extremism,' the group mailed a manifesto to local news outlet Lost Coast Outpost claiming responsibility for delivering threats to 13 Tesla owners across Arcata and Seaside. The three-page document denounced Musk as an 'overt Nazi with a history of fascist, racist, misogynist and criminal behavior' and outlined plans to vandalize Tesla vehicles in Rohnert Park and Hayward. Meanwhile, the anti-Tesla movement has now spread beyond California, with protesters gathering outside Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Manhattan and Maine, voicing their opposition to what they view as the billionaire overreach into federal government affairs.

Outside Barcelona, French artist James Kina installed a provocative red raised arm at a Tesla charging station. In Germany, an image of Musk’s inauguration day Nazi-like salute was projected onto the exterior wall of a Tesla factory in Berlin, accompanied by the word 'heil.' Musk’s vocal support of the far-right AfD party has already sparked significant backlash from moderate and liberal Germans.

80-year old freed hostage Gadi Moses describes walking 7km, solvi...	At some point, he realized he had to stop expecting immediate rescue and shift his focus to surviving each day. He taught himself to think differently.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Freed hostage, 80-year-old Gadi Moses, kept himself occupied during his captivity by walking seven kilometers a day in his tiny room and solving complex math problems in his head. Moses' nephew, Shai, said in an interview, 'At some point, he realized he had to stop expecting immediate rescue and shift his focus to surviving each day. He taught himself to think differently, to keep pushing forward, and to avoid the crushing disappointment of not being freed the next morning.' Moses had only learned of the murder of his long-term partner, Efrat Katz, 68, during his captivity and discovered that his daughter, Moran, had survived the Hamas invasion on October 7th when he was freed after 483 days. Although Moses was not held in tunnels like other hostages, he was confined in isolation in a tiny, dark, unsanitary room and given very little food. To comfort himself, Moses would have imaginary conversations with his loved ones. He hadn’t had any contact with another Israeli until he was escorted by Arbel Yehoud, 29, amid chaotic and hostile crowds in Gaza prior to their release. Moses talked to his captors and even negotiated access to a television, where he saw Israelis protesting for the release of hostages. This gave him strength and helped him understand that the nation was fighting for their return home. An agronomist and potato expert, Moses told his captors that, when the war ended and if peace were achieved, he would teach them how to farm. He also fearlessly debated the terrorists about the ownership of the land of Israel. The Hamas captors taunted him, asking, 'Where are your parents from? Go back there!' When they asserted that their ancestors lived in the land before the Jews, Moses responded, 'What are you talking about? Our people lived in these places 3,000 years ago!'

Lebanese government prevents Iranian plane with funds for Hezboll...	The Lebanese government is fulfilling a provision in the ceasefire agreement with Israel, which requires it to prevent Iran from transferring funds to Hezbollah. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Lebanese government is preventing a plane scheduled to fly to Beirut from leaving Tehran's airport due to suspicions that it is being used to transfer funds to Hezbollah, according to reports from Arab media. By stopping the plane from flying to Beirut, the Lebanese government is fulfilling a provision in the ceasefire agreement with Israel, which requires it to prevent Iran from transferring funds to the Lebanese terror group. Passengers at Tehran's airport protested the fact that the plane was prevented from traveling on its scheduled route. Hezbollah supporters gathered outside the airport, waving flags associated with the terror group, protesting the decision by blocking the road and burning tires. IDF Arabic Language Spokesman Avichay Adraee revealed that Hezbollah and the Iranian Quds Force have been using international flights to receive funds from Iran. 'The IDF stays in communication with the ceasefire monitoring mechanism and regularly shares detailed information to disrupt these transfers. Despite these efforts, we believe that some of these money-smuggling attempts have been successful,' Adraee stated. He declared, 'The IDF will prevent Hezbollah from arming itself and will use all available means to enforce the ceasefire agreements, ensuring the security of Israel's citizens.' Iran is attempting to rebuild its weakened proxy group, Hezbollah, by flying millions of dollars to the terror organization through Beirut International Airport, a practice that the IDF has warned must stop immediately. The discovery of Iran transferring funds to terror groups through commercial flights comes just days before the deadline for Israel to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon. A Trump administration official recently confirmed that Washington expects the IDF to leave the region by February 18. However, reports suggest that Israel is lobbying to extend that deadline. Displaced residents of northern Israel’s border region, who were evacuated from their homes shortly after the October 7, 2023, terror onslaught, have still been unable to return to their communities. The Israeli government set March 1st as the date by which displaced northerners are expected to return home, but that timeframe now appears unlikely.

Burned trees, traumatized animals: Nature is revealing the unseen...	Every winter, around 50,000 common cranes pause their migration to Africa to settle in the Hula Valley, but last year, relentless rocket fire from Lebanon—just 30 kilometers away—caused their numbers to plummet by 70%. By Deborah Danan, JTA The trees abutting the road leading to Biriya Forest, a nature preserve in northern Israel, at first resemble spruces turning autumnal shades of red, a sight reminiscent of landscapes in America or Europe but rare in Israel. A closer look, however, reveals that the trees are only charred remnants — the devastating result of rocket-induced wildfires that destroyed thousands of acres of forest while Israel battled Hezbollah in Lebanon. Fires break out every year in this forest, which like many others across Israel was planted by the Jewish National Fund, known today as KKL-JNF — but they are usually brought under control quickly. This year, with the local population evacuated and weather conditions unusually extreme, things played out differently. Starting around May, as temperatures rose, nearly every rocket fired from Lebanon was likely to ignite a fire. And it wasn’t just the rockets themselves: Israeli interceptors exploded overhead, scattering fragments that ignited at multiple points within the forest. The combination of unusual winds, scorching heat and low humidity created a perfect storm that has disrupted entire ecosystems, affected wildlife habitats and undone years of work by foresters aimed at increasing biodiversity. 'We literally witnessed their life’s work go up in smoke,' said Eli Hafuta, director of the Upper Galilee and Golan Region at KKL-JNF, which was founded in 1901 to cultivate Jewish-owned land in the region and today owns 13% of all land in Israel. 'It’s a devastating sight to watch trees that have stood for 70 or 80 years go up in flames,' Hafuta said. 'Even younger trees, ones my team and I planted just a decade ago, can be reduced to ashes in just 15 minutes.' The scorched earth in Biriya Forest reflects just one of many environmental effects of nearly a year and a half of war for Israel. Less visible than the lives lost, injuries sustained and homes destroyed has been devastation to flora and fauna in both Israel’s north and south. The cascading effects continued this week as the splashy kickoff for a new forest in the western Negev to honor war victims, timed to the Jewish environmental holiday of Tu Bishvat on Thursday, was canceled amid rising security threats in the region. A handful of Israeli officials are instead holding a smaller planting ceremony in the western Negev, at a site named for an officer killed on Oct. 7, 2023. Perhaps nowhere has the war’s effect on Israeli ecosystems been more pronounced than at the Agamon Hula Valley Nature Reserve, famed for its mesmerizing bird migrations. Twice a year, hundreds of millions of birds — including cranes, pelicans, and storks — pass through the valley, in a normal year turning it into a hotspot for ecotourism, with the BBC naming it one of the top 10 birdwatching sites in the world. During the months it was closed — from Oct. 7, 2023, until well after the ceasefire on Israel’s northern border took hold in late November — the Agamon Wildlife Rehabilitation Center on the reserve turned into what staff call the world’s first wartime field hospital for animals. 'We’re the first rehabilitation center in the world with a war protocol,' said Dr. Rona Nadler-Valency, the center’s head veterinarian and director. When rockets pounded the north, Nadler-Valency and her team were evacuated from their communities, forcing the center to operate remotely, with staff caring for injured animals at home when possible. After three months, the team began returning, resuming treatment at the center under a chaotic new normal. 'We would be in the middle of surgery, an animal on the operating table, when the sirens would go off,' Nadler-Valency said. 'We’d have to leave everything and run to the shelter — sometimes dozens of times a day.' At other times, Nadler-Valency and her team were caught outdoors when sirens sounded, forcing them to drop to the ground for cover. 'Those moments felt like pure insanity, but at least we were able to keep doing our work,' she said. With so few civilians remaining in the north, many of the wounded animals were brought to the center by soldiers. In one case, Lilit, a tawny owl brought in after being hit by a military vehicle, suffered a severe head injury that temporarily left her blind and deaf. Lilit was carefully monitored and rehabilitated in a specialized acclimation cage. Treatment was complicated by the ongoing missile fire, requiring the team to carefully time their visits to her, but eventually the team managed to restore her sight, hearing and flight. After a month and a half in the cage, Lilit was released back into the wild with a transmitter on her back, allowing the team to track her recovery and ensure she could hunt and survive, as well as gain insights into how owls adjust to life after similar injuries. 'Cases like Lilit’s,' Nadler-Valency reflected, 'were rays of light amid the madness.' The disruption fueled other changes that scientists are now tracking. Yaron Charka, chief ornithologist at KKL-JNF — which manages the reserve and its reopened visitors’ center — observed an increase in wintering bird species this year. 'I’m seeing a great variety of birds this winter, compared with last winter, where there were few,' he said, but acknowledged that he didn’t fully understand why. Every winter, some 50,000 common cranes settle in the Hula Valley, pausing their southward migration to Africa. But last year, that number dropped by 70% amid constant rocket fire from Lebanon, just 30 kilometers from the valley. Still, Charka cautioned against attributing all of the changes to the cross-border clashes. 'During wartime, birds can change their route and bypass us in isolated instances — we saw this with Ukraine — but it’s not the whole picture,' he said, noting that the ceasefire came at the end of the migratory season and emphasizing that climate change, which is having an outsized effect on Israel, is also causing changes in the cranes’ migration habits. 'In the past two years, the arrival of the crane flocks in the fall to the Hula Valley has been significantly delayed,' he said. 'It is important that we continue to monitor this trend.' The site’s extended closure left the cranes unaccustomed to humans, so camouflaged wagons now help visitors observe them closely while minimizing disturbance. With the return of crane populations comes the resurgence of old problems, particularly the challenge of protecting local crops from the birds. Farmers have long used methods such as gas cannons and mirrors to divert the cranes to designated feeding sites, but these approaches are costly and disruptive — both to wildlife and to tourists. Now, KKL-JNF Jewish National Fund is developing a laser-based system to address the issue more sustainably. The technology, developed in conjunction with an Israeli ecotech company, employs cameras, lasers and artificial intelligence to detect crane presence and direct a laser beam that the birds perceive as chasing them, causing them to relocate. Charka, who used to work in tech, said he hoped to see the system fully operational by the next migration season. According to the reserve’s director, Inbar Shlomit Rubin, far fewer bird nests were observed in the spring — a trend for which she saw two immediate explanations. 'The unrest and insecurity led many birds to migrate further south to quieter areas of Israel,' she said. But mammals and smaller animals had no means of escaping the area. 'The noise of the war caused immense stress,' Rubin said. 'Stress negatively affects fertility.' Since the ceasefire, KKL-JNF has launched an extensive survey of the areas burned over the past year to evaluate their potential for natural regeneration. For now, most of the organization’s efforts are focused on urgent interventions in visitor-accessible areas. While the restoration of the affected areas is expected to be a long-term endeavor, Hafuta expressed optimism, highlighting forests’ remarkable ability to regenerate. He said he estimated that as many as 70% of burned trees would begin to regenerate naturally in the next year and a half. According to Rubin, in recent weeks, wildlife, too, has begun returning to the affected areas. 'We’ve noticed a very subtle, minimal return. While the long-term effects are still uncertain, we remain hopeful that [the war] won’t have a significant impact in the years to come,' Rubin said. 'The trauma the area experienced will take time to heal, but we are on the right path.'

Red Sox sign Jewish All-Star to record breaking $120 million deal	Since 2017, he’s played at least 145 games in every full season except one, missing time only during the pandemic-shortened 2020 schedule. By Jewish Breaking News The Boston Red Sox answered their critics on Wednesday Since 2017, he’s played at least 145 games in every full season except one, missing time only during the pandemic-shortened 2020 schedule.by signing Gold Glove winner Alex Bregman to a whopping 3-year, $120 million deal. It brings one of baseball’s most visible Jewish stars to Fenway Park after eight standout seasons with the Houston Astros. Drafted second overall in 2015, Bregman quickly became a cornerstone of Houston’s dynasty. After his 2016 call-up, he emerged as a consistent force in the lineup as a third baseman, helping power World Series victories in both 2017 and 2022. His Jewish identity took center stage when he drew a Star of David on his cap following the October 7 Hamas massacre. Power and consistency define Bregman’s offensive approach. He’s crossed the 20-homer threshold in each of the past three seasons. Bregman’s 13.6% strikeout rate ranked in the 94th percentile. His ability to square up pitches placed him 10th among 211 qualified hitters. Beyond the numbers, Bregman brings remarkable durability and playoff experience to Boston. Since 2017, he’s played at least 145 games in every full season except one, missing time only during the pandemic-shortened 2020 schedule. According to ESPN insider Jeff Passan, Bregman is expected to shift to second base, a position he’s played just 32 innings in his major league career. With stars Rafael Devers at third base and Triston Casas at first, Red Sox brass is betting big on Bregman’s successful transition to second base will help return Boston to contention after last year’s mediocre 81-81 finish.

Israel launches three new medical schools to address shortage of ...	According to Nadav Davidovich, Chair of the Taub Center Health Policy Program and Director of the School of Public Health at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel currently gets around 1,300 new doctors per year, with a need of around 2,000. By Anna Epshtein, TPS Israel is opening three new medical schools to address the country’s shortage of medical personnel. One, at the private Reichman University in Herzliya, welcomed its first students ten days ago. Two others, at Haifa University and Weizmann Institute of Science, are to open in October 2025. 'The opening of new medical schools is a significant development that will greatly contribute to the future of Israel’s healthcare system. Increasing the number of medical students will help reduce gaps, strengthen public healthcare, and ensure quality and accessible medical service for every citizen,' the Health Ministry said in a statement, praising the Council for Higher Education that approved the move. The School of Medicine at Reichman University, which opened on February 2, 2025, enrolls 88 graduate students who already have a BA degree in a four-year program. Weizmann Institute of Science will accommodate 40 graduate students in the first year of the program. The students will undergo clinical practice in several Israeli hospitals, including Sheba Medical Center, the largest in Israel. They will be eligible for a double degree—Doctor of Medicine and Doctorate in Research (MDPhD). 'The vision is to create a new generation of leading physician-researchers in the field of medicine and biomedical research. These will be professionals capable of identifying urgent clinical challenges, inviting patients to participate in current clinical trials, and planning and conducting innovative studies that will lead to groundbreaking medical solutions, all with the aim of promoting public health,' the Weizmann Institute statement said. The University of Haifa will accommodate 66 students in the first year and plans to increase enrollment to several dozen students in the coming years. Carmel Medical Center in Haifa will serve as its clinical base. The students will also practice at the medical centers of Clalit Health Services, the largest of Israel’s four state-mandated health service organizations. 'We hope the students will stay in the north after the six years of their studies here,' Roni Malkai, the University’s spokesperson, told TPS-IL. The shortage of medical personnel is especially acute in the Israeli periphery. 'In central Israel, the numbers per capita are close to those in OECD countries, but in the south and the north, they are up to two times lower,' Nadav Davidovich, Chair of the Taub Center Health Policy Program and Director of the School of Public Health at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev explained to TPS-IL. According to him, Israel currently gets around 1,300 new doctors per year, with a need of around 2,000. The shortage of medical personnel is a result of several factors, one of which is that thousands of doctors who came to Israel with the wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s have been retiring. 'The problem is not just the numbers but also the quality of education. Only about 40 percent of practicing doctors in Israel got their diploma in the country,' Davidovich explained. 'The rest studied abroad because there are not enough places in Israel, including in countries where education is poor. They often end up in the Israeli periphery, too.' Establishing new schools is not the only way to address the problem. Israel has also opened programs for physician assistants, who take less time than a full MD, and nurse practitioners (NPs). According to a report published in Israel Health Policy Research a year ago, the number of physicians per capita in Israel is lower than in the OECD countries—3.1 versus 3.5 per 1,000 population, respectively. 'There is a decrease in the supply of physicians in Israel resulting from the declining flow of immigrant physicians from the former Soviet Union, a large proportion of whom have reached retirement age in recent years. This problem could become worse because the number of medical students in Israel cannot increase quickly, especially because the number of clinical training sites is inadequate. The rapid population growth and anticipated aging will exacerbate the shortage,' the report said.

Two Arab Israelis arrested on charges of planning Hamas terror at...	According to the investigation, one of the suspects purchased materials to make fire bombs and 'conducted tests' to produce explosive charges with the intent to attack a bus transporting Israeli troops. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Two Arab Israelis have been arrested on suspicion of planning a series of terrorist attacks against security forces and civilians, the Israel Police and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) revealed in a statement on Thursday. The suspects, aged 18 and 21, from the towns of Qalansawe and Zemer in central Israel, expressed support for the Hamas terror group following its Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, according to the statement. The two had planned several attacks, including 'a shooting at a military facility and a combined ramming and shooting attack targeting IDF soldiers or civilians,' it continued. According to the investigation, one of the suspects purchased materials to make fire bombs and 'conducted tests' to produce explosive charges with the intent to attack a bus transporting Israeli troops. Following the arrests, a court extended the suspects’ detention. Charges were set to be filed against them on Thursday. In November, two minors from Israel’s 'triangle region' were indicted on charges of conspiring to carry out terrorist acts against security forces. The triangle region contains 11 Arab Israeli communities adjacent to the Green Line and the Samaria security barrier, including Qalansawe and Zemer, and is home to approximately 250,000 people. According to the indictment, one of the minors was recruited to a terror cell in August 2023. He allegedly received training in explosives and subsequently acquired chemical materials to conduct experiments. He then recruited three additional members, including the second minor in the indictment. The pair allegedly worked in collaboration with others, attempted to make bombs and demonstrated an intent to cause harm. Since the start of the Iron Swords war 16 months ago, there has been growing radicalization among some segments of the country’s Arab population. A poll conducted in December 2023 by the Israel Democracy Institute’s Center for Democratic Values and Institutions discovered that one-third of Israel’s Arabs disagree with the statement that the Oct. 7 attack 'does not reflect Arab society, the Palestinian people and the Islamic nation.' According to a June poll, some 14.7% of Arab Israelis believe Hamas should govern Gaza after the war. That number represents some 308,700 Israeli citizens out of an Arab Israeli population of around 2.1 million.

Afghan man arrested after running down dozens in Munich	1 dead, dozens more injured after Afghan migrant rams crowd of labor union protesters in Munich, Germany. By World Israel News Staff At least one person was killed and dozens more injured after a car plowed through a crowd in the city of Munich, Germany on Thursday. The incident occurred near Köingsplatz when a Mini Cooper rammed into a group of labor union protesters representing Verdi, Germany's largest public sector union, who had gathered in Munich to demand wage hikes for teachers and hospital workers. Local reports claim that one woman was killed in the incident, while 28 others were injured. Munich police said Thursday that they arrested the driver of the car, a 24-year-old male migrant from Afghanistan. Markus Söder, premier of the State of Bavaria, told reporters that the ramming was 'likely an attack.' 'The attack shows that something has to change in Germany - and quickly.' Police say the suspect has a history of criminal activity including drug-related offenses and theft. Germany's Der Spiegel reported that the suspect has been living in Germany since 2016, despite his asylum request having been rejected. Local media outlets have claimed the suspect posted radical Islamist materials to his social media accounts. The incident comes just ten days before German voters head to the polls, after snap elections were called following the collapse of the Social Democrats-led center-left government. Immigration is expected to play a major role in this month's federal election, with pre-election polling indicating the right-wing Alternative For Germany (AfD) is poised to become the second largest faction in the Bundestag. Alice Weidel, chairwoman of the AfD and the party's candidate for chancellor, said the attack highlighted the need to radically reform Germany's immigration policies. 'The terror driver from Munich was an Afghan asylum seeker known to police,' Weidel tweeted. 'Once again there are many seriously injured, once again women and children among the victims. My deepest sympathy goes out to the victims and their families. Should this continue forever? Migration turnaround now!'

Ex-IDF deputy chief accuses Netanyahu’s office of treason	Yair Golan, who leads the far-left party The Democrats and once served as deputy chief of the IDF, calls for investigation of Prime Minister Netanyahu's office, accusing aides of betraying Israel to Qatar. By World Israel News Staff A former Israeli lawmaker and chief of a far-left party in the Israeli Knesset accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's staff of treason on Thursday, and called for a criminal investigation of the Prime Minister's Office, citing aides' alleged financial ties to Qatar. Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of staff of the Israeli military who served as a deputy minister in the Bennett-Lapid government and became the head of the far-left The Democrats party last year, held a press conference Thursday afternoon accusing Netanyahu's office of betraying the State of Israel and demanding police launch a criminal probe. 'There is a suspicion of betrayal in the Prime Minister's Office that must be investigated,' Golan said. 'The recent revelation is not another failure, it is not another corruption event or political scandal, and it is not a misjudgment – it is allegedly evidence of a business, financial, and personal connection between the Prime Minister's Office and an enemy state before and during the war,' Golan said, noting Qatar's long-standing ties to Hamas. 'Netanyahu's closest advisors – people from the most important office in the State of Israel – allegedly received payments, maintained connections, and did business with the country that funded Hamas, a country whose leader sees Sheikh Qaradawi, a declared antisemite and prominent Israel-hater, as its spiritual teacher.' Golan held the press conference two days after Israel's Channel 12 published a report accusing PMO staffer Eli Feldstein, who worked on Netanyahu's media team, of having worked as part of a public relations team on behalf of Qatar while employed by the PMO. Feldstein is currently under house arrest in connection to the alleged leaking of government documents to the German daily Bild. Three months earlier, a report by Ha'aretz accused two other PMO employees, Yonatan Urich and Srulik Einhorn, of providing public relations services to Qatar prior to the 2022 World Cup, held in Qatar. Under the international soccer league FIFA's rules, Qatar was required to permit Israel's team and Israeli fans to enter the country, despite Doha having no official diplomatic ties to Israel at the time. A temporary Israeli consulate was established in Qatar for the World Cup to provide basic services for visiting Israelis.

Knesset backs bill to deport illegal Eritrean immigrants	Israeli parliament votes unanimously to advance legislation to deport illegal immigrants from Eritrea who express support for their native land's regime. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A bill to deport Eritreans who illegally entered Israel if they support their home government passed a preliminary reading in the Knesset 51-0 Wednesday. Yulia Malinovsky of the Opposition’s Israel Beytenu party, who submitted the proposed law in December, wrote in its explanatory portion that 'an infiltrator who supports the Eritrean regime, from which he fled on the grounds that his life was in danger, is not truly in danger and therefore is not entitled to reside in the State of Israel.' The bill allows the Interior Minister to deport such infiltrators either to their homeland or to a third country after proving that they support the regime, and it supplied several examples of such backing: organizing or participating in an event whose purpose is to show support for the government of President Isaias Afwerki, including events sponsored by the Eritrean embassy, and/or waving a picture of the country’s leader. The bill also gives the minister the right to immediately deport infiltrators if they have been convicted of an offense, whether they have been sentenced to prison time for committing the crime or not. All infiltrators notified of the intent to deport them will have the right to a hearing to present their arguments against such action. According to data from the Population and Immigration Authority, there are currently about 19,000 asylum seekers in Israel from Eritrea, and another 4,000 from Sudan. It is not known exactly how many of the illegal migrants back Afwerki, who has ruled the one-party state since Eritrea declared independence in 1993. However, there have been mass, violent melees between regime supporters and opponents in recent years, especially where the migrant community is concentrated in south Tel Aviv. In September 2023, there was a massive riot in the city in which some 200 brawlers were injured, many storefronts were damaged and widespread looting occurred. Just a few weeks later, two migrants were murdered in separate clashes in Netanya and Tel Aviv, with police in full riot gear needed to break up the violence. South Tel Aviv was the site of yet another deadly riot last May, when 50 police officers and more than 160 Eritreans were injured from being clubbed, knifed or shot. Last month, Ynet reported that the Eritrean government has paid financial guarantees to release supporters arrested in Israel following incidents of violence, theft, vandalism, and other crimes. Residents of southern Tel Aviv have been complaining for well over a decade about their inability to live normal lives among the thousands of mostly young, single illegal migrants who have taken over the streets. They have accused the police of ignoring their plight instead of showing a robust presence and thoroughly investigating all reported crimes, which have included sexual assault and rape, as well as the more common house break-ins and muggings. Malinovsky said that the bill’s preliminary passage was 'the first step in returning safety and quiet to the residents of south Tel Aviv. It is inconceivable that Israeli citizens are too afraid to leave their homes after dark.'

How USAID laundered money to the Taliban	The money-laundering operation required multiple steps and plausible deniability for USAID, the State Department, and the UN. By Daniel Greenfield, Frontpage Magazine In 2022, the DA Afghanistan Bank showed off photos of $40 million in stacks of hundred dollar bills sitting on the tarmac at Kabul International Airport. The Taliban controlled central bank described this as one of three shipments of 'humanitarian aid' amounting to over $100 million. DAB, Afghanistan’s central bank, was headed by Noor Ahmad Agha, a 'specially designated terrorist' who had been named as the 'financier of bomb-making', including the IEDs which had killed over 1,000 American soldiers, and sending money to a sanctioned figure was illegal. Despite that someone had sent a massive fortune in U.S. cash to the Taliban’s terror bank. While no international organization was willing to admit to the cash-smuggling operation, the ultimate responsibility lay with USAID. The $40 million on the tarmac was part of a much larger scheme under which USAID and the State Department provided over $1.7 billion in funding to the UN which then shipped $2.9 billion in cash to Afghanistan. The cash had to be physically shipped because it was illegal for U.S. banks to provide it to the Taliban. USAID was helping finance an illegal operation to circumvent sanctions on terrorists. Following a series of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, today, December 15, 2021, the fourth shipment of humanitarian aid of USD 19.2 million reached Afghanistan and delivered to the Afghanistan International Bank (AIB). pic.twitter.com/ng3IH3ZhS0 &mdash; Da Afghanistan Bank- Afghanistan (@AFGCentralbank) December 15, 2021 When the State Department and USAID claimed that they 'do not provide assistance to or through the Taliban' but work 'with trusted international partners with extensive experience working in challenging environments like Afghanistan', it was a half-truth at best. The 'trusted international partners' included the UN. USAID funded the UN which used an intermediary to purchase the hundred dollar bills from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where Afghanistan’s wealth, claimed by the Taliban, was being held, then contracted with a company, quite possibly Osama bin Laden’s old airline, to fly it to Afghanistan, deposit it in banks, allocate it to NGOs and then use DAB to convert the dollars into local Afghan currency. This Afghan currency was also provided by the United States which funded the printing of 20 billion in Taliban currency by European companies for which the dollars would be exchanged. 'The United States and our partners have been working hard with international banks to facilitate payment transfers from Afghanistan’s central bank to European printing companies,' State Department spokesman Ned Price had told reporters. 'This will address one of the aspects of Afghanistan’s ongoing liquidity crisis, consistent with U.S. efforts to support basic human needs.' Rather than just the ‘foreign aid’ to Afghanistan in the form of the ‘Afghanis’ that it was already arranging to print for the Taliban, the Biden administration sent dollars to them through the UN. Under the guise of humanitarian needs, $1.7 billion was provided to the UN, which used some of the money to buy dollars to fly into Afghanistan, to trade for Afghan currency, which the U.S. had also arranged to have printed on behalf of the Taliban. The exchange left the Taliban’s DAB terrorist bank with large amounts of U.S. currency that it could auction off to its own allies. The arrangement is even worse than it sounds because DAB artificially set the exchange rate of the Afghani to the dollar at a far higher rate than the black market exchange rate. And the Taliban bank used the auctions of the dollars to artificially prop up that exchange rate. USAID’s money laundering scheme not only used the UN to send a fortune in dollars to the Taliban, it allowed their terrorist bank to run a ‘dollar cartel’, buying dollars from the UN through its NGOs at favorable rates and then covertly reselling the dollars back in Pakistan to its ‘dollar cartel’ at much better rates as its rupee struggles against the dollar. During the intermediate step, DAB held ‘auctions’ of the dollars which elements linked to the Taliban, including the Haqqani network allied with Al Qaeda, reportedly ‘won’. The auctions prop up the Afghani currency and keep the Taliban in power. And the Taliban take their share at each step of the process, taxing all the various intermediaries before finally cashing out the money. Sending dollars to Afghanistan only to exchange them for Afghanis which the United States was also arranging for served absolutely no purpose except to give the Taliban liquid currency, but was justified as a way to prop up the Afghani currency as a 'humanitarian aid' measure. The money-laundering operation required multiple steps and plausible deniability for USAID, the State Department, and the UN which insisted that '[n]one of the cash brought into Afghanistan is deposited in the Central Bank of Afghanistan nor provided to the Taliban de facto authorities by the UN.' To the extent this was true, it was because the money was deposited in a 'private bank', allocated to NGOs funded by the UN which then exchanged it with DBA’s assets. USAID was able to claim plausible deniability because it was putting money into pooled UN accounts, which a report by the SIGAR Afghanistan War government watchdog revealed, 'prevents tying humanitarian assistance expenses—including for the purchase and transport of cash into Afghanistan—to a specific donor’s contribution. Putting the money into UN pooled accounts allowed USAID to claim that they 'do not provide assistance to or through the Taliban', they just put money into 'pooled UN accounts' which they do not control, and 'as a result, State and USAID do not know how much of their total contributions to the UN have been used to purchase cash for use in Afghanistan'. The UN deposits the dollars into its accounts in a conveniently unnamed ‘private bank’ in Afghanistan. Its name is surely known to the Taliban authorities, but continues to be unknown to United States officials. From there the money is distributed to the bank accounts of the NGOs funded by the UN. At that point they are most likely converted into Afghanis with DAB’s aid since the supply of the Taliban currency is controlled by Afghanistan’s central bank. That allows the UN to claim that '[n]one of the cash brought into Afghanistan is deposited in the Central Bank of Afghanistan nor provided to the Taliban de facto authorities by the UN.' The cash is not provided to the Taliban or DAB by the UN, but by the groups funded by the UN. The SIGAR report noted that 'a UN official told us that the UN’s liability ends when the recipient PIO and NGOs have the funds in their accounts.' The UN then disavows any liability for providing the money to the Taliban even as UN officials are well aware that it’s happening. The State Department responded to these revelations by falsely claiming that there are no sanctions on Afghanistan, that banks refuse to carry out wire transfers because of 'the lack of profitability' and that 'to the best of our knowledge, no electronic financial delivery systems are currently scalable to meet the liquidity needs of the UN' requiring it to instead convert billions of dollars into paper notes and ship them by plane. None of this is true or even a plausible lie. USAID declined to reply to the government watchdog’s report. The Taliban money laundering scheme was not an exception, it was how USAID, the State Department and the UN have operated for too long, not only in Afghanistan, but in Syria, Yemen, Gaza and many other terrorist areas around the world, using plausible deniability and chains of organizations to avoid accountability and direct responsibility for aiding terrorists. Americans have become the financiers of their worst enemies. It’s time for that to stop.

Report: Israel to settle for return of 3 hostages in exchange for...	Hamas reportedly willing to free 3 Israeli hostages on Saturday, a step Israel has said to have indicated would be enough to maintain the current ceasefire - despite Trump's ultimatum and mixed messages from Prime Minister Netanyahu. By World Israel News Staff The impending collapse of the Gaza ceasefire may have been averted this week, after Israel and Hamas both reportedly expressed a willingness to return to the original terms of the deal, after the Islamic terror group threatened on Monday to delay the return of three Israeli hostages, scheduled to be released on Saturday. On Wednesday, Israel's Walla outlet reported that Jerusalem has indicated to Hamas, via Egyptian and Qatari mediators, that Israel is willing to continue the Gaza ceasefire if Hamas releases three Israeli hostages on Saturday, as originally planned. Multiple Arabic media reports have stated that Hamas has also signalled its willingness to implement the latest hostage release on schedule. Citing an unnamed source, AFP reported that the Egyptian and Qatari interlocutors have secured Hamas' assurance that the Saturday hostage release of three captives will be carried out as planned. 'Hamas has confirmed to Egyptian officials its commitment… to conducting the sixth exchange of prisoners on time, on Saturday, as soon as Israel honors its commitment,' one source said. Another source told AFP that 'there is progress' towards resolving the crisis, adding that Israel has vowed to 'put in place a humanitarian protocol starting this morning.' 'Prefabricated units, tents, fuel, heavy equipment, medicine, materials for repairing hospitals and everything linked to the humanitarian protocol' will be brought into the Gaza Strip, the source continued. President Donald Trump threatened earlier this week that 'all hell' will break loose if Hamas does not return all the remaining hostages this Saturday by noon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened a full resumption of war if 'our hostages' were not returned by Saturday at noon, without specifying how many hostages would have to be released to keep the truce in place.

Trump talks with Putin about negotiating end to Ukraine war	Trump's call with Putin, the first-known conversation between the presidents since Trump's return to the White House, comes just ahead of the war's third anniversary. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he directed his national security team to 'start negotiations immediately' to end the war in Ukraine following a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful,' Trump posted on Truth Social. 'Millions of people have died in a War that would not have happened if I were President, but it did happen, so it must end. No more lives should be lost!' The Kremlin on Tuesday released American teacher Marc Fogel, who had been serving a 14-year sentence for possessing medical marijuana. Fogel's release 'serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,' Waltz said. Another American citizen was released Wednesday from a prison in Belarus, a close ally of Russia, according to State Department officials. Trump on the campaign trail pledged to end the war swiftly, criticizing then-president Joe Biden for failing to negotiate a resolution to a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. Trump's call with Putin, the first-known conversation between the presidents since Trump's return to the White House, comes just ahead of the war's third anniversary. Trump said he will call Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday 'to inform him of the conversation.' The president added that his discussion with Putin covered 'the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.' Zelensky met the same day with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Hamas forced hostage to stage her own death, smashed in captive’s...	Daniella Gilboa was forced to stage her own death for a propaganda film; a Thai hostage had his teeth smashed in. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The physical and mental torture that Hamas inflicted on the hostages included forcing one hostage to stage her own death and destroying the teeth of another. Daniella Gilboa had to lie still while covered with white powder and debris as a terrorist filmed her for a propaganda video that would falsely claim she was killed in an IDF airstrike in Gaza, her mother said Wednesday. Her captors came in with a camera and told her 'Today we are filming you dead,' which led her to believe that they were going to kill her, Orly Gilboa said. Terrified, she pleaded with them not to murder her. At the end, they used only a blurred picture of Gilboa’s supposed dead body to accompany a statement in November claiming that 'one of the enemy’s female prisoners was killed in an area that is under Zionist aggression in the northern Gaza Strip.' The picture immediately led to fears of her death because it showed a tattoo on the body just like one that Gilboa has. The fact that this preyed greatly on the young IDF observer’s mind could be surmised by the first thing she told her parents upon her release last month. 'When she saw me and my husband for the first time, she apologized for how she caused us to feel this whole time,' her mother said, even though the fault lay solely with Hamas. Last January, Hamas had forced Gilboa and two other hostages to speak on a video it released as a form of psychological warfare on Israel and the hostages' families. Channel 12 reported Wednesday that one of the five Thai workers that the terrorists released last week from Gaza had had his teeth smashed in by one of his captors, who slammed a rifle butt into his mouth. While he and his friends were beginning their recovery at the Shamir-Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, specialists in the oral and maxillofacial surgery department did extensive repair work on his mouth. Some of the freed Thai hostages also needed treatment for gunshot wounds, and all of them received initial psychological care as well. After spending ten days in the hospital, all five were flown back to their home country. Their physicians have prepared plans for follow-up care to be carried out in Thailand with Israeli funding. This includes continuing to pay for dental treatments for this man until his mouth and teeth are fully rehabilitated. The government has granted the Thais permanent residency rights in Israel in recognition of their horrific treatment at the hands of Israel’s enemies, and they will receive a monthly stipend of NIS9,000 shekels for the rest of their lives as victims of Arab terror. As freedom slowly reinvigorates the hostages Hamas has released in the last month, more stories of the terrorists’ cruelty appear almost every day.

Report: US okays ‘long-term’ IDF presence in Lebanon	Trump administration reportedly authorizes Israel to maintain a 'long-term' presence in key strategic areas in southern Lebanon, again pushing back the deadline for the full withdrawal of IDF forces. By World Israel News Staff The United States has granted Israel's request to maintain a military presence in parts of southern Lebanon beyond the current deadline for the IDF's withdrawal, according to a new report Wednesday night. Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, reported that the Trump administration has approved Jerusalem's request to a joint committee monitoring the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire for the IDF to maintain continued control of five strategically important positions in southern Lebanon near the Israeli border. According to the report, the U.S. has authorized Israel to keep a 'long-term' presence in the area, without specifying the duration of the IDF's stay. The report also claimed that the IDF has already begun building five army outposts to solidify its control over the positions in question, despite the U.S. previously rejecting Israel's request to modify the latest deadline for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. Even as the IDF is constructing the outposts, the report added, Israeli forces are pulling out of nearby Lebanese villages, in preparation for the return of nearly all of southern Lebanese territory by the February 18th deadline. Wednesday's report comes days after the Trump administration said that it expects Israel to adhere to the new deadline, which calls for the removal of all Israeli forces from Lebanon by February 18. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly spoke with President Donald Trump last week during his visit to Washington, urging the president to back Israel's request for an extension. The November deal originally imposed a 60-day deadline, requiring Israel to withdraw all of its forces from Lebanese territory by January 26th, in exchange for Hezbollah pulling its forces back to the northern bank of the Litani River, and the Lebanese military actively enforcing the ban on Hezbollah operations near the Israeli frontier. After Israel accused both Hezbollah and Beirut of living up to the agreement, however, the U.S. approved a delay in the implementation of the withdrawal, pushing the deadline back to February 18th.

Israel to strike Iran’s nuclear program in mid-2025, US predicts	American intelligence reportedly claims Jerusalem is poised to attack Iranian nuclear facilities in a preemptive strike sometime in the first half of 2025 - but believes attacks will only delay Iran's nuclear program by weeks or months. By World Israel News Staff Israel is planning to carry out a series of preemptive airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities in the coming months, American intelligence officials predict. According to a report published by The Washington Post early Thursday morning, a dossier produced by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense Intelligence Agency last month claims that Israel will likely carry out strikes on several Iranian nuclear facilities sometime during the first half of 2025. Specifically, the report claimed that the Israeli Air Force will probably strike at the nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz. Thursday's report, which cited American officials and former U.S. officials, said that the January dossier was based in part on an analysis of Israel's strikes on Iran's air defense network in October, following Iran's second major ballistic missile strike on the Jewish state. Israel and various American intel agencies, including the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Director of National Intelligence's office all declined to comment on the report. White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in response that the Trump administration 'will not permit Iran to get a nuclear weapon.' President Trump, Hughes continued, has said that 'while he prefers negotiating a resolution to American’s long-standing issues with the Iranian regime peacefully, he will not wait indefinitely if Iran isn’t willing to deal, and soon.' The January dossier laid out two possible scenarios, both of which could see the U.S. indirectly support Israeli airstrikes on Iran with either airborne refueling of Israeli warplanes, reconnaissance, or intelligence. The first scenario revolves around the use of long-range standoff weapons, likely aerial-launched ballistic missiles fired from Israeli fighter jets operating outside of Iranian airspace. The second and riskier option would involve Israeli warplanes penetrating deep into Iran's airspace to drop BLU-109 bunker buster bombs. Depending in part on the form Israel's airstrikes take and the degree to which they succeed, preemptive strikes would push back Iran's nuclear program by a matter of weeks or months, the U.S. intel dossier said. However, one former American official told the Post that Israel's assessment of the impact of potential airstrikes differs significantly with that of the U.S. intel community, with Israeli officials arguing that strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities could inflict catastrophic damage on Tehran's nuclear program. 'That was a difference between our intelligence and their assessment,' the official said.

Terror accomplice drove van with hostage-supporting symbol	Driver of van affixed sticker of yellow hostage ribbon to his vehicle, in order to stave off suspicion as he illegally transported Palestinians into Israel. By World Israel News Staff A suspect charged with transporting a terrorist had placed a sticker expressing solidarity with the hostages in Gaza on his vehicle, according to an indictment. Prosecutors published on Thursday excerpts from the indictment against Majed Barkan, a 20-year-old resident of eastern Jerusalem. Barkan transported Salah Yahya, a 19-year-old terrorist from Tulkarem who had infiltrated into Israel illegally, to Tel Aviv in January 2025. Barkan picked up Yahya from the Atarot industrial zone in Jerusalem, an area where residents of PA-controlled enclaves in Judea and Samaria often seek transportation into pre-1967 Israel. Once in Tel Aviv, Yahya carried out a frenzied stabbing attack in the city, severely wounding a man. He was then shot dead by an armed bystander. The authorities are charging that Barkan was aware Yahya 'was illegally present in Israel, and could endanger the security of Israeli citizens and even carry out an attack.' Images of Barkan's van included the indictment showed that he had placed a large yellow ribbon on the vehicle. The yellow ribbon is used in Israel to express support for the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and their families. It's likely that Barkan used the symbol in order to stave off potential suspicion of his vehicle, as he often transported Palestinians without legal permission to be in Israel. 'We take very seriously any involvement of Israeli citizens in transporting, employing, or harboring illegal residents, especially when it leads to terrorist attacks,' the Israel Police said in a statement. 'There will be zero tolerance for those who assist terrorists in their murderous activities, and we will take firm action against anyone who endangers public safety. We will continue to use all means at our disposal to arrest them and bring them to justice.'

Iran flying cash to Hezbollah via Beirut Airport – IDF warning	IDF spokesman said that Iran has successfully smuggled money, intended for re-arming Hezbollah, through the airport. By World Israel News Staff Iran is trying to rebuild its battered proxy group Hezbollah by flying millions of dollars to the terror organization through Beirut International Airport, a practice which the IDF has warned must stop immediately. In an unusual statement, the IDF's Arabic language spokesman Avichai Adaree wrote on X that the Israeli military will take steps to prevent the transfers from continuing. 'Iran's Quds Force and the terrorist organization Hezbollah have been exploiting Beirut International Airport through civilian flights in an attempt to smuggle funds intended for Hezbollah's armament, aiming to carry out attacks against the State of Israel,' Adaree wrote. 'The IDF remains in continuous communication with the monitors who are enforcing the ceasefire and regularly shares specific information to thwart these smuggling operations,' he continued. 'Despite ongoing efforts, our assessments indicate that some of these smuggling attempts have been successful.' Adaree stressed that the 'IDF will not allow Hezbollah to arm itself and will use all available means to enforce the ceasefire agreements and ensure the security of Israeli citizens.' The statement comes just days ahead of the the deadline for Israel to withdraw troops from southern Lebanon. A Trump administration official recently confirmed that Washington expects the IDF to leave the region by February 18th. However, reports have indicated that Israel is lobbying to extend that deadline. Displaced residents of northern Israel's border region, who were evacuated from their homes shortly after the October 7th, 2023 terror onslaught, have still been unable to return to their communities. The Israeli government set March 1st as the date for which displaced northerners are expected to return home, but that timeframe appears unlikely. Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avichai Stern recently posted a video showing several concrete slabs haphazardly placed at the border, ostensibly as a barrier against a Hezbollah invasion. Noting the fact that the barrier could be easily overcome, Stern said it 'really looks like we’ve learned nothing from October 7th.'

Organization warns Israelis against participating in anti-settler...	Theroux: 'I’m interested in ideologues and fundamentalists of all stripes &#8230;I wanted to see settler expansionism up close, and the human cost it entails.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Israeli Sovereignty Movement warned Israelis not to participate in or speak with Louis Theroux for his upcoming documentary, which is likely to put settlers in a negative light. Documentary film presenter Louis Theroux will return to Judea and Samaria for a show on the BBC called The Settlers. Fifteen years ago, Theroux made a documentary called The Ultra-Zionists, whose purpose was to look at the 'extreme end of the Israeli settler community in the West Bank.' According to Theroux, the purpose of returning is to observe settlers in the context of the Israel-Hamas war. 'Since then, those same extreme settlers are even more emboldened,' Theroux said, likely referring to the BBC statement that Theroux will reveal some settlers 'are already making plans to move into' the Gaza Strip. Working with the assumption that settlers are inherently extremists, Theroux said, 'I’m interested in ideologues and fundamentalists of all stripes. In going back to the West Bank, I wanted to see settler expansionism up close, and the human cost it entails.' 'It’s a story specific to a time, a place, and a region, but it’s also a universal insight into tribalism and the ways in which we can blind ourselves to the humanity of those around us.' The Israeli Sovereignty Movement, headed by Yehudit Katsover and Nadia Matar, is warning Israelis not to engage with or talk to Louis Theroux and his team because of the negative way Theroux has depicted settlers in the past. In a post, the organization called Theroux 'A very anti-Israel person' and 'very smart and experienced,' who travels the world and exposes anyone the left-wing labels as 'extreme.' They described Theroux's 2010 documentary as 'very, very negative.' In the warning, the organization characterizes Theroux as someone who presents himself as 'naive and even a bit stupid' and as someone who 'just wants to understand another perspective' to create a 'trap' in order to get 'the most extreme, stupid, or weird responses, or anything that can be edited that way.' The Israeli Sovereignty Movement warned Israelis not to speak to Theroux or any of his team, including Director Josh Baker, Senior Producer, Sara Obeidat, Producer Matan Cohen, and Production Manager Emily Wallace.

2024 deadliest year for journalists; media claims most killed by ...	In October, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that six Al Jazeera journalists were members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that more journalists were killed in 2024 than in any previous year since it began keeping records. The organization attributed most of these deaths to Israel's military. According to CPJ statistics, 124 journalists and media workers were killed while on the job, with 70% of the deaths linked to Israeli military actions. The year 2024 surpassed the previous record of 113 journalist deaths in 2007, when half of the fatalities resulted from coverage of the Iraq War. Outside of Gaza and Lebanon, journalists were also killed in Sudan (6), Pakistan (6), Mexico (5), Syria (4), Myanmar (3), Iraq (3), and Haiti (2). CPJ stated that these journalists were killed in connection with their work and asserted that 24 of them were deliberately targeted in 2024. The organization cited Al Jazeera, which claimed that the killing of journalists was part of a systematic campaign targeting the network’s reporters and their families. However, there have been multiple instances where journalists were found to be working alongside terrorists or were suspected of having direct ties to militant organizations. In June, the IDF released a statement asserting that freed hostages Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv had been held by journalist Abdallah Aljamal and his family at their home in a central Gaza camp. According to Euro-Med, Aljamal resided on the first floor of a multi-story building, while the IDF reported that the hostages were found on the third floor. In October, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that six Al Jazeera journalists were members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad—both designated as terrorist organizations—citing documents uncovered in Gaza. The IDF stated on X (formerly Twitter) that it had obtained documents and intelligence information revealing that the six journalists—Anas Jamal Mahmoud Al-Sharif, Alaa Abdul Aziz Muhammad Salama, Hossam Basel Abdul Karim Shabat, Ashraf Sami Ashour Saraj, Ismail Farid Muhammad Abu Omar, and Talal Mahmoud Abdul Rahman Aruki—were affiliated with Palestinian terrorist groups. The IDF argued that these revelations cast doubt on the credibility and impartiality of Al Jazeera’s reporting in Gaza. Additionally, according to Honest Reporting, journalists working for Reuters, AP, and other media outlets were present with Hamas terrorists during the October 7th massacres and encouraged others to take part. One such journalist, Ashraf Amra, who had been working for Reuters and AP, was recorded viewing and appearing to enjoy another photojournalist’s footage of an IDF soldier being lynched. In the footage, two journalists recall how they infiltrated Israel’s border and laugh as they describe how the soldier’s body was mutilated and brutalized even after his death.

Family of kidnapped IDF soldier Matan Angrest receives news he is...	Matan Angrest's mother Anat: 'We were informed that he was held there in harsh conditions because he is a soldier.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The family of captive IDF soldier Matan Angrest received news from released hostages that he is alive but being held in extremely harsh conditions. Matan's mother, Anat, told Channel 12 News, 'We were informed that he was held there in harsh conditions because he is a soldier.' Matan served in a tank unit and was captured by Hamas while fighting on October 7. The other IDF troops in his tank—Itai Chen, Daniel Peretz, and Tomer Leibovitz—were killed, and their bodies were taken to Gaza. At the time of his capture, Angrest suffered critical injuries, which have likely remained untreated during his captivity. Matan's father, Hagi, said, 'We received a sign of life from the returnees about our beloved son, Matan, which deeply moved us. It is time to bring him home as soon as possible, along with all the others. Return our Matan to us, along with the other hostages, without delay. Their conditions are difficult, and the time to bring them back is now.' Hagi added that his family was 'shocked' to see the emaciated condition of the hostages released last Saturday, saying the images reminded him of his grandmother, who survived Auschwitz. 'These pictures are the same as the pictures of my grandmother who was released from Auschwitz,' he said. He added, 'Hamas is responsible for this crime against humanity, but Prime Minister Netanyahu and the government are responsible for ending this hell—this Holocaust.' He urged Netanyahu to proceed with the second phase of the hostage deal. In July, the IDF discovered a recording of Angrest in Gaza and gave it to his parents. There are indications that Angrest’s remarks were scripted by Hamas terrorists. For instance, instead of using the word 'hostage,' he referred to himself as a 'prisoner.' In the recording, Angrest directly appeals to Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire deal to secure the release of the hostages. 'Netanyahu,' he says in the clip, 'you must, must do this exchange between the [Palestinian] prisoners in Israel and the prisoners here. I very much want to see my family and friends—it's very important.'

Houthi leader warns will attack again if Gaza truce breaks	The terrorist leader claimed that the U.S.-Israeli agenda aimed to seize Islamic holy sites, including Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. By JNS The Houthis in Yemen have threatened to renew attacks on Israel if the Gaza ceasefire collapses. Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Iranian-backed terror group, declared in a televised address on Tuesday that its forces are 'ready to respond immediately' if Israeli attacks on Gaza resume. He emphasized the importance of Arab and Islamic unity against U.S. policies and condemned any efforts to resettle Gazans, specifically criticizing President Donald Trump’s plans regarding the future of the war-torn coastal enclave.

The terrorist leader claimed that the U.S.-Israeli agenda aimed to seize Islamic holy sites, including Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. Trump has re-designated the rebel group that controls northern Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization. Following the Hamas-led massacre in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the group, which calls itself Ansar Allah, began firing hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel and at commercial ships in the Red Sea. The Israel Defense Forces is increasing troop reinforcements and mobilizing reservists in the Southern Command following Hamas’s announcement that it would delay releasing hostages. Unless Hamas returns Israeli hostages by noon on Saturday, Feb. 15, the ceasefire will expire and the IDF will resume fighting until it defeats the terrorist group totally, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. The statement by Netanyahu announcing the ultimatum followed remarks on Monday by Trump, who also named Feb. 15 at noon as the deadline after which 'all hell will break loose' unless Hamas frees all hostages.

He will also meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who will be key to President Donald Trump’s professed goal of ending the Russia-Ukraine war. By Ben Sales, JTA Vice President J.D. Vance will visit the site of the Dachau concentration camp on Thursday, the latest in a string of senior U.S. officials to travel to the former Nazi camp. Vance will visit Dachau before heading to the nearby Munich Security Conference, an elite national security gathering, multiple outlets reported on Tuesday. He wrote on social media that his visit to Europe is focusing on artificial intelligence policy. He will also meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who will be key to President Donald Trump’s professed goal of ending the Russia-Ukraine war. Vance is the latest vice president to visit Dachau, one of the first camps built by the Nazi regime. Joe Biden visited with his granddaughter in 2015, when he was serving as vice president, and has taken the trip with other children and grandchildren as well. Vice President Mike Pence visited Dachau in 2017. In 2023, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, went on a Jewish heritage tour of Poland, including a visit to Auschwitz.

Israel pushes to keep IDF in parts of southern Lebanon past US de...	Israel's military has reportedly submitted plans for its forces to remain in strategically important areas in southern Lebanon beyond the deadline set by the US. By World Israel News Staff Israel is requesting an additional extension on the deadline for the removal of its armed forces from southern Lebanon, two sources told Reuters on Wednesday. The Reuters report cited a Lebanese official and a foreign diplomat, both of whom said that the Israeli military has filed a request with the multinational committee appointed to oversee the ceasefire between Israel and the Hezbollah terrorist group in a bid to push back the deadline for completing the withdrawal of the IDF from southern Lebanon. According to the report Israel has requested it be allowed to maintain control over five strategically important positions in southern Lebanon until the end of the month. Under the ceasefire deal, which went into effect in late November after efforts by the Biden administration and Macron government to secure Israel's agreement, the IDF was to have withdrawn all of its forces from Lebanese territory by January 26th. However, citing Hezbollah violations of the ceasefire, and the failure of the Lebanese military to assume full control over the territory being vacated by Israeli forces, the Trump administration backed Israel's requests to extend the IDF's presence in Lebanon. On Monday, however, the Trump administration said that it expects Israel to adhere to the new deadline, which calls for the removal of all Israeli forces from Lebanon by February 18th. Israel's Channel 12 reported Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited the White House earlier this week, has asked President Donald Trump to back Israel's request to maintain control over critical positions in southern Lebanon beyond the February 18th deadline. Netanyahu was quoted as telling the president that Lebanon's military has thus far been unable to prevent Hezbollah from reestablishing control over southern Lebanon.

Under Biden, American universities raked in nearly $1 billion fro...	While universities are required to disclose those foreign donors to the federal government under Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the Biden administration broke the precedent with prior administrations by withholding the names of foreign donors to the public. By Alana Goodman, The Washington Free Beacon American universities raked in nearly a billion dollars in the past four years from mystery donors in offshore tax havens, according to records reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. While the universities listed the unnamed donations as coming from places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, the Free Beacon traced millions of dollars back to donors linked to China. The news comes as the Trump administration prepares to crack down on foreign influence on college campuses, following years of Biden administration policies that have shielded the names of foreign university donors from the public. Since 2021, U.S. universities reported receiving over $600 million from donors in Bermuda, $280 million from Guernsey, $25 million from the British Virgin Islands, $25 million from the Bahamas, $17.5 million from Cayman Islands, and $11 million from the island of Jersey, Department of Education records show. While universities are required to disclose those foreign donors to the federal government under Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the Biden administration broke precedent with prior administrations by withholding the names of foreign donors to the public. As a result, for the past four years, the Department of Education only released the names of the countries where each donation came from. Tax haven countries represented some of the largest sources of funding during that time, raising questions about transparency and where the actual money is coming from. In some cases, records reviewed by the Free Beacon show, it's coming from China. The University of Pennsylvania, for example, reported in June 2022 that it received $3 million from a donor in the Cayman Islands to support the 'Penn Wharton China center including research articles and case studies,' according to federal records. But state records from Pennsylvania—where schools are required to report the names of foreign donors—list the donor as E-House Enterprise Holdings, a Chinese real estate company with a listed address in Hong Kong. The company is led by Xin Zhou, a Chinese national who serves on Penn's Wharton Board of Advisors. State records also show that Penn received $1 million in 2023 from Qihui Holdings, a shareholder of Chinese shopping platform Meituan Dianping. Penn's federal disclosure lists the money as coming from a donor in the British Virgin Islands to support the 'Artificial Intelligence Program at the Wharton School.' Meituan Dianping's cofounder and former CEO, Tao Zhang, is a Chinese national who attended the Wharton School. Both Zhou and Zhang's past contributions to Penn have come under scrutiny. In 2020, the Free Beacon reported that a $3 million donation the school claimed was from Zhou actually came from a Hong Kong company owned by a Shanghai businessman with deep ties to Chinese government officials. Penn also sparked controversy for taking money from Zhang in 2022 after Fox News reported on his company’s involvement in party-building activities for the Chinese Communist Party and CCP-connected shareholders, including Tencent and Alibaba. The Pennsylvania records were obtained by watchdog group Americans for Public Trust and shared with the Free Beacon. The group's director, Caitlin Sutherland, called for a federal foreign funding reporting system that includes donors' names. 'The current system allows the individual sources of the foreign money to remain obscured from the public, which raises serious concerns when the donors hail from adversarial countries like China and Qatar,' said Sutherland. 'The American public deserves to know exactly who is buying influence in our higher education system.' In addition to Penn, state records show that Carnegie Mellon University received $100,000 through the Cayman Islands from the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute in August 2022. The donation does not appear to be listed in federal foreign donor records. Tianqiao Chen, a billionaire and reported member of the Chinese Communist Party, sparked outcry from Republican lawmakers last year after reporting revealed him to be the second-largest foreign farmland owner in the United States. Other university disclosures also raise questions about the true sources of donations from known tax havens. In 2023, Yale reported receiving a $79 million donation from the island of Guernsey to fund an 'institute to enhance the understanding of human cognition.' Yale’s Wu Tsai Institute, which focuses on the study of human cognition, is bankrolled by Joseph Tsai, the chairman of China’s Alibaba Group. Alibaba has extensive ties to the Chinese government, which owns stakes in a number of its business units. Although state records aren’t available to confirm that Tsai is the donor—Connecticut does not publish such records—the Joe and Clara Tsai Foundation is based in the island of Guernsey, according to corporate disclosures. Yale has reported receiving over $400 million from Guernsey since 2020. Yale faced an investigation under the first Trump administration in connection with donations from Tsai. The Department of Education accused the school of failing to disclose hundreds of millions in foreign grants, including $30 million from Tsai. Tsai is also a major donor to the China Center at the University of San Diego, a school that reported receiving $14 million from the island of Guernsey in 2022 and 2023. Penn, Carnegie Mellon, and Yale did not respond to requests for comment. Earlier this month, the American Enterprise Institute published a report noting that American universities have 'failed to report billions in foreign funding, which drove the first Trump administration to launch several investigations into Section 117 noncompliance.' The report noted that schools under investigation reported receiving nearly $900 million in funding from China. Mark Schneider, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told the Free Beacon that the Biden administration 'did almost nothing' to investigate whether schools were complying with the disclosure requirements. He expects this to change quickly under the Trump administration. Schneider said donors could use tax haven countries as a way of 'hiding the ultimate source of the money.' 'There’s a lot of suspicion of elite institutions,' said Schneider. 'They’re going to be under a lot of pressure and [face] a lot of investigations into their practices.'

US-funded condoms not sent to Gaza Strip, Musk admits	Trump's efficiency czar walks back claims that USAID was spending tens of millions of dollars on condoms for the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, after Gaza Province confused with Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Claims by the Trump administration that the United States federal government sent tens of millions of dollars-worth of condoms to the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip were incorrect, Elon Musk acknowledged during a press briefing Tuesday. On Tuesday, Musk, the billionaire tech mogul tapped by President Donald Trump to head the new Department of Government Efficiency, held an impromptu press briefing with reporters in the Oval Office Tuesday, defending his agency's work. When questioned over DOGE's claim last month that the USAID agency had spent $50 million dollars on condoms for the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip - despite push-back from reporters who said they found no evidence of any such transfer - Musk acknowledged that the initial claim was the result of a mistake. While USAID had in fact funded a program providing condoms to Gaza - to the tune of $50 million - the Gaza in question was not the Gaza Strip, but a province named Gaza in the African nation of Mozambique. 'We are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we'll also fix the mistakes very quickly,' Musk said, downplaying the issue. The DOGE administrator added that he is still critical of U.S. funding for the program. 'I'm not sure we should be sending $50 million worth of condoms anywhere, frankly.' 'If the condoms went to Mozambique instead of Gaza, then fine, it's not so bad, but still, why are we doing this? I'm not sure that's something the American people would be happy about. That's an enormous number of condoms.' After DOGE made its initial claim that USAID was funding the shipment of condoms to the Gaza Strip, President Trump claimed Hamas had 'turned [the] condoms into bombs,' citing the past use by Gaza terrorists of makeshift balloons for incendiary bombs against Israel.

Trump secures American’s release from Russian prison after Biden’...	Though Fogel began serving his sentence in June 2022, the Biden administration did not designate him as 'wrongfully detained' until late last year. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon President Donald Trump on Tuesday secured the release of an American teacher imprisoned in Russia since 2021, striking an exchange deal with the Kremlin after the Biden administration repeatedly failed to bring the man home. Marc Fogel, 63, was arrested at a Russian airport in August 2021 for possessing medical marijuana and sentenced to 14 years in prison. The history teacher from Pennsylvania is now 'leaving Russian airspace' and expected to be back on U.S. soil by Tuesday evening, according to White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Waltz said in a statement that Trump, along with Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and other advisers, 'negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine.' He did not say whether the United States released a prisoner in return. Former president Joe Biden's administration long claimed it was working to secure Fogel's release but failed to make progress, even as it struck deals to free other Americans held by Russia. Though Fogel began serving his sentence in June 2022, the Biden administration did not designate him as 'wrongfully detained' until late last year, despite multiple calls from lawmakers and Fogel's family. Fogel's lawyers and family had harsh words for Biden's handling of the case, with attorneys Martin De Luca and Andrew Smith thanking Trump and blasting the Biden team for 'bureaucratic inaction,' the New York Times reported. Fogel's mother told CBS News last year that 'I don't think the [Biden] administration has helped us one bit.' The Biden administration left Fogel out of a high-profile prisoner swap last summer. The deal, the largest swap since the Cold War, secured the release of 26 individuals, including 3 Americans. FREED PRISONER MARC FOGEL: 'PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A HERO!'

Hamas-linked lobbying network expands political influence in Euro...	LP4Q describes itself as an organization established 'at the initiative of parliamentarians who support Palestinian rights.' By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner A Turkey-based lobbying network with ties to the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas is working to recruit European politicians to support anti-Israel policies, according to a new investigative report. NGO Monitor, a Jerusalem-based research institute that tracks anti-Israel bias among nongovernmental organizations, published a report last week on the expansion of the League of Parliamentarians for Al-Quds and Palestine (LP4Q). This political lobby network, which was established in 2015 and includes about 1,500 parliamentarians from around the world, is growing its influence across several European countries. Vincent Chebat, senior researcher at NGO Monitor, authored the report, which exposes the dysfunction in the ways interest groups operate within European parliaments. He noted that the information about LP4Q’s connections to Hamas and the involvement of highly controversial European representatives in a lobby group backed by Turkey and Qatar was easily accessible. 'The lack of basic vetting is remarkable,' he told The Algemeiner. 'It is not surprising that far-left MPs, some belonging to parties that have repeatedly refused to recognize Hamas as a terrorist entity, were involved in establishing this network.' Since 2023, LP4Q members have met with current and former members of parliaments across Europe and activists in the European Parliament, Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, the UK, Ireland, Scotland, and Finland. The organization is also 'preparing to expand' its activities to Portugal, the Netherlands, and Eastern Europe. LP4Q describes itself as an organization established 'at the initiative of parliamentarians who support Palestinian rights.' Last year, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an outspoken supporter of Hamas and a fierce critic of Israel, said that 'the League of Parliamentarians for al-Quds has become the voice of the Palestinian issue at the global level.' Michele Piras, a former Italian member of parliament and current LP4Q board member, leads the group’s expansion in Europe and has reportedly engaged with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), an internationally designated terrorist organization that participated in Hamas’s invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, according to NGO Monitor. Last year, LP4Q’s European Network held its first meeting at the French National Assembly, bringing together 20 parliamentarians from several European countries to discuss, as they described, 'the pressing need for Europe to take decisive action to halt the ongoing genocide in Gaza.' The New Executive Board of the League of Parliamentarians for al-Quds and Palestine Holds its First Meeting (May 2024). Photo: NGO Monitor 'Participants advocated for measures such as the cessation of military cooperation with Israel, an arms embargo, an immediate ceasefire, and the provision of humanitarian aid to civilians,' LP4Q wrote in a statement. 'Additionally, support was voiced for pursuing legal avenues, including actions before the International Court of Justice, to ensure severe condemnation of Israeli crimes,' the statement continued. During the meeting, members also argued for 'the recognition of an independent Palestinian State … and the right to self-determination for the Palestinian people.' NGO Monitor reported that 160 current and former European parliamentarians signed a petition outlining their positions on the French communist website L’Humanité as part of the European Network’s launch. The signatories included 99 French, 23 Italian, 12 Belgian, and 14 Spanish MPs, senators, and MEPs (member of European Parliament). Until its expansion to Europe, LP4Q was originally composed of members of parliament from Muslim countries, with at least two of its board members linked to Hamas and having been sanctioned by the US government. For example, LP4Q President Hamid bin Abdullah Al-Ahmar, a Yemeni businessman, is considered one of Hamas’s most prominent international supporters, according to the US Treasury Department. He also played a key role in Hamas’s investment portfolio, which managed over $500 million worth of assets at its peak. In 2021, Al-Ahmar met now-deceased Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh to discuss 'the political developments related to the Palestinian issue, the dangers facing it, ways to confront them, and the required national, regional, and international work strategies, especially within the parliamentary framework represented by the Parliamentarians for Jerusalem Association.' Other LP4Q members and officials also have ties to Hamas. For example, board member Sayed Salem Abu-Msameh has been described as 'one of the founders of Hamas' and was reportedly sentenced by Israel to 12 years in prison for helping to establish the terrorist group’s military wing. LP4Q board vice presidents Hasan Turan, a Turkish member of parliament, and Ahmed Kharchi, an Algerian member of parliament, have also been linked to Hamas, with Turan reportedly facilitating high-level meetings between senior Hamas leaders and Turkish political elites. According to NGO Monitor, LP4Q already has influence in Muslim states, including Qatar, as well as in Africa and South America, through its observer membership in the Parliamentary Union of the OIC Member States (PUIC), the African Parliamentary Union (APU), the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption (GOPAC), and the Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union. As for LP4Q’s finances, NGO Monitor explained that the Turkey-based lobbying network is not transparent about its sources of funding, and the amounts related to its agreements remain undisclosed. In 2021, LP4Q signed a 'protocol cooperation' with a Turkish governmental institution, the Presidency for Turks Abroad and Related Communities. That same year, it agreed with the state-run news agency Anadolu 'to engage and coordinate in order to serve the Palestinian and the cause of Jerusalem in the media and to confront the disinformation and falsification campaigns of the Israeli media machine.' The Algemeiner reached out to LP4Q for comment for this story but did not receive a response.

Jared Kushner behind Gaza resettlement plan – report	The president’s son-in-law floated the idea of moving Gazans out in order to rebuild the coastal enclave a year ago. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Jared Kushner is reportedly the man behind the idea floated by President Donald Trump last week after meeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of rebuilding Gaza while moving its current residents to a safer and better life in other countries. Citing an anonymous source, subscription platform Puck News reported at the time that the president’s son-in-law and one of the architects of the Abraham Accords had helped prepare the statements Trump made at the subsequent press conference. His remarks included calling for permanently resettling Palestinians outside Gaza, saying that 'the U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip,' and that he sees it as 'a long-term ownership position' which he claimed would bring 'great stability' to the region. It could also turn Gaza one day into 'the Riviera of the Middle East,' he said, speaking as the billionaire real estate expert he is. While not providing a timeline as to what had occurred first, Axios reported Monday that Netanyahu had 'met last week' with Kushner in Washington and they talked about the president’s plan for Gaza Kushner is receiving credit now because although Trump’s idea caught almost everyone by surprise, he had already mentioned at least part of it a year ago. When speaking at a 'Middle East Initiative' forum at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government only four months into the Israel-Hamas war, Kushner said that he didn’t think there was much point for Palestinians to remain as he 'wasn’t sure there is much left of Gaza at this point.' 'From Israel’s perspective, I would do my best to move the people out and then clean it up,' he said, adding quickly that he didn’t think that Israel would want to remove the population permanently. The former real estate developer also said that 'Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable if people would focus on building up livelihoods.' Trump also questioned why anyone would want to stay in a place full of rubble and 'unexploded bombs.' He has also since doubled down on the idea that the Gazans should not necessarily have the right to return, although he has also said their new homes and lives would be so nice they would not want to come back. Kushner’s interlocutor at the forum, Prof. Tarek Masoud of the Kennedy School, clarified to CBS News after Tuesday’s bombshell that his guest had been speaking specifically about the Arabs in Rafah before the anti-Hamas IDF operation began in the southern town. Egypt had turned down the idea of letting Gazans into the Sinai to protect them from the upcoming battle, he said, and 'Kushner was proposing another option, which was to create a safe zone in the Negev desert, which is part of Israel, and he ended that discussion by saying that nobody was saying that the people of Gaza would not go back.' Netanyahu has praised Trump’s plan for Gaza, and his 'willingness to think outside the box' and 'puncture conventional thinking,' which he pointed out has not helped solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict even after decades of trying.

IDF ready to rapidly re-enter Gaza if ordered	The IDF continues to maintain a presence in southern Gaza’s Philadelphi Corridor on the border with Egypt, and it surrounds the Rafah Crossing. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS The Israel Defense Forces stands ready to redeploy throughout the Gaza Strip should the Cabinet give the order, according to military sources, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set an ultimatum for Hamas to release hostages by noon on Saturday. The timeline for such a redeployment would be very rapid, according to the sources, and the IDF’s presence in Gaza can be re-established in very little time, similar to the speed with which the Israeli military withdrew, military sources told JNS on Tuesday. The Netzarim Corridor On Monday, Army Radio reported that the IDF is preparing to return an additional division to the Gaza Strip, with the headquarters of the reservist 252nd Division re-mobilized to Gaza City. This division left the Netzarim Corridor that separates northern Gaza from the rest of the Strip in December. According to the report, IDF Southern Command has approving plans and battle procedures for possible return to combat. All leaves have been canceled for forces in the sector until further notice. The IDF also indicated that civilian safety guidelines in the border areas remain unchanged, though the situation is being reassessed. Currently, the IDF’s 162nd Division is holding the northern area of the buffer zone separating northern Gaza and Israel, and protecting the border communities in the western Negev. The Gaza Division remains in the southern part of the buffer zone, protecting the southern border communities. Col. (res.) Dr. Eran Lerman, vice president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies and former deputy director of the Israeli National Security Council, told JNS on Monday, 'The capabilities of Hamas to rebuild its civilian rule throughout the Strip have already materialized, because Israel did nothing to replace it in the last year.' On the other hand, he assessed, as long as Egypt does not turn into an overt enemy, Hamas 'will not significantly rebuild its military power, and it will be possible [for the IDF] to maneuver quickly and with full force based on everything learned this year.' On Monday, the IDF completed its withdrawal from the strategic Netzarim Corridor, as part of the first stage of the ceasefire and hostage release agreement with Hamas. The corridor became one of the symbols of Israeli military control by creating a buffer that split the Strip between its northern and southern parts, preventing free movement between them. In October 2024, when the IDF re-entered northern Gaza after an eight-month absence, it used checkpoints to screen civilians moving south and arrested more than a thousand terrorists. Since then, tens of thousands of Gazans returned to northern Gaza after the corridor was vacated, and it is likely that many terrorists returned with them. While vehicle traffic moving north in Gaza must pass through checkpoints staffed by a private U.S. security contractor, pedestrian traffic is unscreened. On Feb. 10, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit issued a statement through its Arabic-language spokesperson, Col. Avichay Adraee, announcing that the return of Gazan residents on foot to the northern Strip via Salah al-Din Street will be permitted. 'As for the movement of vehicles to the north of the Strip, it will continue subject to inspection via the Salah al-Din axis. We note that the movement of terrorists or the transfer of combat equipment through these corridors to the northern Gaza Strip is strictly prohibited and will be considered a breach of the agreement. We call on you to refrain from cooperating with any terrorist group seeking to exploit you in order to transfer combat equipment or prohibited materials.' The IDF continues to maintain a presence in southern Gaza’s Philadelphi Corridor on the border with Egypt, and surrounds the Rafah Crossing. In recent days, the IDF opened fire repeatedly throughout Gaza to warn suspects approaching Israeli forces or violating the restricted buffer zone, which runs deep into Gaza and runs along the entire Israel border. On Sunday, Palestinian sources said three people were killed by IDF fire after entering the buffer zone near Kibbutz Nahal Oz. IDF said that day the it operated to distance suspects who posed a threat to troops. The military added that it is 'prepared for any scenario and will continue to thwart any immediate threat.'

Rubio: ‘Don’t believe anything Hamas says’	It's not a stupid ceasefire,' says US Secretary of State, emphasizing Israel must not allow Hamas to rebuild itself during the Gaza truce, as Netanyahu warns of return to war if hostages not released on Saturday. By World Israel News Staff U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to back Israel's plans to resume the war in the Gaza Strip if the Hamas terror organization fails to release Israeli hostages this coming Saturday. During an interview Tuesday with NewsNation, Rubio said in response to Hamas claims Monday that Israel has abrogated the Gaza ceasefire by limiting aid into the Strip that 'you can't believe anything Hamas says.' Rubio reiterated President Donald Trump's demand that all of the remaining Israeli hostages be released on Saturday, and not merely the three slated for release as part of the pre-existing schedule. 'I think the President’s been very clear he wants to see those hostages come – be released. He’s tired of this drip, drip every week. There’s some Americans there as well. He wants to see them released, and he’s made very clear that if that’s not the case on Saturday, then then all bets are off. And it’s not going to be good for Hamas. But let’s hope that that resolves itself. ' Nevertheless, Rubio expressed hope the ceasefire remains in place, while acknowledging that it remains 'tenuous,' after Hamas announced it will delay the release of additional hostages. 'It’s always a tenuous ceasefire, because you’re dealing with a terrorist organization in Hamas,' Rubio continued. 'I don’t think anyone wants to see a resumption of hostilities. But by the same token, we can’t have Hamas deciding what parts of the deal they’re going to live up to and what parts they’re not.' The Secretary of State seemed to signal support for continued Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip should the ceasefire fail. 'Part of the challenge here is that Hamas&#8230; continues to use networks to smuggle in weaponry and aid for themselves to reconstitute themselves. Israel can’t allow that to happen.' 'You can’t allow them, Hamas, to use the ceasefire to sort of rebuild itself and recover strength. So it’s a ceasefire but it’s not a stupid ceasefire.'

‘West Bank annexation will work out very well,’ says Trump	President Trump refuses to guarantee Israel won't apply sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, says 'annexation will work out automatically.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump refused Tuesday to guarantee the U.S. would not back Israel's application of sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, saying during a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II that annexation would 'work out very well.' On Tuesday, the president hosted King Abdullah at the White House for their first meeting since Trump returned to office last month. Before the two spoke behind closed doors, Trump addressed questions posed by reporters, including one who asked whether the U.S. would guarantee that it will not permit Israel to extend sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. Trump, sitting next to King Abdullah, refused to offer any such guarantee, and instead appeared to indicate support for such a move by Israel. 'Many people in the region, especially in Jordan, are worried about the annexation of the West Bank,' the reporter said. 'Will you give His Majesty the King a guarantee that you won't allow Israel to annex the West Bank?' the reporter continued. While declining to delve into the subject, Trump offered no promise to oppose Israel's annexation of Judea and Samaria, instead saying the matter would resolve itself 'automatically.' 'I think that's going to work out very well. That's not really what we're talking about today. I think that's something that is going to work out automatically and it is in good shape.' 'And we discussed it,' Trump continued, nodding towards King Abdullah. 'Other people have discussed it with us and with me. And the West Bank is going to work out well.' Trump reiterated his demand that Hamas release all remaining Israeli hostages by this coming Saturday. 'I don't want to do two [hostages] and then we do another two and another week, and then we do 4 and 3 weeks. No, no. They either have them out by Saturday at 12:00 or all bets are off.'

‘Israel must seize Trump’s Gaza opportunity’ – Smotrich	Mr. Prime Minister, give the order' to resume fighting against Hamas and conquer the Gaza Strip, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said. By World Israel News Staff Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionism) called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seize the historic opportunity to resume the war in Gaza Strip and resettle its residents elsewhere, saying that doing so would also help recover Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. 'Mr. Prime Minister, I urge you, following such a moral, simple, and clear statement by President Trump, to inform Hamas unequivocally: either all the hostages are released by Saturday – no more phases, no more games, or the gates of hell will be opened on them,' Smotrich said in a video statement released on his social media channels. Smotrich said that Israel must immediately halt all humanitarian aid, electricity, fuel, and water to the Strip, in order to achieve a decisive victory over Hamas. In order to win the war and eliminate the security threat posed to Israel, Smotrich continued, Israel must launch a 'complete conquest' of the Gaza Strip, which would see 'all Gazans' expelled from the region. Officially annexing Gaza and assuming it as the only 'painful price' understood by Israel's enemies, he said. 'Mr. Prime Minister, this is the only way to keep our hostages alive and bring them home as quickly as possible. We have all the international backing on this matter. Give the order,' Smotrich added. Despite a green light from Trump to resume fighting against the Hamas terror group if it does not release the some 70 remaining Israeli hostages by Saturday, it's unclear whether Israel intends to leverage the opportnity provided by the U.S. president. Various Israeli government officials have released conflicting statements to Hebrew-language media regarding Israel's official stance on Trump's statement. Some media outlets quoted ministers as saying that Israel would hold Hamas to Trump's deadline, while others said that it was demanding Hamas release just nine hostages originally scheduled to be freed in the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to publicly confirm that he endorses Trump's demand that all of the hostages be released by the end of the week.

Preparing for war? Hamas bans phone use among leadership	Fearing Israeli assassinations, Hamas' senior political and military leadership ditch phones to avoid being tracked, go into hiding. By World Israel News Staff Hamas has ordered a ban on the use of mobile phones by senior leadership, within both its military and politburo divisions, suggesting that the terror group is preparing for the collapse of the ceasefire and a return to fighting against Israel. Sources from Hamas told Arabic-language news outlet Asharq Al-Awsat that the terror group's leaders and its intelligence unit issued a directive to all commanders to stop using their phones, in order to prevent being tracked by Israel, and immediately go into hiding. Many of Hamas' senior leadership had resumed using their phones during the ceasefire, according to the report. The terror group is particularly concerned about surprise assassinations via Israeli airstrikes, especially as reconnaissance aircraft carrying missiles have returned to the skies over several areas of the Gaza Strip, Asharq Al-Awsat reported. Earlier this week, Hamas said that it would delay the release of Israeli captives until further notice, a direct violation of the ceasefire and hostage deal. The group claimed that Israel had not fulfilled its obligations under the agreement regarding the amount of humanitarian aid entering the Strip - a charge that Israel vehemently denies. According to Hamas sources, the terror group is gearing up for a number of scenarios, including a resumption of the war. Hamas is preparing for Israel to retake control of the Netzarim Corridor, a strategic passage dividing northern Gaza from the south, from which Israel withdrew earlier this week. The terror group believes that Israel may also redeploy and bolster troop forces to establish buffer zones, expected to be about half a kilometer into Gazan territory from the border fence with Israel. Following threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, it's unclear whether Hamas intends to stand by its earlier pledge to not release Israeli hostages this Saturday. 'Hamas is committed to the ceasefire agreement that [Israel] also committed to,' a Hamas spokesman said in a media statement on Tuesday night. 'We affirm that [Israel] is the party that did not abide by its commitments and is responsible for any complications or delays.' The post Preparing for war?

‘No famine in Gaza, Strip flooded with aid’ – Israeli official	The amount of food that enters Gaza every day is enormous,' Israeli official says, stressing that shortages are created by Hamas hoarding aid. By World Israel News Staff There is no 'famine' in the Gaza Strip, as trucks loaded with 'enormous' amounts of food and other humanitarian aid enter the coastal enclave every day, an Israeli official confirmed to Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv on Tuesday. The Hamas terror group and international media reports have promoted the narrative that Gazans are suffering from a lack of food during the ongoing conflict, sparking international investigations into Israel's prosecution of the war. But the sheer amount of aid trucks, carrying food, fuel, medical supplies, and more proves that the only shortages in the Strip are created by Hamas' hoarding of aid, an Israeli official responsible for aid distribution said. 'There is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza,' the official told Ma'ariv, adding that some 400 trucks enter the Strip on a daily basis. These aid convoys include trucks loaded with tents, diesel, fuel, and food products, the official continued. The official stressed that there is 'no shortage of any humanitarian materials inside Gaza,' with some of the trucks carrying 'blankets and warm clothes to the residents of the Strip.' The source added that trucks 'loaded with medical equipment through the Jordan River crossing.' Another official told Ma'ariv that 'the amount of food that enters Gaza every day is enormous.' They emphasized that 'there is no hunger there, and there are no problems deriving from food shortages.' The official acknowledged that Hamas terrorists regularly seize humanitarian aid, preventing goods from reaching civilians and oftentimes selling the goods for exorbitant prices on the black market. 'Hamas manages the distribution of aid within Gaza,' the official said. 'It has specific groups within the population that are given higher priority and favoritism, but we are not responsible for what goes on once the aid is in the Strip.' In recent months, some watchdog groups have quietly walked back their claims that the Gazans are starving. Video circulating on social media of Gazans, particularly footage of them gathering to watch the releases of Israeli hostages, has failed to show mass starvation of the population.

Which captives have not yet been freed in first phase of hostage ...	The list of 17 includes five older men, nine men under 50, a mother and two children. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As Hamas threatens cessation of the release of Israeli captives and Israel issues an ultimatum to restart the war if they are not freed, there are still 17 hostages slated for release in Phase One of the agreement. A total of 33 hostages were meant to be released in Phase One of the hostage deal, and 16 have already returned home, leaving 76 captives remaining in Gaza. Those scheduled for release in the first phase of the deal are in the 'humanitarian' category, including women, children, the elderly, and ill hostages. Of the 33, eight of them are reported to have died, with no indication of their identities. The emaciated appearance of Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy, and Eli Sharabi, who were released last Saturday, has led many to call for the urgent release of all the hostages. Former US President Donald Trump declared that if all hostages are not released by Saturday, 'all hell would break loose.' Following Trump's announcement, Netanyahu declared that the war would resume if the hostages are not freed by the Saturday deadline. The 17 hostages slated for release at the end of Phase One are: Itzik Elgarat, Shlomo Mantzur, Ohad Yahalom, Oded Lifshitz, Tsahi Idan, Hisham al-Sayed, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, Omer Wenkert, Sasha Trufanov, Eliza Cohen, Aver Mengistu, Tal Shoham, Omer Shem-Tov, Shiri Bibas, Ariel Bibas and Kfir Bibas. On Tuesday, Shlomo Mantzur, aged 86, was reported to have been killed in captivity. The list of 17 includes five older men, nine men under 50, a mother and two children. The Bibas mother and children were supposed to have been released earlier in the hostage release deal; the father, Yarden Bibas, has already been freed. Israel has asked Hamas for clarification on the status of the Bibas family, but Hamas has not provided information, and the IDF spokesman expressed 'grave concern' about their fate.

Trump to Jordan’s King Abdullah: ‘We will take Gaza’	King Abdullah said Jordan would not take in additional Gazans and would do what was in the best interests of his country. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan on Tuesday, the President Donald Trump said that the US would take control of Gaza. He explained, 'Palestinians will live safely in another location that is not Gaza,' adding that the US would 'run it very properly.' Trump said that Gaza would come under US authority but that he would not personally be involved in its development. The president also predicted that Hamas would not meet the Saturday deadline to release all of the hostages and added, 'If this happens, 'all bets are off.'' When Trump suggested there must be areas in Jordan and Egypt where Gazan civilians could go, King Abdullah responded that although he was willing to take in 2,000 sick Gazan children, his focus would be on what is most beneficial to Jordan. Trump reminded the king that the US provides significant aid to Egypt and Jordan. Although King Abdullah posted on Twitter that his meeting with Trump was 'constructive,' he 'reiterated Jordan's steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.' He stated that a two-state solution is 'the way to ensure regional stability,' adding, 'This requires US leadership.' He also called President Trump 'a man of peace' and praised him for being instrumental in securing the Gaza ceasefire.

3 million Israelis battle war-related mental trauma, anxiety, and...	The comptroller’s report also criticized the government’s guidelines on who can be legally recognized for support under Israel’s Victims of Hostilities Compensation Law. By Sveta Listratov, TPS An estimated three million Israelis are suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome, depression and anxiety after more than a year of war, but the nation’s mental health system is not adequately meeting public needs, according to a State Comptroller report released on Tuesday. 'It is inconceivable that people have to wait half a year to see a psychiatrist,' said State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman, adding that he had warned the government of these failures a month after the attack, but the necessary reforms have not yet been fully implemented. The comptroller, also known as the state ombudsman, periodically releases reports auditing Israeli preparedness and the effectiveness of government policies. The report highlighted systemic failures in providing psychological support to survivors, evacuees and first responders, and estimated that three million people are not receiving proper care. According to the report, Israel’s mental health infrastructure, which was already struggling before October 7, 'failed to provide necessary treatment.' The report found that 90% of those experiencing PTSD symptoms have not sought treatment, many citing long wait times as the main barrier. Even among those who tried, the average waiting period for treatment is 6.5 months. Eiyar Segal, a clinical social worker specializing in trauma, emergency situations, and resilience training, told The Press Service of Israel that a major shift in treatment methods is required to address the overwhelming demand. Segal spent 20 years as a mental health officer in the Israel Defense Forces. 'We need to move away from an over-reliance on individual therapy and prioritize group therapy, which has proven to be both effective and resource-efficient,' she told TPS-IL. According to her, group therapy can treat 12 patients in the same time it takes to treat one person individually, allowing for a wider reach. Key factors that help individuals recover from emergency trauma include strong social connections and a sense of purpose. 'People who actively engage with their communities, whether by volunteering, joining support groups, or maintaining close relationships, tend to cope better,' she told TPS-IL. Segal also stressed the importance of structured routines and physical activity to help restore a sense of normalcy and control. Overconsumption of distressing news and excessive exposure to traumatic content can worsen anxiety and prolong the stress response, she noted. The comptroller’s report also criticized the government’s guidelines on who can be legally recognized for support under Israel’s Victims of Hostilities Compensation Law. In particular, first responders and volunteers — who evacuated victims under fire and then spent weeks recovering hundreds of mutilated bodies — were left without government support for their own mental health care. For example, the report found that only 1% of ZAKA volunteers from Tel Aviv and 13% from ZAKA Israel received psychological support. Despite existing emergency scenarios predicting mass evacuations, the comptrollers’ report said the Ministry of Health was unprepared to handle the psychological fallout. Services were initially staffed by volunteers with no official oversight, and many evacuees received no structured treatment. 'Building community support networks and integrating mental health education into daily life is crucial,' Segal told TPS-IL. 'We cannot wait for another crisis—we need to proactively strengthen mental health services across the country.' Mental health preparedness should not be an afterthought but a fundamental part of national security and community resilience, she insisted. 'Trauma doesn’t just disappear with time—it requires structured intervention. Investing in mental health today means a stronger, more resilient society tomorrow.' Said Englman, 'The State of Israel has a moral obligation to care for trauma victims. The government must ensure long-term funding and reform mental health services to prevent a national crisis.'

Netanyahu: Ceasefire ends unless hostages are freed on Saturday	He has ordered the IDF to amass forces in and around the Gaza Strip 'in light of Hamas’s statement about its decision to violate the [ceasefire] agreement,' Netanyahu said. By JNS Unless Hamas returns Israeli hostages by noon on Saturday, Feb. 15, the ceasefire will expire and the Israel Defense Forces will resume fighting until it defeats Hamas totally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. The statement by Netanyahu announcing the ultimatum followed remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, who also named Saturday, Feb. 15 at noon as the time after which 'all hell will break loose' unless Hamas frees all hostages. Netanyahu addressed Trump’s demand and credited him for his 'revolutionary vision for the future of Gaza, which we all welcomed,' he said, referencing the security cabinet. Netanyahu’s ultimatum followed an 'in-depth, four-hour discussion' by the cabinet, he wrote. 'We all expressed outrage at the shocking state of our three hostages who were freed last Saturday. We all also welcomed President Trump’s demand for the release of our hostages by noon on Saturday,' the prime minister wrote. He has ordered the IDF to amass forces in and around the Gaza Strip 'in light of Hamas’s statement about its decision to violate the [ceasefire] agreement,' Netanyahu said. This action is being carried out and would be completed shortly, he added. 'Unless Hamas returns our hostages by noon on Saturday, the ceasefire will end and the IDF will resume intensive fighting until Hamas is totally defeated,' his statement concluded. אם חמאס לא יחזיר את חטופינו עד שבת בצהריים - הפסקת האש תיפסק, וצה'ל יחזור ללחימה עצימה עד להכרעה סופית של החמאס pic.twitter.com/4Cx30kHGvN — Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) February 11, 2025 The post Netanyahu: Ceasefire ends unless hostages are freed on Saturday appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/netanyahu-ceasefire-ends-unless-hostages-are-freed-on-saturday/	2025-02-11T09:46:34-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/F241027MISPOOL14-scaled.jpg
Idan Amedi not returning for Season 5 of hit show ‘Fauda’	Amedi, 36, was wounded in January last year in an explosion in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, which killed six soldiers and injured several others. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Israeli actor and musician Idan Amedi will not reprise his role as undercover operative Sagi Tzur in the upcoming fifth season of Fauda. Amedi, who was seriously injured while serving in Gaza and is undergoing a long rehabilitation process, informed the show’s producers that he would be unable to participate in the new season. 'The filming schedule conflicted with Amedi’s planned international tour, making it impossible for him to participate in the new season' explained a statement to The Press Service of Israel from the public relations office of Sari Israeli, which represents the actor-musician. Amedi is scheduled to perform in Jerusalem on February 19, his birthday. Amedi, 36, was wounded in January last year in an explosion in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, which killed six soldiers and injured several others. He was hospitalized for over two weeks at Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan. Despite the injury, he has announced a return to the stage, with performances scheduled to begin this month. Upon his release from the hospital in January last year, when asked how his rehabilitation would impact the filming of Fauda, which was already known to be renewed for its fifth season, Amedi said, 'The creators are already working to adapt the script to our current reality. I will be back in the series with God’s help next season.' Now it is confirmed that the show’s creators will have to find a way to write out his character, Sagi Tzur, in the upcoming season. Amedi, who joined Fauda in 2017, is also a well-known singer-songwriter. His debut song, 'A Warrior’s Pain,' became one of Israel’s most iconic songs in 2010. Last month, he released Superman, his first album since being wounded, which was met with great success. Over the years, he has released six albums, blending themes of military service, resilience, and Israeli identity.

Gulf of Mexico becomes Gulf of America on US Google Maps	For most Americans who have an updated version of Google Maps, they should only see 'Gulf of America.' Mexican users should only see 'Gulf of Mexico,' while international users see both names. By Jewish Breaking News For centuries, the waters between the United States and Mexico have been known by a single name. That changed Monday when Google Maps users in the United States opened their apps to find a new label on their screens. The change stems from one of numerous executive orders signed on inauguration day by President Donald Trump as part of a broader executive push to 'restore American pride in the history of American greatness.' He also revoked an Obama-era decision to officially recognize Denali by reverting it back to Mount McKinley. For Google users, geography now depends on location. For most Americans who have an updated version of Google Maps, they should only see 'Gulf of America.' Mexican users should only see 'Gulf of Mexico,' while international users see both names. The move was expected after the tech giant announced in January that it would implement the change once the United States Geographic Names Information System was updated. However, not all tech companies have fallen in line, as Apple Maps still displays the Gulf of Mexico. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum isn’t letting the change go unchallenged. Last month, the Jewish president announced that she will be preparing a formal letter to Google questioning their decision to alter a name that has identified these waters since the 16th century. 'For us it is still the Gulf of Mexico, and for the entire world it is still the Gulf of Mexico,' Sheinbaum said. 'By the way, we are also going to ask for Mexican America to appear on the map.' But Google so far is standing by the change, pointing to existing policies that adjust map labels based on users’ locations such as operating system settings, SIM cards, and network connections.

Report: Egypt’s president snubs Trump ahead of planned meeting	El-Sisi reportedly suspends planned meeting with Trump as Cairo threatens to nix peace treaty with Israel if US cuts aid over Egypt's refusal to take in Gazans. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is reportedly refusing to meet with President Donald Trump, over Trump's plan to relocate the Gaza Strip's entire population to third-party countries, including Egypt. On Tuesday, Al Araby al-Jadeen cited multiple diplomatic sources claiming that el-Sisi has suspended plans to meet with his American counterpart, Donald Trump, amid the continuing disagreement between the two leaders over Trump's Gaza plan, which was first unveiled last week. Two Egyptian security officials told Reuters Wednesday that el-Sisi will not visit the White House if the mass relocation of Gazans is on the agenda. In addition, Al Araby al-Jadeen reported that Egypt is threatening to end the decades-old peace treaty with Israel if the Trump administration terminates American aid to Egypt over Cairo's opposition to the Gaza resettlement plan. On February 1, Trump spoke with el-Sisi by phone, the White House said, making no mention of the U.S. president's Gaza plan, though a readout of the call said they discussed the Gaza Strip. This past Sunday, Israeli President Isaac Herzog revealed that Trump is slated to meet with a number of senior Arab leaders, including Jordan's King Abdullah II, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, and el-Sisi. All three have publicly rejected Trump's plan to resettle Gaza's population in third-party countries. On Monday, Trump said he may halt American aid to Cairo and Amman if Egypt and Jordan refuse to take in Gaza refugees. The U.S. gives Egypt an estimated $2.1 billion annually, and $1.4 billion to Jordan. In response, diplomatic sources told Al Araby al-Jadeen, Egypt is mulling terminating the 1979 peace treaty with Israel, signed after Prime Minister Menachem Begin agreed to hand over the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. 'Egypt has decided to take precautions against any potential halt of U.S. aid and has prepared emergency plans to deal with U.S. pressure regarding the displacement issue,' sources cited by Tuesday's report claimed.

Hostage’s niece calls to halt Gaza aid if Hamas delays hostage re...	Yael Savariego’s demand echoes that of former internal security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Yael Savariego, niece of Hamas hostage Lior Rudaeff, demanded Tuesday that all humanitarian aid to Hamas be stopped if the terrorists fulfill their threat not to continue with the hostage deal. 'If Hamas indeed does not honor the agreement and we do not see hostages returning home on Saturday, we call on the Prime Minister, the Israeli government, the Cabinet members, and all decision-makers: immediately stop the aid to the enemy. Immediately stop the aid trucks to the Gaza Strip, do everything to resume the negotiations on this deal, and bring about the release of all the hostages, bar none,' said Savariego. Since her uncle was murdered while defending his kibbutz, Nir Yitzhak, from the Hamas-led invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023, the psychotherapist has been one of the leading voices of Tzav 9, a group that believed from the start that no humanitarian aid should enter Gaza unless the hostages are released first. Her call echoed that of former internal security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, whose party left the government in protest over the dangers of the current deal, reacted to Hamas’ announcement by urging a full-scale assault on Gaza 'from the air and the ground,' and later submitting a bill to the Knesset that would halt all aid deliveries. The explanatory portion of the proposed law recalled that 'At the start of the war, the State of Israel halted all humanitarian aid, severely impacting [Hamas] and leading to the first hostage exchange deal' in which 'eighty hostages were released' in exchange for a temporary ceasefire, the release of Palestinian prisoners, fuel and aid. Although Hamas broke the deal and the war resumed, humanitarian aid has continued to flow 'that in effect, gives the terrorist organization 'oxygen' to continue controlling the area, reorganizing again and again, and above all, surviving.' 'Everyone understands,' the bill concluded, 'that stopping humanitarian aid and conditioning it upon the release of all hostages is the only pressure mechanism that will compel Hamas to act.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, whose Religious Zionism party remained in the government while saying that to ensure its long-term security Israel cannot agree to Hamas’ demand to fully withdraw from Gaza, which was included in the next phase of the deal, was of similar mind. He told a faction meeting Monday that the only way to return the abductees is for people to take their anger about the hostages’ plight and 'take it out on the murderers in Hamas,' but with a change in tactics instead of 'doing more of the same.' 'We need to completely stop the transfer of humanitarian aid to Hamas,' he said. 'Permanently occupy territory as a response to the terrible massacre and to prevent the next massacre.' 'Of course,' he added, 'we should also take determined action to &#8230; encourage the migration of Gaza residents in cooperation with President Trump, who understands well the root of the conflict and the only realistic solution. Only in this way can we truly do everything, everything, to release all the hostages and destroy the Hamas threat.'

USAID provided assistance to Al Qaeda, Hezbollah terrorists – rep...	The agency targeted by the Trump administration reportedly funded a future senior Al Qaeda recruiter’s college tuition and sent supplies to Hezbollah. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News As more and more cases of fraud and corruption are exposed at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), two more cases of its support of Muslim terrorists have come to light. The New York Post reported Tuesday that an Israeli soldier had found boxes marked 'USAID' among a cache of sniper rifles, anti-tank missiles and explosives in a village in southern Lebanon. Asher Fredman, who in civilian life is the executive director of the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, told the daily that he had found the items in a village set up to be a 'forward base' for Hezbollah in its plans to invade Israel. NGOMonitor founder Gerald Steinberg said last week that 'The folks at USAID knew that taxpayers’ money and ‘emergency assistance’ went to terrorists.' In just one example of many, according to a source in the Washington Free Beacon, less than a week before Hamas’ Oct. 7 invasion of Israel, USAID handed $900,000 'to a terror charity in Gaza involved with the son of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.' In the second reported case, USAID assisted a future senior Al Qaeda member due to improper vetting. Fox News reported Monday on documents that have been found showing that the agency approved the request of one Anwar al-Aulaqi to fully fund his college studies in Colorado in 1990 without checking his bona fides. He claimed that he had been born in Yemen and wanted to study civil engineering as an exchange student when in reality he was born in the United States and was thus ineligible for such aid. He soon became an imam, preaching in several U.S. mosques, and serving as vice president of a charity that U.S. authorities said was a front to fund Al Qaeda. While in San Diego he also reportedly became close with two of the 9/11 hijackers, but was never charged in context with the movement’s attacks on the Twin Towers and Pentagon in 2001 although he was interrogated several times. When his fraud of USAID was discovered in 2002 he was tipped off that the authorities were investigating, and he fled, reaching Yemen in 2004, where he officially joined Al Qaeda and rose higher and higher in its ranks. His main role with the terrorists was as a senior recruiter, radicalizing many English-speaking, young Muslims, teaching them about jihad through popular motivational online videos and writings. He also was in close contact with two men who eventually carried out terrorist attacks in 2009. One was Major Nidal Hasan, who murdered 13 soldiers and injured more than 30 in a shooting in Fort Hood, Texas. The other was Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian who attempted to blow up a Detroit-bound plane on Christmas Day by detonating plastic explosives hidden in his underwear. Al-Aulaqi was eventually killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, ordered by then-president Barack Obama, who called it a 'significant milestone in the broader effort to defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates.' President Donald Trump is intent on closing down USAID, firing more than 90% of its staff, and putting its humanitarian functions within the purview of the State Department.

Israeli minister: Trump backs Israel annexing 5% of Gaza for ever...	Senior Israeli minister says Israel must issue its own ultimatum to Hamas and threaten to annex parts of the Gaza Strip every time a hostage is harmed, claiming Trump fully backs such a move. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior Israeli government minister has proposed Israel take punitive steps against the Hamas terror organization, including the incremental annexation of the Gaza Strip in response to the harming of Israeli hostages. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) put forth a plan Tuesday for pressuring Hamas into returning Israeli hostages, after the terror group announced Monday that was suspending the scheduled release of Israeli hostages, slated for this coming Saturday. Speaking at a conference on the integration of the ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) population, Smotrich laid out his plan to pressure Hamas. 'We need to set an ultimatum for Hamas,' Smotrich said, a day after Trump issued his own ultimatum, demanding the terror group release all Israeli hostages still in captivity by Saturday at noon. 'Cut off their electricity and water and stop the humanitarian aid,' Smotrich said. 'We must open the gates of hell.' The minister further proposed that for every hostage harmed in captivity, Israel will annex 5% of the Gaza Strip - a position he claimed has the backing of President Donald Trump. 'For each hostage that something&#8230;happens to, on that same day, we will annex 5% of the Gaza Strip. We have the full backing of President Trump.' In addition, Smotrich called on the IDF to actively search out and arrest every Palestinian terrorist freed as part of the deal with Hamas. 'We need to notify Hamas the moment we return to war, we need to rearrest all the terrorists whom we released.' 'In Gaza, there will be no Hamas, there will be no enemies, and there will be no threat to Israel. It will again be part of the State of Israel, since it is our land and that is the only way to ensure the security of the State of Israel.'

Some Israeli soldiers traveling abroad are targeted for alleged w...	The director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, Eden Bar-Tal, last month said fewer than a dozen soldiers had been targeted, and he dismissed the attempted arrests as a futile public relations stunt by 'terrorist organizations.' By The Associated Press An Israeli army reservist's dream vacation in Brazil ended abruptly last month over an accusation that he committed war crimes in the Gaza Strip. Yuval Vagdani woke up on Jan. 4 to a flurry of missed calls from family members and Israel's Foreign Ministry with an urgent warning: A pro-Palestinian legal group had convinced a federal judge in Brazil to open a war crimes investigation for his alleged participation in the demolition of civilian homes in Gaza. A frightened Vagdani fled the country on a commercial flight the next day to avoid the grip of a powerful legal concept called 'universal jurisdiction,' which allows governments to prosecute people for the most serious crimes regardless of where they are allegedly committed. Vagdani, a survivor of Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack on an Israeli music festival, told an Israeli radio station the accusation felt like 'a bullet in the heart.' The case against Vagdani was brought by the Hind Rajab Foundation, a legal group based in Belgium named after a young girl who Palestinians claim was killed early in the war by Israeli fire as she and her family fled Gaza City. Aided by geolocation data, the group built its case around Vagdani's own social media posts. A photograph showed him in uniform in Gaza, where he served in an infantry unit; a video showed a large explosion of buildings in Gaza during which soldiers can be heard cheering. Judges at the International Criminal Court concluded last year there was enough evidence to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for crimes against humanity for using 'starvation as a method of warfare' and for intentionally targeting civilians. Both Israel and Netanyahu have vehemently denied the accusations. Since forming last year, Hind Rajab has made dozens of complaints in more than 10 countries to arrest both low-level and high-ranking Israeli soldiers. Its campaign has yet to yield any arrests. However, it has led Israel to tighten restrictions on social media usage among military personnel. 'It’s our responsibility, as far as we are concerned, to bring the cases,' Haroon Raza, a co-founder of Hind Rajab, said from his office in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It is then up to authorities in each country — or the International Criminal Court — to pursue them, he added. The director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, Eden Bar-Tal, last month said fewer than a dozen soldiers had been targeted, and he dismissed the attempted arrests as a futile public relations stunt by 'terrorist organizations.' Universal jurisdiction is not new. The 1949 Geneva Conventions — the post Second World War treaty regulating military conduct — specify that all signatories must prosecute war criminals or hand them over to a country that will. In 1999, the United Nations Security Council asked all U.N. countries to include universal jurisdiction in their legal codes, and around 160 countries have adopted them in some form. 'Certain crimes like war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity are crimes under international law,' said Marieke de Hoon, an international law expert at the University of Amsterdam. 'And we’ve recognized in international law that any state has jurisdiction over those egregious crimes.' Israel used the concept to prosecute Adolf Eichmann, an architect of the Holocaust. Mossad agents caught him in Argentina in 1960 and brought him to Israel where he was sentenced to death by hanging. More recently, a former Syrian secret police officer was convicted in 2022 by a German court of crimes against humanity a decade earlier for overseeing the abuse of detainees at a jail. Later that year, an Iranian citizen was convicted by a Swedish court of war crimes during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. In 2023, 16 people were convicted of war crimes through universal jurisdiction, according to TRIAL International, a Swiss organization that tracks proceedings. Those convictions were related to crimes committed in Syria, Rwanda, Iran and other countries. In response to Brazil's pursuit of Vagdani, the Israeli military has prohibited soldiers below a certain rank from being named in news articles and requires their faces to be obscured. It has also warned soldiers against social media posts related to their military service or travel plans. The evidence Hind Rajab lawyers presented to the judge in Brazil came mostly from Vagdani’s social media accounts. 'That's what they saw and that's why they want me for their investigation,' he told the Israeli radio station Kan. 'From one house explosion they made 500 pages. They thought I murdered thousands of children.' Vagdani does not appear in the video and he did not say whether he had carried out the explosion himself, telling the station he had come into Gaza for 'maneuvers' and 'was in the battles of my life.' Social media has made it easier in recent years for legal groups to gather evidence. For example, several Islamic State terrorists have been convicted of crimes committed in Syria by courts in various European countries, where lawyers relied on videos posted online, according to de Hoon. The power of universal jurisdiction has limits. In the Netherlands, where Hind Rajab has filed more than a dozen complaints, either the victim or perpetrator must hold Dutch nationality, or the suspect must be in the country for the entirety of the investigation — factors likely to protect Israeli tourists from prosecution. Eleven complaints against 15 Israeli soldiers have been dismissed, some because the accused was only in the country for a short time, according to Dutch prosecutors. Two complaints involving four soldiers are pending. In 2016, activists in the U.K. made unsuccessful attempts to arrest Israeli military and political leaders for their roles in the 2008-09 war in Gaza. Raza says his group will persist. 'It might take 10 years. It might be 20 years. No problem. We are ready to have patience.' There is no statute of limitations on war crimes.

Two Jewish actors take top honors at Critics Choice Awards	While both actors are Jewish, they are not related. By Jewish Breaking News This year’s Critics Choice Awards notched big wins for two Jewish actors, with Adam Brody taking home best actor in a comedy series for his role as Rabbi Noah Roklov in Netflix’s hit interfaith romcom 'Nobody Wants This.' Adrien Brody won best actor in a drama for portraying a Holocaust survivor in 'The Brutalist.' In a fitting touch, Rachel Brosnahan, herself recognized for bringing Jewish representation to television as the star of 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,' presented Adam Brody with his award on Friday night in Santa Monica. 'Thank you for your talent, thank you for your kindness, thank you for your belief in me,' he told costar Kristen Bell. 'This is a Hanukkah present for you.' During the ceremony cameras captured a tender moment between the actor and his wife Leighton Meester, with whom he has two children. The pair lost their home in last month’s Palisades Fire in Los Angeles. 'Nobody Wants This' has been a surprise cultural phenomenon since its September launch, sparking widespread conversations about its portrayal of Jewish life and interfaith relationships. The show is set to begin filming its second season early this year. Taking the stage for his own award, Adrien Brody praised critics for making his 'very small, epic film very visible and accessible to people.' In The Brutalist, he plays a Jewish architect and Holocaust survivor who clashes with a wealthy patron after emigrating to the US. While both actors are Jewish, they are not related.

UN chief appeals to Hamas to release Israeli hostages	Hamas announced on Monday night that it would delay the hostage release scheduled for Feb. 15 until further notice due to what it alleged were Israeli violations of the truce. By JNS U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres on Tuesday urged the Hamas terror group to abide by its obligation to release additional Israeli hostages in accordance with its ceasefire agreement with the Jewish state. 'We must avoid at all costs resumption of hostilities in Gaza that would lead to immense tragedy. I appeal to Hamas to proceed with the planned liberation of hostages. Both sides must fully abide by their commitments in the ceasefire agreement & resume serious negotiations,' tweeted Guterres. Hamas announced on Monday night that it would delay the hostage release scheduled for Feb. 15 until further notice due to what it alleged were Israeli violations of the truce. Israel Defense Minister Israel Katz called Hamas’s announcement an 'outright violation of the ceasefire' and said he had instructed the Israeli military 'to prepare at the highest level of alert for any possible scenario in Gaza.' He added: 'We will not return to the reality of October 7.' Then-Foreign Minister Katz declared Guterres persona non grata in the Jewish state in October, hours before Rosh Hashanah began. 'Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran’s heinous attack on Israel, as almost every country in the world has done, does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil,' Katz stated at the time. 'This is a secretary-general who has yet to denounce the massacre and sexual atrocities committed by Hamas murderers on Oct. 7, nor has he led any efforts to declare them a terrorist organization.' 'Israel will continue to defend its citizens and uphold its national dignity, with or without António Guterres,' added Katz, referring to the secretary-general as 'a stain on the history of the United Nations.'

65% of Gaza’s structures said destroyed, reconstruction estimated...	Four thousand buildings within a mile of the Gaza-Israel border with Israel were also destroyed, also amounting to 100% of the structures in that area. By JNS About 65% of the structures in the Gaza Strip were destroyed during the year-long Israel-Hamas war, littering the enclave with hundreds of millions of tons of scattered debris, Hebrew media reported on Tuesday. Experts estimate reconstruction would take at least 10 years and cost tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. The outlet commissioned Adi Ben-Nun, a Geographic Information System (GIS) specialist and technical manager of the GIS center at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, to analyze satellite imagery of the Strip. According to that analysis, approximately 84% (25,927) of the structures in northern Gaza were destroyed (25,927), while in Gaza City the figure was about 72% (35,722). In the central camps some 33% (10,375) of the buildings were destroyed, while the figures for Khan Yunis and Rafah in southern Gaza were 73% (32,908) and 52% (15,434),' respectively. Three other areas stood out with regard to the level of destruction. In Jabaliya, located some 2.5 miles north of Gaza city, about 19,000 buildings were destroyed, or about 100% of the structures in the city. Four thousand buildings within a mile of the Gaza-Israel border with Israel were also destroyed, also amounting to 100% of the structures in that area. There was also total destruction for several miles to the north and south of the Netzarim Corridor separating northern and southern Gaza, according to the report. Satellite images also show that a buffer zone between Israel and Gaza has been completed, according to Channel 12. On Feb. 4, U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, after visiting Gaza, said that the damage he witnessed had convinced him it is currently too dangerous to inhabit. 'There are 30,000 unexploded munitions. It’s buildings that could tip over at any moment. There’s no utilities there whatsoever—no working water, electric, gas. Nothing. God knows what kind of disease might be festering there,' he said. Moreover, terrorist groups in Gaza had undermined the territory, he noted. 'They’ve dug tunnels underneath there that have basically degraded the stone that would form foundations. We have to examine that, and you do it with borings. You do it with subterranean surveys,' he said. The effort would take 'years on top of years,' he stressed, with the disposal effort alone requiring an estimated three to five. 'The president is intent on getting it all done correctly, so for me it is unfair to explain to Palestinians that they might be back in five years. That’s just preposterous,' said Witkoff. He backed U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza, arguing that a better life is not necessarily tied to a given piece of land. In an interview with Fox News, Witkoff emphasized that peace means improving financial conditions and opportunities. 'Peace in the region means a better life for the Palestinians. A better life is not necessarily tied to the physical space that you are in today,' he said. 'A better life is about better opportunity, better financial conditions, better aspirations for you and your family. That doesn’t occur because you get to pitch a tent in the Gaza Strip and you’re surrounded by 30,000 munitions that could go off at any moment,' he added.

Hamas responds to Trump’s ultimatum	United Nations Secretary-General urges Gaza terror group to implement planned hostage release, as Hamas rebuffs President Trump's warning that 'all hell will break loose' if Israeli hostages are not release on Saturday. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization on Tuesday rebuffed an ultimatum issued by President Donald Trump, demanding the Gaza group release all remaining hostages by this coming Saturday. A spokesman for the terror group, Sami Abu Zuhri, told Reuters Tuesday morning that his threats 'have no value,' reiterating its claims that Israel has violated the ceasefire deal. 'Trump must remember that there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties, and this is the only way to bring back the [hostages]. The language of threats has no value and only complicates matters,' Abu Zuhri said. A day earlier, Hamas announced that it will not be releasing Israeli hostages this coming Saturday as planned unless its demands are met. Accusing Israel of delaying the return of Palestinian Arabs to northern Gaza and limiting the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip, Hamas demanded changes on the ground before more hostages are release. Later that day, Trump warned that should Hamas renege on the hostage deal, 'all hell' would break loose. 'If all the Gaza hostages aren’t returned by Saturday at 12:00 p.m., I would say cancel the ceasefire. Let all hell break loose,' Trump said, adding, 'Israel can override it.' United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a statement Tuesday morning, urging Hamas to adhere to the hostage release schedule and to free the captives slated to be returned to Israel this Saturday. 'We must avoid at all costs the resumption of hostilities in Gaza that would lead to an immense tragedy,' Guterres said. 'I appeal to Hamas to proceed with the planned liberation of hostages next Saturday.' Guterres also called on Israel and Hamas to reach a deal to implement the second phase of the three-part truce agreement. 'Both sides must fully abide by their commitments in the cease-fire agreement and resume serious negotiations in Doha for the second phase.'

Elderly hostage slated for release reported dead	Shlomo Mansour was killed while in Hamas captivity, officials from his hometown say, while family of twin brothers held hostage say they have received a sign of life. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News An elderly Israeli hostage taken captive by Hamas terrorists during the October 7th, 2023 invasion was killed while in captivity, officials from his hometown announced Tuesday morning. Shlomo Mansour, 86, was among the 251 people abducted by Gaza terrorists on October 7th, 2023, and forced over the border into the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday, Kibbutz Kissufim, the Gaza border community where Mansour had resided, issued a statement saying that Mansour had been murdered by Hamas terrorists while in captivity. 'With a heavy heart, we kibbutz members received the news this morning of the murder in Hamas captivity of our dear friend, Shlomo Mansour, 86, who was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Kissufim in the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7, 2023,' the statement reads in part. The kibbutz did not provide details regarding how Mansour's death was confirmed. 'This is one of the most difficult days in the history of our kibbutz. Shlomo was much more than a community member to us – he was a father, a grandfather, a true friend and the beating heart of Kissufim,' the kibbutz said. 'His smile, modesty and human warmth were an inspiration to us all. Our hearts are broken that we were unable to bring him back to us alive. The entire community grieves his loss and is united in grief and pain.' Due to his advanced age, Mansour had been included in the list of 33 Israeli hostages slated for release during the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Prior to Tuesday, however, there were no reports Mansour had been killed in captivity. According to Hamas, eight of the hostages slated for release are dead, though the terror group has not identified which captives are no longer alive. Also on Tuesday, the family of twin brothers taken hostage on October 7th reported receiving a sign of life of the two men. Relatives of Gali Berman and his brother Ziv, 27, of Kibbutz Kfar Aza said they have received information regarding their condition. 'We take a deep breath, but we know whose hands they are in and how much danger their lives are in,' the family said Tuesday.

‘Nobody wants to die’ – Trump says Iran ‘very nervous,’ ready for...	President Trump blasts Obama's 2015 Iran nuclear agreement as 'the dumbest deal,' says Iran cannot be allowed to achieve a nuclear capacity, with only a new deal or Israeli airstrikes capable of preventing them from achieving it. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump warned that Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons either through a new deal to replace the 2015 nuclear agreement, or airstrikes on the country's atomic facilities. Speaking with Fox News on Monday night, the president said that while he preferred to resolve the issue via negotiations, he will not allow Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons. 'Everyone thinks Israel, with our help or our approval, will go in and bomb the hell out of [Iran],' Trump said. 'I would prefer that not happen. I'd much rather see a deal with Iran where we can do a deal, supervise, check it, inspect it, and then blow it up or just make sure that there's no more nuclear.' Trump went on to deride the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed by the Obama administration, as 'the dumbest deal.' 'By the way, that would have expired by now. That was a road to a nuclear weapon. It was a short-term deal,' Trump said of the JCPOA's sunset clause, under which certain restrictions would automatically end after 10 years. 'You can't make a deal with just a few years on it. That deal would be expired by now. Think of it. And they would have a legal right to have a nuclear weapon.' 'You cannot allow Iran, or just about anybody else, by the way, but especially Iran, because they are very militant. You can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon.' Trump claimed that Iran's leadership is 'very concerned' over Tehran's increasing isolation regionally and internationally, following Israeli airstrikes last year, the new sanctions imposed by the Trump White House and the loss of key allies over the past six months including the Assad regime, Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah, and Hamas' Yahya Sinwar. 'But there's two ways of stopping them, with bombs or with a written piece of paper. And I'd much rather do a deal that's a deal that's not going to hurt them.' 'I think that Iran is very concerned. I think that Iran is very frightened, to be honest with you, because their defense is pretty much gone.' 'They've had some very bad moments. The whole thing with the [Hezbollah] pagers was a disaster for them. The pagers, you know what I'm talking about.' 'It was a horrible thing, but it was, you know, it knocked out a lot of leadership like nobody's ever seen before. But I think Iran is very nervous. I think they're scared. I think Iran would love to make a deal, and I would love to make a deal with them without bombing them.'

Arab-Israeli murder rate 3rd-highest in developed world – study	Arab Israelis face a murder rate rivaling that of Mexico and Colombia, with no signs of slowing down. By World Israel News Staff The murder rate among Arab Israelis is one of the worst in the developed world, with the number of killings per 100,000 people nearing that of Mexico, a recent study found. According to a study published by the Taub Center, a Jerusalem-based nonprofit organization focusing on Israeli societal issues, 233 Arab Israelis were murdered in 2023, the most recent year in which full data was available. Notably, the number of Jewish victims of homicide during that same year (those killed in criminal incidents, not terror attacks) was just 66, akin to the murder rate in Switzerland. 'Israeli Arabs, with a current rate of 11.1 homicides per 100,000 people and 43.9 homicides per 100,000 people aged 20‒34, climb to the 3rd-highest position, far surpassing the U.S. and trailing only Mexico and Colombia,' wrote researchers from the Taub Center. 'From a sociological perspective, this makes sense,' they added. 'A culture of violence tends to spread and become entrenched, as has happened among the Arab population in recent years, and violence tends to increase, especially during periods of instability in the country, as we have been experiencing in Israel over the past year.' Arab Israelis have long complained that the Israeli police have neglected their communities, but suggestions to use Shin Bet resources and other alternatives to clamp down on murders have been rejected by the sector's leadership. Police often are unable to prosecute murder cases involving Arab victims, even when they are able to identify the perpetrators, because members of the community are typically unwilling to testify in court or cooperate with the authorities. 'We are committed to taking decisive action against crime and violence using all available resources to increase security in the Arab community,' the Israel Police said in a media statement to Hebrew-language outlet Globes. 'Over the past year, we have prevented dozens of murders by intercepting criminals before they could carry out their plans, thwarted weapons smuggling, and seized thousands of illegal weapon, each one potentially saving lives. The Police Commissioner has ordered an increase in forces and the use of all necessary tools to locate and arrest violent offenders who pose a threat to public safety.'

NY Times Oct. 7th war coverage ‘distorted, imbalanced’ – Study	Data analysis finds that the New York Times presented Palestinian death statistics without mentioning Hamas fighters killed battling IDF troops, glossed over murders of Israeli civilians in terror attacks and bombings. By World Israel News Staff A data analyses of some 1,500 articles about the October 7th massacres and subsequent Israel-Hamas war published by the New York Times revealed that the media outlet presented a narrative to its readership that downplayed Israeli suffering and focused little on Hamas atrocities. The study was conducted independently by Edieal Pinker, a professor and deputy dean at the Yale School of Management, and published in SSRN, a journal for research papers that have not yet undergone peer review. 'Little mention is made of Israeli casualties post-October 7 or of Palestinian acts of violence post-October 7, even as Israel and Hamas were locked in intensive combat over the eight months of the study period,' the study said, according to a Times of Israel summary. 91 percent of the articles published by the Times on the conflict did not mention Israeli casualties sustained after October 7th, glossing over the fact that dozens of civilians were murdered in terror attacks and by Hezbollah and Hamas bombings. 'The reporting does not give the reader a full understanding of how the war is being experienced by Israelis,' the study said. The study also noted that only 10 percent of articles published by the outlet specified that Hamas fighters were killed during battles with Israeli troops, though they mentioned the deaths of Palestinians. There were more than 10 weeks in which no Times articles acknowledged Hamas members fighting Israel, giving readers the impression that all reported Palestinian deaths were of civilians. In a statement to the Times of Israel, the New York Times defended its reporting of the war. A spokesman from the outlet claimed that the newsppaer had 'covered this war with more rigor than virtually any other U.S. news organization, reporting on the conflict from all angles,' claiming it had published reports on 'previously unknown details about the atrocities committed by Hamas' and the 'ferocious military campaign led by the Israeli government.' The newspaper also claimed that their 'editors make careful and deliberate choices about every story we publish to ensure our language, framing, prominence and tone remain true to our mission of independent journalism.' Notably, the Times statement did not directly acknowledge or address any of the data-based points around its coverage that were highlighted in the study.

US: All IDF soldiers must withdraw from Lebanon by next week	Israel’s withdrawal remains on the existing timeline, and they did not request an extension,' says Trump administration official. By World Israel News Staff The United States expects Israel to withdraw all of its troops from southern Lebanon by next week, Trump administration officials confirmed on Monday. 'Israel’s withdrawal remains on the existing timeline, and they did not request an extension' for troops to remain in southern Lebanon later than February 18th, U.S. National Security Council Spokesperson Brian Hughes told The Jerusalem Post. In late November, Israel and Lebanon signed a truce, pushed by the Biden administration, which was originally scheduled to end on January 27th. That agreement required the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanese territory by the end of January. Shortly after President Donald Trump was inaugurated in late January, Israel was granted an extension until February 18th, allowing IDF soldiers to remain on Lebanese soil. At the time, Israel said that Lebanon had not held up its end of the bargain, with Hezbollah terrorists remaining south of the Litani River and the Lebanese Army failing to deploy en masse to the region and root out Hezbollah operatives, which constitute a violation of the ceasefire. But although displaced residents of northern Israel have still not been able to return home due to the ongoing threat from Hezbollah, Washington still expects Israel to withdraw by the February deadline. Channel 12 News reported on Monday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked Trump to permit Israeli troops to remain at a number critical strategic posts in southern Lebanon until further notice. Netanyahu is reportedly arguing that the Lebanese Army is not able to stop Hezbollah from regrouping in the area, and that the terror group will once again resume positions directly adjacent to the Israeli border when Israeli troops are withdrawn. According to the report, Israel wants to station soldiers at five locations near the border, within Lebanese territory, creating a buffer zone that will protect residents of northern Israel.

Trump issues ultimatum to Hamas with deadline to release all host...	Trump's remarks were made shortly after Hamas revealed that the planned release of hostages scheduled for February 15 had been suspended indefinitely due to what it described as an Israeli 'violation' of the ceasefire terms. By World Israel News On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump issued a strong warning to Hamas, stating that the ceasefire agreement should be canceled if all hostages held in Gaza are not released by noon on Saturday. 'If all the Gaza hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12:00 p.m., I would say cancel the ceasefire. Let all hell break loose,' Trump said, adding, 'Israel can override it.' Trump's remarks were made shortly after Hamas posted an announcement on its Telegram account, revealing that the planned release of hostages scheduled for February 15 had been suspended indefinitely due to what it described as an Israeli 'violation' of the ceasefire terms. Following the announcement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held consultations with top security officials and rescheduled a cabinet meeting originally set for Tuesday evening to take place on Tuesday morning instead. In its statement, Hamas described the delay in releasing hostages as a 'warning' to Israel and mediating nations, aiming to pressure Israel into strict adherence to the ceasefire agreement. The terror group accused Israel of failing to fulfill key obligations, citing violations such as delays in allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, attacks involving shelling and gunfire, and failure to deliver agreed humanitarian aid. 'Over the last three weeks, the leadership of the resistance has monitored the enemy's violations and non-compliance with the terms of the agreement. From delaying the return of displaced persons to northern Gaza Strip, and attacking them by shelling and shooting in various areas of the Strip, to not bringing aid equipment in all its forms as agreed, while the resistance has fulfilled all its commitments,' a Hamas spokesperson stated. In response, the Israeli government issued a statement: 'The terrorist organization is responsible for the violations. Members of the delegation who returned from Qatar this morning stated that Hamas’s actions jeopardize the continuation of the deal.' Israel’s Defense Minister, Israel Katz, also condemned Hamas’s decision, saying: 'Hamas’s announcement that it will halt the release of Israeli hostages is a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement. I have instructed the IDF to maintain the highest level of readiness for any possible scenario in Gaza and to ensure the defense of communities near the border. We will not allow a return to the reality of October 7th.'

Hamas official threatens: ‘October 7th was just a prelude’	On Monday, Hamas announced it would pause hostage releases, citing alleged 'Israeli violations' of the agreement. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Khaled al-Qa'id, one of the few remaining Hamas leaders, claimed a military victory in Gaza and warned, 'October 7th was just a prelude.' He stated, 'The October 7 attack was merely a prelude to the complete liberation of the entire Land of Israel from Jewish control.' Al-Qa'id declared Hamas’s victory in the Gaza war, saying it was 'made possible by the unity of the Palestinian people with the fighting forces and the resilience of those who remain steadfast on their land, refusing to leave.' He also thanked Iran for supporting Hamas and supplying weapons to the terror group. Al-Qa'id asserted that Palestinians are not afraid of Israel and that Hamas is prepared to fight until 'victory or death.' On Monday, Hamas announced it would pause hostage releases, citing alleged 'Israeli violations' of the agreement. In response, the Israeli government issued a statement: 'The terrorist organization is responsible for the violations. Members of the delegation who returned from Qatar this morning stated that Hamas’s actions jeopardize the continuation of the deal.' On Thursday, Hamas called on Arab countries to reject U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza and take control of the territory during reconstruction. The group also urged Arab nations to convene an emergency summit to counter what it described as Trump’s 'displacement project.' Hamas claimed that Washington’s position on the Gaza Strip signaled a U.S. intention to occupy the territory. 'We do not need any nation to govern the Gaza Strip, and we reject replacing one occupation with another,' the group stated. 'We urge Arab countries to resist pressure from Trump and stand firm in rejecting the displacement plan,' Hamas added. Last week, during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump announced that his administration intends to relocate the entire population of the Gaza Strip to third-party countries. The U.S. would then assume control of the enclave for rehabilitation and reconstruction.

Israel responds to Hamas’s threat to cancel hostage deal	Defense Minister Katz: 'Hamas’s announcement that it will halt the release of Israeli hostages is a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, Israel responded to Hamas’s announcement that it would suspend the hostage release deal, stating that Hamas, not Israel, had violated the agreement. A Hamas spokesman on Monday accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire agreement and claimed that the IDF had targeted Palestinians in Gaza. In response, the Israeli government issued a statement: 'The terrorist organization is responsible for the violations. Members of the delegation who returned from Qatar this morning stated that Hamas’s actions jeopardize the continuation of the deal.' Israel’s Defense Minister, Israel Katz, also condemned Hamas's decision, saying: 'Hamas’s announcement that it will halt the release of Israeli hostages is a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement. I have instructed the IDF to maintain the highest level of readiness for any possible scenario in Gaza and to ensure the defense of communities near the border. We will not allow a return to the reality of October 7th.' Katz referred to an incident on Sunday in which the IDF fired warning shots at a crowd of Gazans who violated the ceasefire agreement by entering the buffer zone and approaching Israel’s border near Kibbutz Nahal Oz. According to media reports, three people were killed in the incident. Following the event, Katz stated: 'Israel’s security stance on Gaza remains firm: Anyone entering the buffer zone does so at their own risk. There will be no tolerance for those who pose a threat to IDF forces, the border region, or nearby communities.' Regarding Hamas's decision to halt hostage releases, the Prime Minister's Office reassured families, saying: 'All hostage families were updated this evening following Hamas’s announcement. They were assured that the State of Israel remains fully committed to the agreement and views any violation of it with utmost seriousness.' Otzma Yehudit Chairman MK Itamar Ben Gvir urged the government to respond to the cancellation of the hostage releases with a full-scale assault on Gaza, 'from the air and the ground,' and to halt all deliveries of humanitarian aid. Ben Gvir declared: 'We must resume the war and destroy them!'

PA plots to compensate terrorists after pretending to cancel ‘pay...	The 'pay-for-slay' program refers to the PA's policy of providing financial support to terrorists who carry out attacks against Israelis. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Although Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas signed a decree on Monday to end the notorious 'pay-for-slay' program, which compensates terrorists, payments are expected to continue from another source. The 'pay-for-slay' program refers to the PA's policy of providing financial support to terrorists who carry out attacks against Israelis. Although Abbas indicated he was ending this program, Wafa reported that the payments are merely being transferred from the Ministry of Social Development to the National Palestinian Economic Empowerment Institution, an entity under PA control. Additionally, families of terrorists will remain eligible for financial aid under the same criteria as needy families. A decision was made to allow Israel to cease its policy of deducting tax funds from payments to terrorists and their families. Hamas condemned the PA’s apparent cancellation of the program, stating, 'We condemn his decision to cancel the payments to the families of the prisoners, the dead, and the wounded, and to abandon the national cause at a time when our people and the resistance forces are working to safeguard the rights of the released prisoners and to ensure their lives.' Before this decision, there was already a downward trend in the payments terrorist families received for attacks. According to research, the Palestinian Authority’s payments under the 'pay-for-slay' program decreased by 30 to 40% in 2024, despite an expected increase. Col. (res.) Adv. Maurice Hirsch, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, identified several factors contributing to this decline. First, bureaucratic difficulties have arisen since Red Cross representatives have been barred from visiting prisons. Second, Hirsch stated, 'The economic pressure on the Palestinian Authority has reached an unprecedented level. According to new data from the Finance Ministry, Israel has deducted approximately NIS 3 billion from PA funds as of November 2024.' A third factor is the ongoing war in Gaza, which has disrupted the transfer of funds and the documentation required to access them.

Isolated, starved, burned, gagged: hostages’ testimony reveals Ha...	The former hostages reported being interrogated and burned, leading one of them to collapse. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The emaciated appearance of the three hostages released on Saturday was a testament to the severe abuses they suffered at the hands of their Hamas captors. Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami, and Eli Sharabi reported being isolated in tunnels, hung upside down, burned, starved, gagged, deprived of daylight, and subjected to psychological torture. They also witnessed similar treatment of other hostages who were slated for release. 'They treated us like animals,' one of the three released hostages said. The former hostages reported being interrogated and burned, leading one of them to collapse. The three men were forced to endure days without food while their captors taunted them and ate in front of them, finally providing only one stale pita to share among several hostages. Hamas captors often put a cloth around their mouths and gagged them, making it seem as though they were going to suffocate them. Sigi Cohen, mother of hostage Eliya Cohen, said that released hostages informed her that her son had been chained and confined to a tunnel, had not seen sunlight during his entire captivity, and was given very little food. They also reported that Cohen had been tortured by being hung by his feet upside down and burned with a metal object. In addition to the torments he endured in captivity, Cohen has an untreated bullet wound that he sustained on October 7th. Hostage Alon Ohel, whose family received information that he was alive, reported that he had also been chained, starved, and was suffering from medical neglect after sustaining a shrapnel wound and a severe eye injury. Ohel's family has released a statement advocating for his liberation. They wrote, 'Tomorrow, Alon will spend his 24th birthday in Hamas captivity. We urge the prime minister, the cabinet, and the Israeli government—time is running out. The second phase of the deal must proceed to bring all the hostages home. It is your moral obligation to do everything possible to save Alon and the others.'

The event marked the first such celebration under Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who took office after Ebrahim Raisi’s death in a helicopter crash in May 2024. By JNS Tens of thousands of Iranians gathered in Tehran on Monday to mark the 46th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which led to the overthrow of the U.S.-backed shah and the establishment of Iran’s theocracy, the Associated Press reported. The event occurred amid economic struggles caused by U.S. sanctions and escalating tensions with Washington following President Donald Trump’s return to office and renewed 'maximum pressure' sanctions campaign. Protesters carried anti-American and anti-Israeli banners, with some calling for Israel’s destruction. The rally also showcased military displays, including missile replicas. Iran is celebrating the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. I hope this is their last celebrate. pic.twitter.com/0RHHBR38ZD &mdash; Eli Afriat (@EliAfriatISR) February 10, 2025 Over the past year, Iran launched unprecedented direct missile and drone attacks against Israel. Iran’s Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, also attacked Israel, escalating the conflict. However, Israel and its allies intercepted most of the Iranian strikes, which were followed by Israeli retaliatory attacks that significantly damaged Iran’s air defenses and weapons production sites. The war with Hezbollah ended with a ceasefire in November, while negotiations continue over a three-phase truce with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The event marked the first such celebration under Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who took office after Ebrahim Raisi’s death in a helicopter crash in May 2024. Meanwhile, Trump told The New York Post on Saturday that he favors resolving the Iran nuclear issue diplomatically rather than through military action. However, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday dismissed the idea of talks with the United States, saying, 'Negotiating with such a government should not be done.'

Knesset bill seeks to replace ‘West Bank’ with ‘Judea and Samaria...	West Bank,' although more common in modern parlance, has a recent provenance, having been coined by Jordan, which controlled the area for a short time (1948-1967), in an attempt to erase the area’s historic Jewish connection. By JNS Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday approved a Knesset bill to replace the term 'West Bank' with 'Judea and Samaria' in Israeli government documents. 'Judea and Samaria are an inseparable part of the historic homeland of the Jewish people,' the bill states. 'The most decisive events in our history took place in these regions, where our forefathers, prophets, sages and kings established their capital and kingdom. 'In contrast, the term ‘West Bank,’ which originated in a period of foreign rule, reflects a colonialist perspective that ignores the deep historical connection of the Jewish people to its land,' it adds. Committee chairman Simcha Rothman, who introduced the bill, told JNS: 'Semantics are important because through incorrect terminology, the lie wins. You have to describe reality correctly and tell the truth, and this is the first step to correcting the reality.' 'Judea and Samaria' is an ancient term. Judea derives from the name of the Kingdom of Judah, founded in 934 B.C.E., the source of the term 'Jews.' 'Samaria' comes from the ancient city of Samaria, capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel, an independent realm made up of the Hebrew tribes of Reuben, Simeon, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Manasseh and Ephraim; now known as the 10 Lost Tribes, who were taken into captivity by Assyria around 720 BCE. 'West Bank,' although more common in modern parlance, has a recent provenance, having been coined by Jordan, which controlled the area for a short time (1948-1967), in an attempt to erase the area’s historic Jewish connection. The Romans had an identical purpose when in 135 BCE, after defeating the Second Jewish Revolt, they renamed the Roman province of Judaea (an area larger than present day Judea) 'Syria Palaestina' (from which the modern term 'Palestine' comes). They wanted to sever the Jewish connection to the land. Palaestina referenced the Philistines, a people who lived along the coast but had disappeared by the 6th century BCE. 'As chairman of the Constitution Committee, we often get laws that replace terms with more ‘correct’ terms, and I thought that instead of chasing the culture of political correctness, it was time for us to chase after [our own history] for once,' Rothman told JNS. His timing was also influenced by the change in administration in the United States. The 'new administration and the new Congress [are] committed to the historical truth, that the Land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel,' he said. He noted parallel legislative efforts in the United States. U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) have both introduced bills requiring 'all official U.S. documents and materials to use the historically accurate term ‘Judea and Samaria’ instead of the ‘West Bank.'' On Feb. 29, Tenney, in a statement on her website announcing her bill, said, 'The Israeli people have an undeniable and indisputable historical and legal claim over Judea and Samaria.' Cotton, announcing his bill on Feb. 4, said, 'The Jewish people’s legal and historic rights to Judea and Samaria goes back thousands of years. The U.S. should stop using the politically charged term West Bank to refer to the biblical heartland of Israel.' There has been some debate in the coalition about Rothman’s bill. In Sunday’s committee discussion, Shlomo Karhi of the Likud Party, who serves as Communications Minister, suggested that it would be better for the coalition to focus on sovereignty rather than semantics. 'It’s dealing with something that we intend to solve in a completely different way,' said Karhi, according to Kan News. Rothman told JNS however that the difference of opinion wouldn’t affect the bill’s passage. 'Even Karhi’s words did not come as an opposition to the law, but as a statement and a hope, which I myself join, that sovereignty will soon be applied and this law, like other laws that I am promoting myself, together with my colleagues in the Land of Israel Lobby, will become redundant,' he said. Rothman said that he 'definitely' expects the bill to pass.

Trump says no right of return for Palestinians in Gaza under his ...	It comes as he has ramped up pressure on Arab states, especially U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt, to take in Palestinians from Gaza. By The Associated Press President Donald Trump said Palestinians in Gaza would not have a right to return under his plan for U.S. 'ownership' of the war-torn territory, contradicting other officials in his administration who have sought to argue Trump was only calling for the temporary relocation of its population. Less than a week after he floated his plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and turn it in 'the Riviera of the Middle East,' Trump, in an interview with FOX News' Bret Baier that was set to air on Monday, said 'No, they wouldn’t' when asked if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory. It comes as he has ramped up pressure on Arab states, especially U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt, to take in Palestinians from Gaza. 'We’ll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,' Trump said. 'In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land. No big money spent.' Arab nations have sharply criticized the Trump proposal, and Trump’s latest words were released a day before he is set to host Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday. After Trump's initial comments last week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Marco Rubio respectfully insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza 'temporarily' and for an 'interim' period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordinance and reconstruction. Trump last week didn't rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure the territory but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of Gaza, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan.

Anti-Trump think tanks rake in millions from taxpayers for ‘virtu...	Republicans have criticized both think tanks over their central roles in what’s been dubbed the 'censorship-industrial complex,' a network of university and think tank researchers that worked closely with federal agencies to censor content on social media. By Chuck Ross, The Washington Free Beacon Federal agencies have awarded nearly $50 million over the past four years to the Aspen Institute and the Atlantic Council—well-funded liberal think tanks which between them boast 50 donors who have given them at least $1 million—for projects that include a $6 million program to provide 'virtual exchanges' for students in the Middle East, and $300,000 to host a conference to empower women in Saudi Arabia. The grants are but two examples of the taxpayer funds that flow to the country’s biggest think tanks. The State Department, USAID, and Department of Defense have awarded $15.3 million in grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to the Atlantic Council since 2021, and $32.6 million to the Aspen Institute over the same span, according to federal spending records. Taxpayer support for two deep-pocketed institutions could draw fresh scrutiny as the Trump administration—largely through the Department of Government Efficiency, the government unit led by Elon Musk—is scouring the federal government’s books for signs of fraud and wasteful spending. Trump this week moved to shut down USAID, an independent agency that has long worked with the State Department, over its funding for foreign aid programs deemed to be wasteful and nonessential. The Aspen Institute and the Atlantic Council, among the largest think tank recipients of taxpayer funding, have received tens of millions of dollars in donations from an impressive roster of corporations, tech billionaires, philanthropies, foreign companies, and governments. In 2023 alone, the Atlantic Council received 12 donations of at least $1 million each from Meta, Goldman Sachs, the government of the United Arab Emirates, and the Rockefeller Foundation, according to its donor list. The Aspen Institute disclosed that 38 donors gave at least $1 million in 2023, including Walmart, Google, the Ford Foundation, and the philanthropies of billionaires Bill Gates and Mike Bloomberg. Both organizations could present ripe targets for the administration’s cost-cutting measures, for not just their sizable warchests, but also their hostilities towards President Donald Trump. 'There is absolutely no reason that these research projects at the Atlantic Council and Aspen Institute should have even been considered for a government grant,' said Parker Thayer, an investigator at Capital Research Center, a watchdog group that recently launched the DOGE Files to track federal spending. 'Not only are the projects plainly ridiculous wastes of taxpayer money, but both organization have more than a few mega-donors to be getting along with.' Like many Beltway think tanks, the Aspen Institute and the Atlantic Council have been highly critical of Trump’s policies, both domestic and foreign. Aspen Institute president Dan Porterfield said Trump 'fomented' the 'deadly insurrection' at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Katie Couric, the former TV journalist and co-chair of Aspen Institute’s Commission on Information Disorder, has called Trump a 'fascist' and compared a Trump campaign rally at Madison Square Garden last year to a 'Nazi event.' Republicans have criticized both think tanks over their central roles in what’s been dubbed the 'censorship-industrial complex,' a network of university and think tank researchers that worked closely with federal agencies to censor content on social media. In September 2020, the Aspen Institute organized a 'tabletop' exercise with journalists from the New York Times, and Washington Post, and executives from Facebook and Twitter to draft a plan for how to respond to a hypothetical scenario in which Russia leaked documents stolen from Hunter Biden, according to documents uncovered by reporter Michael Shellenberger. Many of the participants—most notably Twitter—censored an accurate New York Post story about Biden’s laptop in Oct. 2020. The Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab is led by Graham Brookie, who served on the National Security Council in the Obama administration. In October 2020, Brookie claimed Trump’s 'entire strategy' in the campaign that year was 'based on process disinformation in this election.' Days later, Brookie dismissed reports of Hunter Biden’s laptop as 'unverified misinfo.' He cheered Twitter’s ban of Trump’s account and 'influencers of the far right' after the Jan. 6 Capitol riots as a 'welcome' decision. The State Department awarded the DFRLab a $64,000 grant in September to host two workshops at the U.S. embassy in Vienna on 'countering foreign information manipulation and interference,' and $250,000 the same month for a project to counter disinformation in Moldova, according to spending records. Other grants to the think tanks could land in the cost-cutters’ crosshairs. On Jan. 1, the State Department gave the Atlantic Council $500,000 for a project slated to run through Oct. 2026, to 'promote responsible trade' in the western Balkans—a region that includes Serbia and Albania—in order to 'support the region’s alignment with a Euro-Atlantic path.' The State Department’s $6 million contract with the Aspen Institute in September will help fund an online exchange program with students and young people in North Africa and the Middle East, to teach them about 'civic engagement,' 'climate change and sustainability,' and other topics. The program involves the use of recorded messages exchanged between students in different countries. In 2021, USAID struck a five-year, $9 million agreement with the Aspen Institute to 'promote investment in Guatemalan entrepreneurs and innovators.' Aspen selected one program participant that will help 'rural communities increase investment capability and access new markets for specialty mushroom, honey, and coffee products.' In many cases, American taxpayers are funding programs that involve the think tanks’ major foreign donors. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—where the Atlantic Council held State Department-funded women’s empowerment conferences—are some of the think tank’s biggest donors. The Saudi-owned Aramco Americas and King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center donated $400,000 to the Atlantic Council in 2023, and the Emirates gave $1.85 million the same year. The State Department gave $40,000 to the Atlantic Council last year for a study and presentation on the threats posed by Russia’s 'shadow fleet' to Denmark. The Danish embassy donated at least $100,000 to the Atlantic Council in 2023. A spokesperson for the Atlantic Council said the State Department has paused funding for a small number of its projects regarding Chinese and Russian influence in response to Trump's executive order to reevaluate foreign aid spending. 'If these sorts of programs are discontinued, the biggest beneficiaries will be America’s adversaries, who are eager to expand their influence in key regions,' the spokesperson said. 'However, the vast majority of our work continues as planned, and we remain committed to delivering on our mission of galvanizing U.S. leadership and engagement in the world, in partnership with allies and partners, to shape solutions to global challenges. The Aspen Institute did not respond to a request for comment.

Digital warfare ‘has reached every home in Israel’ says cyber saf...	Fraud and online scams comprised 17.6% of total helpline reports, followed by cases of sexual harassment at 11.5%. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli Internet Association reported a sharp rise in cyber incidents targeting Israeli citizens in its annual report, released on Monday. The report, based on the activities of the Association’s Safe Internet Helpline, noted unprecedented levels of cyberattacks, fraud and breached social media accounts. 'The war in the digital arena and on the networks has reached every home in Israel,' the report said. Data from the report showed that 45% of all calls to the helpline this year concerned cyber-related issues, a significant increase from 36% last year. Among the most frequent reports were incidents involving hacking into social media accounts, which accounted for 27% of all calls. A notable shift has occurred in the platforms most frequently reported for fraud and cyberattacks. For the first time, WhatsApp has taken the top spot, with 21.7% of complaints directed at the messaging platform. Facebook, which previously held the leading position, followed closely with 19% of complaints. Instagram ranked third with 15.6% of reports. Complaints related to Telegram have also increased sharply, reaching 4.1% of total reports. In the Arab sector, TikTok has emerged as a major concern, with 15% of complaints from that community directed at the platform. The helpline recorded approximately 1,100 calls related to hacking and account takeovers this year, representing a 20% increase compared to the previous year. Fraud and online scams comprised 17.6% of total reports, followed by cases of sexual harassment at 11.5%. Impersonation and privacy violations accounted for 10.9% of complaints, while reports of false and misleading content about the war made up 10.6%. The war has played a role in the escalation of cyber threats, with digital attacks and harassment becoming more prevalent across various online platforms. The Israeli Internet Association has taken steps to combat harmful online content by submitting hundreds of removal requests to digital platforms. Facebook received the highest number of requests, with 322 submissions, and responded positively to 98% of them. TikTok, which received 137 requests, removed 95% of the reported content. The association has successfully facilitated the removal of offensive content in 94% of all cases reported by users. 'This is further evidence that the war has reached the doorsteps of all citizens of the country through the digital arena,' said Edan Ring, the Association’s Vice President of community and social affairs. 'Attempts to attack and harass citizens on the cyber front have grown by tens of percent in the past year. The Israeli Internet Association has succeeded in removing offensive content on the leading platforms in 94% of the requests and continues to help citizens report and remove offensive content. But the first line of defense against attacks must be the citizens themselves – by increasing protective measures such as two-step verification and passwords, reporting directly to the platforms and the helpline, and increasing vigilance and caution in cyberspace as well,' Ring added.

Hamas accuses Israel of ceasefire violations and says it will del...	The next exchange was scheduled for Saturday, releasing three Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. By The Associated Press A Hamas spokesman on Monday accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement with the group, including targeting Palestinians in Gaza with airstrikes, and said that next Saturday's hostage release would be delayed. A Hamas spokesperson said Monday that the group will delay the next hostage release after accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement. Israel and Hamas are in the midst of a six-week ceasefire during which Hamas is releasing dozens of the hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The sides have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire went into effect last month, freeing 21 hostages and over 730 prisoners. The next exchange was scheduled for Saturday, releasing three Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for Hamas’ military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, accused Israel on Monday of systematically violating the ceasefire agreement over the past three weeks, and said Saturday's release would be delayed. 'The resistance leadership has closely monitored the enemy’s violations and its failure to uphold the terms of the agreement,' Abu Ubaida said. 'This includes delays in allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, targeting them with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas of the Strip, and failing to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.'

Trump: US will be ‘buying and owning’ Gaza	US might allow Middle Eastern allies to develop parts of Gaza Strip, says Trump, but America will 'own it,' and ensure Hamas 'doesn't move back.' By World Israel News Staff The United States will be 'buying' and 'owning' the Gaza Strip, President Donald Trump said over the weekend, emphasizing that while America's Middle Eastern allies could play a role in Gaza's rehabilitation and reconstruction, the U.S. would retain ownership of the territory. Trump made the comments while speaking with reporters on board Air Force One on Sunday, en route to New Orleans ahead of the Super Bowl. The president said his administration is 'in no rush' to implement his plan, but doubled-down on his previous claims that the U.S. will 'own' Gaza. 'I’m committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it, other people may do it, through our auspices,' Trump said, adding that the U.S. would ensure Hamas does not attempt to return to the coastal enclave. 'We’re committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn’t move back.' 'Think of it as a big real estate site, and the United States is going to own it, and will slowly, very slowly, we’re in no rush, in development. We're going to bring stability to the Middle East.' The president said that in its present condition, Gaza was a 'demolition site.' 'It'll be reclaimed. It'll be leveled out, fixed up. There won't be anybody there. Hamas won’t be there. We'll be building through other of the very rich countries in the Middle East, they'll be building some beautiful sites for the people, the Palestinians, to live in. They'll be living in harmony and peace, relatively, for the first time in hundreds of years.' Trump said the plan was ensure the safety of Palestinian civilians, and suggested he may be open to permitting some to move to the United States. 'We’re gonna take care of the Palestinians and make sure… they’re not murdered.'

KLM and Ryanair return to Israel with budget-friendly fares	As for North American passengers, United Airlines announced it will resume flying to Israel starting March 15, while Delta Airlines will resume service from New York-JFK to Tel Aviv on April 1. By Jewish Breaking News The summer of 2025 will bring more than just heat to Israel, as European aviation giants make their long-awaited return to Ben Gurion Airport with fares that seem almost too good to be true. Both Ryanair and KLM made significant announcements on Sunday regarding their return to Israeli skies post-Oct. 7. For Israeli travelers itching to explore Europe, Ryanair’s return comes with an enticing array of 23 destinations. Italy takes center stage with seven different routes, while those dreaming of Greek getaways can choose between Athens, Thessaloniki, and, starting in June, the charming coastal city of Chania. German-bound passengers haven’t been forgotten either, with flights to Berlin, Baden-Baden, and Memmingen all on the roster. A quick hop to Paphos, Cyprus, will set travelers back just €37 one-way, while those looking to venture further can reach Bucharest for €45, Vienna for €46, Budapest for €48, or Malta for a mere €50. Round-trip deals are equally attractive, with April flights to Rome available for €140, Berlin for €150, and Athens for €160. However, these introductory prices are expected to shift with demand and season. Meanwhile, KLM’s evening departures from Amsterdam at 9:10 PM, arriving in Tel Aviv in the early hours, and return flights leaving at 4:45 AM, offer more than just a direct link to the Netherlands. The Dutch carrier’s network opens up connections to 270 destinations through its Schiphol airport hub, which will significantly expand travel options for Israeli passengers. As for North American passengers, United Airlines announced it will resume flying to Israel starting March 15, while Delta Airlines will resume service from New York-JFK to Tel Aviv on April 1.

At USAID, funding for terror-tied groups and internal hostility t...	Under Samantha Power, former president Joe Biden's pick to run USAID, agency officials fought pro-Israel policymaking at the State Department, often urging their colleagues at Foggy Bottom to pare down statements that praised the Jewish state. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon As the Trump administration works to shutter the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), current and former U.S. officials who worked closely with the embattled aid group say they watched for years as it funneled millions of dollars to anti-Israel advocacy groups and entities linked to terrorism. That funding caused internal friction across multiple administrations, according to those who spoke with the Washington Free Beacon. In some cases, USAID fought to conceal how taxpayer funds were spent. And when it came to Israel, officials recalled battling USAID over funding for groups that worked to undermine the Jewish state or maintained ties to terror organizations. 'For those who believe in a strong U.S.-Israel relationship, elements of USAID have been problematic for years,' said one former State Department official who worked with USAID during the Biden administration. 'There was even a lack of embarrassment among some USAID staffers about being associated with terrorist organizations.' Some of the terror-tied funding initiatives are publicly known. In November 2022, for instance, USAID awarded $100,000 to a Palestinian activist group whose leaders hailed the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a designated terror group. Just six days before Hamas's Oct. 7 assault on Israel, USAID handed $900,000 'to a terror charity in Gaza involved with the son of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.' USAID's hostilities toward the Jewish state, however, ran deeper than the agency's grantmaking. Under Samantha Power, former president Joe Biden's pick to run USAID, agency officials fought pro-Israel policymaking at the State Department, often urging their colleagues at Foggy Bottom to pare down statements that praised the Jewish state, former officials said. In 2021, during a period of conflict with Hamas, Power herself refused to meet with Israel's ambassador unless Israel reached a ceasefire with the Iran-backed terror group. The decision put Power at odds with the White House National Security Council, which had signed off on the meeting, emails obtained by the Free Beacon show. Years later, in September, Power's USAID accused Israel of deliberately blocking Gazan aid deliveries, which Hamas is known to steal for its own use and for black market sales that fund its terror activities. USAID staffers went as far as to urge the Biden State Department to end military aid to Israel. Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken rejected the request. 'They weren't even in line with some of the Biden administration's policies,' the State Department official who worked under Biden and Blinken told the Free Beacon. 'It's more than just problematic grants to anti-Israel organizations. It's also their role in the internal approval processes and statements within the administration. There's an entire bureaucratic process they're a part of. They carry out their obstructionist ideology on that front as well.' The rogue nature of USAID under Power has motivated the Trump administration's push to dismantle the agency. During his recent trip to El Salvador, Secretary of State Marco Rubio described a longstanding 'frustration' with the agency, which he called 'completely unresponsive.' The 'level of insubordination,' Rubio said, 'makes it impossible to conduct a sort of mature and serious review that I think foreign aid writ large should have.' Federal investigations lend credence to that assessment. A January memo from Inspector General Paul Martin, for example, noted that the agency 'does not maintain a comprehensive internal database of subawardees.' In other words, the foreign entities that work with a primary grantee on a USAID project often go unreported, impeding the ability of agency investigators to vet 'fraud allegations,' according to the memo. Such allegations often include the diversion of taxpayer-funded aid to terrorist organizations. In a November report, for example, Martin 'identified deliberate interference and efforts to divert humanitarian assistance' by foreign terrorist organizations, including 'systemic coercion of aid workers by FTOs' and 'FTO influence over beneficiary selection.' Those diversion efforts are particularly pronounced in Hamas-controlled Gaza. A February report from the Middle East Forum think tank found that USAID had awarded 'millions of federal dollars' to 'organizations directly in Gaza controlled by Hamas.' In one Biden-era case, USAID funded an 'educational and community center in Gaza' controlled by a local group called the Unlimited Friends Association. The association openly collaborated with Hamas, inviting the terror group's officials to its office and boasting of U.S.-funded projects in Hamas-controlled newspapers. In 2021, its director called for Jerusalem to be cleansed 'from the impurity of the Jews.' A separate report, released in January by Israeli research organization NGO Monitor, outlined millions in USAID funding for two nonprofits—Mercy Corps and American Near East Refugee Aid—that 'have closely coordinated with a Gaza-based ministry, run by a senior Hamas official identified by the U.S. Treasury Department as previously responsible for part of Hamas’ smuggling operation.' When it resumed funding for the Palestinians in 2021, the Biden State Department issued an internal warning that there was a 'high risk' Hamas would steal U.S. aid. But information about terror-tied grant recipients in Gaza and elsewhere came mostly from watchdog groups. When members of Congress pressed USAID on those grants, they were often obstructed. In a letter sent to Rubio last week, Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa) detailed USAID's 'willful sabotage of congressional oversight.' The agency, she wrote, falsely claimed that certain grants were classified in a 'desperate attempt to limit congressional oversight of public information.' Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) described similar interactions with USAID staffers. In some cases, he told the Free Beacon, USAID 'refused to disclose what groups were getting money and gave tens of millions in American cash to be distributed without American supervision.' 'Before and after Oct. 7, USAID flowed uncountable hundreds of millions of dollars toward Hamas that enabled it to launch the attack and keep battling Israel afterwards,' Cruz said. 'The full story of USAID funding Hamas is vast and much of it was done in secret.' U.S. officials involved in foreign policy emphasized in interviews with the Free Beacon that, despite its many issues, USAID does fund essential work providing medicine and other lifesaving aid. Rubio has made similar statements, expressing his desire to continue funding programs 'providing food or medicine or anything that is saving lives and is immediate and urgent.' Over time, however, 'more and more money flowed to groups and organizations whose work is contrary to the interests of the United States,' one official who has worked closely with USAID across multiple administrations told the Free Beacon. 'How bad it got is finally coming to light and there is finally transparency.' The Trump administration plans to scale back the agency by dissolving it and placing its core functions within the State Department, where roughly 600 current USAID staffers would work. The agency employed some 10,000 staffers when President Donald Trump took office last month. The overwhelming majority of those staffers were set to go on leave by midnight Saturday. A federal judge blocked the action until Feb. 14, though the decision is temporary and the case is expected to go to the Supreme Court. Democratic lawmakers have vehemently opposed the cuts, arguing that they endanger millions of vulnerable people across the globe. 'People can quibble about this or that,' the current U.S. official said of the Democratic attention surrounding USAID. 'But let's not make the perfect the enemy of the good. This is long overdue.'

‘Fake-Christian Jew-Hatred’ – Evangelical leader urges Trump to r...	Evangelical Christian leader Laurie Cardoza-Moore criticizes President Trump for posing with populist pundit Tucker Carlson, calls on White House to distance itself from those accused of antisemitism on the far-right. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News An Evangelical Christian leader and Republican activist chided the Trump administration Monday, over President Donald Trump's meeting with right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson. Over the weekend, photographs were circulated showing Trump alongside Department of Government Efficiency administrator Elon Musk and Carlson at the White House. In a statement issued Monday by the Tennessee-based Evangelical Christian group Proclaiming Justice to the Nations, the group's president and founder Laurie Cardoza-Moore, accused Carlson of antisemitism, and called on the Trump administration to distance itself from both Carlson and Candace Owens. Owens, a 35-year-old online commentator, has come under fire over her promotion of conspiracy theories and antisemitic canards, including blaming Jews for the death of pop star Michael Jackson. 'I have been inundated with calls from concerned Jews and Christians after Carlson was pictured, wearing an oversized MAGA hat, with President Trump and Elon Musk,' Cardoza-Moore said Monday. 'We the People elected President Trump, with an overwhelming majority and with a referendum, to stand with Israel and our Jewish brethren against the rise of antisemitism, anti-Israelism and anti-Zionism.' Cardoza-Moore lauded Trump's policies vis-a-vis Israel and castigated the rise of antisemitism during the Biden presidency, but expressed concern over Trump's embrace of Carlson. 'Under the Biden Administration, his policies incited violence against our Jewish communities on higher-ed and K-12 campuses, in synagogues, and places of worship.' 'Our 47th President is without any doubt Israel’s greatest friend in the White House ever, but Tucker Carlson’s anti-Semitism is appalling,' continued Cardoza-Moore, whose syndicated Focus on Israel television show reaches billions of viewers worldwide. 'Following the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, Tucker has chosen to platform Holocaust revisionists, Jew haters and fake Christian leaders on the Palestinian Authority payroll,' Cardoza-Moore said, referencing Carlson's interview with podcaster Darryl Cooper and Carlson's April 2024 interview with Munther Isaac. During his interview with Carlson, Cooper downplayed Hitler's role in the Second World War, painting Winston Churchill as the conflict's primary villain. Isaac, a Lutheran pastor from Bethlehem and ardent Palestinian nationalist, had praised the October 7th invasion of Israel prior to his appearance on Carlson's show. 'He peddles in conspiracy theories against God’s Chosen,' Cardoza-Moore said of Carlson. 'He libels the Israel Defense Forces as deliberately targeting civilians – with no basis whatsoever,' she added. Cardoza-Moore called on Trump to keep both Carlson and Owens out of the White House, calling the two 'false prophets.' 'Tucker Carlson should not be allowed anywhere near the White House. Carlson’s positions on Jews are demonic and in violation of the 9th Commandment, bearing false witness against your neighbor. America was founded upon Judeo-Christian values which have made us what we are today. We can put America First and Make America Great Again without false prophets like Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens.'

Gaza hostage’s father credits Trump with daughter’s freedom	The president’s pressure even before his inauguration was what led to the hostage deal, Eitan Gonen wrote. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Romi Gonen’s father gave full credit to U.S. President Donald Trump for his daughter’s freedom and asked him to continue his efforts so that all the remaining hostages come home as well, in an op-ed he wrote in The New York Post Saturday. 'The person who made seeing my daughter possible, after so many months of despair and failed negotiations, was President Donald Trump,' Eitan Gonen averred. 'When he set a Jan. 20 deadline for the deal, it applied the necessary pressure, setting in motion the events that would bring Romi home,' he continued, adding that he would be 'honored' to one day shake the president’s hand 'and express my gratitude for his role in reuniting our family.' Gonen then begged the president to continue his efforts for those still in Hamas’ and other terror groups’ hands in Gaza. 'For the 79 hostages still in captivity as of Friday, including dozens who aren’t even part of the current phase of negotiations, President Trump is their only hope,' he continued. 'Only he could help other families experience the reunion I had. Only he can make the next stages of the deal possible.' Romi was freed along with Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari on January 19 in the first of six scheduled weekly exchanges of hostages for Palestinian security prisoners during a ceasefire whose negotiations had lasted for months before Trump’s November victory in the American elections. The second stage of the negotiations, for the younger, live, male hostages, including IDF soldiers and foreign nationals, with Hamas demanding more prisoners’ freedom and a complete withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza in return, are beginning now in Qatar. There is tremendous pressure from much of the Israeli public for a deal to be inked, especially after the release Saturday of three hostages, Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy and Eli Sharabi, who were emaciated, very pale and shaky on their legs. Many Jews and non-Jews had the same thoughts when seeing their gaunt frames, and President Trump put it very clearly. 'I watched the hostages come back today,' he said, 'and they looked like Holocaust survivors. They were in horrible condition' and looking '25 years older.' While not going into detail about what he meant, he said repeatedly, 'I don’t know how much longer we are going to take that,' and 'At some point, we’re going to lose our patience.' Holocaust survivors told The Post Sunday that the images of Ben Ami, Levy and Sharabi brought them back to their horrific experiences in the concentration camps. 'It’s a sorry sight to look at, and even sorrier we have to discuss it,' said 97-year-old Aron Krell, who survived several brutal German camps. 'It brings back the memories you try to forget, but you can’t forget.' 'When I saw their pictures coming out of captivity, they looked so emaciated and so sick,' he said. 'And the world doesn’t care. I can’t understand — where is the outrage?' Another nonagenarian survivor who also spoke to the New York paper, Lucy Lipiner, wrote on X, ''The horrible images of the hostages pale and starved that were released yesterday brought me back to a very dark time in my life.' 'I saw almost skeletal men walking,' she added. 'The worst thing about them was the depression that was written on their faces – the hollowed cheeks, sunken-in faces… can you imagine this emotional torture, on top of physical torture?' 'The three men look like they came out from Auschwitz.'

Erdogan accuses US of bowing to ‘Zionist lobby’ on Gaza	Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also rejected the plan earlier on Sunday, calling it historically ignorant. By JNS Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza and rebuild the area, calling it unworthy of discussion and driven by pressure from the 'Zionist lobby.' Gaza, Judea and Samaria and eastern Jerusalem rightfully belong to the Palestinians, he said. 'I would like to state this clearly once: The proposals put forward by the new American administration regarding Gaza with the pressure of the Zionist lobby have nothing worth considering or discussing from our perspective,' Erdogan told reporters at Istanbul Airport before boarding a flight to Malaysia for an official visit. 'These are purely preoccupations with nonsense. No one has the power to remove the people of Gaza from their eternal homeland that has been around for thousands of years,' he continued. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also rejected the plan earlier on Sunday, calling it historically ignorant. 'The displacement of Palestinians is unacceptable,' said Fidan. Ankara has been among Jerusalem’s fiercest critics during the war, cutting trade ties and drawing comparisons between Israel’s actions and those of Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. Erdogan even hinted at military action against the Jewish state. Turkey joins other Arab and Muslim-majority countries in rejecting Trump’s proposal, made during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington last week, that would see the U.S. take control of Gaza, resettle its Palestinian population elsewhere and transform the enclave. On Sunday, Trump said that 'Hamas has been a disaster,' blaming the terrorist group for making Gaza one of the 'most dangerous places in the world.' Despite their statements to the contrary, Arab nations would be open to resettling Gazans elsewhere once they were negotiating directly with him, Trump said during a press gaggle on Air Force One as he headed to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl. 'They never spoke to me. They spoke to other people. When they speak to me, they’re going to take them,' he claimed.

Israel’s largest-ever business delegation heads to India to boost...	Trade between Israel and India continues to grow, with total trade volume reaching approximately $5.01 billion in 2024. By Pesach Benson, TPS Led by Minister of Economy and Industry Nir Barkat, Israel’s largest business delegation of its kind departed on Monday for India. The two-day visit aims to strengthen economic ties between the two nations, expand trade opportunities, and foster technological collaboration. The delegation’s departure marks a new phase in the growing economic relationship between Israel and India. 'The departure of the economic delegation to India is a significant step towards deepening economic ties between the countries, strengthening the Israeli economy through significant growth in exports and lowering the cost of living through expanding imports,' said Barkat. 'At the invitation of Indian Economy Minister Piyush Goyal, we are embarking on a journey that will open new markets, increase trade, and remove barriers for Israeli industry. The combination of Israeli innovation and the vast Indian market constitutes a tremendous growth engine for the Israeli economy, and we are committed to leveraging it for the benefit of the Israeli public and economy,' Barkat said. During the visit, key events include the Israel-India Business Forum, attended by economy ministers and senior government officials, and the 'Bridge to Growth' panel on economic cooperation. Business-to-business meetings will take place, facilitating connections between companies from both countries. Professional tours of innovation and industry hubs, including India Energy Week 2025, will offer insights into India’s growing economic landscape. The delegation will focus on strategic areas, including agriculture and water technologies, cyber and information security, digital health, renewable energy, Industry 4.0, and smart transportation. Israeli companies specializing in these fields will explore opportunities to collaborate with Indian counterparts, leveraging their expertise to contribute to India’s economic growth. 'India is a top-notch strategic destination for Israeli companies, and the current delegation is an exceptional opportunity to expand trade and technology ties between the countries,' said Avi Balashnikov, Chairman of Israel’s Export Institute. Trade between Israel and India continues to grow, with total trade volume reaching approximately $5.01 billion in 2024. Exports from Israel to India amounted to around $2.39 billion, while imports from India to Israel stood at approximately $1.42 billion. Diamond trade between the two countries accounted for an additional $1.2 billion. Key Israeli exports include transportation products, chemicals, medical devices, and agricultural products. Another key topic of discussion will be expanding cooperation to bring professional manpower from India to Israel under fair employment conditions. Strengthening labor market ties could provide solutions to workforce shortages while ensuring mutual economic benefits for both countries. India has enormous potential to become one of Israel’s key trading partners, and advanced Israeli technologies are significant to the needs of the Indian government on its path to growth,' said Dr. Ron Tomer, President of Israel’s Manufacturers Association. 'The delegation is an opportunity for Israeli industrialists to meet Indian businesspeople and government officials, to create business connections, with the aim of turning them into commercial collaborations in the future.'

He also noted that Trump is due to meet with Jordan’s King Abdullah in the coming days, which Jordan’s state news agency has already reported. By Reuters and The Algemeiner Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on Sunday that US President Donald Trump was set to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and possibly Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, although he gave no dates for the talks. The comments, delivered in an interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, came in response to a question about Trump’s recently unveiled proposal to take over and redevelop the Gaza Strip. Herzog did not say when or where the meetings would take place, nor did he discuss their potential content. He also noted that Trump is due to meet with Jordan’s King Abdullah in the coming days, which Jordan’s state news agency has already reported. 'President Trump is due to meet with major, major Arab leaders, first and foremost the king of Jordan and the president of Egypt and I think also the crown prince of Saudi Arabia as well,' Herzog said. 'These are partners that must be listened to, they must be discussed with. We have to honor their feels as well and see how we build a plan that is sustainable for the future,' Herzog said. Saudi Arabia has flatly rejected Trump’s Gaza plan, as have many world leaders. Jordan’s King Abdullah plans to tell Trump during their planned Feb. 11 meeting in Washington that the proposal is a recipe for radicalism that will spread chaos through the Middle East and jeopardize the kingdom’s peace with Israel, Reuters reported earlier this week. The White House did not immediately respond to comment. It was not immediately possible to contact officials in Cairo and Riyadh.

Israel hits Syria-Lebanon arms smuggling tunnel	Additionally, the IAF struck Hezbollah sites in Lebanon containing munitions and rocket launchers that posed an 'imminent threat.' By JNS The Israeli Air Force on Sunday carried out a precision strike on a tunnel that according to the Israeli military was used by Hezbollah to smuggle weapons from Syria to Lebanon. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the tunnel in the Beqaa Valley had been struck previously, and was targeted again to prevent its restoration. Additionally, the IAF struck Hezbollah sites in Lebanon containing munitions and rocket launchers that posed an 'imminent threat,' according to the IDF. The IDF emphasized that these targets violated the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire and reaffirmed its commitment to preventing Hezbollah’s rearmament while upholding the truce. Israel on Saturday attacked Hezbollah forces in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon and a facility in southern Syria belonging to the Gaza-based Hamas terrorist organization.

Poll: Americans back Trump’s Israel policies – but few support Ga...	New poll shows few Americans believe Trump is sincere about his Gaza relocation plan while a plurality of Israelis believe Trump's plan could realistically be implemented. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Americans and Israelis are deeply divided over President Donald Trump's Gaza resettlement plan, with a wide gap between the two populations regarding perceptions of the proposal's viability. Last Tuesday, President Trump held a joint press conference in the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During the press conference, Trump announced plans to permanently resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip - officially listed by the Palestinian Authority at over 2.2 million, though some estimates place it as low as 1.7 million - to third-party countries. The plan was panned by leaders across the Arab world, with the foreign ministries of five European powers also distancing themselves from the proposal. The Israeli government, however, and a number of Republican lawmakers hailed the plan, with Prime Minister Netanyahu calling it the 'first good idea' he has heard on the issue of the post-war handling of the Gaza Strip. On Sunday, CBS News published a poll, conducted by YouGov, which surveyed 2,175 American adults from February 5th through the 7th, polling respondents on their views regarding Trump's job performance and specific issues, including his Gaza plan. A majority of 53% said they approve of his job performance thus far, and 59% back his program to deport large numbers of illegal immigrants from the U.S. Even more (64%) say they support deploying troops to the border with Mexico to rein in illegal border crossings. Fifty-four percent said they support Trump's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, but just 13% said they think Trump's plan to assume control over the Gaza Strip is a 'good idea.' Nearly half (47%) said it was a 'bad idea,' while 40% were unsure. In a separate poll, a plurality (47%) of Israelis say Trump's Gaza plan is realistic, compared to (38%) who say it is not, with 15% expressing no opinion. The poll, conducted by the Lazar Research Institute, found that respondents who said they voted for parties in the coalition government were far more likely to say Trump's plan was realistic than voters who backed parties in the opposition, with 78% of coalition voters saying the plan could be implemented, while 58% of opposition voters said it could not be.

Super Bowl halftime show performer detained over Palestinian flag	Neither the NFL nor the entertainment production company knew of the stunt ahead of time. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A backup performer flew a combined Sudanese and Palestinian flag during one of the shows put on at half time at the Super Bowl Sunday before running onto the field and being detained by police. The flags share the same colors, and the word 'Sudan' was written on the Sudanese half while 'Gaza' was written on the Palestinian half, with a heart painted in front of each name. The man, who was later confirmed to be part of the production cast of hundreds dancing while singer Kendrick Lamar performed, pulled it out of his pocket during Lamar’s last song. He held it up while standing on top of a car that was on the stage as part of the set. After waving it briefly, he jumped off the car and off the stage and ran around the sidelines of the football field waving the flag for several seconds before three security guards tackled him. They were joined by several others and dragged him quickly off the field. At no point was the performance stopped because of the stunt. In a statement, the Roc Nation entertainment company that produced the halftime show, which is watched by millions during the long intermission between halves of the championship game, said that the man’s act 'was neither planned nor part of the production and was never in any rehearsal.' The National Football League also said that 'the individual hid the item on his person and unveiled it late in the show' and that 'no one involved with the production was aware of the individual’s intent.' The league praised the security personnel 'for quickly detaining the individual who displayed the flag.' The New Orleans police said in a statement that 'law enforcement is working to determine applicable charges in this incident.' According to AP, one punishment had already been decided upon, as it reported that NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that the protestor would be 'banned for life from all NFL stadiums and events' as a result. By displaying simultaneous support for both Gaza and Sudan, the man was seemingly showing that he backed both the Hamas terror organization in the Strip and the Houthi terrorist group that has taken over most of the North African country in a bloody civil war. The Houthis have showed their support for their fellow Iranian proxy during the 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas by periodically launching missiles at the Jewish state as well as at cargo ships going toward Israel and the Suez Canal, endangering a major international shipping lane.

Next US ambassador to Israel hints at changes of ‘biblical propor...	Former Governor Mike Huckabee, nominated as US Ambassador to Israel, says Hamas 'cannot exist,' lauds Trump's Gaza relocation plan. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump's nominee for the next Ambassador to Israel commended the president's proposed Gaza resettlement plan, and suggested that the president's second term in the White House could lead to geopolitical changes in the Middle East of 'biblical proportions.' On Sunday, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who has been tapped to serve as Trump's envoy to the Jewish state - pending his confirmation by the U.S. Senate - spoke with Fox News' Mario Bartiromo about the future of the Gaza Strip and the Middle East as a whole, following Trump's unveiling last Tuesday of his Gaza plan. 'I’m personally optimistic that we’re going to see something bold,' Huckabee said. 'I will use this term, Maria: I think we will see something of biblical proportion happen with his leadership in the Middle East.' The former governor, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and has in the past expressed opposition to Palestinian statehood, excoriated the Hamas terror organization, citing its record after seizing control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, less than two years after Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005. 'A lot of people forget that Gaza was once a place inhabited by both Jews and Palestinians, until 2005 when Ariel Sharon decided to give it all away,' continued Huckabee. 'He did. They militarily marched 10,000 Jewish people out of Gaza. Turned it into a complete Palestinian state, and the result we saw was [the Hamas-led attack on] Oct. 7th.' 'President Trump did something bold. He looked into the future and said kind of a what if. We don’t know exactly what might happen in Gaza, but here’s what could have happened in Gaza: Gaza could have been Singapore. Instead, Hamas turned it into Haiti. And in fact, maybe worse, far worse than that.' Hamas, Huckabee added, 'is not going to be able to exist,' saying the terror group's dismantling is a 'done deal.' Huckabee went on to laud Trump's Middle East policies during his first term in office, while backing his plan to facilitate mass migration out of the Gaza Strip. 'The only time we’ve had real, significant peace in that region was the four years that Donald Trump was president, and I’m very optimistic that with his leadership, his bold and innovative thinking—he doesn’t think like the other politicians and diplomats have thought, and thank God he doesn’t because we get results.' He throws the box away and says, let’s start with a blank slate and see where this could go. That’s leadership, and that’s what we have with President Trump.'
