Hamas kidnappers will get ‘bullet in the forehead’ – Trump adviso...	Incoming National Security Adviser Mike Walz aims to levy severe consequences against terrorists who kidnap U.S. citizens . By World Israel News Staff President-elect Donald Trump's designated National Security Adviser promised on Sunday that under the incoming administration, terror groups kidnapping Americans would face severe consequences. 'You take an American, you illegally detain them, if you're a nation state or if you're a terrorist, you hold them hostage there is going to be all hell to pay!' Rep. Mike Waltz, who is expected to be confirmed as Trump's National Security Adviser, told conservative commentator Ben Shapiro in a podcast interview published on Sunday. 'There are going to be nothing but consequences for you financially and maybe even a bullet in your damn forehead if you take an American, period!' Waltz noted that the Americans still in Hamas captivity have been held for longer than those during the 1979 Tehran hostage crisis. 'That’s totally unacceptable, and I think writ large, there has never been enough consequences,' Waltz said. 'That’s what we need to be talking about with these people.' Waltz added that the punishment for taking American hostages must be severe, in order to deter future kidnappings by terror groups. 'The next time you think about it… a lot of these groups are going to say, ‘Woah, it’s just not worth it under Donald Trump,'' he said. 'If the bad guys are incentivized to take more [hostages] because they keep getting more, then they’re going to keep doing it. If the bad guys feel nothing but cost and pain for taking our people, they’re going to stop doing it.' There are seven American citizens currently held by Hamas in Gaza, with four of them confirmed to have been murdered on October 7th. Itai Chen and Omer Neutra, two U.S. born IDF soldiers, were killed battling Hamas terrorists during the onslaught. Judith Weinstein Haggai and Gadi Haggai, a married couple with Israeli and American citizenships, were brutally murdered while on a morning walk in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The bodies of Chen, Neutra, Weinstein Haggai and Haggai were kidnapped by the terror group and taken to Gaza. IDF soldier Edan Alexander, who was born in New Jersey, North Carolina-born retiree Keith Siegel, and son of American immigrants Sagui Dekel-Chen are all believed to still be alive, and remain in Hamas captivity.

After Houthi attacks, will Israel directly strike Iran?	Israel may wait until President-elect Donald Trump returns to office before launching a strike on Iranian soil. By World Israel News Staff Israel is weighing the option of directly attacking Iran, after two Houthi ballistic missile strikes in central Israel. While the Houthis are based in Yemen, they are a proxy group of Iran that is supported logistically and financially by Tehran. The hypersonic missiles used by the Houthis last week appear to feature advanced technology for evading detection and interception, which was almost certainly provided by Iran. According to Hebrew-language media reports, Mossad head Dedi Barnea is urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to directly strike Iran as a response to the Houthi attacks. Notably, a series of Israeli strikes on Houthi-controlled ports and oil infrastructure in Yemen last week failed to deter the terror group from attacking Israel. According to Channel 12 News, Tehran is gearing up for an Israeli strike on its soil. The ceasefire with Hezbollah, previous Israeli strike that reportedly destroyed much of Iran's air defenses, and weakening of Shia militia groups in Syria following the ouster of the Assad regime are all factors stoking Iranian concern that an Israeli attack is imminent. Some analysts have speculated that Netanyahu may wait until president-elect Donald Trump returns to office on January 20th before launching a direct attack on Iran. Maj. Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror, a former National Security Advisor of Israel, told Radio103 FM that Israel should focus on attacking Iran, rather than 'wasting resources' on striking the Houthis. 'We need to give high priority to Iran. The damage the Yemenis are doing to us is really not that significant,' Amidror said. 'A country has to choose its wars, and we have a much more important war against Iran,' he added. Amidror said the poverty and lack of infrastructure in Yemen, which has been ravaged by a nearly-decade long war between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis which killed an estimated 400,000 Yemenis, created a unique challenge for Israel. Because the Houthis are already accustomed to 'difficult conditions,' Amirdor said, attacks on their civilian infrastructure are far less effective than in a developed country.

Hamas admits IDF neutralized most of its military capabilities	IDF Arabic Spokesman: 'The East Jabalia Battalion has collapsed,' adding that any claims otherwise are false boasts by Hamas.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas officials admitted to Saudi newspaper A-Sharq Al-Awsat that the IDF has neutralized most of its military capabilities, and absent concrete leadership, groups of terrorists are making their own decisions on the ground. Although terrorists try to inform higher-level Hamas officials of their activities, communication is slow and can often take days or weeks. Among the surviving Hamas leadership are Mohammed Sinwar, the brother of Yahya Sinwar, who is reportedly leading the military wing; Izz ad-Din al-Haddad, responsible for overseeing terrorist activities in northern Gaza; Mohammed Shabana, former commander of the now-dismantled Rafah Brigade; and Tawfiq Abu Naim, head of Hamas' internal security forces. However, Hamas's rhetoric would seem to belie the chaos, and the IDF's Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee said the terror group is making vain boasts to give the impression that it is still functioning. 'Hamas and its minions are spreading news and rumors about fake heroic acts and operations in Jabalia, including claims about the use of knives and explosive belts, to boost the morale of their collapsing members. Don't believe these rumors and lies from the defeated,' Adraee stated. In another post on X, he declared that 'The East Jabalia Battalion has collapsed,' adding that any claims otherwise are false boasts by Hamas. The IDF has destroyed much of Hamas's military infrastructure in Gaza, and the elimination of key figures in the terror organization also prevented them from replenishing supplies. Hamas is releasing videos implying they are still functioning militarily, with one showing a drone fired from Khan Younis that was intercepted in the Negev and another of five terrorists planting explosive devices in shafts. During a situational assessment in Rafah on Wednesday, IDF Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said continued military operations will pressure Hamas to return the 100 hostages remaining in Gaza and create the optimal security situation to allow residents of border communities to return home. 'We are dismantling Hamas and targeting its infrastructure and forces to ensure that there will never be another October 7,' Halevi said. 'We are applying daily pressure on Hamas, driving it into greater distress, to secure the return of the 100 hostages—hopefully alive—and for those who are not, to give them a proper burial in Israel.'

Wizz Air returns as major airlines extend Israel flight ban	The Knesset’s Economic Affairs Committee is also working to amend consumer protection laws regarding flight cancellation compensation. By Jewish Breaking News Major airlines are continuing their flight freeze to Israel despite intense pressure from top aviation officials, while a handful of smaller European carriers trickle back to limited routes. The slow return of international flights has frustrated Israeli aviation officials, who have watched most major carriers extend their cancellations after a northern cease-fire took effect three weeks ago. Among U.S. carriers, American Airlines has pushed back service until September 2025, while United Airlines has scrubbed Israel completely from its schedule. Delta Air Lines and Air Canada have suspended flights through March. Wizz Air represents one of the few bright spots, announcing a restart of service last week between Tel Aviv and Larnaca with four weekly flights. The Hungarian budget carrier is offering promotional fares of 50 euros for the first 1,000 tickets on the route. However, it marks a dramatic reduction from Wizz Air’s pre-war service, which included flights to Milan, Warsaw, Vienna, Budapest, and London. As for other European airlines, only three have returned to Israeli skies. LOT Polish Airlines is operating daily flights to Warsaw with potential future expansion. Air Europa has restored Madrid connections, while Aegean Airlines is serving Athens and Larnaca routes. Meanwhile, the exodus of carriers continues to grow. Air France has suspended service through January 9, while the entire Lufthansa Group – including Swiss, Austrian, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings – won’t return until February. Rome-based ITA Airways is also holding off until February. Budget giants Ryanair and EasyJet have announced they won’t consider returning until April at the earliest, while British Airways has canceled through March. Israel’s Transportation Ministry and Civil Aviation Authority are continuing to press carriers to resume service, but obviously with limited success. 'This is a very slow and gradual, if not disappointing, return,' a senior Israeli aviation official tells Haaretz. 'Every event that takes place is an additional warning sign for the airlines. They aren’t in any hurry to announce their return to Israel; as far as they’re concerned, the war isn’t over even if the northern front is quiet.' The Knesset’s Economic Affairs Committee is also working to amend consumer protection laws regarding flight cancellation compensation. However, ongoing concerns about insurance costs, risk management, and crew accommodations in Israel continue to deter carriers from committing to resumed service.

Inside Israel’s next gen fight to save its heroes	Surgical robots are proving their worth at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where Medtronic’s robotic guidance system removed a bullet lodged in a soldier’s sacrum in just 90 minutes, preventing paralysis and lead poisoning. By Jewish Breaking News Israel’s defensive war in Gaza has been devastating, with 818 soldiers dead, 12,000 in rehabilitation, 40% with limb trauma, and a third of troops battling psychological wounds. But inside Israel’s hospitals, a quiet revolution in combat medicine is taking shape. Designed for amputees haunted by phantom pain, Israeli startup 6Degrees has developed the MyMove system, now employed at Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan. Patients wear lightweight bands and VR headsets, engaging with games where virtual versions of their lost limbs move naturally. Clinical trials show 88% of users report significant pain relief. For IDF soldier Aaron Bours, who lost over three inches of bone in his right leg while attempting to rescue his commanding officer, MyMove has been a game-changer. 'I broke a sweat like I hadn’t done in many months. It’s fun, so the results are that much better,' Bours tells the New York Post. 'We’re a survivalist nation. We have to be because otherwise we’d die.' At Sheba’s 3D Center, surgeons used a precisely designed skull model to reconstruct IDF officer Omri Rosenblit’s facial structure after he was severely injured when a building collapsed on him in Khan Yunis. The technology even helped restore his vision. In another remarkable case, a 3D-printed implant helped reconstruct a shattered IDF canine’s skull. Surgical robots are proving their worth at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where Medtronic’s robotic guidance system removed a bullet lodged in a soldier’s sacrum in just 90 minutes, preventing paralysis and lead poisoning. Meanwhile, Aidoc’s AI-powered medical imaging system is transforming emergency response, demonstrated dramatically when it helped save a 23-year-old Nova massacre survivor by mapping a bullet’s path through her brain in seconds. The psychological toll of war has spurred equally innovative mental health solutions. GenAI-powered platform LIV at Sheba helps overwhelmed psychiatrists by conducting initial patient interviews and gathering clinical data. By the time patients meet with a psychiatrist, LIV’s detailed summaries allow doctors to focus on decision-making rather than lengthy intake sessions. At Tel Aviv University, researchers have developed a self-guided version of trauma intervention, backed by Microsoft Israel R&D engineers. Based on EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), the technology is designed to prevent PTSD from developing after a traumatic event. Even battlefield medicine has seen dramatic advances. Magen David Adom has helped IDF become the first military in the world to implement whole blood transfusions in combat zones, achieving a 93% survival rate for massive trauma cases. New chip-bearing dog tags enable medics to track treatment details from battlefield to hospital bed. Perhaps most surprising is the rise of unconventional treatments like NexoBrid, which uses pineapple stem enzymes to remove dead tissue from severe burns. Recently FDA-approved for pediatric use, the U.S. Department of Defense has invested $15 million in this groundbreaking technology for Israel’s wounded soldiers.

Haifa Airport takes off again after months-long war closure	Beginning January 2, the airline will expand its network with five weekly flights to Athens. By Pesach Benson, TPS After months of being closed by war, Haifa International Airport resumed domestic and international flights on Sunday. 'The return to operations of Haifa Airport is another step back to routine and growth, and to strengthening the northern region,' said Transportation Minister Miri Regev. 'This is a historic moment for Israeli aviation: After 30 years, a new Israeli airline is joining, connecting North to South in the spirit of the ‘Connecting Israel’ vision.' The newly established airline, Air Haifa, inaugurated its services with a maiden flight to Eilat, followed by its first international flight to Larnaca, Cyprus, later in the day. Beginning January 2, the airline will expand its network with five weekly flights to Athens. 'We are very excited to launch operations from Haifa Airport. During this period, it is especially important to strengthen the region and provide the residents of the north with aviation services that they have been waiting for for many years,' said Air Haifa CEO Gonen Ussishkin. The Airports Authority recently completed extensive upgrades to Haifa Airport’s infrastructure, with investments totaling tens of millions of shekels. Renovations included a comprehensive overhaul of the now 1,300-meter runway to meet international safety standards, the installation of biometric screening stations, and enhancements to the passenger terminal. To further improve access, the Transportation Ministry launched a direct 15-minute shuttle service connecting the airport to Israel Railways, the metro, the Haifa cable car, and a planned scenic light rail line to Nazareth. 'The past year was not easy,' said Airports Authority Sharon Kedmi. 'Haifa Airport was forced to suspend its operations for a while. The airport’s return to operations proves once again the resilience of the northern region and its ability to develop and grow, despite all the challenges. I am confident that Air Haifa will lead us to a future in which Haifa will be a significant aviation hub, connecting us all to the wider world and to economic and social prosperity.'

Syria’s new rulers name HTS commander as defense minister	Earlier on Saturday, the ruling General Command named Asaad Hassan al-Shibani as foreign minister, SANA said. By Reuters and The Algemeiner Syria’s new rulers have appointed Murhaf Abu Qasra, a leading figure in the insurgency which toppled Bashar al-Assad, as defense minister in the interim government, an official source said on Saturday. Abu Qasra, who is also known by the nom de guerre Abu Hassan 600, is a senior figure in the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group which led the campaign that ousted Assad this month. He led numerous military operations during Syria’s revolution, the source said. Syria’s de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa discussed 'the form of the military institution in the new Syria' during a meeting with armed factions on Saturday, state news agency SANA reported. Abu Qasra during the meeting sat next to Sharaa, also known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, photos published by SANA showed. Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir said this week that the defense ministry would be restructured using former rebel factions and officers who defected from Assad’s army. Bashir, who formerly led an HTS-affiliated administration in the northwestern province of Idlib, has said he will lead a three-month transitional government. The new administration has not declared plans for what will happen after that. Earlier on Saturday, the ruling General Command named Asaad Hassan al-Shibani as foreign minister, SANA said. A source in the new administration told Reuters that this step 'comes in response to the aspirations of the Syrian people to establish international relations that bring peace and stability.' Shibani, a 37-year-old graduate of Damascus University, previously led the political department of the rebels’ Idlib government, the General Command said. Sharaa’s group was part of al Qaeda until he broke ties in 2016. It had been confined to Idlib for years until going on the offensive in late November, sweeping through the cities of western Syria and into Damascus as the army melted away. Sharaa has met with a number of international envoys this week. He has said his primary focus is on reconstruction and achieving economic development and that he is not interested in engaging in any new conflicts. Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8, forcing Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war and ending his family’s decades-long rule. Washington designated Sharaa a terrorist in 2013, saying al Qaeda in Iraq had tasked him with overthrowing Assad’s rule and establishing Islamic sharia law in Syria. US officials said on Friday that Washington would remove a $10 million bounty on his head. The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, caused one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times and left cities bombed to rubble and the economy hollowed out by global sanctions.

Wreckage of Israeli chopper downed in Yom Kippur War found in Syr...	The families of the six victims of the April 27, 1974, crash were notified, Israel’s Channel 12 News reported on Sunday. By JNS Israeli forces in Syria have found the wreckage of an Israeli Air Force helicopter which crashed during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The remains of the helicopter, which went down due to bad weather conditions during a rescue mission, were uncovered last week on the Syrian side of Mount Hermon. The wreckage was returned to Israel on Saturday, and the families of the six victims of the April 27, 1974, crash were notified, Israel’s Channel 12 News reported on Sunday. Israeli forces took up defensive positions on the Syrian side of Mount Hermon shortly after Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted by rebels on Oct. 8. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel will remain on the Syrian side of the strategic plateau until another arrangement can be found. Israeli officials have described the move as limited and temporary, with the aim of ensuring the security of Israel’s border area. &#xfe0f;CLOSING A CIRCLE IN SYRIA - 50 YEARS LATER: On April 27, 1974, an IAF Super Frelon helicopter was scrambled to evacuate wounded IDF Paratroopers who had been struck by Syrian shellfire on Mount Hermon (the Syrian side).

Iran in midst of energy crisis, despite wealth of gas, crude	Iran needs about 350 million cubic meters of natural gas a day to function, and with overnight winter temperatures in the 30s and 40s Fahrenheit, demand has spiked. By David Isaac, JNS For much of last week, Iran was 'virtually shut down' to conserve energy, with the nation’s leaders offering no solution other than to say sorry, The New York Times reported on Dec. 21. 'We must apologize to the people that we are in a situation where they have to bear the brunt,' Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a live televised address this month. 'We are facing very dire imbalances in gas, electricity, energy, water, money and environment. All of them are at a level that could turn into a crisis,' he said. Power outages started during a heat wave in August and now have become a full-blown crisis. Government offices are shuttered or operating on reduced hours, schools are online-only and factories have lost power, 'bringing manufacturing to a near halt,' the Times reported. This, despite the fact that Iran is awash in natural gas and crude oil. (It ranks second in the world in natural gas reserves and fourth in oil reserves.) Seventy percent of Iran’s energy comes from natural gas, with 90% of Iranians relying on gas for heating and cooking. Most Iranian power plants run on natural gas. Iran needs about 350 million cubic meters of natural gas a day to function. With overnight winter temperatures in the 30s and 40s Fahrenheit, demand has spiked. The government was faced with either cutting gas service to homes, or shutting down power to electric generation plants. The former would cut heat to residents during the cold winter months, so the government chose the latter. 'The policy of the government is to prevent at all costs cutting gas and heat to homes,' Seyed Hamid Hosseini, a member of the Chamber of Commerce’s energy committee, told the Times. 'They are scrambling to manage the crisis and contain the damage because this is like a powder keg that can explode and create unrest across the country.' Seventeen power plants had been taken offline by Dec. 20. The rest are operating on a partial basis. Tavanir, the state power company, said widespread power cuts could last days or weeks. Mehdi Bostanchi, head of the country’s Coordination Council of Industries, told the Times that the situation was catastrophic and industries had never experienced anything like it. He estimated last week’s power cuts could cut manufacturing in Iran by 30% to 50%, amounting to tens of billions of dollars. Smaller and medium factories were hit the hardest, he said. Sanctions, mismanagement, aging infrastructure and wasteful consumption were reasons cited by the Times for the power crisis. It also listed targeted attacks by Israel, noting Israel’s destruction of two Iranian gas pipelines in February. Iranians mainly blame the government. 'The Islamic Republic has set us back centuries and ruined our lives,' said one citizen quoted by Iranian International, an anti-government, London-based news outlet, on Nov. 20. Corruption, mismanagement and foreign wars According to the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), a Washington-based think tank, 'The people know the real cause is the regime’s unending corruption, mismanagement and foreign wars. Thus, the overwhelming majority blames [Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei and his lieutenants.' Iran simply doesn’t produce enough electricity, FDD noted, saying consumption peaks at 17,500 megawatts above production, 'a shortfall equivalent to more than eight Hoover Dams.' The Islamic regime is blaming everyone but itself, sparking further anger among the population. Pezeshkian claimed the blackouts are due to his decision to ban mazut, a type of low-cost fuel used in the Soviet-era, which is highly polluting. But his ban affects only three out of 16 plants that burn the substance. 'Nor does he explain why taking three plants offline would cause such shortages, as Iran has 140 other major power plants,' FDD said. In any case, the government reversed its partial ban on the fuel in a Nov. 17 decision, 'authorizing provinces to use mazut in all power plants and industries,' Iranian International reported. The government also has accused the population of wasteful energy use, sparking even more anger among average Iranians. In November, Mohammad-Jafar Ghaempanah, Pezeshkian’s executive deputy, blamed the public for the shortages and the mazut burning. In September, Vahid Yaminpour, a state television presenter and secretary of the Supreme Council of Youth, called the power cuts a 'positive event' that strengthens the family foundation, Iranian International reported. 'In Lebanon, even in non-war conditions, many people have about four hours of state electricity,' Yaminpour said. 'Be grateful and don’t complain.' His comments met with widespread criticism. Hassanali Taghizadeh, chairman of the Iran Electrical Industry Syndicate, rejected the assertion that domestic use was disproportionately high, saying, 'Don’t blame the people.' One critic said: 'There are donation boxes all over the cities to help the people of Gaza and Lebanon, while the officials of the Islamic Republic don’t care about the Iranian people at all.' Another pointed out that unlike Lebanon, Iran is energy-rich. A third said Iranian officials are unable to provide for their own people and only know how to launch missiles.

Kurds to Netanyahu and Trump: The clock is ticking	Despite decades of oppression, the Kurds have emerged as a vital democratic force in one of the world’s most volatile regions. By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News The Kurdish people, a nation of 45-50 million spread across Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey, have long been stateless. As indigenous people of the Middle East, their struggle for autonomy is rooted in their history, culture, and values. Despite decades of oppression, the Kurds have emerged as a vital democratic force in one of the world’s most volatile regions. Today, a senior Kurdish policy adviser, speaking directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, warns: The clock is ticking. The recent upheaval in Syria, marked by the ousting of President Bashar al-Assad and the subsequent power vacuum, has intensified the challenges faced by the Kurdish population. With various factions vying for control and Turkey escalating its aggression, urgent action is needed to prevent further chaos and ensure regional stability. Who are the Kurds? The Kurds are an indigenous people who have lived in the Middle East for thousands of years. Despite their rich culture and contributions to the region, they have been denied statehood since the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1920 divided their homeland into four parts. This division subjected them to systemic oppression in all four countries, including bans on their language, culture, and political rights. In Syria, the Kurds have established self-governance structures in the northeast, emphasizing inclusivity, gender equality, and secularism. However, these achievements are under threat as Turkey increases military operations, targeting Kurdish civilians and infrastructure. Turkey’s recent offensives, coupled with its support for extremist factions, further destabilize an already volatile region. The current crisis in Syria The ousting of Bashar al-Assad has created a dangerous power vacuum in Syria, leaving the Kurds and other minorities vulnerable. Kurdish regions, which account for 30–35% of Syrian land and 90% of its resources, are critical to the region’s stability. Turkey’s President Erdogan, using NATO resources, continues to launch airstrikes and drone attacks on Kurdish regions. These attacks aim to suppress Kurdish autonomy and undermine their role as a buffer against jihadist groups and the Iranian regime. The Kurds have also been excluded from international discussions about Syria’s future, further marginalizing their contributions to peace and security. Sash, the senior Kurdish adviser, warns: 'Erdogan’s unchecked aggression will lead to catastrophic humanitarian and security crises. If we do not act now, jihadist forces will grow stronger, threatening Israel and the West.' The Kurds, who played a pivotal role in defeating ISIS, now face renewed threats from both jihadists and regional powers. The international community, particularly the United States and Israel, must act to prevent the resurgence of extremism and ensure Kurdish representation in determining Syria’s future. Sen. John Kennedy’s warning to Erdogan As global leaders deliberate on the unfolding crisis, Sen. John Kennedy issued a stern warning to Erdogan this morning: 'Leave the Kurds alone… the Kurds are America’s friends. The people most responsible for destroying ISIS caliphate were the Kurds. We lost less than 20 American lives; our Kurdish friends lost more than 10,000 fighting alongside us. Over 30,000 Kurds were wounded. Without the Kurds, ISIS would still be there.' Kennedy went on to emphasize the alliance between Turkey and NATO, questioning Turkey’s commitment: 'Turkey is supposed to be our friend, Turkey is a member of NATO. Lately, they haven’t been acting like our friend.' He directly addressed Erdogan’s intentions: 'Erdogan, because of his hatred for the Kurds, is going to attack them… Kurds live very peacefully in northeast Syria. Don’t do it. Leave the Kurds alone.' Kennedy concluded with a stark promise: 'If you invade Syria and touch a hair on the head of the Kurds, I’m going to ask this Congress to do something, and our sanctions are not going to help the economy of Turkey. Leave the Kurds alone!' This statement underscores the gravity of the situation and serves as a reminder of the moral and strategic imperative to stand with the Kurds. A critical message for Trump and Netanyahu Speaking under the pseudonym 'Sash' for personal safety, the Kurdish adviser emphasizes the urgency of the moment: • To President Trump: 'President Trump, the Kurdish people have stood as a bulwark against ISIS and extremism in the Middle East. With your support, we defeated ISIS, prevented Iran from gaining more ground, and safeguarded resources in Northeast Syria. But Erdogan’s aggression threatens to undo these achievements. 'We urge you to pressure NATO to stop Turkish airstrikes and drones targeting Kurdish civilians. Force Erdogan to stay within his borders and prevent further destabilization. Recognize Kurdish autonomy and support our democratic values. This is not just a Kurdish victory—it is an American victory for global security.' • To Prime Minister Netanyahu: 'Prime Minister Netanyahu, Erdogan has shown his alignment with Hamas and openly threatens Israel’s sovereignty. During the October 7 terror attacks, Erdogan stood with Hamas, even threatening Jerusalem. His support for jihadist forces in Syria is a direct threat to Israel’s security. 'Kurds and Jews share a unique bond as indigenous peoples of the Middle East. We have never joined the antisemitic campaigns of the region and have stood as natural allies to Israel. It is time for Israel to take a clear stand against Erdogan’s aggression and support Kurdish statehood. Together, we can stabilize the region and counter the rise of extremism.' Why the Kurds matter The Kurds have proven themselves to be invaluable allies to Israel and the West: 1. Democratic values: Kurdish regions are governed by secular principles, with women holding 50% of leadership roles. 2. Defenders against extremism: Kurdish forces were instrumental in defeating ISIS and continue to act as a buffer against Iranian influence and jihadist groups. 3. Natural allies: Kurds and Israelis share historical bonds as two stateless peoples in the Middle East who prioritize peace and democracy. The Kurds' call to action The Kurds are asking for immediate international support: 1. Pressure Turkey to halt attacks: Stop Erdogan’s airstrikes and drones targeting Kurdish civilians. 2. Provide defensive support: Equip Kurdish forces with defense systems to protect their people. 3. Recognize Kurdish aAutonomy: Advocate for Kurdish statehood as a stabilizing force in the Middle East. Sash concludes: 'Helping the Kurds today is not just about justice for our people. It is about securing peace and democracy for the future. Today, the threat is on us. Tomorrow, it could be you.' The recent developments in Syria present both challenges and opportunities. Kurdish contributions to global security and their shared values with Israel and the U.S. make their cause a priority for both Trump and Netanyahu.

Hostage deal talks 90% complete, says Palestinian official	Israel and Hamas have made significant progress towards a ceasefire and hostage deal, says a senior Palestinian official, though several key points remain unresolved, including Israeli control of Egypt-Gaza border. By World Israel News Staff Negotiations in Doha, Qatar aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and a hostage deal are 90% complete, according to a senior Palestinian official who spoke with the BBC. The official, who is involved in the talks, said that several issues remain unresolved, but added that once they are bridged, a deal could be reached within a matter of days. The top issue yet to be resolved is control of the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along the frontier between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. Israel has insisted the IDF retain control over the strategic area, while Hamas has demanded that Israel withdraw from the corridor. The talks have included a proposal for a demilitarized buffer zone several kilometers wide along the Israel-Gaza border. Since Israeli forces entered the Gaza Strip after October 7th, the IDF has cleared out buildings near the Israeli frontier for a potential buffer zone. According to the official, during the first phase of a three-stage ceasefire, Hamas would release female soldiers, with Israel freeing 20 jailed terrorists in exchange for each of the five female soldiers. As part of the deal now under consideration, the official said, Israel would permit the large-scale return of Gazans to the northern Strip, under the oversight of Egypt and Qatar, with some 500 trucks entering the Gaza Strip daily to deliver international aid. In the third stage of the ceasefire, the war between Israel and Hamas would be terminated and the Gaza Strip handed over to a committee of non-partisan technocrats endorsed by various Palestinian factions including Hamas and Fatah. According to a report Sunday by the Egyptian outlet Al-Ghad, Israel is pushing for the release of 11 men during the first stage of a ceasefire. That would bring the number of hostages to be released in the first stage to a total of 34, or more than half of the remaining hostages who have not been confirmed as dying in captivity. Hamas is reportedly demanding 'special consideration' from Israel in selecting additional jailed terrorists to be freed in exchange for the release of the male hostages.

Pope Francis accuses Israel of ‘cruelty’ and slaughtering childre...	Israel's foreign ministry blasts pontiff's accusations against Israel, calling his attacks a 'double standard' against the Jewish state. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Pope Francis accused Israel twice over the weekend of 'cruelty' in the Gaza Strip, and claimed Israeli forces were 'machine-gunning' Arab children in the coastal enclave. On Saturday, Pope Francis gave his annual Christmas address to Vatican department chiefs, during which he condemned an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip which the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claimed killed 25 people. 'Yesterday, children were bombed,' Pope Francis said. 'This is cruelty. This is not war. I wanted to say this because it touches the heart.' A day earlier, Israeli Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli (Likud) ripped the pontiff over a quote attributed to him in a recently published book in which he appeared to accuse Israel of genocide in the Gaza Strip. Last month, Pope Francis issued a clarification regarding his comments, published recently in Hernán Reyes Alcaide’s new book, Hope Never Disappoints. Pilgrims Towards a Better World, in which he called for an investigation into allegations of genocide in Gaza. 'According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,' Pope Francis was quoted as saying. 'We should investigate carefully to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.' Following a wave of criticism, Pope Francis said that Alcaide had taken his comments out of context. The pontiff rekindled the firestorm on Saturday, however, with his fresh allegations against Israel, drawing a sharp retort from the Israeli Foreign Ministry. 'Cruelty is terrorists hiding behind children while trying to murder Israeli children; cruelty is holding 100 hostages for 442 days, including a baby and children, by terrorists and abusing them,' the ministry tweeted. 'Unfortunately, the Pope has chosen to ignore all of this, as well as the fact that Israel’s actions have targeted terrorists who used children as human shields.' The ministry called the Pope's comments 'disappointing' and 'disconnected,' and accused the pontiff of 'singling out' Israel. 'The blame should be directed solely at the terrorists, not at the democracy defending itself against them. Enough with the double standards and the singling out of the Jewish state and its people.' On Sunday, however, the Pope doubled down on his comments, again accusing Israel of 'cruelty' in the Gaza Strip, and intimating that the IDF is intentionally massacring Gazan children. 'And with pain I think of Gaza, of so much cruelty, of the children being machine-gunned, of the bombings of schools and hospitals. What cruelty,' Pope Francis said after the weekly Angelus prayer.

Israel will ‘crush Hezbollah’ if terror group breaks ceasefire – ...	Israeli defense minister vows to 'crush Hezbollah's head' if the terror group fails to withdraw from southern Lebanon or tries to attack Israel in violation of ceasefire. By World Israel News Staff Israel's defense chief vowed Sunday that the IDF would respond harshly if the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group Hezbollah attempts to attack Israel, or refuses to withdraw from southern Lebanon as required by the ceasefire agreement. Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) visited Israeli troops deployed to southern Lebanon on Sunday, and was accompanied by the commander of Division 91, Brigadier General Shai Kalfer, as Israel's top brass prepares security arrangements for the gradual withdrawal of IDF forces from Lebanese territory. Katz held a situational assessment during his visit with division commander Colonel Or Volozhinsky, along with the commanders of Battalion 13 and Battalion 605. On November 27th, the Israeli security cabinet signed a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah, brokered by the U.S. and France, under which Hezbollah agreed to withdraw from the Israeli frontier and move north of the Litani River, in exchange for a gradual withdrawal of IDF forces from Lebanon over a 60-day period. During his visit, Katz said that Israeli forces had devastated Hezbollah, and pledged that if the terror group violates the ceasefire or continues to operate along the Israeli border, the IDF will 'crush' the Shi'ite terror organization. 'We have hit Hezbollah with unprecedented strength. We have defanged the snake, and if Hezbollah does not withdraw beyond the Litani River, or if it attempts to violate the ceasefire agreement, we will crush is head,' Katz warned. 'I came here to the IDF outpost, which overlooks the Shi’ite villages of Maroun al-Ras and Yaron, which posed a significant threat to the communities in the Galilee, to ensure from up close that the IDF's achievements in Lebanon are well-preserved.' 'We will not enable Hezbollah operatives to return to villages in southern Lebanon and re-establish terror infrastructure that threatens Israel's northern border, and we will ensure the IDF's ability to continue to fully enforce the reality on the ground.' 'We will ensure the removal of the threat and the restoration of security to allow the residents of the north to return safely to their homes.'

Samaritan Ten Commandments tablet sells for $5M	The tablet presents a distinctive version of the Ten Commandments, notably omitting the commandment not to take the Lord’s name in vain and including a directive to worship at Mount Gerizim. By JNS A stone tablet bearing the biblical Ten Commandments, which Sotheby’s auction house has declared the oldest known example of its kind, was sold on Wednesday for $5 million at auction. The anonymous buyer has announced intentions to donate the artifact to an Israeli institution. Sotheby’s dates the tablet to approximately 1,500 years ago, during the late Roman-Byzantine era. The artifact, weighing approximately 115 pounds and extending 24 inches in length, features the Ten Commandments carved in ancient Hebrew script. Jacob Kaplan, who discovered the tablet in 1943, reported that it was initially found in 1913 during railroad construction along Israel’s southern coastline. According to Kaplan, the stone had been repurposed as flooring in a residence, with its inscribed surface facing upward. Kaplan, who passed away in 1989, documented his findings in a scientific journal in 1947. The artifact’s ownership history includes several transfers: It passed to an Israeli antiquities dealer in 1995, then to Brooklyn’s Living Torah Museum, before being acquired by collector Mitchell S. Kapel in 2016 for $850,000. Kapel sold the tablet on Wednesday at Sotheby’s New York. The tablet presents a distinctive version of the Ten Commandments, notably omitting the commandment not to take the Lord’s name in vain and including a directive to worship at Mount Gerizim, a location revered by Samaritans in Judea and Samaria. The auction proceeded despite significant expert skepticism regarding the tablet’s authenticity. 'This region’s antiquities market is notorious for forgeries,' noted Brian E. Daniels, director of research and programs at Philadelphia’s Penn Cultural Heritage Center. However, he added, 'There remains the possibility that it is entirely authentic and represents a genuine historic discovery.' Christopher A. Rolston, who heads the Department of Classical and Near Eastern Languages and Cultures at George Washington University, challenged the dating assertion. 'Sotheby’s claim of the Samaritan Ten Commandments inscription being roughly 1,500 years old cannot be verified,' he told The New York Times. 'Without archaeological context or documented discovery, we can’t even confirm who originally found it.' Rolston further questioned the discovery narrative. 'The absence of any 1913 documentation is problematic, particularly since forgers and antiquities dealers commonly fabricate such origin stories to lend credibility to inscriptions. This could well be an invented narrative,' he said. Selby Kiffer, Sotheby’s senior specialist in books and manuscripts, emphasized the stone’s physical deterioration patterns as crucial dating evidence. He particularly noted the significance of the script style, explaining, 'The ancient Hebrew script provides crucial dating evidence, as we have clear historical records of when it ceased to be commonly used.' 'This exceptional price reflects the artifact’s unprecedented historical significance,' remarked Richard Austin, Sotheby’s worldwide head of books and manuscripts. 'To stand in the presence of this tablet is remarkable—it represents a tangible link to the shared foundations of faith and culture that continue to influence our world today.'

Jerusalem residents indicted for spying for Hezbollah during war	Salam is accused of sending photos from Caesarea, while Asili reportedly shared news articles about Israel and its security situation. By Pesach Benson, TPS Two Jerusalem residents were indicted on Sunday for providing information to Hezbollah during the recent war. According to the indictment, Abd al-Salam, 33, and Ta’ar Asili, 35, were in contact with a woman named Dania via a WhatsApp group. Despite realizing she was affiliated with Hezbollah, Salam and Asili continued to share information with her. Salam is accused of sending photos from Caesarea, while Asili reportedly shared news articles about Israel and its security situation. The defendants were also instructed to contact a senior Hezbollah intelligence operative known as 'Al-Hajj.' Asili allegedly purchased a new SIM card for this purpose but refused a request to photograph the Metula area. The indictment further accuses Al-Salam of being photographed with a weapon during a visit to Jenin, an area controlled by a local authority called 'Abu Harb.' He faces additional charges for attempting to carry a weapon without a permit. On Thursday, a Nazareth teen. Muhammad Saadi, 19 was charged with having repeated contact with the Lebanon-based terror group for several years and making several attempts to join its ranks. Saadi is also accused of communicating with Hezbollah’s television station, Al-Manar, providing photos and videos. When Hezbollah began launching daily rocket and drone attacks after Hamas’s October 7 attack, Saadi allegedly transmitted missile impact locations, aircraft movements, and the positioning of Israeli military units.

CAIR sues US State Department over ‘failing to evacuate American ...	CAIR claims that the State Department has run afoul of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, which 'guarantees equal protection for citizens and legal residents abroad under federal law.' By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The Council for America-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a group that purports to advocate for Muslim Americans, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. State Department for 'failing to evacuate American citizens, American legal residents, and the family members of Americans trapped under Israeli bombardment in Gaza.' According to CAIR, the plaintiffs in the case have ' tried, for months, to exhaust non-legal means to escape Gaza.' 'Each plaintiff in the lawsuit is eligible to be evacuated but has been summarily ignored by the State Department and other Biden administration officials,' CAIR wrote in a statement. The organization claims that the State Department has been sluggish in extracting American citizens caught in the crossfires of the Israel-Hamas war. In contrast, CAIR contends that the agency has responded with more urgency to evacuate American citizens caught in previous conflicts. CAIR claims that the State Department has run afoul of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, which 'guarantees equal protection for citizens and legal residents abroad under federal law.' 'The law requires the U.S. government to protect Americans wherever they may be. With every passing day, the danger of our clients dying from Israeli bombardment or the starvation and disease now rampant in Gaza only goes up,' CAIR attorney Maria Kari said. 'The State Department must do the right thing and save these people from certain death.' The State Department has cited the closure of the Rafah Crossing as the reason for the slowed evacuations of Americans from Gaza. However, the plaintiffs have called for evacuations to be conducted from the Kerem Shalom crossing, arguing that evacuations have been carried out from this site in previous conflicts between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group. CAIR’s lawsuit against Israel was not its first time stepping into controversy. The organization’s co-founder and executive director, Nihad Awad, said in November that he was 'happy' to witness Hamas’ rampage across southern Israel on Oct. 7, when the Palestinian terrorist group invaded the Jewish state from neighboring Gaza, murdered 1,200 people, and kidnapped over 250 others as hostages. The massacre launched the ongoing war in Gaza, where Israel has been waging a military campaign aimed at dismantling Hamas and freeing the hostages. 'The people of Gaza only decided to break the siege — the walls of the concentration camp — on Oct. 7,' CAIR co-founder and executive director Nihad Awad said in a speech during the American Muslims for Palestine convention in Chicago last November. 'And yes, I was happy to see people breaking the siege and throwing down the shackles of their own land, and walk free into their land, which they were not allowed to walk in.' According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), 'some of CAIR’s current leadership had early connections with organizations that are or were affiliated with Hamas.' CAIR has disputed the accuracy of the ADL’s claim and asserted that it 'unequivocally condemn[s] all acts of terrorism, whether carried out by al-Qa’ida, the Real IRA, FARC, Hamas, ETA, or any other group designated by the US Department of State as a ‘Foreign Terrorist Organization.’' The post CAIR sues US State Department over ‘failing to evacuate American citizens’ from Gaza appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/cair-sues-us-state-department-over-failing-to-evacuate-american-citizens-from-gaza/	2024-12-22T03:38:31-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shutterstock_1446195485-scaled.jpg
IDF introduces new security measures to protect Gaza aid trucks	By utilizing alternative routes, as well as Gate 96 near Netzarim in northern Gaza, the IDF has created safer pathways for aid deliveries, decreasing exposure to looters. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS The Israel Defense Forces has in recent days introduced a new arrangement to boost security for the passage of humanitarian aid into Gaza, directing aid convoys on the first stage of their journey through Israeli-secured routes in the Strip. Over this period, 400 aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip in four convoys of 100 trucks each, following routes along the IDF-controlled Philadelphi Corridor and the Gaza-Israel border road. This initiative has markedly decreased hijackings by Hamas terrorists and criminal gangs, meaning that more aid is reaching Gazan civilians. Aid trucks entering Gaza have been highly vulnerable to armed looters, with drivers frequently being wounded in hijackings. Hamas and local criminal families frequently intercepted these convoys, seizing valuable supplies and reselling them on the black market at exorbitant prices. Armed and masked Palestinians on trucks loaded with humanitarian aid entering southern Gaza through the Kerem Shalom Crossing from Israel, April 3, 2024. Photo by Abed Rahim Khatib/Flash90. On the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom Crossing in the southern part of the Strip on Thursday, trucks and forklift operators—the latter being Gazan employees—were busy loading and unloading goods that had passed a security screening. An IDF official explained: 'Hamas people, but also I would say … mafia clans, were coming until today with guns, with weapons, and looting and stealing these goods and reselling them to incredible prices on the market.' The scale of the problem was immense. By some estimates Hamas profited by as much as half a billion dollars. These funds enabled the group to bolster its military capabilities, including funding recruitment and recruiting new terrorists in northern Gaza. However, the new convoy system could form a partial solution. Trucks now travel under safer roads from Kerem Shalom to designated entry points into Gaza, minimizing opportunities for theft. Despite these improvements, challenges persist. At Kerem Shalom Crossing, large quantities of humanitarian aid remain stuck because a number of aid organizations have refused to send drivers into Gaza, citing safety concerns. 'Some of the drivers are injured,' an IDF source said on Thursday. That same day, the military got word of a driver who had been shot and wounded by looters. With over 800 trucks’ worth of supplies stranded at the crossing, the impasse underscores the ongoing risks faced by aid workers in Gaza. According to some reports, international aid organizations have even paid off looters to avoid attacks, particularly on shipments of essential goods such as medical supplies. Here is an inside look into the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom Crossing with COL Abdullah, a commander at @cogatonline. pic.twitter.com/G2zztnfSqD &mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) December 20, 2024 Col. Abdullah Halabi, head of the IDF’s Coordination and Liaison Administration for Gaza, highlighted the comprehensive screening and monitoring procedures now in place. 'All of the humanitarian aid coming to Kerem Shalom has been inspected by the Israeli side, and we’re delivering them to the Gazan side from here,' he stated. Halabi also emphasized the IDF’s efforts to increase aid deliveries. In December alone, an average of 250 trucks per day entered Gaza, including 50 to the north and 200 to central and southern Gazan areas. By utilizing alternative routes, as well as Gate 96 near Netzarim in northern Gaza, the IDF has created safer pathways for aid deliveries, decreasing exposure to looters. 'We escort them from [the] Philadelphi Corridor until the Rashid Road [south of Gaza city] … then they succeed to take the cargo [via] another road,' said Halabi. The cargo goes to warehouses in Gaza operated by international aid organizations, and from there to the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, as well as to population centers in Deir el-Balah and Nuseirat in central Gaza, and other areas. Some aid groups, such as UNICEF, the World Central Kitchen, Save the Children and others have successfully coordinated with the IDF to deliver essential supplies. Others, like the U.N.’s World Food Program and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), have not succeeded, leaving vital aid unused for months. 'The main obstacle or the main challenge is the international community’s capabilities [for distribution],' said Halabi. 'When they will send more trucks, we will bring more trucks to Kerem Shalom.' The IDF has urged aid organizations to increase their efforts, offering additional infrastructure to expedite deliveries. However, the risk of violence remains a deterrent for many. The IDF has repeatedly stated its commitment to facilitating humanitarian aid for Gaza’s civilian population, despite ongoing hostilities. 'Israel has, first and before anything else, [an] interest … [to] facilitate what we call humanitarian assistance getting into the Gaza Strip,' an IDF officer explained. 'Every day, we push the organizations to bring more trucks,' said Halabi.

UN condemned Israel three times as much as the rest of the world ...	Nearly three-quarters of all United Nations General Assembly motions condemning a country or countries in 2024 were directed at Israel, watchdog group says. By World Israel News Staff The United Nations passed nearly three times as many resolutions condemning Israel this year as it did resolutions condemning any other country on earth, a watchdog group said last week. In a statement issued Thursday night, UN Watch released data on motions passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2024 condemning one or more countries. The UN General Assembly rebuked Israel on Thursday in three separate resolutions, concluding the world body's 2024 activity with a total of 17 resolutions that single out the Jewish state, compared to a total of 6 regarding the rest of the world combined. Last Tuesday, the UNGA adopted one resolution each on the regimes of North Korea, Iran, Syria and Myanmar, and one on Russia's violations in Ukraine. In October, there was also one resolution condemning the U.S. for its embargo of Cuba. 'The UN’s latest assault on Israel with a torrent of one-sided resolutions is surreal,' said Hillel Neuer, Executive Director of UN Watch, an independent non-governmental organization based in Geneva. 'It's absurd that in the year 2024, out of a total of 23 UN General Assembly resolutions that criticize countries, 17 of them—nearly three quarters—were focused on a single country, Israel. Make no mistake, the purpose of the lopsided condemnations is to delegitimize Israel and to demonize and dehumanize Israelis,' continued Neuer. 'This demonization fuels the pro-Hamas agitators in America and around the world who today are targeting Jews with hate and violence on campus, at synagogues and community centers, and at their businesses.' While ignoring evidence that the UN's own relief agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, was complicit with the Hamas terror organization, the General Assembly voted last Thursday to back a resolution drafted by Norway's delegation, singling out Israel for the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. The resolution was passed by a margin of 137 to 12, with 22 abstentions. The measure expressed support for UNRWA despite the agency's ties to Gaza terrorists, while 'welcoming' a July 2024 International Court of Justice advisory opinion which declared that 'Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful.' The text made no mention of Hamas's looting of aid convoys as contributing to the humanitarian condition, UN Watch reported. 'We're not surprised to see Norway covering for terror-infested UNRWA,' said Neuer, 'given that the director of Norway's foreign ministry, Leni Stenseth, recently served as deputy chief of UNRWA, when she infamously visited Gaza and kowtowed before Hamas terror chief Yahya Sinwar.'

Germany refuses citizenship to migrant who denied Israel’s right ...	The Palestinian-born man had denied the Jewish state's right to exist, stating to authorities that 'There is no Israel.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A German court has ruled that a stateless Syrian could not become a citizen due to his anti-Israel views, according to court records publicized last week. The man, recognized as a refugee in 2016, had applied for naturalization in 2022 and passed a citizenship test. The Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution had then raised doubts due to his regular attendance of a Salafist mosque and extremely anti-Israel statements, and he was asked in for an interview. Two months before Hamas’ invasion of Israel last year that sparked the ongoing war, he was asked forthrightly whether he recognized Israel as an independent state. His answer, according to the records, was, 'There is no Israel. There are Jews, but Israel is not a country.' When the official asked again, 'You do not recognize the international agreement to create the State of Israel?' he immediately replied, 'No.' He later asked to revise his answers, claiming that he hadn’t understood the questions or that his answers had been misinterpreted. He wrote that he had 'no problem with Jewish people,' that it was all right for Jews to live in Israel, and that 'I also recognize the State of Israel after the Oslo peace process.' His intention, he insisted, had only been to criticize Israel’s 'occupation' of Palestinian land. The Office rejected the correction on the basis that his new statement was made as a tactical move to gain naturalization, and an administrative court agreed, upholding the ban in March. The applicant appealed, stating that his rejection of Israel's right to exist was not motivated by anti-Semitism, but by anti-Zionism. The Regensburg court in Bavaria ruled on October 7 that his rejection showed 'deep-seated anti-Zionist antisemitism,' that his subsequent statements about accepting post-Oslo Israel were disingenuous, and that a new emendation to the country’s Citizenship Act made it clear that he could not be naturalized. The June emendation requires that prospective citizens declare a commitment to Germany's 'historical responsibility' for Nazi crimes and their consequences and to 'protect Jewish life,' as well as commit to democracy and the peaceful coexistence of peoples. The court ruled that a commitment to Israel’s right to exist is included in this general formulation, as Germany’s responsibility is 'inevitably' linked to Israel as a homeland and sanctuary for the Jewish people. 'To obtain a German passport, individuals must accept Germany's moral obligations, including the recognition of Israel's existence,' the judge wrote. In addition, even though the naturalization decision predated the emendation, German law had already held that anyone who was antisemitic could not truthfully declare that he was committed to the German democratic order.

Why can’t Israel shoot down Houthi missiles?	The Houthi missiles may feature technology including maneuverable warheads, which are designed to avoid detection and interception. By World Israel News Staff A hypersonic missile that struck a park in southern Tel Aviv over the weekend has left Israelis on edge; both from the attack itself, which wounded 16, and from the fact that the missile, which was launched from Yemen by the Houthis, was not intercepted by Israel's air defense systems. Last Thursday, another ballistic missile launched by the terror group struck an elementary school in Ramat Gan, completely destroying a building. While the IDF initially claimed that the missile had been intercepted and the damage was due to shrapnel, the extent of the destruction raised serious questions. While the IDF said it is still investigating that incident, early findings suggest that the missile may have been struck by an interceptor, which failed to destroy the missile's warhead. That intact warhead appears to have struck the school, causing massive damage. Some military experts have offered explanations as to why the missiles were able to evade Israeli interception. 'The Houthis made changes to the missiles, including reducing the explosive payloads and adding more fuel. If at the beginning of the war they mainly reached Eilat, then today they are suddenly reaching the Gush Dan [Tel Aviv] area,' former IDF Air Defense commander Brig.-Gen. (res.) Zvika Haimovich told Channel 12 News. 'The Houthis have become Iran's first line of attack,' Haimovich added.'They have taken on this role, and that is why we have seen the threat intensify since the beginning of the ceasefire [with Hezbollah]. The solution is to escalate our steps against the Houthis, and deal with Iran as the initiator of the aggression.' Other security sources have suggested that the missiles, which were likely designed and manufactured in Iran, have maneuverable warheads. Designed to avoid detection, this feature sees the warhead detach from the missile and change its trajectory towards the end of its flight, making it extremely difficult to intercept. Another, less likely theory, is that the missile was launched in a 'flattened' trajectory from an unexpected location, meaning that it was not picked up by American or Saudi Arabian radar systems in the region. In a statement, the IDF pledged to apply lessons learned from the failures in future interceptions.

Defeat the Houthis to reopen the Port of Eilat: Local leaders	Houthi attacks on Red Sea ships lead to shut down of Israel' southernmost port. By World Israel News Staff The Houthi terror group has escalated its attacks against the Jewish State in recent days, with two ballistic missiles striking central Israel on Thursday and Friday. As the political and military echelon discuss retaliatory measures to deter future attacks, local leaders from Eilat are warning that the failure to curb Houthi attacks on shipping lanes in the Red Sea has crippled one of the city's most critical sites. The Port of Eilat, which serves ships traveling to Israel via the Red Sea, 'is an important, significant and central asset, which directly and indirectly employs hundreds of workers,' Eilat Mayor Eli Lankri told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. For more than a year, Houthi attacks on both the port itself and ships traveling through the Bab al-Mandab Strait near Yemen have meant that virtually no ships are arriving at the Port of Eilat. Lankri said that for the last 14 months, the port has been virtually shuttered and that residents have endured sporadic missile and drone attacks. A decisive military victory over the Houthis is the only way to restore security to residents of Eilat and encourage shipping companies to once again use the port. 'Securing Eilat is not just an urban interest but a national interest. Eilat is the southern gateway to the State of Israel, and as such, it must be kept open and safe,' Lankri added. Moshe Azulai, chair of the labor union representing the Port of Eilat's workers, told Ynet>/em> that the port is 'effectively closed.' Azulai said that despite initially negotiating with management to keep employees, nearly all the port's workers are currently on unpaid leave. 'It's sad to see the port like this,' Azulai, a native of Eilat, said. 'We are doing everything we can, but there is a serious problem, because there is no work.' Since the outbreak of the October 7th war, the Houthis have fired hundreds of missiles and explosive drones at Israel. In July 2024, one explosive drone struck a building in Tel Aviv - some 200 meters away from the American consulate - and killed a Belarussian-Israeli man.

Israel planning future strikes on Houthis: Report	Israel is currently gearing up for an additional wave of strikes targeting the Houthis. By World Israel News Staff Israel is planning to carry out additional strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, after ballistic missiles launched by the terror group struck central Israel twice in recent days. Last week, a missile struck an elementary school in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, destroying a building. The IAF launched retaliatory air strikes targeting three ports and oil facilities in Yemen several hours later, but the defiant Houthis pledged to keep up their attacks. Less than a day later, during the early hours of Saturday morning, the Houthis launched another hypersonic missile which evaded interception and struck a park in south Tel Aviv, wounding 16. On Saturday evening, a U.S.-led coalition attacked Houthi weapons depots and other strategic sites in Yemen. But according to reports, Israel is not confident that this will deter the Houthis from future attacks against the Jewish State. According to Hebrew-language outlet Kan News, Israel is currently gearing up for an additional wave of strikes on the Houthis. Jerusalem is also lobbying for other countries to support and even participate in the strikes, Kan News reported. The Houthis are the last Iranian proxy in the region that has not been significantly weakened by Israel in the ongoing war. Hezbollah and Hamas, which received funding and support from Iran, have both been crippled by the IDF sine the October 7th massacres. Shia-aligned militias in Syria have also significantly reduced their attacks against Israel, following the ouster of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad. The IAF previously struck Houthi targets in Yemen in July 2024, the day after an explosive drone launched by the terror group killed a Belarussian-Israeli man in Tel Aviv. Following a Houthi missile attack targeting Ben-Gurion Airport, Israel launched another wave of attacks on Houthi sites in September 2024.

Several hostage families receive evidence loved ones are alive	The report did not name the families contacted to protect their privacy and also did not indicate in what form this evidence was presented. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Several families of hostages have received evidence that their loved ones are still alive in Gaza, Channel 12 news reported Friday night. The report did not name the families contacted to protect their privacy and also did not indicate in what form this evidence was presented. Following months with little evidence that hostages are alive, Hamas released videos of Edan Alexander and Matan Zangauker last month, videos which appeared to have been taken recently. The families were also told that a hostage release deal could be reached within a week to ten days but cautioned that Hamas could create obstacles to this reality. The families were reportedly informed that the regional situation, American influence, the current status of the war, and other factors have created circumstances that increase the possibility of successful negotiations. However, the families were told that while conditions have improved, challenges remain, and efforts are ongoing with the hope of a breakthrough. Channel 12 reports that both sides agree on Palestinian prisoners who will be released in exchange for female, elderly, and sick hostages in the first phase of the deal. However, the point of contention was Israel's demand that prisoners who had murdered Israelis not be released to Judea and Samaria but should be made to go abroad. Lebanese outlet *Al-Akhbar* reported Thursday that, according to Hamas officials, 'The state of the negotiations underway in Doha is excellent, and most of the issues in dispute have been resolved, so it is possible that we will very soon have an agreement.' Israeli negotiators have been in talks with Hamas and American officials in Qatar since Monday, with CIA Director Bill Burns arriving on Wednesday. Saudi-owned *Asharq Al-Awsat* reported Wednesday that Hamas officials claimed an agreement was 'imminent' and could be signed by the end of the week. The London-based newspaper noted that, in the first of three stages, lasting 45-60 days, Hamas would release about 30 hostages, both alive and deceased.

US meets with terrorist who became Syrian leader, cancels $10 mil...	We haven’t committed any crimes that justify calling us a terrorist group,' al-Julani said in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday. By Andrew Bernard, JNS U.S. diplomats carried out their first visit to the Syrian capital of Damascus in more than a decade on Friday for meetings with the new government following the fall of longtime Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. Barbara Leaf, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, told reporters that she had informed Abu Mohammad al-Julani, leader of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that led Assad’s overthrow, that the United States would not pursue a $10 million terrorism bounty on him for his role as the head of a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist group. Julani, whose real name is Ahmad al-Sharaa, told Leaf that he 'committed' to not allowing terrorist groups to pose a threat within Syria or externally to the United States and its regional partners. 'Based on our discussion, I told him we would not be pursuing the Rewards for Justice reward offer that has been in effect for some years,' Leaf said. HTS emerged as a splinter organization from al-Qaeda’s Syria branch, the Nusrah Front, which was founded in 2012 as an extension of the Iraqi insurgency amid Syria’s burgeoning civil war. A Syrian national, Julani joined al-Qaeda in Iraq in 2003 shortly before the U.S. invasion and was arrested by American forces in 2006 and imprisoned for five years. The U.S. State Department first designated the Nusra Front as a terrorist organization in 2012 as an alias of al-Qaeda in Iraq and labeled HTS a terrorist group in 2018 following repeated splits, reorganizations and renamings. Julani has been a U.S. 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist' since 2013 and has been repeatedly accused of carrying out attacks on civilians. His group announced its official split from al-Qaeda in 2016, and in recent years, he has sought to portray himself and HTS as pragmatic and has argued that the group should be delisted as a terrorist organization. 'We haven’t committed any crimes that justify calling us a terrorist group,' Julani said in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday. 'Sanctions must be lifted, because they were targeted at the old regime. The victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way.' Leaf said on Friday that Washington was 'beginning a discussion with HTS.' 'If I’m sitting with the HTS leader and having a lengthy, detailed discussion about a whole series of interests of the U.S., interests of Syria, maybe interests of the region, suffice it to say it’s a little incoherent then to have a bounty on the guy’s head,' Leaf said. 'Otherwise, I should ask the FBI to come in and arrest him or something.' The meeting was the first public interaction between U.S. diplomats and Julani and the first U.S. diplomatic visit to Damascus since 2012, when Washington withdrew its diplomats when it cut off relations with the Assad regime. Leaf said she could not preview the lifting of any sanctions in Syria but that she expected the interim government to face internal pressure from the Syrian people to conform with the requirements for lifting sanctions under the U.S. Caesar Act and U.N. Security Council resolution 2254. The U.S. diplomats also sought information from the new Syrian government about the fate of Austin Tice, a U.S. citizen and freelance journalist who was kidnapped in Syria in 2012. Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, said it has been difficult to find out what happened to Tice given the labyrinthine nature of Assad’s security infrastructure. 'I’ve been rather amazed at the amount of secret prisons that Assad seems to have amassed,' Carstens said, adding that the search for Tice might ultimately require examining as many as 40 prison sites. The U.S. diplomats did not mention any discussion of Israel’s presence in Syria, which has expanded following the fall of the Assad regime to include control of all of Mount Hermon and a buffer zone inside Syria along the border. Leaf, however, said that Washington has definite views about the roles of other regional powers inside Syria. 'Turkey obviously has a very sizable role, has sizable influence,' Leaf said. 'It has historically, and it’s a neighboring state, and it has national security interests and all sorts of other interests.' 'Iran will have no role whatsoever, and it shouldn’t,' she said. 'Iran’s had decades now of the most predatory and destructive behavior and presence in Syria and during the war itself mustered foreign militias, its own IRGC forces, Hezbollah fighters, and really preyed upon and really viciously brutalized the Syrian people.' 'It’s hard for me to imagine Iran having any role whatsoever,' she added. 'Why should it?'

Sweden ends UNRWA funding amid controversy over Hamas ties and Oc...	Knesset member Yulia Malinovsky, the sponsor of a bill to sever Israel’s ties with UNRWA, attributed Sweden’s decision to Israeli legislative efforts. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Sweden has officially ceased its financial support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), Aid Minister Benjamin Dousa announced during an interview with TV4 on Friday. Dousa stated that Stockholm would redirect its humanitarian assistance to Gaza through alternative channels. This move comes amidst intensified scrutiny of UNRWA’s operations, particularly in the aftermath of Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel. 'UNRWA, whose personnel actively participated in the October 7 atrocities, whose facilities became terror hubs, and whose schools spread Hamas propaganda and incitement, has lost its legitimacy to exist,' Israeli Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli said while commending Sweden’s decision on X (formerly Twitter). Knesset member Yulia Malinovsky, the sponsor of a bill to sever Israel’s ties with UNRWA, attributed Sweden’s decision to Israeli legislative efforts. 'When Israel takes decisive action, the world follows,' she claimed in a statement to The Press Service of Israel. 'Once the law passed, the world itself would stop funding this organization, and this is exactly what’s happening now.' Israel’s skepticism toward UNRWA has deepened over the past year. In February, Israeli forces discovered a Hamas complex beneath UNRWA’s Gaza City headquarters, raising alarms about the agency’s role in enabling terrorist activities. Further, Israel’s largest bank froze UNRWA’s accounts over suspicious financial activity. Israeli intelligence has implicated UNRWA staff in Hamas operations, including during the October 7 attacks, where more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and over 250 taken hostage. A recent internal UN investigation led to the termination of nine staff members, but Israeli officials criticized the probe as 'inadequate,' claiming the agency ignored evidence against at least 100 personnel. UNRWA was also ordered to vacate its Jerusalem offices in May over lease violations. UNRWA’s critics have also pointed to its unique mandate, which supports Palestinian refugees and their descendants—a stark contrast to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which assists all other refugee populations globally. Sweden’s move aligns with a growing international trend of reevaluating UNRWA’s legitimacy. Earlier this year, Israel officially cut ties with the agency, and lawsuits have been filed against UNRWA, accusing it of aiding Hamas. Analysts suggest that UNRWA’s deeply embedded presence in Gaza—providing education, healthcare, and financial aid—has made it vulnerable to exploitation by militant groups. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015 and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Netanyahu: Strikes against Houthis are protecting entire world	Sixteen people were lightly wounded overnight on Friday when a ballistic missile fired by Houthis struck Tel Aviv's Jaffa neighborhood. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following IDF strikes on Thursday against Houthi targets, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that the operations are not just protecting Israel, 'but the entire world.' 'They are not only attacking us,' Netanyahu said in a video statement. 'They are attacking the entire world. They are attacking international shipping and trade routes.' IAF planes struck the western coast and, for the first time, in the rebel-held capital Sana’a. 'When Israel acts against the Houthis, it acts for the entire international community,' Netanyahu said, adding Israel's allies 'understand this well.' The premiere noted that the Houthis were the last Iranian proxy left 'after Hamas, Hezbollah and the Assad regime in Syria.' He added the Houthis 'are learning and they will learn the hard way that anyone who attacks Israel pays a very heavy price.' Sixteen people were lightly wounded overnight on Friday when a ballistic missile, fired by Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists in Yemen, struck a residential area in Tel Aviv's Jaffa neighborhood at 3:44 a.m. The blast created a crater in a local playground. Magen David Adom paramedics treated at least 14 of the injured, mostly for cuts from glass shards caused by the explosion. The victims were evacuated to Wolfson Medical Center in Holon and Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) in Tel Aviv. Additionally, 14 people were injured while heading to a protected area, and seven others suffered from anxiety. Millions of residents in the greater Tel Aviv area rushed to protected spaces after hearing air-raid sirens. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed that the missile hit following 'unsuccessful interception attempts.' The military was probing the circumstances of the attack. The IDF stated that only a partial interception of the missile launched from Yemen occurred, and the warhead likely exploded, causing damage to the school. The IAF and Home Front Command are conducting a more thorough investigation into the incident.

Topography, security, and survival highlight Israel’s Syrian stra...	The Golan Heights’ mountainous terrain provides critical surveillance points overlooking Damascus, Beirut, and Jerusalem, and from a security perspective, this topographical advantage is invaluable. By Jewish Breaking News Israel’s recent moves to establish a security buffer zone in Syria represent not just tactical necessity, but strategic wisdom in an increasingly volatile Middle East. While critics may decry this as territorial expansion, they fundamentally misunderstand the security imperatives facing the Jewish state. Assad’s downfall has created a dangerous power vacuum, with various militias jostling for control near Israel’s borders. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s government in Damascus offers no guarantees of stability, nor do we know if his newfound power will intoxicate him like it did Assad. More concerning is the persistent threat of Iranian weapons flowing through Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Golan Heights’ mountainous terrain provides critical surveillance points overlooking Damascus, Beirut, and Jerusalem. From a security perspective, this topographical advantage is invaluable. Critics conveniently forget that Israel’s previous withdrawals from territories have often resulted in security disasters. Since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, a UN-monitored demilitarized zone of about 400 square kilometers has separated Israeli-held Golan Heights from Syria proper. Overseen by 1,100 UN peacekeepers, this arrangement was meant to ensure stability. Now, with Syria’s downfall, the UN’s track record suggests it won’t look out for Israel’s survival. Those wringing their hands about international law such as Saudi Arabia should remember that Israel’s security cannot be sacrificed for failed theoretical legal frameworks. On Thursday the Kingdom put out a statement condemning Israel’s 'occupation' in Syria. 'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s strong condemnation and denunciation of the Israeli occupation government’s decision to expand settlements in the occupied Golan Heights and its continued sabotaging of Syria’s prospects for restoring its security and stability. The Kingdom reiterates its call on the international community to denounce these Israeli violations, emphasizing the importance of respecting Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Kingdom reaffirms that the occupied Golan is Syrian, Arab land.' The only international opinion that matters is that of the United States, which under President Trump recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. His historic recognition back in 2019 acknowledged both Israel’s birthright and, now more than ever, her security realities.

The IAF and Home Front Command were conducting a more in-depth probe. The damage caused from a Ballistic missile fired from Yemen at a school in Ramat Gan, December 19, 2024. (Flash90/Avshalom Sassoni) The Israeli strikes against the Houthis were carried out in two waves by 14 fighter jets, refuelers and spy planes, which were already en route to Yemen when the enemy fired its ballistic missile at Ramat Gan around 2:35 a.m. on Thursday. The first IAF strikes hit at 3:15 a.m., targeting the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea as well as the Hodeidah and Salif ports. Eight tugboats, used for guiding ships into the ports, were also destroyed. At 4:30 a.m., the second wave targeted the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, hitting the Haziz and D’Habban power stations, according to reports. 'Over the past year, the Houthi terrorist regime has been operating with the direction and funding of Iran, and in cooperation with Iraqi militias, in order to attack the State of Israel and Israeli civilians,' the IDF said following the IAF operation. 'The conducted strikes degrade the Houthi terrorist regime, preventing it from exploiting the targets for military and terrorist purposes, including the smuggling of Iranian weapons to the region,' the statement continued. 'The IDF is determined to continue operating against all threats posed to the citizens of the State of Israel, wherever necessary.'

Earlier, an Israeli Navy ship intercepted a Houthi drone over the Red Sea before it crossed into Israeli territory. On Dec. 9, a Houthi drone hit a residential high-rise building in the central Israeli city of Yavne, northeast of Ashdod. On Dec. 1, a ballistic missile launched from Yemen triggered sirens in the Judean Foothills (the Shfela region). The Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched over 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the Gaza-based terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in the northwestern Negev. In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv. In response, Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port. On Sept. 29, the Israeli Air Force carried out dozens of strikes in the area of Hodeidah. The targets included 'power plants and a seaport, which were used by the Houthis to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil,' the IDF said.

Ramat Gan Mayor: ‘We were lucky there were no children at school’...	The Mayor announced the damage was 40 million shekel ($11 million) and that a replacement Ramat Ef’al elementary school building would be constructed. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Thursday, Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shama-Hacohen expressed gratitude that there were no children at the school targeted by a Houthi ballistic missile overnight. The multistory building collapsed on impact with the partially intercepted ballistic missile. Footage from the scene circulating on social media show a building with its wall blown off, exposing the classroom inside. Partially collapsed roofs, shattered glass, and scattered debris are also seen. The Mayor announced the damage was 40 million shekel ($11 million) and that a replacement Ramat Ef’al elementary school building would be constructed. The Ramat Gan municipality said in a statement that students in grades 1-4, including special education students, will attend classes in nearby schools. Students in the 5th and 6th grades will attend classes online. The IDF initially announced it had intercepted the missile, but a part of the missile or the interceptor fell on the school destroying it. There were no reported injuries, but some parked cars were damaged by debris. The missile set off sirens in central Israel, with citizens crowding into bomb shelters in the middle of the night. The Israeli Air Force struck numerous Houthi-controlled assets in Yemen, including major ports and oil sites, during the early hours of Thursday morning, as the terror group launched a ballistic missile that triggered sirens throughout central Israel.

Lebanese sheik: ‘Israel has left nothing of Hezbollah’	Mourab also criticized Iran for the destruction of its terror proxy By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Sunni Sheikh Hassan Mourab, a supporter of Hezbollah, told Lebanese television that 'Israel has left nothing of Hezbollah.' Discussing the assassinations of Hezbollah leadership, he said, 'The organization has suffered severe blows at the high command levels, the lower levels, and in the infrastructure in southern Lebanon.' Mourab added,'What else is left that the enemy has not achieved? What else is left for them to do?' What is left for us? Tell me.' 'Southern Lebanon has been completely destroyed. And at the end, Hezbollah was also forbidden from operating weapons inside Lebanon and outside it. Okay? So what is left of Hezbollah? Nothing. The organization has become powerless.' Mourab also criticized Iran for the destruction of its terror proxy. 'Iran is the one that destroyed Hezbollah more than anything else. I believe that Iranian conduct has led to a decline in the organization’s power, and this is evident in the reality on the ground.' According to the World Bank, Lebanon has experienced $8.5 billion in damages and economic losses due to the ongoing conflict—$3.4 billion in physical infrastructure damage and $5.1 billion in broader economic losses. Over the past 14 months, Hezbollah is believed to have suffered casualties as high as 10 times the number it lost during the 2006 Second Lebanon War, which lasted for a month. An assessment by Israel’s Channel 12 News and the Institute for National Security Studies indicates that the Israeli military estimates Hezbollah has lost approximately 3,000 fighters in Lebanon, including at least 11 brigade commanders, 37 battalion commanders, and 46 company commanders. A source with knowledge of Hezbollah’s operations told Reuters on Thursday that as many as 4,000 terrorists may have been killed, the majority of them since September. This increase in casualties came after Jerusalem escalated its offensive in Lebanon, adding the return of tens of thousands of displaced residents to their homes in the north to its official war objectives.

By Jewish Breaking News As speculation and debate continue to rage over how the Democrats got beaten so badly in November, new post-election polling data reveals what voters really wanted. Four years ago, Joe Biden beat Donald Trump’s first chance at election by promising to restore faith in democracy and government. Vice President Harris tried out the exact same playbook as she tried to become the nation’s first female president. She ended up walking into a buzzsaw of voters more interested in results than rhetoric. According to the first comprehensive post-election poll by George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management, while trust in government took a nosedive after the election – with 39% of voters saying their confidence had dropped – Americans still picked Trump’s promise of action over Harris’s pledge of integrity. When asked about government effectiveness under the new administration, 40% expect improvement compared to 36% predicting decline. The contrast was even starker among independents, a crucial voting bloc that broke decisively against Democrats. By a 13-point margin (39% to 26%), independents reported decreased trust in government following the election. Similarly, they expressed less confidence in receiving accurate information by an 11-point margin (39% to 28%). However, these same independent voters believed by a 10-point margin (39% to 29%) that the Trump administration would prove more effective at achieving results. America’s fractured media landscape also proved instrumental in sinking Democratic 'trust us' messaging. Three-quarters of voters under 30 now get their news from social media, while 84% of seniors stick to television. The divide gets even sharper on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, where 61% and 55% of young voters turn for news compared to single digits among those over 65. Trump capitalized on this divide, with his headline-grabbing Joe Rogan podcast appearance racking up over 27 million YouTube views and dominating social media feeds for weeks. Concerns about misinformation loomed large, with 69% of Americans reporting that online disinformation made it harder to access 'fair and truthful news during the 2024 election campaign.' A similar 71% expressed worry about the role of 'deepfakes' in spreading false information. Perhaps most troubling for both parties, 45% of Americans now say they trust neither the government nor news organizations to provide accurate information. It’s clear Americans have grown cynical enough to separate belief from results and prefer a distrusted government that delivers than a trusted one that doesn’t. After watching their party get wiped out in the House, and Senate, and an embarrassing presidential defeat, Democrats are left to ponder whether their cherished 'democracy first' message has finally hit its expiration date.

Fani Willis barred from Trump election case	Willis claimed that her intimate relationship with Wade did not begin until after she appointed him to the case in 2021, despite testimony from witnesses that it began in 2019. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon A Georgia Court of Appeals on Thursday removed Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis from the 2020 election interference case against President-elect Donald Trump due to her romantic relationship with the case’s lead prosecutor. The judges said Willis’s affair with ex-special prosecutor Nathan Wade presents 'significant appearance of impropriety' and 'no other remedy will suffice to restore public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings' than to disqualify Willis from the case. The court did not dismiss the charges against Trump, but throwing out Willis’s office leaves the future of the case uncertain. The Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia is responsible for finding another prosecutor to take over the case and deciding whether to continue to pursue it, according to the Associated Press. Willis claimed that her intimate relationship with Wade did not begin until after she appointed him to the case in 2021, despite testimony from witnesses that it began in 2019. Fulton County Superior Court judge Scott McAfee ruled in March that Willis would be allowed to stay on the case but that Wade would have to be removed due to the 'appearance of impropriety.' He resigned hours later. 'After carefully considering the trial court’s findings in its order, we conclude that it erred by failing to disqualify DA Willis and her office,' the Appeals Court ruling reads. 'The remedy crafted by the trial court to prevent an ongoing appearance of impropriety did nothing to address the appearance of impropriety that existed at times when DA Willis was exercising her broad pretrial discretion about who to prosecute and what charges to bring,' it continued. 'In granting President Trump an overwhelming mandate, the American People have demanded an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all the Witch Hunts against him,' Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement celebrating the court's ruling. 'We look forward to uniting our country as President Trump Makes America Great Again.'

Supreme Court to Ben Gvir: ‘Why Aren’t Nukhba terrorists prisoner...	Ben Gvir: 'The Israel Prison Service is diligent in ensuring compliance with the law, providing only the bare minimum required by legal standards.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Supreme Court issued a conditional order on Thursday to National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir asking him to provide an explanation why prisoners of the Nukba Force, the wing of Hamas that carried out the October 7th massacre, aren't being given sufficient food. The order follows a petition by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, that claims 'there is a significant decrease in the weight of prisoners and security detainees.' The decision read, 'A conditional order is hereby issued, directing the respondents to appear and explain why they have not taken steps to ensure that security prisoners are provided with food that meets basic living conditions as required by applicable law.' The Association for Civil Rights, which filed the petition against Ben-Gvir, commented: 'The Supreme Court has upheld our position. The fact that the State is required to respond to this issue marks a profoundly troubling moral low.' Ben Gvir responded by saying, 'Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has become a protector of those Nukhba terrorists who slaughtered, raped, burned, and kidnapped our sons and daughters with Nazi-like cruelty.' 'The Israel Prison Service is diligent in ensuring compliance with the law, providing only the bare minimum required by legal standards, and nothing more. During my tenure, the era of luxuries like marmalades and lamb will end. There will be no more bakeries or canteens funded by terrorist money,' he added. 'No more 'hotel accommodations' in terrorist prisons. The Supreme Court seems intent on returning us to the days of all-inclusive summer camps. The Israeli public will be the judge.' A Palestinian terrorist convicted of kidnapping and killing an Israeli teenager has petitioned a judge after the Israel Prison Service (IPS) denied him the 'right' to play videogames. Iham Kamamji, a Palestinian Islamic Jihad member serving two life sentences for his role in the 2006 kidnapping and murder of 18-year-old Eliyahu Asheri, said the prison administration had previously allowed him to have a Sony PlayStation 2 in his cell.

Former Mossad agents will reveal secrets behind Hezbollah beepers...	The program will discuss previously unreleased information about the operation that was years in the making. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Former Mossad agents who were involved in the 'exploding beeper' operation that devastated Hezbollah several months ago will reveal secrets of the mission for the first time on ABC's 60 Minutes on Sunday. The program will discuss previously unreleased information about the operation that was years in the making. On September 17, thousands of pagers issued by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to its operatives exploded simultaneously. It was reported that 12 terrorists had been killed by the beepers and thousands injured. A former commander of British military forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, praised the beeper offensive against Hezbollah as 'precise and discriminatory' and effective at weakening the morale and capacity of the Lebanese terror group. Israel's outsmarting them with this terror attack has led to Hezbollah's 'demoralization.' Kemp also praised the mission because it effectively targeted only terrorists and limited civilian casualties. 'It's hard to think of a more precise and discriminating method of attack than detonating pagers known to be specifically assigned to individual terrorists, using devices that limit the potential for collateral damage.' He added that the exploding beepers were intended only for terrorists who are 'legitimate and lawful targets for attack as Israel seeks to defend its citizens from violent aggression,' he said. Kemp added that three distinctive characteristics of the mission made it particularly effective. First, the mission resulted in extensive damage to Hezbollah, second it engendered anxiety in Hezbollah members and may discourage others from joining and third, it has humiliated Hezbollah on the world stage. The now-deceased leader of Hezbollah at the time, Hassan Nasrallah, declared the exploding beepers were an 'act of war.' Nasrallah said, 'We undoubtedly suffered a major security and humanitarian blow, unprecedented in the conflict and maybe in the history of mankind.' Nasrallah added, 'We were hit hard, but that's the situation in war. We understand that the enemy has technological supremacy. Especially since the we and the West support it.'

Iran eyes Sudan to choke Israel’s economy with Russian backing	Both Russia and Iran have held high-level talks in recent months to establish military bases in Port Sudan. By Jewish Breaking News Israel’s sustained attacks on its proxy force Hezbollah in Lebanon have forced Iran to turn its attention to Sudan in an effort to destabilize maritime security and shipping routes critical to the Jewish State’s economy. According to an explosive report by Bloomberg, Iranian military support has increased dramatically in Sudan. In January, Sudan’s paramilitary forces shot down a drone near the capital Khartoum that weapons experts identified as an Iranian design – the Ababil model. While this drone was assembled in Sudan, it was built using parts shipped in from Iran. But what really caught the attention of security experts are satellite images revealing the presence of Iran’s Mohajer-6 drone at Sudan’s Wadi Sayyidna air base. Unlike the basic Ababil, the Mohajer-6 is a combat drone made by Iran’s Quds Air Industries that can carry and launch precision-guided missiles. Between January and July 2024, at least seven flights between Tehran and Port Sudan were operated by Qeshm Fars Air, a US-sanctioned airline with documented ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force unit. What raised suspicions for intelligence officials was where these cargo planes were landing back in Tehran. Instead of using a regular commercial area like normal cargo flights, they touched down in a restricted military zone of Mehrabad Airport reserved only for Iran’s Air Force. For planes operated by a civilian cargo company to be landing in military areas suggests they weren’t exactly hauling commercial goods. Russia’s involvement has been equally substantial. Following a June meeting between Sudan’s deputy leader Malik Agar and Russian officials, Moscow reportedly offered an S-400 surface-to-air missile defense system, though Sudan has hesitated to accept, fearing Western backlash. Russia has also dramatically scaled up fuel shipments, delivering 2.8 million barrels of diesel and gasoline between April and October. At least 12 tankers from various Russian ports, most with undisclosed ownership, have docked in Port Sudan since March. Bloomberg’s investigation also reveals both Russia and Iran have held high-level talks in recent months to establish military bases in Port Sudan. Satellite images show rapid military expansion at Port Sudan International Airport, where new hangars and storage facilities have been built in its military wing. Meanwhile, at the city’s seaport, officials speaking anonymously described how military intelligence regularly cordons off the southern terminal to secretly unload weapons shipments. Their combined military support has already shifted the balance of power in Sudan’s civil war, helping the army recapture parts of Khartoum and vast territories from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Since April, over 11 million Sudanese have been displaced and more than 2 million are facing potential famine. For Israel, this emerging Russian-Iranian military presence along the Red Sea represents a significant strategic threat. If plans for military facilities in Port Sudan are followed through, it would give Iran unprecedented ability to disrupt Israeli shipping so critical for its economy.

Nazareth teen indicted for spying for Hezbollah	Saadi allegedly transmitted missile impact locations, aircraft movements, and the positioning of Israeli military units. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli authorities arrested a 19-year-old resident of Nazareth accused of recently passing sensitive information to Hezbollah, it was cleared for publication on Thursday. The indictment charges Muhammad Saadi with having repeated contact with the Lebanon-based terror group for several years and making several attempts to join its ranks. He is also accused of communicating with Hezbollah’s television station, Al-Manar, providing photos and videos. When Hezbollah began launching daily rocket and drone attacks after Hamas’s October 7 attack, Saadi allegedly transmitted missile impact locations, aircraft movements, and the positioning of Israeli military units. 'The investigation of the affair once again revealed the fact that the elements of the Shiite axis led by Iran are working to promote terrorist activity in Israel, including by recruiting residents of the State of Israel who are exploited by them for espionage activities for their needs,' the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) said.

IDF hits Tulkarem terror cell, reportedly killing Fatah commander	Judea and Samaria leaders on Sunday issued a letter to Israel’s Security Cabinet before its weekly meeting, calling on the government to take preventative military measures amid an uptick in terrorism. By JNS An Israeli Air Force craft attacked a terrorist cell in the western Samaria city of Tulkarem on Thursday afternoon. According to the Palestinian Authority, the IAF strike killed four people, including Tareq al-Doush, a local commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a 'military' arm of P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah party. Two months ago, al-Doush told the anti-Israel Mondoweiss website that Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre of some 1,200 people 'was like a dream for us.' The terrorist Tareq al-Dosh, commander of the Al-Aqsa Brigades, Tulkarm Battalion, was eliminated. pic.twitter.com/lyOYrCxVuk &mdash; נועה מגיד | Noa magid (@NoaMagid) December 19, 2024 Palestinian media reported that the IDF was also implementing a 'pressure cooker' protocol—increased gunfire to force a wanted terrorist out—in Nablus, some 12 miles southeast of Tulkarem. Arab reports claimed that at least two people were killed and several others were wounded during the military raid in the Samaria city. Judea and Samaria leaders on Sunday issued a letter to Israel’s Security Cabinet before its weekly meeting, calling on the government to take preventative military measures amid an uptick in terrorism. According to Israel’s Channel 14 News broadcaster, Cabinet members convened at IDF Central Command headquarters near Jerusalem’s Neve Yaakov neighborhood on Sunday to discuss security developments in Judea and Samaria. In recent years, Iranian-backed terrorist groups have taken over cities and towns in Samaria, including Jenin and Tulkarem, prompting Israeli forces to carry out counter-terrorism raids. Under the terms of the Oslo Accords, which Jerusalem signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1990s, the newly created P.A. was tasked with fighting terrorism in parts of Judea and Samaria. The Palestinian Authority earlier this month launched a rare counter-terror operation due to fears that terrorist organizations could attempt a coup inspired by the rebel takedown of Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria. Last week, Islamic Jihad terrorists from Tulkarem reportedly shot at the headquarters of the P.A. police in the city, lightly wounding two officers. Members of Ramallah’s forces have a long history of carrying out attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians. Last year, Fatah boasted that most of its 'martyrs' had served in the Palestinian Authority Security Forces. In addition, the Hamas terrorist organization has recruited dozens of PASF operatives, using them as terrorist combatants and for intelligence gathering, Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster reported in mid-2023.

Blinken says there is still time to negotiate nuclear deal with I...	I don't think that a nuclear weapon is inevitable,' the secretary of state told the Council on Foreign Relations. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that there is still time to negotiate nuclear deal with Iran, despite the opinion of the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog. Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Blinken said, 'I don't think that a nuclear weapon is inevitable,' and that 'there is the prospect of negotiations' with the incoming Republican administration. He did acknowledge circumstances had somewhat changed recently, saying that the Iranians have recently 'lost different lines of defense' so 'sure, you're going to see more thinking' about racing to a bomb. The Islamic Republic has just seen its most important client state, Syria, fall to Sunni Islamist rebels almost without a fight, and its chief terror proxy, Hezbollah in Lebanon, decimated by the IDF and agree to a ceasefire and withdrawal miles away from Israel. In addition, in retaliation for Iran’s second unsuccessful attempt at striking Israel with a massive wave of missiles in October, the IDF destroyed vital components of the mullahs’ ballistic missile program as well all their advanced air defenses in an airstrike later that month. Incoming president Donald Trump, who had pulled out of the old nuclear deal in 2018, calling it 'terrible,' had 'said he wanted, as he called it, a better, stronger deal. Fine,' Blinken said. The secretary of state spoke just two days after International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi told Italian news agency ANSA that 'The philosophy of the original accord with Iran can be used, but that agreement is no longer useful.' This is because the Islamic Republic had 'developed much stronger capabilities,' he explained, noting that 'It has uranium at 60% — 90% is military grade — and is thus practically at the same level as nuclear-armed states.' According to the nuclear watchdog, as of October 26, Iran has 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of 60% enriched uranium, which has no civilian use whatsoever. It is only a very short technical step between the two levels, and the IAEA reported earlier this month that Iran is 'likely' to have enough enriched uranium to build four bombs. At the same time, the Americans’ Office of National Intelligence officially estimated that the mullahs have 'enough fissile material to make more than a dozen nuclear weapons,' although the decision to go for one has not yet been made. It will be 'a complex process' to 'define a system that serves the new Iranian reality,' Rossi said. In his speech, the secretary of state noted as a bottom line that no American administration would allow Iran to obtain a nuclear bomb.

18 notable Jews who died in 2024	In chronological order, here is a selection of obituaries of 18 notable Jews who died in 2024. By, JTA As 2024 comes to a close, we look back and mourn the Jewish icons who have left outsized legacies on politics, the arts, sports and everything in between. In chronological order, here is a selection of obituaries of 18 notable Jews who died in 2024. Pearl Berg At the time of her death, Pearl Berg was thought to be the oldest Jewish person in the world, and the ninth-oldest overall. A philanthropist active in her local Hadassah chapter, Berg was married for 58 years to Mark Berg, a businessman and investor. He died in 1989. 'She maybe had a sip of Sabbath wine but she didn’t drink, she didn’t smoke, she ate sensibly, she had good emotional balance and she clearly had remarkable genes,' Berg’s youngest son, Robert Berg, told the Los Angeles Times. She died on Feb. 1 at 114. Charlie Biton In 1971, Charlie Biton co-founded the Israeli Black Panthers, a movement that fought against the racism and poverty experienced by Mizrahi Jews in Israel. That set Biton on a course of activism and politics that would have seemed unlikely for someone with limited schooling and a criminal background. Biton rode the success of his protest group to a 15-year career as a member of Israel’s parliament, serving from 1977 to 1992 mostly alongside communists in the Hadash faction. Biton distinguished himself as a fighter for social change and an early voice for peace with the Palestinians. He died on Feb. 24 at 76. Richard Lewis Comedian Richard Lewis parlayed his neurotic Jewish personality and self-deprecating humor into a 50-year career as a standup and actor. Most notably, he starred in the ABC sitcom 'Anything but Love,' and played a fictionalized version of himself in HBO’s 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' from 2000 until 2024. Said Larry David, the show’s creator and Lewis’ close friend, 'He had that rare combination of being the funniest person and also the sweetest.' He died on Feb. 27 at 76. Martin Greenfield Martin Greenfield survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald, where he learned to sew after accidentally tearing a Nazi soldier’s shirt. After immigrating to the United States, he became a master tailor who dressed a series of presidents from Dwight Eisenhower to Barack Obama. Working out of a third-floor office in his East Williamsburg factory, Greenfield became one of the best-known — and some would say best — men’s tailors in the country. 'Receiving your first tailoring lesson inside a Nazi concentration camp was hardly the ideal apprenticeship,' Greenfield recalled in his memoir. 'I would have much preferred to hone my craft on Savile Row or in the mills of Milan. Looking back, though, that moment in the camps marked the beginning of the rest of my life.' He died on March 20 at 95. Joe Lieberman Joseph Lieberman served as a senator from Connecticut for 24 years and, as Al Gore’s running mate in 2000, became the first Jew on a major presidential ticket. A moderate — some would say conservative — Democrat turned independent, Lieberman was known for his attempts to build bridges in an increasingly polarized Washington, sometimes losing old friends and allies along the way. Lieberman died on March 27 at 82. Ken Holtzman Ken Holtzman, who played 15 seasons in the major leagues, was the winningest Jewish pitcher in baseball history. The MLB veteran threw two no-hitters, won four World Series rings and made two All-Star teams. A leftie, he played for the Chicago Cubs in two stints; the Oakland Athletics, where he won three consecutive titles from 1972-1974; the Baltimore Orioles; and the New York Yankees, where he won his fourth ring in 1978 despite not appearing in the series. In his retirement, he worked at his hometown Jewish community center. He died on April 15 at 78. Rabbi Moshe Kotlarsky A leading figure in the Chabad-Lubavitch community, Rabbi Moshe Kotlarsky was known for his efforts to build the Hasidic movement’s global outreach efforts and for his personal ties with community members. As chairman of various Chabad affiliates, Kotlarsky played a key role in carrying out the vision of the movement’s late leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, known as the Rebbe, in launching what are now more than 5,000 outreach centers in more than 100 countries. 'He was caring for everybody and that’s why everybody feels so close,' said one rabbi who flew to Brooklyn from Amsterdam for his funeral. Kotlarsky died on June 4 at 74. Kinky Friedman As a cigar-chomping, mustachioed Texan country singer and mystery novelist, Kinky Friedman’s body of work often seemed like the un-kosher marriage of the Borscht Belt and the Bible Belt. The frontman for the flamboyant 1970s country group Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys, he was notorious for satirical songs such as 'They Don’t Make Jews Like Jesus Anymore,' a raucous sendup of racism, while also turning serious with works like the 1973 song 'Ride ’em Jewboy,' a haunting elegy on the Holocaust recorded by Willie Nelson and sung in concert by Bob Dylan. Friedman died on June 27 at 79. Ruth Westheimer A Holocaust survivor and Israeli military veteran, the diminutive Ruth Westheimer charmed and educated millions of listeners as the taboo-breaking radio sex therapist known as 'Dr. Ruth.' Her program, 'Sexually Speaking,’' which launched in 1980 on the now-defunct WYNY-FM, broke broadcasting taboos around talking about sex and helped make her the most famous sex therapist in the world — albeit one with a motherly demeanor and thick German accent. She was a firm believer in sex as healthy dialogue among consenting partners, and also emphasized psychology over biology. 'When it comes to sex, the most important six inches are the ones between the ears,' she once famously said. She died on July 12 at 96. Queenie Hallegua When a JTA correspondent visited Kochi, India in 2020, a researcher said only two Jews were still living in Jew Town, a once-vibrant community where perhaps 3,000 Jews lived at its peak in the 1950s. The death of Queenie Hallegua, the last of the Paradesi, or 'foreign,' Jewish women in Kochi, left her nephew Keith as the last Jew there. Queenie Hallegua was the warden and managing trustee of the Paradesi Synagogue, a 450-year-old landmark, from 2012 to 2018. Queenie and her late husband Sammy hosted Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, when they came to the Paradesi Synagogue in 1997. She died on Aug. 11 at 89. Silvio Santos Silvio Santos, a son of Sephardic Jewish immigrants, rose from working-class roots to become one of Brazil’s wealthiest men and a popular television personality. Born in Rio de Janeiro, the former street vendor built a media empire, including SBT, one of Brazil’s top three television networks. Calling him 'Brazil’s first-ever celebrity billionaire,' Forbes magazine once compared him to Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg. He died on Aug. 17 at 93. Hersh Goldberg-Polin Hersh Goldberg-Polin moved with his family to Israel when he was a child and became a symbol of the plight of Israelis held hostage in Gaza after Hamas terrorists abducted him from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023. His parents, Rachel Goldberg-Polin and Jon Polin, became prominent advocates for bringing the hostages home, sharing frequently and eloquently about their son, whom they described as a wise, inquisitive, kind and gentle soul who was an engine of justice in the family and beyond. He and five other hostages — Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Alex Lubnov and Carmel Gat — were killed as Israeli troops closed in on the tunnel below Rafah where they had been held; they were 23, 24, 25, 27, 33 and 40 years old when their bodies were recovered on Aug. 31. 'I no longer worry about you,' Rachel Goldberg-Polin said at her son’s funeral. 'I know you are no longer in danger.' Mark Podwal In Mark Podwal’s illustrations — created for children’s books, major newspapers, synagogue tapestries and gallery walls — he devised a Jewish visual vocabulary that made him one of the best known Jewish artists of his era. He also became the only working dermatologist whose works on paper are included in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Modern and Contemporary Art Collection. He died on Sept. 13 at 79. Fania Brantsovsky Fania Brantsovsky was the last surviving member of the Jewish underground in the Vilna ghetto and a keeper of the flame of the city’s once-glorious Yiddish past. Brantsovsky escaped the ghetto in 1942 and fought against the Nazis and their local collaborators in the Rudninkai forest with a group of Jewish partisans under the command of Abba Kovner. In the years after the war, she became a lifelong advocate for the memory of Lithuanian Jewry and their Yiddish language. She died on Sept. 22 at 102. Lily Ebert A Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor, Lily Ebert went on to educate millions on TikTok and cultivate a late-in-life friendship with King Charles III. After surviving Auschwitz and living in Switzerland and Israel, Ebert eventually moved to Britain in 1967. She gave testimony at museums and universities and co-wrote a book about her experience with Dov Forman, one of 38 great-grandchildren among her descendants. With Forman, she co-created a TikTok account to educate social media users about the Holocaust and the prevalence of antisemitism. Forman was 16 at the time they created the account in 2021; at the time of her death, it had 2 million followers. Ebert died on Oct. 9 at 100. Lynda Obst Lynda Obst, a film producer whose credits include 'Interstellar,' 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,' 'Contact,' 'One Fine Day' and 'Sleepless in Seattle,' was an editor at The New York Times magazine before going to Hollywood in the late 1970s. She produced her friend Nora Ephron’s directorial debut, 'This Is My Life' (1992), and was the executive producer for Ephron’s wildly successful romantic comedy 'Sleepless in Seattle' in 1993. She became deeply engaged with Judaism while helping her son recover from addiction. She died on Oct. 22 at 74. Bernie Marcus Bernie Marcus, the billionaire who co-founded Home Depot, became a Republican megadonor and supporter of civic and political causes in the United States and Israel. Marcus’ legacy includes the transformation of downtown Atlanta with the establishment of the Georgia Aquarium; a massive advance in autism awareness and research thanks to the Marcus Autism Center, also in Atlanta; and the founding of the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem, an important think tank focused on governance. In his final years, he directed his energies toward combating antisemitism on college campuses. He died on Nov. 4 at 95. Felice Gaer For over 30 years, Felice Gaer Baran directed the American Jewish Committee’s Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights, assuring Jews a seat at the table in global debates around torture, political repression, LGBT rights and antisemitism. As head of the only human rights division within a major Jewish organization, Gaer (who used her maiden name professionally) witnessed gratifying success in advocating for women’s rights, torture victims and the protection of political dissidents around the world. She died on Nov. 9 at 78.

Israeli forces destroy Hezbollah compound in Southern Lebanon	Several weapons storage facilities were located, including one embedded inside a mosque, where hundreds of explosives, rifles, grenades and more military equipment were being stored. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli forces destroyed an underground Hezbollah command and control facility in Southern Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces said on Wednesday night. Engineering troops from the 91st Division’s 188th Brigade located a tunnel dozens of meters long that led to the command center, which according to the military was used by the Iranian proxy to plan attacks and direct rocket fire at Israeli communities in the Galilee over the past year. Weapons, surveillance systems and additional military equipment were confiscated during the operation. Nearby, several weapons storage facilities were located, including one embedded inside a mosque, where hundreds of explosives, rifles, grenades and more military equipment were being stored. After soldiers from Yahalom, a special forces unit of the Combat Engineering Corps, investigated the compound, engineering troops destroyed the command center and tunnel. The IDF emphasized that 188th Brigade troops 'continue to act to remove threats in Southern Lebanon in accordance with the understandings between Israel and Lebanon and the conditions of the ceasefire.' On Tuesday, an IDF aircraft struck a Hezbollah terrorist in Southern Lebanon he was observed loading weapons into a car. The IDF stressed that the Iranian-backed terror group’s presence in the area 'violated the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.' Earlier on Tuesday, the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese daily Al Akhbar reported that a drone had struck a vehicle in the village of Majdal Zoun. According to the report, two people were wounded in the strike. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal reached with Beirut on Nov. 26, Israeli forces are to withdraw gradually from the country over a 60-day period. Hezbollah must retreat north of the Litani River, about 20 miles north of the border, while the Lebanese Armed Forces deploy along the 75-mile frontier, along with monitors from the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL. On Monday, the IDF announced that after three months in Lebanon, its 98th Division was redeploying to the Gaza Strip. The military said that the division had dismantled more than 300 Hezbollah sites in Lebanon. Israeli ground forces entered Southern Lebanon in early October after a year of incessant Hezbollah rocket, suicide drone and missile attacks.

Breakthrough for bioengineering as study deciphers how cells defi...	Understanding how transcription factors navigate chromatin could enable scientists to bioengineer adult cells into other cell types. By Pesach Benson, TPS Research released on Wednesday by Israeli and Scottish scientists sheds new light on how cells establish their specialized roles, with findings likely to transform regenerative medicine and cell therapy. Researchers from Jerusalem’s Hebrew University and the University of Edinburgh uncovered how transcription factors (TFs) — critical proteins responsible for regulating gene activity — navigate complex DNA and chromatin structures to define cellular identity. The findings were published in the peer-reviewed Nature Journal. Understanding how transcription factors navigate chromatin could enable scientists to bioengineer adult cells into other cell types. For example, skin cells could potentially be reprogrammed into heart cells to treat an organ failure, or into insulin-producing beta cells to treat diabetes. The knowledge could also help identify chromatin-related gene regulation errors that cause developmental disorders, enabling early diagnosis and more targeted interventions. 'By uncovering how transcription factors interact with chromatin architecture, we can better understand gene regulation and cellular identity. This knowledge opens exciting possibilities for regenerative medicine, enabling us to precisely control cell fate and develop therapies for diseases caused by cellular dysfunction,' said Hebrew University’s Prof. Yosef Buganim, who led the research with Edinburgh University’s Dr. Abdenour Soufi. Transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression, directing cells to differentiate into specific types, such as skin, muscle, or placenta cells. While their ability to recognize DNA sequences is well-established, the exact mechanism behind their target selection within the vast genome has remained elusive. The study introduces a novel 'guided search' mechanism, revealing how the 3D structure of DNA and chromatin acts as a roadmap for TFs. By leveraging advanced technologies, the researchers explored how TF combinations influence distinct cell identities, focusing on embryo and placenta cells. They found that transcription factors dynamically cooperate or compete based on the chromatin landscape to target genes essential for cell type determination. One key discovery was the influence of chromatin topology, which refers to the folding and looping of DNA within the nucleus. These structures guide TFs along DNA pathways or concentrate them at chromatin junctions densely packed with critical DNA motifs. The findings also open new doors on enhancing gene-editing techniques such as CRISPR.

U.S. will not sanction Smotrich, Ben-Gvir – report	Knowing that the incoming administration would reverse the decision played a large part in dropping the idea. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The U.S. will not sanction either Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich or National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir before President Biden leaves office in January, The Times of Israel reported Thursday. The two nationalist-religious ministers have almost been persona non grata for the Biden administration due to the roles they have been accused of playing in Judea and Samaria. Smotrich has constantly threatened the financial stability of the Palestinian Authority in his economic position, and allegedly prevented moves against unauthorized outposts as minister in the Defense Ministry in charge of settler affairs. Ben-Gvir has allegedly directed the Israel Police, who are under his ministry’s purview, to ignore Jews’ attacks on Palestinians in the region, which have totaled a few dozen over the course of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. President Joe Biden signed an executive order in February allowing severe financial sanctioning of those 'enforcing or failing to enforce policies' that 'threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West Bank,' or who participate in such actions. Included in these were 'threats or acts of violence targeting civilians' and destruction of property. Mention was specifically made of 'high levels of extremist settler violence' which 'undermines the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution.' Palestinian terrorism was not mentioned, although there have been thousands of Palestinian attacks and attempted attacks throughout Judea and Samaria over the past year alone, some lethal. The only entities and individuals to be sanctioned to date for 'undermining' American objectives have been 17 Jewish settlers and 16 organizations that support the settlement enterprise. Although some Administration officials and dozens of Congress members have felt that Smotrich and Ben-Gvir are prime candidates for sanctions, a view echoed by top EU and British officials in recent months, the move was never made. An American official told the Israeli outlet that the president had been against it because he felt that penalizing ministers of a democratic ally would be going too far, and then when elections neared it became too much of a political hot potato to touch. Once Donald Trump won, the administration knew that he would reverse the decision very quickly, so it did not pay to make the move anymore. Trump could also decide to cancel the order completely, as it is any president’s prerogative to do with such executive actions, and restore all its victims’ financial rights.

‘Until Gaza is free’ – Defiant Houthis pledge more attacks on Isr...	Houthi-launched ballistic missile sends 2 million Israelis into bomb shelters, destroys elementary school near Tel Aviv. By World Israel News Staff Houthi terrorists in Yemen said on Thursday morning that they had fired two ballistic missiles at central Israel hours earlier, claiming that the launches marked a victory for the Shia-aligned anti-Israel proxy groups in the region. 'The operation has successfully achieved its objectives,' read a statement published by Yemen’s state news agency, Saba. The statement claimed that the missile attack had occurred 'simultaneously' with Israeli airstrikes on Houthi-controlled ports, energy infrastructure, and oil facilities. 'The Israeli aggression will not deter Yemen and the Yemenis from performing their religious and moral duty in responding to its massacres in the Gaza Strip,' the Houthis said. At around 2:30 AM on Thursday, the Houthis fired at least one missile at Israel, triggering air raid sirens that sent some 2 million people into bomb shelters. Although the IDF said the missile was intercepted, an elementary school in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan was completely destroyed. Education Minister Yoav Kisch told Hebrew-language media that he believed the educational institution had suffered a direct hit from the missile, while military officials claimed that the extensive damage was caused by shrapnel from the interception. Minutes after the missile was launched, Israel struck three major ports and other strategic infrastructure, killing at least nine people. In a media statement, Hamas condemned Israel's bombing of Yemen, which also blamed Jerusalem for the recent ouster of the Assad regime in Syria. 'We regard this escalation as a dangerous development and an extension of the aggression against our Palestinian people, Syria and the Arab region,' the terror group said. In a separate statement, Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, urged the Houthis to continue their aggression against the Jewish State. 'We commend the missile attack carried out by our loyal brothers, the Ansar Allah in Yemen, targeting the heart of the Zionist entity,' they said. The Houthis are the last remaining Iranian proxy group in the region that has not been significantly battered by the IDF. Recent months have seen the Hezbollah and Hamas terror groups, which are funded by Iran, suffer serious blows to their leadership, operatives, and capability to attack Israel. Since November, it's believed that the Houthis have launched at least a dozen explosive drones and missiles at the Jewish State.

Is a hostage deal imminent?	Hamas officials have told Arab outlets that the main issues have been resolved; diplomats say there’s a way to go. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News There are conflicting reports over whether a hostage deal is 'imminent,' as Hamas officials have labeled it in recent days. Lebanese paper Al-Akhbar reported Thursday that according to Hamas officials, 'The state of the negotiations underway in Doha is excellent, and most of the issues in dispute have been resolved, so it is possible that we will very soon have an agreement.' Israeli negotiators have been talking with Hamas and American officials in Qatar since Monday, with CIA director Bill Burns flying in on Wednesday. Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Awsat reported Wednesday that Hamas officials have said an agreement was 'imminent' and could be signed by the end of the week. The London-based paper said that in the first of three stages, lasting 45-60 days, Hamas would free about 30 hostages, both alive and dead. The Saudi Al-Hadath TV channel cited sources saying that the ill, elderly, and all female hostages, including soldiers, would be included in this stage. In exchange, the IDF would leave Gazan cities, northern Gaza residents would be allowed to return home and Israel would release an as-yet unknown number of Palestinian prisoners, although it is reportedly in the hundreds. At this stage, some reports stated that the IDF would still stay in the vital Philadelphi Corridor on the Egyptian-Gazan border, through and under which Hamas received the vast majority of its arms, and the Netzarim Corridor that the IDF created for security reasons and divides Gaza roughly in half. A Hamas official told AFP that the army would 'partly withdraw' from these by-now well-paved and wide roads, which in the case of Netzarim is also dotted with watchtowers. Hamas has reportedly agreed that a full IDF withdrawal from the coastal enclave can remain for the last stage of the deal. According to Al-Akhbar, disagreement still remains over Israel’s demand for a comprehensive list of both the living and dead hostages, with Hamas saying that it cannot hand one over until there is a week of quiet so that they can reach the abductees and confirm their status. A second point of reported contention is that Israel wants wounded male soldiers to be released in the first stage, while Hamas wants to hold all male soldiers for the second stage, in which the remaining dead bodies would also be released. Along with another batch of Palestinian prisoners, at least a hundred terrorists 'with long-term sentences' would be freed by Israel at this stage, the AFP report stated. Terrorists approved for release but who are serving heavy sentences for their lethal attacks would reportedly be deported to Qatar and Turkey, and not return to the Gaza Strip as Hamas originally demanded. Negotiations are simultaneously taking place in Cairo, with Egyptian security sources saying that one sticking point is that Hamas is demanding international guarantees that the temporary ceasefire will lead to a permanent end to the war in the third stage. While top Israeli government officials such as Defense Minister Yisrael Katz have said the two sides are closer than ever, and Washington has expressed 'cautious optimism,' diplomats involved with the talks have cautioned against believing that it is only a short step away. A source told The Jerusalem Post Wednesday that Hamas has not given the Israelis either a list of those the terror organization is ready to free, or one with the names of the prisoners it wants in exchange. None of the international guarantors mentioned by the Hamas official to AFP – Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, the UN and the U.S. – confirmed their participation, the news agency said.

Netanyahu reassures mother of US journalist kidnapped in Syria	In a personal letter to Austin Tice's mother, Netanyahu says Israel is acting with caution and concerned about her son's life. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a letter to the mother of an American journalist missing in Syria since 2012, promising her that Israel is refraining from bombing areas where he might be located. Austin Tice, a former U.S. Marine, was kidnapped more than 12 years ago after traveling to Syria to cover the civil war. After the fall of the Assad regime, Tice's family has been desperate to learn more about their son's whereabouts. The Tice family is under the impression that Austin is still alive. He was last seen blindfolded and bound in a 2012 video, while being led away by men dressed in Islamist garb. Speculation has been raised that Tice was actually kidnapped by the Assad regime, and that the video was created in order to give the false impression he was kidnapped by Islamic terrorists. Tice's mother, Debra, penned an open letter to Netanyahu, expressing her concern that the Israeli Air Force may bomb a neighborhood of Damascus where she believes her son is being held. She wrote that the family had received 'credible information' that her son is incarcerated at Mt. Qasioun prison, a secret facility near the Al-Mailki district. 'We urgently request you pause strikes on this area and deploy Israeli assets to search for Austin Tice and other prisoners,' Tice wrote. 'Time is of the essence. We are calling on you to leverage all your relationships and resources to liberate that prison.' In a personal letter to Debra Tice, Netanyahu said that he 'cannot imagine the depth of your concern over your son Austin's life and wellbeing.' Netanyahu urged her to 'stay strong,' saying that he admired her resilience . 'Please rest assured that Israel and its intelligence agencies are fully coordinated with the relevant American authorities on the matter and that the IDF is not active in the area where Austin may be located,' he added. Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Washington was in contact with Syrian rebel groups regarding Tice's whereabouts. 'We have impressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,' Blinken said.

IAF strikes Yemen as Houthis fire missile at central Israel	Nine said killed in IAF bombing of Houthi-controlled ports, oil facilities. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli Air Force struck numerous Houthi-controlled assets in Yemen, including major ports and oil sites, during the early hours of Thursday morning, as the terror group launched a ballistic missile that triggered sirens throughout central Israel. The IAF said in a statement that it 'conducted precise strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen, including ports and energy infrastructure in Sanaa.' According to the IAF, jets were already en route to Yemen when the Houthis fired a ballistic missile at 2:30 AM that sent at least 2 million Israelis into bomb shelters. Although the missile launched at Israel was intercepted, shrapnel from the projectile caused extensive damage in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. A school in the Ramat Efal neighborhood was apparently struck by a large piece of debris, causing a building to collapse. There were no casualties. The sites struck by the IAF include three major ports in the Hodeida area, which had previously been targeted by Israel following a deadly Houthi-launched drone attack in July 2024. 'Attacking these targets harms the terrorist authorities by preventing the exploitation of infrastructure for military and terror purposes, including transferring Iranian weaponry to the region,' the military said. 'The long arm of Israel will reach you,' Defense Minister Israel Katz said. 'Whoever lifts a hand will have it severed. Whoever strikes [us], will be struck many times over.' Al Masirah TV, a Houthi-affiliated news outlet, reported that nine people were killed in the overnight bombing. Seven were said to have been killed at the Port of Salif, while another two were killed at the Ras Issa oil refinery. In recent weeks, the Houthis have stepped up their attacks on Israel. On December 16th, the Houthis launched a ballistic missile at central Israel, which was intercepted. That attack caused no damage or injuries. Since November, the Houthis have fired around a dozen explosive drones and missiles at Israel. On December 9th, an explosive drone impacted an apartment building in Yavne, causing extensive damage but no casualties.

Houthi missile attack destroys central Israel elementary school	Ramat Gan mayor says it was 'great luck' that missile fired overnight, and not during school hours. By World Israel News Staff An elementary school in a Tel Aviv suburb was seriously damaged in the early hours of Thursday morning, as Houthi terrorists launched a ballistic missile at central Israel around 2:30 AM. Although the missile was said to be intercepted, Ramat Efal Elementary School, located in Ramat Gan, sustained such severe damage that a building collapsed. No casualties were reported. Nearby cars and homes were also damaged in the attack. Footage from the scene circulating on social media showed a building with its wall blown off, exposing the classroom inside. Partially collapsed roofs, shattered glass, and scattered debris are also seen. The damage may have come from a large piece of shrapnel from the missile, or it may have been that an unexploded warhead struck the school. Last month, an interception only partially destroyed the warhead of a Hezbollah missile, with the explosive load impacting in Ramat Gan. Ramat Efal Elementary School will not be operational until further notice and its students will need to learn elsewhere, Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shama HaCohen said in a statement. 'This night ended with great luck for the residents of the city of Ramat Gan. As the mayor and as the father of a child at Ramat Efal Elementary School, I do not want to think about a situation in which this missile would have been fired during school hours,' Shama HaCohen said. 'Teams from the municipality are on the ground and conducting a damage assessment, as well as initial clean-up of the scene.' The Ramat Gan municipality said in a statement that students in 1st through 4th grade, including special education students, will learn in nearby schools. Students in 5th and 6th grades will attend classes online.

Halevy: 'We are dismantling Hamas and targeting its infrastructure and forces to ensure that there will never be another October 7.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During a situational assessment in Rafah on Wednesday, IDF Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said continued military operations will pressure Hamas to return the 100 hostages remaining in Gaza and will create the optimal security situation to allow residents of border communities to return home. He made the situational assessment alongside alongside senior commanders, including Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and Gaza Division Commander Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram. 'We are dismantling Hamas and targeting its infrastructure and forces to ensure that there will never be another October 7,' Halevi said. 'We are applying daily pressure on Hamas, driving it into greater distress, to secure the return of the 100 hostages—hopefully alive—and for those who are not, to give them a proper burial in Israel.' The IDF activities were also designed to ensure the safe return of Gaza border community residents. 'As residents return, our responsibility grows even greater—not smaller. It is our duty to establish a far stronger security framework, ensuring they can feel safe and secure here,' Halevy said. He thanked the troops for their sacrifice saying,'You are playing a crucial role in the fight against Hamas, the return of the hostages, and the rebuilding of these communities. This knowledge gives me immense strength to continue, and I believe it is a shared mission for every soldier in the IDF—active and reserve alike. Keep up the incredible work. Thank you. Israeli forces will remain in the Gaza Strip after the current war with the Hamas terror organization ends, Israel’s defense chief Israel Katz announced Tuesday, emphasizing that the IDF will be responsible for the long-term security control of the coastal enclave. 'After we defeat Hamas’ military and governmental power in Gaza, Israel will have security control over Gaza with full freedom of action, just as it does in Judea and Samaria,' Katz said. 'We will not allow any terrorist organization to threaten Israeli communities and Israeli citizens from Gaza.'

Swiss Parliament votes to outlaw Hezbollah	The move sends a powerful message that there is no place for terrorist organizations in a just and secure world,' wrote the European Jewish Congress. By JNS Switzerland on Tuesday voted to outlaw Lebanon’s Hezbollah terrorist organization, in a rare move for the historically neutral country. The ban passed the lower house of the Swiss Parliament by 126-20 with 41 abstentions, after being approved in the upper house last week, according to Reuters. It has not been established when the ban will take effect. Proponents argued that Hezbollah was a 'threat to international security' and that the decision would allow Switzerland to 'take a stand against terrorism.' Opponents—including the Swiss government—argued that the ban would violate Switzerland’s commitment to neutrality, according to the report. 'If Switzerland now moves to ban such organizations with special laws, we must ask ourselves where and how the boundaries are drawn,' said Justice Minister Beat Jans during the parliamentary debate. Jewish groups applauded the move. 'We warmly welcome Switzerland’s decision to outlaw Hezbollah,' wrote the European Jewish Congress. 'The move sends a powerful message that there is no place for terrorist organizations in a just and secure world.' They added that the decision was 'particularly significant for Jewish communities' and Israel due to the ongoing threat posed by the terrorist group. The move comes a week after the Swiss parliament approved a five-year ban on the Hamas terrorist group in response to its brutal massacre in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The European country had previously only banned Al Qaeda and Islamic State, which are on the United Nations’ list of designated terrorist organizations.

Half of Israeli Arabs feel ‘shared destiny’ with Jewish populatio...	Israel’s 2.08 million Arabs make up 21.1% of the country’s population, according to figures released by the Central Bureau of Statistics in May. By Pesach Benson, TPS One in two Israeli-Arab citizens believe that the war has created a sense of 'shared destiny' with the Jewish population, a survey released on Wednesday found. The study, conducted by the Konrad Adenauer Program for Jewish-Arab Cooperation at Tel Aviv University’s Moshe Dayan Center reveals a significant shift in Arab-Jewish relations in Israel. According to the findings, 57.8% of Arab citizens now feel a sense of shared destiny with their Jewish counterparts. The finding marks a dramatic change from a year ago, when 69.8% of Arab respondents said the conflict had weakened solidarity between the two communities. 'The war between Israel and Hamas, the longest in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has profoundly impacted Arab public attitudes. Yet, amidst the turmoil, we see Arab citizens signaling their willingness to collaborate with the Jewish majority in rebuilding society and politics in the post-war era,' said Dr. Arik Rudnitzky, project manager of the Konrad Adenauer Program. Israel’s 2.08 million Arabs make up 21.1% of the country’s population according to figures released by the Central Bureau of Statistics in May. One of the survey’s most striking insights concerns the identity of Arab Israelis. When asked about the most significant component of their personal identity, 33.9% of respondents chose Israeli citizenship, surpassing religious affiliation (29.2%) and Arab identity (26.9%). Only 9% cited Palestinian identity as their primary identifier. 'This is a pivotal shift,' Rudnitzky explained. 'The upheavals and turbulence in the Middle East over the past year—ranging from the prolonged war with Hezbollah in Lebanon to the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria—have boosted Arab citizens’ appreciation for their Israeli citizenship. While Arab Israelis have not abandoned their Arab or Palestinian national identity, their focus on Israeli citizenship signals a willingness to play a more active role in shaping the future of Israeli society.' He added, 'The prominence of Israeli citizenship may also reflect the instrumental value it holds during times of crisis. For many, it represents stability and access to rights and opportunities, especially in a region marked by conflict.' The survey also explored Israeli-Arab opinions on post-war governance in Gaza. Responses were varied: 20.7% supported a Palestinian Authority-led administration, 20.1% preferred a multinational force, and 17.9% suggested Israeli control. Local Gazan entities received 15.8% support, while only 6.7% backed continued Hamas governance. Discussing these findings, Rudnitzky said, 'Arab citizens are looking for pragmatic solutions in Gaza that can bring stability, but the lack of consensus reflects the complexity of the situation. The responses highlight a diverse range of opinions within the Arab public, which mirrors the broader uncertainties about Gaza’s future.' Despite these divisions, the survey found that 71.8% of Arab Israelis support the inclusion of an Arab party in the Israeli government after the next elections. Nearly half (47.8%) expressed willingness to join any coalition, not just a center-left one. 'This level of support for Arab political participation is unprecedented,' Rudnitzky remarked. 'It signals a readiness to engage more actively in the political sphere and contribute to rebuilding Israeli society after the war. Arab citizens are clearly stating they want a seat at the table.' Asked about personal safety, majority (65.8%) of respondents reported feeling unsafe. However, 63.1% attributing this to surging criminal violence in Arab communities while 24.6% pointed to the impact of the war. In 2023, a record number of 244 Israeli-Arabs were murdered, more than double the 120 homicides in 2022. The surging violence continued to with 205 Israeli-Arabs murdered in 2024 so far. The spike in violence is attributed to organized crime groups fighting turf battles and trying to eliminate rivals. Arab criminal organizations have been involved in extortion, money laundering, and trafficking in weapons, drugs and women. Crime, more than any other issue, 'is eroding the sense of personal security among Arab citizens. The government must prioritize this if it hopes to strengthen Arab-Jewish relations further,' Rudnitzky said. At the same time, respondents demonstrated optimism about regional developments. Over half (53.4%) viewed a potential normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia as a positive step, while 49.2% believed resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should not be a precondition for such an agreement. 'Under the dark shadow cast by the war over all citizens of Israel, both Arabs and Jews, we are seeing indications of significant change. A sense of shared destiny is sprouting between Arabs and Jews that could redefine the rules of the game in the post-war era,' said Rudnitzky. 'This is a clear and hopeful message. Arab citizens are ready to contribute, to engage, and to redefine their role within Israeli society. It’s a message that the authorities and the Jewish majority must hear and act upon.'

‘This mission brings hope’: Israeli, African doctors collaborate ...	Founded at the Wolfson Medical Center in 1995, Save a Child’s Heart has saved the lives of more than 7,000 children from 70 countries and has brought over 150 local healthcare professionals to Israel for training. By Pesach Benson, TPS A delegation of Israeli medical personnel in Zambia is in the middle of a marathon series of life-saving operations on 25 children with congenital heart defects. 'We are delighted to welcome an international team to the National Heart Hospital. The exchange of knowledge and expertise is invaluable, and we sincerely thank Save a Child’s Heart Israel for their commitment to training both our team and the visiting professionals,' said Dr. Chabwela Shumba, Senior Medical Superintendent at Zambia’s National Heart Hospital in Lusaka. The mission, organized by Save a Child’s Heart, an Israeli humanitarian organization, also brought experts from neighboring Tanzania for the open heart surgeries and catheterizations taking place from Dec. 16-20. Leading the cardiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, ICU specialists, technicians, and nurses are performing open-heart surgeries and catheterization procedures. Leading the effort are Dr. Godwin Godfrey Sharau of Tanzania, Dr. Mudaniso Kumani Ziwa of Zambia, both trained by Save a Child’s Heart in Israel, and Dr. Lior Sasson, Director of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery at Israel’s Wolfson Medical Center. 'Too many children in Africa suffer and die from treatable heart conditions. This mission brings hope by enabling us to save lives and share knowledge, ensuring that children in Zambia receive care closer to home. Our Tanzanian team from JKCI are proud to be part of this important mission and share the knowledge and skills gained over our own 10+ year journey in pediatric cardiac care,' Sharau said. In addition to the open-heart surgeries, a specialized team will visit Zambia to perform catheterizations. These advanced procedures allow for the repair of heart defects in children without the need for open-heart surgery. 'It is incredibly rewarding to see the doctors we trained in Israel now leading life-saving missions and building sustainable cardiac care programs in their home countries,' said Sasson, who has been training African doctors for 15 years. 'The specialized training they received at Wolfson Medical Center has empowered them to perform complex heart surgeries and train others, creating a ripple effect that extends far beyond Israel. Witnessing the successful collaboration of these skilled professionals, who were once our trainees and are now leaders in global pediatric cardiac care, fills me with pride and hope for the future of children with heart disease around the world,' he said. Founded at the Wolfson Medical Center in 1995, Save a Child’s Heart has saved the lives of more than 7,000 children from 70 countries and has brought over 150 local healthcare professionals to Israel for training. Since 2017, the organization has worked closely with Zambia’s Ministry of Health to strengthen pediatric cardiac care in the African country. This partnership has led to the treatment of over 100 Zambian children and the training of numerous medical professionals. 'This mission represents the best of international cooperation and humanitarian commitment. Israel’s dedication to training medical professionals and sharing life-saving expertise underscores our deep belief in the power of partnerships to create a healthier, more compassionate world. We are proud to see this collaboration bring hope and healing to children and families in Zambia and beyond,' said Israeli Ambassador to Zambia Ofra Farhi. Dr. Chabwela Shumba, Senior Medical Superintendent at the National Heart Hospital praised the international collaboration. 'The exchange of knowledge and expertise is invaluable, and we sincerely thank Save a Child’s Heart for their commitment to training and equipping our team. This partnership is instrumental in building Zambia’s capacity to deliver world-class cardiac care and establish our center as a focal point in Sub-Saharan Africa.'

Israel allocating $64m for tourism projects, including in Judea a...	In recent months, the ministry reviewed 119 applications, representing a total requested investment of approximately $446 million. By Amelie Botbol, JNS The Israeli Ministry of Tourism will allocate approximately 230 million shekels ($64 million) to 55 tourism projects across the country. This will include $6 million in Judea and Samaria, the highest budget for the region in the last five years, and $18 million in the country’s north. 'On assuming my role as tourism minister, I decided to increase investment in the Judea and Samaria region, the biblical heartland of Israel, with its rich history, stunning landscapes and natural beauty,' Tourism Minister Haim Katz told JNS on Tuesday. 'Judea and Samaria are a magnet for Jewish and Christian tourists alike. With this significant financial investment in tourism projects in the region, the Tourism Ministry is working to improve the visitor experience, to make history accessible and increase the lodging options in the area,' he continued. 'As we work toward the ‘day after [the war],’ we are focusing our attention on the faith-based market, which continues to prove loyal to Israel. We invite you to show your support for Israel by planning your next visit within the coming year,' Katz said. The ministry’s allocation is part of a total investment of approximately $114 million in the approved projects, which include an ecological promenade in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, laser shows at the marina in Eilat and the citadel in the Knights’ Halls in Acre, and a walk-on-water experience in Kibbutz Ginosar on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. In Judea and Samaria, projects include accessibility improvements at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, the establishment of an archaeological park in Beit El in the Binyamin region, and the creation of a Psalms Trail segment and park project in Mount Hebron. 'We have distributed the investment across the country,' said Ministry of Tourism Director-General Dani Shahar. Ninety-eight local authorities responded to the ministry’s invitation to submit requests for funding. In recent months, the ministry reviewed 119 applications, representing a total requested investment of approximately $446 million. 'The ministry evaluated the projects based on criteria such as potential to attract visitors from Israel and overseas, proximity to existing or planned accommodations, alignment with ministry and government policies, local authority’s ability to maintain the project, maintenance complexity, and diversification or enhancement of the tourism product,' Shahar said. 'The infrastructures we are creating will offer an unforgettable visitor experience in every place.'

Smotrich declares hostage deal would be a ‘mistake’ and urges ‘cr...	Smotrich: 'Hamas is at its weakest point since the war began. This is not the moment to offer it any reprieve.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Wednesday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich expressed strong opposition to the potential hostage-for-prisoner release deal. Smotrich told Kol Barama radio, 'Hamas is at its weakest point since the war began.' 'This is not the moment to offer it any reprieve. We must continue to apply pressure and defeat it, ensuring that the hostages are returned under terms that demonstrate its surrender, not ours,' he added. Smotrich continued, 'Deals that involve releasing hundreds of terrorist murderers, who will return to killing Jews, or agreements that see us withdrawing from northern Gaza and allowing a million Gazans to come back and undo the hard-earned progress we've made with so much bloodshed—those are grave mistakes.' 'If we weren't negotiating with Hamas and instead focused solely on targeting them with our sights, tank fire, airstrikes, and the efforts of our heroic fighters, the hostages would have been freed long ago.' Smotrich emphasized that he is fully aware this deal is 'bad, doesn't serve the State of Israel's goals or interests, nor does it lead to victory in the war. It also doesn't bring back the hostages because, in the end, it's only a partial agreement.' Despite earlier reports that Israel was 'closer than ever' to a hostage deal, Israeli officials have denied that an agreement is imminent. Israeli officials with firsthand knowledge of the ongoing talks between Israel and the Hamas terror group poured cold water on widely reported claims that the two sides are nearing a hostage deal. Speaking to Axios, three sources said that there are still major issues of contention between the parties. 'The gaps are still significant. There are gaps that the negotiation teams can bridge, and that is what they are trying to do now in Qatar. In any case, there is still a long way to go,' an Israeli official with knowledge of the talks told Axios. Another Israeli government insider slammed Hebrew-language media for publishing reports claiming that the parties are close to a deal. 'It doesn't help the negotiations. It misleads the public and creates false illusions,' the source said. A third Israeli official told Axios that 'a deal is not around the corner.'

Israeli activists established outpost inside Lebanon, says IDF	Israeli military acknowledges that Israeli settlement activists managed to cross the border into Lebanon and set up tens as part of a makeshift outpost 'settlement.' By World Israel News Staff A group of Israeli activists managed to cross the border from Israel into Lebanon and briefly establish a makeshift outpost 'settlement' on Lebanese territory, the IDF said Wednesday. The incident occurred on December 5th, when activists from the Uri Tzafon movement snuck across the Israel-Lebanon border and set up tents on the Lebanese side of the frontier, near Maroun El Ras. The settlement activists dubbed the outpost 'Mei Marom.' According to the movement's website, the outpost was established in honor of Staff Sergeant Yehuda Dror Yahalom, a 21-year-old Golani Reconnaissance soldier from Hebron who was killed during a battle with Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon in October. During their stay in southern Lebanon, the activists planted cedar trees at the site of the short-lived outpost. The IDF had initially denied the movement's claim that it had established an outpost on Lebanese soil. On Wednesday, however, following an internal probe, a spokesperson acknowledged that activists had in fact managed to cross the border and set up tents, but emphasized that the outpost was quickly dismantled by IDF forces. 'This is a very serious incident which will be investigated. Any attempt to near or cross the border into Lebanese territory which is not in coordination [with the army] presents a danger to life and harms the IDF's ability to operate in the area and fulfill its mission.' The Uri Tzafon activists spent several hours in Lebanese territory, and when confronted by IDF soldiers, left without incident. 'We arrived here in preparation for the establishment of a 'seed' group which will settle the area in the future,' Uri Tzafon said in a statement. 'Maroun El Ras was an ancient Hebrew community named Mei Marom. Yehuda fell in battle in Ayta ash Shab, a village where a group of Kohanim lived in the past. With God's help, we will yet return to all these areas in Lebanon, where Jews lived in the past.' Established in early 2024 in honor of IDF soldier Yisrael Socol, 24, who was killed battling terrorists in Gaza this January, Uri Tzafon claims over 3,000 members in its Whatsapp group. Prior to the Mei Marom incident earlier this month, Uri Tzafon has published material laying out its vision for Jewish settlement across southern Lebanon and organizing demonstrations in northern Israel and hikes near the Lebanese frontier. The group has also distributed flyers and leaflets to southern Lebanon via drones and balloons, encouraging locals to leave the area. 'Caution! This is the Land of Israel that belongs to Jews. You must evacuate it immediately,' the leaflets read, according to the far-left Jewish Currents.

IDF to establish five new reservist brigades for volunteers ages ...	So far, 3,000 of the planned 15,000 volunteers aged 38-58 have signed up for the David Division. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF is trying to establish a new division consisting of five reservist brigades as part of its efforts to shore up border security for the State of Israel, as one of the lessons learned from the Hamas-led surprise invasion of the southern part of the country last October 7. The nascent David Division will consist of volunteers aged 38-58 who would join the brigade closest to their communities and train in response methods so that they can prevent another such mass terror attack. The idea is that in case of sudden need, they could haul out uniforms and weapons, which would always be in their homes, and arrive quickly to the menaced area to deal with the threat. The IDF gave as an example 'a company that will protect the Kfar Yona area if terrorists breach the barrier wall around Tul Karem,' that could be 'activated immediately, put on uniforms, and deployed in defense.' Another admitted goal is 'to lighten the burden of those serving in the existing divisions,' as for example, the volunteers’ service can enable the new Eastern Division on the Jordanian border to carry out more security operations to prevent the rampant weapons smuggling of recent years. The five brigades will cover the borders of the Negev ('Negba'), Plains ('Yonatan'), the Valleys ('Yizraeli'), Jerusalem ('Ari'), and Galilee-Golan regions. They will be purely ground forces, with no armored element, but will include rocket launchers, sharpshooters and drone teams who can use the small aerial vehicles to locate and engage with the enemy. The army is searching for these once-and-future soldiers among veterans of combat engineer units, commandos, and infantry who have passed the necessary advanced courses to become riflemen of Grade 07 or higher, which includes marksmanship proficiency. It would like at least one Bedouin battalion (about 400-500 men), with four companies of its fighters residing in the Galilee and one in the Negev. Another special battalion in the Negev division will consist of Israeli Navy veterans, who are typically exempted from reserve duty once their mandatory service period is over. All the volunteers will have to pass a mental and physical health test, and have clean criminal record, among other criteria. Recruitment actually began nine months ago, but has been slow, with only some 3,000 of the necessary 15,000 volunteers having signed up to date. Six thousand others have expressed interest and 'we are in the process of getting to them,' the army said. The IDF is going to launch a campaign to entice more to join, it noted, with Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi saying that 'Although they are not of the official reserve age, they have the right spirit and understanding of the need.' On the army website describing the David Division, it says, 'Once a fighter, always a fighter!' It invites former officers and enlisted men and women to fill out forms that ask them, among other questions, to list their army profiles and what they did when they served if they were combat positions, and areas of expertise for those in combat support roles, such as training others, communications, and General Staff aides. Training is expected begin in 2025, and will include 'a course to refresh combat skills, combat exercises in built-up areas and complex scenarios, specialized training for commanders and professional positions, and training that will be conducted on an ongoing basis to maintain competency,' the army said.

Conspiracy theories link Syria’s new de facto leader to Israel’s ...	Critics of the Syrian rebel alliance that toppled President Assad this month push conspiracy theories linking Islamist chief to Israel's Mossad, with rumors that the Sunni fundamentalist with ties to Al Qaeda is actually Jewish. By World Israel News Staff The radical Sunni rebel commander who claimed de facto control over Syria earlier this month after deposing President Bashar Assad has found himself the target of rumors alleging he has a hidden Jewish background, that he is a secret Mossad agent, or even that he is actually the president of Ukraine in disguise. Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, known also as Abu Mohammad al-Julani, led the Islamist rebel force Tahrir al-Sham to victory of regime forces on December 8th, and subsequently declared himself leader of a new Syrian regime. Born in Saudi Arabia to a Syrian family from the Golan Heights, al-Sharaa joined the Al Qaeda terrorist organization in 2003 and actively fought against American forces in Iraq, before being captured. Upon his release in 2011, al-Sharaa established the Al Qaeda-aligned al-Nusra Front - a Sunni force formed to challenge the Alawite-Shi'ite regime of the Assad family in Syria. For years, al-Sharaa maintained ties with Al Qaeda, and was placed on the U.S. State Department's terrorist wanted list, before distancing himself from Al Qaeda in 2016. Despite his Muslim bona fides, following the capture of Damascus, critics of the Syrian rebels and supporters of the Assad regime have promoted rumors that al-Sharaa is Jewish - or at least of Jewish heritage - and that he is an active agent of Israel's Mossad, America's CIA, or both. 'Why is there no knowledge of Abu Muhammad al-Julani's family,' an Iranian X/Twitter handle named Dr. Shahla asked. 'Look it up and make sure. It is very likely that he will turn out to be like Abu Hafs, the preacher of the Libyan mosque, who turned out to be a Jewish officer in the Israeli Mossad.' Another user, operating under the moniker 'Roaring of the Syrian Revolution,' which has tens of thousands of followers, dubbed al-Sharaa a 'creation of the Mossad.' Others have even claimed al-Sharaa is actually Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, The Jerusalem Post reported. 'The terrorist Julani kept dressing, talking and taking pictures like the Jew Zelensky,' claimed Egyptian journalist Hossam al-Ghamry. 'And the media applauds him… Netanyahu is so happy with you.' 'This tells us that Mossad and CIA have a shortage of stylist jobs.' Still others compared the rebel chief to the late Israeli spy Eli Cohen, who managed to infiltrate Syria's military intelligence establishment in the 1960s before being uncovered and executed. 'Israeli Mossad: This is a spy we prepared well,' tweeted Egyptian jurist Salwa al-Soubi. A Danish economist-turned-politician, Mads Palsvig, posted a tweet on X claiming that al-Sharaa is Jewish, and was born as Yonatan Zvi David. The claim was viewed over two million times on X.

A $2,000 soccer ball for Hamas-friendly Qatar and a $1,500 bowl f...	Biden presented Al-Thani with the ball as Qatar faced enormous international pressure over mass human rights abuses in the lead up to World Cup games, which took place in stadiums built largely using forced labor from foreign workers. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon A $1,962 soccer ball for Hamas ally Qatar. A $1,557 bowl for Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping. A $2,310 handblown glass vase for Cambodian dictator Hun Sen. These are just some of the taxpayer-funded gifts the Biden-Harris administration awarded to foreign dictators, human rights abusers, and anti-American world leaders, financial disclosure forms reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon show. The administration doled out the gifts from October 2022 to September 2023, as President Joe Biden and his top cabinet members traveled the globe for diplomatic powwows. While it is customary for U.S. officials to present foreign leaders with gifts as a sign of goodwill, the Biden-Harris administration spent liberally on presents for some of the globe’s foremost human rights abusers. China’s Xi, for instance, received a $1,557.84 'custom glass bowl' during Biden’s travel in November 2022, according to non-public financial disclosure forms submitted to Congress this month and reviewed by the Free Beacon. The lavish bowl was packaged in a 'Navy gift box' and included 'hand-painted White House wood.' When Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to China in June 2023, he presented then-foreign affairs minister Qin Gang with a pewter tea set worth $1,345. The State Department sought special permission to purchase the gift because it exceeded the internal limit of $1,200 set under federal guidelines. During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, meanwhile, Biden presented the gulf state's emir, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani, with a $1,962 'custom leather presidential soccer ball.' The souvenir included the 'seal and signature of the president of the United States' and was bestowed in a 'custom leather presentation box with inscription.' Biden presented Al-Thani with the ball as Qatar faced enormous international pressure over mass human rights abuses in the lead up to World Cup games, which took place in stadiums built largely using forced labor from foreign workers. Qatar also remains one of Hamas’s top backers, supporting the terror group financially and providing its remaining leaders safe haven in Doha. Jordan’s anti-Israel regime, led by King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein, received upwards of $10,000 in gifts during multiple visits with Biden and his wife Jill. During his February 2023 visit to the United States, for example, the administration gifted Al-Hussein a 'ship’s bell double clock' that featured 'the president’s signature' and was valued at $1,912. He also received a $1,129 'custom handblown green glass bowl.' The administration presented Al-Hussein’s wife, Queen Rania Al Abdullah, with a 'custom handmade 14 karat yellow gold brooch' worth $854. First Lady Jill Biden presented the gift in a 'blue lacquer jewelry box' that featured 'the first lady’s signature.' In May 2023, during a trip to Jordan, Biden presented Al-Hussein with a $2,236 'custom leather stationery set' that included a 'custom hand-painted fountain pen made from White House wood.' On that same foreign jaunt, Jill Biden gave Jordan’s queen an '18 karat yellow gold diamond necklace' priced at $2,400. Cambodian dictator Sen, who served as the nation's prime minister until August 2023, received a $2,310 glass vase from Biden in November 2022. Around that time, Biden's State Department determined Sen's government was guilty of mass human rights crimes, including 'unlawful or arbitrary killings' of political opponents. A month later, during the 2022 U.S.-Africa Leader Summit in Washington, D.C., Biden gave South Sudan’s minister of foreign affairs, Mayiik Ayii Deng, a $1,936 gift package that included 'framed vintage American art' and other valuables. South Sudan is complicit in massive human rights atrocities that include 'extrajudicial executions, unlawful killings, [and] conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence,' according to Amnesty International. Prominent anti-Israel leaders also received luxury gifts. Moussa Faki Mahamat, chair of the African Union Commission, received 'framed vintage American art' and a 'pair of aviator sunglasses' valued at nearly $2,000. As the African Union’s top official, Mahamat has described Israel’s war against Hamas and Hezbollah as 'immoral and unacceptable,' saying the Jewish state is waging an 'unjust war against Palestinians.' Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan—a prominent anti-Israel figure who is said to have 'set back Turkey’s human rights record by decades'—received a $1,078 'men’s presidential watch' in July 2023, when Biden was in Lithuania for NATO meetings. Erdogan’s gift also included a 'pair of aviator sunglasses featuring the seal of the president of the United States.' Far-left Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who landed in hot water earlier this year for making a series of anti-Semitic remarks, received more than $3,000 in gifts from the Biden-Harris administration after taking office. Lula was given a 'steel democracy eagle sculpture' worth $1,123 in January, when a White House delegation attended his inauguration. He got a $2,000 'archivally printed peace treaty from the U.S. National Archives' in February of that year when he travelled to Washington for meetings.

Knesset mulls law to block establishment of a Palestinian state	An 80-MK majority would be needed to give up land or any Israeli territorial waters, or 61 MKs and a national referendum. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Land of Israel lobby in the Knesset is proposing a new bill for consideration by the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee to help prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. The law, in the form of an amendment to the Referendum Law, would require either a super-majority of 80 MKs to approve the transfer of territory, or an absolute majority of 61 of the 120 legislators plus a public referendum. Lobby heads MKs Yuli Edelstein (Likud), Limor Son Har-Malech (Otzma Yehudit) and Simcha Rotman (Religious Zionism) wrote a letter to the Committee, which Rotman heads, explaining their reasoning. 'There is broad agreement in Israeli society and in the Knesset that a Palestinian state should not be established,' they noted. 'On our initiative, the Knesset voted on a declaration against a Palestinian state by a large majority. The law that is being promoted is the practical expression of the Knesset's decision.' In July, the Knesset voted 68-9 on a resolution saying that such a state 'in the heart of the Land of Israel will pose an existential danger to the State of Israel and its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilize the region,' as it would soon be taken over by Hamas and turned into 'a radical Islamic terror base.' 'After October 7, the State of Israel will not allow terrorist groups to establish themselves on its borders and endanger the security of its citizens,' the letter continued. 'The Israel Security Law amends the Referendum Law, and brings all areas of the historic Land of Israel and territorial waters within the scope of the law.' 'We consider this amendment important and essential at this time and request that the discussion be scheduled as soon as possible,' they wrote. Judea and Samaria, the region that Israeli liberated in 1967’s Six Day War and which the Palestinians covet as their state, was a large part of the ancient kingdoms of Judea and Israel. The inclusion of Israel’s territorial waters in the terms is a reaction to the 2022 agreement demarcating the maritime boundaries between Israel and Lebanon that was approved solely by the Cabinet of then-prime minister Yair Lapid. In the deal, which each side signed with the United States and not with each other as they are technically still at war, Israel ceded hundreds of kilometers of disputed sea. According to the Opposition, Israel also gave up several kilometers of its actual territorial waters, a claim that Lapid denied, saying that only maritime territory in Israel’s economic sphere was included, not sovereign waters, and thus a national referendum or Knesset approval was unnecessary. Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara had ruled that the only legal requirement was a nonbinding review of the agreement by the Knesset. In all, 26 MKs signed onto the bill, including some from ultra-religious Shas and United Torah Judaism, and some members of the Israel Beiteinu and National Unity parties, which are in the Opposition. In 2018, the Knesset passed a similar law requiring a super-majority regarding giving up any part of Jerusalem. The 'United Jerusalem' amendment to the Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel, stated that 80 MKs must approve any government decision that includes the transfer of any part of the city to 'a foreign political or governing power&#8230;or foreign authority,' or changes its status in any way. In all negotiations with the Palestinians regarding the 'two-state solution,' they have demanded that eastern Jerusalem be transformed into the capital of their desired country.

Palestinian gunmen wound Israeli near Joseph’s Tomb	Last week, three Israelis were shot and lightly wounded on their way to pray at the Joseph’s Tomb compound. By JNS Palestinian terrorists overnight Tuesday shot and lightly wounded an Israeli bus driver bringing Jewish pilgrims to Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus (Shechem) in Samaria, according to Hebrew-language media. The gunmen reportedly opened fire on the bus as the driver was leaving the area after dropping off some two dozen pilgrims. The Israel Defense Forces dispatched troops to extract the driver and the pilgrims, who did not coordinate the trip in advance with the military. 22 חסידי ברלנד נכנסו באוטובוס לקבר יוסף בשכם, לבדם וללא תיאום עם הצבא. נהג האוטובוס הוריד אותם במקום ובדרכו החוצה מהעיר, מחבלים ירו לעברו ופצעו אותו באורח קל. צה'ל נכנס לקבר יוסף והוציא את החסידים, שהועברו יחד עם הנהג לטיפול המשטרה@carmeldangor pic.twitter.com/Ay9kv6iXN9 &mdash; כאן חדשות (@kann_news) December 18, 2024 Prior to Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, Orthodox Jews regularly visited Joseph’s Tomb under IDF protection, with clashes often breaking out during the visits. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Nablus, which is designated as Area A per the Oslo Accords (under full Palestinian Authority security and administrative control), without prior consent. Last week, three Israelis were shot and lightly wounded on their way to pray at the Joseph’s Tomb compound. The three men, members of the Breslov sect of Chassidic Judaism, had entered Nablus after driving through an Israeli military checkpoint and fled after being fired on, later seeking medical attention at Hadassah Mount Scopus Hospital, where police subsequently detained them. In June, a haredi Jew sustained minor wounds in a Palestinian attack as he tried to enter Nablus to pray at the tomb site on the outskirts of the city. In March, Jewish worshippers who entered Shechem to pray at Joseph’s Tomb were fired on as they exited the city.

Yeshiva University’s centennial Chanukah gala lights up the night	Donor support has surged, particularly since October 7, as contributors increasingly seek institutions that combine academic excellence with strong values. By Jewish Breaking News As a wave of antisemitism darkens college campuses nationwide, Yeshiva University is lighting the way forward, announcing a staggering $100 million fundraising triumph at its centennial Chanukah celebration on Monday. Drawing more than 500 supporters, YU’s landmark event marked 100 years since the university’s first Chanukah celebration in 1924. That inaugural celebration featured Albert Einstein, setting a precedent for distinguished guests that would later include vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, and President John F. Kennedy. YU’s recent growth has been remarkable, with more than twenty new degree programs launched and its graduate student population doubling. 'Hanukkah illuminates the idea that the seeds of redemption are sown in darkness. For over 100 years, Yeshiva University has been a beacon of light, rooted in academic excellence and a values-based education,' said YU President Ari Berman. 'Even in the face of profound challenges, we rise with courage and conviction to meet this unprecedented moment in history, empowering our students to bring hope, strength, and moral clarity to our society and our world. Tonight, we celebrate the unwavering dedication of those who make this vision possible and the promise of a brighter tomorrow for us all.' Donor support has surged, particularly since October 7, as contributors increasingly seek institutions that combine academic excellence with strong values. The $100 million raised brings the university’s campaign to $520 million, edging closer to its $613 million target. It will go a long way in supporting various exciting initiatives, including the school’s newly announced Honors Leadership Society. The evening honored several key figures, including longtime Board of Trustees member Chella Safra, who received an honorary doctorate. The Wilf Family, owners of the Minnesota Vikings and prominent philanthropists, were awarded the Centennial Medallion for their sustained support of Jewish education.

By World Israel News Staff Iran vowed Tuesday to continue its de facto war against Israel, despite major setbacks in the region, including the loss of its long-time ally in Syria, deposed President Bashar Assad. In a Hebrew tweet Tuesday night, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote that 'The enemies are imagining that after the recent developments in Syria, the uprising is already over. They are gravely mistaken.' Earlier on Tuesday, Khamenei's primary X/Twitter account posted an English message calling for the destruction of the State of Israel at the hands of Palestinian and Lebanese terrorists. 'God willing the Palestinian and Hezbollah fighters will see the day when the malevolent Zionist enemy is trampled under their feet.' 'We stand with the Palestinian fighters and the Hezbollah mujahideen who fight on the path of God. We support them and will help them in any way we can.' 'Zionist regime imagines it’s preparing itself by way of Syria to be able to surround Hezbollah forces. However, the one that will be uprooted is Israel.' Khamenei also took aim at the United States in one of his tweets Tuesday. 'Considering what’s happened in Syria, the crimes being committed by the Zionist regime and the US, they thought the Resistance is over. They are gravely mistaken.' The collapse of the Assad regime earlier this month reportedly has left Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on edge, with senior officials blaming each other for the removal of a key Iranian ally. The rebel victory also marked a major setback for Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy force, which earlier this year suffered blows to its leadership with a string of bombing attacks killing dozens and injuring thousands of officers, followed by airstrikes which assassinated Hezbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah and other top officials.

Argentina, Israel mark 75 years of diplomatic ties in Jerusalem	Argentina’s ambassador to Israel, Rabbi Axel Wahnish, said, 'Argentina was for 74 years a partner but now, in its 75th year, under president Milei Argentina has become a friend to Israel.' By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS Israel and Argentina on Monday marked 75 years of diplomatic relations at a gala event at the Israeli Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, as ties between the two countries reached unprecedented heights under Argentinian President Javier Milei. The event included a call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, some of whom are Argentinian nationals. In written remarks read out at the event by the South American country’s ambassador to Israel, the Argentinian leader pledged to continue speaking out against Islamic terrorism targeting the Jewish state, saying, 'silence is complicity.' Milei, who has pledged to move his country’s embassy to Jerusalem went on to write: 'The foundation of the relationship between Argentina and Israel is the value of freedom and democracy. In this regard, I have prioritized our bond with Israel, elevating it to an unprecedented level.' The South American leader, who took office last year, made one of his first official visits as president to Israel, where he reiterated his pledge to move the embassy to Jerusalem, visited southern Israeli communities hard-hit in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas massacre and met with Argentinian-born Israelis that had been freed from captivity in Gaza. 'Argentina was the first Latin American country to recognize the State of Israel,' noted Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the event. 'Now, under the leadership of my dear friend Javier Milei, there is no doubt that ties have become stronger than ever,' he added. From ‘partner to friend’ Argentina’s ambassador to Israel, Rabbi Axel Wahnish, said, 'Argentina was for 74 years a partner but now, in its 75th year, under president Milei Argentina has become a friend to Israel.' Wahnish has studied Torah with the libertarian Argentinian leader, a Catholic who has shown immense interest in Judaism. An iconoclast and political outsider, Milei was elected in November 2023 amid a burgeoning economic crisis and skyrocketing inflation that has long beleaguered the large South American country, which is making strides toward recovery under his leadership. A week after his election victory, he visited the United States for government meetings, stopping at the grave in New York of the late Lubavitcher Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. It was his third such visit that year. Since taking over, he has subsequently listed Hamas as a terror organization and called out Iran’s terrorism. 'The future of friendship between Israel and Argentina has never looked brighter,' said Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, whose Argentinian-born father immigrated to Israel 59 years ago, and who was in the audience. Israel’s top diplomat is scheduled to lead a private-sector delegation to Argentina in March to further economic ties between the two countries. Knesset speaker Amir Ohana, who visited Buenos Aires this fall and has invited Milei to address Israel’s parliament in Jerusalem, concurred. 'The bond between Argentina and Israel has never been stronger,' he said, adding, 'Times of crisis have a way of bringing heroes into focus. Milei’s Argentina has emerged as a booming moral voice shaking the world stage.'

Gazans sue Biden administration over Israeli arms sales	Five Palestinian Arabs sue the United States State Department, accusing it of ignoring alleged Israeli violations of American human rights laws, enabling continued arming of the Israeli military. By World Israel News Staff A group of Palestinian Arabs have filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration's State Department over American arms sales to the Israeli military. The suit was filed on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for Washington D.C. by a group of five Palestinian Arabs residing in the Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria, and the United States. The U.S.-based group DAWN - Democracy for the Arab World Now - helped organize the lawsuit. The lead plaintiff in the suit is a Gazan woman and former UNRWA employee who claims to have been displaced seven times since the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7th, and lost 20 family members in the conflict. Three others are Palestinian Arabs with U.S. citizenship, while the fifth is Shawan Jabarin, director of the Palestinian NGO Al-Haq and an activist with ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terror organization. In the court filing Tuesday, attorneys for the plaintiffs accused the State Department of knowingly circumventing the so-called 'Leahy Law' - a pair of amendments passed in 1997 and 1998 which bar the U.S. from arming foreign units credibly accused of gross human rights violations. The law was amended again in 2019, mandating that the State Department vet foreign units slated to receive American weaponry for possible human rights violations. The plaintiffs' attorneys argue that by allegedly ignoring the Leahy Law, the State Department can be sued under the Administrative Procedure Act. 'The State Department's calculated failure to apply the Leahy Law is particularly shocking in the face of the unprecedented escalation of Israeli gross violations of human rights since the Gaza War erupted on October 7, 2023,' the court filing reads in part. 'The International Court of Justice has issued provisional orders to Israel to stop depriving Palestinians in Gaza of items essential to their survival, finding that its actions are plausibly genocidal.' The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for [gross violations of human rights].'

Democrats pressure Biden to impose arms embargo on Israel	With just over a month left in office, Democratic lawmakers are lobbying President Joe Biden to impose a sweeping arms embargo on Israel. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden is facing calls from within his own party to sharply curtail the sale of military equipment to Israel, accusing the Israeli military of violating humanitarian standards imposed by U.S. law. On Tuesday, a group of 20 Democratic members of Congress, including two members of the far-left 'Squad' submitted a joint letter to the Biden administration calling on the White House to impose an arms embargo on Israel, barring the transfer of all offensive military equipment. The letter, penned by Reps. Greg Casar (D-TX) and Summer Lee (D-PA), accuses Israel's military of violating the Leahy Law, a pair of 1997 measures spearheaded by Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy which prohibit the transfer of arms to foreign military units under 'credible' suspicion of committing 'gross human rights' violations. In October, the Biden administration warned the Israeli government in a letter that it was giving the IDF one month to alter its policies in the Gaza Strip, or face the potential loss of access to American arms under the Leahy Law. In their letter Tuesday, the 20 Democratic lawmakers argued that despite the administration's statement in November that Israel was found to be in compliance with the law, they believe the IDF has 'failed to meet' the standards imposed by American regulations. 'We believe continuing to transfer offensive weapons to the Israeli government prolongs the suffering of the Palestinian people and risks our own national security by sending a message to the world that the US will apply its laws, policies, and international law selectively,' the letter reads in part. 'Furthermore, a failure to act will put Israeli lives in danger by prolonging Netanyahu’s war, isolating Israel on the international stage, and creating further instability in the region,' the lawmakers continued. 'While Israel made nominal progress in some areas, it overwhelmingly failed to meet the minimum standards laid out in the Administration’s own letter.' 'We urge your Administration to adhere to and uphold U.S. law by suspending offensive military transfers to Netanyahu and his government.' 'Failure to do so not only risks our leverage in ceasefire negotiations, it undermines our country’s own national security and weakens America’s commitment to human rights as a cornerstone of our foreign policy.' 'We remain committed to saving Palestinian and Israeli lives. This means doing everything possible to prioritize the release of hostages, secure a lasting ceasefire deal, and move toward long term peace.'

Watchdog: Iran on brink of nuclear weapon, old deal is pointless	Iran 'has uranium at 60% — 90% is military grade — and is thus practically at the same level as nuclear-armed states,' says head of nuclear watchdog group. By World Israel News Staff The head of a nuclear watchdog group warned on Monday that Iran is on the verge of becoming a nuclear state, meaning that reinstating the 2015 nuclear deal is no longer a relevant starting point for negotiations with Tehran. In recent days, the United Nations' head of political affairs called for a revival of the plan, urging signatories - including the U.S. and the European Union - to 're-engage' with Iran. But Raphael Grossi, chair of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that Iran's nuclear program had progressed significantly in recent years, including enriching uranium up to levels nearing wepaons-grade. Due to the fact that Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities are far greater than they were at the time the original deal was drafted, the 2015 'agreement is no longer useful,' Grossi told Italian news agency ANSA on Monday. Iran 'has uranium at 60% — 90% is military grade — and is thus practically at the same level as nuclear-armed states,' he added. 'We must reformulate the agreement,' Grossi said. 'This is a complex process whereby the European countries and the U.S., Russia, and China will have to sit at the table with [the IAEA] to define a system that serves the new Iranian reality.' In October 2024, Israel reportedly destroyed a secret nuclear weapons testing facility south of Tehran. 'The strike was a not so subtle message that the Israelis have significant insight into the Iranian system even when it comes to things that were kept top secret and known to a very small group of people in the Iranian government,' a Biden administration official told Axios. After the strikes, which also targeted Iran's ballistic missile and drone manufacturing factories, along with its air defenses, Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that Iran is 'more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities.' He added that 'we have the opportunity to achieve our most important goal—to thwart and eliminate the existential threat to the State of Israel.'

Report: Hostage deal not imminent, has a ‘long way to go’	Claims that Israel and Hamas are nearing an agreement 'don't help the negotiations,' says Israeli official. By World Israel News Staff Israeli officials with firsthand knowledge of the ongoing talks between Israel and the Hamas terror group poured cold water on widely-reported claims that the two sides are nearing a hostage deal. Speaking to Axios, three sources said that there are still major issues of contention between the parties and that 'The gaps are still significant. There are gaps that the negotiations teams can bridge, and that is what they are trying to do now in Qatar. In any case, there is still a long way to go,' an Israeli official with knowledge of the talks told Axios. Another Israeli government insider slammed Hebrew-language media for publishing reports claiming that the parties on the cusp of a deal. 'It doesn't help the negotiations. It misleads the public and creates false illusions,' the source said. A third Israeli official told Axios that 'a deal is not around the corner.' In a statement on Tuesday, Hamas said ongoing negotiations in Qatar 'serious and positive.' The terror group then claimed that 'reaching an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange is possible if the occupation [Israel] stops imposing new conditions.' Hamas official told the Saudi media outlet Asharq al-Awsaton Monday that the sides were 'closer than ever' to securing a deal. the Lebanese outlet Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported on Monday that both Israel and Hamas had demonstrated 'unprecedented readiness' to reach a deal. According to Arabic media reports, Hamas is demanding the release of imprisoned arch-terrorist Marwan Barghouti as part of a hostage deal. Barghouti, a founder of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades terror group, is an extremely popular figure among Palestinians. Israeli negotiators were said to have outright denied the demand. Barghouti, 65, is currently serving five life sentences for his involvement in deadly terror bombings targeting Israeli civilians during the Second Intifada.

‘Antisemitic liar’ – FM slams Irish president over latest slander	Let us not forget that Ireland was at best neutral during World War II,' says Israel's Foreign Minister. By World Israel News Staff Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar slammed Irish president Mike Higgins for the second time in days, after the Irish leader falsely accused Israel of planning to usurp land from Egypt and establish settlements. The exchange came as tensions between Israel and Ireland continue to worsen, with Sa'ar recently closing the Jewish State's embassy in Dublin due to the country's 'extreme anti-Israel' stance. Sa'ar said that Higgins and others in the Irish government are 'encouraging antisemitism' via the 'delegitimization and dehumanization of Israel.' On Tuesday, Higgins responded by claiming that Sa'ar's comments are intended to serve as a distraction from Israel's alleged violations of international law. 'It is a very serious business to actually brand a people because in fact they disagree with Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu, who is in breach of so many bits of international law, and who has beached the sovereignty of three of his neighbors, in relation to Lebanon, Syria, and would like in fact actually to have a settlement into Egypt,' Higgins said. Sa'ar didn't hold back when responding to the latest accusations from the Irish president. 'Once an antisemitic liar — always an antisemitic liar,' Sa'ar said of Higgins in an English-language statement. 'From Lebanese territory, Israel’s sovereignty was breached for over a year,' the statement continued. 'For no reason and unprovoked, Hezbollah joined Hamas on October 8th [2023] and since then fired tens of thousands of missiles, rockets and drones at Israeli citizens and communities. Israel did what any country would — it defended itself against a brutal aggressor.' Higgins' claim of Israeli designs on Egyptian territory are nonsensical, Sa'ar stressed. He 'invented the claim that Israel seeks to form settlements there. In the context of our peace agreement with Egypt, Israel withdrew from a huge area — all of the Sinai desert, and uprooted all of its communities there. This peace agreement has been maintained since 1979.' Sa'ar concluded by noting that Ireland had not joined the Allies in fighting Nazi Germany. 'Let us not forget that Ireland was at best neutral during World War II,' he said. 'At that time, the free world was fighting Hitler’s axis while Ireland sat on the side and did nothing.'

Saudis want peace with Israel, don’t care about Palestinian state...	Netanyahu believes that the Saudi Crown Prince is not particularly interested in a Palestinian state. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Saudi Arabia may drop its requirement that Israel make an absolute commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian State as a pre-condition for a normalization agreement, according to a report in Haaretz. Instead of requiring Israel to promise to establish a Palestinian state, the wording of the agreement now requests that Israel merely 'create a pathway' to a two-state solution. The talks began after the ceasefire with Lebanon with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conducting the negotiations with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman through Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer. According to the report, Netanyahu believes that the Saudi Crown Prince is not particularly interested in a Palestinian state, but feels he must address the issue to deal with public pressure. Therefore, the open-ended wording that Israel should 'create a path towards statehood' will likely garner political support. In addition, a normalization agreement is likely to facilitate a hostage release deal since Riyadh has expressed interest in the reconstruction of Gaza, a positive for Israel since it would involve a more moderate Arab State. Just a few months ago, the chances of a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia seemed remote. In September, Saudi Arabia suspended negotiations regarding a U.S.-brokered peace deal with Israel due to concerns over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 'extreme right' coalition partners, according to a Saudi outlet. The Elaph newspaper reported that the Gulf kingdom has frozen talks due to worries that Netanyahu's government will not agree to sweeping concessions to the Palestinians, which Saudi Arabia considers a major condition for a normalization agreement. The report blamed Religious Zionist Party head Betzalel Smotrich and Otzma Yehudit chairman Itamar Ben-Gvir for being unwilling to negotiate in good faith regarding 'any gestures' towards the Palestinians. Smotrich stressed in an interview with Army Radio that he would not support a normalization agreement that included 'any concessions to the Palestinians.' He added that although Israel was interested in formalizing ties with the Gulf kingdom, such a deal 'has nothing to do with Judea and Samaria.'

After Hezbollah supply lines cut in Syria, Tehran will ‘reexamine...	The Iranians could try to establish connections with rebel factions by buying them out, thereby attempting to rebuild the weapons corridor. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS Iran’s arms supply lines to Hezbollah via Syria have been severed by the fall of President Bashar al-Assad, leading to an unprecedented strategic setback for Tehran and its Lebanese terror proxy, according to observers in Israel. Tal Beeri, head of Research at the Alma Center, which specializes in Israel’s security challenges in the northern arenas, told JNS on Monday that 'we’re talking about a very, very significant blow' to Hezbollah’s Iranian supply chain. The first reason for this initial near-term assessment, he said, is that the Syrian territory once controlled by Assad served as Iran’s primary conduit for transporting weapons into Lebanon. 'Practically all the weapons for Hezbollah were funneled through this corridor,' which encompassed land routes, air routes through Syrian airports—possibly including the Russian airbase Khmeimim—and sea routes stretching from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas in Iran to northwest Syria, mainly the port of Banias, from where weapons would be delivered to inland depots. 'That’s how the Iranians moved goods to Lebanon. Meaning, effectively, the entry gate of Iranian weaponry on Syrian soil has been cut off,' said Beeri. 'In the end, control throughout Syria is in the hands of the rebel factions and Kurds, who, by the way, dominate all of eastern Syria, including the land entry routes. So currently, it is not possible to transfer weapons to Hezbollah through Syria.' The second factor, he added, is the large-scale air strikes conducted by the Israel Defense Forces, targeting the entire Syrian military and its weapons depots. This prevented 'a last-minute quick transfer of relevant weapons into Hezbollah’s hands,' according to Beeri. 'For these two reasons, there is basically a nearly complete severing of the weapon oxygen line to Hezbollah,' he said. However, Beeri cautioned that Iran and Hezbollah might yet adapt and adjust to the new situation. 'I estimate they will recalculate and make new efforts … possibly by attempting direct shipments of weapons to Lebanon' by air or sea. Such efforts could see ships and planes travel to Lebanon from Iran via third-party countries to try and deceive Israeli intelligence,' he added. In addition, said Beeri, 'money trumps ideology.' The Iranians could try to establish connections with rebel factions by buying them out, thereby attempting to rebuild the weapons corridor. Professor Boaz Ganor, president of Reichman University and founder of the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, told JNS, 'The biography of Ahmad al-Sharaa [aka Mohammed al-Julani, the leader of the largest rebel umbrella group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham] points to fundamental hostility toward Israel. His senior membership in Al Qaeda, close to [Abu Musab al-]Zarqawi and [Ayman al-]Zawahiri, could indicate the future trends of Syria under his rule.' Ganor warned that 'we must not let the seemingly pragmatic position he presents recently mislead the world or Israel.' Addressing moves by Turkey to exploit the situation, Ganor added, 'Syria will not be able to exist without the aid of another country or countries. Those countries will become the patron of the new regime, and there is no doubt that Iran will try to bridge past hostilities with the rebels and establish ties with al-Julani through generous economic aid, emphasizing an anti-Israel ideological common denominator and concealing the religious tensions between Sunni and Shi’ite.' (The Syrian rebel factions are mostly Sunni Muslims, whereas Iran is Shi’ite.) Ganor noted that Iran could have back-door influence on Al Qaeda through the organization’s leader, Saif al-Adel, who sought and received asylum in Iran after U.S. forces entered Afghanistan. 'If al-Julani returns to his ideological roots in Al Qaeda, Iran’s influence on him could grow stronger,' said Ganor. That might enable the reestablishment of the weapons corridor if Iran and the new Syrian regime found common ground, he added. On Dec. 13, Israel Hayom reported that Hezbollah’s Secretary General Naim Qassem had acknowledged publicly the impact of Assad’s collapse on the terror group, including the loss of military supply routes in Syria. However, he claimed Hezbollah would work around this and look for new ways to smuggle weapons into Lebanon.

Summit of U.S. and Canadian mayors launch joint initiative to out...	During the conference, a new tool was introduced—the Municipal Action Index Against Antisemitism—which ranks and evaluates local authorities based on their commitment and effectiveness in combating antisemitism. By Jewish Breaking News In the United States, mayors of major cities gathered for a summit against antisemitism, with a focus on honoring Israeli mayors and community leaders. Representing Israeli municipal leaders was Yisrael Ganz, Governor of the Binyamin Regional Council and Chairman of the Yesha Council. The event, initiated by the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM), took place in Beverly Hills, California, and brought together around 170 prominent mayors from across the United States and Canada. According to the organizers, 'Antisemitism is an urgent and growing threat, endangering not only Jewish communities but also the core values of our diverse democratic society. Mayors have a unique ability to proactively address antisemitism at the local level, where it is most acutely felt.' During the conference, a new tool was introduced—the Municipal Action Index Against Antisemitism—which ranks and evaluates local authorities based on their commitment and effectiveness in combating antisemitism. At the event’s peak, the mayors paid tribute to Israeli community leaders for their steadfast resilience over the past year. Representing the Israeli leaders, Yisrael Ganz, Governor of the Binyamin Regional Council and Chairman of the Yesha Council, expressed his gratitude: 'On behalf of all Israeli municipal leaders, their residents, and the residents of Judea and Samaria, I thank you for your warm support during these challenging times. In meetings with several of you over the past year, and again today, there is an understanding that was not always reflected in the policies of the outgoing administration: those who allow extremists and antisemites to thrive in their backyard may wake up to their own version of October 7—whether in the U.S. or Europe,' Ganz said. 'In Israel, we learned this lesson the hard way. We allowed Palestinian Arabs and Hamas to grow stronger in the heart of the Land of Israel, and now we’ve woken up to the consequences. Despite our warnings that withdrawals from the Land of Israel and concessions to terror would only amplify it, we were not heeded, and this is the result.' He continued, 'The antisemitic rhetoric and incidents we have witnessed—and still see—against Jews in the U.S. indicate a simmering backyard that, regrettably, gains legitimacy in certain circles, even on campuses.' Ganz called on his fellow municipal leaders: 'I urge you, as the representative of Israeli municipalities, to issue a joint call to outlaw the BDS movement in your cities and states. You are leaders of the United States, and you have the opportunity to guide this great nation toward a more moral and secure future—not only for Jews but for yourselves, as citizens of the free world who cherish liberty.' In his speech, Ganz explained, 'The BDS movement is antisemitic, operating under the guise of political criticism. In a free world, it has no place. What began as a boycott of Judea and Samaria’s products has escalated into a boycott and incitement campaign against the entire State of Israel, Israelis, and Jews everywhere.' The Mayor of Beverly Hills, who hosted the summit, announced that the October 7 Memorial, established in the city to honor those murdered and kidnapped, will become a permanent fixture.

One-quarter of Israelis struggle with food insecurity, report rev...	According to the findings, 86.4% of families had to forgo mental health assistance, and 70.8% refrained from buying necessary medications or seeking medical care. By Pesach Benson, TPS One-quarter of Israelis face food insecurity according to a report released on Monday. 'The Alternative Poverty' report, released by a Latet, a Tel Aviv-based non-profit fighting poverty found that one-third of Israel’s children — more than one million kids — are affected. Food insecurity refers to a situation in which individuals or households lack consistent access to enough nutritious food for an active and healthy life. This is typically due to financial constraints, insufficient food availability, or lack of access to affordable and nutritious options. The report noted that 65% of the households supported by Latet saw their financial situation worsen in the past year, forcing parents to cut back on essential items. Eighty percent of the families said they lacked money to buy sufficient food while half said they had to reduce or stop purchasing baby formula. The financial stress is also impacting health-related decisions. According to the findings, 86.4% of families had to forgo mental health assistance, and 70.8% refrained from buying necessary medications or seeking medical care. The report said 2.76 million Israelis — or 28.7% of the population — live below the poverty line and warned of lower-middle-class families slipping into hardship. According to Latet, The minimum monthly household cost for a family of four rose 6.9% over the past year, reaching 13,617 shekels ($3,549) in 2024 — an additional 10,500 shekels ($2,900) annually.

Iranian American tech executive charged in fatal attack on US tro...	According to court documents, the scheme began in 2015 when Sadeghi established a technology company in Massachusetts after receiving funding from an Iranian government foundation. By Jewish Breaking News Federal authorities have charged two men in connection with a years-long scheme to illegally export sensitive American technology to Iran that led to a deadly drone attack on US forces in Jordan. On January 28, a drone strike hit a US military outpost in Jordan near the Syrian border that killed Staff Sergeant William Jerome Rivers, 46, Sergeant Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Sergeant Breonna Moffett, 23. Forty other American service members were also injured in the devastating attack. While Iran denied responsibility, investigators traced the drone’s navigational system to a company owned by Mohammad Abedininajafabadi, 38, of Tehran, who has deep connections to the Iranian government and military. As the investigation progressed, evidence led them to Mahdi Mohammad Sadeghi, 42, a dual US-Iranian citizen who worked as a product marketing manager at Analog Devices Inc. in Norwood (ADI). According to court documents, the scheme began in 2015 when Sadeghi established a technology company in Massachusetts after receiving funding from an Iranian government foundation. He later connected Abedininajafabadi with his employer through a Swiss front company called Illumove, facilitating at least 14 illegal technology transfers between 2022 and 2024. 'We often cite hypothetical risk when we talk about the dangers of American technologies getting into dangerous hands,' said Acting Massachusetts US Attorney Joshua Levy at a Boston press conference. 'Unfortunately, in this situation we are not speculating.' Sadeghi appeared in US District Court in Boston Monday and was ordered held pending a detention hearing. Abedininajafabadi was arrested in Italy and faces extradition to the United States. The charges include conspiracy to illegally export sensitive technology and, for Abedininajafabadi, providing material support to a terrorist organization resulting in death. A spokesperson for ADI said the company is cooperating with investigators. 'ADI takes its compliance obligations and role in national security very seriously,' a spokesperson said in an email Monday night. 'We have cooperated fully with federal law enforcement and will continue to do so throughout the proceedings. ADI is committed to preventing unauthorized access to and misuse of our products and technology.'

Two soldiers killed in Gaza, bringing IDF toll to 818	The death toll among Israeli troops since the start of the Gaza ground incursion on Oct. 27 stands at 386, and at 818 on all fronts since the Hamas-led massacre on Oct. 7, 2023. By JNS Two Israel Defense Forces soldiers were killed during counter-terror operations in the southern Gaza Strip, the military announced Tuesday morning. The slain soldiers were identified as Maj. (res.) Moshiko Maxim Rozenwald, 35, and Sgt. Maj. (res.) Alexander Anosov, 26, both from the city of Modi’in-Maccabim-Re’ut in central Israel. According to a preliminary probe, the two were killed when a heavily damaged building collapsed in the Rafah area. Last week, three IDF soldiers were killed in combat in northern Gaza. The same day, the military announced the deaths of four soldiers in Southern Lebanon, despite the ceasefire currently in effect there. The death toll among Israeli troops since the start of the Gaza ground incursion on Oct. 27 stands at 386, and at 818 on all fronts since the Hamas-led massacre on Oct. 7, 2023, according to official IDF data. Additionally, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage-rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Israeli troops reported outside of Damascus	Russian report claims that Israeli ground troops were deployed via helicopter to an area outside the Syrian capital of Damascus, possibly in search of remains of executed Israeli spy. By World Israel News Staff Israeli ground forces were spotted operating outside of the Syrian capital city of Damascus on Monday, according to a report Tuesday by the Russian media outlet Sputnik. The report claimed that an IDF helicopter landed near Damasus Monday night, allowing Israeli soldiers to disembark. Sources cited by the report claimed that the IDF troops operated near the helicopter landing site for 20 minutes before moving south. 'Soldiers entered the site and left after about 20 minutes, heading toward southern Syria.' Later Monday night, airstrikes attributed to Israel were reported in the Sitt Zaynab area outside of Damascus. Arab media outlets reported Monday and Tuesday that the IDF has increased its operations in and around the buffer zone along the Syrian frontier. Al-Mayadeen, a Lebanese outlet aligned with Hezbollah, claimed Tuesday that Israeli forces were operating inside the town of Hader in Syria. IDF officers have reportedly met with leaders from local Druze communities, some of which have urged Israel to take control of the area following the collapse of the Assad regime. A report by The Times of Israel claimed that Israeli forces have been operating in Syrian territory in a bid to locate the remains of Eli Cohen, an Israeli spy executed in 1965 after he infiltrated the Syrian military intelligence establishment. Following the removal of President Bashar Assad from power on December 8th, Israel's military has also operated across Syria to dismantle the country's offensive capabilities, including chemical weapons facilities, arms caches, naval and air bases, and missile emplacements. On Monday, Israeli forces decimated Syria's air defense network and struck missile depots in the Tartous region on the Mediterranean coast in what the anti-regime Syrian Observatory for Human Rights called the 'heaviest strikes' on the area in over a decade.

Settler leaders call on Israel to use ‘Gaza model’ to purge Judea...	This front against Israel is a danger that must be recognized and forceful action must be taken, they wrote to the security cabinet. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Judea and Samaria leaders demanded Sunday that the IDF use the ‘Gaza model’ to empty their region of terrorists in light of the danger that this front could easily erupt at any time and cause loss of life that was preventable. In a letter to the security cabinet, the heads of the settlement umbrella group the Yesha Council and local regional councils said that terror hotspots in the Palestinian Authority should be cleared out en masse of their residents, much as the Israeli army has done in northern Gaza. 'The population living in zones identified with terrorism, with a focus on ‘refugee’ camps and known terror complexes, should be moved,' they wrote. 'After moving the population, the terrorism infrastructure should be dismantled exactly as we have done in the Gaza Strip, meaning: any incriminated building to be destroyed, every terrorist to be taken out.' Only such actions would enable Israel to deal with the various Palestinian terrorist groups in a way that will 'exert effective pressure and extract a significant price.' The threat to their population was real, they said, because Iranian efforts to roil the territory was bearing fruit and deadly terror attacks and attempted attacks were on the rise. Just last month, the Shabak (Shin Bet internal security agency) and the IDF seized a large shipment of Iranian weapons that had been smuggled into the region, which included rockets, remote-control bombs, mortar and RPG launchers, firearms and ammunition. Yesha Council Chairman Yisrael Gantz pointed out that there was no way of knowing how many shipments the security authorities had missed, and that the danger was not limited to Judea and Samaria. 'Even a single missile that may have been successfully smuggled into the country, which we are unaware of and is hidden in someone's home, is enough to put every plane landing at Ben Gurion Airport at risk,' he noted. The leaders also asked in their letter that Palestinian movement should be restricted on the region’s roads, which had been the focus of thousands of shooting, ramming and rock throwing attacks a year even before October 7. The letter said that the precarious security situation in the region was 'the result of policies initiated under the Oslo Accords,' and said that 'is within your power to change this, and it is your duty to do so.'

Israeli man arrested for plotting terror attacks on behalf of Ira...	Authorities say the Jerusalem man had spied on behalf of Iran and was plotting terrorist attacks orchestrated by Iranian intelligence operatives. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli man working on behalf of Iranian intelligence spied on targets in Israel, and plotted terrorist attacks on behalf of the Islamic republic, Israeli authorities announced Tuesday. In a coordinated operation in November 2024, Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency and the Central Unit of the Jerusalem Police arrested a 23-year-old Jerusalem resident, Erdler (Israel) Amoyal, on suspicion of conducting espionage and planning attacks under the guidance of Iranian intelligence operatives. Amoyal is alleged to have received financial compensation for his activities. According to the joint investigation, Amoyal began communicating with Iranian intelligence agents in October via social media. Initially contacted by a profile named 'Ariana,' Amoyal’s correspondence was later transferred to an operative identified as 'John,' who managed his activities. Despite understanding early in their interactions that 'John' was an Iranian operative, Amoyal agreed to carry out intelligence-gathering and other assignments, including photographing sites, spraying graffiti, and sending detailed reports back to his handler. Tasks completed by Amoyal reportedly included photographing locations in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Netanya, as well as spraying graffiti bearing the name 'Sinwar' in Tel Aviv. He documented his missions using a GoPro camera and produced a video depicting a vehicle fire. Investigators also found evidence that Amoyal had searched online for firearms, silencers, and explosive-making materials, and watched tutorials on constructing explosive devices. Furthermore, Amoyal attempted to recruit additional individuals, including those with criminal backgrounds, to assist in future operations. He proposed plans to sabotage Jerusalem's light rail system by targeting its power supply and even suggested burning a police car. Video footage of potential targets near the light rail was shared with his Iranian handler. In exchange for his activities, Amoyal received payments in cryptocurrency from his Iranian contacts. The Shin Bet and police emphasized that this case highlights ongoing efforts by Iranian intelligence to recruit Israeli citizens for espionage and terrorism. 'This investigation once again exposes the relentless efforts of Iranian intelligence to enlist Israeli citizens to further their agenda of espionage and terror within Israel,' a Shin Bet spokesperson said Tuesday. 'This is done with the full knowledge of the operatives about their handlers' identities, motivated by financial gain.' Israeli authorities have filed a prosecutor’s statement against Amoyal, with a formal indictment expected in the coming days. His detention has been extended until December 20, 2024. The Israeli police reiterated their commitment to countering threats against national security, stating: 'Espionage for a hostile state during wartime, or otherwise, is a grave and dangerous act that constitutes betrayal of the country. Israeli security forces will spare no effort in bringing those involved to justice.'

Hamas calls to escalate civil war in Palestinian Authority as US ...	Gaza-based terror group looks to enlist support of other organizations as internecine battle between Palestinian factions continues in Jenin, while the US urges Israel to allow upgrading of Palestinian Authority’s paramilitary force. By World Israel News Staff The Gaza-based terror organization Hamas is attempting to escalate an ongoing internecine conflict within the Fatah-ruled Palestinian Authority, calling on additional terror groups to join a battle for control of the city of Jenin in Samaria. In a statement issued Tuesday morning, Hamas urged 'all movements, factions, tribal gatherings, and human rights organizations to mobilize massively' and unite behind a terrorist alliance in Jenin currently battling the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority. Hamas framed the ongoing conflict between Jenin terrorists and the Palestinian Authority as part of the broader conflict against Israel, accusing the PA of serving Israeli interests. 'We emphasize that the continuation of the PA's security operation indicates that it is turning a deaf ear to all Palestinian voices calling for its cessation and for the protection of the resistance,' Hamas claimed, saying the PA crackdown 'serves only the occupation army and its futile dreams of ending the resistance in the West Bank.' Beginning earlier this month, the Palestinian Authority’s paramilitary force, the Palestinian National Security Forces, has engaged in a running battle against Hamas forces in Jenin, as well as the so-called Jenin Brigades – a new terrorist faction centered in northern Samaria established by a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement. Both Hamas and the Jenin Brigades joined in clashes with PA forces during an uprising in late July which was ultimately put down by the PNSF. Starting on December 5th, PA forces entered Jenin, challenging the Jenin Brigades for control of the city after Jenin terrorists stole PNSF security vehicles. The rogue group, which has consolidated support within the city from terrorists affiliated with a number of other terror organizations, usurped control of Jenin from the PA in 2022, becoming the de facto ruling force in the city. The Biden administration is urging Israel to allow the U.S. to upgrade the PNSF’s arsenal, in the hopes of bolster the PA in its conflict with the Jenin Brigades. PNSF forces claimed Monday evening to have moved deeper into Jenin, making headway against the Jenin Brigades, with almost half of the Jenin refugee camp under PA control.

Meet Yaniv Bazini, the Israeli college soccer star who could lead...	Bazini’s 14 goals this season are a team high, and he has scored in six of UVM’s seven postseason games, including a clutch game-tying goal in Vermont’s semifinal win over Denver on Friday. By Jacob Gurvis, JTA Yaniv Bazini has scored 14 goals for the University of Vermont’s Division I soccer team this season, making him one of the top scorers in the entire country. But he’s still thinking about one particular goal from well over a year ago. It was Oct. 14, 2023, and UVM was leading Binghamton University 4-0 late in the game — their second contest since the brutal Hamas attack on Bazini’s native Israel only one week prior. Bazini suited up on Oct. 7, but he was, understandably, distracted. One week later, he scored his first goal since the attack, in which Hamas killed 1,200 and took 250 hostage. After netting UVM’s fifth goal of the 5-0 win, Bazini ran to the sideline, grabbed an Israeli flag, and draped it across his back. 'When everything happened in Israel a year ago, I said, well, I won’t really help if I come back to Israel, but I can be the best ambassador, and to show people the real face [of Israel], not the one that they see in the social media,' Bazini, 25, said in an interview on Monday. 'Everybody has such a great energy and attitude towards what we want, and the same goal,' Bazini said. 'Every game, we take it one at a time, and that’s why we got here.' Bazini’s 14 goals this season are a team high, and he has scored in six of UVM’s seven postseason games, including a clutch game-tying goal in Vermont’s semifinal win over Denver on Friday. What a moment #MCollegeCup x @UVMmsoccer pic.twitter.com/VcUKqVggno &mdash; NCAA Soccer (@NCAASoccer) December 14, 2024 Bazini, a senior, was named to the America East All-Conference First Team in 2023 and 2024, and the All-Tournament Team this season. His 30 points this season are tied for third-most in program history, and he’s one goal away from tying the single-season goal record of 15. Bazini was born in Ness Ziona in central Israel and moved to the United States after his military service to pursue soccer. He played one season at North Carolina State University before transferring to UVM for the 2022 season. Bazini said he was drawn to UVM because of the soccer program and its staff. He’s the only Jewish player on the team and has been pleasantly surprised by the outpouring of support he’s received in Burlington, where he’s been involved with the campus Chabad. 'I did not know that there are so many Jewish people in Burlington,' he said. 'Before I came here, I said, well, I’m going to a kind of small place, so I know that most of the Jews are in the big cities. So I did not expect to have [this community], but such a great community.' It hasn’t been an easy few years to be Israeli in Burlington, or at the University of Vermont. The City Council came close to becoming the first in the United States to boycott Israel, pulling a resolution in 2021 amid allegations of antisemitism. This year, the council narrowly vetoed a citizen-led initiative to declare Burlington an 'apartheid-free community,' a protest against the current war. Before the current war, the university drew criticism for permitting an allegedly antisemitic climate, in part over its handling of anti-Israel protest; it agreed in April 2023 to do more to protect Jewish students from antisemitism. 'It’s hard to see that people are ignorant and just antisemitic, or just going with something that is not right, just to be part of something,' Bazini said. 'So it is sad and frustrating, but I think throughout the year and a half that it’s going on, I grew up and understood that it’s a waste of time to talk with them or to deal with that.' He continued: 'You kind of understand that there are those people in the world, and you will never understand it, and you just kind of need to try to do the best to show the face of the reality of Israel or the Jews, or whoever it is, because it is a good face.' Bazini echoed a sentiment that many Israelis have expressed about Oct. 7: that it feels like it never ended. 'It makes you take everything in perspective,' he said. 'And it took me a while to play like myself, and it’s hard until today. You still read the news every day, and you’re still in it, so it’s the same day since Oct. 7.' Bazini represented the U.S. team at the 2023 Pan American Maccabi Games in Argentina. Preston Goldfarb, who coached the team, has high praise for Bazini. 'I have had some outstanding strikers and players over my 52-year career in soccer, but Yaniv is without question one of the purest strikers and most complete players I have been honored and privileged to coach and to remain close with,' Goldfarb said through a Maccabi USA press release. And no matter how Monday’s title game plays out, Bazini is hoping to give Israelis something to be proud about this week. The MLS, America’s professional soccer league, holds its player draft on Friday, and Bazini is hoping to hear his name called. If he’s not chosen, Bazini plans to pursue professional soccer elsewhere, possibly in Europe or Israel. If he joins the MLS, Bazini would be at least the third Israeli player currently in the league, joining the Philadelphia Union’s Tai Baribo and Charlotte F.C.’s Liel Abada. Bazini doesn’t take the opportunity to represent Jews and Israelis lightly. 'It means everything,' he said. 'I got so many messages in the past couple days of kids that are impacted, and not only my soccer, but how I show that I’m Jewish and not afraid of it. By doing ‘Shema Yisrael’ at every beginning of the game or halftime, or every time I score, every time to thank God. 'I impacted a lot of people, and I’m happy that I’ll be in a bigger stage, that I can impact even more people and give them the power not to hide their identity,' he added. 'I had one goal.

IDF order could kick off big expansion of Judea and Samaria citie...	The Jewish population in Judea and Samaria surpassed half a million people, according to a report published almost one year ago. By JNS An order signed by IDF Central Command head Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth on Sunday could kick-start a massive surge in building throughout cities in Judea and Samaria. The military order—which extends the application of legislation related to urban renewal that was previously only in effect within the Jewish state’s pre-1967 lines to Judea and Samaria—could allow for the building of tens of thousands of housing units in the region’s larger cities such as Modi’in Illit, Beitar Illit, Ma’ale Adumim and Ariel. Municipalities in Judea and Samaria can now approve urban renewal projects through shortened planning procedures that do not require political approval. Under the framework, construction projects in Judea and Samaria will reportedly also benefit from significant tax benefits under existing laws. The move was a joint project of the Construction and Housing Ministry, the Defense Ministry and its Civil Administration, the Authority for Urban Renewal, the Israel Tax Authority and other Israeli agencies. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also serves as a minister in the Defense Ministry responsible for civilian issues in Judea and Samaria, told Israel Hayom that normalizing the area is a 'critical national task.' 'The most important part of this order is that it creates normalization: One law for Efrat and Ra’anana,' he said. According to Smotrich, the order 'will allow for the continuation of urban development in Judea and Samaria, just as it is happening in the rest of the State of Israel.' Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf said in a statement, 'The approval of the order allows companies and entrepreneurs to promote urban renewal and construction projects in Israeli local authorities in Judea and Samaria. 'Judea and Samaria, the birthplace of the Bible, are an inseparable part of the State of Israel,' Goldknopf said, adding that the change will 'contribute to strengthening security in all parts of the country and increase the supply of apartments, which will help solve the housing shortage.' The Jewish population in Judea and Samaria surpassed half a million people, according to a report published almost one year ago. There were 502,991 Jews living in Judea and Samaria as of Jan. 1, according to the report, which cited data from the Interior Ministry. The 500,000-plus Jews living beyond the 1967 Green Line account for some 12% of all Jews in the Jewish state. The natural growth of the Jewish population in Judea and Samaria is expected to result in a population in excess of 600,000 by 2030, 700,000 by 2035 and one million by 2047, the report added.

But Verify-Sy, a Syrian fact-checking group, identified the man as Salama Mohammad Salama, a first lieutenant in the Syrian Air Force Intelligence, an agency that served the Assad regime. Residents of Homs identified him as an agent frequently stationed at a checkpoint in the area, according to Verify-Sy. Salama 'participated in military operations on several fronts in Homs in 2014, killed civilians, and was responsible for detaining and torturing numerous young men in the city without cause or on fabricated charges,' according to Verify-Sy. 'Many were targeted simply for refusing to pay bribes, rejecting cooperation, or even for arbitrary reasons like their appearance.' A CNN spokesperson acknowledged that the prisoner 'may have given a false identity' and said the network is investigating his background. 'The events transpired as they appear in our film. … We reported the scene as it unfolded, including what the prisoner told us, with clear attribution,' the spokesperson told the Daily Beast. 'We have subsequently been investigating his background and are aware that he may have given a false identity. We are continuing our reporting into this and the wider story.'

Israel rolls out first domestically made quantum computer	Quantum computers are particularly powerful for tasks like cryptography, optimization, material science, and simulations of complex systems. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel rolled out its first domestically made operational quantum computer, laying the groundwork for further technological advancements. 'This power will have a dramatic impact on science and the global hi-tech industry. Israel, as a world innovation leader, must remain on the cutting edge of these developments. The unveiling of Israel’s first quantum computer is an important milestone,' said Eli Bin, CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, which worked in collaboration with the Israel Aerospace Industries, Hebrew University, and Yissum, the university’s technology transfer company. Quantum computing is a cutting-edge field of technology that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. Unlike traditional computers, which process information in binary bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use 'quantum bits,' also known as 'qubits' which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing quantum computers to process a vast number of possibilities at once. Quantum computers are particularly powerful for tasks like cryptography, optimization, material science, and simulations of complex systems, but they are still in the experimental stage. Quantum computing also promises to revolutionize computing speed and capacity. 'Quantum technologies are set to fundamentally elevate human capabilities across a wide range of fields,' said Boaz Levy, CEO of Israeli Aerospace Industries. The IAI has made substantial investments in quantum technology, including the establishment of Quantum QHIPU’s laboratory, which focuses on designing, simulating, integrating, and adapting practical applications for the superconducting quantum computer. These efforts involve collaborations with global companies and research institutes. Israel first announced plans to build its own quantum computer in 2022 to establish quantum independence. The U.S. and China are regarded as the leading countries in quantum technology, but other countries, including Canada, Germany, Japan and India are also making advances.

CENTCOM targets Houthi base in Sana’a as IDF preps possible strik...	The IDF is preparing for the potential need to conduct another operation in Yemen, following the air force’s bombing of the Houthi-controlled port in Hodeidah on July 20. By JNS American forces carried out an airstrike against a Houthi command and control in Yemen on Monday, according to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). 'The targeted facility was a hub for coordinating Houthi operations, such as attacks against U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the Southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,' said CENTCOM. The strike, which took place in territory controlled by the Iranian terror proxy in Sana’a, 'reflects CENTCOM’s ongoing commitment to protect U.S. and coalition personnel, regional partners, and international shipping,' the statement concluded. CENTCOM Conducts Precision Airstrike Against Iran-Backed Houthi Facility in Yemen On Dec. 16 Yemen time, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted a precision airstrike against a key command and control facility operated by Iran-backed Houthis within Houthi-controlled… pic.twitter.com/DlZ9SQcAqX &mdash; U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) December 16, 2024 Meanwhile, Channel 12 reported on Monday that Israel’s military was weighing a strike on the Houthis following the downing of a ballistic missile earlier in the day that triggered air-raid sirens in the greater Tel Aviv area. 'Following alerts that were activated a short time ago in central Israel, one missile that was launched from Yemeni territory was intercepted and shot down before it crossed into Israeli territory,' the Israel Defense Forces said. The IDF is preparing for the potential need to conduct another operation in Yemen, following the air force’s bombing of the Houthi-controlled port in Hodeidah on July 20, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. The military has operational plans in place and the necessary capabilities to carry them out, should the political leadership decide to proceed, according to the report. Earlier on Monday, an Israeli Navy ship intercepted a Houthi drone over the Red Sea before it crossed into Israeli territory, according to the military. Hezam Alasad, a senior member of the Houthis’ political bureau, said in a Hebrew-language X post on Monday night that, 'The Israeli enemy will pay a price for its continued brutal aggression and siege on our people in Gaza [and] its attacks and invasions in Syria.' On Thursday, the IDF intercepted a Houthi drone headed for the city of Eilat. That UAV likewise did not cross into Israeli airspace. On Dec. 9, a Houthi drone hit a residential high-rise building in the central Israeli city of Yavne, northeast of Ashdod. On Dec. 1, a ballistic missile launched from Yemen triggered sirens in the Judean foothills. The missile was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, the IDF said. Four people were injured running to shelters, according to Magen David Adom. In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv. In response, Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port. On Sept. 29, the Israeli Air Force carried out dozens of strikes in the area of Hodeidah. The targets included 'power plants and a seaport, which were used by the Houthis to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil,' the IDF said.

Israel to retain control over Gaza after war, says Defense Minist...	Pushing back on report claiming he told US Israel had no interest in controlling post-war Gaza, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz says IDF will remain in charge of security in the coastal enclave even after Hamas is defeated. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli forces will remain in the Gaza Strip after the current war with the Hamas terror organization, Israel's defense chief announced Tuesday, emphasizing that the IDF will be responsible for the long-term security control of the coastal enclave. Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) took to X/Twitter Tuesday morning to respond to reports in the Hebrew media earlier in the day claiming he had vowed to U.S. officials that Israel had no interest in controlling post-war Gaza, and downplayed calls within the Israeli government to resettle the Gaza Strip. 'Israel does not want either military control or civilian governance over the residents. There are no decisions regarding settlement in Gaza,' Israel's Channel 12 quoted Katz as telling American officials, adding that the Netanyahu government was working to strengthen the Palestinian Authority from Iranian influence and Hamas encroachment. In his tweet Tuesday morning, however, Katz said Israel would maintain long-term 'security control' over Gaza and would retain the right of 'full freedom of action' militarily. 'In response to various publications - my position on Gaza is clear,' Katz wrote. 'After we defeat Hamas' military and governmental power in Gaza, Israel will have security control over Gaza with full freedom of action, just as it does in Judea and Samaria.' 'We will not allow any terrorist organization against Israeli communities and Israeli citizens from Gaza. We will not allow a return to the reality of before October 7th.' In his tweet Tuesday, Katz did not mention the push within the Netanyahu government to resettle the Gaza Strip, 19 years after the Sharon government evacuated all Jewish towns in the area. On Monday, an MK from the ruling Likud party submitted a bill to the Knesset which would lift the ban on Israelis entering the Gaza Strip. In its explanatory notes, the bill says the move marks the first step in Israel's resettlement and annexation of the Gaza Strip. 'The war against the Islamists in Gaza must end with their complete loss of control over the territory. Therefore, one of the first actions the Knesset should take is to remove the disgraceful provision of a ‘no-go zone for Jews’ from Israeli law.'

‘I won’t stop until every hostage is returned,’ Biden vows at WH ...	I am a Zionist,' declares President Joe Biden at his last White House Hanukkah party, as he pledges to continue working to secure the release of the remaining Israeli captives. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden hosted the final White House Hanukkah party of his presidency Monday night, alongside Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff. During his address to the hundreds of attendees, Biden called himself a Zionist, echoing similar comments he has made in the past. 'And I am a Zionist,' the president said. Turning to the ongoing hostage situation in the Gaza Strip, where roughly 100 Israeli captives have been held by terrorists for over 14 months since the October 7th invasion, Biden took credit for the release of 105 captives in the November 2023 hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, and pledged to continue to push for the release of the remaining captives as long as he remains in office. 'I’ve gotten over 100 hostages out. I will not stop until I get every single one of them home.' 'I've said many times before, my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people and security of Israel and its right to exist as an independent nation state remains ironclad.' A total of 100 Israelis remain held in the Gaza Strip, of whom 96 were taken captive on October 7th, 2023, while four others were already held by Hamas prior to 2023, including the remains of two fallen IDF soldiers seized by Gaza terrorists in 2014. Emhoff, who was tapped by the administration to oversee efforts to curb antisemitism in the United States, said he was 'rededicating' himself to the role during the last month of the Biden White House. 'Tonight, I am rededicating myself to fighting antisemitism and hatred of all kinds,' Emhoff said. 'Even as we saw antisemitism continue to grow and rise in our country and around the world, I walked around with my head held high, my shoulders and chest back, so proud to be a Jew.' 'And everywhere I went, I encouraged our community to do the same, not to cower and not to live in fear ever. And in spite of this scourge of antisemitism, we came together.'

IDF downs Houthi missile fired at central Israel from Yemen	IDF: 'One missile that was launched from Yemeni territory was intercepted and shot down before it crossed into Israeli territory.' By JNS Air-raid sirens pealed in the greater Tel Aviv area on Monday afternoon after Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists fired a missile at the Jewish state from Yemen, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed. 'Following alerts that were activated a short time ago in central Israel, one missile that was launched from Yemeni territory was intercepted and shot down before it crossed into Israeli territory,' the IDF said. Air-raid sirens were activated to warn civilians for the possibility of falling missile fragments following the interception, the army said. The Magen David Adom emergency response group said it treated five people who were lightly injured while running for cover amid the attack. The injured were evacuated to a hospital for treatment, MDA added. Earlier on Monday, an Israeli Navy ship intercepted a drone over the Red Sea that was launched by the Houthis. The UAV was downed before crossing into Israeli territory, according to the military. Hezam Alasad, a senior member of the terror militia’s political bureau, vowed in a Hebrew-language X post on Monday night, 'The Israeli enemy will pay a price for its continued brutal aggression and siege on our people in Gaza [and] its attacks and invasions in Syria.'

On Dec. 1, a ballistic missile launched from Yemen triggered sirens in the Judean foothills. The missile was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, the IDF said. Four people were injured running to shelters, according to Magen David Adom. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched multiple missiles and drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the Gaza-based terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of the northwestern Negev. In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv. In response, Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port.

In 2005, 9000 Israelis were evacuated from 25 settlements in Gaza, and since then, many Israelis have advocated for a renewing a Jewish presence in the region. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Likud MK Avichai Boaron proposed a bill that would permit free movement of Israelis and settlement in Gaza, Ynet reports. On Thursday, coalition MKs are touring the Gaza border with a plan to resettle the area once the war is over. The bill declares that 'In the summer of 2005, the Israeli government decided to expel all Jewish residents from Gaza and the northern West Bank, and to withdraw the military from these areas.' 'As part of this decision, the Knesset passed a law to implement the Gaza disengagement, which included, among other provisions, a ban on Israeli entry into these regions.' 'The ban on entry recalls dark periods in the history of the Jewish people.' The bill states October 7th demonstrates that 'yielding to antisemitism can lead to dangerous consequences.' 'The war against the Islamists in Gaza must end with their complete loss of control over the territory. Therefore, one of the first actions the Knesset should take is to remove the disgraceful provision of a 'no-go zone for Jews' from Israeli law.' 'Full freedom of movement and presence should be granted in Gaza,' Boaron concluded. Coalition MKs Limor Son Har-Melech and Zvi Sukkot will lead the tour of the Gaza border on Thursday to encourage the idea of renewing settlements. Both Har-Melech and Sukkot are head of the lobby advocating for renewing Gaza settlements. Daniela Weiss, the founder of the settler-activism movement Nachala, will join them. In November, Housing and Construction Minister Yitzchak Goldknopf said that he inspected the sites of proposed future Israeli settlements in Gaza. In 2005, 9000 Israelis were evacuated from 25 settlements in Gaza, and since then, many Israelis have advocated for a renewing a Jewish presence in the region. In his tweet, Goldknopf wrote, 'Today, I toured the Gaza Strip settlements. Jewish settlement here is the response to the horrific massacre and a response to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which, instead of focusing on the 101 hostages, chose to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense.'

Israel, Jordan hold secret talks over Assad’s chemical weapons st...	Intelligence officials also raised concerns about Iran exploiting Syria’s instability to smuggle weapons to terrorist factions in Judea and Samaria. By Jewish Breaking News Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad became infamous in 2013 after he attacked his own people with chemical weapons in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, killing hundreds of civilians and children. Using chlorine gas and sarin nerve agents, Assad carried out similar attacks again in 2017 and 2018 in the Idlib province, killing hundreds more. Assad’s escape from Syria last week following rebel advances has raised urgent concerns about his abandoned chemical weapons stockpiles potentially falling into terrorist hands. Secret high-level talks between Israel and Jordan have emerged in response to this terrifying threat, according to three Israeli intelligence officials cited by Axios. Jordan has positioned itself as a key mediator between Israel and Syria’s Hay’at Tahrir ash-Sham (HTS), the Sunni Islamist opposition group that led the revolution against Assad. Israel’s Shin Bet security agency and senior IDF officers secretly met Friday with Ahmad Husni, the director of Jordanian general intelligence, and top Jordanian military commanders to help secure Assad’s chemical weapons stockpiles and open a dialogue of communication with HTS. Intelligence officials also raised concerns about Iran exploiting Syria’s instability to smuggle weapons to terrorist factions in Judea and Samaria. Meanwhile, Israel has taken matters into its own hands by conducting strikes on chemical weapon warehouses and seizing territory in the Golan Heights, including the Syrian military outpost on Mount Hermon. On Sunday, the IDF announced it has conducted nearly 500 airstrikes on Syrian military targets and destroyed most of Assad’s air force, navy, and air defense systems. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan that the IDF will 'temporarily' maintain control of the border area in Syria, while senior Israeli officials indicated that the IDF will retain its presence in Syria’s buffer zone for 'several months and maybe longer.' In response, Syria’s ambassador to the United Nations, Koussay Aldahhak, sent a letter to the Security Council protesting Israel’s actions. 'At a time when the Syrian Arab Republic is witnessing a new phase in its history in which its people aspire to a state of freedom, equality, social justice, the rule of law, peace and stability, the Israeli occupation army has escalated its ongoing aggression on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic,' Aldahhak said. 'Syria renews its call on the United Nations and the Security Council to assume their responsibilities and take firm measures to compel Israel to immediately cease its ongoing attacks on Syrian territory, ensure that they are not repeated, and withdraw immediately according to the areas agreed upon in the Disengagement Agreement.' HTS leader Ahmad al-Shara also condemned Israel’s military actions, calling them 'an unjustified escalation' and urged the international community to help 'respect Syrian sovereignty.'

Global terrorists ‘resilient, determined,’ per US State Departmen...	The United States and its allies adopted a 'tactic more rooted in diplomacy, partner capacity building and prevention' rather than a 'military-centric, U.S.-led approach,' according to the report. By JNS Although the United States and its global partners have had 'key counterterrorism successes,' world terror groups 'remained resilient and determined,' according to the new U.S. State Department report on terrorism in 2023. 'In 2023, Iran remained the leading state sponsor of terrorism, facilitating a wide range of terrorist and other illicit activities in the United States and globally,' the department states in its report, which it is required to file with the U.S. Congress annually. Global terror is 'fast-moving, complex and ideologically diverse,' the report states, noting the Hamas-led terror attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, 'which killed 32 U.S. citizens—with five others still held hostage as this report is being drafted—were a stark and horrific reminder that terrorist groups overseas remain a persistent and pervasive threat to the United States and U.S. citizens and facilities abroad.' 'The ensuing crisis in Gaza has exacerbated widespread instability across the Middle East and globally, with terrorists and violent extremists across the ideological spectrum exploiting the conflict to threaten attacks against U.S. interests worldwide,' it adds. The United States and its allies adopted a 'tactic more rooted in diplomacy, partner capacity building and prevention' rather than a 'military-centric, U.S.-led approach,' according to the report. 'This balance recognizes the full range of counterterrorism tools and ensures a more sustainable whole-of-government and whole-of-society counterterrorism approach with allies and partners around the world,' it states. The report notes that beyond the terror attacks on Israel, Hezbollah’s rocket fire forced the Israeli government to evacuate 'some 80,000 civilians from its northern border for their own safety.' 'Separate from the war in Gaza, Israeli authorities reported 289 shooting attacks in 2023, after 305 such incidents reported in 2022,' according to the report. 'Most of the shootings occurred as Israeli troops entered Palestinian cities in the West Bank to arrest suspects allegedly involved in terrorist activities, but many terrorist attacks targeted Israeli civilians.' (The Biden administration, and some others, refer to Judea and Samaria as 'the West Bank.') The State Department report cited data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which 'reported 1,232 incidents of Israeli settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, including 871 attacks against Palestinian property, 52 attacks that caused physical injury and 134 attacks that caused both property damage and injury, the highest level of violent incidents in the West Bank Judea and Samaria ever recorded since the United Nations started reporting settler-related violence in 2005.' The report adds that 'settler attacks on Palestinians increased after Oct. 7' and that the State Department 'made public statements condemning Israeli settler violence, and in some cases referred to it as terrorism, including in August following the murder of a Palestinian by a group of armed settlers.' Additionally, 'the Palestinian Authority and the PLO continued payments to Palestinian security prisoners, some of whom were connected to terrorism, and the families of ‘martyrs’ likewise connected to acts of terrorism,' the report states. The authority’s '2017 cybercrime law prohibited the production or sharing of content that jeopardizes ‘the public order,’ including promoting human trafficking, drugs and terrorism,' per the report. 'However, PA enforcement has been inconsistent. Certain official PA traditional and social media, affiliated with the Fatah political party, featured content praising or condoning acts of terrorism.' Islamic Republic The Iranian government, as it has done in prior years, 'continued supporting terrorist plots or associated activities targeting dissidents and other perceived enemies of the regime,' according to the report. It noted that the U.S. Justice Department unsealed an indictment in 2023 charging three people with connections to Iran of trying to kill an Iranian dissident in New York City. A U.K. court also found a man who had ties to the Islamic Republic guilty of gathering information for terror purposes. 'In recent years, Albania, Belgium and the Netherlands have all either arrested, convicted or expelled Iranian government officials implicated in various terrorist plots in their respective territories,' the report states. 'Denmark similarly recalled its ambassador from Tehran after learning of an Iran-backed plot to kill an Iranian dissident in that country.' 'Iran pursued or supported terrorist attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets in 2023, including a thwarted plot to attack Israeli tourists in Cyprus,' it adds. 'These plots were being implemented by current and former members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.'

New mayor of Florence, Italy, is the first woman and first Jew to...	Today Florence has around 1,000 Jews among a total population of more than 350,000, and a grand synagogue famous for its late 19th-century Moorish Revival architecture. By Rossella Tercatin, JTA In April, when a group of pro-Palestinian activists pressured Florence’s city hall to have the local honorary Israeli consul resign, they also took aim at a politician, Sara Funaro, who was running for mayor. 'We’re sorry that we haven’t heard one word of condemnation of the Israeli government’s behavior from Marco Carrai,' the honorary consul, the activists said. 'Just as striking is the silence of Councilor Funaro, who has actually wished this person well in his work.' Funaro didn’t respond — and doesn’t appear to have publicly addressed the statement at all. Two months later, she won the mayoral election, becoming the first woman and first Jew to lead the city known as the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance. The April petition incident reflects how Funaro, 48, has navigated being a Jewish politician in Italy. She has expressed support for Israel, talked about what led her to embrace Judaism as an adult and, after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, received police protection due to antisemitic attacks. But she also has not placed Judaism or Israel at the center of her career, instead trying to respond to hate against her with a poker face and framing her public persona around her family’s deep roots in the Tuscan city. 'When you put yourself out there in the context of an electoral campaign as mayor, you know that someone will try to exploit certain things against you,' Funaro told Corriere della Sera, a leading Italian newspaper, after facing antisemitic invective last year on social media. 'It happened also in the past. I have always responded with great peace of mind.' Funaro, who declined the Jewish Telegraphic Agency’s request for an interview, comes from a family that has taken leading roles in Florence’s politics as well as its Jewish community. The Jewish community was mentioned in writing as far back as the 14th century, according to its website. Today the city has around 1,000 Jews among a total population of more than 350,000, and a grand synagogue famous for its late 19th-century Moorish Revival architecture. Funaro’s father, an architect by profession, serves as president of the Opera del Tempio Ebraico di Firenze, a not-for-profit organization established to maintain the synagogue. Funaro’s mother, a Catholic, is the daughter of Piero Bargellini, a centrist who served as the mayor of Florence in the 1960s. His term is best known for the catastrophic 1966 flood of the Arno River, which killed dozens and devastated the city and many of its artworks. He later served as an Italian senator. Funaro was born and raised in Florence, where she studied psychology at the local Università di Firenze. When she was 20, she started working with children with disabilities, and shortly afterward, she became an educator in a care home for psychiatric patients. Funaro says she and her brother were raised without any formal religion. But two decades ago, during a stint working with underprivileged children in Brazil, she decided to formally convert to Judaism. Italy’s official Jewish communities, like traditional Jewish movements globally, adhere to the standard that only those born to a Jewish mother are Jewish, but Funaro told the Corriere della Sera, 'In reality I didn’t have a conversion: I embraced Judaism.' 'Both my dad and mom had a very strong religiosity, but they understood it was a very important individual choice,' she recalled in an interview with the paper. 'Growing up, I began studying Torah and Talmud. I held long conversations with the rabbi. At 26, during my experience in Brazil among needy children, I made my decision.' Funaro has remained involved in the city’s Jewish community, attending synagogue on holidays, said Ugo Caffaz, a friend of her father. 'She studied for many years to get converted; she really wanted it,' he said. She first ran for City Council under the leadership of the center-left mayoral candidate, and future Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi. She lost, but won a seat five years later with the center-left Democratic Party, and was reelected in 2019. In the council, Mayor Dario Nardella tapped her to lead efforts concerning welfare, housing,integration and the advancement of women. She’s focused her political career on making Florence more inclusive, supporting the underprivileged, and fostering diversity. She has made a point of attending the city’s Pride parade and helped establish Florence’s first mosque. She has also spoken up against antisemitism, denouncing the use of yellow stars, a symbol of the Holocaust, by anti-vaccine protesters during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, she criticized an event organized by two far-left Florence municipal council members whose posters described Israel as an apartheid state. 'Florence has always been a city of peace and dialogue and does not tolerate divisive messages that incite hatred,' she said at the time. 'Putting up posters in the city stating that Israel is an apartheid state is not acceptable.' In the summer of 2023, she was the subject of an antisemitic attack on social media. An Instagram user called her a 'Zionist to the bone' and a lobbyist for Israel. Later, Funaro received death threats, and according to Corriere della Sera, the Italian authorities assigned her police protection beginning in October 2023, the month of the Hamas attack on Israel. The 2023 Instagram post drew condemnation from Nardella, who called it 'mean and revolting,' and added, 'Sara is a strong and intelligent woman, and I am sure she isn’t intimidated by these insulting attacks.' Like the leader of the Italian Democratic Party, Elly Schlein, who also has a Jewish father, Funaro has said she 'absolutely' supports the two-state solution, which would see a Palestinian state established alongside Israel. 'Anyone who has been to Israel and Palestine realizes that the only possibility of resolving this conflict is a recognition of the peoples, identities and cultures of belonging,' she told Corriere della Sera in July. In the days following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, she said, 'We need to keep living in the day-to-day, as we have always done,' a message she said she heard from local and national Jewish leaders as well. She added, 'I think that’s the right spirit, of course with a view to the concern and the pain from what has happened.' As in the rest of Italy and globally, antisemitism spiked in Florence following the Oct. 7 attack. 'Some Jewish kids were bullied at school, there have been antisemitic insults against people as they were leaving the synagogue, graffiti, and some unpleasant situations in the university,' said Enrico Fink, president of the Jewish Community of Florence. 'At the same time, we have always felt supported by the authorities who increased security at Jewish sites.' Funaro’s Jewish identity, or her position on Israel, was not a focus of this year’s campaign and did not stir controversy, despite the April petition criticizing her. She has continued to shy away from weighing in on the issue while in office, including declining to comment after the Florence City Council’s vote, just days before the first anniversary of Oct. 7, to urge Italy to recognize the state of Palestine. Agnese Pini, the editor-in-chief of Florence’s newspaper La Nazione, said Florentine voters do not see their new mayor in terms of her religion. 'I think that if anything, for the people of Florence, Funaro is the heir of [her grandfather] Bargellini, I do not think that her religion played a role in her election, neither positively nor negatively,' Pini said. 'Like many others, she received attention from internet trolls, but more for being a woman than for being Jewish.' But Fink said that in the post-Oct. 7 world, Funaro’s election is a positive sign for the local Jewish community. 'I know Sara very well, and I believe she is a good person and capable politician,' he said. 'She has always taken pride in her identity and history, the Jewish and the non-Jewish parts, and in Florence, everyone knows it, so there was no reason for further discussing the topic during her campaign.' Funaro campaigned under the slogan 'Florence in the plural – Many ideas, one city.' Her 89-page platform focused on fostering equality, security, sustainability and welfare, including proposals such as a minimum wage for city employees, keeping public daycares and elementary schools open until 6:30 p.m. to help parents, stationing police in a public park with high crime rates and increasing the number of affordable apartments in the city. Pini said she would not be surprised to see Funaro entering the national political arena someday. 'Serving as the mayor of Florence opens up many opportunities,' said Pini. 'All Florence mayors went on doing something at the national or international level. If Funaro decides to pursue this path, she will definitely have a good chance of succeeding.' In the meantime, the mayor told the Corriere della Sera that she is not scared, despite the attacks against her. 'I have always felt safe in my city,' she said.

Saving lives, building bridges: Emergency readiness fosters coexi...	In the Western Galilee district to which his battalion belongs, Hamed trained and supported teams in 20 municipalities over the past year. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Israeli-Arab volunteers are working with the army’s Home Front Command to improve emergency preparedness in the Galilee in a new sign of coexistence with the Israel Defense Forces. 'In moments of crisis, every second counts. By equipping local communities with the tools and knowledge to act immediately, we’re not just saving lives—we’re building confidence and resilience within the communities themselves,' Commander Wasim Hamed of the 974th Rescue Battalion told The Press Service of Israel. The Basic Self-Help Teams are comprised of local volunteers to offer immediate and independent response to crises such as missile attacks or earthquakes, until better-equipped national rescue services arrive. This model has been nurtured nationally through collaboration with the Israeli Home Front Command. 'At the start of the war, the level of preparedness in many municipalities, especially the Arab ones, was average, sometimes even below. But the transformation has been remarkable. Today, under the guidance of the Home Front Command, most municipalities are ready for almost any scenario,' Hamed said. In the Western Galilee district to which his battalion belongs, Hamed trained and supported teams in 20 municipalities over the past year. Fifteen of the communities in Hamad’s district are Arab, two are Druze and some are mixed. Several of the Arab communities are Christian or a mix of Muslims and Christians. And that means adjusting the training to the local populace. 'In Arab communities, we’ve adapted our training to their cultural and linguistic needs,' Hamed, a Druze from Galilee and native Arabic speaker, noted. 'This flexibility has built trust and allowed us to create a true partnership that strengthens local resilience. Their commitment to their communities is extraordinary and I was truly inspired by them.' Mohammed Awad, Security Officer for Tamra, a Central Galilee municipality of 30,000 civilians, shared with TPS-IL his community’s rapid progress in readiness. 'We jumped from zero to a hundred in terms of emergency preparedness,' said Awad. 'Before, there was little awareness or involvement in these efforts. But now, with the support of the Home Front Command, we’ve trained and retained multiple groups of volunteers who are ready for any crisis.' Awad’s team began with 40 volunteers at the end of 2023 and quickly grew to over 85 in the past year, with teams notably including women. 'The diversity in these teams has become their strength,' Awad stressed. 'Women especially have taken leadership roles, showing that this is about community solidarity, not just crisis response.' Tamra has sustained at least three direct Hezbollah rocket strikes over the past few months, resulting in several injuries among civilians, some of them serious. The strikes galvanized locals to volunteer. For Tamra resident Kheer Abo Elhija, volunteering is deeply personal. 'As a nurse for 20 years, I realize that many people lack the awareness and tools to act during emergencies. When the state of emergency started, I felt it was my responsibility to help, so I gathered a group of friends, and together we approached the municipality to see what we could do,' he told TPS-IL. 'And in no time, our training was organized. That’s how our Self-Help team started.' 'At first, it felt strange having the military so involved in our community,' Abo Elhija admitted. 'But over time, their guidance, advice, and support have been invaluable. They’ve helped us improve, plan, and build a better system for maintaining and expanding our volunteer network.' When one severe missile barrage caused heavy damage in the nearby municipality of Shfaram in November, volunteers from Tamra came to assist. To train the volunteers, sites were needed where complex rescue operations could be simulated. A suitable site was found in the nearby town of Kabul. For weeks, volunteer groups from different municipalities trained for long hours, often after sundown and with loud equipment. Despite the inconvenience, residents living near the training site brought coffee for the trainees to make them feel welcome. 'When volunteers come to train, we make sure to welcome them fully,' Zead Bokai, the Kabul municipality’s Security Officer told TPS-IL. 'It’s not just about drills — we’ve created an environment where people feel valued, whether it’s offering a cup of coffee or ensuring the facilities, such as equipment for area lighting, are ready for them.' 'We’re close to sensitive areas, and during the war, we saw damage from missile fragments,' Bokai added. 'Yet, our town used this experience to learn and improve. Preparation and teamwork are how we’ve managed to stay strong.' Nader Taha, head of the Kabul municipality, praised the Home Front Command. 'The mutual respect and understanding that developed were extraordinary,' Taha told TPS-IL. 'We’re all in the same boat, and if we can help others as well, we’re happy to do so. We have an incredible group of volunteers who participated in every event. They were an integral part of our preparations, perhaps even the most important part. Truly, without volunteers, you realize in times like these how impossible it would be to manage.' Hamed expressed a similar thought. 'These teams are no longer just for emergencies. They’re a testament to the resilience and strength of communities when given the tools to succeed. If you had asked me before 2020 how the army would be received in Arab municipalities, I wouldn’t have believed it. But today, these communities embrace us, knowing we’re here to help them prepare for emergencies and protect lives.'

Sword linked to pharaoh of Passover story discovered in Egypt	According to Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, besides the sword, researchers found what were essentially ancient mess halls and kitchens. By Jewish Breaking News Egyptian archaeologists have found what they believe is a sword linked to the Pharaoh who was famously told by Moses to 'Let My People Go' as recounted in the Torah. The 3,200-year-old bronze ceremonial sword bearing the name Ramses II in hieroglyphics was discovered in the remains of an ancient military complex at Tell Al-Abqain. While the exact age of the fortress remains uncertain, it operated during the reign of Ramses II who held Egypt’s second-longest rule (1279-1213 BC). This period, known as the New Kingdom, was marked by economic and political prosperity but also war. Under Ramses II’s leadership, whose name was also found inscribed on limestone at the site, Egypt engaged in multiple conflicts with the Hittites and Libyans. Of course, he is famously referenced in the Torah as the ruler who refused to let his Jewish slaves free until the 10 plagues rained upon his kingdom. According to Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, besides the sword, researchers found what were essentially ancient mess halls and kitchens. The soldiers had dedicated storage areas filled with large grain bins and massive clay pots still containing old fish and animal bones. They even uncovered the remains of cylindrical clay ovens where meals were once prepared. The excavation also yielded a wealth of personal belongings from the soldiers’ daily lives, including military weapons, hunting equipment, personal adornments, and ivory kohl applicators. Necklaces crafted from carnelian and faience beads, along with a partial bronze ring as well as various scarab beetle artifacts referencing Egyptian deities were unearthed at the site as well. Notably, archaeologists found a cow burial site, significant given the ancient Egyptians’ view of cattle as symbols of divine power, strength, and prosperity. This ritual finds a compelling parallel in the biblical Passover story, when the Jews sacrificed sheep – animals the Egyptians revered as gods – to symbolize their freedom.'

Assad makes first public statement since fleeing Syria	Exiled former Syrian President Bashar Assad details his departure from the country after rebels seized control, claiming he 'fought on until the end.' By World Israel News Staff Exiled Syrian President Bashar Assad, who was deposed last Sunday after an alliance of anti-government forces seized control of the capital city, spoke out publicly for the first time since the collapse of his regime. In a statement published via Telegram Monday afternoon, Assad wrote that he had not planned to flee Syria, claiming instead that he remained on as long as he could and left the country only after Moscow implored him to do so. 'My departure from Syria was neither planned nor did it occur during the final hours of the battles, as some have claimed,' Assad wrote. 'On the contrary, I remained in Damascus, carrying out my duties until the early hours of Sunday, December 8, 2024. As terrorist forces infiltrated Damascus, I moved to Latakia in coordination with our Russian allies to oversee combat operations.' 'Upon arrival at the Hmeimim airbase that morning, it became clear that our forces had completely withdrawn from all battle lines and that the last army positions had fallen.' The deposed Syrian leader claimed he finally agreed to Russia's request to leave the country 'following the collapse of the final military positions and the resulting paralysis of all remaining state institutions.' 'At no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge, nor was such a proposal made by any individual or party. The only course of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught,' he said. The 59-year-old former ruler added that he would not negotiate with anti-regime forces, saying he 'refused to barter the salvation of his nation for personal gain or to compromise his people in exchange for numerous offers and enticements.' 'I stood alongside the officers and soldiers of the army on the front lines, just meters from terrorists in the most dangerous and intense battlefields,' he said. Assad boasted that he had 'never abandoned the resistance in Palestine and Lebanon nor betrayed his allies who stood by him,' arguing that he could not 'forsake his own people or betray the army and nation to which he belongs.'

Israeli DM and Hamas say they are ‘closer than ever to hostage de...	Hamas official and Israel's defense minister say negotiations are now closer than ever to a breakthrough on a ceasefire and hostage deal. By World Israel News Staff Talks between Israel and the Hamas terror organization, brokered by Egypt and Qatar, are 'closer than ever' to reaching a breakthrough that could lead to a hostage deal and ceasefire agreement, Israel's defense chief told the Knesset on Monday. Speaking with the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) said that while he could not provide details, the current proposal on the table will secure the support of most Israelis, adding that an agreement now appears to be in the offing. 'There will be a vast majority in support of the deal that is on the table. We've never been closer, but the less we say, the better. Katz hinted that recent reports that Hamas has softened its position regarding a key Israeli demand - continued IDF control over strategic areas in the Gaza Strip including the Egyptian-Gaza border and the Netzarim zone in central Gaza - are correct. 'I placed the hostages' return at the top of the Ministry's priority list. The Philadelphi Corridor and the Netzarim Corridor will not be an obstacle to implementing a deal. There is flexibility from the other side on these issues,' he said. Also on Monday, a Hamas official told the Saudi media outlet Asharq al-Awsat that talks with Israel are 'closer than ever' to reaching a breakthrough, echoing Katz's comments. 'We are closer than ever to reaching a prisoner exchange deal and a ceasefire, provided that Netanyahu does not obstruct the agreement,' the official said. Hamas has now adopted a 'progressive and highly flexible position,' he added, including the acceptance of an extended IDF presence in Gaza, with the Israeli military gradually withdrawing in phases. Earlier on Monday, the pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar outlet in Lebanon reported that both Israel and Hamas had demonstrated 'unprecedented readiness' to reach a deal.

Podcaster Candace Owens named Antisemite of the Year	StopAntisemitism crowns conservative pundit Candace Owens, who compared pushed medieval blood libels and allegations of 'secret Jewish gangs,' as Antisemite of the Year for 2024, beating out pro-Hamas climate activist Greta Thunberg. By World Israel News Staff Conservative podcaster Candace Owens has been named this year's Antisemite of the Year by a watchdog group monitoring anti-Jewish bigotry, after the former Daily Wire personality pushed antisemitic blood libels and a host of conspiracy theories aimed at Jews. On Sunday, StopAntisemitism announced that Owens, 35, had received over 30,000 votes in the annual Antisemite of the Year poll, beating out climate activist Greta Thunberg. 'Owens edged out Hamas apologist Greta Thunberg and terror-supporting Twitch streamer Hasan Piker for the title, inheriting the dishonor from 2022 winner, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib,' StopAntisemitism said. 'Once celebrated for her unapologetic takes that catapulted her into the conservative spotlight, Owens was given platforms by prominent Jewish conservatives like Dennis Prager and Ben Shapiro. But after Hamas’ October 7th massacre, she revealed her shocking antisemitism, leading to her departure from the Shapiro's Daily Wire and condemnation from PragerU.' 'Owens’ remarks were so vile that even evangelical and conservative groups denounced her, including her father-in-law, Sir Michael Farmer. In addition, She’s been banned from countries like New Zealand and Australia, blaming the fallout on a 'Zionist media empire.'' 'From defending Hitler’s actions in Germany and mocking Jewish fears over Kanye West’s antisemitic tweets to claiming Israel forces Muslims into segregated quarters and insinuating Hollywood is run by 'sinister Jewish gangs', Owens has been rightfully crowned 2024’s Antisemite of the Year.' Owens responded to the announcement in a series of tweets, comparing StopAntisemitism to the Black Lives Matter movement. 'Obviously I will prepare an acceptance speech for my show tomorrow. So many people to thank.' 'The ratio under this post is incredible lol. Zionists are completely out of touch. Reminiscent of BLM in 2020 running around calling everything and everyone racist. From excruciatingly annoying, to mildly entertaining to utterly obsolete. We are all fatigued with ‘antisemitism’.' Once a prominent personality in The Daily Wire's lineup, Owens parted ways with the conservative platform in March, following a series of controversial comments regarding Israel, Jews, and Daily Wire cofounder Ben Shapiro. Along with promoting claims of an evil 'Zionist empire' controlling world affairs and Jewish-run Hollywood sex gangs, Owens has also challenged the historical veracity of the Holocaust and even appeared to offer a defense of Adolf Hitler. 'We have been indoctrinated and we actually know nothing about the person other than the fact that we must fear him,' Owens said in July. In the same podcast, Owens cast doubt on the Holocaust, calling it 'an ethnic cleansing [that] almost took place,' while accusing the Allied powers of ethnically cleansing Germans in Eastern Europe. The Allied powers, she claimed, 'ethnically cleansed 12 million Germans&#8230; in the exact same [concentration] camps that we then transferred the Germans into so that we could mass kill them.' Owens also denied the experiments - often deadly - conducted by the SS officer Josef Mengele, calling documentation of the experiments 'bizarre propaganda.' 'The idea that they just cut a human up and then sewed them back together. Why would you do that? Even if you're the most evil person in the world, that's a tremendous waste of time and supplies.'

Hamas pushing for release of top terrorist in hostage deal: Repor...	Hamas said to be demanding Israel free Marwan Barghouti, who is currently serving five life sentences for his involvement in deadly terror attacks. By World Israel News Staff Hamas is demanding the release of imprisoned arch-terrorist Marwan Barghouti as part of a hostage deal that would see the terror group release Israeli captives held in the Gaza Strip for more than a year, according to Arabic media reports. Barghouti, 65, is currently serving five life sentences for his involvement in deadly suicide bombings during the Second Intifada. A founder of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades terror group, Barghouti is an extremely popular figure among Palestinians, with polls finding he would easily win a Palestinian Authority election for president. Releasing Barghouti is a non-starter for Israel, according to the reports, and Israeli negotiators have outright denied the demand. 'Israel has a vision of alternative lists of Palestinian prisoners, including people who were recently arrested, which could delay the drafting of the agreement,' an Egyptian source told Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with Hezbollah. The source added that Israel wants to exile the released prisoners to third countries, rather allowing them to return to PA-conrolled enclaves in Judea and Samaria or the Gaa Strip. This condition 'may be accepted by the mediators as a compromise to end this new obstacle,' the source said. A Hamas official, speaking anonymously, told a Saudi outlet on Monday that Israel and the terror group were 'closer than ever to reaching a ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal.' However, the group specified that the deal could only come to fruition 'if [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu does not obstruct the agreement,' urging the Biden administration to increase its pressure on the Israeli government. The Hamas official claimed that the terror group has demonstrated 'great flexibility,' including approving a 'gradual end to the war and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces according to an agreed-upon timetable, and guarantees from international mediators.'

IDF to secure Judea & Samaria with border system overrun on Octob...	Hamas mostly neutralized those on the Gaza border on Oct. 7; army says the systems are now better protected. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF is planning to install numerous remote firing platforms to safeguard villages in Judea and Samaria from Palestinian attacks, Army Radio reported Sunday. The 'Shoot on Sight' systems, which are already being produced, consist of an observation tower strewn with cameras and intelligence-collection equipment, and a firing system that soldiers can control remotely, thereby minimizing the operators’ contact with the enemy. Female observers of Unit 636, the intelligence collection unit of the Judea and Samaria Division, will be trained to use the systems. In case of need, they will also be able to fire manually at terrorists attempting to infiltrate the Jewish communities, the report said. In the initial stage, the IDF will set up the platforms in places it defines as the most threatened, with dozens planned for either the entrances to villages or commanding positions in the area. The systems have been in use since 2008, but only on the border with Gaza. Critics have questioned their efficacy, as during the Hamas invasion last October 7, the terrorists neutralized most of the platforms in less than a minute by sending 140 drones simultaneously to drop explosives on the cameras and firing systems, rendering them useless. The few that were not hit operated effectively, killing dozens of terrorists, but overall, the IDF’s forward 'eyes and ears' were lost, leading to an inability to form an accurate picture of what was happening and effectively slowing down the army’s response. The IDF has reportedly said that it has learned its lessons from what happened last year, and has both improved the platforms’ defensive capabilities against such aerial threats and upgraded their operating systems. Other Hebrew-language media questioned whether the IDF was again deciding to rely too much on technological means to secure the country’s citizens. In Judea and Samaria specifically, the regional council heads have begged for years for the IDF to be proactive instead of reactive, considering the danger that the Palestinian Authority poses to their communities in its active encouragement of terrorism and the number of men it has under arms. 'The Palestinian police…are an army for all intents and purposes, armed with automatic weapons and undergoing military training' that can easily be turned against Israel instead of Hamas, the leaders wrote in an open letter to the security cabinet Sunday, after the PA sent forces into Jenin to fight its Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas rivals. The 'Shoot on Sight' systems are expected to become operational in the coming months.

Actor offers blistering response to ‘Free Palestine’ congressman	7 days in Judea and Samaria on me' - Actor Michael Rapaport offers to fly Squad members and vocal Israel critics Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush to Ramallah. By World Israel News Staff Actor and comedian Michael Rapaport took aim last week at a pair of outgoing members of Congress and outspoken critics of Israel, suggesting the two visit the Palestinian Authority in person. On Friday, Rapaport took to X in response to statements on the House floor by New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman and Missouri Rep. Cori Bush. Both Bush and Bowman lost their Democratic primary elections this year, after facing criticism over their stances on Israel. 'Free Palestine, free the Bronx, and free all marginalized people,' Bowman said, joined by Bush, during a House address last Thursday, in a video clip posted by Rapaport. 'Since Jamaal Bowman [and] Cori Bush are now unemployed & sooooo interested in and fascinated by Gaza, I’m offering to fly them to ISRAEL & have a SUV drop them off in RAMALLAH,' Rapaport wrote. '7 Days in Judea Samaria on Me. I will add $150 a day per diem. You guys down?' Comedian and podcaster Dave Rubin responded to Rapaport's tweet, writing: 'I will throw in 20K if they wear a sign that says JEW on their shirt while visiting…' Bowman expressed outrage over the tweet, calling Rapaport a 'clown' and a 'culture vulture.' 'Behold culture vulture Michael Rapaport. We let him in and he represents nothing that Hip Hop stands for. A clown of epic porportions [sic].' 'Is this some sort of threat? I’ve been to Ramallah. Hebron as well. Why don’t you take a trip with Encounter or Breaking the Silence Israel so you might learn something. You won’t because you embody fake Twitter gangsta blowhard shit.

In first since 1967, Syrian mayor meets Israeli officers	Residents of six Druze villages in the Golan have expressed a desire to have them annexed by Israel. By JNS Community leaders in the Syrian side of the Golan, including at least one mayor, openly met with IDF officers holding the area, an Israeli newspaper reported on Sunday. That revelation coincided with reports of a desire by some Druze villagers in Syria to have their communities come under Israeli rule. In one meeting, the mayor of an unnamed village in Syria met with three Israelis, two of them army officers visible in a photograph published on the cover of Yediot Achronot. Wearing full gear and toting assault rifles, the officers, one of them a captain, are seen conversing in what looks like a conference room with a man wearing traditional Arab garb. 'Other meetings are also happening, the fear barrier from the Assad regime has been breached and there are new opportunities for cooperation, including economically, that are already being worked out,' an unnamed Israeli officer told the paper. The meetings are the first of their kind in over 50 years. Israel seized controlling positions in nearby Syria last week following the fall of the regime of Bashar Assad. Israel has also carried out many airstrikes in Syria in a bid to destroy weapons it does not want to see fall into the hands of the Islamists who deposed Assad, Syria, Iran or other regional players. The Israeli side of the Golan Heights, which Israel took from Syria in 1967 and de facto annexed in 1981, passing the Golan Heights Law and applying Israel’s government and laws there, has about 20,000 Druze residents in four thriving villages that have coexisted harmoniously with the area’s majority Jewish population and the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit the area annually. Leaders and most members of that community have long defined themselves publicly as Syrian citizens living under occupation and declined to take up Israeli citizenship. This was largely understood as a policy of deniability in case the Golan is returned to Syria under the dictatorship of Assad, an Iranian ally whose late father, Hafez, waged several wars against Israel. Israel has another 150,000 Druze who are citizens elsewhere in the country, mainly in the Galilee. Syria has about 600,000 Druze while Lebanon has some 250,000. In recent years, the number of Golan Druze who took up Israeli citizenship has skyrocketed, along with participation in municipal elections. However, a large majority of Golan Druze have not done either. The outbreak of the civil war in Syria in 2011, which set the scene for Assad’s ouster, convinced many Golan Druze to become Israeli. Six Druze villages Against this backdrop, a Kurdish news site, Kurdistan News24, reported on Friday that residents of six Druze villages in the Golan have expressed a desire to have them annexed by Israel. A leader of the village of Hader, which is currently under Israeli control and is situated about two miles east of the Druze Israeli town of Majdal Shams, reportedly also said this. The issue was discussed at a meeting Friday in Hader, Kurdistan News24 reported in an article that featured a video from that meeting. It shows a man speaking before about 200 people, reportedly in Hader, asking them: 'What’s our fate, my brothers?' with the crowd responding: 'Israel.' He continued, according to a translation of the speech: 'In the name of all the people of Hader, and if anyone objects, please say,' with no objections heard. 'If we have to choose, we will choose the lesser evil, and even if it’s considered evil to ask to be annexed to the [Israeli] Golan. But it’s a much lesser evil than the evil coming our way. … That evil might take our women, might take our daughters. They might take our homes.' The man also said: 'We want to be annexed to the Israeli Golan to preserve our dignity, and this applies to all of the region’s villages, because their fate is no different. We want to join our people in the Golan and live with freedom and honor.' Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz and other officials said the deployment in Syria was temporary. Uri Heitner, a former leader of Golan communities and a resident of Kibbutz Ortal there, welcomed the appeal to annex Druze villages. 'We certainly shouldn’t reject the idea,' he said. Heitner, who led the fight against plans by the Labor Party to return the Golan to Syria in the 1990s, said Israel could work to establish a Druze state or autonomous region from the Hermon in the northern Golan Heights to Jabal al-Druze, situated about 50 miles southeast of the Hermon. 'Another option is to agree to annex the villages, along with a far wider strip of land that would meet the security interests of Israel,' Heitner wrote in his blog on Saturday. He also analyzed the desire to come under Israeli control by some Druze Syrians, whose communities have family ties with the Israeli ones across the border. 'Over the past 58 years, the Druze of the eastern Golan witnessed the freedom and prosperity enjoyed by their brethren in the Golan in the thriving, democratic State of Israel, compared to their life under tyranny and financial stagnation, and then the decline during the civil war,' Heitner wrote. But the main reason for seeking to come under Israeli control, he added, 'is the fear of Syria becoming an ISIS- or Hamas-style Islamic state, where the Druze would be persecuted and oppressed in the best-case scenario, and end up as the Yazidis did in the worst one.'

Report: Israel and Hamas close to deal – but can’t agree on numbe...	Israel and Hamas both reportedly prepared to compromise in order to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal, with the sole major stumbling block being the number of hostages to be released during the truce. By World Israel News Staff Israel and Hamas are closer now than at any point in the past year to reaching a ceasefire and a hostage deal, according to a report Monday, though one major bone of contention has yet to be resolved. According to a report by Lebanon's Al-Akhbar newspaper, a pro-Hezbollah outlet, both sides are eager to reach a deal which would temporarily halt the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of some of the remaining 100 Israeli captives being held in the coastal enclave. Israel estimates that only half of the 100 hostages are still alive. An Israeli official quoted by Ha'aretz Sunday suggested a major breakthrough was near, and that a deal could be signed as early as Christmas Day and implemented by President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20th. However, a report by Israel's Channel 13 News claimed that Hamas and Israel remain divided over how many hostages will be released during the ceasefire. The report said that Hamas is pushing to reduce the number of hostages to be freed, while Israel is insisting on a larger number, with Jerusalem treating the issue as a non-negotiable red line in talks. Ha'aretz reported that the constantly changing condition of the remaining Israeli hostages has also complicated talks, with several captives who were slated for release in a possible deal being murdered or dying in captivity, while others who were not slated for release have suffered from worsening health, which make put them in the category of seriously ill hostages who would be released under the current deal proposal under consideration. The current framework would see the release of several dozen hostages, including women and children along with elderly and seriously ill captives, in addition to several American citizens. In exchange, Israel would released hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists during an extended truce, which could last as long as 60 days.

Israel appeals ICC arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant	The appeals concern alleged procedural flaws in the ICC prosecutor’s office under chief prosecutor Karim Khan. By JNS Israel on Friday appealed the arrest warrants issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant by the International Criminal Court. The warrants, which Israel and the United States, along with other countries, have rejected and dismissed, accuse the Israeli leaders of committing crimes against humanity and war crimes between Oct. 8, 2023, and May 20, 2024, in Gaza. One of the allegations concerns 'starvation.' Oren Marmorstein, a spokesperson for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, confirmed to NBC News that the appeal had been filed. He described the charges as 'baseless accusations' and asserted Israel’s intent to 'defend the justice of its positions' and oppose what it sees as a 'miscarriage of justice.' Netanyahu has compared the warrants to the trial of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew who was falsely accused of treason in France in 1894. The appeals do not deal with the allegations, which Israel says are belied by the massive flow of aid into Gaza that it has facilitated, as well as by its efforts to avoid killing civilians—including at the cost of exposing its own troops to elevated risk. Instead, the appeals concern alleged procedural flaws on the part of the ICC prosecutor’s office under chief prosecutor Karim Khan. One of the appeals, penned in November and submitted on Friday, focuses on the jurisdiction of the tribunal, which operates under the Rome Statute. Israel is not a party to the Statute and not a member of the ICC and therefore cannot be tried by it. The court is basing its jurisdiction on the fact that the Palestinian Authority, registered as The State of Palestine, joined it in 2015. But that entity is not universally recognized. 'The court’s legitimacy depends, in equal measure, both on the effective discharge of its mandate, and on adherence to its jurisdictional limitations,' the Israeli appeal says. The second appeal concerns the issue of notification, and alleges that the ICC failed to properly notify the Israelis it went after that it was preparing to prosecute them, relying on a 2021 notification instead of issuing a new one in connection with the war in Gaza.

Damascus Jew says new regime has not harmed the tiny community	Synagogues are safe, and 'We are not afraid,' Damascus Jew says. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News One of the last remaining Jews in Syria told Israel's Channel 11 Sunday that the new regime that swept into power a week ago has not harmed the country's tiny community. Although the major group in charge, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), is a Sunni Muslim extremist element, the source said, 'We are not afraid.' He acknowledged that on the first day the rebels took Damascus, there was anarchy and both houses and cars were stolen, but nothing happened to the four estimated Jews left in the city, nor to their personal or communal property. 'No one entered the Jewish properties and synagogues,' he said. 'In recent days,' he added, 'I was walking down the street and one of the rebels said hello to me. Everything is routine. It may be better than it was.' He also hastened to say that it hadn’t been bad for the Jews under the previous nationalistic regime, either, saying 'I was satisfied both during the Assad era and now everything is fine.' Heritage sites, including Jewish ones, were preserved under the Assad regime. Considering the tiny number of indigenous Jews, places such as synagogues could mainly be considered a tourist attraction. The man also expressed cautious optimism that there may be a chance for the new government to move towards peace with Israel. This may not be realistic, considering the extremist Muslim orientation of most of the rebel forces, whose leaders have talked in the past of conquering Jerusalem. In the short term at least, Ahmed al-Sharaa, the HTS leader, said on Saturday that 'The situation in Syria, exhausted by years of fighting, does not allow for entering into new conflicts,' and that 'the top priority is construction and stability,' rather than fights 'that will lead to more destruction.' In that context, he noted that Israeli fears that it was threatened by the new Syrian government were unfounded and 'do not justify the recent violations of Syrian sovereignty.' The IDF pre-emptively moved into the abandoned demilitarized zone along the Golan Heights as a precautionary move to ensure the safety of the Israeli communities there. This included the higher Syrian Hermon spur, which has a much more commanding view of the region than the Israeli Hermon. It has also destroyed most of the Syrian air force, its entire navy, and its air defenses, and carried out hundreds of air attacks on missile sites, chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, and other military sites in order to prevent the old regime’s most dangerous and long-range weapons from falling into the rebels’ hands. The IDF encountered no resistance during any of its strikes. The former ISIS fighter, who has tried to moderate his Jihadist group’s image by talking of protecting all Syrian citizens without discrimination, also insisted that Iran had moved its men out of the country as its ally, Assad, was falling almost without a fight. Israel has been striking Iranian military sites in Syria for years in an effort to prevent the Islamic Republic’s entrenchment right on its northern border. HTS antipathy towards the Islamic republic that propped up the Syrian regime for over a decade of civil war would seem to preclude its becoming a new client state of the mullahcracy, but it remains to be seen if it softens its own ideological anti-Israel stance.

IDF downs Houthi drone launched from Yemen	Earlier this month, a Houthi drone hit a residential high-rise building in the central Israeli city of Yavne, northeast of Ashdod. By JNS An Israeli Navy destroyer early on Monday morning intercepted a drone over the Red Sea that was launched by Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists in Yemen. The UAV was downed prior to crossing into Israeli territory, according to the military. On Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces intercepted a Houthi drone headed for the city of Eilat. That UAV likewise did not cross into Israeli airspace. Earlier this month, a Houthi drone hit a residential high-rise building in the central Israeli city of Yavne, northeast of Ashdod. On Dec. 1, a ballistic missile launched from Yemen triggered sirens in the Judean foothills. The missile was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, the IDF said. Four people were injured running to shelters, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency medical service. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched multiple missiles and drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the Gaza-based terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of the northwestern Negev. In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv. In response, Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port. On Sept. 29, the Israeli Air Force carried out dozens of strikes in the area of Hodeidah. Jerusalem said the targets included 'power plants and a seaport, which were used by the Houthis to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil.'

Slain Al Jazeera journalist was Islamic Jihad terror operative	Slain Gazan 'journalists' are often revealed to be members of the Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror groups./eM> By World Israel News Staff The IDF clarified that a Gazan man killed in an airstrike was a member of the Islamic Jihad terror group, after Qatar-controlled Al Jazeera claimed the slain man was a journalist for the network. In a tweet on Sunday, Al Jazeera claimed that Ahmad Al-Louh, 39, was a civilian cameraman who had been 'brutally killed' by Israeli forces. The network went on to accuse Israel of 'systematic killing of journalists in cold blood' and 'evasion of responsibilities under international humanitarian law.' The IDF said in response that Al-Louh was a platoon commander responsible for Islamic Jihad's central Gaza operations. Al-Louh was killed on Sunday during a strike targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives, who were using a civilian office building in Nuseirat for a meeting. 'The compound was used by the terrorists to plan and execute terror acts against IDF troops in the immediate time frame,' the Israeli army said in a statement. The IDF said that the strike was carried out in a way that minimized the risk of civilian casualties, 'including the use of precise munitions, precise aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence.' The military stressed that 'terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip systematically violate international law, exploiting civilian infrastructure and the Gazan population as human shields for terrorist activity. The IDF will continue to operate against terrorist organizations in defense of the citizens of Israel.' On numerous occasions since the outbreak of the October 7th war, Al Jazeera has claimed that its journalists were intentionally targeted by Israeli forces. The so-called journalist have often been revealed to be members of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other Gaza-based terror groups. According to reports, three of the four hostages rescued by the IDF in June were held in the home of Al Jazeera journalist Abdallah Aljamal.

‘Israel can’t trust terror-supporting PA for security’	IDF must mirror its Gaza counter-terror raids in Judea and Samaria, urge local leaders. By World Israel News Staff Local leaders in Judea and Samaria are expressing their concern that Israel is repeating the defense mistakes which led to the October 7th terror onslaught by trusting the Palestinian Authority to act against terror in the region. In recent days, fearing a coup by Hamas, the PA has stepped up its efforts to destroy terror cells in its territory. The Biden administration has urged Israel to support the PA in its counter-terror operation with military aid and other assistance. 'This operation is a make or break moment for the Palestinian Authority,' one Palestinian official told Axios. But in an open letter to Israel's Security Cabinet, the heads of Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria warned that the Palestinian Authority is inherently hostile to Israel, stressing that the body could turn its weapons against Israeli civilians. 'It is illogical to leave the issue of maintaining our security in the hands of the Palestinian Authority,' they wrote. 'With one hand, the PA is supposedly fighting terrorism, and with the other, it is financing terrorism and paying salaries to terrorists. In order to clean up terrorism, [Israel] needs to fight it.' The letter emphasized that 'the Palestinian police&#8230;are an army for all intents and purposes, armed with automatic weapons and undergoing military training.' The politicians said that the IDF operations in PA-controlled areas in Judea and Samaria must mirror counter-terror efforts in the Gaza Strip. PA civilians must be evacuated from populated areas where terror infrastructure, then troops should move in and destroy those terror assets, they wrote. Additionally, the IDF's top brass must place Judea and Samaria's security as a top priority for the military. 'Three weeks before October 7, we warned the authorities about the potential for a [mass attack on civilians] in Judea and Samaria. We said that the threat was not lone wolf terrorists, but [full-scale] war. They laughed a us and called us delusional,' Israel Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, told Hebrew-language outlet Walla. 'In the end, what we warned about happened in Gaza-adjacent communities. We must what we warned about happened in the Gaza Strip. We must clear the area in order to protect the lives of the citizens of the State of Israel. We need to create one hundred percent security. Not ninety percent and not ninety-five percent,' Gantz added. 'We do not have the privilege of making the same mistake again as we did on October 7th.'

Halevi emphasized that the primary reason for the IDF's actions in Syria was the protection of Israeli communities in the Golan Heights. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, during a situational assessment with other officers, sent a message to Syrian rebels that Israel had 'no intention of managing Syria.' The Commanding Officer of the Northern Command, MG Ori Gordin, the Commanding Officer of the 210th Division, BG Yair Palai, and additional commanders from the General Staff Forum were also present at the assessment. He said, 'We are taking action to prevent these terrorist elements from establishing themselves—extremist terrorists will not be allowed to set up camp near the border. We are not involved in what is happening in Syria, and we have no intention of managing Syria.' Halevi emphasized that the primary reason for the IDF's actions in Syria was the protection of Israeli communities in the Golan Heights. 'We are here to defend the border in the Golan Heights, including the northern Golan Heights and Mount Hermon. There was once an enemy state in this area, its army has collapsed, and now there is a threat that terrorist elements could reach this region.' This is an implied response to criticism from Syrian rebel leader al-Julani who said, 'Israel's claims [about attacks in Syria] have weakened and no longer justify its recent violations.' He said the IDF's ground incursions into Syria 'threaten unjustified escalation in the region.' al-Julani criticized 'Israeli aggression' and claimed it violated the 1974 ceasefire agreement. He also called for 'firm and immediate measures' to get Israel out of Syria. Halevy emphasized that Israel's military operations were intended to protect border communities. 'We are firmly intervening in matters that affect the security of Israeli citizens here, in the communities of the Golan Heights behind us. We are doing so professionally, correctly, and with unwavering determination.' Halevy continued, 'In my view, the preparations along the border—from Mount Hermon to the tri-border area of Israel, Syria, and Jordan—are sound and well-executed. These preparations are designed to bring about significant changes.' He concluded, 'All necessary military resources are in place, and there is a strong buildup of forces. We have reserve soldiers, regular troops, full brigades, special units, and support from the General Staff in every direction. It's essential to use all of this wisely.'

The aid is intended to assist the PA in an operation against a terrorist group in Jenin consisting of members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Biden Administration asked Israel to approve military aid to the Palestinian Authority to fight Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas in Judea and Samaria, Axios reports. The aid is intended to assist the PA in an operation against a terrorist group in Jenin consisting of members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). The Palestinian Authority is concerned that the terror group, inspired by the events in Syria and the toppling of the Assad regime, may want to revolt. According to a PA official, US security coordinator Gen. Mike Fenzel met with Palestinian security chiefs and obtained a list of items the PA urgently needed. The requested equipment includes ammunition, helmets, bulletproof vests, radios, night vision gear, explosive disposal suits, and armored vehicles. Israel must approve all military aid going to the PA, and last year, they had given approval but rescinded it after October 7th. On Sunday, Palestinian Authority security forces continued an uncommon crackdown on terror strongholds in Jenin. An Israeli military source told The Press Service of Israel that the raids were 'the most significant Palestinian operation in recent years.' The operation began yesterday morning and triggered a general strike throughout the area, with businesses, schools, and UNRWA offices shutting down in protest. Human rights organizations are calling on the Palestinian Authority to halt the campaign. Named 'Operation Homeland Defense,' Palestinian Authority forces have seized control of four neighborhoods in the Jenin refugee camp, surrounded hospitals, and carried out extensive searches in alleyways. A source within the Palestinian Authority told TPS-IL that the raids were ordered directly by PA President Mahmoud Abbas, who instructed security forces, 'Do not return until you have full control of the camp, whatever the cost&#8230;' During the operation, PA forces killed Yazid Ja'isa, a commander in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group. Ja'isa had previously clashed with the PA, including an incident in which he seized weapons from Palestinian police guarding Joseph's Tomb and threatened to exchange them for the release of Islamic Jihad members held in Jericho.

By World Israel News Staff Although Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani has made conciliatory remarks about not wanting conflict with neighboring countries, including Israel, there is some indication that he is envisioning 'a Greater Syria,' according to Israel HaYom columnist Dr. Yehuda Balanga. Balanga believes that al-Julani may be aiming for a 'Greater Syria' that includes Lebanon, Jordan and Israel. His peaceful talk may just be an attempt to put his Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham group in a positive light as it grabs the spotlight. Some of al-Julani's statements have given hope that the new Syrian government may seek good relations with Israel. Regarding Israel, al-Julani said the current situation 'does not allow for entering new conflicts. The priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not getting dragged into conflicts that could lead to further destruction.' The world may be prepared to see Al-Julani, formerly a member of ISIS and Al-Qaeda with a $10 million US bounty on his head, as a reformed 'man of peace.' However, al-Julani has made other statements taking a less charitable view of Israel. He said that Israel's claims about Syria 'no longer justify its recent violations' and the IDF's ground incursions into Syria 'threaten unjustified escalation in the region.' Al-Julani criticized the Israeli 'aggression' and claimed it violated the 1974 ceasefire agreement. He called for 'firm and immediate measures' to get Israel out of Syria, which implies that Syria would be in conflict with Israel if the IDF does not withdraw from its positions and continues to target Syria's military infrastructure. Does al-Julani's group really think that 'Greater Syria' will one day rule its neighbors including Israel? No one can be sure, but hearing Syrian rebels screaming that their next stop is Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem may be a sign of troubling times to come.

Netanyahu talks hostage deal, Syria turmoil with Trump	Netanyahu was one of the first world leaders to speak with Trump after the latter’s Nov. 5 election victory in the United States. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke overnight Saturday with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, according to Hebrew-language media. The two leaders reportedly discussed a potential hostages-for-ceasefire deal with the Hamas terror group, the fall of the Assad regime to Islamist fighters in Syria and the Iranian nuclear threat. Last week, Trump made it clear that while he hopes for an end to the war in the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem must secure a decisive victory. 'I want [Netanyahu] to end it, but you have to have a victory,' Trump stated. Adam Boehler, Trump’s special envoy for hostage affairs, is visiting Israel this week amid ongoing negotiations to secure the release of the remaining captives in Gaza. He will meet with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on Monday, Ynet reported on Saturday night. His visit comes as a senior Israeli official told the Hebrew news site that 'significant progress' has been made in hostage negotiation efforts, suggesting that Hamas could be willing to drop some of its war-long demands to reach an agreement. The official indicated that a deal could be reached within weeks. Netanyahu was one of the first world leaders to speak with Trump after the latter’s Nov. 5 election victory in the United States. The phone conversation, which lasted some 20 minutes, was described as 'warm and cordial.' The two men were said to have 'agreed to work together for Israel’s security and discussed the Iranian threat.' Trump’s transition team is weighing two main options to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, including preventative airstrikes, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing four people familiar with the plans. The military option was under 'more serious review' in the wake of the collapse of Assad’s regime and Israel’s decapitation of Hezbollah’s leadership in Lebanon, according to the report. אמרתי שנשנה את המזרח התיכון וזה מה שקורה. סוריה היא לא אותה סוריה. לבנון היא לא אותה לבנון. עזה היא לא אותה עזה. איראן היא לא אותה איראן. pic.twitter.com/IFVso1czkH &mdash; Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) December 15, 2024 The post Netanyahu talks hostage deal, Syria turmoil with Trump appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/netanyahu-talks-hostage-deal-syria-turmoil-with-trump/	2024-12-15T09:53:59-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-3-880x495-1.jpg
Satellite intel exposes Iran’s new warship amid wave of East Coas...	Satellite photos have captured Iran’s newest drone carrier sailing in formation with its predecessors – the helicopter-ready Shahid Roudaki and the heavily armed Shahid Mahdavi. By Jewish Breaking News As federal authorities struggle to explain dozens of drone sightings along the East Coast, all eyes are on Iran’s newest maritime threat. Iran’s newest warship 'Shahid Bagheri' began its life as a humble container vessel, but satellite images reveal its remarkable transformation throughout 2023. When Maxar’s high-resolution cameras first captured the ship at Bandar Abbas’ ISOICO shipyard in February, workers were already stripping the commercial ship down to its bones. By mid-November, the vessel had an angled flight deck and distinctive jump ramp that gave it the look of a miniature aircraft carrier, though one built specifically for launching drones. Within just two weeks, the crew had moved their creation to the shipyard’s harbor, and it finally departed in November 2024 for its first sea trials. The Shahid Bagheri isn’t navigating the Persian Gulf alone. Recent Maxar satellite photos have captured Iran’s newest drone carrier sailing in formation with its predecessors – the helicopter-ready Shahid Roudaki and the heavily armed Shahid Mahdavi, which joined Iran’s fleet last March, according to Business Insider. Together, they represent Iran’s growing fleet of drone-carrying vessels, each modified from civilian ships for military purposes. Satellite images of Iranian ships. (Screenshot) Dozens of drone sightings across New Jersey since mid-November have drawn attention due to their proximity to sensitive locations, including Picatinny Arsenal military research facility and President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster golf course. Despite denials by the Pentagon, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security, Congressman Jeff Van Drew doubled down Thursday on his claims that Iran is manning the drones. 'This is not the work of a backyard hobbyist,' he declared, adding that he was 'not trying to alarm people' but his information comes from 'high-level, credible sources, people with expertise and clearance to address real threats.' 'Drones are flying into United States air space, coming in and out of international waters,' Van Drew continued, claiming the drones were 'expertly piloted' to evade radar detection. 'We know there is an Iranian drone ship that went missing from its port. And the timing of the disappearance is circumstantially consistent with the beginning of the appearance of these drones. These drones are reportedly the size of minivans,' he said.

'This is about restoring Palestinian control in Judea and Samaria and eventually Gaza,' the official stated, emphasizing the importance of demonstrating governance capacity to international stakeholders, particularly the United States.

By Jewish Breaking News For over 14 months, major American carriers have remained conspicuously absent from Israel’s skies despite a ceasefire with Hezbollah and military gains against Hamas. One U.S. lawmaker who will soon take up the position of chairman on the Senate’s Transportation Committee believes it’s intentional. 'The Biden-Harris administration was lax in pursuing why some airlines will not fly to Israel,' Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tells Jewish Insider. 'Indeed, they may have been worse than lax, and the State Department may have become inappropriately entangled in deliberations over safety and subverted the Federal Aviation Administration.' 'There have been allegations about antisemitic discrimination by airlines and that calls by unions not to fly to Israel were motivated solely by pro-Hamas activists,' he said. 'These allegations are troubling, and, of course, American law prohibits American companies from participating in politically motivated boycotts of Israel,' noting that he 'welcomes a full investigation of these issues.' Operating without competition, El Al commands a staggering 71% of all passenger traffic through Ben Gurion airport on U.S. routes. Delta Airlines has teased an April 2025 return to Israeli skies, and negotiations are still ongoing with Israir and Arkia in leasing a few aircraft to provide North American service. Obviously, a clear divide has emerged between airline unions’ safety assessments and Israeli aviation authorities. 'Flights to Israel are safe,' says Israel’s aviation chief Shmuel Zakai. 'When we think that the airspace is not safe for flights, we close it. That earned us a lot of credit internationally.' Meanwhile, several European carriers are gradually returning to Israeli airspace, with Aegean Airlines leading the way after resuming flights last week.

Israel eliminates dozens of Hamas terrorists in Beit Hanoun	A separate raid eliminated a Hamas squad planning attacks on Israeli forces. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli soldiers eliminated dozens of Palestinian terrorists in Beit Hanoun, an area of northern Gaza where Hamas has been trying to regroup, the Israel Defense Forces disclosed on Sunday. The raid was based on intelligence about the presence of Hamas in the area. Dozens were killed by airstrikes and ground forces, while others were arrested. Israeli forces discovered and destroyed numerous weapons, including explosives and cluster munitions. A separate raid eliminated a Hamas squad planning attacks on Israeli forces. In addition, Air Force jets on Sunday also struck a Hamas command and control complex that previously served as a health clinic, the IDF said, adding that many weapons were stored there. The army said it took steps to mitigate harming civilians, including using precision weapons and aerial surveillance. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Israeli Foreign Minister orders shuttering of Israel's embassy in Dublin, more than half a year after Jerusalem recalled its ambassador to Ireland following its recognition of unilateral Palestinian statehood. By World Israel News Staff Israel is poised to close its embassy in Ireland, the country's foreign affairs chief announced Sunday, as the diplomatic row between the two countries continues. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar (New Hope) castigated what he called the 'extreme anti-Israel policy of the Irish government,' blaming Dublin for the chilly relations between the two countries. 'The antisemitic actions and rhetoric that Ireland is taking against Israel are based on delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state and on double standards,' Sa’ar said in a statement Sunday. 'Ireland has crossed all red lines in its relationship with Israel. Israel will invest its resources in promoting bilateral relations with the countries of the world according to priorities that are also derived from the attitude of the various countries towards it.' Sa'ar spoke out days after the Irish cabinet voted last week to join South Africa's petition to the International Criminal Court in The Hague accusing Israel of committing acts of genocide in the Gaza Strip during its ongoing war against the Hamas terror organization. In his announcement Sunday, Sa'ar also said Israel is preparing to open a new embassy in Moldova, replacing the existing facility. The foreign minister compared the downgrading of diplomatic ties with Ireland to the upgrade Israel's mission to Moldova is set to receive. 'There are countries that are interested in strengthening their ties with Israel and do not yet have an Israeli embassy,' Sa’ar said. 'We will adjust the Israeli diplomatic structure of our missions while giving weight, among other things, to the approach and actions of the various countries towards Israel in the political arena.'

Former Israeli state attorney sparks storm after calling on reser...	Moshe Lador had said air force reservists shouldn’t fly if the judicial overhaul process restarts. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel’s top leaders from across the political spectrum and the army slammed Saturday ex-state attorney Moshe Lador's call for air force reservists to refuse to fly if the judicial overhaul process restarts. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that disobeying a call to serve during wartime 'crosses a red line that endangers democracy and undermines our future.' Both he and Justice Minister Yariv Levin asked Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara to 'take immediate action.' 'Calling for insubordination, during normal times and even more so in times of war, is a clear and serious violation of the law,' Levin wrote in his letter to Baharav-Miara Saturday night. Considering Lador’s status as someone 'who was responsible for determining prosecution policy in the country,' and 'the concern that in the absence of enforcement of the law, the phenomenon of incitement to refusal and refusal itself will spread,' Levin said the attorney general had to quickly investigate the former senior official, who retired in 2013. President Isaac Herzog labeled the demand as being 'off-limits,' and said that 'Anyone who says otherwise harms the security of the State of Israel.' Top defense officials were quick to condemn Lador as well. Defense Minister Yisrael Katz said that 'Disobedience of any kind cannot be accepted under any circumstances,' while the man he replaced, Yoav Gallant, said that such a statement by someone who had held 'such a senior public position&#8230;harms the security of the state' and Lador must therefore be put on trial. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi called for an end to any calls for refusal to serve or failure to report for duty, saying that the IDF 'must remain outside any political controversy, especially these days, when security challenges are so tangible.' Lador had addressed an event in Beersheba earlier on Saturday and bluntly said, 'Pilots who have completed their compulsory service and now serve on a voluntary basis are not only allowed, but in my opinion, are practically obligated to say, ‘If that’s the kind of country you’re striving for, and are going to create through aggressiveness and bullying, and turn into dictators of&#8230;I won’t enter the cockpit and fly this plane.'' This was a 'legitimate tool' to stop the government, which he deemed completely 'wrong' in trying to curb the power of an unelected judiciary to overturn Knesset laws and government decisions, an issue which brought hundreds of thousands of protestors to the streets in the year before the Hamas-led invasion of Israel last October 7 that sparked the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. Leaders of the Opposition joined the many government ministers and MKs who also condemned Lador, including National Unity head Benny Gantz, Yesh Atid chief Yair Lapid, and Israel Beiteinu head Avigdor Liberman. While stating 'I am against all refusals and all evasion from IDF [service],' Lapid referred to those protests, blaming the government for 'dragging us back&#8230;to the days of the judicial revolution that brought us our greatest national disaster in our history.' Documents found in Gaza showed that Hamas leaders had taken the mass protests, as well as the hundreds of signatures of reservists on petitions stating that they would refuse to serve, as a sign of Israeli weakness and societal disintegration. After the terrorists massacred 1,200 people, including dozens of children, and took 251 hostage, the IDF saw well over 100% response to its emergency call-up, including air force personnel who had signed those petitions. Lador’s call came in response to Levin’s most recent refusal to allow the Judicial Selection Committee to vote on appointing a new Supreme Court president, a position that is currently empty. He does not want to follow the tradition of selecting the most senior judge because he prefers a more conservative candidate. The High Court of Justice just ordered Levin on Thursday to hold the vote within five weeks, infuriating the justice minister with what he termed their 'over-reach' into the executive branch’s responsibilities, and their desire to be 'dictatorial rulers' even though no one elected them to power.

Supreme Court forcing return of judicial reform, says Justice Min...	Israel's Justice Minister, Yariv Levin, the architect of the abortive 2023 judicial reform plan, hints at new bid to pass the reform, accusing Supreme Court of running roughshod over Knesset's and government's rights. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Israeli government and the country’s Supreme Court may be on a collision course which could result in another attempt to reform the judiciary and restore the balance of powers between the three branches of government, Israel’s Justice Minister said Saturday night. More than a year after the war in Gaza forced the government’s judicial reform plan off the agenda, and a year and a half since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu froze efforts to move forward with the reform in the face of large-scale protests, Justice Minister Yariv Levin (Likud) suggested over the weekend that Israel’s Supreme Court may force the Coalition to again take up his shelved reform plan. On Saturday night, Levin published a lengthy Facebook post accusing the Supreme Court of running roughshod over the rights of the country’s legislative and executive branches. Levin and the high court have clashed for over a year on the appointment of new justices, as well as the naming of a new chief justice, for the Supreme Court. Under Israeli law, the judicial appointment committee – responsible for appointing judges at all levels of the judiciary – is made up of nine voting members, of whom four come from the Knesset and the government (including the Justice Minister), along with three sitting Supreme Court justices (including the chief justice), and two members of the Israel Bar Association. While most appointments require only a simple majority of five out of nine members, appointments to the high court require a supermajority of seven, requiring at least some level of support from both the Supreme Court’s delegation and the governing coalition, which controls at least three seats on the committee. Since 2023, the court and the government have remained deadlocked over the appointment of three new Supreme Court justices, and the naming of a new chief justice. The last chief justice, Esther Hayut, finished her term in October 2023, with no replacement named to fill the position. Justice Uzi Vogelman declined offers to replace Hayut, given that his remaining term on the court was one year. Vogelman took over Hayut’s duties, however, as acting chief justice for one year, before leaving the court this October. Since then, Yitzhak Amit has served as acting chief justice. The court has pushed to formally appoint Amit as Hayut’s successor, citing his seniority on the bench. The Israeli government, however, has refused to back his appointment, noting that there is no statutory requirement to appoint the most senior justice to head the court. Amit is widely associated with the court’s liberal wing, raising concerns in Israel’s right-wing government. As a compromise, Levin has proposed to have the committee appoint conservative-leaning justice Yosef Elron as chief justice for a single year, after which he would be replaced by the court’s choice; likely Amit. Under the compromise, the government and the court would each nominate two justices, with the committee backing one appointment from each list, with the third vacancy to be filled by a female judge acceptable to both sides. However, acting chief justice Vogelman, and his successor, Amit, rejected the proposal, while the court moved to strip Levin of his authority as justice minister. 'Immediately after the outbreak of the war, the coalition announced a freeze on all activity related to judicial reform,' Levin wrote. 'At the time, I believed it was inappropriate to address contentious issues while the country was engaged in a multi-front war.' 'Minutes after I sent my proposal to Judge Vogelman, he rejected it contemptuously without even discussing it. Judge Vogelman was well aware that I was open to discussing the details of the proposal. The current Acting Chief Justice, Judge Yitzhak Amit, also knows this. However, they chose to entrench themselves in their refusal.' 'Several months ago, the Supreme Court, in a panel led by Justice Willner, ruled that my role as Minister of Justice would be in title only. Justice Willner issued an order that effectively stripped me of my statutory authority to determine the agenda of the Judicial Selection Committee, thereby invalidating the consensus-based process that had so far achieved an unprecedented number of appointments.' The ruling, Levin wrote, 'is patently unlawful;' nevertheless the minister continued to cooperate with the court, he claimed. Levin noted that in addition, the court took the unprecedented step of striking down an amendment to Israel’s Basic Laws – a proto-constitutional set of documents the Supreme Court has claimed have the status of a de facto constitution. Since then, the Supreme Court has attempted to force through the appointment of Amit as chief justice. 'The judges and representatives of the Bar Association blocked the broadcasting of the committee’s deliberations, allowing them to appoint Judge Amit behind closed doors, ignoring the many objections and difficult questions raised.' 'The Court did not stop there — since the war began, it has deliberated on the conditions of the terrorists who perpetrated the October 7 massacre, on humanitarian aid to Hamas in Gaza, on potentially ordering the state to release the bodies of terrorists while our hostages languish in Hamas tunnels, and on many other issues. This evening, it was revealed that Justice Ruth Ronen even visited Ofer Prison to personally oversee the detention conditions of high-ranking terrorists.' Given the situation, Levin said the government is now compelled to return to the judicial reform. 'The Court is leaving the Knesset and the government no choice but to act at this time to restore their powers.' 'They have left us no choice. This cannot continue. We, too, have rights.'

Post-Assad era opens door for recovery of legendary Israeli spy	Beyond the search for Cohen’s remains, Israeli negotiators are also reportedly pursuing a broader agenda that includes locating missing soldiers from the First Lebanon War. By Jewish Breaking News A rare opportunity for Israel has presented itself following the ouster of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. According to the Lebanese-based Al-Akhbar newspaper, Israel is holding negotiations with Syrian and international bodies in an attempt to locate the body of legendary spy Eli Cohen. Cohen’s espionage career stands as one of the most remarkable chapters in Israeli intelligence history. Born in Alexandria to Syrian Jewish parents, he possessed a natural gift for languages, speaking Arabic, English, and French fluently. After receiving initial espionage training in Israel in 1955, he returned to Egypt, only to be expelled along with other Jews in the wake of the Suez Crisis. He subsequently settled in Israel in 1957, working as a translator and accountant before being recruited again by Israeli intelligence in 1960. In 1961, Cohen was dispatched to Buenos Aires by the Mossad under the alias Kamal Amin Thaabet, posing as an expatriate Syrian businessman. There, he methodically built relationships within the Syrian expatriate community, including future Syrian president Amin al-Hafez. These connections proved invaluable when Cohen relocated to Damascus in 1962, where he rapidly ascended into the highest circles of Syrian society and government. His influence peaked during the 1963 Ba’athist coup, when several of his Argentine contacts seized power. So trusted was Cohen that al-Hafez reportedly considered him for deputy minister of defense. He attended classified military briefings and was granted access to strategic Syrian fortifications in the Golan Heights, all while transmitting crucial intelligence back to Israel. Despite repeated warnings from his handlers, Cohen maintained regular radio transmission schedules. Syrian counterintelligence eventually traced his signal and arrested him in January 1965. Following a military trial, he was publicly hanged in Damascus’s Marjeh Square four months later. To keep his remains out of Israeli hands, Syrian authorities have purportedly moved Cohen’s body multiple times over the years. Beyond the search for Cohen’s remains, Israeli negotiators are also reportedly pursuing a broader agenda that includes locating missing soldiers from the First Lebanon War. While Zachary Baumel’s remains were returned to Israel in 2019, the whereabouts of Yehuda Katz and Zvi Feldman, who died during the 1982 Battle of Sultan Yaaqoub, remain unknown. The negotiations also touch on Syria’s Jewish heritage, with Israel seeking to preserve what remains of the community’s historic sites and cultural treasures. According to Al-Akhbar, roughly half of Syria’s Jewish sites have been destroyed, and numerous sacred artifacts, including ancient Torah scrolls, have vanished. Some of these religious items have since surfaced in Turkey.

What happened to relics of Syria’s Jewish history? Assad’s collap...	By 2020, nearly half of Syria’s Jewish sites were destroyed, according to a report from the Foundation for Jewish Heritage. By Shira Li Bartov, JTA The fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has opened up a sea of uncertainty about Syria’s future — and about the treasures of its past, including the remnants of its Jewish history. A 13-year civil war has cost the country more than 600,000 lives and saw some 100,000 people 'forcibly disappeared' into prisons by the Assad regime. The war has also wreaked havoc on Syria’s most important cultural sites — from ancient monuments, castles and mosques to the vestiges of a rich Jewish culture. Well before the war, Syria’s historical synagogues and other Jewish sites languished in neglect after Jews left the country en masse surrounding Israel’s establishment. Now, archaeologists are beginning to assess how much more was lost to bombardment and wartime looting. Syria was home to well-established Jewish communities for more than 2,000 years, dating back to the Roman period, including Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain in 1492 and European Jewish merchants. But the 20th-century rise of Arab nationalist movements, along with a set of anti-Jewish laws and violence surrounding the establishment of Israel, resulted in waves of Jewish emigration. About 100,000 Jews lived in Syria at the start of the 20th century, dropping to 15,000 in 1947. An anti-Jewish riot that year, followed by the creation of Israel in 1948, spurred many of the remaining Jews to leave — though they were not legally permitted to do so in most cases despite facing persecution in Syria. The Aleppo Codex, a landmark 10th-century copy of the Hebrew Bible, was damaged and secreted out of the country to Israel around that time. By 1992, when Assad’s father acceded to pressure to let the Jews emigrate, there were about 4,000 Jews remaining in Aleppo and smaller numbers in Damascus and Qamishli. Most left the country shortly afterwards. In 2011, a now-infamous Vogue profile of Asma al-Assad, Bashar’s wife, quoted her as saying that Jews fit into her vision of religious diversity in Syria. 'There is a very big Jewish quarter in old Damascus,' she told the interviewer, who noted that homes in the quarter had been boarded up since the 1992 exodus. (The article was removed from the internet after drawing criticism for sanitizing the wife of a dictator, and his regime, but remains accessible in an archived form.) In 2022, an estimate of Syria’s Jews counted only four; this year, the widely circulating number is three. Many Jewish sites have had no caretakers for decades, said Emma Cunliffe, an archaeologist with the Cultural Property Protection and Peace team at Newcastle University. 'In a conflict situation, that neglect intensifies,' said Cunliffe. 'Those few people who remained to look after them were then unable to reach them. But then as the war progressed, the damage increased significantly.' By 2020, nearly half of Syria’s Jewish sites were destroyed, according to a report from the Foundation for Jewish Heritage. The Jobar Synagogue in Damascus, one of few Jewish places of worship still visited by a handful of elderly Jews before the war, was mostly turned into rubble in 2014. A host of ancient Torah scrolls, tapestries, chandeliers and other artifacts from the synagogue went missing, with some resurfacing in Turkey. The al-Bandara Synagogue, one of the oldest synagogues in Aleppo, also suffered damage during heavy fighting in the region. The synagogue had been renovated in the 1990s but was damaged again during the civil war in 2016. Cunliffe, who conducted a study of the site in 2017, said some parts of the building were destroyed and its courtyard was littered with debris. (A recent virtual reality exhibition at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem allowed visitors to explore the famed synagogue as it stood in 1947, using photographs taken by a local woman who later emigrated.) Tadef, a town east of Aleppo, was once a popular destination for Jews because of its shrine to the Jewish scribe and prophet Ezra, who was said to stop there on his way to Jerusalem. But after a long period of neglect, the shrine was illegally excavated and looted both by rebel groups and Syrian government forces between 2021 and 2022, according to the rights group Syrians for Truth and Justice. Scholars also worry about the ruins of Roman-era synagogues in Syria’s ancient cities, such as Apamea and Dura-Europos. Satellite imaging has shown that Dura-Europos was heavily looted while being held by Islamic State forces, according to Adam Blitz, a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Remnants from the synagogue of Dura-Europos are treasured by museums, including the Yale University Art Gallery, which displays 40 tiles from the synagogue’s ceiling. But Blitz said other artifacts from the site are feared to have been pilfered by combatants. 'There has been tremendous fear about mosaics being looted,' he said of Syria’s ancient sites. The extent of the damage to Jewish sites is still difficult to assess, according to Cunliffe, who said the skills and training needed for forensic damage collection remain limited in the war-torn country. Investigations through satellite imagery will also take several months. It may take much longer to establish protection for these sites, as Syria’s cultural sector has been overlooked during the war and the Syrian Antiquities Authority has been consigned to a tiny budget. As Syria hurtles into a new era, the fate of its heritage sites hangs in the balance. The country’s gems of Jewish history will only survive as far as its next regime allows, said Cunliffe. The new regime has its roots in Islamic fundamentalist movements but in recent years has taken a pragmatic turn, leaving open questions about the fate of minorities and their interests under its governance. 'Support for the people who are in a position to access them and protect them is critical, and also the need for an inclusive society that will allow that to happen,' Cunliffe said about the historic Jewish sites. 'We don’t know what the future of Syria looks like. Certainly, there’s a lot of fighting, and which group ultimately wins will dictate a lot of what is possible.'

Report: Trump’s Mideast envoy meets with Saudi crown prince	In November, Saudi Arabia reiterated its position that the kingdom will not formalize relations with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state. By JNS U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff met with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia last week for talks on a 'mega-deal' with Riyadh, including a historic peace accord with Israel, Axios reported on Friday. Witkoff, a Jewish businessman and longtime friend to Trump, held a series of diplomatic discussions during a recent trip to the Middle East that culminated in a visit to Abu Dhabi for a crypto conference. According to Axios, the Biden administration sought a U.S.-Saudi defense treaty as well as an agreement on civilian nuclear cooperation between the countries. Ratification of the treaty by the Senate would have been more likely had it included a peace agreement between Riyadh and Jerusalem. Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 onslaught on Israel’s south and the subsequent wars in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, however, derailed the negotiations. One major obstacle to normalization is Riyadh’s demand for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his senior advisers believe that under Trump and with the Jewish state’s successful campaigns against Iran and its proxies in the region, the Saudis might be convinced to forgo this condition, according to Axios. In November, Saudi Arabia reiterated its position that the kingdom will not formalize relations with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state, asserting that some deals it is negotiating with the United States are 'not that connected' to Washington’s normalization drive. Riyadh is 'quite happy' to wait until the situation in the Gaza Strip is 'amenable' before normalizing ties with the Jewish state, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said at an investment summit. He added that U.S.-Saudi trade and technology deals are 'not tied to any third parties' and can potentially progress 'quite quickly.' Recent reports suggested that a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip could be reached before Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. According to The Wall Street Journal, Hamas has agreed to two of Israel’s key conditions for a ceasefire in Gaza, raising hopes for an agreement to release Israeli hostages within days. Hamas for the first time agreed to accept the presence of Israeli forces in Gaza during a 60-day truce, the newspaper quoted unnamed Arab mediators as saying. The sources also confirmed to the paper reports from earlier in the week that Hamas had submitted a list of hostages, including U.S. citizens, whom it would release. The purported breakthrough follows a Dec. 3 threat by Trump that there would be 'hell to pay' unless the hostages were freed by the time he assumed office on Jan. 20. Hamas terrorists murdered roughly 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in the deadliest single-day attack in the Jewish state’s history. The Islamist group also kidnapped 251 individuals into the Palestinian enclave, where about 100 still remain—although it is not known how many are alive.

Rebel leader: Israel has no more ‘excuses’ to strike Syria	Abu Mohammad al-Julani said, 'We are currently working to meet Syrians’ primary needs. We are not seeking to engage in any conflict given Syria’s fragile state, and we are addressing the international community.' By JNS Syria’s new leader said on Saturday that Israel’s 'excuses' had run out for striking the deposed Assad regime’s military infrastructure, as well as for deploying troops to several demilitarized zones in the Syrian Golan Heights. 'Excuses have run out, and they have crossed the lines of engagement,' said head of the Syrian Islamist group (HTS) Ahmad al-Sharaa, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Julani. Although reports conflicted as to whether he mentioned Israel by name, it was clear that al-Julani’s statements to Syrian state media were aimed at Jerusalem, noting that his group’s sovereignty over most of Syria has ended Iranian intervention in the country and that it is not seeking further conflict. On Nov. 27, a coalition of rebel groups—HTS chief among them—toppled Bashar Assad’s regime in an 11-day armed uprising, reportedly with the backing of Turkey. In response, the Israeli Air Force has waged a massive air campaign against Syrian military targets to make sure they can’t be used against the Jewish state. The operation has seen hundreds of IAF aircraft striking key Syrian military installations, severely damaging what was once one of the strongest air defense systems in the Middle East. On Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson’s Unit said the air force has succeeded in destroying an estimated 90% of Syria’s strategically important surface-to-air missiles. Speaking to the media on Saturday, al-Julani said, 'We are currently working to meet Syrians’ primary needs. We are not seeking to engage in any conflict given Syria’s fragile state, and we are addressing the international community.' He added, 'The Syrian revolution has triumphed, but Syria cannot be governed with a revolutionary mindset. There is a need for law and institutions, and for transitioning from the mentality of revolution to the mentality of statehood.' Speaking about Tehran’s influence over Syria in the past decades, al-Julani said, 'We successfully ended the Iranian presence and hold no hostility toward the Iranian people.' Later on Saturday, Syrian media reported that Israeli airstrikes had resumed in the Damascus area. Israel targeted sites in the town of Hafir in the area of al-Qalamoun, in the countryside of Damascus, according to Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group. Meanwhile, the IDF stated that it was continuing its defense mission in the Syrian buffer zone and along the border with engineering, armor, paratroopers and special reconnaissance troops. 'The forces are deployed at commanding points that control the buffer zone and strengthen the defense in the area,' the IDF said. 'We have no interest in anything that is currently going on in Syria,' said Col. Benny Kata, commander of the 474th Golan Regional Brigade. The IDF’s purpose in Syria is to protect the Israeli residents of the Golan, he added. On the Syrian side, the brigade found a large amount of arms, including anti-tank missiles, weapons, vests, ammunition and other military equipment, according to the IDF. In a three-day visit to Israel that started on Wednesday, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) commander Gen. Michael Kurilla met with Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz and senior members of the Israeli defense establishment to discuss regional security issues, including the developing situation in Syria and 'preparedness against other strategic and regional threats.' Kurilla said, 'My visit to Israel, as well as Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon over the past six days, reinforced the importance of seeing the current challenges and opportunities firsthand through the eyes of our partners, commanders on the ground, and servicemembers. We need to maintain strong partnerships to confront current and future threats to the region.'

Israel prepares to strike Houthi targets in Yemen	The Houthis have been provoking the IDF, which has been preoccupied with more immediate and pressing conflicts; however, with Syria largely stabilized, the IDF can now redirect its focus to Yemen. By Lilach Shoval, JNS The Israeli Air Forces remains uncertain whether Yemen’s Houthi rebels launched three or four unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) toward Israel on Thursday morning. What is clear, however, is that the Houthis have increased their attempts to challenge Israel in recent days. One of the drones was intercepted near Eilat, another was downed using soft-kill methods and a third disappeared from radar and has yet to be located. According to Israel Defense Forces assessments, the escalation of Houthi attacks is partly due to the significant blows sustained in recent weeks by Iran’s 'axis of evil,' with the Houthis attempting to exploit the situation to assume a leading role. Israeli officials acknowledge that the situation cannot continue and are preparing for the possibility of a third significant strike against Houthi targets in Yemen. Evaluating strikes on the Syrian military In Syria, The IDF continues to analyze the results of its strikes on Syrian military assets. Current estimates indicate that 58% to 88% of Syria’s air defense systems have been critically damaged. While IDF briefings have suggested that around 80% of Assad’s military has been damaged, senior officers caution that this figure is overly ambitious and advise more conservative estimates. According to their analyses, overall damage to Syria’s military capabilities is lower, as intelligence does not cover every weapon system. The operation in Syria involved the use of 1,800 munitions—none of which had been part of initial plans. The decision was made to focus on high-value assets. Since the beginning of the conflict on Oct. 7, 2023, the IAF has deployed approximately 83,000 munitions across all combat zones. The IDF’s rapid response in Syria stemmed from the evolving dynamics of the country’s civil war. When rebel offensives raised doubts about Assad’s survival, the IDF prepared plans to target remaining Syrian military assets in rebel-held areas. In just 48 hours, the IAF struck over 500 targets in Syria. The strikes destroyed more than 85% of Syria’s air defense systems and 40% of Assad’s fighter jets. Additionally, 100% of Syria’s armed drones and 390 artillery positions were eliminated. The timing of the operation posed a key dilemma. On one hand, Israel sought to avoid being seen as interfering in Syria’s internal affairs. On the other, action was necessary before certain weapon systems disappeared or were relocated. Before the strikes, Russian forces had numerous air defense systems in Syria, but now only a few remain. According to IDF data, the following Syrian air defense systems have been destroyed: • SA-2 and SA-3 batteries (100% destroyed) • SA-22 and SA-6 systems (86%) • SA-17 batteries (80%) • SA-8 systems (77%) • SA-26 systems (66%) Overall, 86% of Syria’s air defense systems have been neutralized, enabling the IAF to operate almost freely over Syrian territory. In the past, strikes were conducted from a distance using long-range munitions. Now, the destruction of 100% of Syria’s armed drones, along with 90% of its MiG-39 and 80% of its Su-24 fighter jets, ensures greater operational flexibility. The IDF also targeted sites believed to house chemical weapons, but intelligence gaps suggest that some stockpiles may remain undetected. Escalating threats on Israel’s northern front Since the start of the war, over 22,000 rockets and missiles have been fired at Israel, including 12,300 since the launch of 'Operation Northern Arrows' against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Of these, 900 rockets landed in Israel, though only 12 caused significant damage. The IDF reports a 91% interception success rate. UAV threats persist as well. Since the conflict began, 648 UAVs have been launched at Israel, including 239 since 'Operation Northern Arrows' commenced. While 94% have been intercepted, the remaining threats continue to trigger sirens and unsettle the public. Israeli strikes have targeted all land crossings between Lebanon and Syria except the main route between Beirut and Damascus. The objective: preventing the transfer of weapons from Iran to Hezbollah or the movement of remaining Syrian military assets. However, it is likely some smuggling routes remain active and undetected by Israeli intelligence. Looking ahead, 2025 is expected to center on Iran, with the Israeli defense establishment preparing for potential conflict with Tehran and its regional proxies. The IDF continues to strengthen its readiness for addressing the Iranian threat at all levels.

Governor’s race preview? Ritchie Torres holds higher approval rat...	Only 33 percent of New Yorkers stated that they plan on voting for incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) in 2026, indicating her vulnerability. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner A recent Siena College poll found that Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) holds a higher approval rating among Jewish registered voters in New York State than Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), setting the stage for an expected race for the governor’s mansion in 2026 between the two US lawmakers. Torres enjoys a 41 percent approval rating among New York Jews, compared to an 8 percent disapproval rating, the poll showed. Comparatively, Lawler, who is Jewish himself, holds a 31 percent approval rating and 24 percent disapproval rating among Jews in the state. Both Torres and Lawler are widely expected to throw their hat in the ring for the 2026 New York gubernatorial election. While the Siena College poll found that about half the electorate either didn’t know the lawmakers or didn’t have an opinion of them, only 33 percent of New Yorkers stated that they plan on voting for incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) in 2026, indicating her vulnerability. Torres, whose district represents large swaths of the Bronx, has been increasingly critical of Hochul, lambasting her for supposedly being a political 'insider' who lacks the fortitude to combat corruption within The Empire State. He has also called Hochul a 'hypocrite' for switching her positions on gun rights and congestion pricing. Moreover, since his arrival in Congress, Torres has been highly outspoken against antisemitism, oftentimes criticizing fellow liberals over their unwillingness to combat bigotry against the Jewish community. He has relentlessly criticized local universities such as New York University (NYU) and Columbia University for fostering campus environments which condone antisemitic conduct from faculty and students. He has called on local universities to amend their non-discrimination policies to include 'Zionist' students as a protected identity. Lawler, who represents New York’s 17th Congressional District, has also been floated as a potential contender for the New York governorship. Lawler slammed Hochul after the governor announced an 'inflation check' program, which would send $300 dollars to New Yorkers making up to $150,000 per year and $300 to families making $300,000 per year. T he lawmaker has also criticized Hochul over her refusal to aggressively tackle surging crime and violence within the state. 'It should come as no surprise that the most incompetent Governor in New York’s history isn’t capable of reading a balance sheet,' Lawler said recently. 'But it is sad that Governor Hochul feels the need to lie to New Yorkers about how her political ‘vote-for-me’ checks are being paid for.' Like Torres, Lawler has positioned himself as a stalwart ally of Israel since entering Congress, oftentimes spearheading bills to combat antisemitism both domestically and abroad. Lawler has also sponsored legislation to target countries and entities that treat Israel unfairly, such as the 'Stand With Israel Act,' which would defund United Nations agencies that 'expel, downgrade, suspend, or otherwise restrict the participation of the State of Israel.'

Judge bars release of CIA leaker of Israel’s plans to attack Iran	A federal court agreed with the prosecution that Asif Rahman posed a danger to the community and a flight risk if he was allowed pre-trial detention at home. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A federal judge rejected Wednesday defense calls for the pre-trial release of a CIA employee charged with leaking Israel’s plans to attack Iran in October. Asif Rahman will be standing trial on two counts of violating the Espionage Act by willfully retaining classified information and transmitting it to an unauthorized person on or about October 17. A lower court had permitted his release to home detention with GPS monitoring, but in a one-hour proceeding, U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles overturned the decision, siding with the prosecution that Rahman posed a flight risk and a danger to the community. 'It is hard to overstate what other circumstances present graver risks of danger to human life than unilaterally deciding to transmitting information related to plans for kinetic military action between two countries,' prosecutors wrote in court papers. Giles accepted their position that Rahman still knows top secret information by virtue of his former position that is relevant in Israel’s ongoing war with Iranian terror proxy Hamas, which he could reveal to the detriment of the U.S. and its closest Midde East ally. 'I take the government’s point that this is a kinetic situation. It’s a volatile situation … and that creates a different danger,' she said. 'It’s possible to limit someone’s computer access, but you can’t stop him from talking,' Giles added, after the defense had raised the possibility of denying him all access to electronic devices. Israel had reportedly delayed its retaliatory strike due to the leak, following Iran’s second attempt earlier in the month to wreak massive havoc on the Jewish state by launching nearly 200 missiles and UAVs at the country. Rahman allegedly had leaked documents including satellite photos of possible Israeli targets in Iran that had been prepared by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, to a Telegram account run out of the Islamic Republic. The information also included a report by the National Security Agency on Israeli military preparations for the mission, including what air force planes and missiles could be used. The Israelis ultimately carried out the attack at the end of October and destroyed most of Iran’s advanced aerial defense systems, as well as an active top secret nuclear weapons research facility. Prosecutors also noted that as Rahman comes from a very wealthy family, it would be relatively easy of him to flee the country if he was to await trial at home. The suspect's wealthy background also strengthened the prosecution's claim that his motives must be ideological in some way that they did not specify, rather than financial. Rahman was arrested on November 12 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where he was a member of the American embassy staff. The federal agents found eight pages of notes on him, including a 'to-do list,' much of which was encrypted and has yet to be deciphered. Another such list openly enumerated such categories as 'Contingencies' and 'Run.' The 34-year-old agent has pled not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have already said that they would appeal Giles’ decision.

Fearing Hamas coup, PA battles terror groups in Jenin	Palestinian Authority forces kill Jenin Brigades terrorist, sparking condemnation from Hamas. By World Israel News Staff The Palestinian Authority's security forces launched a deadly counter-terror operation in Jenin, against the backdrop of fears that Hamas is gearing up for a coup that would wrest control of territory from the PA to the terror group. On Saturday, intense gunbattles were reported in the city, long known as a hotbed for terror, as PA forces targeted local terror groups. PA spokesperson Brigadier General Anwar Rajab said that the raid, dubbed 'Operation Protect the Homeland,' aimed to 'eradicate sedition and chaos' within PA-administered enclaves in Judea and Samaria. 'These [terror] groups do not represent the nation and they operate&#8230;outside of morality and the historical and national struggle of the Palestinians – behind these groups stands a force that aims to harm Palestinian stability and the peace of the residents,' Rajab staid in a statement on Saturday. 'Unfortunately, we are facing a group that has sold itself for cheap material benefits and is carrying out ISIS-like acts that do not represent the Palestinian people.' According to Arabic-language reports, the PA security forces 'stormed' Ibn Sina Hospital, surrounded another medical center, and searched ambulances, apparently in an attempt to detain terrorists who had been wounded in the firefights. The commander of the Jenin Brigades terror group, Yazid Ja’ayseh, was said to have been killed in the clashes. The PA is reportedly withholding Ja'ayseh's body from his family, presumably out of concern that a mass funeral for the slain terrorists would spark further unrest. Hamas, which is allied with the Jenin Brigades, condemned the killing of the 'martyr leader' as 'shameful,' warning that his death would 'fuel internal disputes.' The Popular Resistance Committee, an umbrella group of terror organizations, slammed the PA in a statement about Ja’ayseh’s killing. His slaying constitutes 'a serious violation of all national norms and traditions,' the group said, claiming that the PA was acting 'in line with the Zionist agenda that aims to eliminate the resistance in the West Bank.'

Gaza civilian death toll massively inflated – report	Study finds Western media outlets unquestioningly accepted Hamas statistics, which massively inflated the number of civilian casualties in order to 'vilify Israel.' By World Israel News Staff Death toll estimates submitted by the Gaza health ministry have consistently exaggerated the number of civilian casualties inflicted during the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel a new report finds. According to the Gaza health ministry - administered under the supervision of the Hamas terror organization - there have been a total of 44,930 fatalities in the Gaza Strip as a result of armed hostilities with Israel over the 14 months since October 7th, 2023. Gaza health officials have claimed that the vast majority of those fatalities were civilians, with an analysis by the United Nations covering confirmed deaths during a six-month period early in the war suggesting that 70% of the dead were women and children. Western media outlets have echoed claims by the Gaza health ministry, including CNN's Fareed Zakaria stating on air that Israel's campaign against Hamas had 'resulted in 35,000 civilians dying.' However, a new study jointly conducted by the Fifty Global Research Group and Henry Jackson Society think-tank, has found that the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry's death toll data consistently marked the ages of those killed downward compared to their information as listed by the Palestinian Population Register - thus inflating the number of children killed in the conflict. 'This misclassification contributes to the narrative that civilian populations, particularly women and children, bear the brunt of the conflict, potentially influencing sentiment and media coverage,' said the study's lead author, Andrew Fox, in an interview with The Telegraph. In addition, the Gaza health ministry fallaciously included deaths unrelated to the war, counting some 5,000 natural deaths as war fatalities, the report claimed. These included cancer patients who were apparently still alive at the time of their alleged deaths from Israeli attacks, appearing on lists of those receiving hospital treatments, before dying later of their illnesses. The report also accused the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry of including deaths caused by misfired Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad rockets, attacks by Hamas terrorists against Gaza civilians, or other internecine violence in their list of fatalities from Israeli attacks. 'The ministry of health, operating under Hamas, has systematically inflated the death toll by failing to distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths, over-reporting fatalities among women and children and even including individuals who died before the conflict began,' the report said. 'This has led to a narrative where the Israel Defense Forces are portrayed as disproportionately targeting civilians, while the actual numbers suggest a significant proportion of the dead are combatants.' The United Nations too, the researchers said, is guilty of misrepresenting the data and conflating civilian and terrorist casualties. 'The omission creates a skewed narrative portraying all casualties as civilian, shaping public opinion and international policy based on incomplete or manipulated data . . with Israel accused of ‘genocide’, ‘ethnic cleansing’ and ‘crimes against humanity’,' the authors wrote. In contrast to the U.N. report, which assessed confirmed deaths from November 2023 through April 2024 and found that 70% were either women or children, the Fifty Global Research Group/Henry Jackson Society report determined that the majority of all war fatalities in Gaza occurred among males between the ages of 15 and 45. Analysing 1,378 news articles by major American and British outlets including CNN, the BBC, The New York Times, The Guardian, The Washington Post, ABC, Reuters, and The Associated Press, the study found a massively lop-sided reliance on Hamas statistics, often cited without question. The report shows that virtual all the articles assessed (98%) cited data provided by the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, while just 3% cited Israeli data. In this vein, few articles noted Israeli and American military estimates that of the Gaza war fatalities, some 17,000 were terrorists affiliated with Hamas - not including members of other terror groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Just 1% of the articles noted that the Hamas figures have not been independently verified. By comparison, a whopping 19% of articles examined cited the Hamas-backed data as established fact, without even noting the numbers were provided by the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.

Israeli intel fears Islamists may topple Jordan’s King Abdullah	Jordan-based terror groups have used the long land border between the two countries to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks. By World Israel News Staff Israeli intelligence agencies are concerned that Islamist rebels in Jordan could overthrow the Hashemite Kingdom's monarch, King Abdullah II, following the recenter ouster of longtime Syrian dictator Basher al-Assad. Top intelligence officials, including Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) Chief Ronen Bar and the head of the Israeli army's Intelligence Directorate, Maj.-Gen. Shlomi Binder, secretly visited Jordan on Friday to discuss the developments in the region, according to Hebrew-language media reports. Bar and Binder were met with the director of Jordan's national intelligence agency, Ahmed Husni, along with other senior officials. Jordan-based terror groups have used the long land border between the two countries to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks. Axios reported that the meetings were focused on security issues related to the Islamist groups now tasked with forming a transitional government in Syria, with Jordan serving as a mediator between the militas and Israeli government. While many Jordanian politicians are outwardly hostile to Israel, the country has maintained a cold peace with Jerusalem since 1994, and the two countries frequently collaborate on security issues. Jordan's cooperation with Israel, including allowing its airspace to be used to shoot down incoming Iranian missiles and rockets, has sparked backlash in the kingdom. Some 70 percent of Jordan's population are of Jordanian descent, while the king is a member of the Hashemite minority. Iran and Sunni extremists have long worked to stoke tribal tensions between the groups, with the goal of toppling the royal dynasty that has ruled Jordan for more than a century. Iran has recently ramped up its efforts to smuggle weapons to Palestinian terror groups in Judea and Samaria via Jordan, as well as exacerbating anti-monarchy sentiment in the country.

‘Whoever harms our hostages will pay’ – Netanyahu	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns Gaza terror group after it released its latest psychological warfare video, showing an unidentified Israeli captive with tattoos. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend warned Gaza terrorists holding Israelis captive in the Gaza Strip, vowing that anyone responsible for harming the hostages 'will pay the price.' On Saturday, a Telegram channel used by Hamas released a pair of psychological war videos, one of which featured glimpses of an Israeli captive held in Gaza. The video of the unidentified hostage highlighted the captive's tattoos, without additional signs or a few of the captive's face to enable positive identification. In the second video released by the Hamas Telegram channel, the terror group published a computer-generated video of Netanyahu digging graves in a cemetery filled with Israeli hostages. On Saturday night, Netanyahu responded to the videos, which he called 'cruel and malicious.' 'The onslaught of Hamas propaganda videos is cruel and malicious psychological warfare,' Netanyahu said, vowing anyone responsoble for harming the hostages will 'pay the price.' 'I am in continuous contact with the hostages' families who are enduring a terrible and prolonged nightmare.' 'I have said and I reiterate: Whoever harms our hostages – will pay the price. We will continue to work relentlessly for the return home of all of our male and female hostages, the living and the deceased.' Hamas released the videos as the terror group reportedly has softened its position on two key issues in the ongoing hostage deal talks with Israel. According to a report last week by The Wall Street Journal, Hamas has indicated to Israel, via Egypt, that it no longer demands the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip as part of ceasefire. Furthermore, Hamas is reportedly now willing to accept a continued Israeli presence in two key strategic areas in the Gaza Strip - the Philadelphi Corridor on the Egyptian border, and the Netzarim Corridor which divides north and south Gaza.

Hezbollah leader says terror group lost its supply route in Syria	During the Assad regime, weapons and other military supplies were brought through Syria into Lebanon. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem said in a the terror group lost its supply route in Syria with the fall of the Assad regime. During the Assad regime, weapons and other military supplies were brought through Syria into Lebanon, but when Syrian rebels seized the route, the supply chain was cut off. 'We also hope that the new ruling party will view Israel as an enemy and refrain from normalizing relations with it. These are the key factors that will shape the nature of the relationship between us and Syria.' Qassem also shared his view on Israel's ambitions, stating, 'The enemy aims to settle in Gaza and annex the West Bank, with full support from America, which backs it with all its resources.' 'Israeli crimes were meant to break the resistance, but they have failed,' Qassam said. 'These crimes are not a victory. We will never surrender or be humiliated, and this will not happen as long as Hezbollah's resistance remains strong.' Although the Hezbollah leader said he hopes the new Syrian government will consider Israel an enemy, the leader of Syrian rebel forces says he isn't seeking conflict with Israel. Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani insisted that he is not seeking conflict with Israel. 'We are not engaging in conflict with Israel,' he said. 'Israel is using the presence of Iranians as a pretext to invade Syria. Once the Iranians depart, there will be no justification for foreign interference in Syria.' Last week, al-Julani told CNN, 'The seeds of the regime's defeat have always been internal. The Iranians tried to revive it, buying it some time, and later the Russians also attempted to shore it up. But the reality remains: this regime is doomed.' He added, 'I believe that once this regime falls, the issue will be resolved, and there will be no need for foreign forces to remain in Syria. 'Syria deserves a system of governance based on institutions, not one where a single ruler makes arbitrary decisions.'

The IDF said that military actions, including the elimination of 85% of Syrian anti-aircraft missiles, may provide an opportunity to target Iran's nuclear program. Sources in the Israeli Air Force said they were preparing for action against Iran's nuclear sites and were enlisting the aid of the US. The IDF announced that it has struck 320 targets and destroyed at least 80% of Syria's military capabilities to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorist groups. More than 350 Israeli fighter jets took part in Operation 'Bashan's Arrow' to neutralize military sites once controlled by the Assad regime, which fell to rebel fighters. A secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin, located 19 miles southeast of Tehran, was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on October 26, according to a report from Axios. The facility housed advanced equipment used for testing explosives necessary to detonate nuclear devices, the report stated, citing three US officials, as well as one current and one former Israeli official.

Tel Dan Stele, oldest archaeological evidence of King David, come...	By Jackie Hajdenberg, JTA Last year, New York City’s Jewish Museum imported a new director from the Israel Museum. Now, it’s bringing the oldest archaeological evidence of the existence of King David from the Jerusalem museum, too. The Tel Dan Stele, a stone fragment long held exclusively by the Israel Museum, is on view at the Jewish Museum on the Upper East Side until Jan. 5. A 12-by-13 inch chunk of basalt, the Tel Dan Stele is a 9th-century BCE stone document acknowledging the military victories of a person whom scholars believe to be King Hazael of Aram, an area in contemporary Syria that includes what is today Damascus. One of those victories was over a descendant of David, the king of ancient Israel. When it was discovered in northern Israel in 1993, the Tel Dan Stele became the earliest evidence beyond the Bible that King David was a real figure. 'There is no archeological evidence surviving from the First Temple,' said James Snyder, who took the helm of the Jewish Museum a year ago. 'There is from the Second Temple, and that’s at the Israel Museum. From the First Temple, what therefore becomes important are these references to this archeological evidence of the time of the First Temple, and of evidence that reinforces biblical history.' The First Temple, believed to have been built by David’s son King Solomon in the 10th century BCE, was destroyed during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem in 586 CE. 'What makes the Tel Dan Stele so important is that it’s the oldest archeological evidence of the existence of the House of David, which is the sort of touchstone or fountainhead for the unfolding thereafter of Judaism, Christianity and then Islam,' Snyder added. In fact, it’s so old that the Aramaic used in the stele was still being written in the Phoenician alphabet — a language that predates Aramaic. The ancient inscription refers to the 'House of David,' in translation saying, '[I killed Jeho]ram son of [Ahab] king of Israel, and [I] killed [Ahaz]iahu son of [Jehoram kin]g of the House of David.' Before coming to the Jewish Museum, the stele was on display for nearly two months at a biblical archaeology museum in Oklahoma. It was previously displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, just blocks from the Jewish Museum, a decade ago. (A replica is also on display at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C.) On view at the Jewish Museum — which recently opened an on-site kosher restaurant, filling the space left vacant by Russ & Daughters during the pandemic — only a few weeks, Snyder says the stele is a treasure for the institution, which he said is increasingly aiming to draw connections between Jewish history and material culture and contemporary art. Snyder said the loan had been in the works for a few years — beginning while he ran the Israel Museum — but added that it feels particularly timely to have it in the museum after the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. 'The House of David has equal importance to the three monotheistic faiths that percolated in the region over 1,500 years,' Snyder said. 'So it’s from Judaism to Christianity to Islam. So the House of David is really the monarchy that envisioned and enabled the unfolding of those monotheistic traditions, and they happened in sequence.' He added, 'This archeological fragment is a perfect example of the intersection of where archeology and biblical history meet.' The artifact is displayed as part of an exhibition of standout items from the museum’s collection of more than 30,000 works, reflecting 'an ever-evolving understanding of the relationship between art and global Jewish culture across time,' according to the museum’s website. The museum is currently renovating its third- and fourth-floor galleries, which are scheduled to open in next fall. Across from the stele is a video installation of poppies created this year by Israeli artist Michal Rovner, which explores the coexistence of beauty and violence in nature. 'Culture is an antidote to the polarization and politicization of the times we’re living in,' Snyder said. 'Culture is an opportunity to engage in ways that get into a brighter time ahead.'

Hamas signals significant softening on hostage deal	During this period, up to 30 hostages would be freed, including American citizens, women, elderly individuals, and those with medical conditions. By Jewish Breaking News After 14 months of war and devastating losses to its leadership ranks, Hamas may be finally ready for a ceasefire agreement that would see some of the hostages they brutally took on October 7 return to Israel. The Wall Street Journal reports that Hamas has made two unprecedented concessions that could finally break the diplomatic deadlock. Specifically, the Iranian-backed terrorist group has agreed to Israeli forces remaining in the Philadelphi corridor and the Netzarim corridor, which cuts through the enclave. Hamas has also conceded that it would relinquish any operational presence or control over the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza. Developed through Egyptian mediation with strong U.S. backing, the proposal on the table outlines a 60-day cessation of hostilities. During this period, up to 30 hostages would be freed, including American citizens, women, elderly individuals, and those with medical conditions. In return, Israel would be required to release an unspecified number of dangerous Arab prisoners and allow an increased flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Hamas’ newfound flexibility follows significant setbacks, including the October killing of leader Yahya Sinwar, who had demanded that any deal must include both a complete end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. According to sources familiar with the situation, Hamas is currently operating under a collective leadership until Sinwar’s successor is chosen. Additional pressure has come from President-elect Donald Trump, who recently warned on Truth Social that there would be ‘hell to pay’ in the Middle East if the hostages aren’t released before he assumes office in January. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has expressed optimism about the prospects for an agreement. ‘For months, we believe Hamas was waiting for lots of other actors and forces to come to their rescue,’ he said. ‘After the Israel-Lebanon cease-fire, we had a different character to the negotiation, and we believe that it puts us in a position to be able to close this negotiation.’ Sullivan is now headed to Qatar and Egypt to further advance the negotiations. While Netanyahu’s office has declined to comment directly on the negotiations, the Prime Minister has acknowledged that there were ‘certain developments’ in the cease-fire talks, though he cautioned it was premature to determine if a deal was within reach. Of the 100 hostages still in Gaza, at least 30 are believed to be deceased according to Israeli assessments. The majority of those remaining are Israeli citizens, though some hold dual nationality.'

While Netanyahu’s office has declined to comment directly on the negotiations, the Prime Minister has acknowledged that there were ‘certain developments’ in the cease-fire talks, though he cautioned it was premature to determine if a deal was within reach. Of the 100 hostages still in Gaza, at least 30 are believed to be deceased according to Israeli assessments. The majority of those remaining are Israeli citizens, though some hold dual nationality.'

Trump says Middle East peace ‘can take different forms’ than a Pa...	It can't go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News President-elect said that peace in the Middle East 'can take different forms' than a Palestinian state, which US administrations often tout as the only solution for solving the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. 'I support a plan of peace, and it can take different forms,' Trump tells Time magazine. 'I support whatever solution we can do to get peace. There are other ideas other than two-state, but I support whatever is necessary to get not just peace, [but] a lasting peace. It can't go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives,' he says. Trump continued, 'There are numerous ways you can do it. You can do two states, but there are numerous ways it can be done… I'd like to see everybody be happy. Everybody go about their lives, and people stop from dying. That includes on many different fronts,' the president-elect continued. This is at odds with Trump's statement during his previous presidency when he seemed to be open to a two-state solution. Trump said, 'I like the two-state solution… That's what I think works best.' However, Trump declared the next day, 'If the Israelis and Palestinians want one state, that's okay with me… If they want two states, that's okay with me.' In 2020, Trump offered the Palestinians a two-state deal that would have given them 70% of Judea and Samaria except for the areas that contain Israeli settlements. Although Trump's Mideast and Arab Affairs adviser, Massad Boulos, emphasized the previous Trump two-state plan as a starting point, both Trump and the Israeli public seem to be less inclined to support a Palestinian State after Hamas's massacre on October 7. 'What I want is a deal where there's going to be peace and where the killing stops,' Trump responds. When asked whether he supported the annexation of parts of Judea and Samaria, Trump avoided the question but added that he had prevented the move during his first administration. 'I want a long-lasting peace. I'm not saying that's a very likely scenario, but I want a long-lasting peace, a peace where we don't have an October 7 in another three years,' he says. 'There are numerous ways you can do it. You can do it in two states, but there are numerous ways it can be done… I'd like to see everybody be happy. Everybody go about their lives, and people stop from dying. That includes on many different fronts,' the president-elect continues.'

Israeli Air Force declares total air superiority over Syria	The near-total elimination of Syrian air defenses has enabled the IAF to operate freely over Syrian airspace, including directly above Damascus. By Jewish Breaking News After years of navigating Syria’s dense air defense network during its efforts to counter Iranian weapons shipments to Hezbollah, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) has announced it has achieved complete dominance in the region’s skies. In a recent large-scale operation, the IAF targeted advanced weaponry and military infrastructure across Syria, dismantling the Assad regime’s air defense systems and crippling its military capabilities. According to the Israeli military, the operation destroyed 86% of Syria’s air defense systems, including 107 air defense components and 47 radar installations. Notably, this included 80% of the Russian-made SA-22 (Pantsir-S1) and 90% of the SA-17 (Buk) systems, which had previously posed significant challenges during Israel’s Mabam (campaign between campaigns) strategy aimed at curtailing Iranian influence in Syria since 2013. The near-total elimination of Syrian air defenses has enabled the IAF to operate freely over Syrian airspace, including directly above Damascus. Surveillance drones and bombing raids can now be conducted without significant resistance, according to Israeli defense officials. This newfound air superiority coincides with the collapse of the Iran-backed Assad regime, a development that prompted Israel’s intensified strikes earlier this week. During the campaign, the IAF targeted airbases, weapons depots, missile production facilities, chemical weapons sites, and other strategic locations, deploying 1,800 munitions in total. The strikes also destroyed 27 fighter jets, 24 helicopters, and hundreds of advanced missiles.

Hollywood legend Richard Gere meets families of hostages held in ...	The families expressed both the heartbreak of their prolonged separation and their hope for international intervention. By Jewish Breaking News Richard Gere, the acclaimed Hollywood actor and long-time human rights advocate, has lent his voice and support to a humanitarian crisis that has left families in anguish. In an emotional meeting, Gere sat with the families of Naama Levi, Keith Siegel, and Karina Aviev, who have been held hostage in Gaza for over 433 days. During the meeting, he listened intently to their stories, offering empathy and solidarity while pledging to help amplify their plight on a global stage. The families expressed both the heartbreak of their prolonged separation and their hope for international intervention. By meeting with them, Gere aims to shine a spotlight on their ordeal, urging the world not to forget the hostages or the human cost of ongoing regional conflicts. This act of solidarity aligns with Gere’s history of advocating for human rights and peaceful resolutions to global crises. Known for his work with Tibetan refugees and his support for various humanitarian causes, his involvement in this issue adds a high-profile voice to the call for justice, humanitarian action, and the safe return of those held captive. The meeting comes amid renewed calls for diplomatic efforts and negotiations to secure the release of hostages in Gaza, underscoring the urgency of addressing the human suffering caused by the protracted conflict in the region.

Ski resort’s CEO dreams of expanding Hermon site	The site has been declared a closed military zone until the end of the month, and it’s thought that the order will be extended for another month. By Idan Avni, JNS We climb toward Mount Hermon’s peak up to the IDF outpost, reaching the northernmost point of Israel’s border. Until two days ago, this marked the international boundary line. No Israeli foot had crossed it, at least not officially. Now, the path extending into the buffer zone has been cleared. Soldiers from Shaldag, an Israeli Air Force special ops unit, ascended the mountain peak on foot and in jeeps. The 'conquest' of Mount Hermon concluded without a single shot being fired. Shaldag commandos advanced several additional miles from here. There’s no border fence here, only barrels and scattered patches of snow mark the buffer zone with Syria. The Syrian Army abandoned its outpost here years ago. The location that represents the 'eyes of the state' for Israel apparently held no significance for the Syrians. Only U.N. observers and smugglers making their way between Syria and Lebanon remain at the peak. The Shaldag force that climbed to the summit encountered no Syrian soldiers. They found only a lone Lebanese smuggler making his way with unladen donkeys. He wasn’t particularly concerned about being caught. His details were recorded, and he continued on his way. Apart from him, there is a U.N. outpost in the area, which the soldiers didn’t approach. Raphael Naveh, CEO of the Hermon ski site, had the privilege of climbing the Syrian peak with senior officers, or as he calls it: 'The New Hermon.' Israel’s only skiing site closed in October 2023; a few employees at the facility are working to prepare it for the upcoming season. Shaldag commandos on Mount Hermon. Credit: IDF Spokesperson’s Unit. The ski season won’t open for a while as the cable car cables were damaged, and experts need to come from abroad to repair them. The site has been declared a closed military zone until the end of the month, and it’s thought that the order will be extended for another month. Only afterward will the site open to visitors. 'We’re making repairs and hoping to get the site ready,' says Naveh. 'Many rockets fell here. Some hit equipment, the cable was torn. All the windows in the site offices were hit by shrapnel. If we hadn’t taken immediate action, the entire cable would have fallen, and it would have been very difficult to repair,' he related. Alpinist Unit’s disappointment From the peak, a view of the Hula Valley in Israel spread before us, with Lebanon’s Shouf Mountains on the other side. On a clear day, you can see Damascus, 43.5 miles away. Israel holds 7% of Mount Hermon, with the ski site occupying just 1% of the area. The IDF’s Alpinist Unit is a reservist force specializing in combat in snow and low temperatures. Near the ski site, Alpine unit soldiers are working with snow plows and snow cats as part of their winter preparations, although winter hasn’t really arrived here yet. According to the forecast, snow might fall here in a week. The Alpinists were noticeably disappointed that the Hermon 'capture' was given to Shaldag. It’s understandable. Those responsible for operational activities in the snow for the past 50 years were left out of the operational picture. The Alpinist soldiers know that when snow falls, conditions on the mountain will change. Untrained forces won’t survive here for one day. 'We know how to reach every spot on the mountain,' says Naveh, 'movement will only be possible in snow cats. They’ll also need to prepare for stays at the mountain peak.' The Alpinist Unit is small and highly skilled. Now that the Hermon area has more than doubled, additional soldiers need to be trained. According to IDF assessments, Syrian rebels won’t approach here in winter. The harsh conditions won’t allow infiltration from here, at least not without the help of smugglers, who are the only ones who know how to navigate and operate in high mountain conditions.

Below zero Night temperatures here drop below freezing, and the mountain winds create harsh conditions even without snow. The winter sun is warm but this changes after dark. The IDF will need to prepare for stays with special equipment. Everyone understands that when snow falls, the Alpinist Unit will take command. Naveh dreams about expanding the ski site. Building in Syrian territory is a pipe dream, but expanding the ski runs into the enlarged military area—that’s a dream that could come true. 'Once, I had a plan to put slopes on the border. To prepare for a peace ski site, where more sites would be established and the slopes would connect like in Europe,' he says with a smile. Originally published by Israel Hayom.

Inside Assad’s deserted palace: Anxiety pills and shattered power	Designed by a Japanese architect and completed in 1990 during Hafez Assad’s rule, the palace remains a relic of authoritarian architecture. By JNS Rebel fighters and civilians roamed the grounds of deposed Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s presidential palace on Tuesday, stepping over shredded posters of the ousted leader who fled to Russia days earlier, reported The Wall Street Journal. Inside Assad’s abandoned office, books, papers and personal items lay scattered. Among them were a history of the Russian military, a map of northeastern Syria, a biography of Assad and strips of benzodiazepine antianxiety pills. On a yellowed window, graffiti read, 'God damn your soul, Hafez,' a reference to Assad’s father, Hafez Assad, who ruled Syria for three decades before passing power to his son. The palace, perched on a hill near Damascus, offered a stark view of the final days of a dictator whose brutal tactics—including torture, bombings, and chemical attacks—defined his efforts to crush a rebellion that erupted during the Arab Spring in 2011. Demonstrators filled Umayyad Square in central Damascus, celebrating with rebel fighters brandishing rifles and waving the green, white and black flag of the Syrian revolution, the Journal reported. After years of civil war, Assad’s regime collapsed in less than two weeks as allies Russia and Iran failed to halt the rebels’ swift advance. Rebels aligned with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a Sunni Islamist group previously linked to the al-Qaeda terrorist group, took control of several cities before entering Damascus on Sunday with little resistance. On Tuesday, a rebel soldier, Mustafa Hassan, walked through the palace’s entry hall with comrades. 'The nightmare is over,' said Hassan, a former history teacher from Raqqa who joined the 2011 protests and later took up arms. Imprisoned by ISIS during its occupation of Raqqa, he now envisions rebuilding Syria. 'We’re done with one battle, and we’re beginning another: a battle of building and developing relations with other countries,' he told the Journal. Designed by a Japanese architect and completed in 1990 during Hafez Assad’s rule, the palace remains a relic of authoritarian architecture. Vast marble floors, cuboid halls and underground bunkers showcase its dual purpose as a fortress and a symbol of power. In an underground Cabinet room beneath the palace, brass plates marked the seats of high-ranking officials. Assad’s seat was labeled 'The Commander in Chief.' Adjacent to this meeting room were underground living quarters with a bedroom and accommodations for staff. Aston Martins and a Lamborghini On Sunday, HTS fighters secured the palace after euphoric civilians stormed it, looting furniture and artwork. Videos posted online showed people discovering a garage filled with luxury sports cars, including Aston Martins and a Lamborghini. HTS has sought to maintain order during the transition, preserving government institutions and keeping some regime police in place, the Journal reported. This effort underscores the group’s attempts to project stability and legitimacy. The fall of Assad’s regime is a significant blow to Russia and Iran, his key allies. Russia’s military intervention in 2015 had previously turned the tide in Assad’s favor, while Iran used Syria as a conduit to support militias including Hezbollah. Now, with Russia preoccupied by its invasion of Ukraine and Iran reeling from Israeli military strikes, the rebel victory shifts the geopolitical landscape. Israel has already acted, moving troops into a buffer zone near the Golan Heights and conducting airstrikes on Syrian military assets. Meanwhile, Turkey has escalated operations against Kurdish groups it views as terrorists, complicating U.S. relations in the region. Abroad, a debate is emerging over how to handle HTS, which remains a U.S.- and U.N.-designated terrorist organization. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Julani has claimed to renounce extremism and proposed a vision for protecting minorities under the group’s rule. However, the Biden administration has refrained from engaging with HTS, while some Western diplomats suggest reassessing its designation. In Damascus, celebratory gunfire mixed with distant explosions as signs of the regime’s downfall appeared across the city. Military vehicles lay destroyed along the highway between Damascus and Beirut. A bandoned troop carriers and discarded uniforms on the streets symbolized the regime’s rapid disintegration. Across Syria, residents tore down statues of Hafez Assad and replaced the regime’s red, black, and white flag with the rebel banner. Youssef al-Masri, a 54-year-o ld Islamic scholar, joined the celebrations in Umayyad Square. 'There are no words in Arabic or in any language to express the joy that is in our hearts after the end of 45 years of repression,' he told The Wall Street Journal. 'Today, we breathe.'

US Catholic group aims to get AJC Jew-hatred guide into ‘hands of...	Bishop Joseph Bambera, of the Scranton, Pa., diocese, and chairman of the committee on ecumenical and interreligious affairs of the Conference of Catholic Bishops, told JNS that the Catholic edition of the glossary will help fight Jew-hatred in parishes across the country. By Vita Fellig, JNS Some five years ago, the American Jewish Committee began publishing a 'Translate Hate' glossary of antisemitic terms, themes and online memes. The initial list of 25 entries has grown to 59 this year, according to the AJC, which is now partnering with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on an edition with Catholic commentary. Rabbi Noam Marans, director of interreligious affairs at AJC, told JNS that this is the first time that the group has had 'a partner beyond the Jewish community that is using the template of ‘Translate Hate,’ which is a very successful template that can be used within their constituency that has a Catholic flavor.' 'The genius of the ‘Translate Hate’ project is that it has infinite applications in languages, in different faiths and it’s a model that can really make an educational and practical difference in combating antisemitism,' Marans told JNS. The AJC and USCCB held a panel discussion on Wednesday to mark the release of the Catholic edition of the glossary. The glossary, for example, defines 'deicide' as the 'killing of a god,' and says that the term is antisemitic when it refers to 'the charge that Jews bear eternal responsibility for the death of Jesus Christ,' which it calls a 'misguided interpretation' of Christian scripture. The new Catholic commentary on the glossary notes that 'this trope is a classic anti-Jewish charge leveled against the Jewish people for nearly 17 centuries.' 'They have been labeled as ‘Christ-killers’ and suffered persecution under that name. The allegation stems from an early Christian misreading of the Gospels to blame all Jews for the death of Jesus,' the new commentary states in part. 'The dangers of such a distorted interpretation are particularly heightened in the Lenten and Paschal seasons as the faithful contemplate the mystery of Christ’s death and resurrection.' Bishop Joseph Bambera, of the Scranton, Pa., diocese, and chairman of the committee on ecumenical and interreligious affairs of the Conference of Catholic Bishops, told JNS that the Catholic edition of the glossary will help fight Jew-hatred in parishes across the country. 'We looked at entries that the church has teaching around, this mainly included entries that have roots in traditional Christian anti-Judaism, such as ‘deicide’ or ‘blood libel,’ or that relate to the church’s relationship to the Jewish people, such as ‘philosemitism,’' he told JNS. The American Jewish Committee held an event with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on Dec. 11, 2024. Photo by Vita Fellig. 'We fully endorse the AJC’s position that combating antisemitism begins with understanding it, and it is our hope that this resource be used particularly at the grassroots level to spread that awareness,' he added. 'By adding Catholic teaching, we signal that learning about these tropes is not only ancillary but part of being a better Catholic.' The USCCB plans to get 'the document in the hands of every bishop in the United States, as well as ecumenical and interreligious officers in every diocese,' he said. ‘Unimaginable to my grandparents’ The Jewish-Catholic collaboration is the product of decades of communal trust-building between the church and Jewish communities, which dates back to the church’s 1965 declaration of Nostra Aetate ('In our time') that publicly denounced Christian Jew-hatred, transforming the church’s relationship with Jews, according to Marans. 'It’s easy to lose perspective on the magnitude of an event like this, which was surely unimaginable to my grandparents in Bialystok, Poland,' Marans told attendees at the event. 'We have to understand that this has been a complete transformation in the relationship that has benefited both the Catholic Church, by lifting the burden of a history of enmity that was based upon theological perceptions that were not good, and for the Jewish people, as Christian teaching was life-threatening for our community for centuries,' he added at the event. The collaboration, he said, is a 'shehechiyanu moment,' or a time to make the Jewish blessing on new beginnings. Marans also allowed that tension remains between Jews and Catholics, particularly given that the pope has called for investigating the Jewish state for alleged genocide. 'An accusation of genocide against the Jewish people lands in a particularly nefarious way,' Marans said. Bambera told JNS that the Jewish community’s ability to express its frustration with the Vatican represents progress. The American Jewish Committee held an event with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on Dec. 11, 2024. Photo by Vita Fellig. 'The friendship that has grown in the nearly 60 years since the promulgation of Nostra Aetate allows for difficult times to bring us closer and not tear us apart,' he said. 'It shows great trust that our Jewish brothers and sisters have been able to express their concerns, and we as a church, and I personally, are very grateful for that.' Bambera believes that the pope has not intended to harm the Jewish community. 'What I hear from Pope Francis is his deep concern for each and every life, born out of the belief in the value of the human person and the obligation to respect human life,' the bishop said, noting the biblical reference in Genesis to people being created in the divine image. 'In 2013, in an address to the International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultation, Pope Francis stated, ‘A true Christian cannot be an antisemite,’' the bishop said. 'I believe he has not gone back on those words or the teachings of our church that enabled him to proclaim them.' 'We are committed to this relationship and the principles expressed in Nostra Aetate, to walk with our Jewish brothers and sisters, and to combat any and all forms of antisemitism,' he added.

An Israeli cafe chain launched by and for Oct. 7 survivors is exp...	The cafe has become a gathering place for those directly impacted by the events of Oct. 7 — survivors of the Nova music festival, bereaved parents and others — while also offering a space for those not directly affected to engage with their stories and find meaning. By Deborah Danan, JTA A woman with a gaunt face and ripped pajama pants ambles into Cafe Otef, nestled in a up-and-coming yet still gritty corner of Tel Aviv’s Florentin neighborhood. She gestures to the water dispenser, and Ziv Hai, a worker at the cafe, obliges with a glass while owner Reut Karp offers her a cigarette. 'We don’t have them in our region,' Hai said about apparently unhoused people. 'Learning how to navigate that has also been part of the journey.' Hai was far from home because the cafe is no ordinary establishment. Founded by Tamir Barelko, a serial entrepreneur in the culinary world, it is the second in the Cafe Otef chain — 'Otef' referring to the 'envelope' region of Israel bordering Gaza that Hamas terrorists invaded on Oct. 7, 2023. The first branch opened as a pop-up in Tel Aviv’s glitzy Sarona complex, staffed by residents of Netiv Haasara, one of the communities targeted in the massacre. This branch, named Cafe Otef-Re’im, honors the kibbutz of the same name, where 80 terrorists invaded, killing seven residents and kidnapping four. The kibbutz was also next to where the Nova music festival massacre took place. Staffed entirely by displaced residents from the battered communities in the south, the cafe offers a wide range of goods from that region: cheeses from Be’eri, honey from Kibbutz Erez, jams, spreads, granola and specialty cakes, alongside branded items such T-shirts, water bottles, and aprons — all sourced from small producers affected by the massacre. But the piece de resistance is the chocolate, crafted from recipes by Dvir Karp, the owner’s late ex-husband, who was murdered on Oct. 7 in front of their children, then ages 10 and 8. Reut Karp said that during the pandemic, 'when we all thought we were going to die,' she had urged her ex-husband to write down his chocolate recipes. Despite his initial resistance — insisting he had them all in his head — he eventually complied. After his murder, Karp felt a profound responsibility to preserve his legacy. She believes Dvir would have been proud of her posthumous rebranding of his chocolates, including a new logo inspired by the luxury brand Cartier, though she joked he would 'probably say I went overboard.' Most of Re’im’s residents were evacuated to nearby apartment buildings in Florentin, while Hai, who is from a different kibbutz close to Egypt, was initially relocated with his family to Ofakim, a small city near Beersheba. In April, he moved to Tel Aviv, where he said he experienced an intense culture shock. 'At first, I was like, what the hell am I doing here, and I just wanted to move back,' he said. Over time, however, he adjusted to city life, finding a sense of belonging through his work at the cafe, which opened in the summer. 'I feel like I left a piece of myself behind in Sufa, and here in Tel Aviv, I’m trying to rebuild myself anew. The cafe gives me a place where I can feel comfortable,' he said. 'I can tell a dark joke, and everyone here — because they’re also from the south — gets it.' Karp, who co-owns another cafe featuring Dvir’s chocolates in Israel’s south, was approached by Barelko to manage the Re’im branch. She declined, citing her responsibilities to her three children who are still coping with the trauma of the attack (Karp herself was away for the weekend of Oct. 7). Determined to involve her, Barelko appointed managers to handle daily operations, allowing Karp to serve as the owner and hostess. The role proved a perfect fit for Karp, who expressed gratitude for having a reason to get up each day. 'So many times over the past six months, I’ve said, thank God I have this place that forces me out of bed. And all the workers say the same thing,' she shared, highlighting one employee who had lost his entire family in the attack. The cafe has become a gathering place for those directly impacted by the events of Oct. 7 — survivors of the Nova music festival, bereaved parents and others — while also offering a space for those not directly affected to engage with their stories and find meaning. 'They want to feel a sense of connection and to know it’s not just a gimmick,' Karp said. 'People always say Tel Avivians are living in a bubble — sitting in coffee shops while soldiers are fighting and hostages are trapped in Hamas tunnels,' she added. 'But here, people let themselves enjoy coffee without the guilt.' The cafe’s location in the center of the country has also made it a natural meeting point for evacuees from both Israel’s north and south who have been relocated to the city. Karp noted the unique camaraderie that has formed between the two groups, describing it as a shared understanding of what it means to be displaced within their own country. As if on cue, an older woman from Kibbutz Manara in the north approached and chatted with Karp about her recent visit to her kibbutz — the first since the ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah in late November. Their laughter seemed out of place given the context of the conversation, with the older woman remarking that it would take 'at least a decade' to rebuild the kibbutz. Over 70% of the homes in Manara have been damaged, with rocket fragments still scattered across the area, prompting some residents to compare it to Chernobyl. The two hug before the older woman walks away — a scene that plays out repeatedly throughout the afternoon. 'Some people recognize me from TV but hesitate to ask questions or offer a hug,' Karp said. 'But that contact is like a human charger for me.' Around 100 of Re’im’s 450 residents have returned home. Yet, according to Karp, many of their temporary neighbors in Tel Aviv feel conflicted about their departure. 'On the one hand, they’re happy for us to go back home, but on the other, they want us to stay because our presence here has put a face to Oct. 7,' she said. The red anemone, or kalanit – Israel’s national flower, ubiquitous in the region of Re’im — is equally ubiquitous at the cafe, embroidered on staff uniforms, printed on takeaway cups, and displayed on ceramic items for sale. But otherwise, there are few overt signs of the cafe’s deeper purpose. One less obvious sign comes in an innocuous poster on the wall, its tiny spiral text easy to miss. Created by Adi Drimer, an art teacher from Re’im, the artwork contains the haunting text messages sent in the kibbutz WhatsApp group on Oct. 7. Karp points out her own chilling plea from that day, begging other kibbutz members to rescue her children: 'Urgent! Urgent! Daria and Lavi are alone,' read her text. 'Dvir was murdered.' Karp said the decision to avoid making the cafe overtly about the massacre was deliberate, respecting those who prefer to keep their coffee and grief separate. 'We also don’t want to sink into the sadness of it all,' she said. 'This is a place for renewal, and when people see us moving forward, it inspires them.' Barelko has big plans for the chain. Two new branches are set to open in the coming weeks: one in Rehovot, called Cafe Otef–Sderot, for residents of the southern town, and a misnomered Cafe Otef–Kiryat Shmona, paying tribute to those evacuated from the northern town for 14 months. He also plans to introduce food trucks at various locations across the country and expand the initiative to include employment for soldiers disabled in the war, whose numbers are estimated in the thousands. 'In the end, we realized this is the best approach to rehabilitation. It builds both hope and resilience,' he said.

Biden commutes 1,500 sentences in one day, shattering record	The record-breaking act of clemency comes just two weeks after the president’s controversial pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, which he promised not to do numerous times. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of nearly 1,500 individuals and pardoned another 39, breaking the record for the largest grant of clemency in a single day, the White House announced on Thursday. The White House said those granted clemency 'have shown successful rehabilitation and a strong commitment to making their communities safer.' Most of the individuals who were issued commutations—which leaves a guilty verdict intact but lessens some or all punishments—had been placed in home confinement during COVID-19 under the CARES Act. T he 39 pardoned individuals were convicted of nonviolent crimes, including drug offenses. 'As the President has said, the United States is a nation of second chances,' the White House said in a statement. 'The President recognizes how the clemency power can advance equal justice under law and remedy harms caused by practices of the past.' Biden’s unprecedented move far surpasses former president Barack Obama’s 330 commutations, the second-largest single-day act of clemency, according to Politico. The record-breaking act of clemency comes just two weeks after the president’s controversial pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, which he promised not to do numerous times. Hunter was convicted of gun possession in June and income tax evasion in September. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle criticized the president for the sweeping pardon. In the wake of the first son's pardon, some Democrats and clemency advocacy groups pressured Biden to use his exoneration powers more broadly before leaving office, Politico reported. Biden indicated in his statement that his administration 'will take more steps in the weeks ahead' in the name of 'equal justice.' 'My Administration will continue reviewing clemency petitions to advance equal justice under the law, promote public safety, support rehabilitation and reentry, and provide meaningful second chances.' The president’s team is also weighing whether or not to give preemptive pardons to adversaries of President-elect Donald Trump, including Senator Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) and former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, according to Politico.

Trump considering strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities	The incoming administration is reportedly developing a 'maximum pressure 2.0' strategy to reinstate the aggressive sanctions on Iran that were implemented during Trump's first term. By World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly considering pre-emptive strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, the Wall Street Journal reports. The news comes as Israel is reportedly considering an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Trump said he wants to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon but is concerned about the possibility of a war developing that would require deployment of US troops. The incoming administration is reportedly developing a 'maximum pressure 2.0' strategy, aiming to reinstate the aggressive sanctions on Iran that were implemented during Trump's first term, after he withdrew from the Obama-era agreement designed to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. According to sources familiar with the plan, the strategy includes various approaches to using military pressure as a means to deter Tehran. Washington may deploy additional forces, ships, and warplanes to the region, while also enhancing Israel’s offensive capabilities by selling bunker-busting bombs. If these measures prove ineffective, however, the US could adopt a more aggressive approach, including the threat of direct military action, according to the sources. It is believed that reports Iran was attempting to assassinate Trump may have inspired his strong stance against the Islamic Republic.

US Security Adviser to Hamas: ‘No one is coming to rescue you’	Kirby also urged Hamas to agree to a hostage release deal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said that Hamas should regard the fall of Assad's regime as a warning. Kirby also urged Hamas to agree to a hostage release deal. In a press briefing, Kirby responded to a question about National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan's comments on a potential ceasefire agreement saying that the current circumstances make it a critical moment for Hamas. Kirby explained that Hamas is significantly weakened, with its military capabilities decimated, its leadership diminished, and no external support coming from Iran. Additionally, Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, is in a ceasefire with Israel, further isolating Hamas. Kirby emphasized that this moment, when Hamas is vulnerable, is the ideal opportunity to strike a deal, as pressure mounts on those supporting the organization. 'One thing I didn’t add was events in Syria, because now Assad is gone. And who was Assad’s main backer? Iran. Iran was not only unwilling but unable to come to Assad’s rescue. It’s just more proof — or should be more proof — to Hamas leaders that there is, as I said, no cavalry coming to the rescue,' he stated. The Hamas terror organization has agreed to soften its position regarding two key issues that have held up hostage negotiations for the past year, Arab mediators told The Wall Street Journal. According to a WSJ report on Wednesday, Hamas told hostage deal brokers that the group is willing to allow Israeli troops to remain in Gaza temporarily during a potential 60-day ceasefire, a significant shift in its demands for a complete IDF withdrawal and an end to the Gaza conflict. Under the proposed deal, Hamas would release up to 30 hostages, including U.S. citizens, women, elderly individuals, and captives with serious medical conditions. In exchange, Israel would free jailed Palestinian terrorists and facilitate increased humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip.

Israeli strikes in Syria may pave way for targeting Iran’s nuclea...	Sources in the Israeli Air Force said they were preparing for action against Iran's nuclear sites and were enlisting the aid of the US. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF said that military actions, including the elimination of 85% of Syrian anti-aircraft missiles, may provide an opportunity to target Iran's nuclear program. Sources in the Israeli Air Force said they were preparing for action against Iran's nuclear sites and were enlisting the aid of the US. The IDF announced that it has struck 320 targets and destroyed at least 80% of Syria's military capabilities to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorist groups. More than 350 Israeli fighter jets took part in Operation 'Bashan's Arrow' to neutralize military sites once controlled by the Assad regime, which fell to rebel fighters. Among the targets were advanced military systems such as tanks, fighter jets, helicopters, air defense systems, missile-equipped ships, rockets, arms manufacturing facilities, munitions storage sites, Scud missiles, cruise missiles, coastal defense missiles, drones, and various other weaponry. In addition, the IDF struck at a Scud missile manufacturing site in the Homs area. Secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin, located 19 miles southeast of Tehran, was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on October 26, according to a report from Axios. The facility housed advanced equipment used for testing explosives necessary to detonate nuclear devices, the report stated, citing three US officials, as well as one current and one former Israeli official. High-resolution satellite images obtained by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security showed that the site was completely destroyed in the attack. Israeli and US intelligence agencies first detected activity at the Taleghan 2 facility within the Parchin military complex in early 2024, a site that had remained largely inactive since 2003, when Iran froze its military nuclear program, Axios reported. According to one unnamed US official quoted in the report, 'The Iranians conducted scientific activity that could pave the way for the production of a nuclear weapon. It was a top-secret operation. Only a small segment of the Iranian government was aware of it, while most of the government remained in the dark.'

Trump named ‘Time’ magazine ‘Person of the Year’	The news magazine noted that while in some years the selection was difficult, this year it was unquestionably not. By JNS U.S. President-elect Donald J. Trump was named Time magazine’s Person of the Year on Thursday in recognition of his political comeback and a campaign in which he overcame a felony conviction and assassination attempts to return to the helm of American leadership. 'For marshaling a comeback of historic proportions, for driving a once-in-a-­generation political realignment, for reshaping the American presidency and altering America’s role in the world, Donald Trump is TIME’s 2024 ­’Person of the Year,'' the magazine wrote. The magazine, which has bestowed the annual award for the last 97 years (called ‘Man of the Year’ or ‘Woman of the Year’ until 1999), awarded Trump the title in 2016 after his first presidential victory, in keeping with a quarter-century tradition of honoring new presidents. The news magazine noted that while in some years the selection was difficult, this year it was unquestionably not. 'Since he began running for President in 2015, perhaps no single individual has played a larger role in changing the course of politics and history than Trump,' Time said. 'On the cusp of his second presidency, all of us—from his most fanatical supporters to his most fervent critics—are living in the Age of Trump. Trump is once again at the center of the world, and in as strong a position as he has ever been.' Donald Trump. Credit: 'TIME' magazine. The annual 'Person of the Year' award is given to a newsmaker who has 'done the most to influence the events of the year,' which in the past has included people ranging from Winston Churchill and Queen Elizabeth II to Vladimir Putin and Joseph Stalin.

IAF strikes Hamas terrorists planning to hijack aid trucks	On Wednesday, the World Central Kitchen (WCK) NGO dismissed 62 of its local staff members in the Gaza Strip—more than 10% of its workforce—after Israel said they had links to terrorist groups. By JNS The Israeli Air Force attacked two groups of Hamas gunmen in southern Gaza overnight Wednesday. The terrorists were planning to hijack trucks carrying humanitarian aid, the military said. The intelligence-based precision strikes were conducted at two meeting points where the Hamas members were operating along the humanitarian corridor. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the strikes were intended to ensure the safe delivery of aid to civilians in the Gaza Strip. 'All of the terrorists who were eliminated were members of Hamas and planned to violently hijack humanitarian aid trucks and transfer them to Hamas in support of continuing terrorist activity, preventing them from reaching Gazan civilians, as was done in previous cases,' the IDF said. The IDF emphasized that it does not target aid trucks and that the humanitarian corridor remains open and active. The army also stressed that measures are taken to prevent harm to civilians and that, alongside the Defense Ministry’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) unit, it will continue to act in accordance with international law to facilitate the transfer of humanitarian aid to the residents of the Gaza Strip. On Wednesday, the World Central Kitchen (WCK) NGO dismissed 62 of its local staff members in the Gaza Strip—more than 10% of its workforce—after Israel said they had links to terrorist groups. The dismissals came a week after the Israeli Air Force killed terrorist Ahed Azmi Qadi, who participated in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. Qadi was employed by WCK, but he was driving an unmarked vehicle at the time of the strike and was not on a designated aid route. Immediately following the airstrike, WCK denied knowing that any of the vehicle’s occupants were linked to the Oct. 7 attacks and announced a pause in its Gaza operations as a result of the incident. 'We are heartbroken to share that a vehicle carrying World Central Kitchen colleagues was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. At this time, we are working with incomplete information and are urgently seeking more details,' the Washington-based NGO wrote on X. 'Our hearts are with our colleagues and their families in this unimaginable moment,' the organization tweeted. Some 6,000 terrorists from Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah, as well as unaffiliated Palestinian civilians, infiltrated the Jewish state on Oct. 7, 2023, murdering some 1,200 people, wounding thousands and kidnapping 250. There are currently one hundred hostages being held in Gaza, including four who were abducted before Oct. 7.

Report: Hamas prepared to make key concessions for hostage deal	Gaza terror group reportedly tells Arab brokers that it is willing to accept two key Israeli demands for hostage deal and ceasefire - including allowing Israeli troops to remain in Gaza during the truce. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization has agreed to soften its position regarding two key issues that have held up hostage negotiations for the past year, Arab mediators told The Wall Street Journal. According to a report Wednesday, Hamas has told hostage deal brokers that the group is willing to allow Israeli troops to remain in Gaza temporarily during a potential 60-day ceasefire, a significant shift in its demands for a complete IDF withdrawal and an end to the Gaza conflict. Under the proposed deal, Hamas would release up to 30 hostages, including U.S. citizens, women, elderly individuals, and captives with serious medical conditions. In exchange, Israel would free jailed Palestinian terrorists and facilitate increased humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip. Mediators also revealed that Hamas recently provided a list of hostages, including five who are deceased, marking the first such submission since the November ceasefire and hostage release. Hamas is also reportedly showing flexibility regarding Israeli troop withdrawal from key areas such as the Philadelphi Corridor on the Egyptian border and the Netzarim Corridor running across the neck of the Gaza Strip. Israel has vowed to retain control of the two strategic areas over the long term, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling them critical areas for Israeli security. Negotiations are ongoing, with Israel pushing for a larger initial release of hostages and Hamas working to identify the conditions and whereabouts of remaining captives. The situation remains fluid, as both sides explore pathways to a temporary reprieve in the conflict. Mossad chief David Barnea, who is leading Israel's negotiating team, met with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani on Wednesday, after Qatar resumed its role as a broker between Israel and Hamas. On Thursday, U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with Netanyahu in Jerusalem to discuss the Biden administration's final push for a hostage deal before inauguration day next month, as well as Israel's security zone on the Syrian border.

Syrian dissident leaders call for ‘Abrahamic peace’ with Israel	Dissident faction called the 'Syrian Government in Exile' call for 'mutual understanding' and peace with Israel in virtual meeting with an Israeli lawmaker. By World Israel News Staff A group of Syrian dissidents called for 'Abrahamic peace' between Syria following the ousting of President Bashar Assad and Israel, during a virtual meeting with an Israeli lawmaker. In a virtual forum held by the Middle East Center, a group of Syrian dissidents calling themselves the 'Syrian Government in Exile' met with Religious Zionist Party MK Ohad Tal during a panel discussion hosted by Israeli political strategist and marijuana legalization advocate Tom Wegner, who founded the Middle East Center. One of the participants, Jamal Sabbagh, head of the so-called Syrian Government in Exile, lauded Israeli policy and efforts to expand 'Abrahamic peace' in the Middle East, an apparent reference to the Abraham Accords. Dr. Ziad Karim, communication director of the SGE endorsed the Abraham Accords, and called for the deepening of ties between Middle East nations - including Israel. 'We are not living on an isolated island but in a shared fate,' Karim said, according to The Jerusalem Post, warning against allowing the Middle East to become mired in the 'swamp of extremism.' 'The Abrahamic peace is a roadmap to mutual understanding and a future where wisdom embraces humanity above all else.' SGE foreign affairs chief Amal Sharkasi claimed Syria had, prior to the takeover of Syria by Bashar Assad's father, Hafez, in 1971, promoted interfaith coexistence, citing the term of a Christian prime minister, Fares al-Khouri, and Jewish doctors in Aleppo. During the virtual meeting, the SGE members claimed the group is 'more Hebrew than the Children of Israel,' and called for tolerance and mutual respect. MK Tal, a member of the Knesset's powerful Foreign Affairs and Security Committee, emphasized opportunities for collaboration between Israel and Arab states against both Iran and radical Sunni Islamist elements. Several Iraqi delegates also took part in the meeting, including peace activist Abou Musa al-Iraqi, who operates social media accounts under the handle 'Virtual Embassy of Iraq to Israel.'

Honor to renew commitment to the Jewish people,' says President Santiago Peña during visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem, hours before the opening ceremony for Paraguay's new embassy in Jerusalem. By World Israel News Staff Paraguayan President Santiago Peña visited the Western Wall Plaza in the Old City of Jerusalem Thursday, just hours before he was scheduled to take part in a ceremony marking the unveiling of Paraguay's new embassy in Jerusalem. As part of his solidarity visit to Israel, Peña arrived at the Western Wall this Thursday morning with a delegation of Paraguayan leaders, including the president of Parliament, government ministers, members of parliament, and his family. 'I am here today to thank God because, three years ago, I came here to pray that I would be granted the position of president and the opportunity to serve my country,' Peña said. 'It is an honor for me to say thank you here and to renew my commitment to do good for Paraguay, for Israel, and for the Jewish people.' The delegation was welcomed by Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, Rabbi of the Western Wall and Holy Sites, and Mordechai (Suli) Eliav, Director of the Western Wall Heritage Foundation. They expressed gratitude for Paraguay’s strong support for Israel and explained the site’s historical and spiritual significance for the Jewish people throughout the generations. During the visit, the president offered a silent prayer at the Wall, placed a personal note between its stones, and signed the guest book. He concluded his visit with a tour of the Western Wall Tunnels. Later on Thursday, Peña will oversee the opening of Paraguay's new embassy in Jerusalem, located in the Har Hotzvim tech park. Paraguay is poised to become the sixth country to relocate its embassy to Israel's capital city, joining the United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Kosovo, and Papa New Guinea. In 2018, Paraguay also relocated its embassy to Jerusalem, but later reverted its mission headquarters in Israel back to Tel Aviv.

Illegal Arab construction in Judea, Samaria plummets amid stricte...	Illegal Palestinian construction 'deterred' by sharp increase in enforcement actions against unauthorized buildings in Judea and Samaria, report finds. By World Israel News Staff The number of new illegal Palestinian Arab building starts in Judea and Samaria is down sharply this year, according to a new report, following a period of increased enforcement efforts against unauthorized construction. On Wednesday, the watchdog group Regavim released a report which found a significant decline in the number of new illegal construction starts in Judea and Samaria, and the number of new illegal buildings in the area. For the report, Regavim's Research Division analyzed aerial surveys of Judea and Samaria, comparing May 2024 to June 2023 images. The study found that there was a significant decrease in the number of new illegal structures completed in 2024, with a monthly average of 260 buildings completed during the last survey period, down from 608 new completed buildings per month in 2023 and 547 in 2022, marking a drastic reduction compared to the previous five years. Under the Bennett-Lapid government, with Benny Gantz as Defense Minister, illegal construction in the Arab sector in Judea and Samaria reached an all-time high, with an average of 642 new buildings completed per month in mid-2022, which represents 234% more in comparison to the rate in this new study’s time-period. In 2023, the first year of the current government’s administration in which preservation of state land was prioritized, the upward trend established under the previous government continued, with an average of 608 structures per month. However, the latest measurements indicate a reversal of this trend in the first half of 2024. The authors of the report said the decline was likely not to due to the ongoing war with Hamas, and suggested instead that increased enforcement activity against illegal Arab construction was influencing the decline. In the first 10 months of 2024, the report noted, the Civil Administration demolished 602 illegal Arab-built structures in Area C, compared to only 306 in all of 2023. The Civil Administration is also more likely now to demolish larger, permanent buildings, with a number of multi-story villas dismantled this year near the Tekoa-Jerusalem road in Eastern Gush Etzion, along with another three villas in northern Samaria, and a large building opposite Efrat. 'These high-profile demolitions served as a deterrent, signaling to the Palestinian Authority and its international supporters that Israel now views illegal construction as a strategic security threat,' said Naomi Kahn, Director of Regavim's International Division. 'This contrasts with previous years, when demolitions focused on warehouses, fences, and minor structures. This change in policy, long advocated by Regavim, has been increasingly supported by Israeli legislators since the October 7th attack, which was facilitated by similar dual-use illegal structures near the Gaza border.' Although this year's figures show a decrease in the pace of land takeovers, the long-term trend continues to rise. The Palestinian Authority has now constructed 97,581 illegal structures in Area C of Judea and Samaria, an area fully governed by Israeli civil and security forces. Aerial imagery clearly shows that the Palestinian Authority has chosen to prioritize building, agricultural, and infrastructure projects in Area C instead of developing Areas A and B, aligning with the 2009 Fayyad Plan's aim to establish a Palestinian state across all of Judea and Samaria. Regavim has noted that aerial images show minimal new construction in PA-controlled areas, with intensive building near major roads in Area C posing security threats by isolating Israeli settlements and linking PA villages to strategic highways. Construction in the seam-line buffer zone continues unabated, while illegal Israeli structures in Area C have decreased by 50% over the past year, totaling 5,654, with 85% of them within recognized Israeli community boundaries. 'This is a refreshing shift in the battle for land', says Meir Deutsch, Regavim Director. 'While the State of Palestine is being established de facto through construction and infrastructure, the Israeli government is finally responding to voter mandates by addressing these developments. We hope to see this trend continue and even intensify.'

Syrian butcher settles into luxury Moscow life	Financial records show the Assad family owns over 20 luxury properties across Moscow valued at over $30 million, including opulent apartments in the city’s elite business district where units fetch upwards of 10 million euros. By Jewish Breaking News Deposed dictator Bashar al-Assad is likely settling into one of his family’s many multimillion-dollar Moscow penthouses, courtesy of his longtime patron Vladimir Putin. Russian officials confirmed Tuesday that Assad has arrived in Moscow after fleeing Damascus on Sunday, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov telling NBC News that Russia transported the former Syrian leader in the 'most secure way possible.' 'He is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,' said Ryabkov. 'I have no idea what is going on with him right now. It would be very wrong for me to elaborate on what happened and how it was resolved.' As for Assad, he won’t be roughing it in exile. Financial records show the family owns more than 20 luxury properties across Moscow valued at over $30 million, including opulent apartments in the city’s elite business district where units fetch upwards of 10 million euros. These high-rise sanctuaries feature marble floors, panoramic views, and all the amenities befitting a dictator accustomed to robbing the masses. Investigations reveal the Assads amassed much of their fortune by transforming Syria into a narco-state through industrial production of Captagon, an addictive amphetamine widely used across Middle Eastern party scenes. Assad’s ties to Moscow run deep. The dictator’s eldest son Hafez completed studies there, with his mother Asma attending his graduation. Asma, once glamorously profiled by Vogue as Syria’s 'Rose in the Desert' in 2011 before her husband’s regime engaged in mass murder and torture, is reportedly battling leukemia. She and the couple’s three children are believed to have joined Assad in Moscow. While rebels post videos touring Assad’s abandoned garage full of luxury vehicles back in Damascus, international calls mount for him to face justice for war crimes including chemical weapons attacks. But for Putin, who treats his ICC warrant like junk mail, it appears unlikely he would interrupt Assad’s comfortable retirement. 'Russia is not a party to the convention that established the International Criminal Court,' Ryabkov said. Assad joins an exclusive Moscow club of fallen autocrats under Putin’s protection. Former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych has lived there since the 2014 Maidan Revolution, while Kyrgyzstan’s Askar Akayev found refuge after being ousted in 2005.

House passes annual defense bill with hundreds of millions for Is...	The bill also bars Tricare—the military’s health-care program—from paying for any medical procedure that could cause sterilization as part of the treatment of gender dysphoria in children, including sex-change operations. By JNS The U.S. House of Representatives passed the $895 billion annual defense bill on Wednesday with hundreds of millions of dollars for Israel. Formally titled the 'Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025,' the legislation includes $500 million for U.S.-Israel missile-defense cooperation, $47.5 million for U.S.-Israel cooperation on emerging technologies and $80 million for the U.S.-Israeli anti-tunneling initiative. It also includes a provision that would bar the U.S. Department of Defense from citing casualty statistics from the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. 'In making assessments of casualties and fatalities during hostilities, the Department of Defense may not cite as authoritative in public communications, fatality figures that are derived by United States-designated terrorist organizations, governmental entities controlled by United States-designated terrorist organizations, or any sources that rely on figures provided by United States-designated terrorist organizations,' the act says. The U.S. State Department designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. The Pentagon faced scrutiny regarding the use of Hamas’s statistics after Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin cited them during congressional testimony in February. They have been repeated by other members of the Biden administration, including U.S. President Joe Biden. In June, an Associated Press investigation revealed that Hamas’s claims about the number of Palestinian casualties were contradicted by its own data, and the United Nations nearly halved its casualty estimates back in May of the number of women and children killed in the conflict after more closely scrutinizing Hamas’s claims. Non-Israel provisions of the 1,813-page defense bill include an overall 1% increase in U.S. defense spending over fiscal year 2024 and a 14.5% pay increase for junior enlisted troops. The bill also bars Tricare—the military’s health-care program—from paying for any medical procedure that could cause sterilization as part of the treatment of gender dysphoria in children, including sex-change operations. The defense spending package passed 281-140, with 81 Democrats supporting the bill and 16 Republicans opposing. The vote split the Democratic leadership, with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), Democratic Caucus chairman Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) and Democratic Caucus vice chair Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) voting 'yea' while Democratic Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), assistant Democratic leader Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) joined most Democrats in voting 'nay.' The 16 Republicans who voted against the bill included some of the House’s most conservative members, including former Freedom Caucus chairmen Reps. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and Bob Good (R-Va.). The bill will now proceed to the Senate.

Israel will retain control of Syrian buffer zone until new force ...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defends IDF seizure of demilitarized zone on Syrian side of the Golan Heights, says Israel's military must remain there to prevent jihadi infiltration until a new 'force' can secure the area. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday defended Israel's seizure of a demilitarized zone on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, saying the move was necessary to prevent new 'October 7th style attacks' on Israel. In a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office Thursday morning, Netanyahu warned that the fall of the Assad regime on Sunday left a 'vacuum' on Israel's northern border, one which could potentially be exploited by Islamist elements operating in Syria. 'The collapse of the Syrian regime created a vacuum on Israel’s border and in the buffer zone established by the 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement,' Netanyahu said. 'Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7th style attacks.' 'That is why Israeli forces entered the buffer zone and took control of strategic sites near Israel’s border.' Netanyahu emphasized that Israel's control of the demilitarized zone is temporary, and will end when a new force can secure the area, though the Israeli premier declined to specify who would be responsible for the new force, or when such a force could be assembled. 'This deployment is temporary until a force that is committed to the 1974 agreement can be established and security on our border can be guaranteed.' The Golan Heights demilitarized zone was established following the 1973 Yom Kippur War, during which Syrian forces overran much of the Golan during the initial invasion, before IDF troops retook the strategic plateau and drove into the interior of Syria towards Damascus. To disengage the entangled Israeli and Syrian forces, the U.S. negotiated the May 1974 Disengagement of Forces agreement, under which Israel ceded 200 square miles of the 700 square-mile Golan. Nearly half of the area handed over to Syria became a demilitarized zone, with a United Nations observer force to ensure compliance with the ceasefire. On Sunday, shortly after the collapse of the Assad regime, Israeli tanks and infantry units occupied the DMZ, establishing a new security zone.

IDF intercepts Houthi and Iraqi drone over southern Israel	On Monday, a blast in a residential high-rise building in Yavne, northeast of Ashdod, was confirmed to have been caused by a drone launched from Yemen. By World Israel News and JNS The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported multiple incidents involving drones launched toward Israel from various locations. On Thursday, the IDF intercepted a drone launched by Houthi terrorists from Yemen over the Red Sea. The drone, which was targeting Israel’s southernmost city of Eilat, did not cross into Israeli airspace, according to the military. Earlier that day, air-raid sirens were triggered in several cities near the Gaza Strip, including Ashkelon, Sderot, and Netivot, following reports of a suspected drone. However, the IDF later stated that the incident was under investigation and might have been a false alarm. In another development, the Israeli Air Force intercepted an attack drone launched 'from the east' into southern Israel. The term 'from the east' is commonly used to indicate an attack originating from Iraq. This drone did not trigger alarms per standard protocol, and no injuries were reported. These incidents follow a series of drone attacks targeting Israel in recent weeks. On Monday, a blast in a residential high-rise building in Yavne, northeast of Ashdod, was confirmed to have been caused by a drone launched from Yemen. On November 17, another drone intercepted over central Israel entered Israeli airspace from the east. The interception led to an impact near Moshav Kfar Hanagid, close to Yavne, where a fire, apparently caused by an interceptor fragment, was subsequently extinguished. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iranian-backed Shi’ite militias, has been conducting daily drone attacks on Israel since the Hamas-led massacre in southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Similarly, Iran-backed Houthi forces in Yemen have launched numerous drones and missiles targeting Israel over the past year, aligning with their support for the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza.

Tel Aviv defense-tech summit highlights innovation, AI	Innovation and the transformative role of artificial intelligence in defense was a recurring theme at the conference, spearheaded by the Israel Ministry of Defense Directorate of Defense, Research, and Development (DDR&D). By Sveta Listratov, TPS As Israeli airstrikes systematically dismantled Syrian military assets, leading figures in defense innovation, entrepreneurship, and academia gathered at Tel Aviv University some 200 km away to discuss the impact of technology on the battlefront. 'We all watched as Syria collapsed within days. The entire Iranian Axis was severely damaged as a direct result of Israel’s military operations. When Israeli pilots used American aircraft equipped with Israeli technology to hit Iran’s most advanced defense systems – it sent a powerful message to the world,' said Eyal Zamir, Director General of the Defense Ministry, speaking at the International Defense Tech Summit at Tel Aviv University on Tuesday. 'Artificial intelligence (AI) is not just another technological revolution; it will completely redefine warfare as we know it. A country that does not invest in AI today will fall far behind on tomorrow’s battlefield.' Zamir also called for expanding manufacturing independence in Israel’s defense industry to reduce reliance on foreign resources. Innovation and the transformative role of artificial intelligence in defense was a recurring theme at the conference, spearheaded by the Israel Ministry of Defense Directorate of Defense, Research, and Development (DDR&D). 'Innovation is not just our secret weapon but our source of strength,' said Avi Hason, CEO of Startup Nation Central, in his keynote speech. 'The ability of Israeli companies to deliver, even during crises, continues to position Israel as a leading hub for innovation.' Hason noted that high-tech accounts for 20% of Israel’s GDP and half of its exports. But despite more than a year of war, Israeli high-tech has demonstrated resilience, raising over $10 billion in venture investments in 2024 alone. Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital, shared an optimistic outlook on the country’s technological trajectory. 'Israel’s leadership in dual-use technologies — blending civilian and military applications– is unparalleled,' said Maguire. 'The rise of defense-tech is redefining the startup world, turning once-taboo industries into the hottest investment arenas.' Startups in the Spotlight A highlight of the summit was the demo session, where startups showcased technologies shaping the future of defense. Among the featured startups was Haifa-based XMetix, represented by CTO Eran Kuhnreich, who introduced the world’s first automatic personal tourniquet, designed for rapid response during mass casualty events. XMetix’s smart tourniquet, controlled by sophisticated software, requires just one button press to activate and stop the bleeding. This fully automatic device minimizes human error and operates with speed and ease of use, making it suitable for both military and civilian environments. 'This device is intuitive and saves lives within seconds,' Kuhnreich explained. Spear UAV, another participant at the summit, presented its Viper family of loitering munitions. The company, founded in 2017, develops encapsulated drones that can be launched from air, sea, or land. 'We are redefining the battlefield with AI-powered, cross-platform solutions that offer real-time situational awareness and precision targeting,' explained Itamar Ben-Tuvim, the Chief Business Development Officer of the Tel Aviv-based startup. According to conference chairman Prof. Isaac Ben-Israel, startups will play a key role in making sure Israel maintains a technological edge. 'Against the backdrop of the current war, the Israel Ministry of Defense reports a significant increase in engagements with 86 Israeli startups and small companies, amounting to approximately 601 million shekels ($168 million) between October 2023 and September 2024 – five times more than the same period last year.' Looking to the future, Zamir said, 'In a decade, AI-based autonomous systems will lead combat operations across land, sea, and air, reshaping how wars are fought. We must integrate these capabilities now to remain efficient and save lives.'

IDF blocked Iranian planes sent to assist Assad – report	This could be at least one reason why the Syrian regime folded so quickly. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF prevented Iranian planes from landing in Syria over the ten last days of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in an act that hastened the rebels’ victory, Walla reported Wednesday. Army intelligence learned that Iran had decided that the fighting that erupted between Sunni Islamic jihadists and the Syrian army was a dangerous and growing threat that required its assistance with both advisers and arms, and wanted to land planes full of both in airfields throughout the country. The IDF received permission from the highest political echelon to prevent this in various ways, according to the report. Iranian pilots who arrived in the area, for example, received notices to return to their points of origin because they were not authorized to land. The Israeli military has used this tactic multiple times in Lebanon, when Iranian aircraft bringing aid bound for Hezbollah were prevented from landing at Beirut’s international airport. In the last days, the report said, Iran also tried sending empty planes to try to quickly evacuate their senior officials with their families, as well as top Syrian allies, from the country. According to the report, when the IDF identified these planes, they were allowed to land in order to facilitate the withdrawal of Iranian officials responsible over the last several years for efforts to build an Iranian presence over Israel’s northeastern border. The IDF does not know how many planes were prevented from reaching Syria, but army sources are convinced that the action created a chain effect and deepened the pressure on the Syrian regime, the report said. The reported Israeli move may have fed the false claim the Iranians have advanced that both the U.S. and Israel were behind the overthrow of their ally, which was made to excuse their failure to save Assad. It had surprised many that Iran did not seem to make a serious effort to prop up the regime, as it had very successfully, along with major assistance from Hezbollah and Russia, during the civil war that engulfed the country in 2011. Active fighting ending in 2018, with Assad in control of central Syria but other parts held by various forces, including the jihadists, who occupied and ran the Idlib region before breaking out in late November after a ceasefire was signed between a much weakened Hezbollah and Israel. Syria was perhaps the crown jewel in the Islamic Republic’s so-called 'ring of fire' around Israel. With borders along the Jewish state, Lebanon and Iraq, it was perfectly placed to route arms and missiles through compliant terror groups in southern Iraq to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran’s largest proxy army against Israel. It also acted as a forward base for Iran itself, leading to the IDF regularly bombing its military sites in Syria in what was known in Israel as a 'war between the wars.'

10-year-old murdered, 3 wounded in terror shooting targeting bus	The boy was traveling with his family on a bus bound for Jerusalem; terrorist opened fire, struck bus more than 20 times. By World Israel News Staff A ten-year-old boy was murdered in a terror attack targeting a public bus in the Jerusalem area on Wednesday evening, which also wounded three other people. The boy, identified as Yehoshua Aharon Tuvia Simcha, was traveling with his family on a bus bound for Jerusalem. Around 11:30 p.m., a terrorist opened fire at the Al-Khader Junction near Bethlehem, hitting the bus more than 20 times. Footage of the incident circulating on social media showed women and children fleeing the bullet-ridden bus and running towards security forces at a nearby checkpoint, at the entrance to Jerusalem. Magen David Adom paramedics said that they rushed Simcha, who sustained gunshot wounds to his upper body, to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in Jerusalem. 'Unfortunately, after intensive and prolonged resuscitation efforts, the medical team was forced to declare the death of the child, who was evacuated from the attack in critical condition to the trauma unit at Hadassah Ein Kerem,' the hospital said in a media statement. 'Our hearts go out to the family at this difficult time.' The victim is the son of Rabbi Zusha Simcha, the head of a Hasidic yeshiva in Beitar Illit, according to Hebrew-language media reports. A woman in her 40s, who was also shot in the attack, was transported to Sha'are Tzedek Hospital in Jerusalem, where she is listed as being in moderate condition. Two other people were hurt by shattering glass and transported to medical centers for treatment, while others were treated by paramedics at the scene for anxiety. The terrorist who perpetrated the attack was still at large, as of Thursday morning. Israeli security forces set up checkpoints and roadblocks around the city of Bethlehem, where it's believed the shooter fled. 'The terrible attack tonight is not a matter of fate. In Judea and Samaria, too, the time has come to mobilize the population, to maneuver within the cities, and to destroy terrorist infrastructure,' said the Yesha Regional Council in a statement. 'There is no difference between the enemy in Gaza and the enemy in Bethlehem. Terrorism is the same terrorism. The solution must be the same.'

BBC reporter ridiculed for saying Jews form Syria’s ‘diverse popu...	In the 1940s, Syria's Jewish community was 40,000 strong. Today just an estimated 3 remain.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A BBC reporter was ridiculed after saying that Jews have and will comprise Syria's 'diverse' population, the Jewish Chronicle reports. Reporting live from Damascus, the BBC’s chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet said Jews will likely be comfortable returning to the Old City and to live among Muslim and Christian neighbors. Doucet said, 'This is one of the most diverse countries in the Middle East with multiple Christian [and] Muslim sects and you can see it here in the Old City, all the different quarters, Jewish, Muslim, Christian - they’re all here and they want to believe they have a space now as Syria embarks on this new chapter.' The remarks were greeted with outrage and mockery with many pointing out that after an ethnic cleansing of Jews from Syria, there were just three remaining when Bashar Al-Assad was deposed. Orly Goldschmidt, The official spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy to the UK, wrote on X: 'Jewish, Muslim, Christian, they're all here, they want to believe they have a space now&#8230;' 'Except they're not. In the 1940s, Syria's Jewish community was 40,000 strong. Today just an estimated 3 remain.' 'Good luck finding a Jew in Syria for an interview.' The Board of Deputies’ Director of Public Affairs Daniel Sugarman wrote, 'You may find a ‘Jewish Quarter’ in Damascus. You won’t find Jews to interview, though.' The ethnic cleansing of Jews from Arab lands is something that all post-colonial theorists across the world will ignore, deny or downplay,' Sugarman posted on X. Many commenters said Doucet was misleading the public about the history of antisemitism in Syria. Her remarks follow a statement by BBC’s international editor Jeremy Bowen that Israel preferred a 'weak dictator' like Assad to a 'self-confident Islamist militia.' Bowen also asserted Israeli strikes against chemical weapons sites and other military targets in Syria may have prevented a peaceful transition of power. 'Israeli troops and tanks have moved into Syria to create what Israel calls a buffer zone to protect its borders. It has alarmed the UN [United Nations] and others who believe a political process is better for the Syrians and their neighbours than a preemptive military offensive,' the international editor said.

Coalition defeats opposition’s proposal for probe into October 7 ...	Benjamin Netanyahu stated at a press conference that 'many citizens' were opposed to the investigation. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Israeli government defeated a symbolic proposal put forward by the opposition to establish a National Commission of Inquiry into the October 7 massacre. The measure was proposed after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at a press conference that 'many citizens were opposed' to the investigation. MK Pnina Tameno-Shete (National Unity) wrote the 'agenda proposal,' a motion that allows Knesset members to suggest ideas to the plenum. It is not a piece of legislation and has mainly symbolic value. This development comes as Likud MK Ariel Kallner is working on an alternative commission of inquiry, with members set to be appointed equally by both the coalition and the opposition. If the motion had passed, more time would have been granted to debate its merits. MK Benny Gantz (National Unity), who presented the proposal, accused the government of striking it down to avoid taking responsibility for the failures that led to the massacre. Gantz said, 'Our people are not foolish; they understand exactly what you're trying to do. It won't work. We see through your actions. We see the hypocrisy and the transparent attempt to undermine trust in an institution that you all once praised.' A National Commission of Inquiry is the highest level of investigation and works independently of the political echelon. The Chief Justice appoints members of the National Commission of Inquiry, who are empowered to subpoena witnesses and conduct inquiries. Earlier on Wednesday, the High Court of Justice heard arguments in a petition filed by The Zulat Institute, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel (MQG), a group of 86 former Members of Knesset, and others, calling on the government to establish the inquiry. The attorney general argued that the government must agree to discuss the issue, noting that an investigation would be impaired if too much time passes.

There are indications that Israel and Hamas may be approaching a hostages-for-ceasefire deal, with conflicting reports on whether Hamas has provided Egypt with a list of individual hostages. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz told US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin that there is a 'good chance now' for a hostage release deal. He added that after the massacre of October 7th, Israelis are not willing to risk their security, which is one of the reasons the IDF has destroyed strategic targets in Syria to dismantle former leader Assad's military capabilities. Regarding the ceasefire in Lebanon, Katz said there would be 'zero tolerance' for violations. Katz and Austin agreed that Iran poses a major threat, and the two said they would strive to prevent smuggling of weapons to Lebanon via Syria. There are indications that Israel and Hamas may be approaching a hostages-for-ceasefire deal, with conflicting reports on whether Hamas has provided Egypt with a list of individuals—ill, wounded, female, and elderly—who could be released as part of the first phase of such an agreement. A Monday report from the London-based Al-Araby Al-Jadeed claimed that Hamas had handed over a list of hostages to Egyptian intelligence, along with a corresponding list of Palestinian prisoners it seeks to have released in return. The Qatari news outlet also mentioned that four American hostages, who do not meet the specified criteria, were included on the list. Of the eight Israelis with American citizenship believed to be held in Gaza, three are still assumed to be alive: Keith Siegel, who at 65 could be considered elderly; lone soldier Edan Alexander, 20, who was recently featured in a Hamas propaganda video; and Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, from Kibbutz Nir Oz. A senior Hamas official in Lebanon, Ahmed Abdel Hadi, denied the report on Wednesday, telling the local outlet Al Mayadeen that no such list had been provided. He also rejected an Israeli report from the previous week that claimed Israel had presented Egyptian negotiators with an updated version of the ceasefire deal, which had been stalled for months. Hadi stated, 'There was no Zionist offer… nor were there any new ideas for us to consider.'

Jewish ace Max Fried signs record-breaking contract with the New ...	Fried, a Los Angeles native who grew up worshiping Hall of Famer and fellow Jewish southpaw Sandy Koufax, will likely spend the remainder of his career playing in the city with the most Jews in the world. By Jacob Gurvis, JTA Jewish pitcher Max Fried has reportedly signed an eight-year, $218 million contract with the New York Yankees, the largest contract ever for a Jewish player as well as for a left-handed pitcher. Fried, who turns 31 in January, entered the MLB off season as one of the most coveted free agents on the market after a dazzling eight-year run with the Atlanta Braves that included one World Series title. Now he joins a Yankees team coming off not only a World Series defeat but the stinging loss of superstar outfielder Juan Soto, a generational talent who signed a $765 million megadeal with the crosstown Mets. Fried, a Los Angeles native who grew up worshiping Hall of Famer, and fellow Jewish southpaw, Sandy Koufax, will likely spend the remainder of his career playing in the city with the most Jews in the world. He joins fellow Jewish pitcher Scott Effross, who was traded to the Yankees in 2022 but missed all of 2023 and most of 2024 with multiple injuries. (And Jewish Yankees pitching prospect Eric Reyzelman is working his way through the minor leagues.) Some Jewish Yankees fans are already celebrating Fried’s historic signing. A JEWISH MAX ON THE YANKEES! WE DID IT! &mdash; Max Mannis (@MaxMannis) December 10, 2024 Fried has a 3.07 ERA in 151 career starts and is a two-time All-Star, a three-time Gold Glove winner, a Silver Slugger winner, and a 2021 World Series champion. He finished as the runner-up in the 2022 National League Cy Young race. In 2024, Fried posted an 11-10 record with a 3.25 ERA and 166 strikeouts in 174.1 innings. Fried’s $218 million deal, first reported Tuesday by ESPN’s Jeff Passan, is the largest contract in baseball history for a left-handed pitcher in raw terms, topping David Price’s seven-year, $217 million contract signed with the Boston Red Sox in 2015. It’s also by far the most lucrative contract ever for a Jewish player, more than doubling fellow free agent Alex Bregman’s five-year, $100 million contract extension with the Houston Astros in 2019. Shawn Green had previously signed for $84 million with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1999. Bregman, who is currently considered the top free-agent hitter still available, could well blow past Fried’s $218 million deal. Bregman is a two-time All-Star with a Gold Glove, Silver Slugger and two World Series titles. The Astros and Red Sox are rumored to be the favorites to land the 30-year-old third baseman. Jewish players Joc Pederson, Kevin Pillar, and Rowdy Tellez are all free agents as well.

By Pesach Benson, TPS Three Israeli mathematicians officially received the prestigious Rousseeuw Prize for Statistics in Belgium, where 'protests by students and faculty members have called for a full academic boycott of Israeli universities,' Tel Aviv University announced on Wednesday. The $1 million prize, established as an equivalent of the Nobel Prize which does not include mathematical disciplines, recognizes outstanding contributions in statistics that profoundly impact science and society. Protesters demonstrated outside the ceremony at Catholic University of Leuven, which took place on Dec. 3, Tel Aviv University said. Prof. Yoav Benjamini, Prof. Daniel Yekutieli and Prof. Ruth Heller from TAU’s Department of Statistics and Operations Research were honored for their work on the False Discovery Rate (FDR), a statistical methodology for discovering errors among large datasets. Controlling the FDR ensures that the proportion of false positives remains within an acceptable range, making the results more reliable. 'The idea of the FDR originated from the need of medical researchers to examine numerous factors indicating treatment success,' said Benjamini. 'However, in statistics, once a new method is established in one research area, its impact can expand to others. Indeed, FDR methods are now widely applied in diverse fields such as: genomics—where relations between tens of thousands of genetic markers of a specific disease are examined; neuroscience – testing which regions in the brain are activated when a certain task, such as face recognition, is performed; agriculture, economics, behavioral sciences, astronomy, and more,' he explained 'What these fields share is the need to scan massive amounts of possible results within mountains of data to identify significant discoveries.'

Entertainment, sports and war top 2024 Google searches in Israel	Crumble cake headed the list of recipe searches in Israel, followed by honey cake, 'key' challah, and bento cakes. By JNS A mix of entertainment, sports and the war against Hamas in Gaza were the top Google search items in Israel over the last year, according to statistics released this week by the world’s most popular internet search engine. The Euro 2024 soccer championship, Israeli singer-songwriter and actor Idan Amedi, the Israel Defense Forces’ Home Front Command, which offered information about rocket attacks, Israel’s version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' and assassinated Hamas chief Mohammed Deif topped the list of most searched items on Google, according to the website’s 'Year in Search 2024.' Iran came in sixth, followed by the Israeli singer Lior Farhi and Israel’s wartime Eurovision contender Eden Golan; two reality shows closed out the top 10 list. Crumble cake headed the list of recipe searches in Israel, followed by honey cake, 'key challah' and bento cakes. The most asked 'why' questions on Google in Israel were: Why does one eat dairy on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot (which marks the harvest festival and the giving of the Bible); why does one fast on Tisha B’Av (which commemorates the destruction of the two ancient Jewish temples); why does one fast on Yom Kippur; why didn’t Moses enter the Land of Israel; and why does one celebrate Shavuot. The top 'how' searches on Google in Israel last year were: How does one prepare parmesan, how to vote in the Eurovision Song Contest, how did Michael Jackson die, how to make sweet cream and how to peel a pomegranate.

‘For Palestine’ – Congresswoman’s home targeted by bomb threat	Bomb squad dispatched to Republican lawmaker's private residence after she received email claiming a pipe bomb had been hidden in her mailbox - on behalf of Palestine. By World Israel News Staff A Republican congresswoman received a pro-Palestinian bomb threat this week, which tragically ended in an accident which fatally killed a woman. On Monday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene received a bomb threat to her private residence in Georgia, via an email which claimed that a pipe bomb had been left in her mailbox. 'The Rome Police Department's Assistant Chief of Police received an email containing a bomb threat directed towards me,' Greene tweeted, including video footage of a bomb squad inspecting the mailbox in question. Greene wrote that police had traced the source of the threatening email to a Russian internet protocol (IP) address. 'Due to the international nature and severity of this threat, my office is collaborating closely with local and federal law enforcement, including the FBI, to ensure the perpetrator is brought to justice.' 'After receiving this threat, the Rome Police Department quickly dispatched their Bomb Squad to my home to ensure there was no active threat. Unfortunately, this is not the first time the Rome Police Department has been dispatched to my home.' 'Since being elected to Congress, I have been swatted at least nine times—deliberate attempts to provoke a deadly police response through false and highly exaggerated threats.' The email which included the bomb threat was headed 'For Palestine,' and included details on the alleged pipe bomb. 'Using a 1&#215;8-inch threated galvanized pipe, end caps, a kitchen timer, some wires, metal clips, and homemade black powder, I've constructed a pipe bomb which I recently hid in Marjorie Taylor Greene's mailbox,' the email reads. 'Even if Marjorie does not open the mailbox herself I'm still satisfied with the prospect of some pig cops losing their lives of being injured. VIVA VIVA PALESTINA.' Greene lamented that during the police investigation into the bomb threat, a woman was killed in a traffic accident involving police responding to the threat. 'I’m heartsick right now. I was just informed that an innocent woman died today in an auto accident involving a member of the Rome Police bomb squad who was responding to the threat at my home.' One officer was injured in the crash.

‘The Pope can’t rewrite the Bible,’ says Evangelical leader	American Evangelical Christian leader denounces Vatican Nativity scene display showing baby Jesus with a Palestinian keffiyeh. By World Israel News Staff An Evangelical Christian activist has taken aim at a Vatican Nativity scene display which portrayed Jesus as a Palestinian, accusing the Vatican of historical - and religious - revisionism. Laurie Cardoza-Moore, President of Proclaiming Justice to The Nations, condemned the Pope’s inauguration earlier this week in Vatican City of a nativity scene which featured baby Jesus lying on a Palestinian keffiyeh. 'While Israel is fighting for her very existence on seven fronts, antisemites within the Vatican have tried to steal Christmas,' Cardoza-Moore said Wednesday. 'The Pope’s inauguration of a nativity scene that showed baby Jesus cradled in a Palestinian keffiyeh is an affront to Jesus, the Bible, and the eighty percent of Christians who have fled Bethlehem since the Palestinian Authority took over the city.' Cardoza-Moore, whose weekly television show Focus on Israel has an audience of over two billion potential viewers worldwide called the Nativity scene display an attempt by 'subversive' elements within the church to 'hijack' Christmas for political ends. 'Let’s be clear. The Pope can’t rewrite the Bible - Jesus was a Jew from Judea, not a Palestinian. He was born to a Jewish mother in Bethlehem, in Judea – there was no Palestine.' 'Every year, subversive elements within the Church attempt to hijack the holiday and pull the Keffiyeh over our eyes – but it will never work. Instead of paying homage to this blasphemy, the Pope should be publicly supporting the State of Israel in her fight for survival.' 'I would call on all Christians to open their Bible and read. There is no mention of Arafat, Sinwar, or the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The Bible was written in Hebrew, not Arabic. It is time that we wake up and listen to the rhetoric coming out of Teheran and their proxies: first, they are coming for the Saturday People (the Jews) and then, the Sunday People (the Christians).' 'Christians in Israel enjoy full rights under the law. Many Christians are currently fighting in the Israel Defense Forces, on the front lines. Meanwhile, Christians in Bethlehem are second class citizens. The tiny minority which remains in the Holy City is forced to conform with the Palestinian revisionist narrative or else.' 'Pope Francis would do well to read the book of Obadiah, where God told the Prophet that in the last days, He would wipe out the descendants of Edom because they stood by, while their brother Jacob (Israel) was held in captivity and did nothing.'

Report: Hamas ready to finalize hostage deal	There are contradictory reports on whether Hamas gave Egypt a list of ill, wounded, female and elderly candidates for the first part of the deal. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News There are some indications that Israel and Hamas may be nearing a hostages-for-ceasefire agreement, with conflicting reports emerging on whether Hamas gave Egypt a list of ill, wounded, female and elderly candidates for release in the first part of such a deal. According to a Monday report in the London-based Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, a list of hostages was handed over to Egyptian intelligence officials along with a parallel list of names of Palestinian prisoners Hamas wants in exchange. The Qatari news outlet also reported that four American hostages who do not fit the criteria were also on the list. Of eight Israelis with American citizenship believed to be held in Gaza, three are still assumed to be alive - Keith Siegel, who at 65 could be considered elderly, lone soldier Edan Alexander (20), who was recently featured in a Hamas propaganda video, and Sagui Dekel-Chen (35), of Kibbutz Nir Oz. A top Hamas official in Lebanon, Ahmed Abdel Hadi, denied the report Wednesday, telling local outlet Al Mayadeen that no such list had been provided. He also denied an Israeli report last week that Israel had provided Egyptian negotiators with a new version of the ceasefire deal that had been in the freezer for months, saying 'There was no Zionist offer&#8230; nor were there any new ideas for us to consider.' The updated version reportedly offered a 42-to-60 day ceasefire while male hostages over age 50, and all female and hostages in precarious medical conditions would be periodically freed. Hope for progress also came from a lightning visit that Shabak head Ronen Bar and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi paid to Cairo Tuesday. In talks with their respective counterparts that also focused on the fall of the Syrian regime, the two discussed a potential hostage deal and what possible flexibility there could be regarding an IDF pullout from the Philadelphi Corridor, the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza that contains the former major Hamas weapons-smuggling routes, both under and above ground. Hamas has reportedly softened its long-held stance, opening to the idea of a temporary ceasefire rather than a permanent one and possible IDF departure only from the Rafah border area initially and not the entire Gaza Strip, before releasing hostages. Who would take charge of the vital area is still up in the air, with the Palestinian Authority being a possibility, although the right-wing members of the government have adamantly opposed the idea in the past. According to a report by Yedioth Aharanoth on Wednesday, senior Israeli officials were informed Tuesday night that Hamas is seeking to reach an agreement regarding a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, though sources cited in the report denied that a list of hostages had been given by Hamas to Israel via Egypt. 'We're not there yet,' said a source familiar with the matter. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan will visit Israel Thursday before going on to mediators Qatar and Egypt to push for a deal before Donald Trump is inaugurated as president on January 20. National Security Council Communications Adviser John Kirby said Tuesday that the Biden administration was working 'extremely hard,' although 'I am not in a position today where I can tell you that we have a deal that is on the brink of completion&#8230;. We do think there’s an opportunity here to get a hostage deal in place.' He also put the ball squarely in Hamas’ court, saying, 'Hamas continues to be the obstacle to that outcome, but we’re pressing on it really, really, hard with that.' He sounded a cautiously optimistic note after referring to the recent implosion of Syria due to its main allies’ inability to protect the now-fallen regime. Hamas, he said, 'absolutely ought to move because there is nobody coming to their assistance there. They can’t rely on Hezbollah. They certainly can’t rely on Iran. This is the time to make a deal.'

Israel colluded with US to depose Assad, claims Ayatollah	Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, claims Tehran has evidence that Assad's ouster was part of a coup orchestrated by Israel and the US. By World Israel News Staff The United States and Israel colluded together to orchestrated the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad over the weekend, coordinating the Syrian rebel attack on the capital city of Damascus, Iran's supreme leader claimed Wednesday. According to a report by IRNA, a mouthpiece of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed that Iran possesses evidence showing that Washington and Jerusalem were responsible for the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria - a key ally of Tehran. 'There should be no doubt that what happened in Syria is the result of a joint American and Zionist plan.' Khamenei was quoted as saying. 'Yes, the neighboring country of Syria has played a clear role in this matter and continues to do so—this is evident to all—but the primary conspirator, the main planner, and the central command room are in the United States and the Zionist regime. We have evidence. This evidence leaves no room for doubt,' Khamenei continued. The Shi'ite cleric vowed that Iran and its proxies would ratchet up their 'resistance' to the West following the collapse of the Assad regime. 'This is resistance. This is the front of resistance: the more pressure is applied, the stronger it becomes.' 'The more atrocities are committed, the more motivated it becomes. The more it is fought, the more it expands. And I tell you that with the power of God, the scope of resistance will encompass the entire region more than before.' Pushing back on reports that the damage done to Hamas and Hezbollah during their wars with Israel, coupled with the collapse of the Assad regime, have left Iran's overseas efforts in disarray, Khamenei said his country 'is strong.' 'That ignorant analyst, unaware of the meaning of resistance, imagines that if resistance weakens, Islamic Iran will also weaken,' Khamenei said. 'And I say, with the help and strength of God, by His permission, Iran is strong, powerful, and will become even more powerful.'

US boxing legend accosted by UK mob over Israel support	Retired boxer Floyd Mayweather, an outspoken supporter of Israel, was surrounded by a mob and physically attacked over his pro-Israel positions during a visit to London. By World Israel News Staff American boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. was accosted by an anti-Israel mob recently during a visit to London, after the locals spotted the prominent pro-Israel pugilist shopping. The incident occurred Tuesday evening while Mayweather was patronizing a jewelry shop in the Hatton Garden neighborhood. According to a report by The Sun which cited a source close to the boxer, while Mayweather was shopping, a group of roughly ten people surrounded him, hurling racial slurs and lambasting him over his public support for the Jewish state. Roughly two dozen others watched the event, the report said, as the mob peppered him with questions regarding his stance on Israel. When asked why he supports Israel, Mayweather said he was 'proud' of it, the source said. At one point, one man attempted to strike the former boxer, before Mayweather's bodyguards escorted him out of the store. Mayweather confirmed the incident in an Instagram post Tuesday night, but downplayed the incident, denying rumors he had been injured during the confrontation. 'Let me set the record straight&#8230;there's no truth to the rumors going around. I wasn't punched or touched in any way.' 'What you're seeing is just my security doing their job to keep things under control.' 'I was in the UK for a quick 48-hour stop to do some shopping, and unfortunately, people let jealousy and negativity fuel false stories. I'm perfectly fine, and there's really nothing more to it.' Mayweather has publicly promoted a number of Israeli charities in recent years. On Sunday, he announced the launch of the Mayweather Israel Initiative, which supports Israeli orphans. 'I’m proud to announce the Mayweather Israel Initiative,' Mayweather wrote on Instagram. 'Over the next year, every orphan in Israel will be visited by the Floyd Mobile and receive special birthday gifts.' 'To all the widows and orphans: keep your heads held high as we honor the cherished memories of those who have passed. A heartfelt thank you to Shai Graucher for your incredible work in making this possible.'

Ex-hostage to Trump: ‘Free them all, I trust you’	Freed American-Israeli hostage urges Donald Trump to do 'everything in his power' to save the captives still held in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff A former Hamas hostage urged president-elect Donald Trump to do 'everything in his power' to free the hostages still held in Gaza, as the two met on his Florida golf course. Judith Ranaan, an American-Israeli, was kidnapped on October 7th alongside her 17-year-old daughter. Ranaan and her daughter live in the Chicago area. They were visiting family in Kibbutz Nahal Oz during the Jewish High Holidays when the terror onslaught began. On October 20th, the pair were the first to be freed by the terror group, after being held for nearly two weeks in the Gaza Strip. Ranaan met briefly with Trump on one of his golf courses in Florida, gifting him with an original painting that she created. According to a summary of the meeting published by Bring Them Home Now on X, Ranaan's main message to Trump was that she 'trusts him.' She also asked that Trump 'do everything in his power to bring all the hostages home - the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial.' Trump has warned the Hamas terror group that he expects the hostages to be freed by the time he takes office on January 20th. If not, Trump recently threatened on X, there will be 'hell to pay.' Many hostage families have expressed optimism that Trump's tough stance on Hamas increases the pressure on the terror group to accept a deal. 'I have a strong conviction that we will bring everyone home—both those alive and those who are not,' Adam Boehler, Trump’s special envoy for hostage issues, recently said. 'The president’s insistence on achieving this before his inauguration has already catalyzed significant progress in negotiations.' It's unclear how many of the some 100 hostages in captivity are still alive. At least 34 of those captives are confirmed to be dead.

House elects Brian Mast, U.S. army veteran who assisted Israeli s...	Mast wore his Israeli army uniform to Congress in the days after Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas massacred 1,200 people inside Israel and took hundreds hostage. By Ron Kampeas, JTA The House of Representatives elected Florida Rep Brian Mast, a zealous pro-Israel Republican who has volunteered with a group that assists the Israeli army, to chair the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee. Mast bested three other contenders to succeed Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, who is term-limited. Insiders say that President-elect Donald Trump lobbied the Republican Steering Committee, which names committee chairs, to choose Mast. 'I have no doubt Congressman Mast — a distinguished combat veteran and experienced member of this committee — will serve the nation well in this role, as he sacrificed in Afghanistan,' McCaul said in a statement. Mast, 44, first endorsed Trump in 2016, when Mast himself was first running for Congress, and has been one of his most loyal defenders in the body, taking a prominent role in this year’s campaign. Mast is also aligned with Trump’s more isolationist bent, opposing U.S. support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. McCaul and the three other contenders, Reps. Joe Wilson of South Carolina, Anne Wagner of Missouri and Darrell Issa of California, are more aligned with traditional Republican internationalist principles. Mast, a Christian and military veteran who lost both legs on duty in Afghanistan in 2010, volunteered in 2015 with Sar-El, a group that places civilians from abroad in support positions with the Israeli army. He has said the experience helped shape him. A dedicated page on his congressional website describes the experience. 'I learned at the Shabbat tables of my hosts just how much each family truly desires peace between every neighbor of Israel, regardless of religion or history,' he said. 'We cannot let Israel face its enemies alone.' Mast wore his Israeli army uniform to Congress in the days after Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas massacred 1,200 people inside Israel and took hundreds hostage. Mast’s pro-Israel posture has often been pugnacious. California Rep. Sara Jacobs, a Jewish Democrat, last year sought to censure Mast for suggesting that there were no innocent Palestinian civilians in the war Israel was waging against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 'I would encourage the other side to not so lightly throw around the idea of innocent Palestinian civilians, as is frequently said,' Mast said at the time. 'I don’t think we would so lightly throw around the term innocent Nazi civilians during World War II.'

With Biden on his way out, GOP-led House ramps up funding for joi...	$47 million will fund U.S.-Israel collaboration on emerging defense technologies, including directed energy weapons, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Congress’s annual defense spending bill includes $500 million in funding for joint military projects with Israel, including a reversal of the Biden-Harris administration’s decision to cease production of a missile interceptor used to defend the Jewish state from Iranian attacks, sources briefed on the matter told the Washington Free Beacon. The GOP-controlled House is scheduled to vote this week on the fiscal year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), an $895 billion spending bill that is a must-pass for Congress before it breaks for the holidays. The legislation funds the American military and virtually all defense priorities across the globe. Included in the bill is $500 million for U.S.-Israel missile defense cooperation, which has emerged as a top priority for GOP lawmakers as the Jewish state continues to battle Iran-backed forces along its border. With the outgoing administration delaying some American arms shipments to Israel, Congress is working to ensure that joint defense projects are safeguarded into the next year when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The House version of the NDAA includes $47.5 million more than the White House requested for U.S.-Israel defense collaboration on emerging technologies, as well as $30 million more than requested for joint anti-tunneling projects, which are vital to ensuring Hamas and Hezbollah cannot conduct Oct. 7-style cross-border raids. It also reverses the Biden-Harris administration's decision to eliminate funding for the production of certain ship-based surface-to-air missiles that were critical to defending Israel from two separate Iranian attacks this year, according to the House Armed Services Committee. 'When I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel in October, I reiterated that Congress’s support for Israel is ironclad,' Rep. Mike Rogers (R., Ala.), the committee's chair, told the Free Beacon. This year’s NDAA, Rogers underscored, 'continues to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship by investing in U.S.-Israel military cooperation and joint exercises.' The United States spent roughly $50 million on anti-tunneling projects it conducted with the Israel Defense Forces last year. That spending is set to increase to $80 million for fiscal year 2025. Another $47 million will fund U.S.-Israel collaboration on emerging defense technologies, including directed energy weapons, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. The bill also seeks to combat growing anti-Semitism across the globe by prohibiting the Pentagon from carrying any goods produced by 'entities that have or are engaged in boycotts of Israel,' according to the House committee’s summary. It also bars the Pentagon from 'using or citing casualty data from Hamas and other terrorist organizations.'

Floyd Mayweather announces new initiative to gift Israeli orphans...	To all the widows and orphans: keep your heads held high as we honor the cherished memories of those who have passed,' Mayweather wrote in an Instagram post on Monday. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Retired boxing legend Floyd Mayweather has announced a new initiative to help Israeli orphans celebrate their birthdays. As part of the Mayweather Israel Initiative, the former undefeated boxing champion will gift every orphan in Israel birthday presents over the next year, and the gifts will be delivered by a truck Mayweather sponsored called the Floyd Mobile. Mayweather’s initiative was first announced on Sunday at an event in Israel hosted by Chessed V’Rachamim, also known as Standing Together, not long before he shared the news on social media. 'Over the next year, every orphan in Israel will be visited by the Floyd Mobile and receive special birthday gifts,' he wrote in an Instagram post on Monday. 'To all the widows and orphans: keep your heads held high as we honor the cherished memories of those who have passed.' Mayweather concluded his social media post by thanking Rabbi Shai Graucher, the founder of Chessed V’Rachamim. The organization has provided support to soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces and those impacted by the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack that took place in southern Israel last year, including monetary assistance, provisions for soldiers, and packages of essentials and toys to displaced families. Mayweather has made a number of contributions to help Israeli civilians and wounded soldiers since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. He visited teenagers whose families were murdered in the Hamas-led massacre, and in early October, Mayweather pledged $100,000 to United Hatzalah of Israel to help the emergency medical service organization purchase 100 bulletproof vests to keep its volunteers safe. At an event in late November for injured IDF soldiers, whom he recently visited, he talked about his unwavering support for the Jewish state. 'When I stood behind Israel … I felt I did what was right,' Mayweather said. 'I take my hat off to the soldiers. Those warriors in Israel — I’m behind you guys, 100 percent. Since the war has started, I’ve been to Israel four, five times. And I will be back … It’s all about peace. I’m all about peace, love, and happiness.'

Israeli startup unveils platform countering AI-driven cyber threa...	CyTwist’s solution leverages counterintelligence methodologies and hyper-targeted probability algorithms to profile threat actors and detect malicious activity in real time. By Pesach Benson, TPS CyTwist, an Israeli startup, unveiled a new cybersecurity platform on Wednesday targeting the escalating threats posed by AI-generated malware and other threats. 'The use of AI in cyberattacks is reshaping the threat landscape, enabling attackers to operate elusively and at speed, capable of gliding past traditional security solutions that rely on signatures and rules. This is where CyTwist can make a real difference,' said Eran Orzel, CEO of the Ramat Gan-based startup. The emergence of AI in cyberattacks has transformed the threat landscape, empowering cybercriminals to develop highly adaptive malware and sophisticated phishing campaigns. These AI-assisted threats exploit meticulously structured code and custom encryption, bypassing conventional defenses and posing significant risks to organizations worldwide. According to industry research, 89% of IT security teams anticipate that AI-augmented cyber threats will have a profound impact on their organizations within the next two years. This growing concern is compounded by the escalating financial toll of cyberattacks, which are increasing by 15% annually. CyTwist’s solution is purpose-built to counteract this trend, detecting malicious behavior earlier in the attack cycle and stopping invaders before they can cause harm. 'Our patented detection engine is specifically engineered to address these challenges, as demonstrated by the results of our red team simulation where we successfully intercepted AI-generated malware that evaded the EDR solution entirely. With the proliferation of AI, there is a lower threshold to create highly effective cyberattacks, and therefore an urgent need for technology like ours to provide a powerful counter,' said Orzal. CyTwist’s solution leverages counterintelligence methodologies and hyper-targeted probability algorithms to profile threat actors and detect malicious activity in real time. Its capabilities were recently validated during a red team live attack simulation with a leading telecom provider. The simulated scenario mirrored a September 2024 cyberattack against French government agencies and private companies. During the test, CyTwist’s engine analyzed suspicious code behaviors to uncover malware designed to evade traditional signature-based and rule-driven tools. The malware’s advanced techniques, evasion tactics and encryption were effectively countered by CyTwist’s technology. One standout feature of CyTwist’s platform is its agentless architecture, which integrates with existing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. Unlike traditional tools that require file scans, CyTwist detects malware based on behavioral patterns, providing a crucial advantage in identifying previously unknown threats. Compared to legacy solutions, which often rely on static signatures or predefined rules, CyTwist’s behavioral approach ensures greater adaptability to emerging and unknown threats. 'We were impressed by CyTwist’s capability of detecting a sophisticated, AI-generated malware that our EDR had failed to pick up. CyTwist provided the critical insights we needed to detect the attack in time, adding a valuable security layer against AI-generated threats and highlighting the necessity for its technology in a market lacking in similar solutions,' said the head of incident response and AppSec at a large telecom operator overseeing the test.

Gaza terrorists fire four rockets at southern Israel	The IDF’s year-plus-long offensive in Gaza has greatly curbed rocket fire from the Strip, although terrorists in the enclave still intermittently target the Jewish state. By JNS Palestinian terrorists in the Gaza Strip fired four rockets at southern Israel on Wednesday morning, setting off sirens in several towns and villages along the border. The Israel Defense Forces intercepted two of the rockets, with the others impacting in open areas, causing no damage. The IDF’s year-plus-long offensive in Gaza has greatly curbed rocket fire from the Strip, although terrorists in the enclave still intermittently target the Jewish state. Last week, the Israeli Air Force intercepted one rocket fired from the northern Gaza Strip. On Nov. 21, terrorist forces in Gaza launched a rocket at the border community of Kerem Shalom, triggering sirens in the kibbutz, located at the Gaza-Israel-Egypt border near the crossing of the same name. The rocket was successfully intercepted, causing no injuries or damage. A rocket from Gaza set off sirens in Kibbutz Erez on Nov. 13, impacting in an open area. No injuries were reported. The community is located less than a mile from the Strip’s northern border and is the namesake of the Erez Crossing. On Nov. 25, the Israeli military reported that Abd el-Halim Abu Hussein, the head of rocket operations for Hamas’s Western Jabalia battalion, was among several terrorists killed in an Israeli airstrike in the northern Gaza city. He was responsible for numerous rocket and mortar attacks against Israeli civilians, as well as against Israeli forces in Gaza.

Biden official pushing for hostage deal ‘within days’ – Report	White House pushing for agreement before president-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20th. By World Israel News Staff A senior Biden administration official is traveling to the Middle East in a final push for a hostage deal, aiming for an agreement before president-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20th. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan will visit Israel, Qatar, and Egypt this week, where he'll meet with officials to discuss ongoing efforts for a deal that would free the Israeli hostages held for 14 months by the Hamas terror group. Two sources with insider knowledge of Sullivan's agenda told Axios that he plans to tell officials to 'do what it takes to conclude the deal within days and start implementing it as soon as possible.' White House spokesperson John Kirby said at a media conference on Tuesday that while 'we are not on the verge of completion of a deal, but we think there is a chance to get a deal done. There is still work to do. Hamas remains the obstacle and we are pressing hard.' Trump's upcoming inauguration and threats of serious consequences should the hostages remain in captivity have put significant pressure on the terror group, and Hamas' leadership are now far more open to negotiations, sources said. 'Until recently, the thinking in Israel was that Hamas doesn't want a deal — now it seems that there is a shift and that Hamas may have changed its mind,' a senior Israeli official told Axios. 'There is a chance of reaching a deal in the coming month before Biden ends his presidency,' the official added. On Tuesday, Sullivan met with the families of American hostages at the White House. Details about the meeting were not made public, but participants said they had discussed ongoing efforts by the Biden administration to secure the release of their loved ones.

Hostage daughter to Biden – ‘Why didn’t you threaten like Trump?’	Daughter of Israeli-American captives slams Biden, world leaders for not demanding the release of the hostages 'or else.' By World Israel News Staff The daughter of two slain hostages slammed President Joe Biden and other world leaders, saying that president-elect Donald Trump's recent tweet threatening the Hamas terror group should have served as an example for the international community. 'All world leaders should have done on October 8, 2023, what Trump did in his tweet,' said Iris Weinstein Haggai told the Times of Israel, referencing the president-elect's pledge that there would be 'hell to pay' for Hamas if they do not release the hostages in the near future. Weinstein Haggai's parents, Gadi and Judi, held both Israel and American citizenship. The couple were brutally murdered in their Kibbutz Nir Oz home during the October 7th terror onslaught, and their bodies were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip. 'Our situation would have been a lot different. We would have saved many lives — not only Israelis, not only hostages’ but also Palestinians — if only world leaders took a stand for the unconditional release of all these hostages,' she told TOI. She said that her criticism 'definitely' applies to Biden, adding that while she appreciated his support for Israel in the immediate aftermath of the massacres, his calls for Hamas to release the hostages were not forceful enough. 'The demand for them to be released ‘or else,’ is what I’m looking for,' Weinstein Haggai said. Biden and other world leaders' failure to threaten serious consequences against Hamas for continuing to hold the hostages had drawn out the war and destruction in the Strip, she said. 'When these Hamas terrorists… see that world leaders don’t pressure them… it sends a message to them that they can execute six beautiful young people and there are no consequences, that they can release these propaganda videos and nobody’s going to do anything,' Weinstein Haggai continued. It's 'never too late' for world leaders to adopt Trump's stance towards Hamas, she said.

US aid group purges dozens of pro-Hamas employees	Washington D.C.-based charity World Central Kitchen fires dozens of Gaza employees accused of terror ties. By World Israel News Staff A Washington D.C.-based charity has purged its employee rolls of dozens of Palestinian Arabs from the Gaza Strip, after Israel accused them of ties to terrorism. Three workers at the World Central Kitchen group told Reuters Tuesday that the aid group had fired 62 of its 500 Gaza employees over ties to terror groups including Hamas. Israel had informed the World Central Kitchen that the employees in question had ties to terrorism, an internal memo to the charity's workers said Tuesday, while emphasizing that the organization itself had no specific evidence regarding the fired workers' affiliation with terrorist groups. 'This should not be taken as a conclusion by WCK that the individuals are affiliated with any terror organization,' the memo reads. 'We do not know the basis for Israel’s decision to flag these individuals.' The decision to fire the 62 employees was taken 'to protect our team and our operations.' Israeli intelligence suspects that World Central Kitchen employees took part in the October 7th massacres in southwestern Israel, an Israeli security official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters. Israel has publicly accused Ahed Azmi Qdeih, a World Central Kitchen worker, of participating in the October 7th attacks. The Israeli Air Force killed Qdeih in an airstrike in Gaza on November 30th. Revelations of Qdeih's terror ties and involvement in the October 7th attacks led to a wider Israeli probe of World Central Kitchen employees, the official told Reuters, during which other suspected terrorists were identified. The 62 Gaza employees named by Israel's probe were found to have 'affiliations and direct connections' with terror groups including Hamas, the Israeli security official said. 'Consequently, senior Israeli officials demanded that WCK terminate the employment of those workers.'

Netanyahu: 'We have no intention of interfering in Syria's internal affairs; however, we will do whatever is necessary to ensure our security.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister sent a message to Syria of openness to good relations, but an intention to act swiftly and decisively to threats. The Prime Minister began his remarks from the Kirya in Tel Aviv, saying, 'We have no intention of interfering in Syria's internal affairs; however, we will do whatever is necessary to ensure our security.' He then referenced Operation 'Bashan Arrow,' stating, 'I authorized the Air Force to target and destroy strategic military assets left by the Syrian military to prevent them from falling into the hands of jihadists.' 'This is similar to the action taken by the British Air Force when they bombed the fleet of the Vichy regime, which was collaborating with the Nazis, to keep it out of Nazi hands,' Netanyahu added. Addressing the new Syrian regime, he remarked, 'We are open to establishing relations with the new government in Syria, but if this regime allows Iran to re-establish itself there, facilitates the transfer of Iranian weapons, or supports Hezbollah, or if it attacks us, we will respond with force and impose a heavy price.' Netanyahu concluded, 'What happened to the previous regime will also happen to this one.' The IDF announced that it has struck 320 targets and destroyed at least 70% of Syria’s military capabilities to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorist groups, Arutz Sheva reports. More than 350 Israeli fighter jets took art in the operation 'Bashan’s Arrow' to neutralize military sites once controlled by the Assad regime which fell to rebel fighters. The IDF has established the first Israeli military presence in Syria since the end of the Yom Kippur War in 1973. The IDF stated, 'In the past 48 hours, we targeted and struck the majority of Syria’s strategic weapons stockpiles, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist groups.'

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF announced that it has struck 320 targets and destroyed at least 70% of Syria's military capabilities to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorist groups, Arutz Sheva reports. More than 350 Israeli fighter jets took art in the operation 'Bashan's Arrow' to neutralize military sites once controlled by the Assad regime which fell to rebel fighters. Among the targets were advanced military systems such as tanks, fighter jets, helicopters, air defense systems, missile-equipped ships, rockets, arms manufacturing facilities, munitions storage sites, Scud missiles, cruise missiles, coastal defense missiles, drones, and various other weaponry. The IDF has established the first Israeli military presence in Syria since the end of the Yom Kippur War in 1973. The IDF stated, 'In the past 48 hours, we targeted and struck the majority of Syria's strategic weapons stockpiles, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist groups.' Israel Defense Forces International Spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told reporters on Tuesday, 'We are taking action to prevent lethal strategic weapons from reaching hostile forces. This has been our approach for years, carried out in various ways and under different circumstances, and it continues to be our focus now.' He continued, 'Our Chief of General Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, stated that our primary focus is monitoring Iran's movements and interests. Our secondary focus is on local factions gaining control of the area—assessing their actions, behavior, and deterrence capabilities—and ensuring they do not mistakenly direct their efforts toward us.' He added, 'I’ll simply say that we’re doing our job to ensure strategic weapons don’t fall into the wrong hands. This is something that should matter to many forces in the region, not just Israel—ensuring there are no strategic threats in this area.'

Deficit explodes to $622B in just 2 months under Biden’s watch	With the national debt now approaching $36 trillion, newly appointed Trump advisor Elon Musk is warning that failure to address the deficit threatens critical programs including defense, Medicare, and Social Security. By Jewish Breaking News The federal government’s deficit is soaring to historic levels under President Joe Biden, with new data showing Washington has racked up $622 billion in red ink just two months into the fiscal year. Monday’s Congressional Budget Office report reveals a 40% surge in deficit spending compared to 2023, driven by a November shortfall of $365 billion. Even accounting for technical adjustments in payment timing, the CBO’s analysis shows the deficit running $88 billion ahead of last year’s pace. Gone are the days when trillion-dollar deficits were unthinkable, never topping $1 trillion before the Covid-19 pandemic struck. Now, with last year’s deficit hitting $1.8 trillion under Biden’s watch, they’re becoming the new normal. Making matters worse, the Fed’s inflation-fighting rate hikes have sent borrowing costs through the roof. For the first time ever, Washington’s annual interest payments topped $1 trillion. Even after counting returns on government investments, taxpayers are still on the hook for $882 billion in interest costs. With the national debt now approaching $36 trillion, newly appointed Trump advisor Elon Musk is warning that failure to address the deficit threatens critical programs including defense, Medicare, and Social Security. 'If we don’t fix the deficit, everything will suffer,' Musk wrote on X. 'It’s not optional.' Musk, alongside fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, has been tasked by the President-elect with addressing the country’s surging debt. On November 12, Donald Trump announced that the two would serve as co-heads of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly created entity focused on reducing government expenditures, slashing regulations, and enacting cost-cutting initiatives throughout the federal government. Last month, Musk promised to cut 'at least $2 trillion' from US government spending. However, budget experts say that even if the tech billionaire shut down complete federal departments such as homeland security, transportation, agriculture, and others, it still wouldn’t reach his target.

Days after Trump’s victory, Biden-Harris admin granted Iran $10 b...	This policy of appeasement needs to end on January 20, and locking down these accounts, so Iran can't get access, should be priority one,' said Richard Goldberg, a former White House National Security Council member. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon The Biden-Harris administration waived sanctions on Iran three days after the November election, providing Tehran access upward of $10 billion in once-frozen funds, according to a copy of the non-public order transmitted to Congress and reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined on November 8 that 'it is in the national security interest of the United States' to waive mandatory economic sanctions that bar Iraq from transferring upward of $10 billion to Iran in electricity import payments. The Biden-Harris administration has renewed the waiver repeatedly over the objections of congressional Republicans, who warned that the cash helped fuel terrorism and Iran's war against Israel. In one case, the administration signed off on the sanctions relief one month after Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel. The most recent iteration of the waiver lifts sanctions for 120 days, at which time the incoming Trump administration will have to decide whether Tehran will continue receiving the relief. Though the first Trump administration did green-light the same waiver—causing tension with some congressional Republicans—it narrowly tailored the waiver to restrict Iranian access to the cash. The Biden State Department tweaked the waiver last year to allow Tehran to convert the funds from Iraqi dinars to euros, then hold those euros in bank accounts based in Oman. Access to a widely traded currency like the euro enables Iran to more easily spend the cash in international markets. Under the first Trump administration, Iran had to keep the cash in an escrow account in Baghdad, making it more difficult to access. The State Department confirmed last week that it issued the waiver. 'We remain committed to reducing Iran's malign influence in the region,' State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters during a briefing. 'Our viewpoint is that a stable, sovereign, and secure Iraq is critical to these efforts.' The Biden State Department maintains that Iran is only permitted to use the funds for humanitarian needs, including medicines and other supplies. Republican critics argue that money is fungible, meaning that Tehran will have an easier time diverting its dwindling cash reserves to its regional terror proxies, such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, should it have access to the sanctioned cash for other purposes. The State Department declined to comment further. President-elect Donald Trump, who nearly bankrupted Iran during his first term in office, has pledged to restart his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Tehran. Richard Goldberg, a former White House National Security Council member who worked the Iran portfolio, welcomed that pledge. 'Joe Biden and his team are taking credit for bringing down Assad just a few weeks after renewing a sanctions waiver to give Iran access to billions of dollars,' Goldberg said. 'Give me a break. This policy of appeasement needs to end on January 20, and locking down these accounts so Iran can't get access should be priority one.'

Levant’s oldest known ritual site discovered in Galilee cave	Acoustic tests conducted in the area revealed enhanced natural acoustics, likely amplifying communal rituals involving singing, prayer, and dancing. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli archaeologists working in the Western Galilee uncovered the earliest known evidence of communal worship in the Levant, dating back approximately 35,000 years, a team of researchers from several universities announced on Tuesday. The ritual complex was found in the depths of the Manot Cave, an archaeological and paleontological site first discovered in 2008. A team of researchers from the University of Haifa, Ben-Gurion University, and Tel Aviv University, described the worship area as enclosed by natural stalagmites and featuring a turtle shell-shaped rock engraved with intricate geometric patterns. The research team’s study was recently published in the peer-reviewed PNAS journal. 'The engraved rock was deliberately positioned in the deepest, darkest part of the cave, suggesting it held significant spiritual or symbolic value,' said Haifa University’s Dr. Omry Barzilai, one of the research leaders. 'Its turtle-shell design might represent a totem or mythological figure, offering a glimpse into the spiritual world of Paleolithic hunter-gatherer groups.' The ritual complex was discovered in an area distinct from the cave’s daily activity zones, marked by ash remains suggesting the use of torches to illuminate the space. Acoustic tests conducted in the area revealed enhanced natural acoustics, likely amplifying communal rituals involving singing, prayer, and dancing. 'This is an unprecedented discovery of a space with ‘audio-visual equipment’ centered around a ritual object, providing the first evidence of communal rituals in the Levant,' said Tel Aviv University Prof. Israel Hershkovitz. He noted that darkness, often associated with rebirth and renewal, would have imbued the site with sacred significance. The ritual complex, dated to 35,000–37,000 years ago, coincides with the emergence of the Aurignacian culture, known for symbolic objects and cave paintings in Europe. Artifacts from this culture, including flint tools, bone implements, and shell beads, were also discovered in Manot Cave. In an adjacent hidden chamber, researchers uncovered a complete deer antler bearing signs of use, possibly linked to the rituals performed in the complex. 'Antlers were a key resource for crafting tools in Upper Paleolithic cultures, and their deliberate placement suggests a connection to the spiritual activities in the cave,' Barzilai explained. To confirm that the turtle-shell engravings were man-made, the researchers used a confocal microscope, a powerful imaging tool that uses laser technology and optical systems to capture highly detailed, high-resolution images of a specimen. 'The fine micro-linear scratches indicate advanced artistic skills and a deep cultural connection to symbols,' said Tel Aviv University Prof. Rachel Sarig, who led that analysis. 3D mapping of the cave further emphasized the deliberate separation between the ritual complex and daily activity areas near the entrance. 'This reinforces the idea of a designated sacred space, underscoring its importance to the community,' said Alexander Wigman, of the Israel Antiquities Authority. Manot Cave, systematically excavated since 2010, has yielded numerous significant finds, including the oldest modern human fossil discovered outside Africa. 'Identifying communal rituals in the Paleolithic era is a breakthrough in our understanding of humanity’s spiritual and social evolution, providing a profound connection to our ancient ancestors,' said Barzilai.

Birthright Israel extends age limit to 50 for volunteers helping ...	The extended age range will also allow alumni who participated in Birthright trips up to 25 years ago to revisit Israel and reconnect with the country through volunteer work. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Birthright Israel will raise the age limit for its subsidized volunteer program in Israel to 50 starting in 2025 in an effort to encourage more people to visit the Jewish state and help rebuild Gaza border communities impacted by the deadly Oct. 7 terrorist attack last year, the organization announced on Monday. 'The decision responds to the urgent needs in Israel, particularly in areas near the Gaza envelope and along the Lebanon ceasefire zone,' Birthright Israel said in a released statement. 'The program aims to mobilize volunteers to support community rebuilding efforts in these regions and assist with various projects in central Israel, including the Tel Aviv area.' The program’s age range was previously set at 18-40, but starting next year, Jewish adults until the age of 50 will be able to participate in Birthright’s volunteer activities in communities around Israel. The hands-on volunteer opportunities include assisting on restoration projects at kibbutzim and other areas majorly affected by the Oct. 7 massacre and ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Volunteers can help 'rebuild kibbutzim, support community re-building efforts, provide food security assistance, and participate in packing and distribution tasks.' Volunteers work for 4-6 hours per day and are provided with transportation to and from their volunteer sites. The extended age range will also allow alumni who participated in Birthright trips up to 25 years ago to revisit Israel and reconnect with the country through volunteer work. It additionally promotes multigenerational experiences by letting young adults volunteer alongside their parents. A total of 8,000 people have already participated in Birthright Israel’s volunteer program and the organization said it anticipates 10,000 more volunteers in 2025. 'Every Birthright participant arriving in Israel will contribute by volunteering, ensuring that giving back is a cornerstone of the Birthright experience,' said Birthright Israel CEO Gidi Mark. 'This initiative underscores Birthright Israel’s commitment to fostering global Jewish solidarity and strengthening ties to the land and people of Israel through meaningful action.' Participants of Birthright Israel’s volunteer program are reimbursed for flights (up to $900), and also receive a partial food subsidy ($100 per week) and safe housing in major cities. Applicants need to identify as Jewish, know basic English, and have a passport that is valid for at least six months after the end date of the program.

Netanyahu testifies in court, mocking ‘absurd’ charges as Israel ...	Israeli prime minister chides court after being forced to testify in court Tuesday despite unprecedented geopolitical situation including a multifront war, calls charges against him 'absurd.' By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the witness stand Tuesday, testifying in his own corruption trial in a Tel Aviv court, after the Jerusalem District Court ruled against a motion filed by the premier's attorneys to limit the amount of time he will be required to answer questions in court. With the courtroom packed with Coalition lawmakers and ministers, Netanyahu testified in the Tel Aviv District Court beginning at 10:00 a.m. Tuesday, after the Attorney-General and Jerusalem District Court rejected petitions to either delay Netanyahu's testimony or limit his time on the witness stand. Netanyahu himself reflected on the complicated geopolitical situation facing Israel, as he is called to testify for six hours a day, three days a week, from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays. 'I want to talk about it, I want to testify,' Netanyahu said of his defense in multiple corruption cases. 'I am leading Israel and the State of Israel on seven front-war, and I thought and still think I can do all these things at once.' 'But a few days ago, an earthquake happened in our region,' Netanyahu continued, referring to the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria over the weekend. 'We have already changed the face of the Middle East, and this has global effects. It requires my attention. It is possible to find a balance between the needs of the country and the needs of the trial.' The prime minister went on to mock the charges against him, in particular accusations that he manipulated government policy to ensure he would receive positive press coverage, calling the charges 'absurd.' 'If I wanted good press, I could have taken the agenda of the left and then I wouldn’t be standing here today.' It is 'absurd that all my life, all my public service has been the total opposite,' Netanyahu continued. The prime minister emphasized that he has waited to testify in court to challenge the accusations against him, but that his responsibilities now as premier take precedence. 'I want to avoid trial? Nonsense! For eight years I've been waiting for this day, to dissolve the baseless accusations. There was no crime, so they searched for a crime.' Outside the court house, Netanyahu's supporters and critics gathered Tuesday, with the former criticizing the judiciary, accusing it of conducting a putsch against the Israeli government, while the latter demanded Israel reach a hostage deal with Hamas.

Iranian leaders ‘punching each other’ over Syria collapse – repor...	Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in disarray after Assad’s stunning defeat in Syria, leaving IRGC leaders to blame each other for ally’s sudden collapse. By World Israel News Staff Iran's leadership is facing an unprecedented crisis following the collapse of Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime, with internal turmoil brewing within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) over the loss of Iranian influence in the region, Britain’s Telegraph reported Monday. Sources close to the situation told The Telegraph that there is growing dissent among IRGC commanders, with accusations flying over their failure to secure Assad's survival despite years of Iranian intervention. For over a decade, Tehran invested billions of dollars in an effort to bolster the Assad regime, viewing his regime as a cornerstone of its regional strategy to maintain proximity to Hezbollah and secure its interests near Israel’s border. Yet, the unexpected flight of Assad as rebels neared Damascus has thrown the entire plan into disarray, leaving the IRGC scrambling to understand the full implications of the collapse. An Iranian official described the situation within the IRGC as one of intense frustration, with commanders reportedly at each other's throats, confronting each other with accusations and anger. 'The atmosphere is like something between almost punching each other, punching the walls, yelling at each other and kicking rubbish bins. They are blaming each other, and no one is taking responsibility,' the official was quoted as saying At the center of the storm is Brig. Gen. Esmail Qaani, the head of the Quds Force, who is being blamed for allowing Assad’s military to disintegrate. Although few dare to confront him publicly, an IRGC source has accused Qaani of failing to prevent the unraveling of Iranian interests in Syria. The loss of Syria is seen as a major blow to Iran, which relied on the country as a key supply route to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. With Iranian operatives either killed or fleeing, Tehran now faces a dire situation with no clear path forward. The crisis has also triggered speculation that Qaani may be replaced, especially after his sudden disappearance from public view following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah by Israel in September. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has summoned senior IRGC commanders in recent days to address the deteriorating situation, with heated discussions about how to salvage Iran's remaining influence in the region.

‘Israeli hostages are in grave mortal danger,’ warns President He...	Israel's president hosts emergency discussion on the medical condition of the hostages, amid fears their weakening condition could leave them vulnerable to infection, hypothermia, or starvation during the upcoming winter season. By World Israel News Staff Israeli President Isaac Herzog hosted medical experts and relatives of Israeli captives held hostage in the Gaza Strip at an emergency meeting in the president's residence in Jerusalem Tuesday to address concerns over the hostages physical condition. The event coincided with International Human Rights Day, and marked 431 days since the captives were taken hostage by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip. 'We are marking 431 days of the most unimaginable violations of human rights,' President Herzog said. 'Today, on International Human Rights Day, not a single right has been upheld by the criminal and terrorist organization Hamas.' 'The entire world must cry out with all its might against this heinous organization and its flagrant violations of human rights, as we've clearly heard in the past hour.' During the meeting Tuesday, health officials voiced their concerns over the condition of the remaining hostages, and provided the president with a report outlining estimates on the captives' medical status, along with the risks they face in extended captivity. 'Based on the report presented here, on various sources of information before me, and on the data I continuously receive, it is palpably clear that the hostages are in grave mortal danger,' Herzog warned. 'Everything must be done, by all possible means, to bring them home.' 'Throughout the year, we have explored every avenue to enhance and provide medical aid to those held in the tunnels of Gaza. We engaged countless times with the Red Cross and other entities, attempting to deliver medications and prescriptions, facilitating meetings between the Red Cross and hostage families, and sharing information. But all efforts hit a wall—the wall of Hamas, which prevented any aid from getting through.' President Herzog expressed optimism that a hostage deal can be reached, noting 'renewed' attempts to reach an agreement amid a 'global convergence' on the matter. 'There is now a significant renewed effort underway. I sincerely thank outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump. Their actions have brought about meaningful change.' 'These efforts must advanced as quickly as possible. Silence is often golden, but the effort itself is critically important. Personally, I engage in discussions with global leaders daily on this very issue.' Last month, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum’s health team, headed by epidemiologist and former chairman of Israel’s Association of Public Health Physicians Dr. Hagai Levine, released a report regarding the conditions of the surviving Israeli captives held hostage in the Gaza Strip. The report said that given the duration and conditions the captives have been held in since October 7th, 2023, they have likely lost a significant amount of body mass, potentially as much as half of their pre-invasion weight. As a consequence of their long-term nutritional deficiencies, the report warns, the surviving hostages are likely suffering from 'dangerously low muscle' mass levels, and are now 'highly vulnerable to hypothermia, frostbite, and respiratory infections,' leaving them at elevated risk for a plethora of maladies in the upcoming winter season.

‘Netanyahu did more against terror in a year than the EU did in 7...	Dutch MP meets with Israeli leaders, praises Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his handling of the war against Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran. By World Israel News Staff A Dutch lawmaker lauded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the war against Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran during a visit to Israel this week. MP Geert Wilders, leader of the right-wing Dutch Party for Freedom, met with senior Israeli leaders in Jerusalem Monday, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Isaac Herzog, Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, Defense Minister Israel Katz, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, Energy Minister Eli Cohen and a number of lawmakers. During his visit, Wilders also toured the Samaria region, hosted by Samaria Regional Council chairman Yossi Dagan. During his visit Monday and following his meeting with Netanyahu, Wilders praised Netanyahu, saying the Israeli premier had done more to combat terrorism since October 7th, 2023, than the European Union has in 70 years - referencing the forerunners of the EU, including the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community, established in the 1950s. 'Just spoke to Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu of Israel in Jerusalem and told him that in 1 year -' by crushing Hamas, pulverizing Hezbollah and significantly weakening Iran - he has done more to fight (international) terrorism than the EU has done in the last 70 years!' Wilders tweeted Monday night. A day before his visit, Wilders denounced the International Criminal Court over its efforts to prosecute Netanyahu, arguing that Israel 'deserves our full support for they are also fighting our fight against the evil forces of terror from Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran.' 'If Israel would fall, the West will be next. Losing is no option. Neither is being silent. Support and perseverance is the only way.' A Eurosceptic and critic of Islam, Wilders has called to freeze immigration to the Netherlands from the Third World, tougher anti-terror measures, and for steps to combat Islamic radicalization.

Adam Schiff is sworn into Senate on edition of Maimonides’ Jewish...	Maimonides, also known as Rambam and considered one of history’s preeminent Jewish scholars, wrote the Mishnah Torah in the 12th century as an all-inclusive guide to the system of Jewish law. By Ron Kampeas, JTA Adam Schiff, the freshman Democratic senator from California, is being sworn into office on a 1490 edition of Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah, one of the most revered and prominent codes of Jewish law. Schiff, in a statement ahead of his swearing in on Monday, said the edition, published in the duchy of Milan, now in northern Italy, was 'a monumental legal code and one of the most organized, comprehensive, and influential works of Jewish law.' The edition was published by Gershom ben Mosheh ish Sontsino, a scion of a pioneering Jewish printing family known as Soncino. A publishing house in the family’s name is still active. A spokeswoman for Schiff, until this week a U.S. Representative and a former federal prosecutor, said he chose the volume, held by the Library of Congress, in part because of his concerns about the state of the rule of law as President-elect Donald Trump returns to office. Schiff led one of Trump’s impeachments in the president’s first term and co-chaired the congressional investigation into the deadly Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol riot, which was spurred by Trump’s false claims he won that election. Trump, who has promised 'retribution' against his perceived enemies, said this week Schiff should be jailed. The spokeswoman said that Schiff was also attracted to the volume because of his intellectual curiosity. 'It’s simply his nerdy interest in how old this volume is and how comprehensive it is,' she said. Maimonides, also known as Rambam and considered one of history’s preeminent Jewish scholars, wrote the Mishnah Torah in the 12th century as an all-inclusive guide to the system of Jewish law. Written in Hebrew and divided into 14 volumes, it is a fixture of Jewish houses of study and other educational institutions. Schiff is not the only Jewish elected official who in recent years chose to be sworn into office on volumes that reflect why they got into politics. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, in 2023 was sworn in on a stack of three Hebrew Bibles, including the one that was on the bimah when a gunman massacred 11 Jewish worshipers in a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018.

Palestinian Authority mouthpiece slams ‘white, racist’ Americans ...	Official Palestinian Authority daily repeatedly accuses President-elect Donald Trump of 'racism,' castigates 'white and racist majority' of Americans for backing him in 2024 election. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Palestinian Authority-controlled media outlets have repeatedly castigated not only President-elect Donald Trump before and after his election last month, but have also taken aim at the more than 77.2 million American voters who sent him back to the White House. An analysis of official Palestinian Authority media outlets conducted by Palestinian Media Watch found numerous instances before and after the November election of attacks against both Trump and the United States as a whole, over his election. On November 7th, two days after the election, the PA-controlled daily newspaper Al-Hayat Al-Jadida ran a piece by columnist Omar Hilmi al-Ghoul castigating Trump as 'racist,' and denouncing the 'white and racist majority' of Americans for voting him into office. 'The white and racist majority from among the Evangelists voted for Republican candidate [Trump]. More than this, the president-elect succeeded in penetrating sectors of black and Latino Americans, despite his racism, and they voted for him.' A caricature of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, run by Falestinona, published by the Fatah party's Information and Culture Commission in Lebanon, Nov. 15, 2024. (PMW) On November 3rd, two days before the presidential election, PA television hosted Syrian pundit Tahsin Halabi on its Capital of Capitals program, during which Halabi accused the American public of chauvinism. 'The American public is a chauvinist public,' Halabi said. 'It will not let a woman be president.' Nor were the criticisms of the United States limited to media outlets. On November 15th, Mahmoud al-Habbash, an advisor to PA chairman Mahmoud Abbas, said in an interview published on YouTube that the U.S. was lying about its desire to end the war in Gaza, calling Israel America's 'errand boy.' 'You say that Israel is imposing its will on the U.S. That isn't correct. The truth is that the one who is imposing its will is the U.S. Israel is working as 'an errand boy'&#8230; for the U.S. and for the U.S. administration.' 'It is carrying out the policies of the American administration&#8230; We must not be deceived by the American attempts to mislead world public opinion and present the US as if it is actually interested in stopping the [Gaza] war.' The U.S., al-Habbash continued, is the 'main threat to humanity,' and is to blame 'for the lack of security, peace, and stability in the Middle East region, and the world.'

Jewish family victimized by Assad ‘relieved’ after regime’s downf...	Woman whose grandfather was tortured by Hafez al-Assad's regime said her family is 'very happy' to see the dynasty toppled. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli woman whose grandfather was imprisoned and tortured by the Syrian regime during the 1970s said she is celebrating the downfall of the Assad dynasty. Yaffa Levy, the daughter of a Syrian-born immigrant to Israel, shared how her family's personal story of suffering under Hafez al-Assad with Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. Levy's father, Marco (Mordechai) Khalifa, was born in Syria to a wealthy family. As a teenager, he became a staunch Zionist and helped smuggle Syrian Jews - who were banned from leaving the country - to Israel via the Golan Heights. He spent the majority of his time in Israel, with occasional missions to Lebanon and Syria to aid local Jewish communities in immigrating to Israel. Khalifa was unable to maintain consistent contact with his parents and siblings, who had remained in Syria. At some point in the 1970s, Hafez al-Assad's regime learned of Khalifa's operations and moved to brutally punish the family, in order to discourage other Syrian Jews from Zionist missions. Despite not having any involvement with his son's activities, Khalifa's father was arrested, imprisoned, and tortured. According to Levy, Khalifa only learned of his father's fate after a clandestine visit to his family's home. Levy said that her grandmother relayed that Khalifa needed to leave Syria and return to Israel as soon as possible, telling him that his father was incarcerated and had his 'eyes gouged out' by his Syrian captors. Khalifa obeyed his mother, never again seeing his family or returning to Syria. 'Dad was a Zionist. He returned to Israel, fought in all the wars, both in mandatory service and in the reserves, participated in the liberation of the Western Wall, started a family. He always felt responsible for what happened to his father,' Levy told Ynet. 'It really stayed with him. Along with the longing for his mother and his family who remained in Syria, [the guilt] with him until his last day.' Levy said that it was a 'shame' that her father, who died more than 30 years ago, had not lived to see the regime being toppled. Still, the ouster of Bashar al-Assad does provide a sense of justice to the family, Levy said. 'We are very happy,' said Levy. 'We saw how much pain Dad was in. [The end of the Assad dynasty] is a great relief for us.'

IDF tanks nearing Damascus, 250 weapons sites bombed: Report	Israeli tanks spotted on outskirts of Damascus, as intense bombing campaign of weapons depots continues. By World Israel News Staff Israeli tanks are present on Syrian soil just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Damascus, according to reports from Arabic-language media. According to Al-Mayadeen, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, IDF tanks were seen in Qatana, marking the deepest entry of the Israeli military into Syrian territory in decades. Qatana, a city in southern Syria with a significant Christian and Awalite population, is located to the east of Mount Hermon. The tallest mountain in the region, Israel previously held one side of Mount Hermon, with Syria maintaining partial control of the site. On Sunday, as the Syrian army withdrew from the area, Israel captured the Syrian side of the mountain, gaining full control of Mount Hermon. Following the ouster of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad from power by rebel groups, the IDF crossed into the former Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between Israel and Syria. 'We gave the Israeli army the order to take over these positions to ensure that no hostile force embeds itself right next to the border of Israel,' said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday as he toured the border region. 'This is a temporary defensive position until a suitable arrangement is found,' Netanyahu said. Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that he ordered the military to completely seize the DMZ and bolstered troop presence along the border. The IDF has been engaged in a campaign to destroy 'strategic weapons' in Syria that could potentially be obtained by rebel groups, including 'surface-to-air missiles, air defense systems, surface-to-surface missiles, cruise missiles, long-range rockets, and coast-to-sea missiles,' Katz said in a statement. Since the fall of Damascus on Sunday, the IDF is believed to have bombed at least 250 strategic military sites in Syria, including air force bases, chemical weapons research facilities, and weapons depots. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon stressed that the IDF was taking 'limited and temporary measures' to ensure that the conflict within Syria would not spill over to Israeli territory. 'It is important to emphasize, however, that Israel is not intervening in the ongoing conflict between Syrian armed groups; our actions are solely focused on safeguarding our security,' Danon told the UN Security Council.

Netanyahu: Axis of evil is crumbling, ‘didn’t happen by accident’	We are dismantling the axis of evil. This didn't happen by accident or on its own &#8230; we are determined to change the face of the Middle East.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a rare press conference on Monday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's presence in Syria after the downfall of the Assad regime marked a 'new chapter' and that 'everyone understands the importance of our being on the Golan Heights.' Netanyahu began the press conference by addressing the deaths of four IDF soldiers in southern Lebanon and three in northern Gaza. Netanyahu addressed their families, 'Along with the entire nation, I embrace you from the depths of my heart.' Regarding the overthrow of Assad's regime in Syria, Netanyahu said, 'Yesterday, a new and dramatic chapter began in the history of the Middle East – the fall of the Assad regime. This was a key pillar in Iran's axis of evil, and everything Iran had invested has now crumbled.' Netanyahu said the series of events illustrates the importance of Israel holding on to the Golan Heights. 'Today, everyone recognizes the immense importance of our presence on the Golan Heights, not at its base,' he said. 'We want to see change in Syria, both for our own benefit and for the well-being of the Syrian people,' Netanyahu said. 'We are dismantling the axis of evil. This didn't happen by accident or on its own. As I said to municipal leaders in southern Israel, we are determined to change the face of the Middle East.' Regarding the situation in Gaza, Netanyahu said, 'We are focused on eliminating the remnants of Hamas' military power and its governing capability while ensuring the safe return of all those kidnapped—every last one of them.' Netanyahu dismissed criticism that the goal of 'total victory' in Gaza was unrealistic. 'If we had ended the war prematurely, we would not have eliminated Sinwar and Nasrallah, nor would we have confronted Hezbollah, Syria, or struck Iran. All of this is happening because we insisted on total victory. What they once mocked is now becoming reality.'

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declared on Monday during a Religious Zionist Party meeting that 'it's time to take control of Gaza' and to take 'decisive action' in Judea and Samaria. Smotrich emphasized that time was of the essence to entirely deprive Hamas of its power and influence. 'It's time to take control of Gaza and strip Hamas of its civilian authority, cutting off its lifeline,' he stated. Smotrich pointed out the fall of Assad's regime to rebel forces as inspiration to take swift and decisive action against Hamas. 'We've seen in Syria how regime leaders scatter like rats once they realize they've lost control. The same can happen in Gaza. We're close—we've already made substantial progress. We need to take the next step to achieve a decisive and clear victory,' Smotrich said. The Finance Minister also criticized hostage release deals that would free only a portion of the hostage and not others an said such agreements can compromise Israel's military goals. 'Instead of negotiating partial deals that leave hostages behind, undermine the progress we've made in the war, and reduce our chances of victory, we must push forward. We must stop fearing the unknown and do what is necessary,' he said. Smotrich said that if Israel 'takes the necessary steps,' Hamasa leaders will 'flee like rats' and 'This will bring all the hostages home and remove the threat to Israel once and for all.' Smotrich also described Judea and Samaria as 'Iran's foothold' and called for the elimination of terror cells and increased settlements to maintain security.

Drone from Yemen hits Yavne apartment, IDF considers retaliation ...	The drone originated from Yemen and was thought to have come from the direction of the sea towards Sderot before heading north. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News After a drone from Yemen hit a penthouse in Yavne, central Israel, the military is investigating failures to alert the public or intercept the drone and is considering a retaliation against the Houthis, Ynet reports. The drone originated from Yemen and was thought to have traveled seaward to Sderot and headed north. Although the drone was briefly detected in Ashdod, tracking systems no longer saw it, and therefore, interception was impossible. The IDF is trying to determine how the drone evaded detection systems while finding ways to boost defense systems and retaliate against threats from the Houthis in Yemen. 'The IDF received reports of a suspicious aerial object falling near Yavne. No siren was activated, and the incident is currently under investigation,' the IDF spokesperson said in a statement. A later update said, 'Following the initial report, a UAV, likely launched from Yemen, crashed in the Yavne area. As of now, no injuries have been reported, and no sirens were activated. The incident is under investigation,' the IDF spokesperson's office stated. Etti Avivi, who owned the penthouse, was relieved that no one was hurt and that her 14-year-old dog Humi was safe. 'A drone crashing into my balcony? I have a better chance of winning the lottery,' she joked. 'I was outside when I heard the crash and the loud boom. I never imagined it was my home. My first worry was about Humi, who was alone inside.' She added, 'I never imagined it would happen at my house when I heard the crash and the loud boom.' Neighbors playfully commented, 'Looks like Humi will now be classified as a victim of hostile actions.' 'I'm so relieved Humi is safe. He must have been in the living room. I heard the explosion like everyone else, but it wasn't until the calls started coming in that I realized it was my home. We're fortunate no one was hurt.'

Israeli MK proposes bill to replace ‘West Bank’ with ‘Judea and S...	This follows a similar bill in the US by Republican senator Tom Cotton that would ban the term 'West Bank' in favor of Judea and Samaria in official US documents. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli MK Simcha Rothman proposed a bill that would replace the term 'the West Bank' with 'Judea and Samaria' in legislation and official documents. This follows a similar bill in the US by Republican senator Tom Cotton that would ban the term 'West Bank' in favor of Judea and Samaria in official US documents. 'The West Bank' and 'Judea and Samaria' refer to the area West of the Jordan River that Israel conquered from Jordan during the 1967 war. The bill's preamble states, 'Judea and Samaria are integral parts of the historic homeland of the Jewish people. Some of the most pivotal events in our history took place in these regions.' 'In contrast, the term' West Bank,' which emerged during a period of foreign rule, reflects a colonialist viewpoint that overlooks the profound historical connection of the Jewish people to this land.' The preamble further states that the bill 'aims to regulate the use of the term 'Judea and Samaria' in Israeli law, replacing other terms that refer to the same geographic area. This shift is in line with the broader effort to strengthen Israel's connection to the region and uphold the historical rights of the Jewish people.' Senator Tom Cotton (R-AK) introduced a bill that would ban the term 'West Bank.' Instead, if the bill becomes a law, it would require all official US documents to use the historically accurate term 'Judea and Samaria.' The bill's full name is the Retiring the Egregious Confusion Over the Genuine Name of Israel's Zone of Influence by Necessitating Government of Judea and Samaria (RECOGNIZING Judea and Samaria) Act. 'The Jewish people's legal and historic rights to Judea and Samaria go back thousands of years. The US should stop using the politically charged term West Bank to refer to the biblical heartland of Israel,' Cotton added.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An Israeli source says Israel is carrying out indirect talks with Syrian rebels, Israel National News reported. The source said communication is occurring through the Druze community in Israel and Syria, the Kurdish population, intelligence organizations, and US officials. 'There is someone to speak to on the other side, and messages were passed,' the source said, indicating Israel will continue operations to eliminate weapons held by the Assad regime. The source says the United States fully approves Israel's indirect communication with Syrian rebels. Defense Minister Israel Katz has encouraged the IDF to capture more areas in the buffer zone close to Syria's border with Israel. According to TPS, Israeli security officials are recruiting prominent Israeli Druze leaders to assist in fostering connections with Syrian Druze communities. On Sunday, Maj.-Gen. Shlomi Bender, head of the Israeli army's Intelligence Directorate, met with Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of Israel's Druze community, according to Lt.-Col. Avichay Adraee, spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces in Arabic. 'The head of the Intelligence Directorate and His Eminence Sheikh Tarif discussed recent developments in Syria and their impact on the Druze community,' Adraee tweeted. The initiative follows instructions from Defense Minister Israel Katz, who directed the IDF on Sunday to establish contact with the Syrian Druze and other local communities. There are an estimated 700,000 to 800,000 Druze in Syria, primarily in the southwestern regions near Israel and Jordan. They make up about four percent of Syria's population. Israel's Druze community, numbering around 152,000, traces its ancestry to Jethro, the Biblical figure and father-in-law of Moses. Israeli Druze hold prominent positions in both public and military life, and the deep bond between Jewish and Druze soldiers is often referred to as the 'covenant of blood.' During Israel's War of Independence in 1948, the Druze living in the Galilee and Mount Carmel regions chose to align with the Jewish community. They decided to integrate into Israeli society and have since established themselves across all sectors of public life.

After losing Syria, Iran ponders next steps	Iran is also concerned about the effect that the successful Syrian revolution could have domestically. By Noah Michaeli, TPS The fall of Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria will force Iran to make significant shifts in its military doctrine, analysts told The Press Service of Israel. 'This is going to force the Iranians to make serious compromises in the long run, because they are now more exposed in the region and they are more exposed internationally, and also because of the weakening economic situation and the isolation of the regime,' Dr. Meir Javedanfar, an Iran lecturer at Reichman University, told TPS-IL. 'But in the short run the Iranian regime is going to stick to its guns, it’s going to continue with its militancy towards the State of Israel. But very difficult questions remain for the regime, especially regarding the nuclear program for which it’s going to have to make painful decisions in the near future,' Javedanfar explained. This is because Iran is 'enriching at levels that are close to levels required to make a nuclear bomb,' Javedanfar said. Furthermore, Iran is also concerned about the effect that the successful Syrian revolution could have domestically. 'The regime is worried about the fall of Assad setting a precedent for the people of Iran doing the same,' Javedanfar explained. 'If Syria turns into a democracy then that would be an even more cause of concern for the regime because it would show that in the Middle East you can overthrow an authoritarian regime and replace it with a democracy,'Javedanfar said. According to Ray Zimmt, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), the fall of Assad is part of an overall trend of Iran weakening, as Israel strikes it on its home territory and its proxies crumble one after the other. 'The Assad collapse is the last part of a series of very concerning developments for Iran, after losing Hamas in Gaza and witnessing devastating damage to Hezbollah and the recent Israeli attack on Iran,' Zimmt told TPS-IL. 'All of these developments have raised doubts about Iran’s ability to deter Israel,' he continued. Syria, however, was of particularly great strategic importance to Iran, due to its role as a bridge for delivering weapons and ammunition from Iran to Hezbollah. 'Now, after the collapse of Assad, Iran’s ability to maintain its influence in Syria and to use Syria to provide Hezbollah with weapons and rehabilitate it has been significantly jeopardized,' Zimmt continued. This is especially significant now, as Hezbollah is desperately trying to rehabilitate itself following the destruction of its leadership and much of its weapons capabilities at the hands of Israel. Iran’s Options These developments, however, do not mean that Iran won’t attempt to maintain its influence in Syria. 'We’ve seen reports even today that Iran has tried to establish communication links with rebels in Syria,' Zimmt said, but added that 'there’s no doubt that Iran won’t be capable — at least in the near future — to maintain supply lines in Syria.' 'They can try to find other ways to assist Hezbollah but it won’t be easy due to Israeli determination to stop all weapons deliveries from Iran, and due to the fact that most border corridors are now dominated by the rebels,' Zimmt continued. The Iranian policy vis a vis Israel, according to Zimmt, can be divided into four main pillars: Proxies, terrorism, missiles and drones, and nuclear. The first three, according to Zimmt, have been used heavily in the past year of war, but were not sufficient to deter Israel from acting against Iran and its proxies. This, according Zimmt, leaves the nuclear pillar as the only pillar left for Iran. 'There are more and more voices inside Iran calling to readapt the nuclear doctrine, saying it’s no longer sufficient to be satisfied with Iran’s position as a threshold state and that it should break out to nuclear,' Zimmt said. But with President-elect Donald Trump due to return to the White House, any Iranian nuclear breakout strategy is very risky for Tehran. 'Currently there is no good option for Iran,' Zimmt explained. 'It’s either to try to look for some sort of arrangement with the west concerning its nuclear program, or to go nuclear but take the risk of further escalation and even military confrontation with Israel.'

Paraguay to make history as sixth nation with Jerusalem embassy	Paraguay has long maintained deep ties with Israel, tracing back to when it voted in favor to establish the Jewish state at the UN in 1947. By Jewish Breaking News Paraguay is set to become the sixth country with an embassy in Jerusalem. In a highly anticipated ceremony this coming Wednesday, President Santiago Pena will demonstrate his nation’s unwavering support for Israel by restoring their diplomatic mission to its rightful place in the Jewish people’s eternal capital. The two-day diplomatic visit will kick off with Pena addressing the Knesset, where he’ll meet with Israel’s leadership including Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Herzog. On Thursday, he will inaugurate his country’s embassy in Har Hotzvim industrial park. Families of victims from the October 7 Hamas massacre are expected to be in attendance. Paraguay has long maintained deep ties with Israel, tracing back to when it voted in favor to establish the Jewish state at the UN in 1947. During his own presidential campaign, the South American leader expressed strong support for moving his embassy to Jerusalem. 'The State of Israel recognizes Jerusalem as its capital. The seat of the parliament is in Jerusalem, the president is in Jerusalem. So who are we to question where they establish their own capital?' Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, who recently inaugurated Israel’s embassy in Asunción, praised Paraguay’s steadfast support. 'About three months ago, I had the honor of inaugurating the Israeli embassy in Paraguay,' Ohana said in comments cited by Hebrew media. 'In a moving ceremony, we affixed the mezuzah from the house where Sivan Elkabetz and Naor Hasidim were murdered on October 7.' 'Paraguay’s president will inaugurate the embassy in Jerusalem. Shimon, Sivan’s father; Avi, Naor’s father; and Elhanan Danino—the father of Uri, who was kidnapped from the Nova party and was murdered—will attend,' he said. 'Avi and Elhanan joined me on my recent visit to Paraguay, and like me, they felt the president’s embracing and sympathetic attitude towards the State of Israel and support for its existential struggle.' While most countries still maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv, Paraguay’s courage in recognition paves the way for more countries to follow. Currently, only the United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Kosovo, and Papua New Guinea have embassies in Jerusalem.

Geert Wilders tours Samaria with regional council head	Wilders is scheduled to meet with President Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, Energy Minister Eli Cohen, Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana and other lawmakers. By JNS Geert Wilders, the head of the Party for Freedom, the Netherlands’ largest political faction and a member of the ruling coalition, visited Samaria on Monday morning at the invitation of the Samaria Regional Council. Council head Yossi Dagan said that Wilders, as part of his tour of the area, received a briefing at an observation point 'in the seam line area on the narrow ‘waist’ of the State of Israel, which illustrates the security importance of Samaria for the residents of the center of the country.' Dagan told the visiting political leader: 'There are only 70 kilometers [44 miles] from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River, with the hills of Samaria dominating the area, accounting for 55 kilometers, [or 34 miles, of those 70 kilometers].' Wilders responded by acknowledging that this is a 'very small area,' adding, 'Not everyone will understand this, but I do.' מנהיג המפלגה הגדולה בהולנד, חירט וילדרס, הגיע לביקור נדיר בישראל, אשר עורר סערה בהולנד, סביב ביקור ביו'ש והמפגש עם יוסי דגן ראש מועצת שומרון. קודם לפגישותיו עם ראש הממשלה ונשיא המדינה, אירח אותו דגן לתצפית על המותניים הצרות של המדינה. pic.twitter.com/y37TBS4UrQ &mdash; שיראל ללום נהיר (@shirellaloom) December 9, 2024 The Dutch politician arrived in the Jewish state on Sunday for a 36-hour visit. After he touched down at Ben-Gurion International Airport on Sunday night, Wilders met with Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology Gila Gamliel 'and other dear friends' in Tel Aviv, he said on social media. Wilders said he was 'proud and privileged' to return to Israel after more than seven years, 'meet their leaders and politicians and visit beautiful Judea and Samaria where I used to live for some time in the ’80s.' Later on Monday, Wilders is scheduled to meet with President Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, Energy Minister Eli Cohen, Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana and other lawmakers, according to the Dutch MP. Last month, Wilders said that he would be pursuing police action after his travel plans to Israel were leaked to the media, allegedly by Dutch civil servants, which reportedly led to the postponement of his visit. 'Today, I spoke with the Internal Investigations Department [of the Dutch police]. I will be filing a report because of the leak of my itinerary in Israel,' Wilders said. According to him, the NRC daily reported on the confidential plan 'shortly after our embassy in Israel was informed.' 'This endangers my safety, as well as that of my security guards. Totally unacceptable,' the Dutch leader concluded his statement. Wilders has lived under strict 24/7 police protection since 2004 after receiving death threats over his criticism of Islamic terrorists and extremists. NRC claimed that the meeting between Wilders and Dagan would run counter to the policies of Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp, a member of the junior coalition partner New Social Contract Party. He supports the creation of a Palestinian state in Judea, Samaria and Gaza. Veldkamp was scheduled to fly to Jerusalem for an official visit last month, but Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar canceled it due to the Dutch diplomat’s support for the International Criminal Court arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Wilders—a staunch supporter of Israel’s right to the entire Land of Israel from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea—resided in the Jewish state for two years during his youth and has reportedly visited the country more than 40 times. After he graduated from secondary school, he spent a year as a volunteer at Moshav Tomer in the Jordan Valley. In 2018, Wilders declared, 'The more Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria the better, for that land is Jewish—and Jordan is Palestine!' Following Wilders’s win in the 2023 Dutch general election, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority condemned him for saying Arabs should be offered the right to settle in Jordan and elect their government. Hamas, which the European Union has listed as a terrorist organization, accused him of making a 'fascist statement that violates international law,' and called on the United Nations to condemn his positions. 'Hamas complaining about international law,' Wilders mockingly responded in a post on X, ending with a clown emoji.

‘Not a Pretty Day’ – Trump envoy warns Hamas of consequences if I...	‘You heard what Trump said,’ says president-elect’s designated Middle East envoy, expressing optimism a deal will be brokered between Hamas and Israel before Trump enters office on January 20th. By World Israel News Staff President-elect Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East tasked with securing the release of the 100 Israeli hostages still held in captivity in the Gaza Strip warned the Hamas terror organization Monday it would face consequences if the captives are not released or a hostage deal secured by inauguration day on January 20th. Speaking during a bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi on Monday, businessman Steve Witkoff, whom Trump has tapped to serve as his special envoy to the Mideast following his inauguration next month, expressed optimism that a deal could be brokered between Israel and Hamas by the January 20th deadline, adding he was hoping and praying an agreement is reached. If a deal is not reached, however, and Hamas continues to hold the hostages captive, Witkoff warned of serious consequences for the Islamist terror group. 'You heard what the president said, they better be released,' Witkoff told Reuters. 'Listen to what the president has got to say. It's not a pretty day if they're not released.' Last week, Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that there would be 'hell to pay' if Hamas continues to hold the 100 remaining Israeli hostages past inauguration day. Earlier on Monday, the London-based, Qatari-owned Al Araby Al Jadeed outlet reported that major progress has been made towards a hostage deal, adding that Hamas has drafted a list of hostages to be released in a possible deal, and submitted the list to Egypt. The Israeli government downplayed the report, however, with the government coordinator for hostage talks issuing a statement to the captives’ families, calling the report 'not correct.' 'We continue to take all measures to secure the return of the hostages and take great care to keep this information secured. We urge you to continue to only rely on information coming from authorized sources.' the statement said.

Anti-Netanyahu vandal directed by Iranian agents, say police	Israeli man from Galilee arrested after torching car, spray painting graffiti against the Netanyahu government - all on behalf of the Iranian government. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli man living in the Galilee was arrested recently, on suspicion he was a paid agent of the Iranian government, authorities announced Monday morning. In a joint statement issued by the Shin Bet internal security agency and the Northern District Police, authorities announced that 33-year-old Israeli citizen Artyom Zolotarev, a resident of Nof HaGalil, was arrested in November on suspicion of carrying out security-related offenses on behalf of Iranian intelligence in exchange for thousands of dollars. The investigation revealed that Zolotarev engaged in activities such as spray-painting anti-government graffiti in Nof HaGalil, Haifa, and Migdal HaEmek, and setting a vehicle on fire in Haifa. These acts were allegedly coordinated and directed by an Iranian handler, referred to online as 'Eliad.' According to Shin Bet and police findings, Zolotarev was contacted by 'Eliad' via social media in October 2024. The handler offered him payment to spray anti-government graffiti with the purported aim of destabilizing Israeli society. Zolotarev carried out dozens of graffiti incidents, documented them through photos and videos, and sent the evidence to 'Eliad' before erasing the graffiti to avoid detection. In return, he was paid $2,800 in cryptocurrency. After refusing additional tasks, including photographing residential buildings, electrical transformers, and burning another vehicle, Zolotarev reportedly realized he was dealing with an Iranian intelligence operative. This realization followed his exposure to reports about other Israeli citizens who had been arrested for similar collaborations with Iranian agents. Despite his initial refusals, Zolotarev later agreed to set a car on fire in Haifa at the request of his handler, receiving $2,000 in cryptocurrency for the act. Subsequently, 'Eliad' introduced Zolotarev to another Iranian handler, 'Boaz Mar,' for whom he continued performing graffiti-related tasks and committed additional acts of arson. Zolotarev was offered $125,000 to carry out a murder, with promises of assistance to flee to Russia or Iran. He was also instructed to purchase a firearm for future use. He declined both offers. This morning, December 9, 2024, a severe indictment was filed against Zolotarev at the Nazareth District Court, charging him with offenses including contact with a foreign agent, arson, and vandalism.

Four IDF soldiers killed in Lebanon, bringing military death toll...	Israeli forces have killed some two dozen Hezbollah terrorists since the start of the Nov. 27 Israel-Lebanon ceasefire. By JNS Four Israel Defense Forces soldier were killed in Southern Lebanon despite the ceasefire currently in effect, the military announced on Monday. The slain troops were identified as Maj. (res.) Evgeny Zinershain, 43, from Zichron Ya’akov; Capt. (res.) Sagi Ya’akov Rubinshtein, 31, from Lavi; Master Sgt. (res.) Binyamin Destaw Negose, 28, from Beit Shemesh; and Sgt. Maj. (res.) Erez Ben Efraim, 25, from Ramat Gan. All four served in Battalion 9263 of the 226th Brigade, the IDF said. Israeli forces have killed some two dozen Hezbollah terrorists since the start of the Nov. 27 Israel-Lebanon ceasefire, the Israel Defense Forces announced on Sunday. The Israeli Air Force has also struck dozens of Hezbollah positions during the same period, the military stated. Under the terms of the truce, Israeli forces are to withdraw from Lebanon by late January, while Lebanon’s army enters those areas vacated by the IDF. Hezbollah has violated the ceasefire repeatedly since the day it took effect, according to the IDF. The IDF said on Sunday that forces of its 7th Armored Brigade, working under the command of the 98th Division, discovered weapons warehouses hidden in civilian areas of Southern Lebanon. In one operation, troops found 'hundreds' of anti-tank rockets, mortar grenades and a car with a rocket launcher mounted on top, the military said, adding that the forces also 'located and destroyed' several tunnel shafts that led to underground Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure. The Israel Defense Forces on Saturday night announced the death in Gaza of Cpt. Avraham Ben Pinchas, 24, a platoon commander in the 401st Armored Brigade’s 46th Battalion, from Harasha in Samaria. According to a preliminary probe, his tank was hit by a Hamas missile during a counter-terror operation in Rafah city. The death toll among Israeli troops since the start of the Gaza ground incursion on Oct. 27 currently stands at 381, and at 813 on all fronts since the Hamas-led massacre on Oct. 7, 2023, according to official IDF data. Additionally, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage-rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Fearing new hostile regime, Iran attempts to woo Syrian rebels	Tehran opens direct line of communication with Syria's new leadership - amid fears the Islamist-led rebels who toppled the pro-Iranian Assad regime could take a 'hostile trajectory' vis-a-vis Iran. By World Israel News Staff Tehran has opened a direct line of communication with Syrian rebel forces who seized control of the capital city of Damascus on Sunday, a senior Iranian official informed Reuters Monday, in an attempt to improve ties with insurgents Iran has hitherto sought to crush. Prior to the fall of Damascus and the collapse of the Assad regime, Iran had worked alongside Russia to bolster the Ba'athist government in Syria, providing not only weapons but also organizing militias to help combat rebel forces across the country. Now, however, Iran has made an about-face, the official said, and is attempting to achieve a rapprochement with its former enemies, including Sunni fundamentalists, who make up a large portion of the rebel forces. The rebel alliance which succeeded in overrunning Damascus was headed by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Sunni group formerly associated with Al Qaeda which has been accused in the past of targeted bombings against Shi'ite pilgrims in Syria. Iran is attempting, the official said, to 'prevent hostile trajectory' between Tehran and the new regime in Damascus. Despite their difficult mutual history, Iran's Foreign Ministry expressed optimism Sunday that relations between Iran and Syria could continue to be based on a 'far-sighted and wise approach,' even after the change in regime. Senior Iranian officials have yet to panic over the loss of their long-time ally, ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad, with three different Iranian officials saying their government is working to find elements within the new Syrian leadership 'whose views are closer to Iran's.' 'The main concern for Iran is whether Assad's successor will push Syria away from Tehran's orbit,' one Iranian official said. 'That is a scenario Iran is keen to avoid.'

‘Israel must reorganize presence on Golan Heights’	The Pereh unit will consist of highly trained reservists, described as reconnaissance and special unit members, who are locals. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS As part of its efforts to implement lessons drawn from Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of southern Israel, the Israel Defense Forces recently announced the establishment of a rapid-response reserve unit for the Golan Heights. These lessons remain relevant no matter whom Israel finds itself facing on the other side of the border in the wake of the Assad regime’s collapse. On Dec. 3, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit announced the inauguration of the Pereh (Hebrew for 'Wild') unit in the Golan Heights, which will operate under the Golan Division (formally known as the 210th 'Bashan' Formation). The new unit was established as part of the process of improving the operational response in the Golan Heights, with an emphasis on creating a division-level force multiplier. The unit will consist of highly trained reservists, described as reconnaissance and special unit members who are locals. Brig. Gen. Yair Palai, commander of the 210th Formation, said the Pereh Unit was born out of a need for the Golan Heights to grow stronger and deal with any challenge. The unit’s commander, identified only as Lt. Col. (res.) Y., added that enlisted personnel joined the unit over the past three months. Brig. Gen. (res.) Yossi Kuperwasser, a senior research fellow at Misgav Institute for National Security, and former head of the Research and Assessment Division of the IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate, told JNS on Dec. 7 that 'the logic standing behind the establishment of the Pereh Unit is to enable significant improvement of the area defense in the Golan Heights, on the basis of quality reserve personnel residing in the region, and this under the area division [Division 210].' According to Kuperwasser, 'This is part of the drawing of lessons from the October 7 attack, during which there was a significant shortage of skilled fighters mainly in the first hours, and the transition from routine to emergency was very problematic.' Kuperwasser added, 'The latest developments in Syria sharpen even more so the importance of the establishment of the unit, because they teach how much the aspects of the threat can change rapidly. It seems as if there is a need to set up similar units along the other borders, as part of the needed change in the security concept, and for improving the defense component.' Thwart every threat On Dec. 6, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit stated that in light of an assessment of the situation that has been taking place since the previous day at the General Staff and in the Northern Command, and 'in light of the developments in the internal fighting in Syria, it was decided on reinforcement of air and ground forces in the Golan Heights sector. 'IDF forces are deployed in the border area and have increased readiness according to the various scenarios,' the military said. The army vowed that it would 'not allow a threat close to Israel’s border, and would act to thwart every threat on the citizens of the State of Israel.' Lt. Col. (res.) Doron Avital, a former commander of the elite General Staff Reconnaissance Unit (Sayeret Matkal), told JNS on Dec. 6 that changes in Syria demanded new organizational responses. 'In light of the developments in the north—the civil war in Syria—it is clear that one must organize in a different and more effective way along the Golan Heights line,' Avital said. He assessed that 'the Lebanon and Syria arenas are interwoven together—here, the weakening of Hezbollah is immediately translated into strengthening of the rebels [in Syria] and the axis opposing Iran.' According to Avital, 'In light of this, to build forces and units that have intimate regional familiarity—topographical landscape—regional familiarity with the enemy—is a good idea,' adding that the Golan Division’s Alpinist Unit along the Hermon line and Mount Dov operate on this basis, and that a unit should do the same within the greater Golan Heights area. Last month, the IDF confirmed that it is constructing new fortifications on the Golan Heights, on the border with Syria. According to the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit, Israel has been 'working to establish a barrier on Israeli territory exclusively to thwart a possible terrorist invasion and protect the security of Israel’s borders.' The most disturbing scenario involves a surprise attack by Iranian-backed Shi’ite terrorist militias on Israeli communities and IDF bases in the Israeli Golan Heights, similar to the Oct. 7, 2023, assault and to what Hezbollah had planned to do in the Galilee from Lebanon. Thousands of enemy operatives could attempt to infiltrate Israeli territory using fast vehicles, breach the border and kill civilians.

Israel reaching out to Syrian Druze communities	An estimated 700,000-800,000 Druze live in Syria, mostly in southwestern areas near Israel and Jordan. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Israeli security officials are enlisting senior Israeli Druze figures to help build bridges with Syrian Druze communities. The head of the Israeli army’s Intelligence Directorate, Maj.-Gen. Shlomi Bender, met with Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of Israel’s Druze community on Sunday, according to Lt.- Col. Avichay Adraee, the Israel Defense Force’s Arabic spokesperson. 'The head of the Intelligence Service and His Eminence Sheikh Tarif discussed the developments in the scene in Syria and their effects on the Druze community,' Adraee tweeted. The move came as Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the IDF to establish contact with the Syrian Druze and other communities on Sunday. An estimated 700,000-800,000 Druze live in Syria, mostly in southwestern areas near Israel and Jordan. They make up around four percent of the Syrian population. Israel’s Druze community of 152,000 trace their ancestry back to the Biblical figure Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses. Israeli Druze serve in senior positions in public and military life, and the bond between Jewish and Druze soldiers is referred to as the 'covenant of blood.' The Druze speak Arabic but are not Muslim and are very secretive about their religious beliefs. The Druze living in the Galilee and Mount Carmel areas sided with the Jews in 1948 during Israel’s War of Independence, opted to be part of Israeli society and established themselves in all areas of public life. When Israel captured the Golan Heights during the Six-Day War of 1967, the Golan Druze refused Israeli offers of citizenship, believing Syria would recapture the plateau. But attitudes have changed since the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2011. Katz also ordered the army to prevent Iran and Hezbollah from renewing arms smuggling routes between Syria and Lebanon and to destroy strategic weapons that could fall into rebel hands. Israel took control of the 235 sq km buffer zone –including the Syrian side of Mt. Hermon, a strategic peak in the Golan Heights — to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border as the regime of Bashar Assad collapsed on Sunday. The move into the demilitarized zone was coordinated with peacekeepers from the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, which has been monitoring an Israeli-Syrian ceasefire since 1974. The Israeli Air Force struck military airfields, weapons depots and munitions factories across southern Syria and around Damascus to prevent them from falling into rebel hands. Targets included the Mezzeh and Khalkalah military airports in the Damascus area, which were used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and Hezbollah. The strikes also reportedly destroyed facilities producing chemical weapons and precision missiles.

The Qatar Foundation’s hidden hand, from Hamas to US universities	An ISGAP report labeled Qatar as the largest foreign donor to US universities. By TPS As Qatar resumed mediating an Israel-Hamas hostage deal, the Gulf state has also been using its economic power to support Hamas terror and spread propaganda on North American campuses. One key figure in this effort is Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, the mother of current Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. 'She is a fashion icon and a philanthropist, but she is openly pro-Hamas,' Asaf Romirowsky, historian and executive director of Scholars for Peace in the Middle East community, told The Press Service of Israel. Through the Qatar Foundation, which Moza heads, Qatari money is flooding American schools and universities to indoctrinate American students. A 2022 study by the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) argued that as funding from Middle Eastern countries increases and becomes less transparent, campuses experience an 'erosion of democratic values.' Another ISGAP report labeled Qatar as the largest foreign donor to US universities. 'Our investigations during the Trump administration revealed that many of the US most prestigious universities are shockingly agnostic about who they’ll take money from,' Paul R. Moore, former chief investigative counsel in the US Department of Education, told TPS-IL. 'The purposes of these donors are often very much contrary to the US national interests. The failure of many of the universities to respond to antisemitic protests is a perfect example. The universities didn’t want to offend their Middle Eastern donors.' Romirowsky and Moore agreed that President-elect Donald Trump will demand greater transparency from universities about their foreign funding. 'Qatar money is tunneling anti-American values into America, buying hearts and minds. This needs to be changed,' Romirowsky said. Added Moore, 'I fully expect that the incoming Trump administration will quickly reverse the current administration’s negligence of its enforcement obligations. Civil investigations are very likely to occur with universities that have failed to be in compliance.' After Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in October, Moza eulogized the mastermind of the October 7 attacks. 'The name Yahya means the one who lives. They thought he was dead but he lives. He will live on and they [Israel] will be gone,' she tweeted. In a recent article in the Jewish Journal, Moza was called a matriarch of the royal family, 'heavily involved in the dispersing of funds,' according to Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president of research for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). According to the FDD, Qatar has given an estimated $1.8 billion to Gaza’s Hamas-run government since 2007, with reports indicating that around 80 percent of that money was paid as salaries to Hamas terrorists and leaders.

‘State of Optimism’ – Hamas drafts list of living captives to be ...	Hostage deal talks are making progress and have moved to 'advanced stage,' report claims, to the point where Hamas has handed over a list of captives to be released in a possible deal - and a list of jailed terrorists it is demanding be freed in exchange. By World Israel News Staff Hostage deal talks have made significant process recently, reaching an 'advanced stage,' according to a report Monday by the London-based, Qatari-owned news outlet Al Araby Al Jadeed. Citing a source familiar with the issue, the report claimed that talks between Hamas and Israel, brokered by Qatar and Egypt, have reached a point where the two sides are now discussing the individuals who will be released in a possible deal. Hamas reportedly has drafted a tentative list of living hostages who could be released in an agreement, including information on their condition. The deal now under consideration would include the release of elderly captives and female captives, along with others whose health is in serious condition. The hostages listed for release in the deal include four with American citizenship, despite not fitting the demographic criteria. The terror group has transmitted the list to Egyptian brokers, who according to Monday's report, are in a 'state of optimism' regarding the prospects for a deal by the January 20th deadline laid out by President-elect Donald Trump. Hamas has also drafted a list of jailed Arab terrorists it wants released from Israeli prisons in exchange for the freeing of Israeli captives.

Israeli defense minister consolidates IDF control over Syrian Gol...	Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar insists IDF's new security zone on Syrian side of the Golan Heights is 'limited, temporary,' and intended only to prevent incursions from the Syrian side. By World Israel News Staff Israel's military has been ordered to establish a security zone on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, consolidating Israeli control over the area, after rebels - led by an Islamist faction - seized control of the government over the weekend. According to Hebrew media reports Monday, Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) has instructed the IDF to deepen Israeli control over the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, after Israeli tanks and soldiers moved into the strategic area Sunday morning. Shortly after rebel forces, led by the radical Islamist Tahrir al-Sham movement, captured Damascus and forced President Bashar Assad to flee, Israeli forces crossed the demarcation line separating the Israeli and Syrian sides of the Golan Heights, taking control of the buffer zone established after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Israel directly controls 500 square miles of the strategic plateau it captured in 1967, which the Knesset annexed in 1981 - a move which decades later was recognized by the United States. Syria has controlled the remaining 200 square miles since a series of separation of forces agreements after the 1973 war, with 91 square miles included in a demilitarized zone, where no military forces were permitted, and a United Nations observer force was deployed. On Sunday, Israeli forces were deployed to the demilitarized zone, and additionally seized control of parts of the Syrian Golan outside of the DMZ, including the Syrian side of Mount Hermon. Katz reportedly ordered all areas of the Syrian Golan Heights placed under Israeli control to be turned into a security zone, which IDF forces would ensure will remain free of hostile forces, terrorist infrastructure, and Iranian weapons smuggling. Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa'ar (New Hope) said at a press conference Monday that Israel's presence in the Syrian Golan is 'limited' and 'temporary.' 'The only interest we have is the security of Israel,' Sa'ar emphasized.
