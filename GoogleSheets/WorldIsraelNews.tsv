Hezbollah rockets wound three in northern Israel	The IDF also reported on Wednesday morning that three drones had crossed from Lebanon into the Western Galilee, all of which were intercepted By JNS Three Israelis were wounded in Hezbollah attacks on northern Israel on Wednesday, according to medics. A 70-year-old man was lightly wounded when rocket shrapnel hit his car in the Upper Galilee, the Magen David Adom emergency service said. The victim suffered a minor head wound and was evacuated to Ziv Hospital in Safed. Earlier, two farmers were wounded, including one seriously, when a Hezbollah rocket struck an agricultural field near the evacuated Israeli border town of Metula. The other victim was lightly wounded. The two were transported by helicopter to Rambam Medical Center in Haifa for treatment. On Wednesday morning, the Iranian-backed terror army launched a missile that triggered sirens as far south as Netanya. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the missile broke up in the air. The IDF also reported on Wednesday morning that three drones had crossed from Lebanon into the Western Galilee, all of which were intercepted. Israel Fire and Rescue services were operating to extinguish a blaze ignited in the area of Gesher HaZiv. No injuries were reported in the incidents. Additionally, a drone strike early Wednesday in Nahariya caused minor damage to an aerospace component facility. The IDF was investigating why alarms weren’t triggered by the attack. The IDF said that as of 3 p.m. local time on Wednesday, 50 projectiles had been fired into Israel by Hezbollah. On Tuesday, one person was killed by a Hezbollah rocket in the northern Israeli town of Ma’alot Tarshiha. Israeli media identified the fatality as Mohammad Naim, 24. Also on Tuesday, a Hezbollah drone detonated over a pedestrian bridge in Nahariya in northwestern Israel. No injuries were reported. Israeli Air Force eliminates Radwan commander The IDF announced on Wednesday that Mustafa Ahmad Shakhadi, deputy commander of Hezbollah’s Radwan Force, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike near Nabatieh in Southern Lebanon.

Shakhadi in his previous roles was responsible for Radwan operations during the Syria conflict from 2012 to 2017, and also managed the unit’s combat operations in Southern Lebanon. 'The Radwan Force is Hezbollah’s elite unit, aimed at infiltrating Israeli territory and capturing areas near the northern border,' the military said. 'The IDF will continue to act against Hezbollah terrorists and commanders and to thwart any threat facing Israeli citizens.' IDF issues evacuation orders for Baalbek Residents of Baalbek were reportedly rushing to flee the city, located east of the Litani River in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, following evacuation orders issued by Israel’s military. The IDF was urging civilians in Baalbek and surrounding villages to leave immediately, warning that it was preparing attacks on Hezbollah targets. Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, head of the Arab Media Branch in the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit, tweeted that 'the [Israeli army] will act forcefully against Hezbollah interests within your city and villages.' Evacuation instructions were included in the post and a map was displayed with the evacuation routes. #عاجل إنذار عاجل إلى سكان بعلبك وعين بورضاي ودورسجيش الدفاع سيعمل بقوة ضد مصالح حزب الله داخل مدينتكم وقراكم ولا ينوي المساس بكم.من أجل سلامتكم عليكم اخلاء منازلكم فورًا والانتقال خارج المدينة والقرى عبر المحاور التالية: أوتوستراد زحلة - بعلبكطريق نحلة - بعلبك طريق… pic.twitter.com/1FZoFWqdeO &mdash; افيخاي ادرعي (@AvichayAdraee) October 30, 2024 AFP reported that the main roads out of the city were packed with vehicles, with civil defense vehicles driving around urging civilians to leave immediately. About an hour after the evacuation orders, the city was nearly empty.

PM’s spokesman leaked sensitive intelligence during Iran attack	Dr. Omer Dostri committed a 'serious breach of information security procedures,' a security official said. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leaked sensitive intelligence on the IDF’s aerial attack on Iran while it was ongoing Friday night, Channel 11 reported Tuesday. Dr. Omer Dostri, who came into his position in the Prime Minister’s Office in August, 'publicized footage and revealed details' that constituted 'a serious breach of information security procedures,' said reporter Suleiman Maswadeh. The documentation, a recording of persons involved in the attack, was supposed to first be reviewed by the security authorities so that elements could be blurred and any other necessary changes made. Formal approval of publication also had to be obtained before its release. Neither of these steps were taken, said the reporter, and the clip was publicized widely both by the Israeli and international media. 'Publishing this documentation caused great commotion among the security bodies that were supposed to be responsible for it,' Maswadeh noted. One official told the station that what Dostri did was 'an extremely serious breach' of procedure. The Prime Minister’s Office has yet to respond to a request for comment on the offense. The daring weekend attack in response to Iran's second launch of missiles on Israel saw three waves of IDF jets destroy facilities in Iranian military bases that produced vital ballistic missile components and mixed solid fuel for the missiles, as well as demolishing advanced equipment that it could not manufacture independently. A Saudi Arabian news site, Elaph, cited a source saying that it would take two years for Tehran to rebuild the factory that contained many heavy fuel mixers. The operation also took out many radar systems and most of Iran’s advanced air defenses, including its powerful S-300 systems imported from Russia. Three had remained after the IDF took out one in April in a pinpoint response to Iran’s first attack on Israel with 300 missiles and drones, almost all of which were shot down by the IDF and allies such as the U.S., Great Britain and even Jordan. These guarded a large gas field and the country’s most important petrochemical production complex, as well as Tehran’s international airport, a vital port and a missile base. A Fox News report Tuesday cited U.S. Special Envoy for the Middle East Amos Hochstein as saying on an internal call, 'Iran is essentially naked' now, as it cannot defend itself from an advanced airstrike. Israel therefore has freedom of action in the skies above its biggest strategic enemy, a message made clear by IDF Chief of Staff Lieut. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who warned Iran not to respond because Israel 'know[s] how to strike' and has capabilities it has not even shown yet. Israel refrained this time from attacking Iran’s economic lifeline, its gas and oil fields and production facilities, or its nuclear sites that constitute a strategic threat to Israel’s existence, reportedly due to massive U.S. pressure. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled it out, however, telling the Knesset plenum at its opening session Monday that 'Stopping the Iranian nuclear program is at the forefront of our minds, and for obvious reasons, I cannot share with you all our plans and actions in this regard.'

Netanyahu may postpone son’s wedding due to security concerns	On October 19, a Hezbollah drone made a direct hit on Netanyahu's vacation home in Caesarea. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering postponing his son Avner's wedding in November because of the serious security situation. The wedding was scheduled for November 26 at the Ronit Farm in the Sharon region, north of Tel Aviv. Although Kan quoted the premier as saying privately that the event could put participants at risk, the Prime Minister's Office has not confirmed these remarks. On Monday, Netanyahu expressed concern about drones, specifically since they fly below the radar of missile detection systems. He said, 'We have good detection and interception systems for missiles.' According to the report, The Prime Minister also asked why the Knesset was meeting in its usual location. On October 19, a Hezbollah drone made a direct hit on Netanyahu's vacation home in Caesarea. Neither the Prime Minister nor his wife, Sara were at home at the time of the attack. Following the attempted assassination, security measures for government ministers and other officials have been 'significantly' reinforced. 'Iran tried to eliminate the prime minister of Israel. It will not escape responsibility,' a senior Israeli government official told Ynet. The attack involved three drones, with two intercepted and one directly hitting the bedroom window at the Prime Minister's Caesarea residence. 'The attempt by Iran's proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake,' the prime minister said in a statement following the incident. 'This will not deter me or the State of Israel from continuing our just war against our enemies in order to secure our future. 'I say to Iran and its proxies in its axis of evil: Anyone who tries to harm Israel's citizens will pay a heavy price,' Netanyahu warned. Prior to the attack, drones were observed surveilling the area of the Prime Minister's vacation home. An unmanned aircraft operated by Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon surveilled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence, according to a report preceding the incident.

US team arriving to negotiate Lebanon ceasefire – report	Possible elements of a deal include a serious supervisory mechanism to ensure Hezbollah compliance and a blockade to prevent the terrorist group from rearming. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration’s two top Middle East advisers are coming to Israel to try to negotiate a ceasefire with Hezbollah, Walla reported Wednesday. Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and present an American proposal that could end the fighting in Lebanon 'within weeks,' the news site said, and allow 60,000 residents of the north to return to their homes after a year in limbo since being evacuated for their own safety. According to Walla, they waited until Netanyahu held an hours-long meeting with senior ministers and the heads of Israel’s security bodies Tuesday night to discuss and decide upon the potential parameters of a deal. Israeli officials told the news site that the fact that McGurk and Hochstein are arriving is a sign that the prime minister is ready to move forward on a diplomatic end to the war. The Jerusalem Post cited Wednesday an Israeli source who said that the IDF would not leave southern Lebanon until there is 'an effective solution' to prevent the terror group from reinstating itself on Israel’s border. Israel has repeatedly declared its demand that the binding UN Security Council’s Resolution 1701 that ended the Second Lebanon War in 2006 must finally be fully implemented. This would push Hezbollah forces beyond the Litani River, which for the most part runs several kilometers beyond Israel’s border. This would at least put an effective end to the threat of anti-tank missiles and short-range rockets being fired into northern communities. It would also prevent the construction of sophisticated tunnel networks for an invasion force and the storage of advanced weaponry in Lebanese villages close to the border, which the IDF has found in abundance in recent weeks and blown up. UNSC 1701 envisioned the Lebanese Army taking over the area, although it is not necessarily a more neutral force, because Hezbollah is known to have infiltrated the country's official armed forces. The Post cited a source who said that the American deal now envisions the UN’s peacekeeping force, UNIFIL, in that space, although over the last 18 years UNIFIL did nothing to prevent the Hezbollah build-up on the border or launching rockets, UAVs and other deadly projectiles at Israel. Ynet reported Wednesday that Israel has asked Germany, France and Britain if they would be willing to beef up or maybe replace the current UNIFIL force, perhaps with the thought that those countries would commit more to its official peacekeeping mandate. According to this report, a deal would begin with a 60-day military lull, when 5-10,000 Lebanese army troops would deploy along Israel’s northern border along with UNIFIL, and Hezbollah retreating beyond the Litani. Some kind of supervisory international mechanism is being negotiated as well to ensure compliance, said the report, with Israel demanding the right to re-enter Lebanon if Hezbollah violates the accord. The last element being discussed is how to prevent Hezbollah from rearming, either by land, sea or air. The report said that Russia has expressed willingness to enforce such an embargo, and that Israeli officials are talking to Moscow about the issue. Walla cited unnamed American and Israeli officials as saying that they believe that after the blows the Iranian terror proxy has suffered over the last two months, Hezbollah is finally ready to pursue its own deal with Jerusalem instead of maintaining its stance that it would only stop its attacks when Hamas arranges a ceasefire with Israel. The extremist Shiite organization has lost several thousand fighters in its yearlong confrontation with the IDF, most importantly its entire senior military command and its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, whom the IDF assassinated earlier this month in his underground Beirut compound. It is not toothless yet by any means, as proven by the loss of some two dozen soldiers in southern Lebanon since the IDF incursion began early this month with dozens more injured, some very seriously. In addition, dozens of missiles are still being fired every day, mostly at the north, with one killing a man in Ma’alot-Tarshiha Tuesday and another killing two in the Arab town of Majd al-Krum Friday. Longer range rockets have also reached deeper into Israel, with the Sharon region being targeted Wednesday morning, and shrapnel from at least one missile falling over Haifa. The terrorists are also launching UAVs nearly every day, with the latest one hitting a factory in Nahariya’s industrial zone overnight Wednesday.

Nikki Haley blasts Biden, Harris for funding UNRWA	Policy over personality' - Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, a frequent critic of Donald Trump, explains her endorsement of her former boss. By World Israel News Staff Former South Carolina Governor and 2024 Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley took aim at President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris Tuesday over the administration's reinstatement of funding for a United Nations aid agency accused of links to Hamas and other Gaza terror groups. Haley, who served as United States Ambassador to the United Nations under Donald Trump, was a frequent critic of the former president during her failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination this year, and declined to explicitly endorse him even after she dropped out of the race on March 6th. During the 2024 Republican National Convention in July, however, Haley offered her 'strong endorsement' of Trump, warning against a Harris presidency. On Tuesday, Haley defended her endorsement of Trump despite her past criticisms of her former boss, telling Fox News it is 'more important to support policy over personality,' castigating the Biden administration's handling of the economy and foreign policy. Haley also took to X/Twitter to condemn the White House's policies, warning that should Kamala Harris be elected next week, the U.S. would face even greater consequences. Among the policies Haley took issue with was the decision by the Biden administration to restore American funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), amid accusations the agency ignored the involvement of some of its employees with terrorist groups including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and claims UNRWA turned a blind eye to the misuse of its funds and facilities. UNRWA has also faced criticism for the anti-Israel and antisemitic incitement in textbooks used by schools operated by the agency. 'We knew long before Oct. 7 that UNRWA spread anti-Israel and antisemitic hate,' Haley wrote. 'That's why the U.S. stopped giving them hundreds of millions of dollars when I was at the UN.' 'Biden-Harris gave the money back, no strings attached. America and Israel will suffer the consequences if Kamala Harris is elected.' In 2018, then-President Donald Trump suspended funding for UNRWA. The U.S. had previously been spending some $360 million annually on the agency, making American UNRWA's largest donor. In 2021, however, just months after taking office, President Biden resumed funding UNRWA to the tune of roughly $150 million per year. Following revelations that some UNRWA employees took part in the invasion of Israel on October 7th and subsequent atrocities, President Biden froze funding for UNRWA, starting in January 2024. Two months later, Congress passed legislation barring direct funding for UNRWA until MArch 2025.

‘A noble life’ – Fallen soldier leaves behind pregnant wife	Yedidia Bloch, 32, is survived by his wife, parents, and seven siblings. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli reservist seriously hurt in battle last week died on Tuesday, leaving behind a wife who is eight months pregnant with their first child. Master Sergeant Yedidia Bloch, a resident of Mevo Horon in the Binyamin region, died of wounds sustained during fighting in southern Lebanon after clinging to life for six days. Bloch, 32, served in the 7155th Battalion. He is survived by his wife, Sapir, parents, seven brothers and sisters, and many nieces and nephews. 'For the past few days we have been praying for our dear friend. He went into battle with great dedication. He fought and died for the people of Israel and for our complete victory,' said Binyamin Regional Council head Israel Ganz. 'At this time, we embrace his wife Sapir, as well as his parents and siblings and send strength to the community of Mevo Horon. Thanks to Yedidia, the people of Israel will overcome and win.' 'Someone asked me today what the name Yedidia means - and it is enough to see the light on your face to feel your friendship. Our beloved nephew and hero, the light of his eyes, the light of his heart,' Yedidia's aunt, Naomi, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'He was a devoted friend, with a big heart and always ready to help others, and a figure admired by all his nephews and nieces,' another family member said. Bloch 'was such a handsome man, blond, tall, with bright eyes. A light-hearted, funny guy and a smiling and happy person, and just as beautiful on the inside' as outside, wrote his friend Omri on Facebook. 'Yedidia Bloch, you are the beautiful Israeli. This is how I will remember you as a man and a dear friend, a man of giving, laughter and true love. I will tell your child about you as soon as he grows up - so that he knows what a special and kind man his father was.'

‘We may need to hit Iran again, including new targets’ – IDF Chie...	The IDF did not launch a no-holds-barred attack on Iran because 'we may be required to do it again,' says IDF chief. By World Israel News Staff Israel may launch an additional strike against Iran, which would include fresh targets not included in the first round of attacks, Israeli army Chief of Staff Herzi HaLevi said on Tuesday. If Tehran 'makes the mistake and launches another barrage of missiles at Israel, we will once again know how to reach Iran,' HaLevi said while touring the Ramon Air Force Base in southern Israel. In the event of continued Iranian aggression, Israel will 'reach Iran, with capabilities that we did not even use this time, and hit extremely hard both the capabilities and the places that we spared this time,' he continued. The IDF chief acknowledged criticism that Saturday's attack - which came after a massive ballistic missile assault on Israel launched by Iran on October 1 - had not sufficiently deterred the Islamic Republic. The military did not launch a no-holds-barred attack on Iran because 'we may be required to do it again,' he said. 'We didn’t finish this event, we are right in the middle of it,' he added. HaLevi's remarks come after reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet discussed plans for a potential second attack on Iran for more than six hours, though ultimately did not come to a decision on the matter. In Saturday's attack, Israel struck missile and drone manufacturing sites, but appeared to cave to heavy pressure from the U.S. to avoid striking Iran's nuclear development program and oil assets. However, cabinet members reportedly said that the attack was a response solely to Iran's ballistic missile attack - and did not constitute a sufficient response to the drone strike on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Caesarea residence earlier in October. Despite public threats by Iranian officials to 'punish' Israel for the recent strike, Israel believes that Tehran is not gearing up for a counter-attack on Israel in the near future.

At ‘emergency session’ on Israel’s attack on Iran, UN Security Co...	The Israeli envoy told the Security Council to impose 'crippling sanctions' on Iran’s military and economic infrastructure. By Mike Wagenheim, JNS Iran will suffer 'severe consequences' if the Islamic Republic continues to attack Israel or U.S. troops across the Middle East, Washington said during a contentious U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday afternoon. The emergency session—which Algeria, China and Russia called—addressed the impact of Israel’s retaliatory attacks on Iranian military targets over the weekend, in response to Tehran’s barrage of some 200 ballistic missiles on Israel earlier in the month. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the global body, told the Security Council that Washington, which doesn’t want to see further escalation, believes 'this should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran.' But the United States 'will not hesitate to act in self-defense,' she said. Iran accused the Biden administration of complicity in Israel’s weekend assault, which reportedly degraded Tehran’s missile production capabilities significantly. Washington has said many times that it played no role in the Israeli operation. Iran 'seeks to gaslight and deflect, to claim the role of victim, while continuing to sow chaos across the region,' Thomas-Greenfield said. She demanded that Tehran 'stop pouring gasoline on the fire of regional conflict.' Danny Danon, the Israeli U.N. ambassador, reminded the council that Jerusalem 'promised' that Iran’s direct attack on Israel—its second in five months—'would not go unanswered.' 'We assured them that we would choose the time and manner of our response, and that it would be painful,' Danon said. 'Those promises are being kept.' Danon stressed that the precise military targeting of the attack on Iran was meant to inflict minimal civilian damage. The Security Council’s 'usual chorus of ‘de-escalation’ is not only weak, but profoundly misguided,' he said and results in 'failure to impose real cost' on the Iranian regime. The Israeli envoy told the Security Council to impose 'crippling sanctions' on Iran’s military and economic infrastructure and issued a 'warning' to Iranian leadership that 'any further aggression will be met with consequences that are swift and decisive.' Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s U.N. ambassador, said that the Islamic Republic has the 'inherent right to respond at a time of its choosing to this act of aggression.' ‘More fuel on the flames’ Iravani stated that the Oct. 1 attack on Israel was retaliation for the assassinations of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps general Abbas Nilforoushan in Beirut, as well as Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Hezbollah and Hamas are among Iran’s terrorist proxies, receiving training and funding from Tehran. Iravani called Israel’s assassinations of terror leaders 'part of a broader, sustained pattern of aggression and unchecked impunity with which Israel continues to destabilize the entire region.' Much of the rest of the Security Council was split along traditional fault lines. Barbara Woodward, the United Kingdom’s U.N. envoy, called for Iran to stand down, saying 'all sides must exercise restraint. No good can come of pouring more fuel on the flames of this escalating cycle of violence.' Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian U.N. ambassador, took shots at both Israel and the United States. 'Jerusalem is not ready to give up on its choice to resolve all of its conflict situations with neighbors exclusively by force,' Nebenzia said, claiming that Israel’s 'determination to act that way' is due to 'the support and cover from American allies.' Fu Cong, China’s U.N. ambassador, told the United States 'to put saving lives and preventing war' first, by backing the calls of other Security Council members for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and ramping down fighting between Israel and Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border. Abbas Kadhim Obaid, the Iraqi envoy to the United Nations, condemned Israel’s unauthorized use of Iraqi airspace to strike Iran. Baghdad sent a missive earlier in the day to the Security Council complaining about what it said was a violation of its sovereignty. The Security Council will meet again on Tuesday for its quarterly open debate on the Israeli-Palestinian file.

Mandela’s pro-Hamas grandson rages after UK visa denied	Mandla Mandela's presence in the UK would pose a threat to Jewish communities, society, says UK border ministry. By World Israel News Staff Nelson Mandela's grandson, who has repeatedly praised Hamas and Hezbollah, posted an angry tirade on his Instagram account after he was denied a visa to travel to the UK due to his support for terrorism. Mandla Mandela was slated to speak at several pro-Palestinian rallies in cities throughout the UK, including Manchester, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. But the UK Home Office denied a visa to Mandela, explaining in a letter that the decision was due to his pro-terror posts on Instagram. The letter highlighted several posts lauding Hamas made by Mandela on the account. 'Your presence in the UK is considered to pose a threat to UK society as it would highly likely cause tensions amongst UK Jewish communities,' the Home Office said. It is in the interests of the community to refuse your visa to protect public safety and prevent disorder or crime in the UK.' An enraged Mandela took to his Instagram account, claiming that the UK government is guilty of 'duplicity and support for, and complicity with genocide Israel.' Mandela then conflated the anti-Israel movement, which has seen Jews verbally and physically assaulted on college campuses and city streets, to the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. 'We will not be silenced. The denial of visa is an infringement of my movement and an attempt to undermine the work of the Anti-Apartheid Movement in the UK,' he wrote, alleging that the decision was indicative of the 'colonial mentality that seeks to deny us our right of free movement, association and speech.' He then compared himself to his grandfather, who is widely viewed as a hero in South Africa for his critical role in overturning the apartehid system in the country. Mandela said he carries 'this legacy with pride' and will 'fight inequality, domination, occupation and inequality wherever it raises its ugly head. We will continue to stand with the oppressed of the world wherever they may be. We will never abandon the Palestinian people who stood with us in our darkest hour,' he added.

Hezbollah use Western Union and Whish to fund their terrorist act...	Israel uncovered Western Union's role as a vehicle for terrorism funding in 2017 when it exposed the 'equip a mujahid' campaign. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A campaign to raise funds to arm Hezbollah terrorists used Western Union and the money transfer platform Whish to secure money for the terror group. The campaign was featured on the Qatari website Al-Araby Al-Jadid (The New Arab) with ads that said, 'Lift your head high to the sky, and see where your support is,' referring to Hezbollah's aerial weapons. Readers are urged to donate money to the Islamic Resistance Support Organization (IRSO), which the US has designated as a terror group since 2006. The IRSO holds a number of accounts in Al-Qard al-Hassan (AQAH), which is Hezbollah's pseudo-banking system that the IDF targeted. According to the Jerusalem Post, the IRSO is asking donors to give money through Western Union and Whish (formerly WOO cash) as an alternative method of funding. Whish has 900 branches across Lebanon and is owned by Syrian nationals. According to its website, Whish offers domestic and international financial solutions, including money transfer services, currency exchange, e-wallets, and investments. Israel uncovered Western Union's role as a vehicle for terrorism funding in 2017 when it exposed the 'equip a mujahid' campaign. In response to questions about its platform being used to channel money to terrorists, Western Union said in a statement, 'We take our regulatory and compliance responsibilities very seriously, including our role in the fight against terrorist financing. To that effect, we have programs in place that screen Western Union transactions against internal and government watch lists.' Western Union added, 'Our internal Financial Intelligence Unit pursues intelligence leads and analysis about a broad range of global terror groups. We remain committed to working closely with governments and law enforcement authorities to continue addressing terrorist financing activities.' Whish Money cooperates with several companies across the globe, including Mastercard, US-based Ria Money Transfer and Sendwave, and UK-based Shift Transfer.

Israeli forces nab ISIS terrorist in Umm al-Fahm	Last week, seven Arabs from Jerusalem were arrested by security forces on suspicion of plotting to murder scientists and officials on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran. By JNS Israeli security forces earlier this month arrested an Arab national who swore allegiance to ISIS and had plans to carry out terror attacks in the Jewish state, the Israel Police and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) announced on Tuesday. The Arab suspect, identified by the Israel Police as 19-year-old Abed al-Rahman Mahajna from Umm al-Fahm in central Israel, was charged on Tuesday after being taken into custody approximately three weeks ago. According to authorities, Mahajna declared his allegiance to the terror organization in recent months and was involved in Arab riots during the Israel Defense Forces’ 'Operation Guardian of the Walls' in May 2021. During the arrest raid, security forces discovered documents with instructions on how to produce bombs, as well as a will he had prepared about a year ago in which he expressed his desire to become a 'martyr.' 'This incident joins the series of arrests made against Israeli citizens who planned to carry out terrorist activities in Israel,' an unnamed ISA official told local media, adding that 'the trend in which Israeli citizens are involved in terrorism and espionage is extremely serious, and security will act hard against those involved.' Last week, seven Arabs from Jerusalem were arrested by security forces on suspicion of plotting to murder scientists and officials on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The suspects, from the neighborhood of Beit Safafa in the eastern part of the Jewish state’s capital, were allegedly asked by Tehran to kill a nuclear scientist and the mayor of a large city. In August, Israeli forces dismantled an Arab-Israeli terrorist squad that had detailed plans to carry out a combined shooting and bombing in the Galilee region, the country’s security agencies revealed on Sept. 26. The cell, which was led by a resident of the town of Arraba in the Galilee and also included Palestinians from Judea and Samaria, was detained on Aug. 12, according to the Israel Police and ISA. Five months earlier, authorities nabbed 13 Arabs from northern Israel who were said to have been planning terrorist attacks on behalf of Hamas. The suspects, most of them residents of Sakhnin in the Lower Galilee, purchased weapons from terrorists in Judea and Samaria. One-third of Israel’s 2.095 million Arab citizens believe that Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre of primarily Jewish civilians is in line with Arab, Palestinian and Islamic values, according to a December 2023 poll.

Israel expects disabled soldier numbers to reach 100,000 by 2030	Approximately 14% of the wounded are classified as having moderate to severe injuries. By Pesach Benson, TPS Around 12,000 injured Israeli soldiers and security personnel have entered phyiscal rehabilitation since the October 7, 2023, according to figures released by the Defense Ministry on Tuesday. The ministry said this increase has led to a 20% rise in patient numbers over the past year, reaching nearly 74,000 individuals. Of these, about 1,500 have sustained injuries on two separate occasions during the fighting. Since the recent ground operation in Lebanon began, around 900 newly wounded soldiers have been evacuated to hospitals, marking a 1.5-fold increase in admissions compared to September. Young adults ages 18-30 represent 51% of all cases, with roughly 8,500 sustaining physical injuries. In addition, 5,200 individuals, or 43%, have developed mental health conditions due to the trauma of combat. According to ministry figures, two-thirds of the rehabilitating soldiers are reservists. Approximately 14% of the wounded are classified as having moderate to severe injuries, with 23 cases of serious head trauma, 60 amputees who now have prosthetics — including five who received fittings abroad — and 12 individuals who lost their sight. The Israel Defense Force’s Rehabilitation Division was already treating 62,000 injured soldiers from previous conflicts. The ministry anticipates that by 2030, the number of disabled IDF members could reach 100,000, with half of these cases involving mental health challenges. To meet the wartime need, the Defense Minstry has hired 500 therapists, established 10 rehabilitation farms, opened three specialized rehabilitation homes, and introduced emergency vehicles for immediate psychological aid. Since the October 7 attack, 776 soldiers have been killed, most recently four in northern Gaza from the IDF’s special forces 'Ghost Unit' on Tuesday. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hezbollah names Naim Qassem as new leader, Israel says he won’t l...	He is considered by many in Lebanon to lack the charisma and gravitas of Nasrallah. By Reuters and The Algemeiner The Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah named Naim Qassem as its new leader on Tuesday but Israel said his tenure would be 'temporary,' an apparent threat after it killed his predecessor Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut over a month ago. 'Temporary appointment. Not for long,' Israel‘s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant posted on X/Twitter with a photo of Qassem. Earlier, Iran-backed Hezbollah said in a written statement that its Shura Council had elected Qassem, 71, in accordance with its established mechanism for choosing a secretary general. Qassem was appointed as Hezbollah‘s deputy chief in 1991 by the armed group’s then-secretary general Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed by an Israeli helicopter attack the following year. Qassem remained in his role when Nasrallah became leader, and has long been one of Hezbollah‘s leading spokesmen, conducting interviews with foreign media, including while cross-border hostilities with Israel raged over the last year. Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27 in an Israeli air attack on Beirut’s southern suburbs, known as Dahiyeh, and senior Hezbollah figure Hashem Safieddine — considered the most likely successor — was killed in Israeli strikes a week later. Since Nasrallah’s killing, Qassem has given three televised addresses, including one on Oct. 8 in which he said the terrorist group supported efforts to reach a ceasefire for Lebanon. He is considered by many in Lebanon to lack the charisma and gravitas of Nasrallah. In its official Arabic account on X, the Israeli government said: 'His tenure in this position may be the shortest in the history of this terrorist organization if he follows in the footsteps of his predecessors Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine.' 'There is no solution in Lebanon except to dismantle this organization as a military force,' it wrote.

Knesset bans UNRWA, outlaws all official contact	The legislation, which the U.S. and E.U. oppose, follows revelations about the U.N. agency's complicity in Palestinian terrorism. By Canaan Lidor, Amelie Botbol, JNS Israel’s Knesset on Monday made it illegal for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to operate in Israeli territory, and for state officials to cooperate with the agency. The two laws were passed by a large majority following the exposure of UNRWA staff complicity in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, and despite pressure from the United States and other countries against the move. The Biden Administration was 'deeply concerned' about the legislation, according to an unnamed U.S. State Department official cited by Axios. This echoes language used by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken prior to the vote. Josep Borrell, the E.U. High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, tweeted that the new laws 'would de facto render UNRWA’s vital operations in Gaza impossible, and seriously hamper its provision of services in the West Bank.' The laws stand 'in stark contradiction to international law and the fundamental principle of humanity,' he added. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini tweeted that the legislation 'opposes the U.N. Charter and violates the State of Israel’s obligations under international law.' However, experts on UNRWA, including former Israeli lawmaker Einat Wilf, who has written an acclaimed book about the agency, dispute that the legislation contradicts international law. Israel is not party to any treaty compelling it to engage with the group or allow its activities, Wilf told JNS. Israeli Sanctions on UNRWA The two laws are by far the most robust parliamentary push by Israel against UNRWA, the largest donors of which are the United States and the European Union. The agency has for decades has been accused of providing cover and income to Palestinian terrorists while undermining peace efforts. The law that bans UNRWA activity on Israeli territory, authored by Knesset member Boaz Bismuth (Likud) and six other coalition lawmakers, was passed by a majority of 87 of the Knesset’s 120 lawmakers. Nine MKs present voted against the law, one did not vote. The remaining 23 lawmakers were not present for the vote. 'UNRWA—United Nations Relief and Works Agency will operate no representation, provide no service or hold any activity, directly or indirectly, in the sovereign territory of the State of Israel,' the law co authored by Bismuth states. The second law, passed by 92-10, states: 'No state authority, including entities and individuals who legally hold public office, will engage in any contact with UNRWA or its representatives.' This legislation was coauthored by MKs Yulia Malinovsky (Yisrael Beiteinu), Dan Illouz (Likud) and Ron Katz (Yesh Atid). 'UNRWA will not operate in Israel, their benefits will be canceled, their entry to Israel will be banned. Total Disconnect,' Malinovsky tweeted following the votes. According to its website, UNRWA employs some 30,000 staff, most of them Palestinians, including 13,000 in the Gaza Strip. It also has staff in Judea and Samaria and eastern Jerusalem. UNRWA also operates in Jordan and Lebanon. Being banned in Israel could end UNRWA’s work in Jerusalem and greatly complicate its operations in Gaza and Judea and Samaria, where the organization is at least partially dependent on Israeli cooperation. UNRWA's Links to Hamas In the wake of the Oct. 7 massacres in Israel, in which Hamas terrorists murdered some 1,200 people and abducted another 251, evidence surfaced about the complicity of UNRWA staff in those atrocities and other acts of terrorism. For example, UNRWA worker Faisal Ali Mussalem al-Naami and a colleague were captured on video loading the body of Israeli Yonatan Samerano into a vehicle in Sderot. According to Israel, over 450 terrorists belonging to terrorist organizations in Gaza, mainly Hamas, are also employed by UNRWA. UNRWA’s Lazzarini has flatly denied these allegations. On Sept. 29, Hamas admitted that Fatah Sharif Abu al-Amin, chairman of UNRWA’s Teachers’ Association, was its commander in Lebanon. The agency had suspended Abu al-Amin in March, yet after his death denied knowing he was involved in terrorism. UNRWA-employed Arabic teacher Yusef Zidan Suleiman al-Hawajara was recorded bragging to a friend on Oct. 7 about capturing a female hostage. ('We have female hostages, I captured one!' he says in a recording released by the IDF.) In July, Israel’s foreign ministry published a list of names and ID numbers of 108 UNRWA employees Israel accuses of being Hamas terrorists. It was a 'small fraction,' a Foreign Ministry official wrote, of a much larger list including hundreds of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members who also worked for UNRWA. The wider list could not be released due to security considerations. On Oct. 13, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin sent a letter about the agency to Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Defense Minister Yoav Galant. In the letter, which demanded Israel increase the amount of aid being let into the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, they noted that they were 'deeply concerned' about the Knesset bills. An Uncertain Future UNRWA had a budget of about $1.1 billion in 2023. Eighteen countries suspended funding to UNRWA following the Oct. 7 attack, including the United States, which provides roughly a third of the organization’s budget. The United States froze its donations to UNRWA until March 2025. Only it and New Zealand have not yet reinstated their funding. As of Tuesday morning, it was unclear how donor countries would respond to the Israeli move. 'We will have to look at how UNRWA donors respond. In the past week, they have been threatening Israel to not take this move, but it will be interesting to see whether or not they enforce Israel’s decision,' Anne Herzberg, legal adviser at the Jerusalem-based NGO Monitor organization, told JNS on Tuesday. According to Herzberg, while the Israeli move is a blow to UNRWA, it will not end the agency. 'While Israel can prevent UNRWA from operating on its own territory, they can’t block the organization from operating in Lebanon, Jordan or other countries,' she noted. 'In my opinion this move won’t be the end of UNRWA, but I would hope that responsible governments such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom or Germany take this as an opportunity to engage in significant investigations,' she added. While it has been obvious for years that Hamas is stealing money from UNRWA and using its installations, the organization has refused to put safeguards in place, she said, emphasizing that the agency itself is to blame for the Israeli move. 'If UNRWA indeed plays such a vital role, then the international community must implement reforms as well as bring criminal charges not only against UNRWA employees who participated in Oct. 7 but also officials who not only allowed Hamas to exploit UNRWA’s facilities and money but looked the other way,' she told JNS. 'In addition to UNRWA there are another 13 U.N. agencies operating in Gaza and 23 in Judea and Samaria; there are other actors who could step in to fill the role that UNRWA has been playing,' she continued. 'It’s not so much about getting the humanitarian aid in, it’s really about what is being done to protect that system in Gaza with Hamas in control, and rather than trying to find solutions, the United Nations and other aid organizations tried relaxing or even eliminating vetting processes,' she added. Through UNRWA, the United Nations employs a unique refugee definition to Palestinians. The agency defines as refugees not only those who fled the 1948 war, but their descendants in perpetuity until a 'just solution' emerges for their status. The United Nations employs a different definition for all other refugees, who cannot pass the title to their descendants and often lose it when they are naturalized elsewhere. This has perpetuated the Israeli-Palestinian conflict according to many critics, including Hillel Neuer, the founder of U.N. Watch. 'What the Knesset did yesterday is extremely significant,' Neuer told JNS on Tuesday, though he too said that the new legislation would not close UNRWA down. 'The legislation will require closing UNRWA’s facilities in Jerusalem. Israeli officials are barred from dealing with UNRWA representatives operating in the West Bank and Gaza, it will make UNRWA’s operations more difficult, I don’t think it will necessarily close them,' he said. However, he added, the move by Israel had a greater significance. 'Beyond the concrete consequences, a very important message was sent, which is ‘no more,’' he said. 'No more will Israel tolerate an agency that has a pathological agenda. The aim of UNRWA is not distributing aid, it is teaching Palestinians that they will dismantle Israel,' he continued. 'Terrorists factions say openly that UNRWA is witness to the injustice they suffered. They want to undo this injustice, and Oct. 7 is the continuation of UNRWA. The message of UNRWA is to encourage Oct. 7,' he said. Neuer explained that back in 2011, UNRWA knew that the head of its teachers’ union in Gaza, Suhail al-Hindi, was a Hamas official and did nothing. 'They allowed him to be the head of the teachers union, he was elected to the Hamas politburo in Gaza. Eventually in 2017 he was asked to resign and go away quietly. When they were pressured to suspend him, 8,000 teachers in Gaza rallied and shut UNRWA down for three months off and on,' Neuer said. With regard to Lebanon, 'UNRWA knows that its staff supports Hamas in Lebanon,' he added. 'We sent information that the head of their teachers’ union in Lebanon was a Hamas official. Israel eliminated him last month. Last week, Israel eliminated an UNRWA truck driver and he was the head of the Hamas terrorist squad that on Oct. 7 assaulted [the Kibbutz] Re’im bomb shelter,' he continued. 'If this were a normal agency, the head of the agency would resign,' he added. As for what comes next, there is still some uncertainty, he said. 'Immediately, there is no direct impact to UNRWA in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. The direct effect is on UNRWA in Jerusalem. Israel will have to think about the schools and facilities and provide alternatives. Israel already provides all governmental service to Arabs in eastern Jerusalem and there is no reason why they can’t do the same for Shuafat,' he continued. 'The more complicated thing is the prohibition on dealing with UNRWA in Gaza and Judea and Samaria. It is not clear what will happen next, it’s not entirely clear. There will be a few months for the law to go into effect and there will be a lot of pressure on Israel to somehow freeze the law. I don’t think Israel should surrender,' he said. 'The important thing to remember is that Palestinians are prisoners of assistance that keeps them in permanent dependency. UNRWA dooms Palestinians to a cycle of dependency. It calls itself an aid agency but it is a Palestinian war agency. The whole point of UNRWA is to tell Palestinians that their future is to dismantle Israel,' he concluded.

Four soldiers killed in Gaza, bringing IDF toll to 776	On Monday, an IDF soldier wounded in the northern Strip earlier this month succumbed to his wounds. By JNS Four more Israel Defense Forces soldiers were killed fighting Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip, the military announced on Tuesday afternoon. They were identified as Cpt. Yehonatan Joni Keren, 22, from Moledet; Staff Sgt. Nisim Meytal, 20, from Hadera; Staff Sgt. Aviv Gilboa, 21, from Neve Tzuf; and Staff Sgt. Naor Haimov, 22, from Rosh Ha’ayin. All four served in the IDF’s elite Multidimensional Unit. An officer in the unit was seriously wounded in the incident that killed the four. On Monday, an IDF soldier wounded in the northern Strip earlier this month succumbed to his wounds, the army announced. Maj. Guy Yaacov Nezri, 25, of the 401st Armored Brigade’s 52nd Battalion, from Atlit, was seriously hurt in Jabalia on Oct. 19. The IDF death toll in Gaza since the start of the ground operation there on Oct. 27, 2023, stands at 365, while the figure on all fronts since Oct. 7, 2023 is 776. Additionally, Ch. Insp.

IDF declares military victory in south Lebanon, calls for negotia...	Israel's military has achieved its goals against the Hezbollah terror organization in southern Lebanon, according to report, paving the way for a possible truce to end the conflict. By World Israel News Staff Israel has achieved all of its military goals in southern Lebanon and is now in a position to reach a negotiated settlement ending the current conflict with the Hezbollah terror organization, Walla News reported Tuesday. The IDF was deployed to southern Lebanon beginning on October 1st, with the goal of dismantling Hezbollah's terrorist infrastructure in the area of the Israel-Lebanon frontier and pushing the terrorist group away from Israel's border, thus neutralizing its ability to target Israeli border towns. The Israeli military has now achieved those goals, the IDF's Northern Command has determined, according to the report by Walla, that most of Hezbollah's infrastructure along the Israeli border has been destroyed. In addition, most of the Iranian-backed terror group's weapons in the border zone have either been destroyed or captured, the report claimed, citing the Northern Command. While the border area has largely been cleared of Hezbollah, the army reportedly acknowledged that some villages in southern Lebanon must still be operated in, with the army waiting on the Shin Bet intelligence agency to complete its work. Nevertheless, despite some remaining operations required in specific villages, the report claimed that the Israeli military has determined that the government is now in a position to begin negotiations with Hezbollah to reach a truce ending the current conflict. Should the Israeli government not pursue or should it fail to achieve a ceasefire in southern Lebanon enabling the IDF to withdraw, the military predicts that one of two possible scenarios will occur. Either the status quo will continue, with the IDF enhancing its military pressure on Hezbollah, or Israel will consolidate its control over parts southern Lebanon.

Poll: Israelis back Trump over Harris by 4-to-1 margin	Just one out of six Israelis say they hope Vice President Kamala Harris win's next week's presidential election. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News With just one week to go before election day in the United States, polls show a virtual dead-heat between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, both in national polling and in the seven battle-ground states that are expected to determine the outcome of the election. But while Americans appear to be nearly evenly divided ahead of the election, the vast majority of Israelis say they prefer Trump to win, according to a new poll. The survey, conducted by the Midgam polling agency on Monday via telephone and internet, was published by Israel's Channel 12 on Tuesday morning. The poll, which included 507 adult Israeli respondents, found that nearly two-thirds (66%) of Israeli Jews and Arabs say they prefer to see Trump in the White House, rather than Harris. Just 17% of Israelis said they hope Harris wins next Tuesday's election. A similar percentage said they had no opinion regarding the election. Among Israelis who said they voted in the previous election for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, 93% said they favor a second Trump term, compared to just 1% who said they hope to see Harris win next week's election. Tuesday's poll also found that more than half (57%) of Israelis say they were satisfied with Israel's response over the weekend to Iran's October 1st ballistic missile attack on Israel. By comparison, 32% said they were dissatisfied with Israel's retaliatory strikes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the candidate of choice for a plurality of Israelis, according to the poll, including in a head-to-head matchup against former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who has led Netanyahu in previous polls. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said they preferred Netanyahu as premier over Bennett, compared to 35% who said they would prefer Bennett as premier. Netanyahu led former Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Opposition Leader Yair Lapid by wider margins.

600 Hamas terrorists surrender in northern Gaza	Among those who surrendered are terrorists who participated in the October 7 massacres. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Six hundred terrorists have surrendered and been captured so far in Jabalia after the IDF cut off the northern Gazan region several weeks ago where the so-called refugee camp is located. Some 120 were taken in a raid over the weekend of the local hospital that Hamas was using as a primary command-and-control center. About 20 terrorists were killed and 60 captured in the IDF foray into the Kamal Adwan Hospital. Another 60 were found hiding among the patients, along with cash, documents and weaponry that had been stashed throughout the medical complex. The IDF publicized clips from an interrogation of a paramedic from the hospital, who said that Hamas fighters were everywhere in what was legally a protected space for civilians. 'Hamas military operatives are present. They are in the courtyards, at the gates of the buildings, in the offices,' he said. 'They operate ambulances to transport their wounded military operatives and to transport them for their missions,' he continued. 'This is instead of using the ambulances for the benefit of civilians.' Some of those seized had been among the forces that invaded Israel last October in the surprise attack in which mainly Hamas terrorists massacred 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians. 'The surprise for Hamas was complete,' the IDF said regarding the operation. 'We trapped hundreds of terrorists inside the camp, including senior operatives.' Prior to the raid, as the hospital was also acting as a treatment center, the IDF had allowed it to continue its emergency care of civilians and helped supply the emergency systems as well. Three IDF brigades, including armored brigades, had essentially cut off the northern Gaza Strip in recent weeks after finding out that those Hamas operatives who remained in the area were regrouping, for the most part in Jabalia . The army ordered residents to evacuate to the south, and some 50,000 fled through humanitarian corridors the army set up. Soldiers looked for and arrested suspected Hamas fighters among the refugees. The terrorists attempted to stop civilians from fleeing, army sources said, even shooting some people in the legs to deter their human shields from leaving. 'In the last week,' they said, 'the fear barrier of Hamas was broken.' Most of the residents, they added, went no further south than Gaza City. While one brigade has now been transferred elsewhere, two remain for mop-up operations, as there are still an estimated several hundred Hamas fighters left in the camp. The army said that their enemy’s tactics have devolved into guerilla warfare, with the terrorists making more use of IEDs rather than fighting IDF troops head-on. 'These are not the battalions and companies we saw at the beginning of the fighting a year ago. They are on the verge of breaking. Their combat capability is significantly lower. In the first round, we didn’t see 600 terrorists surrendering,' the IDF stated.

Floyd Mayweather Jr., ranked as one of the greatest professional boxers in history, pays a solidarity visit to Israel, meeting with IDF soldiers wounded during the ongoing war against Hamas and Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff American boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. paid a visit to Israel this week, marking his fourth trip to the country since the October 7th invasion. During his trip, Mayweather visited Belev Echad’s rehabilitation center in Kiryat Ono, Israel, to meet with and offer his support to Israeli soldiers who were wounded during the recent conflict. Mayweather, widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, retired with an undefeated record of 50-0. Known for his extraordinary defensive skills, speed, and strategic prowess in the ring, Mayweather has won world titles in five different weight classes over his career. Beyond his athletic achievements, he has also become a prominent figure for his philanthropic endeavors, lending his support to various causes worldwide. During the visit in Kiryat Ono, Mayweather expressed admiration and solidarity with the injured soldiers. 'I'm happy to be here. I see so many bright faces, so many beautiful people. You guys are brave warriors. I take my hat off to everyone in here that goes on that battlefield.' 'Everyone can do your job, just like everyone can do my job. We all got to be team players. You guys are team players. I'm proud of you all. Hold your head up high and just know every day is a blessing. We can't take anything for granted. You guys are true heroes, warriors, and I'm behind you 100%. I'll be back, and you guys have my support.' Moti Fried, who accompanied Mayweather on his visit in Israel, remarked on the dedication of the boxing icon. 'It's simply unbelievable that he drops everything and comes here for the fourth time. He’s a legend in his field, and his love for Israel and the Jewish people is something truly exceptional.' Rabbi Uriel and Shevy Vigler, founders of Belev Echad, expressed their deep appreciation for Mayweather’s visit. 'Floyd’s support and compassion mean the world to these soldiers,' said Rabbi Vigler. 'His visit lifts their spirits and reminds them that people across the globe are standing with them.' Shevy Vigler added, 'Floyd’s connection to our soldiers speaks volumes. His presence here brings hope and a renewed sense of strength to those who have sacrificed so much for Israel.'

5,000-year-old town discovered west of Jerusalem	Archeologists unearth 5,000-year-old town outside of Beit Shemesh, shedding light on the early urbanization of the region. By World Israel News Staff A 5,000-year-old settlement, which provides a view of the beginning of the urbanization process in the Levant, was discovered in the Israel Antiquities Authority excavations near Beit Shemesh at the site of Hurvat Husham. The excavations took place in preparation for the expansion of the city’s western industrial zone, 'Brosh', at the initiative of the Shamir Engineering Group and the Bet Shemesh Economic Development Company. The excavation revealed, among other things, a public building that may have been used for ritual activity, and in it a room with about 40 vessels preserved intact. Among them were also many tiny vessels, whose size suggests they were not for domestic use, but rather had a mainly symbolic purpose. The vessels were preserved in their original place – just as they were placed by the people living there in the Early Bronze Age IB (end of the 4th millennium BCE). 'It is interesting that these many pots and juglets were placed here just shortly before the entire site was abandoned forever,' said Ariel Shatil, Maayan Hamed and Danny Benayoun, the Israel Antiquities Authority excavation directors. 'You can literally imagine the people who put down this ware and left it all here. It is not known what happened in this room later, but there are signs of burning, and vessels that fell on top of each other.' 'Laboratory examination of their former contents of the vessels using different scientific methods will shed additional light on the site: We will be able to tell if they contained oil, water, wheat – or perhaps they were specifically for exotic oils or other substances.' 'The size of this structure that we uncovered, its broad walls, the benches inside it and other variables indicate that it is an important and exceptional structure with a public function – perhaps a temple,' say the excavation managers. 'We know almost no public buildings in Israel from this ancient period and earlier,' say the researchers. 'Comparison with the few known buildings of this type produces the conclusion that this is probably one of the earliest temples ever discovered in the Judean Lowlands.' Near the public building, a complex was discovered with large standing stones arranged in rows. 'The standing stones were erected even before this enclosed public building was erected. Their presence promises to be instructive of the socio-political process involved in the founding of the cultic service in Hurvat Husham – it seems that originally there was an open cultic activity area for the general public which then transformed into ritual activity in an enclosed compound with more controlled access.' 'This development process on the site, along with other processes, attests to an increase in social complexity,' says Dr. Yitzhak Paz, Early Bronze Age expert at the Israel Antiquities Authority. 'This is one of the indicators of urbanization development in Israel during the Early Bronze Age. Two kilns for pottery manufacture were also discovered at the site, from the earliest ever discovered in Israel.' The ancient settlement in Hurvat Husham was first discovered in 2021, in excavations conducted by Marion Zindel and Natan Ben-Ari on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. In the last three-and-a-half years the excavation was expanded which clarified the extent of the site and its importance for understanding the origins of the urbanization process in Israel. The Early Bronze Age is one of the most complex periods in Israel's history, during which dramatic changes took place in the lifestyle and worldview of the region’s inhabitants. The number of people who lived in Israel increased dramatically. For the first time social complexity was created, as well as the political structure of a hierarchical society. At the peak of the period, the acceleration of the urbanization phenomenon is evident, and monumental public construction can already be seen –fortifications, religious and government buildings, expertise and standardization in various industries, and more intensive trade with neighboring regions such as Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia. 'The site uncovered in Hurvat Husham is exceptional not only because of its size, but because it reveals to us some of the first characteristics of the transition from village life to urban life,' say the excavation managers. 'The site teaches us that about 5,000 years ago, the first steps were already taken towards the development of an urban society in the Judean Lowlands. A few generations later, we already see large cities in the area, surrounded by a wall, with palaces and other buildings – such as at the site of Tel Yarmouth, which is in this site’s range of vision.' According to Israel Antiquities Authority Director Eli Escusido, 'The Land of Israel, due to its nature and its geographical location, was a fertile ground for the development of ancient civilizations. The Hurvat Husham site uncovered by the researchers of the Israel Antiquities Authority, reveals another important piece in the puzzle of urban development in our region.'

Yemenite drone strike on Israeli coastal city	No one was hurt in the attack, with the projectile falling in an open area. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Ashkelon residents woke up Tuesday morning at 6:40 to sirens warning of the penetration of a threatening UAV headed in their direction. By 6:57, the IDF announced that the incident was over, and twelve minutes later updated that an unmanned aerial vehicle 'from the east' had fallen in an 'open area' in the area of the coastal city that sits close to the northern border of the Gaza Strip. No one was hurt, but a fire broke out in the brambles and bushes where the projectile hit earth. Firefighters and the police were dispatched to put it out and deal with the UAV fragments. An hour and a half later, the army officially stated that the threat had emanated from the Houthis, the Iranian proxy terror group that controls large sections of Yemen. 'Following an initial examination regarding the UAV that fell in an open area in Ashkelon in southern Israel earlier today, it was determined that the UAV was launched from Yemen,' the IDF said in a statement. This is the second time in six weeks that a Houthi projectile managed to penetrate Israel’s air defenses. In mid-September, the terrorists fired what they called a 'hypersonic ballistic missile' at the center of the country, sending over a million Israelis racing for bomb shelters and safe rooms. The missile was hit by an interceptor and fragmented over a large area, doing some damage to a train station in Modiin. Nine people were slightly injured running for cover. Air raid sirens warning of a UAV attack also wailed Tuesday morning around 7am in the Western Galilee city of Nahariya and its environs. This time the UAV was fired from Lebanon, and was shot down mid-air by IAF jets as it was heading for populated areas. Pieces of either the interceptor, UAV, or both hit a train car near the station and one of the cables holding up a pedestrian bridge, with no injuries reported. Hezbollah then launched a barrage of over 40 rockets at the border communities and western northern Galilee in a two-minute period starting at 10:38. Residents reported hearing the booms of missile interceptors hitting their targets. No injuries were immediately reported as the police began scanning the areas where falls were recorded. The IDF reported that over the last 24 hours, dozens of Hezbollah terrorists have been eliminated in South Lebanon by its ground forces and over 110 terror targets were destroyed, including rocket launchers and weaponry warehouses.

Elite police unit held off dozens of Hamas terrorists on October ...	A small number of Unit 33 police officers battled 30 truckloads of Hamas terrorists, preventing them from reaching central Israel. By World Israel News Staff A handful of officers from an elite police unit managed to hold off dozens of invading terrorists for hours on October 7th, 2023, preventing terror cells from reaching the center of the country. Speaking to Channel 12 News, three officers from Unit 33 - also known as Gideonim - spoke about the intense firefight against some 30 trucks and cars carrying Hamas terrorists. One member of the unit, identified only by his Hebrew first initial, Ayin, said that he knew that there was a major incident unfolding when he and other officers were called up and told to report to the South. Ayin saw videos circulating on social media showing terrorists driving through the streets of Sderot, a city adjacent to Gaza. He explained to Channel 12 that security forces classify border breaches according to their severity. Stage A means terrorists have crossed the border, Stage B means that they've reached nearby communities, Stage C means that they've reached Southern cities, and Stage D means that terrorists are bound for major cities in central Israel, such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. 'To me, [the situation] looked like somewhere between ‘C’ and ‘D’,' Ayin told Channel 12. Ayin recounted he and his unit members met at the Black Arrow Memorial, in Mefalsim, less than a kilometer away from the Gaza border. However, the officers were unaware that the site was being used as a staging area for terrorists aiming to drive to central Israeli cities to expand the terror onslaught. At least 30 pickup trucks and cars carrying heavily armed Hamas terrorists were present at the site. They opened fire on the officers, wounding two. The Gideonim officers managed to fire back, engaging in a fearsome battle for hours until IDF units arrived. Despite taking fire from two sides, none of the elite unit's members were killed. The officers killed dozens of terrorists, preventing a more widespread infiltration of Israel.

‘Antisemitic’ – Coldplay store damaged Israel-bound merchandise	Band memorabilia sent to Israel was intentionally damaged; shipping company offers refunds, but won't investigate. By World Israel News Staff Israeli fans of the band Coldplay were shocked to discover that merchandise they ordered was intentionally damaged, presumably because the items were bound for Israel. Numerous Israelis, who are members of Coldplay's fan club, ordered special-edition merchandise that included a record and inserts autographed by the band's members. 'I opened the package and saw that everything was torn and the autographs were ripped,' Coldplay fan Emily Pink told TV journalist Guy Pines. Pink said she had confirmed with other Coldplay fans that everyone in Israel received damaged merchandise. 'A lot of us believe this is antisemitic. This is something that we paid money for, and the damage isn't a mistake - it's intentional,' she added. Idan Karlan, another Coldplay fan, said that everyone who ordered merchandise to Israel received damaged items. 'Apparently the shipping company destroyed the merchandise on purpose when they saw that the package was bound for Israel,' Karlan told Guy Pines. Karlan said that he had received an unsatisfactory response by the shipping company, and that the business appeared to be uninterested in discovering the source of the intentional damage. 'There is something big here, that all packages are sent to Israel damaged like this,' said Karlan. But the 'company simply said, 'here's a full refund, thanks and bye.' Since then, they haven't responded to us.' Shir Beno, who also received damaged merchandise, stressed that the band and shipping company need to take responsibility for the intentional damage. 'It's not about money,' Beno said. 'We should not be sent damaged products just because we are from Israel. If this is due to antisemitism, it needs to be dealt with immediately.' Pink and Karlan said that they were extremely disappointed that Coldplay has not publicly commented on the intentionally damaged merchandise. 'I see them in a different light now,' Pink said.

Israel weighing second attack on Iran, targeting new sites: Repor...	Cabinet members reportedly discussed options for an additional strike on Iran, in a meeting that lasted more than six hours. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet is seriously weighing launching a second attack against Iran, following a strike on the Islamic Republic last weekend. Saturday's strike came after Iran's unprecedented October 1 attack on Israel, which saw Tehran launch some 200 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State. Three weeks later, Israel destroyed numerous strategic sites in Iran, including drone and missile production factories and part of the country's air defense system. But according to Hebrew-language media reports, Israel may launch an additional attack on Iran, specifically as a response for the drone attack on Netanyahu's Caesarea residence. Cabinet members discussed the potential second attack for more than six hours, according to reports. Senior officials, speaking anonymously to Channel 13, said that Iran's governmental buildings and infrastructure - which were avoided in Saturday's attack - may be targeted in the next round of strikes. However, the meeting ended without cabinet ministers and members making a decision regarding moving forward with another attack. Ynet reported that Iran had the ability to launch missiles at Israel during the attack on Saturday, but chose to avoid doing so. Despite public threats by Iranian officials to 'punish' Israel for the recent strike, Israel believes that Tehran is not gearing up for a counter-attack on Israel in the near future. In April, Iran launched a huge aerial assault against Israel, which included explosive drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. While most of those projectiles were intercepted outside of Israeli airspace, the attack marked the first time that Iran directly attacked Israel. After Iran attacked Israel for the second time in six months, Israeli officials said they would strike Iran in a manner which would restore deterrence. However, under heavy American pressure, Israel avoided striking Iran's nuclear development sites and oil assets. Instead, the Israeli airstrikes focused exclusively on military sites, including drone and missile manufacturing centers.

Harris sidelines Biden in final campaign push	The vice president’s team believes Biden is a risk to Harris on the campaign trail but is wary of directly saying they don't want the unpopular president to rally for her. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon In the final days before the election, Vice President Kamala Harris is sidelining her boss, President Joe Biden, over concerns that the octogenarian is a political liability, Axios reported. Harris has no scheduled events with Biden with just eight days until the election. Biden has repeatedly left days open on his schedule to campaign for Harris, but her team has let those days pass without any response, according to sources familiar with the matter. 'He's a reminder of the last four years, not the new way forward,' one source familiar with the situation told Axios. Since replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris has worked to distance herself from the octogenarian and the unpopular policies that brought the administration's approval ratings down to record lows. This dynamic has led to rising tension between Harris’s campaign team and Biden’s senior staff leading up to the election. One person familiar with the situation compared it to a slow, drawn-out break-up between Biden and Harris. The vice president’s team believes Biden is a risk to Harris on the campaign trail but is wary of directly saying they don't want the unpopular president to rally for her. In an email detailing Harris’s Saturday schedule, her campaign highlighted planned events with actress Kerry Washington, Saginaw mayor Brenda Moore (Mich.), Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and others, but Biden's weekend campaigning in Pittsburgh wasn't included on the list. Biden and his team have repeatedly highlighted Harris’s involvement in the White House over the last four years. Earlier this month, Biden praised his vice president for being a 'major player' in all of their administration's actions, saying they were 'singing from the same song sheet.' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has also said that Harris's policy aims are 'aligned' with Biden, stating, 'There's not been any daylight' between the pair’s decisions. When asked this month if she would have 'done something differently than President Biden,' Harris responded, 'There is not a thing that comes to mind.'

‘No legal barrier to banning UNRWA’: Knesset due to blacklist age...	The international community has been pressing Israel not to blacklist UNRWA, claiming there is no alternative in Gaza providing assistance to the local population. By Anna Epshtein, TPS The Israeli Knesset is due to vote on Monday night on a pair of bills banning the controversial United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) from operating in Israel and Gaza. The bills, offered for final vote, would strip UNRWA of its diplomatic immunity and tax-exempt privileges, ban Israeli officials from having any contact with agency staffers and revoke the 1967 exchange of notes between Israel and UNRWA which provided the legal basis for the agency’s activities. UNRWA has been under fire for months, with Israeli officials demanding the agency be stripped of its authority in Gaza and defunded amid revelations that members of the agency’s staff participated in Hamas’s October 7 attacks. 'There is no legal barrier for banning UNRWA from operating in Israel and in the Gaza Strip,' Yifa Segal, an expert in international law and the founder of the International Legal Forum NGO, told The Press Service of Israel. 'The exchange of notes between Israel and UNRWA from 1967 explicitly states that Israel voluntarily agreed to help UNRWA to operate from its territory, and that ‘a provisional agreement between UNRWA and the Government of Israel is to remain in force until replaced or canceled.'' Segal said. 'The time has come to cancel it.' Palestinian refugees are the only refugee population with its own dedicated UN agency. The rest of the world’s refugees fall under the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The international community has been pressing Israel not to blacklist UNRWA, claiming there is no alternative in Gaza providing assistance to the local population. 'But we see that the alternative is emerging – there are numerous aid organizations in Gaza that provide assistance and do not host terror at the same time,' Segal said. 'I think when the world sees that there is an alternative, and providing that Israeli stance on the matter will be firm, it will be only the matter of time that UNRWA will stop getting financing from the European governments.' In July, Israel gave the UN the names of around 100 UNRWA personnel who participated in the attack, held hostages, or were members of Hamas. However, the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services, which investigates mismanagement, fraud, corruption, and other misconduct, only probed 19 personnel. The OIOS did not indicate why it did not investigate the dozens of other workers. Of the 19 staffers who were investigated, the OIOS said nine 'may have been involved in the armed attacks' and that 'the employment of these individuals will be terminated in the interests of the Agency.' On October 24, a Hamas commander who led the assault on a bomb shelter near Kibbutz Re’im and was also a UNRWA employee was killed in an Israeli airstrike. An agency spokesperson confirmed that the commander’s name was included in an Israeli letter in July which identified other Hamas figures on the staff. More than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA in June, accusing the agency of 'aiding and abetting' the terror group. According to the suit, the lead plaintiff, 84-year-old Ditza Heiman of Kibbutz Nir Oz, was held captive for seven weeks in the home of a Palestinian man who said he was a UNRWA teacher at a boy’s school. Israel’s largest bank froze UNRWA’s account in February over suspicious financial transfers that the agency failed to adequately explain. That same month, Israeli forces discovered a Hamas complex located directly under the UNRWA’s Gaza City headquarters and connected directly to the agency’s electricity system. The facility included numerous computer servers belonging to the terror group. UNRWA was also ordered to vacate its Jerusalem offices in May over lease violations. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hamas rejects limited hostage release and ceasefire deal proposed...	Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi proposed an initial two-day ceasefire and hostage-for-prisoner exchange intended to lead to a more comprehensive deal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A day after Egypt proposed a 48-hour ceasefire coinciding with the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, Hamas has rejected the plan, according to a source quoted by e Quds Press news agency on Monday. The source claimed, 'Based on the immense sense of responsibility placed on its shoulders, Hamas always shows readiness to seriously examine proposals conveyed by the mediators.' At the resumption of negotiations in Qatar on Sunday, Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi proposed an initial two-day ceasefire and hostage-for-prisoner exchange intended to lead to a more comprehensive deal. The plan would begin with a 48-hour ceasefire, during which four hostages with foreign citizenship would be released in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. During this period, the delivery of humanitarian aid will be facilitated in Gaza. For the duration, the IDF would remain within Gaza but refrain from operating armored vehicles. On news that Egypt had proposed the two-day ceasefire and hostages for the prisoners release plan, a Palestinian source told Reuters on Sunday that Hamas would be unlikely to accept any deal without a full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza and an end to the war from the outset. The Palestinian official told Reuters, 'I expect Hamas would listen to the new offers, but it remains determined that any agreement must end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza.' On Monday, Netanyahu indicated he would be willing to accept the temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal. At a Likud meeting, he said, 'If there were a deal for a two-day ceasefire to release four hostages, I would take it immediately.' Netanyahu has insisted throughout the war that 'total victory' is the ultimate goal and that he would not be willing to accept a hostage deal that would compromise Israel's objective of ridding Gaza of Hamas as a political and military power. In September, Netanyahu expressed his firm resolve that he would not accept a hostage deal that would force the IDF to abandon the Philadelphi corridor on the border between Gaza and Egypt. The war cabinet voted to retain the condition that Israel would control the Philadelphi corridor as part of any hostage or ceasefire agreement, with National Security Minister Ben Gvir abstaining from the vote. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant voted against it and argued that the IDF could vacate the Philadelphi corridor temporarily as a means to get the hostages released. However, Netanyahu criticized this approach in the press conference without mentioning Gallant by name. 'They tell me to leave, and then we'll return; I've already been in this movie. If we leave – we won't return,' the prime minister added. He stressed that the 'axis of evil' headed by Iran needs access to the Philadelphi corridor, and when Israel was operating there, the enemy had to shift its tactics. 'Only when we entered Philadelphia did we feel a change in the war. For months Hamas did not budge in negotiations for a deal. The first crack came after we entered Rafah and Philadelphi,' Netanyahu said.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated he would potentially accept a limited hostage release deal coinciding with a 48-hour ceasefire, as proposed by Egypt. 'If there was a deal for a two-day ceasefire to release four hostages, I would take it immediately,' Netanyahu stated at the weekly Likud faction meeting. At the resumption of negotiations in Qatar on Sunday, Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi proposed an initial two-day ceasefire and hostage-for-prisoner exchange intended to lead to a more comprehensive deal. The preliminary deal would release four hostages to Israel in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. At a press conference attended by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, al-Sisi expressed hopes that the initial hostage release would lead to a permanent agreement. Last night, a Palestinian source told Reuters that Hamas is likely to consider proposals. Still, it emphasizes a complete ceasefire and a withdrawal of IDF troops from Gaza before hostages are released. The Palestinian official told Reuters, 'I expect Hamas would listen to the new offers, but it remains determined that any agreement must end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza.' For Israel's part, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a condition for a ceasefire is the realization of Israel's goals during the war, namely to eliminate Hamas's political and military control of Gaza. After Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed, Netanyahu urged Hamas to lay down their arms and release the hostages. He said that any Gazans holding hostages will be spared if they lay down their weapons and release captives. 'To the Hamas terrorists, I say: your leaders are fleeing, and they will be eliminated,' Netanyahu said. Addressing families of hostages, Netanyahu said, 'This is an important moment in the war. We will continue with full force until all your loved ones — our loved ones — are returned home. That is our supreme obligation. That is my supreme obligation.

How Israel’s long-awaited counterstrike weakened Iran	Regional analysts believe Israel put up to half of its air force in the sky during the operation, with all pilots returning home unscathed. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Israel’s long-awaited counterstrike on Iran destroyed large swaths of the Islamic Republic's air defenses, including Russian-made missile systems, leaving Tehran more vulnerable than ever to future strikes by the Jewish state or other adversaries. 'We should understand that Tehran is naked right now, the ayatollah has no clothes,' said Richard Goldberg, a former White House National Security Council member who worked the Iran portfolio. 'Israel destroyed Iran’s strategic air defense capabilities and set back its missile and drone production extensively.' Though Iran knew the attack was coming—and was even able to prepare following the explosive leak of classified American intelligence on Israel’s military movements—it still failed to stop more than 100 Israeli Air Force planes as they hit deep inside the Islamic Republic. This was made possible in part by Israel’s initial strike on radar systems stationed in Syria, essentially leaving Tehran blind as Israeli planes flew more than 1,000 miles into Iranian airspace. Satellite imagery reviewed by the Associated Press showed extensive damage to sensitive Iranian military sites, including some previously linked to Tehran’s illicit nuclear weapons program. Other facilities targeted by the Israelis included manufacturing points for Tehran’s ballistic missile industry, which is responsible for fueling the two massive attacks on Israel this year that set the stage for Friday’s retaliatory operation. Iran says four military members were killed during the strike. Regional analysts believe Israel put up to half of its air force in the sky during the operation, with all pilots returning home unscathed. It was the largest direct attack on Iran in Israel’s history and followed years of covert operations meant to sabotage Tehran’s nuclear program, weapons facilities, and oil infrastructure. While the Biden-Harris administration pressured Israel to avoid most of those sites, hoping to ward off a wider regional war, Israel still proved that it can deal Iran a devastating blow. 'Israel fundamentally altered the battlefield in a positive way for the United States and close allies, not just for itself,' said Goldberg, who serves as a senior adviser to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. 'So many years of people telling us what Israel wasn’t capable of doing; so many years of people telling us what Israel just did would be so very challenging for us to do ourselves; so many assumptions reset inside the Beltway once again.' The Pentagon, Goldberg added, should immediately review 'its own assumptions and contingency planning' given the drastically different conditions on the ground in Iran following Israel’s unprecedented assault. As the scope and scale of Israel’s attack came into focus over the weekend, it became clear that Iran’s air defenses are now in tatters. Israel conducted a multi-wave attack that destroyed Tehran’s surface-to-air missile defenses, long portrayed as impenetrable by Iran. This most notably included Iran’s stock of S-300 missile defense systems, which were manufactured and provided by Russia. Israel then hit key military sites tied to the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile program, including in Tehran and the city of Karaj, where multiple explosions were reported. In addition to deploying American F-35 war planes, Israel used 'heavy munitions, long-distance strikes,' and advanced mid-air refueling capabilities to ensure all critical targets were hit, according to the Jerusalem Post. Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ran the operation from a high-tech underground bunker in Tel Aviv known as 'the pit.' The United States and several Arab nations were informed of the attack just before it was launched, according to the Wall Street Journal, which said 'officials in some of those countries then alerted Iran.' Israel says it is prepared for further strikes should Iran respond but signaled there is little appetite for a full-blown war, a position shared with Tehran’s leadership. 'The message is that we don’t want an escalation but if Iran decides to escalate and attack Israel again, this means that we have increased our range of freedom of movement in the Iranian skies,' an Israeli official told the Journal on Saturday, after the dust had settled. Iranian officials sought to downplay the strike over the weekend, with the country’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, reportedly saying during a Sunday cabinet meeting that Tehran 'is not seeking war but will defend its rights in the recent aggression of the criminal Zionist regime.' Iranian state-controlled media claimed 'the country’s air defense units intercepted a significant number of Israeli missiles and stopped its military aircraft from penetrating Iranian airspace,' though Western reports show this is untrue. Iran’s vice president, Mohammad Reza, promised Israel will 'receive an appropriate response,' but there were few indications on Sunday that Tehran is preparing a military reprisal. Privately, the Israeli counterstrike caused 'deep alarm' in Iran, the New York Times reported.

Mother’s calm in crisis linked to lower PTSD symptoms in children...	Mothers who effectively regulated their responses to threats were able to moderate the PTSD symptoms exhibited by their children. By Pesach Benson, TPS An Israeli study of families living at varying distances from the Gaza Strip found that a mother’s ability to regulate her response to stressful and threatening situations can significantly reduce the likelihood of her children developing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, researchers announced on Sunday. PTSD is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. People with PTSD may avoid situations or things that remind them of the traumatic event, and they may have negative changes in beliefs and feelings. In children under the age of six, PTSD symptoms often manifest through play that reenacts the traumatic experience or through frightening dreams. The study, led by Prof. Naama Atzaba-Poria of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, explored the relationship between PTSD symptoms in families living in southern Israel and the mothers’ capacity to regulate and mediate their children’s experiences during times of crisis. The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed Stress and Health journal. 'It seems that the mother’s ability to effectively monitor the relevant information in her environment and to inhibit more impulsive reactions, contributes to her ability to respond in a more reflective way, which sees her children’s needs and helps increase the sense of security, and thus she can create a safer place for them that promotes development,' Atzaba-Poria said. 'As a result, the children may feel more protected and, therefore, at a lower risk of developing PTSD symptoms,' she explained. 'In the clinical aspect and in day-to-day work, these results may be useful in identifying the families that may need more support and assistance under a threat and a complex security situation.' The study focused on families living at varying distances from the Gaza Strip, ranging from communities within 20 kilometers to those up to 40 kilometers away, all facing differing levels of exposure to security threats, such as rocket fire. Researchers surveyed 131 mothers and their firstborn children, aged 10-45 months, during the third trimester of pregnancy with a second child. The participating families, mainly from cities like Beer-Sheva, Sderot, and Ashkelon, faced varying degrees of exposure to security threats. To assess the impact of maternal behavior on child PTSD symptoms, the mothers completed computerized tasks measuring executive functions, including their ability to update working memory or inhibit responses irrelevant to the current situation. Additionally, they filled out online questionnaires designed to identify PTSD symptoms in both themselves and their children. The results indicated a significant link between a mother’s ability to mediate threatening situations and a reduction in PTSD symptoms among children. Specifically, mothers who effectively regulated their responses to threats were able to moderate the PTSD symptoms exhibited by their children. Prof. Atzaba-Poria explained that a mother’s ability to recognize and process pertinent information about the situation — for example, understanding a threat and swiftly taking her child to a safe area — enables her to mediate the event effectively for her child, while also regulating both her own and her child’s emotional responses. Interventions focusing on strengthening parental self-regulation could be a vital strategy in preventing PTSD in children. This approach could be incorporated into clinical practices, especially for families living in conflict zones, ensuring that support is not just child-focused but includes empowering parents to better handle trauma.

Dozens of terrorists were eliminated in Jabaliya in northern Gaza, where tunnel shafts were also neutralized and a large amount of weapons found, according to the military. By JNS A year and a day after launching ground operations against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces on Monday continued to engage terrorist forces across the coastal enclave. Troops were conducting targeted raids in the central and southern Gaza Strip, the Israel Defense Forces said on Monday morning, killing armed terrorists and dismantling Hamas infrastructure. כוחות אוגדה 91 ממשיכים לתקוף תשתיות טרור ולהחרים אמצעי לחימה של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה בדרום לבנון. במהלך היממה האחרונה, חטיבת האש של האוגדה זיהתה חוליית מחבלים בסמוך למבנה צבאי של חיזבאללה שהיוותה איום על כוחותינו, בסגירת מעגל מהירה ובשיתוף עם חיל האוויר החוליה חוסלה>> pic.twitter.com/aQ0DT2XldL &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) October 28, 2024 The IDF highlighted an incident in which soldiers detected terrorists inside a structure rigged with explosives and directed the Israeli Air Force to strike the building. Dozens of terrorists were also eliminated in Jabaliya in northern Gaza, where tunnel shafts were also neutralized and a large amount of weapons found, according to the military. Israeli forces are continuing efforts to evacuate non-combatants to safer areas, despite Hamas deliberately attempting to prevent them from doing so, the IDF said. As an example, civilians were allowed time to leave before the IDF conducted a precision strike against Hamas terrorists embedded inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalyia. According to the IDF, the terrorists who barricaded themselves inside the medical facility included those who participated in the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre of Israeli citizens in the northwestern Negev. During the operation, Israeli soldiers apprehended 100 terrorists from the compound, including terrorists who attempted to escape during the evacuation of civilians. Inside the hospital, soldiers found weapons, terror fund and intelligence documents. While the operation was taking place, the IDF said that the Gaza Coordination and Liaison Administration (CLA) coordinated with the hospital to ensure essential hospital services were maintained, including activating an additional generator, ensuring electricity and oxygen supply for patients. 'Throughout the war, Hamas terrorists have repeatedly operated from inside hospitals across the Gaza Strip, using them to hold hostages, execute terror attacks, and store weapons and explosives,' the IDF said. 'The IDF will continue to act in accordance with international law and act against the Hamas terrorist organization, while avoiding harm to civilians.' The IDF also provided video documentation of an ambulance driver from Kamal Radwan who testified that Hamas terrorists used the hospital to conduct activities. 'Hamas military operatives are present [in the Kamal Adwan Hospital]; they are in the courtyards, at the gates of the building, in the offices.'

Israeli laser defense set for 2025 deployment after $536 million ...	The Magan Or system is designed to intercept a wide range of aerial threats, including rockets, mortars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and cruise missiles. By Pesach Benson, TPS An Israeli laser-based air defense system under development is expected to become operational in mid-2025, the Israeli Defense Ministry said on Monday as it announced the signing of a 2 billion-shekel ($536 million) order to expand its production. The Magen Or system, more commonly referred to as 'Iron Beam,' is the laser equivalent of Israel’s better-known Iron Dome system. 'At the outbreak of the war, the Ministry of Defense signed hundreds of orders worth tens of billions of shekels, to strengthen the independence of blue and white production and to build the strength of the [Israel Defense Forces],' said Major General (Res.) Eyal Zamir, the Defense Ministry’s Director General. 'The ‘Magen Or’ deal is one of the most important deals we have signed, as it heralds the beginning of a new era on the battlefield – the laser era,' which Zamir said 'is expected to enter operational service in a year from today. The ‘Magan Or’ deal will ensure the continuation and acceleration of equipping many more laser systems.' The Magan Or system is designed to intercept a wide range of aerial threats, including rockets, mortars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and cruise missiles. The plan is to integrate Iron Beam into the Iron Dome system. In the future, an algorithm will determine whether to shoot down aerial threats with a laser or the Tamir interceptors. Iron Dome’s Tamir interceptor missiles reportedly cost around $50,000 apiece and require replenishing. However, the 100-kilowatt laser has a range of about eight to 10 kilometers (five to six miles), which is considerably shorter than that of Iron Dome. Each laser can engage a single threat at a time, unlike the Iron Dome, which can intercept multiple threats simultaneously. In 2022, then-prime minister Naftali Bennett said the system would 'bankrupt' Israel’s enemies. 'Until today, it cost us a lot of money to intercept each rocket. Today they can invest tens of thousands of dollars in a rocket and we will invest $2 on the electricity for intercepting that rocket,' Bennett said at the time. The Iron Dome system put Israel on the map with its ability to shoot down short-range threats such as rockets, missiles and mortars. It was first deployed in March 2011, and the following month, it scored its very first interception. The primary contractors for Iron Beam’s production are Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems, both based in Haifa. In January 2020, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced three different laser programs: A ground-based laser to supplement Iron Dome, a mobile system to protect military units during maneuvers and an aerial system capable of downing threats from above. The aerial version will give Israel the ability to use lasers against rockets above cloud cover. Israel’s multi-layered air defenses drew considerable international attention for intercepting a variety of ballistic and cruise missiles and drones launched by Iran and its proxies during the past year. The Arrow-3 system is capable of intercepting ballistic missiles in space. The system made its first interception when it shot down a ballistic missile fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The interception is widely believed to have taken place outside the earth’s atmosphere, which would make Israel the first country to shoot down a missile in space. But Israel has not confirmed that detail. Other layers of Israel’s air defense system include David’s Sling which is designed to shoot down medium-range threats at high altitudes, and the C-Dome system, designed to protect naval vessels from short-range threats.

Report: Frantic Hezbollah members deserting the organization in d...	Attacks on Hezbollah's leadership, bombings against thousands of operatives, and IDF's ground operation in southern Lebanon have crushed morale in the Iran-backed terror group, leading to mass desertions according to report. By World Israel News Staff Morale among operatives in the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah has plummeted in recent weeks, according to a report Sunday, following a string of targeted Israeli attacks against the organization's leadership, and the ongoing ground operation in southern Lebanon. The Arabic-language Elaph outlet published a report Sunday citing multiple sources who claim that Hezbollah is now facing large-scale desertions, as panicked operatives affiliated with the terror group attempt to distance themselves from Hezbollah to avoid attacks by Israel. According to the sources cited by the report, a growing number of Hezbollah operatives are no longer reporting to their handlers when summoned. In addition, a number of Hezbollah terrorists have fled Lebanon since Israeli forces entered southern Lebanon, and have sought sanctuary in Syria - and to avoid being called up by Hezbollah's leadership for combat missions against the IDF. The wave of desertions, which has hit Hezbollah hardest in southern Lebanon, has forced the terror group to dispatch reinforcements from other areas of the country. The sudden and dramatic loss of manpower, particularly on the southern front, has reportedly impaired Hezbollah's ability to communicate effectively with and direct its forces in some sectors of southern Lebanon. The drop in morale has also hampered Hezbollah's recruitment efforts, making it more difficult to replace terrorists who have been killed or wounded, or who have deserted. On September 17th and 18th, thousands of Hezbollah terrorists were injured when pagers and handheld radios exploded simultaneously, apparently part of an Israeli covert operation. The Shi'ite organization was rocked again on September 27th when its secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Nasrallah's heir apparent, Hashem Safieddine, head of Hezbollah's executive council, was killed just days later in another IDF airstrike in Beirut.

Hamas shields terrorists in hospitals, ambulances, says Gaza para...	Gaza ambulance driver arrested by Israel over his ties to Hamas admits that the terror group controls hospitals, using medical facilities and ambulances for military purposes. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization has embedded itself in the operations of medical centers in the Gaza Strip, and has commandeered much of the coastal enclave's ambulance system, using emergency vehicles to transport and shield terrorists, Hamas operatives captured by the IDF say. On Monday, the IDF released footage from the interrogation of a Gaza ambulance driver and paramedic linked to Hamas - one of multiple interrogations which the Israeli military says corroborates the accusations of the terror group's misuse of hospitals and ambulances. During the interrogation, recorded in October, the Hamas operative testified that the terror group had completely taken over the operation of the Kamal Adwan Medical Center in Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip. The IDF released the testimony a day after an airstrike hit the hospital, killing 40 and injuring over 80, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. Israel has claimed that the hospital was subverted by Hamas for military purposes. In the footage released by Israel's military, the ambulance driver said that 'Hamas members are present' throughout Kamal Adwan Medical Center. 'They are in the courtyards, at the gates of the buildings, in the offices of Kamal Adwan Hospital.' Ambulances, he continued, have been requisitioned for use not only as medical evacuation vehicles for terrorists, but also to ferry Hamas terrorists to and from attacks. 'They operate ambulances to transport their wounded military operatives, and to transport them for their missions, and this is instead of using the ambulances for the benefit of civilians.' 'We, the public in the northern Gaza Strip, are sick of this situation. We have had enough; they are stationed in the hospitals, stationed in the schools.' In a joint statement released by the IDF and Shin Bet internal security agency, Israeli security officials said that nearly 100 terrorist suspects were arrested in a raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital following Sunday's airstrike. The captured terrorists included a number who had taken part in the atrocities of October 7th, the statement said.

‘Unimaginable consequences’ – Iran threatens to escalate conflict...	Iranian foreign ministry accuses Israel of ‘genocidal war,’ says Tehran is prepared to respond with ‘all available tools.’ By World Israel News Staff The Iranian government threatened to escalate the ongoing conflict with Israel, saying Tehran is prepared to respond to Israeli retaliatory strikes conducted over the weekend. On Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei denounced Israel for its airstrikes on Iranian military positions Saturday, while hinting at further escalations. Over 100 Israeli air force jets struck Iranian military positions across Iran, Syria, and Iraq Saturday morning, more than three weeks after Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel. At least four Iranian soldiers were killed in the Israeli reprisal. Baghaei told reporters Monday that Iran 'will use all available tools to deliver a definite and effective response to the Zionist regime,' without elaborating on Tehran’s plans. According to the official Iranian state media outlet IRNA, Baghaei said Iran 'reserves the right to respond' to Israeli 'aggression in accordance with international law.' Israel’s attacks on Iran over the weekend were grave 'miscalculation by Israel,' Baghaei added, while accusing Israel of conducting a 'genocidal war in occupied Palestine' and 'genocide and crimes' in Lebanon. Hossein Salami, chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, also alluded to possible reprisals by Iran on Israel for Saturday’s retaliatory strikes. Israel, Salami said on Monday, 'failed to achieve its ominous goals,' calling the strikes a sign of 'miscalculation and helplessness. Salami added that the 'bitter consequences' for Israel 'will be unimaginable.' A day earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the United States for supporting Israel, blaming Washington for Saturday’s airstrikes. 'The Americans’ partnership in Israel’s operation is quite clear for us,' Araghchi said. 'The least they did was to provide Israel’s air force with a space corridor, and also, the defense equipment they earlier delivered to Israel is, in a way, considered complicity in this operation against Iran.' 'We maintain that the US partnership in Israel’s crimes and escalation of tension in West Asia is quite clear and Washington bears responsibility for it.'

Lebanese MP: Israel defeated Hezbollah, ‘it’s over’ for terror gr...	As a regional power? Bye-bye, it’s over,' says Druze MP of terror group. By World Israel News Staff A Lebanese parliamentarian declared that Hezbollah has been defeated by Israel, adding that the terror group is no longer relevant as a political or military force in Lebanon. Mark Daou, an independent Druze politician, recently spoke out about Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah on a Lebanese talk show. 'It appears now that Hezbollah, as a military force, is finished,' Daou said, according to a translation of his remarks by blogger Abu Ali Express. He said that the success of the Israeli ground invasion of southern Lebanon demonstrated that Hezbollah had been defanged. The fact that Hezbollah has failed to expel Israeli troops from the region demonstrates the terror group’s weakness, he said. 'We see the videos, how Israel brought in intensional reporters and showed them around Lebanese territory,' Daou continued. The Israelis 'hold territory so well that they’re already hosting guests,' he added. Hezbollah 'no longer exists as a military force,' the MP emphasized. 'As a regional power? Bye-bye, it’s over.' Daou's remarks come on the heels of a recent report that Hezbollah is struggling with mass desertions, following the slaying of the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. According to Arabic-language news outlet Elaph, widespread defections have hindered Hezbollah's ability to continue attacking Israel. Some Hezbollah terrorists are fleeing to Syria with their families, while others are failing to report to their assigned stations. Hezbollah is also struggling to recruit new terrorists to replace those killed or severely maimed in battle against IDF troops. Due to the amount of Hezbollah terrorists who have abandoned their posts in southern Lebanon following the Israeli ground invasion, Hezbollah has been forced to send reinforcements to what was once a major stronghold for the group. While the desertions are primarily concentrated to southern Lebanon, senior Hezbollah officials fear that the defections could spread to other parts of the country.

Iran blames US for Israeli retaliatory strikes	America 'complicit' in Israeli attacks, says Iranian foreign minister, saying Washington 'bears responsibility' after Israeli warplanes bombed Iran's missile defense network. By World Israel News Staff Iran blamed the United States on Sunday for a series of Israeli airstrikes Saturday, calling Washington 'complicit.' Over 100 Israeli jet fighters struck military targets across Iran on Saturday, including in Tehran, and the Ilan and Khuzestan provinces. In addition, Israeli jets struck Iranian positions in Syria and Iraq. At least four Iranian soldiers were killed in the strikes, which came in retaliation for the October 1st ballistic missile attacks by Iran on Israel, in which over 180 missiles were launched. A day after Israel's retaliatory strikes, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi linked the United States to the attacks in a televised address. 'The Americans' partnership in Israel's operation is quite clear for us,' Araghchi said. Iran's foreign affairs chief said that Tehran holds Washington 'responsible' for the Israeli reprisals, and claimed that Israel would be powerless in the region were it not for support from the United States. 'The least they did was to provide Israel's air force with a space corridor, and also, the defense equipment they earlier delivered to Israel is, in a way, considered complicity in this operation against Iran.' 'We maintain that the US partnership in Israel's crimes and escalation of tension in West Asia is quite clear and Washington bears responsibility for it.' Araghchi said Iran blamed the U.S. not only for Israel's strikes on Iran on Saturday, but also for all Israeli military action against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip and against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Turning to his petition to the United Nations Security Council, calling on the council to hold an emergency session and to take action against Israel, Araghchi lamented that because of the American veto in the council, no decisive resolutions would likely be passed.

Left-wing lawmaker under fire for calling fallen Israeli soldier ...	The far leftist MK should also be fined heftily for calling Sgt. Maj. Shuvael Ben-Natan a 'criminal' and a 'monster,' says Zionist group Betzalmo. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An Israeli human rights group called Sunday for far-left MK Ofer Cassif to be suspended from the Knesset and fined a hefty sum for slandering an IDF soldier who recently fell in battle in Lebanon. Betzalmo head Shai Glick wrote an urgent letter to the Knesset Ethics Committee after Cassif, the only Jewish member of the Hadash-Taal party, went online to brand Sgt. Maj. Shuvael Ben-Natan as a 'criminal' and 'monster.' 'The time has come to put an end to incitement and slander against IDF soldiers,' Glick wrote. 'This is a serious blow to the honor of the fallen, his family and the IDF's heritage. It is inconceivable that a Knesset member will call a fallen soldier a 'monster' and spread inciting and false claims about him.' Glick demanded that the MK be suspended immediately and levied the maximum fine possible, NIS100,000, to send the message that such statements were unacceptable. Cassif had charged that 'At the funeral of a settler killed in Lebanon as a reserve soldier, his eulogizers praised him for murdering a 40-year-old Palestinian who was harvesting olives on his land, for seeking blood revenge and seeking to murder as many women and children as possible in Gaza, and for burning down a house there just for the fun of it.' 'Despite his criminal views and actions,' the MK continued, 'he was drafted and sent to Gaza and Lebanon where he was able to carry out his sickening ideas. Monsters like him are now sitting in the government and setting policies. It is not the security of Israel and its citizens that motivates them, but a disturbed and bloodthirsty messianism.' Ben-Natan’s brother had noted in his eulogy that the soldier had wanted to avenge the massacre Hamas had perpetrated on October 7, against 'everyone you saw,' while a fellow soldier described the 22-year-old as 'the biggest goofball in the platoon' who had set fire to a home against orders 'to boost morale.' Some 11 months ago, when Ben-Natan was on leave from the army, he went walking with his family near their Samarian home in Rehalim. A group of Palestinians surrounded them and began stoning them. Feeling their lives were in danger, he shot one of them, killing him. When army forces came, they arrested him but none of the Arabs, threw him in jail for two weeks, and he had to battle the authorities to allow him to return to his unit to fight in Gaza, and eventually, in Lebanon. On the way to eulogize Ben-Natan at his funeral last week, Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan said that he had been told that the case against Ben-Natan had finally been closed as the allegations against him were proven false, but as the soldier was still at the front he never found out that his name had been cleared. Glick told World Israel News that this was far from the first time Cassif had blackened the name of the IDF, and it was time he was punished for doing so. 'From the beginning, after the horrific massacre, Ofer Cassif has been working day and night on only one thing - to slander and harm the State of Israel and the IDF,' Glick said. 'He petitioned against Israel in The Hague [joining South Africa’s spurious charge that the IDF was committing genocide in Gaza], calls for the imposition of an arms embargo on Israel ,and repeatedly defames the soldiers of the IDF, the security forces and the members of the emergency response squads, calling them murderers and war criminals.' 'Yesterday he went even further and called a fallen soldier (!) a killer and a monster,' he added. 'This man belongs in prison a long time ago. But until then, the ethics committee has a clear obligation to kick him out of the Knesset and give him the highest fine.' After Cassif had supported South Africa’s lawsuit, 84 MKs voted to expel him from the legislature in February but this was six short of the 90 necessary and he remained in his position. Ben-Natan was killed along with three other members of his reserve Carmeli Brigade on Wednesday, after Hezbollah terrorists jumped out from a tunnel in a southern Lebanon village and threw grenades at the soldiers.

‘Trump sides with Israel, Harris sides with the terrorists’ – Rud...	Former New York City mayor blasts Democrats and Biden administration over handling of Israel's war against Hamas and Hezbollah, accusing them of siding with 'the terrorists.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani accused Democrats of siding with Hamas and Hezbollah against Israel, during a campaign rally in New York City on Sunday. Speaking at a Trump campaign event headlined by the former president, Giuliani took aim at the Biden administration over its handling of the war in Gaza and south Lebanon, claiming that while Republicans back Israel, Democrats are 'on the side of the terrorists.' 'September 11th was our darkest hour. October 7th was Israel's darkest hour. They are our best friend,' Giuliani said. 'I worked for Ronald Reagan for eight years. Ronald Reagan said we have to be there for Israel because they are are always there for us.' 'I'm on the side of Israel, you're on the side of Israel. Donald Trump's on the side of Israel. And they are on the side of the terrorists!' Giulani also warned that Palestinians are 'taught to kill' Americans, and accused Vice President Kamala Harris of working to bring Gazans to the United States, likely a reference to reports this year that the Biden administration is mulling granting refugee status to some Gazans. 'Hamas is not there for us, Iran is not there for us - they want to kill us,' Giuliani continued. 'And the Palestinians are taught to kill us at two years old.' 'They won't let a Palestinian in Jordan, they won't let a Palestinian in Egypt, and Harris wants to bring them to you.' 'They may be good people, I'm sorry, I don't take a risk with people that are taught to kill Americans at two.' Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (New York) also blasted the Biden administration and Harris over their record on Israel. 'A year ago, our most precious ally, Israel, was under attack from Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists,' Stefanik said at Sunday's gathering. Harris, Stefanik claimed, was 'turning her back on Israel.'

Iran’s missile program set back, but nuclear threat remains	The damage to Iran’s missile production sites is currently unknown, but might also slow down Tehran’s efforts to replenish and upgrade its ballistic missile arsenal, degrading a key component of Iran’s military strategy. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS Israel’s airstrikes on military targets in Iran overnight Friday damaged the Islamic Regime’s missile program and air defenses, while demonstrating the Israeli Air Force’s advanced long-range capabilities. However, Iran’s nuclear program was left unscathed, suggesting that Israel’s government factored in U.S. pressure to keep the attack limited in nature. The question going forward is whether the damage to Iran’s missile and air defense infrastructure have paved the way for future strikes. Iranian state media has reported that targets were hit in three main regions: Tehran, Khuzestan (in southwest Iran) and Ilam (western Iran). The attack, which Israel named 'Operation Days of Repentance,' saw tens of IAF jets, accompanied by refuelers, travel some 1,600 kilometers from Israeli territory. The IAF achieved near uncontested aerial supremacy in Iranian skies. While Iranian state media is playing down the impact, the attack at the very least demonstrated Israel’s ability to strike deep in Iranian territory and conduct complex, multi-wave operations without sustaining losses. Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Hezi Halevi commanded the operation from IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv, alongside IAF Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar. According to the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit, the mission was successful, with all aircraft returning safely. Following the strikes, Reuters cited a senior Biden administration official as saying that while Washington 'was prepared to respond to any Iranian retaliation, President Joe Biden anticipated that Iran would not escalate the situation.' This aligns with a broader pattern of U.S. pressure on Israel to avoid direct attacks against Iran’s nuclear program, especially with U.S. elections just days away and amid ongoing diplomatic efforts by the U.S. aimed to avoid direct American involvement in a war against Iran. As such, the attack was not only a military maneuver by Israel, but also a diplomatic one. By avoiding a direct confrontation over the nuclear issue, the Iranian regime was given the opportunity to de-escalate. The immediate tactical question following the operation is whether Israel’s strikes have sufficiently degraded Iran’s missile and air defense capabilities to influence future engagements. If Iran’s air defense network was significantly weakened, Israel may have an advantage in any potential follow-up operation. The fact that the operation spanned several hours, with multiple waves of attacks, suggests a sustained and methodical effort to diminish Iran’s military response capabilities. The damage to Iran’s missile production sites is currently unknown, but might also slow down Tehran’s efforts to replenish and upgrade its ballistic missile arsenal, degrading a key component of Iran’s military strategy. The key strategic question now is whether Israel anticipates a 'Stage B.' While the recent strikes achieved tactical gains, Israel’s decision not to engage Iran’s nuclear facilities suggests that a future attack might hinge on Iran’s response or any perceived shift by Iran to break out to a nuclear bomb. If the recent strike has indeed undermined Iran’s air defenses and missile capabilities, Israel might find a second wave—targeting more sensitive or strategically crucial sites—logistically simpler. Yet Iran’s nuclear advancements continue. According to Sima Shine, director of the Iran and the Shi’ite Axis Research Program at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, within two to three weeks, Iran can enrich enough uranium for three nuclear devices. The parallel effort of creating a nuclear warhead, she told JNS this month, would take more time, though she noted Iran could also decide to just create a bomb without a missile warhead. 'We’re talking about roughly six months to a year and a half,' she said. 'What is needed is a political decision' on Tehran’s part. In light of these developments, the focus on missile production and air defenses suggests Israel is playing a longer game, seeking to degrade Iran’s immediate military threat while leaving room for future strikes. 'Operation Days of Repentance' thus stands as a calculated maneuver, but one that leaves open critical questions about what comes next, and whether Israel has set the stage for a more decisive confrontation with Iran’s nuclear program.

US Democratic Senator: ‘Why are people criticizing Israel? They s...	Senator Fetterman praised the exploding beeper incident 'because it targeted for members of Hezbollah. You know, no one uses beepers in that situation other than they were a member of Hezbollah.' By JNS Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) defended his statement that he loved Israel’s attack on Hezbollah pagers in a recent interview with the New York Times. 'It was targeted for members of Hezbollah,' the pro-Israel Democrat said. 'You know, no one uses beepers in that situation other than they were a member of Hezbollah.' The interviewer noted that a young child was killed. 'Unfortunately, tragically, because Daddy was a member of Hezbollah. He brought that danger and evil into their home,' Fetterman said. 'That’s what tragically resulted in that poor child’s death, and that’s what’s so terrible. She paid the price because her father was a terrorist for Hezbollah.' Fetterman added that he thinks a two-state solution is an ideal but isn’t sure any longer that one is possible. The Times interviewer asked Fetterman about the 'nuance' about the 'price' being paid in innocent life in Gaza. Fetterman said 'there isn’t any nuance.' 'You think that the price that’s been paid is fair?' the interviewer asked. 'The price is terrible. It’s awful. That’s history and that’s war, and Israel was forced to fight an enemy that are cowardly,' he said. 'They hide in tunnels. They hide in schools and in refugee camps, and they’re in those kinds of places.' 'That forces them to reach them—they have to go through these civilians,' Fetterman said. 'That’s why they’re so evil, and that’s why that’s designed—the death and destruction and the misery, was designed by Hamas. They understood that that’s going to happen. They don’t care.' 'Some people blame Israel,' the senator said. 'Well, I blame Hamas.' The interviewer asked Fetterman to comment on Netanyahu’s leadership. The senator responded that it is 'really curious' that many Democrats decided they couldn’t criticize Israel, so instead they went after Netanyahu. 'You can think he’s a bad leader or a bad person or anything, but that happens to be the democratically-leader of Israel, and he’s on our side,' Fetterman said. 'That’s our ally, and if you had to pick who you want to criticize, you should be criticizing Hamas. You should be calling out Iran, or you should be calling out Hezbollah. Certainly not our ally.' Fetterman added that there are 'idiots in this nation' who chant 'from the river to the sea.' 'A least own your antisemitism rather than trying to hide behind a turn on words,' he said.

Egypt proposes 2-day hostage-for-prisoner exchange as first step ...	al-Sisi revealed that the preliminary deal would release four hostages to Israel in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News At the resumption of negotiations in Qatar, Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi proposed a 2-day initial hostage-for-prisoner exchange intended to lead to a more general captive release and ceasefire plan. On Sunday, al-Sisi revealed that the preliminary deal would release four hostages to Israel in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. At a press conference attended by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, al-Sisi expressed hopes that the initial hostage release would lead to an extensive and final deal. Although neither Israel nor Hamas has yet commented on Egypt's proposal, a Palestinian official told Reuters, 'I expect Hamas would listen to the new offers, but it remains determined that any agreement must end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza.' For Israel's part, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a condition for a ceasefire is the realization of Israel's goals during the war, namely to eliminate Hamas's political and military control of Gaza. The Saudi network Asharq reported that Hamas plans to propose a 'comprehensive deal to end the war immediately' which will demand the complete withdrawal of the IDF before the hostages are released. A Hamas official explained their version of a deal 'would end the war once and for all, and would include a prisoner swap where all Israeli hostages are released in exchange for an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons' and added that without the end of the war 'there will be no deal.' Mossad director David Barnea along with CIA director William Burns have congregated in Doha with Qatari and Egyptian mediators to seek an end to the year-long war in Gaza and to solidify a deal that would release hostages Hamas captured on October 7th. Barnea has been working on a new framework for a hostage release deal which will be adjusted to include some points from the Egyptian plan. Hamas has rejected a deal put forward by Mossad chief David Barnea that would allow immunity and safe passage for Hamas terrorists in exchange for the hostages in Gaza, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. David Barnea met with Egyptian officials last week, but Hamas rejected the proposal.

Iran jails citizens for filming its military humiliation	Iran’s crackdown on information sharing comes as details of Saturday’s early morning Israeli strikes remain uncertain. By Jewish Breaking News Iran is threatening to jail any citizens who share footage of Israel’s strikes, with authorities warning that distributing images or information to 'hostile media affiliated with the Zionist regime could result in sentences ranging from one to 10 years in prison,' reports the Telegraph. Despite the Islamic regime’s strict censorship laws, many Iranians continue to circumvent restrictions using VPNs, enabling access to social media platforms where footage of missiles flying over Tehran has been circulating. Iran’s crackdown on information sharing comes as details of Saturday’s early morning Israeli strikes remain uncertain. What is known is that the attacks targeted air defense systems and missile production facilities across Iran, though the precise number of targets and extent of damage have not been disclosed by the IDF. Notably, there are no credible reports of Iranian air defenses successfully intercepting any Israeli missiles during the operation, nor of fighter jets being scrambled to counter the threat. While the Islamic Republic’s establishment attempts to downplay the strikes as ineffective and praise Iran’s air defenses, the regime faces mounting pressure from hardliners demanding retaliation. However, Iran’s response options appear limited. Having already launched hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel twice this year with minimal impact, and lacking an effective air force, the country’s retaliatory capabilities are largely restricted to medium-range ballistic missiles of uncertain accuracy. According to Iran International, while the Islamic Republic possesses approximately 3,000 missiles at its disposal, the core issue isn’t weapon availability but rather Iran’s vulnerability to Israeli counterstrikes. Any significant retaliation could prompt Israel to target critical economic infrastructure, particularly Iran’s domestic oil refineries. The destruction of even one of Iran’s two major refineries could trigger serious domestic problems as winter approaches. Furthermore, Iran’s traditional strategy of confronting Israel through its terror proxies has also shown signs of weakening. Both Hezbollah and Hamas have been significantly degraded by recent Israeli operations, with Hezbollah unable to launch the massive rocket barrages that many analysts feared could overwhelm Israeli air defenses. document.createElement('video'); The post Iran jails citizens for filming its military humiliation appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/iran-jails-citizens-for-filming-its-military-humiliation/	2024-10-27T10:50:29-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IAF-female-pilot.png
Trump campaign ad features Holocaust survivor rebutting Harris’ ‘...	Both campaigns are fighting for Jewish voters who make up significant constituencies in multiple swing states. By Philissa Cramer, JTA A new campaign ad for Donald Trump pushes back against Kamala Harris’ claim that the former president is a 'fascist' by featuring a Holocaust survivor who says Harris is disgracing his murdered family members with the allegation. 'Adolf Hitler invaded Poland when I was 9 years old. He murdered my parents and most of my family,' says 94-year-old Jerry Wartski, an Auschwitz survivor and retired New York City real estate investor in the ad released Friday. 'I know more about Hitler than Kamala will ever know in a thousand lifetimes. For her to accuse President Trump of being like Hitler is the worst thing I’ve ever heard in my 75 years living in the United States,' Wartski continues. 'I know President Trump, and he would never say this. And Kamala Harris knows it. She owes my parents and everybody else who was murdered by Hitler an apology for repeating this lie.' The ad follows a mounting discourse about the use of the term 'fascist' in the presidential race. The discourse accelerated last week after The Atlantic reported that Trump had reportedly expressed admiration for Hitler’s generals. Harris applied the label to Trump herself for the first time during a CNN town hall meeting Wednesday night. Asked whether she believed Trump was a fascist, she answered, 'Yes, I do.' She also said Americans believe in democracy and 'not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.' The ad is meant to rebut the criticism at a pivotal time. An ABC poll released Friday found that half of registered voters consider Trump a fascist, suggesting that the concern could play a meaningful role in the Nov. 5 election. The poll, conducted before the most recent headlines, found that about 8% of voters planned to vote for Trump despite believing that he was a fascist. Contrary to Wartski’s suggestion in the video, Trump has referred to Harris as a fascist multiple times in the past. The poll also found that one in five voters would apply the label to Harris. Wartski’s deployment in the campaign ad reflects the particular resonance of fascism for Jewish voters given fascism’s strong historical association with Hitler and the Nazis, and the degree to which Jewish ideas and concerns are playing a central role in the presidential race in its final days. Both campaigns are fighting for Jewish voters who make up significant constituencies in multiple swing states. Wartski, a retired New York City real estate entrepreneur, is a registered Republican who has donated extensively to national Republicans, including Trump, and to local Democratic politicians, according to campaign finance records. Earlier this month, he accompanied Trump on a visit to the Rebbe’s Ohel, the Queens gravesite of the last Chabad-Lubavitch rabbi. In the ad, Wartski, rolling up his sleeve to show a number tattooed on his arm, is asked by a voice off-screen, 'Why should the Jewish people support President Trump?' He answers: 'Because he’s a mensch. I believe that President Trump is definitely going to be good for Israel, because in everything he’s done up to now was in favor. He’s never double-crossed anyone, and he never showed any weakness. … He has always stood with the Jewish people and the state of Israel.' (The ad is not the first to employ the word 'mensch,' Yiddish for a decent and upstanding person, in a presidential campaign, though it is the first to come from a candidate’s campaign. In 2020, the Jewish Democratic Council of America promoted Joe Biden as a 'mensch in the White House.') Until recently, Wartski — the honorary president of the Israel Heritage Foundation advocacy group, which last year honored Trump by giving him a silver Torah crown. Wartski also drew attention more recently as the landlord of a Manhattan table tennis club whose operator, Wang Chen, credits him with facilitating her success in the sport. Wartski gave his first-ever interview about his Holocaust experience in 2020 to Fox News, when he and his family traveled to Auschwitz to mark the 75th anniversary of its liberation. He described narrowly evading death for two years in two ghettos — first in his hometown of Osjakow, Poland, and then in the bigger city of Lodz — before his family was sent to Auschwitz. His mother, Esther, was murdered there, while his father, Jacob, died of starvation after a forced march just before Allied troops arrived. Wartski and his brother survived and spent years in Displaced Persons camps — where he said he first encountered ping-pong — before being allowed into the United States in 1949. He said he had not told his children about his experience but had reconsidered as he reached 90. 'Now I see that there are not a lot of people left who can tell the story,' Wartski said at the time. 'The stories that you hear are just unreal and unbelievable, and you have to talk.' 94-year-old Holocaust survivor decries Kamala & Co.'s claim that 'Trump is Hitler' Jerry Wartski, a 94-year-old survivor of Auschwitz, was 9 years old in 1939 when Hitler invaded Poland, 'murdered my parents and most of my family.'

Federal judge orders Virginia to reinstate noncitizens on voter r...	​​Virginia’s attorney general, Jason Miyares condemned the judge’s order. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon A federal judge on Friday ordered Virginia to reinstate 1,600 noncitizen voter registrations that Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R.) removed this year in an effort to disqualify illegal noncitizens from voting in the November election. U.S. district judge Patricia Giles, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, granted the Department of Justice's request for an injunction against the state, citing evidence submitted in court that some individuals removed from the rolls were eligible voters, the Associated Press reported. Youngkin, however, argued against the judge’s ruling, saying the individuals who were removed 'self-identified themselves as noncitizens.' 'Let’s be clear about what just happened: only eleven days before a Presidential election, a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate over 1,500 individuals—who self-identified themselves as noncitizens—back onto the voter rolls,' Youngkin said. 'Almost all these individuals had previously presented immigration documents confirming their noncitizen status, a fact recently verified by federal authorities.' ​​Virginia’s attorney general, Jason Miyares, also condemned the judge’s order. 'It should never be illegal to remove an illegal voter,' he said. 'Yet, today a Court—urged by the Biden-Harris Department of Justice—ordered Virginia to put the names of noncitizens back on the voter rolls, mere days before a presidential election,' he wrote in a statement. Miyares added that the Biden-Harris administration was working to 'weaponize the legal system against the enemies of so-called progress,' calling the case 'bullying, pure and simple.' Youngkin and Miyares both said Virginia plans to appeal the ruling and take the case all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. Youngkin announced on Aug. 7 that election officials had removed 6,303 noncitizens from the state’s voter rolls since January 2022. The DOJ then sued the state earlier this month for removing some of those voters from rolls 'too close to the Nov. 5 general election,' which it said violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993.

‘We have not broken’: Israel marks anniversary of October 7 attac...	Israeli President Isaac Herzog called on the government to capitalize on the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to bring home the remaining hostages being held in Gaza. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Israeli leaders stressed national unity, strength and resilience as the country marked the anniversary of the October 7 attacks on Sunday. The state ceremony, at Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl cemetery, came one after Israel’s Air Force struck targets in Iran on Saturday. 'We are in the midst of a long and difficult existential war, a war that exacts painful prices from us. We are all determined to continue the fight against those who seek our lives, and we will continue to pursue the murderers and their agents to the end,' said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'We suffered a severe blow, but we have not broken. Immense pain has struck us, but we have not disintegrated. We retaliated fiercely, and we have been doing so ever since… A war of annihilation has been imposed upon us, and we are responding with a war of revival,' Netanyahu insisted. 'This is an existential war – a war on seven fronts against the axis of evil led by Iran. The Air Force attacked throughout Iran, and we have dealt a severe blow to Iran’s defense capabilities and its ability to produce missiles,' he added. The airstrikes are reported to have damaged Iranian military bases, air defense systems, and factories associated with the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile and drone programs. Thursday, the Hebrew anniversary of the massacre, coincides with the holiday of Simchat Torah. The commemoration was delayed to Sunday so as not to conflict with the Sabbath. Israeli President Isaac Herzog called on the government to capitalize on the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to bring home the remaining hostages being held in Gaza. 'The critical, supreme task still lies ahead of us — to urgently bring back the hostages from the hands of the murderers,' Herzog said. 'The elimination of the arch-terrorist Sinwar and other enemies, and the impressive fighting by the IDF and security forces, have created an opportunity that we must not miss.' Sinwar was killed in a chance encounter with Israeli soldiers in Rafah on October 16 'Recent days have again reminded us of the heavy and painful price of war; so many families have joined the circle of bereavement, stricken with grief and sorrow, and the heart of the entire nation breaks again and again,' Herzog added. 'But even when the campaign is tough, one thing is clear: the only way to endure these difficult days is together, with a deep belief in the justness of our path,' he stressed. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant acknowledged the loss Israel experienced this year while highlighting the military’s achievements. 'In this year, we have dealt significant blows to our enemies and created a different security reality around us. But the prices are heavy – very heavy. Eight hundred and ninety-eight fallen have opened wounds in the heart of the nation. Our finest sons and daughters, IDF fighters and security forces have fallen since October 7 until today,' Gallant said. The near-destruction of Hamas and the deterioration of Hezbollah’s power, the Defense Minister said, 'Create a shift in the balance of power between Israel and its enemies, allowing us, at the political level, to realize the war’s objectives and make decisions from a position of strength and deterrence, in order to achieve a different reality in the Middle East.' After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Iran’s ‘supreme leader’ seriously ill—report	There is internal turmoil over the possibility that his second son, Mojtaba, 55, might succeed him. By JNS The 85-year-old supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is gravely ill, adding to the uncertainty of an Iranian response to Israel’s weekend attack on their military installations, a report published Saturday in The New York Times said. According to the report, the most powerful political authority in the Islamic Republic is seriously ill, and there is internal turmoil over the possibility that his second son, Mojtaba, 55, might succeed him. The younger Khamenei served in the Iran–Iraq War from 1987 to 1988, and reportedly took control of the militia that was used to suppress the protests surrounding the result of the 2009 elections, which demonstrators said was rigged. His prospects for the position rose following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash earlier this year and replacement by President Masoud Pezeshkian. Khamenei’s father has held the life position for the last 35 years since his appointment in 1989, following the death of the first supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini with whom he was closely allied, making him the longest-serving head of state in the Middle East.

Seven ‘friendly’ nations demand Israel allow pro-Hamas UN agency ...	Foreign ministers from seven countries call on Israel not to pass legislation banning UNRWA. By World Israel News Staff The foreign ministries of seven different countries criticized upcoming legislation in the Israeli Knesset, aimed at barring a United Nations agency from operating inside Israel. Israel's parliament is slated to vote Monday on a bill, backed by both Coalition and Opposition lawmakers, which if passed would ban the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East from operating in Israel, and would prohibit Israeli government agencies and employees from cooperating with or contacting UNRWA. The Knesset has sanctioned UNRWA following accusations that the agency employed a number of members of terrorist organizations, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. UNRWA has further been accused of employing Gazans who took part in the invasion of Israel on October 7th along with atrocities committed against Israelis. Earlier this year, the Israel Land Authority seized UNRWA's headquarters, located in Jerusalem near the Ma'alot Dafna neighborhood, and is according to the ILA website preparing to convert the complex into a housing development. The United States and United Nations have decried Israel's measures against UNRWA, calling on Jerusalem not to take punitive steps against the agency. Over the weekend, the foreign ministries of Japan, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Australia, and South Korea issued a joint statement urging Israel not to outlaw UNRWA. 'We&#8230; express our grave concern over legislation currently under consideration by the Israeli Knesset, aimed at revoking the privileges and immunities of&#8230;UNRWA, forbidding any contact between Israeli state entities, officials and UNRWA, and prohibiting any UNRWA presence within Israel.' 'We urge the Israeli Government to abide by its international obligations, keep the reserve privileges and immunities of UNRWA untouched and live up to its responsibility to facilitate full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance in all its forms as well as the provision of sorely needed basic services to the civilian population.' On Sunday, the Im Tirtzu organization in Israel called on Knesset members to pass the law barring UNRWA from operating in Israel, rejecting pressure from abroad. 'We don't give in to pressure,' Im Tirtzu said in a statement. 'We trust the elected officials to keep their word and show courage in the face of pressure. Coalition Chairman Ofir Katz and Knesset Chairman Amir Ohana - the entirety of Israel is watching. Don't be afraid, pass the laws to remove UNRWA.' David Lammy, foreign secretary for Britain's Labour government, issued his own statement expressing 'grave concerns' regarding Israel's proposed law.

‘No more Gaza war’ – Anti-Israel hecklers interrupt Kamala Harris...	We must end that war,' says Kamala Harris, agreeing with hecklers who chanted 'No more Gaza war' during her speech at a campaign rally in Kalamazoo, Michigan. By World Israel News Staff Anti-Israel hecklers interrupted Vice President and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' speech during a campaign stop in Michigan on Saturday, demanding an immediate end to the war between Israel and the Hamas terror organization. Harris rallied supporters at an event in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Saturday, just nine days before election day, amid polling showing the battleground state a dead heat between Harris and former President Donald Trump, who leads Harris in the RealClearPolitics average of polls by a razor-thin 0.2-point margin. Former First Lady Michelle Obama appeared onstage alongside the vice president to introduce her to the crowd, welcoming her to 'Kamala-zoo' Michigan. After Harris took the podium to address the gathering, a group of anti-Israel hecklers interrupted her speech, shouting 'No more Gaza war!' One man shouting at Harris called the vice president a 'piece of sh**.' Harris responded to the chants, appearing to agree with the noisy protests. 'Listen: On the topic of Gaza, we must end that war,' said Harris. 'And we must end the war and bring the hostages home. But now I am speaking about 2024. Alright.' A dozen or so anti-Israel protesters demonstrated outside Harris' Kalamazoo rally, marching and chanting that President Joe Biden and Harris 'cannot hide.' With fifteen electoral votes, Michigan is critical to Harris' prospects in the November 5th election. Trump narrowly won the state in 2016, while Biden flipped Michigan, winning the state by a comfortable 2.7-point margin. Since October 2023, however, support for the Biden-Harris administration has faltered among Michigan's roughly half-a-million Arab Americans. Traditionally staunch Democrats, some Arab Americans have expressed frustration with the White House's policies vis-a-vis the war in Gaza, with calls by groups including the Uncommitted National Movement to impose a truce on Israel.

Arab-Israeli woman seriously injured in Hezbollah attack days aft...	Hezbollah rocket barrage on northern Israel leaves Arab-Israeli woman seriously injured, days after rocket attack by the Lebanese terror group killed two Arab-Israelis. By World Israel News Staff An Arab-Israeli woman was seriously injured in a rocket attack Sunday afternoon, after the Lebanon-based Hezbollah terror organization pummeled northern Israel with dozens of rockets. As fighting continues between IDF forces and Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon, the Iran-backed terror group launched roughly 75 projectiles towards northern Israel. At least one rocket struck the Arab town of Tamra in the western Galilee at approximately 1:00 p.m., hitting a building and sparking a fire and damaging nearby cars. A woman was seriously injured in the attack, after she was struck by shrapnel. Two days earlier, two people were killed in a Hezbollah rocket attack on another Arab town in northern Israel. On Friday, Hezbollah terrorists launched at least 30 rockets at northern Israel, the IDF said, with one rocket striking a minimart in the Arab town of Majd al-Krum, located just four miles northeast of Tamra. Two people were critically injured in the attack, with both succumbing to their injuries. The victims killed in the attack were identified as 19-year-old Arjwan Manaa, and 21-year-old Hassan Suad. Both were in the minimart at the time of the attack, with Manaa working as a cashier, while Suad was a customer. In a separate rocket attack, at least six IDF soldiers were injured when a projectile launched by Hezbollah struck near the town of Shomera in the western Galilee. The victims were listed in moderate and light condition.

Mass casualty attack: Terrorist kills 1, injures 35 Israelis in t...	Truck slams into bus stop killing one and injuring dozens of pedestrians north of Tel Aviv outside an IDF base, leaving victims trapped under vehicle. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Dozens of pedestrians were injured and one killed in a terrorist ramming attack in central Israel Sunday morning, when a truck slammed into a bus stop at a junction not far from an Israeli military base. The attack occurred at around 10:00 a.m. Israel time, when a truck travelling down Aharon Yariv Boulevard in the central Israeli city of Ramat HaSharon rammed a bus as passengers were getting off, and then continued on a struck a bus stop adjacent to a Cinema City movie theater by Glilot Junction, where an IDF base is located. At least 35 people were injured in the attack, one of them fatally. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the injured and evacuate them to local hospitals. According to an MDA spokesperson, 10 victims have been evacuated to Ichilov Medical Center in Tel Aviv, including four people in serious condition, two in moderate condition, and four in light condition. Fourteen others have been evacuated to Petah Tikva's Beilinson Medical Center, MDA added. MDA has reported that five victims are in serious condition, with seven in moderate condition and the rest listed in light condition. One seriously injured victim was declared dead by doctors after being evacuated to the hospital. United Hatzalah volunteer EMT Aharon Yaakobson, who was nearby and arrived first at the scene, paramedic Yaron Schiff, and EMTs Eliyah Tubul and Yair Porush reported that some of the victims were trapped underneath the terrorist's truck. 'It was a difficult scene with a truck, a bus, and pedestrians. We provided initial treatment at the scene to over 20 people (at this stage) who sustained varying degrees of injuries.' 'Some of them were rescued by fire crews in serious condition after being trapped under the truck. Members of United Hatzalah's Psychotrauma and Crisis Response Unit also provided assistance at the scene to people who suffered from emotional shock.' Authorities say the terrorist was shot and killed during the attack. He has been identified as Rami Nasrallah Natour, an Israeli Arab from the Arab Israeli town of Qalansawe, east of Netanya.

4 IDF reservists killed, 14 wounded in battle with Hezbollah terr...	Israeli reservists kill 3 Hezbollah terrorists in gun battle in southern Lebanon, while 4 soldiers were killed, with 14 more wounded. By Pesach Benson, TPS Four Israeli soldiers were killed and another 14 injured in a battle with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces said on Sunday. According to the IDF, reservists from the 8207th Battalion engaged Hezbollah terrorists in an unspecified southern Lebanese village. During an exchange of fire, three of the terrorists were killed. The army is investigating the details of the incident. The fallen soldiers were identified as 29-year-old platoon commander Cpt. (res.) Amit Chayut; 36-year-old deputy platoon commander Maj. (res.) Eliav Amram Abitbol; the battalion’s rabbi, 43-year-old Cpt. (res.) Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg; and 30-year-old Master Sgt. (res.) Gilad Elmaliach, 30. Of the 14 injured, five were listed in serious condition. Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli army disclosed that soldiers uncovered Hezbollah weapons buried near the border fence while airstrikes on the terror group’s stronghold in Beirut’s Dahiya district targeted weapons warehouses and factories. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Terrorist attack foiled near entrance to Jerusalem	On the heels of major ramming attack in central Israel that left dozens injured, second attack reported outside Jerusalem. By World Israel News Staff A Palestinian Arab terrorist was shot and killed after he attempted to run down and stab a group of Israeli soldiers near the northern entrance to Jerusalem on Sunday, an Israeli military spokesperson said. The abortive attack occurred just before 1:00 p.m. Sunday afternoon, while a group of IDF soldiers were conducting a counter-terror operation in the town of Hizme, just north of the Jerusalem neighborhood of Pisgat Ze'ev. During the attack, a terrorist driving towards a group of soldiers accelerated and attempted to run the soldiers down. After failing to hit any of the soldiers, the terrorist exited his vehicle, drew a knife, and ran towards the soldiers, attempting to stab them. The soldiers opened fire on the terrorist as he approached them, fatally wounding him. No Israeli security personnel were injured during the incident. The attack came just hours after a terrorist driving a truck rammed into a bus and an adjacent bus stop in the central Israeli city of Ramat HaSharon, near a Cinema City movie theater. At least 35 people were injured in the attack, including ten listed in serious condition, one of whom who is said to have suffered life-threatening injuries. United Hatzalah volunteer EMT Aharon Yaakobson, who was nearby and arrived first at the scene, paramedic Yaron Schiff, and EMTs Eliyah Tubul and Yair Porush reported that some of the victims were trapped underneath the terrorist's truck.

Why did an Russian government plane secretly land in Israel?	Hamas recently signaled that it would prioritize releasing two hostages with Russian citizenship still held in the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff A Russian government plane landed in Israel last Thursday, without announcements from either Moscow or Jerusalem, triggering questions about Russia's role in negotiations with the Hamas terror group and Iran. The plane landed last Thursday at Ben-Gurion Airport, on the last day of the Sukkot holiday, and no official explanation or information were provided regarding the likely visit by a Russian government delegation. Israeli media officials declined to answer media queries regarding the visit. Notably, Hezbollah ceased its virtually non-stop rocket and missile fire and drone launches during the entire time that the Russian plane was on the ground in Israel. The terror group then resumed its aerial bombardment once the plane had taken off to return to Moscow and was out of Israeli airspace. 'For several weeks, Russia has been trying to mediate between Iran and Israel. This can be understood from Putin's words, from meetings between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Bogdanov and the Israeli Ambassador to Russia,' Alex Tenzer, a Russian media expert, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'Russia is trying to protect its influence in the Middle East, which is weakening day by day due to the weakening of Iran.' In December 2023, three Israeli hostages with Russian citizenship were released by Hamas, in a deal between the terror group and Russia. That deal was completely independent of a hostage deal between the Israeli government and Hamas, which saw the return of dozens of captives kidnapped on October 7th, alongside with thousands of Palestinian terrorists from Israeli prisons. Last week, the deputy head of the Hamas politburo, Musa Abu Marzouk, was hosted by the Kremlin to discuss a potential hostage deal. Abu Marzouk, who is classified by the U.S. government as a 'specially designated global terrorist,' said that Hamas was willing to have Russia act as a negotiator. Hamas would 'prioritize releasing the two Russian citizen hostages' still held in the Strip, even before the release of women or injured captives, Abu Marzouk told Russian media.

Unique ‘Vulcan’ anti-drone cannon deployed in north	The cannon can reportedly shoot a staggering 6,000 rounds in just one minute, and has six 20mm barrels. By World Israel News Staff Hezbollah terrorists have launched hundreds of explosive drones at Israeli communities and military targets over the past year of fighting. Drones have proved a particularly tricky target for Israel's Iron Dome air defense system to intercept, as the UAVs fly at low altitudes - oftentimes, literally under the radar. Earlier in October, an explosive drone launched by Hezbollah struck Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea, underscoring the threat posed by this new type of warfare. Just days before that incident, a suicide UAV struck a Golani Brigade training base in northern Israel, killing four soldiers. But according to reports, Israel has now deployed a new weapon aimed at curbing the Hezbollah drone threat. The M61 Vulcan cannon is now operational along Israel's northern border, according to Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv. The cannon can reportedly shoot a staggering 6,000 rounds in just one minute, and has six 20mm barrels. While this particular cannon was manufactured by the Israeli Tamar Group, an older version of the M61 Vulcan was originally provided to Israel by the U.S. during the 1967 Yom Kippur War. However, Israel only began using the cannon during the 1982 First Lebanon War. According to Ma'ariv, the efficacy of the Vulcan cannon is unclear. Due to the hilly terrain of the northern border region, some IDF officials are concerned that the weapon may not be able to effectively shoot down drones. Several weeks ago, the Ministry of Defense issued an unusual statement calling on Israeli weapons manufacturers and technology companies to create or suggest a solution that can improve the IDF's ability to intercept UAVs. 'The Israel Air Force has not built a proper force to deal with drone threats on such a large scale, despite the significant successes in the North,' a senior reserve officer recently told Walla. 'It’s a fundamental issue. We ended up in a situation where four fighter jets and a missile ship – at best – are chasing one drone.'

CIA chief leads first ceasefire summit in months in bid to reboot...	With time running out for the Biden administration before next month's election, CIA Director William Burns set to lead first high-level ceasefire talks in months, hoping to reach breakthrough on hostage deal. By World Israel News Staff For the first time in months, officials involved in talks aimed at reaching a hostage deal and ceasefire in the Gaza Strip are set to gather for a summit in Doha, Qatar in a bid to reboot talks which have been deadlocked for much of the year. CIA Director William Burns, who is leading the American delegation, is set to lead the renewed hostage deal negotiations, the first high-level talks since August. Time is running out for the Biden administration to reach a breakthrough towards a deal prior to election day next Tuesday, or a final deal before inauguration day next January 20th. Since early on in Israel's war with Hamas, the White House has sought to secure the release of hostages abducted by Gaza terrorists on October 7th, as well as to achieve a lasting truce in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli delegation, headed by Mossad chief David Barnea, is expected to unveil a new plan, offering a framework for a deal drafted in conjunction with Qatari and Egyptian interlocutors. The summit comes following a whirlwind tour of the Middle East by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met with leaders from Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar last week. Blinken's Mideast trip and Sunday's summit come following the assassinations of high-level Hamas leaders, including politburo chief Yahya Sinwar. Following the killing of Sinwar, who staunchly opposed any concessions in hostage deal talks, the Biden administration resumed efforts to bring Hamas back to the negotiating table. However, it is unclear if Burns will continue to push President Joe Biden's framework for a deal, laid out by the president in May when he proposed a three-phase agreement - or formally embrace the new plan drafted by Israel, Egypt, and Qatar, with input from the U.S. Israel has sought to shift talks from a narrow focus on the Gaza war to include a comprehensive ceasefire with both Hamas and Hezbollah - a move which could then increase pressure by Hezbollah and Iran on Hamas to make concessions to Israel.

Israel crippled Iran’s primary missile defense system in strikes,...	Several major energy sites, a missile base, a port and Tehran’s international airport are now defenseless, leaving Tehran on edge. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF destroyed Iran's most advanced anti-missile systems among the air defenses it hit in its overnight air attack Saturday, leaving several major energy sites, a missile base, a port and Tehran’s airport defenseless, The New York Times reported Sunday. Citing unnamed Israeli officials, the paper said that three S-300 systems supplied by Russia and other radar systems were 'severely damaged and rendered inoperative.' A fourth one had been demolished in the single strike Israel had delivered in April after Iran fired some 300 cruise and ballistic missiles and drones at the Jewish state in an attack that failed to do more than cause some minor damage and injured a Bedouin girl. The S-300 is Russia’s second-most powerful air defense system; it did not sell any of its top-of-the-line S-400s to the Islamic Republic. The protective systems nailed by the three waves of Israeli jets included those near the Bandar Imam Khomeini port and Iran’s largest petrochemical complex of the same name, which is adjacent to it, Iranian officials told the paper. The airstrike also took out the air defense around Iran’s largest oil refinery, which produces 360,000 barrels a day. A gas refinery, the Malad missile base near the capital, and Tehran’s international airport have also been denuded of their most advanced shields. In all, some 140 IAF jets and UAVs struck throughout several provinces, some deep in the country. Three important missile manufacturing facilities run by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, launch sites, and vital components of Iran’s ballistic missile program were all targeted in a careful mission that stuck to military sites. The United States had warned Israel against hitting the mullahcracy’s economic lifeline – its gas and oil fields – or its nuclear facilities, believing Tehran’s many warnings that such attacks could cause a regional war. Upon concluding its successful mission, the IDF in turn warned Tehran Saturday that if it decides to escalate matters, it has shown its capabilities and stands ready to attack again. The Iranians may have gotten the point. 'Israel is sending a clear message to us,' said Hamid Hosseini, an expert on Iran’s oil and gas industry and a member of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce. 'This can have very serious economic consequences for Iran, and now that we understand the stakes we need to act wise and not continue the tensions.' The strike Saturday was Israel’s response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack on the Jewish state earlier this month which caused hundreds of millions of shekels in damages to homes, businesses, and managed to hit certain military bases, although not critically.

Sid Rosenberg’s explosive trip to Israel: What you didn’t hear	New York's #1 radio broadcaster's message is clear: Israel’s future hangs in the balance, and we must stand with our greatest ally now, more than ever. By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News On the one-year anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attacks, Sid Rosenberg returned to Israel—not merely as New York's #1 radio broadcaster, but as a man on a mission. This trip wasn’t about another news cycle; it was about witnessing firsthand the daily fight for survival in a nation under siege. With exclusive interviews from two of the world’s most prominent leaders—former President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—Rosenberg brought home a message that Americans need to hear: the fight for Israel’s survival is more critical than ever, and it demands unwavering U.S. support. Trump’s Uncompromising Support for Israel In his interview with Rosenberg, Donald Trump reminded his audience why his administration’s support for Israel was unparalleled. 'No one fought for Israel like I did,' Trump stated, citing his relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and the Abraham Accords, which realigned the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. His frustration with the current administration’s lackluster Middle East policy was palpable. For Rosenberg’s predominantly pro-Israel and conservative listeners, Trump’s words were a powerful call for renewed U.S. leadership in the region. Netanyahu’s Stark Warning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu didn’t mince words about the existential threats facing Israel. 'The situation is far worse than we expected,' Rosenberg reflected after his interview. With Hamas attacking from the south and Hezbollah amassing in the north, Israel is surrounded by enemies committed to its destruction. Netanyahu emphasized that while Israel is more than capable of defending itself, it cannot do so alone. Strong ties with the U.S. are not just an option—they are a necessity for Israel’s survival. Sderot: A Glimpse of Life Under Fire The geopolitical discussions with Trump and Netanyahu were critical, but what hit closest to home for Rosenberg was the experience of being in Sderot, a town constantly under threat from Hamas rockets. Just moments before going on air, explosions rocked the area, followed by sirens. Rosenberg was rushed to a bomb shelter by a young woman named Gitit, who broke down in tears as she recounted the horrors of October 7. 'These people go through this every day,' Rosenberg later reflected. Gitit’s story of survival, of barely escaping terrorists who attempted to storm her home, was a chilling reminder of the daily terror Israelis face. The Fight Against Global Antisemitism: A Personal Struggle But Rosenberg’s trip wasn’t just about Israel’s external threats. His phone call with his daughter Ava, who is facing rampant antisemitism while studying at Cardiff University in the UK, underscored the broader, global fight against Jew-hatred. Doxxing, harassment, and threats have become the norm for Jewish students like Ava, simply because of their identity. 'Ava, it’s all connected,' Rosenberg told her. The rise in antisemitism globally is a dangerous echo of the hatred Israel faces, and it is a fight that must be fought on all fronts. A Personal Connection with Israel’s Leaders Rosenberg’s trip wasn’t just about the big headlines; it was filled with personal moments, too. On Thursday night, Rosenberg joined the Falic family for prayers at the Western Wall, alongside Sara Netanyahu. It was a spiritual experience that brought Rosenberg closer to the heart of Israeli society, as tens of thousands gathered in prayer. Later, Rosenberg spent time with Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Though they disagree politically, both share an unwavering love for Israel. Herzog, in his own words, described Rosenberg as 'a cool guy' during their Yom Kippur meeting—an acknowledgment of Rosenberg’s unique role in bringing the stories of Israel’s fight to a global audience. A New Year, a Renewed Purpose On Yom Kippur, Rosenberg attended services in Efrat led by the dynamic Rabbi Shlomo Katz, where prayers were not solemn and silent, but full of joy, song, and dancing. It was a striking contrast to the typical Yom Kippur experience in America—here, Rosenberg witnessed a community that revels in its Jewish identity, full of energy and love for their faith. As the fast ended, Rosenberg gathered with Bibi and Sara Netanyahu for a celebratory meal. It was a casual, yet profound moment. Bibi took a personal interest in Rosenberg’s work, commending him for his worldwide reach and calling him 'a Champion for our People.' As Rosenberg reflected on the evening, he was filled with awe for the resilience of Israel’s leaders and the strength of its people. A Call to Action: The Fight for Israel is the Fight for Freedom The trip ended with a powerful realization: Israel’s fight is not just for its own survival—it’s a fight for the values we hold dear. Freedom, democracy, and the rule of law are all at stake. As Rosenberg concluded, 'We’re going to win, because we have to win.' This is a battle that demands the attention of every American who values liberty. With leaders like Trump and Netanyahu standing strong, the path forward is clear, but it will require steadfast commitment—from Israel and from its allies. November 5th will be a pivotal moment not only for America but for Israel and the world. Sid Rosenberg’s message is clear: Israel’s future hangs in the balance, and we must stand with our greatest ally now, more than ever.

Netanyahu, limited Iran attack failed the Israeli people – Journa...	Addressing Netanyahu, Riklin wrote that 'in the face of the war against Iran, you have not answered the call of the hour.' By World Israel News Staff A right-wing commentator and journalist, who is usually a staunch supporter of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, slammed the premier over what he said was a failure to deter Iran with Saturday's airstrikes. Shimon Riklin, a Channel 14 presenter who hosts The Patriots, one of the highest-rated news programs on Israeli television, wrote on social media platform X that the retaliatory attack on Iran represented a surrender to American pressure on Netanyahu's end. 'When the war began [on October 7th], Israel rose to the occasion. Civilian, soldiers, and police officers went to battle. Thousands were killed and wounded. Tens of thousands more lost their places of employment, studies, and plans' for the future,' Riklin wrote. Addressing Netanyahu, Riklin wrote that 'in the face of the war against Iran, you have not answered the call of the hour.' By not striking Israel's nuclear development sites, Netanyahu 'squandered a historic opportunity, the importance of which you have [previously] stressed to the public.' 'A great leader is not judged by his length of time in office, but the critical decisions he makes,' Riklin continued. The journalist said he believed that Netanyahu had folded under pressure from the Biden administration to avoid striking Iran's nuclear and oil sites. 'At the moment when the people of Israel needed you to rise to the occasion, we heard you obeying - in English - a president who's almost out of office,' he wrote. 'You now owe the people of Israel an explanation. Why did you hesitate and miss the opportunity?' Riklin also referred to the October 1 Iranian attack, which saw Tehran shoot nearly 200 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State. He also mentioned the drone attack on Netanyahu's Ceasarea residence, which was likely ordered by Iran but carried out by Hezbollah. 'How many more times should Iran shoot at us and you personally?'

Poll: Inflation trumps Middle East crisis for American voters	Inflation dominates voter concerns at 39%, with immigration (35%) and the economy (29%) rounding out the top three priorities. By Jewish Breaking News A comprehensive new Harvard University and Harris Poll survey reveals that while American support for Israel remains strong, voters are overwhelmingly focused on domestic concerns ahead of the upcoming election. The poll, which surveyed 3,145 registered voters including nearly 900 in battleground states, shows inflation dominating voter concerns at 39%, with immigration (35%) and the economy (29%) rounding out the top three priorities. Strikingly, the Israel-Hamas conflict ranks a distant 15th at just 6%, while concerns about antisemitism barely register at 2%. Despite the war’s low ranking in voter priorities, support for Israel remains strong at 81%. However, President Joe Biden’s handling of the situation garners only 35% approval, which could prove troubling for his reelection chances in November. In a head-to-head comparison on managing the conflict, former President Donald Trump edges out President Biden 47% to 37%, with 16% undecided. Political analysts note that with 62% of Americans following the conflict closely, and 73% viewing Iran as a regional sponsor of terror, while the Israel-Hamas war may not be driving voting decisions, it remains a significant factor in shaping American views of the Middle East. The survey also reveals interesting insights into Americans’ institutional trust. In a ranking of 19 countries, institutions, activist groups, and media companies, Israel placed fifth with 48% favorability. This puts it ahead of major media outlets like Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC, as well as political movements including Black Lives Matter and MAGA Republicans. Traditional institutions like the military, police, and the FBI ranked higher than Israel, while campus protesters, China, and the Palestinian Authority ranked lower.

‘Grave mistake’ or ‘good beginning’? Israeli politicians on scope...	Yair Lapid, leader of the opposition, wrote on Saturday on his X account that Iran should have 'paid a much heavier price.' By Anna Epshtein, TPS The Israeli attack in Iran has drawn both criticism and applause at home from across the political spectrum. Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir, who criticized Israel’s restrained response to the Iranian attack in April, wrote a more positive post on his X account this time, saying that the strike 'was a good beginning in order to target Iran’s strategic assets, which needs to be the next phase.' He added, 'We have a historic duty to remove the Iranian threat.' The attack was also praised by opposition leader Yair Golan, head of the Israeli Labor Party, for 'harming Iran’s defensive and offensive capabilities without dragging us into a war of attrition.' However, the strike was criticized for not inflicting serious damage to either Iranian economics by striking oil reserves or to Iran’s nuclear program. Yair Lapid, leader of the opposition, wrote on Saturday on his X account that Iran should have 'paid a much heavier price' and that 'the decision not to attack strategic and economic targets in Iran was wrong.' Tally Gotliv, a member of the Knesset from Netanyahu’s governing Likud party, used even stronger words, saying that 'Not striking Iran’s nuclear facilities will be a cause for regret for generations. Not striking Iran’s oil reserves is a grave mistake.' She added, 'Unfortunately, this is submission to the Biden administration which doesn’t think for a moment about Israel’s interests.' On Saturday, Israel struck a number of military targets in Iran in response to the Iranian attack on October 1. The Israeli attack in the early hours of Saturday morning was carried out by air force, striking, among other targets, missile manufacturing facilities. The Prime Minister’s office issued a denial of Hebrew media report arguing that Israel initially planned to strike Iran’s oil and natural gas facilities, but changed its plan after persistent US pressure. 'Israel chose the targets ahead of time, based on its national interests,' said the PMO, 'and not based on American directives.' 'Israel did not notify Iran before the attack — not about the timing, not about the targets, and not about the scale of the attack,' said another statement from the Prime Minister’s office.

Analysts said Russia’s involvement in the attacks is further indication of its efforts to stoke instability in the Middle East and divert Western attention from the conflict in Ukraine. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Russia provided satellite targeting data to the Houthis in Yemen, aiding the Iran-backed terrorist group’s missile and drone attacks on Western ships in the Red Sea this year, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The Houthis used the targeting data, which was funneled through members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps stationed in Yemen, to coordinate and expand strikes on ships along the vital global trade route, according to an individual familiar with the matter and two European defense officials. The Houthis began targeting Western ships in the Red Sea late last year in retaliation for Israel’s war against Hamas. Since then, the terrorists have attacked over 100 vessels, sinking two and hijacking another, the Journal reported. Analysts said Russia’s involvement in the attacks is further indication of its efforts to stoke instability in the Middle East and divert Western attention from the conflict in Ukraine. 'For Russia, any flare up anywhere is good news, because it takes the world’s attention further away from Ukraine and the U.S. needs to commit resources—Patriot systems or artillery shells—and with the Middle East in play, it’s clear where the U.S. will choose,' said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Berlin-based Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. The Houthi attacks have severely disrupted global trade, forcing many ships to instead go around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. Tanker traffic through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, which links the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, dropped by 77 percent in August compared to last October, according to maritime-intelligence company Windward. In December, the United States spearheaded a naval coalition to escort ships in the region, spending around $1 billion by April on ammunition to counter Houthi drones and missiles. Houthi terrorists also purchased weapons from Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was released by the Biden-Harris administration in exchange for U.S. basketball player Brittney Griner, the Journal reported this month.

Senate Republicans threaten UN funding if global body sidelines I...	The United States is the largest contributor to the world body, giving it and its agencies $18 billion in 2022—about one-third of the total U.N. budget. By Andrew Bernard, JNS Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and 27 other Republican senators introduced legislation on Tuesday that would cut off U.S. funding to the United Nations and its subsidiary agencies if they downgrade Israel’s status. 'Reports indicate that the Palestinian Authority will attempt to downgrade Israel’s status at the United Nations' following a U.N. General Assembly vote in May, the 28 senators wrote. That vote saw Palestinians gain new rights within their existing non-member 'permanent observer' status, which is short of full U.N. membership. 'Any attempt to alter Israel’s status at the United Nations is clearly antisemitic,' Risch stated. 'That said, if the U.N. member states allow the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization to downgrade Israel’s status at the U.N., the U.S. must stop supporting the U.N. system, as it would clearly be beyond repair.' Risch added that he is 'disgusted that this outrageous idea has even been discussed and will do all we can to ensure any changes to Israel’s status will come with consequences.' Titled the 'Stand with Israel Act,' the bill would forbid the federal government from disbursing funds to 'the United Nations or any of its funds, programs, specialized agencies or other related entities' if the global body 'expels, downgrades or suspends membership, or otherwise restricts the participation of Israel.' The United States is the largest contributor to the world body, giving it and its agencies $18 billion in 2022—about one-third of the total U.N. budget. Those contributions are mandatory for members of the U.N. General Assembly under the global body’s 'assessed contributions' system. Countries that fall into arrears on paying their contributions are stripped of their vote in the General Assembly. Objections are longstanding in Washington to paying for the budget in Turtle Bay. In 1982, then-Secretary of State George Schultz threatened U.S. withdrawal from any U.N. body that did not seat Israel. The United States nearly lost its General Assembly vote in a budget dispute in 1999. Former president Donald Trump cut off funding to the U.N. Palestinian aid agency, UNRWA, in 2018 and negotiated a lower overall U.N. budget in 2017. U.S. President Joe Biden restored funding to UNRWA before suspending it again in March after Israel accused employees of participating directly in the Hamas terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Several of the senators co-sponsoring the Stand with Israel Act said Jew-hatred at the United Nations undermines the agency’s effectiveness. 'A move to downgrade Israel’s status at the United Nations would be a new low, even for an organization that is as rife with antisemites as the United Nations,' stated Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). 'Unfortunately, antisemitism has pervaded the United Nations for decades and discredits the U.N. mission,' stated Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska). 'It must end.' Under existing U.S. law, Washington must cut off funding to the United Nations or any of its subsidiaries if the Palestinians are granted full membership outside of a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Reps. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) and Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) introduced companion legislation to the Senate act in the House in August with bipartisan support.

Biden-Harris admin sued for stonewalling investigation into Iran-...	In its lawsuit, the watchdog group accused the Defense Department of intentionally slow-rolling its request for internal documents and communications. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon A government watchdog group is suing the Biden-Harris administration for obstructing a yearlong investigation into senior Pentagon employee Ariane Tabatabai, the outed member of a secretive pro-Iran influence group operated by the hardline regime’s government. America First Legal, a nonprofit oversight group run by former Trump administration officials, filed its lawsuit against the Pentagon on Tuesday, accusing the agency of stonewalling its probe into Tabatabai and other senior U.S. officials for the past year, according to a copy of the filing obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The organization originally requested a trove of internal documents from the Pentagon and State Department as part of an investigation into Tabatabai’s relations with a host of pro-Tehran advocates, including one of her close associates, former Iran envoy Robert Malley, who is under investigation for mishandling classified information. The probe was launched amid mounting concerns that Tabatabai, Malley, and other senior Biden-Harris officials were conducting back-channel diplomacy with Iran, hoping to strengthen relations with the hardline regime. The Biden-Harris administration appears to be unbothered by those concerns. Tabatabai was recently promoted to deputy assistant secretary of defense within Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's office, where she leads its force education and training division. She was offered the position last month, shortly before the explosive leak of classified U.S. intelligence on Israel’s preparations for an upcoming strike on Iran. In addition to the lawsuit, America First Legal provided the Free Beacon with a cache of newly filed Freedom of Information Act Requests seeking details about who may have leaked that intelligence. The leak, which included top-secret documents from the U.S. intelligence community, is believed to have been motivated by a desire to handicap the Jewish state ahead of November’s election. Together, the joint lawsuit and FOIA campaign could help unearth previously unknown details about the Biden-Harris administration’s private discussions on Iran and Israel, the ongoing Middle East conflict, and behind-the-scenes efforts to restart diplomacy with Tehran during the Democratic administration’s four years in office. 'The Biden-Harris administration has appointed pro-Iranian apologists and influence agents to sensitive positions in the departments of defense and state,' said Reed Rubinstein, America First Legal’s senior vice president. 'Our lawsuit and most recent round of investigative demands should shine useful light on the role that these individuals may have played in leaking or sharing U.S. intelligence with the mullahs.' In its lawsuit, the watchdog group accused the Defense Department of intentionally slow-rolling its request for internal documents and communications, including encrypted text messages, sent between Malley, Tabatabai, and any individual inside the Iranian government. The initial request for this information was sent in October 2023, just after it was revealed that Malley had been suspended from his post amid a probe into his handling of classified information. It also followed reports that Tabatabai, a former State Department employee who now works on classified matters at the Pentagon, served as a member of the Iran Experts Initiative, a vast influence network created by Iran’s government and alleged to include two other Malley associates. The watchdog group’s search parameters included the keywords 'Robert Malley,' 'IEI,' 'Hamas,' 'Hezbollah,' 'Iran,' 'Zionist,' 'clearance,' and 'TS/SCI,' referring to information marked classified. The Pentagon was legally mandated to respond within 20 days to the organization’s FOIA request but blew past this deadline, claiming that a 'complex processing queue' and 'unusual circumstances' prevented it from producing the relevant documents, according to emails exchanged between the Defense Department and American First Legal in 2023. In its latest batch of FOIA requests, meanwhile, American First Legal petitioned the Pentagon, Office of Director of National Intelligence, State Department, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to hand over documents detailing all internal communications officials have engaged in since the classified intelligence pertaining to Israel became public. The top-secret intelligence originally appeared on a pro-Iran Telegram channel before spreading online, reportedly forcing Israel to delay its attack on Iran to stop it from making defensive preparations. While the identity of the leaker or leakers is unknown, outside groups like America First Legal suspect that any number of Biden-Harris administration figures could have released the information to thwart Israel’s counterstrike, payback for Tehran’s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack on the country. The Pentagon denied this week that Tabatabai was involved in the leak or is a person of interest in the investigation. America First Legal is asking that each agency release all records related to 'Iran,' 'Israel,' 'leak,' 'investigation,' and 'Telegram'—a broad request that could shine light on the administration’s private reaction to the dissemination of highly classified documents.

Israel strikes inside Iran, destroys ‘vital components’ of ballis...	The targets included missile and drone manufacturing facilities and launch sites, as well as air-defense batteries. By Jewish News Syndicate Israeli Air Force fighter jets conducted precision strikes on military targets in Iran overnight Friday, nearly one month after Tehran launched a massive ballistic-missile attack on the Jewish state. According to the Israel Defense Forces, dozens of aircraft, including refuelers and spy planes, conducted 'waves' of attacks over the course of a few hours across several regions of Iran, located some 1,600 kilometers from Israel. The targets included missile and drone manufacturing facilities and launch sites, as well as air-defense batteries. The facilities destroyed were vital components of Iran's ballistic missile program, Walla cited three anonymous Israeli sources as saying. The state-run SANA news outlet reported simultaneous Israeli strikes against military targets across central and southern Syria, amid Tehran’s decades-long effort to entrench itself in that country. The IDF named the operation 'Days of Repentance.' 'I can now confirm that we have concluded the Israeli response to Iran’s attacks against Israel. We conducted targeted and precise strikes on military targets in Iran—thwarting immediate threats to the State of Israel,' said IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. 'The Israel Defense Forces has fulfilled its mission. If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond. Our message is clear: All those who threaten the State of Israel and seek to drag the region into wider escalation will pay a heavy price,' Hagari continued. 'We demonstrated today that we have both the capability and the resolve to act decisively, and we are prepared—on offense and defense—to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel,' he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the overnight attack from the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, where he was later joined by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Mossad head David Barnea and Israel Security Agency leader Ronen Bar. 'The regime in Iran and its regional proxies have been relentlessly attacking Israel since [Hamas’s] Oct. 7th [massacre of 1,200 people]—on seven fronts—including direct attacks from Iranian soil,' the IDF said. 'Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and duty to respond.' The military was conducting an ongoing situation assessment, and there were no immediate changes to Home Front Command directives for civilians. Iran claimed to have successfully repelled the Israeli offensive, while ceding that 'limited damage' was caused to various sites. The Iranian military said that Israel had struck in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam. The Islamic Republic was prepared to retaliate to the 'aggression,' according to the country’s semi-official Tasnim news agency. 'There is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes,' the outlet quoted sources as saying. The Biden administration was informed of the strikes in advance, but the United States did not directly participate in the action. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett described the development as 'an exercise of self-defense and in response to Iran’s ballistic-missile attack against Israel on Oct. 1.' A senior administration official subsequently said that the attack 'should be the end of the direct military exchange between Israel and Iran. 'Should Iran choose to respond, we’re fully prepared to defend Israel and support Israel, and there will be consequences,' added the official. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin overnight Friday held a call with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, although no readout was provided. U.S. President Joe Biden previously urged Jerusalem to forgo attacking Iranian nuclear sites and oil fields, instead pressing for a small-scale operation. 'No administration has helped Israel more than I have—none, none, none. I think Bibi should remember that,' said the president, using Netanyahu’s nickname. By contrast, former president Donald Trump suggested that Iran’s nuclear infrastructure was fair game. 'I think he’s got that one wrong,' the Republican presidential candidate said of Biden. 'Isn’t that what you’re supposed to hit? I mean, it’s the biggest risk we have, nuclear weapons. … The answer should have been: Hit the nuclear first, and worry about the rest later.' Last week, Netanyahu emphasized that the Iranian targets chosen would be 'based on Israel’s national security needs.' Reports later suggested he had softened his stance in favor of a more limited strike due to Washington’s decision to deploy to Israel a THAAD advanced aerial defense system, and to avoid the perception of political interference in the upcoming U.S election. On Oct. 1, Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, forcing the entire civilian population of the Jewish state into bomb shelters. The targets of the Iranian attack were believed to be three Israeli Air Force bases, as well as an IDF military intelligence headquarters just north of Tel Aviv. In April, Iran conducted its first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory, launching some 300 missiles and drones, the vast majority of which were shot down in a multinational effort. The direct military confrontations come on the backdrop of Israel’s ongoing wars against Iranian terror proxies Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas's top negotiator, chided Israel for continuing to misread the group and said the conflict could continue for months, if not years. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas has rejected a deal put forward by Mossad chief David Barnea that would allow immunity and safe passage for Hamas terrorists in exchange for the hostages in Gaza, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. David Barnea met with Egyptian officials earlier this week, but Hamas rejected the proposal. Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas's top negotiator, chided Israel for continuing to misread the group and said the conflict could continue for months, if not years. According to the Qatari news organization, the Hamas official called for an end to what he termed the 'genocide' in northern Gaza before any agreement could be reached to release hostages. Despite Hamas's rejection of the proposal, Barnea is expected to meet with CIA Director William Burns for the first time in two months on Sunday in Doha, Qatar. A source told the Jerusalem Post that Barnea has 'been working under the radar' on a new deal 'with the Qataris, the Americans, and the Egyptians.' The renewed push for a hostage deal comes after a week of meetings between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Israeli and Arab officials. Blinken flew to the Middle East following the news of Israel's killing of Hamas leader and October 7th mastermind Yahya Sinwar. A version of the 'safe passage' in exchange for hostages proposal was offered in September, before Sinwar's death. In an interview with Bloomberg, Hirsch said, 'I'm ready to provide safe passage to Sinwar, his family, whoever wants to join him. We want the hostages back. We want demilitarization, de-radicalization of course — a new system that will manage Gaza,' he stated. 'In parallel, I must work on plans B, C, and D because I must bring the hostages back home. The clock is ticking; the hostages do not have time,' Hirsch added.

Israel gave Iran advance warning before attack – report	Israel reportedly informed Iran which targets would be hit and urging Tehran not to respond. By Jewish Breaking News Israel warned Iran through multiple diplomatic channels before launching its retaliatory strikes early Saturday, making clear which targets would be hit and urging Tehran not to respond, sources familiar with the communications tell Axios. Delivered through several intermediaries including Dutch Foreign Minister Casper Veldhoven, the message came with a stark warning: any Iranian retaliation, especially if resulting in Israeli civilian casualties, would trigger an even more severe response from the IDF. Iran’s Foreign Ministry responded to the strikes by invoking its right to self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, condemning what it called 'a clear violation of international law.' The ministry vowed to 'employ all physical and spiritual capabilities' to protect Iranian interests and security, while calling for international intervention against Israel’s 'genocide' in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel’s operation reportedly unfolded in three precise waves. Initial strikes disabled Iranian air defense systems, followed by attacks on missile and drone bases across Tehran, Karaj, Isfahan, and Shiraz regions. The mission, involving dozens of Israeli aircraft and reaching targets 1,600 kilometers away, marked the first time Israel immediately acknowledged such a deep-strike operation into Iranian territory. While Iran claimed successful interceptions, Israeli officials dismissed these assertions, declaring all mission objectives achieved by 6 a.m. US officials say they expect Iran to respond to the Israeli attack in the coming days but keep its response measured to avoid further escalation. 'It is our aim to accelerate diplomacy and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region. We urge Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation,' said National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett.

IDF discovers Hezbollah tunnel and plans to launch an Oct 7th-sty...	At the beginning of Israel's ground operation in Lebanon, the IDF discovered a detailed Hezbollah plan for an October 7th style invasion of Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a private residence close to the Israeli border, IDF soldiers in Lebanon discovered a shaft leading to a 1.5-kilometer tunnel that was designed to launch an October 7th-style invasion into Israel. The tunnel, with the capacity to hold hundreds of terrorists, was uncovered last week by the IDF’s Yahalom Unit along with plans to carry out an invasion. Before blowing up the tunnel, Brig.-Gen. Guy Levy, who heads the IDF’s 98th Division, led journalists into the belly of the extensive tunnel. 'We are at a central intersection of this tunnel,' which is also a 'very significant underground combat compound,' Levy said as he stood at the shaft. 'The enemy built this over many years to prepare to attack Israel,' he said. 'It can hold hundreds of terrorists for an extended stay of weeks' and extends 'hundreds of meters.' On October 1st, when the IDF began its operation in southern Lebanon, it declassified a document it discovered in enemy territory describing a Hezbollah operation to attack Israel called 'Conquer the Galilee.' The IDF has invited journalists into the tunnel to document and publicize information about a long-planned attack that the military operation in Lebanon was designed to prevent. The IDF fought a 48-hour battle to capture the village with the home that housed the shaft of the large tunnel. Inside the tunnel was a storage room with rifles, RPK machine guns, Kornet anti-tank missiles, and boxes of ammunition, and many of the items were supplied by Iran. In addition, there was food, medical supplies, bathrooms, and cots for terrorists to stay and prepare for the invasion. 'I feel like I have entered the belly of the enemy, taken when they built over years,' said Lt.-Col. Yoni HaCohen.Finding this tunnel and destroying it, he said, 'is a great success.'

5 Things to know about Israel’s retaliatory attack on Iran	The Israeli military said its 'precise and targeted strikes' hit missile air defense systems and 'aerial capabilities' as well as missile manufacturing facilities. By Adam Schreck, The Associated Press Israel delivered its long-expected response to Iranian missile attacks early Saturday by carrying out a series of airstrikes against the Islamic Republic. Here’s what to know: Multiple targets were struck Under the cover of darkness early Saturday, Israel struck multiple sites in different parts of Iran. Explosions were heard in the capital, Tehran, which sits deep inside the country. The Israeli military said its 'precise and targeted strikes' hit missile air defense systems and 'aerial capabilities' as well as missile manufacturing facilities used to produce weapons that have been used against Israel. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage.' It was not immediately clear how hard of a blow Israel dealt, with neither country providing detailed assessments of the destruction. Iran said the strikes targeted military bases in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran. Israel appeared confident in its battering of Iran’s air defenses, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying that 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' What wasn’t hit also matters The strikes did not appear to target facilities that would all but ensure a harsh Iranian response. Those most notably include Iran’s oil infrastructure, the backbone of the OPEC member’s economy, and its nuclear facilities. President Biden earlier this month said he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. officials felt they had secured agreement from Israel not to hit nuclear or oil sites after dispatching another air-defense missile battery and associated troops, though those assurances were not set in stone. This attack has finished Israel signaled that the pre-dawn bombardment was the end of this attack. 'The retaliatory strike has been completed, and its objectives have been achieved,' Hagari said early Saturday, still the Sabbath in Israel. Not long after, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization said commercial flights would resume after being halted because of the airstrikes. Tehran’s shops were open and streets were calm, though lines grew at gas stations as residents stocked up on fuel. The Israeli attacks aimed to deter future aggression and 'show we won’t be silent,' but to do so in a way that would minimize the embarrassment for Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. Outrage and calls for restraint The White House indicated that it wants the strikes to end the direct exchanges of fire between Israel and Iran, and warned Iran against responding. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there was a 'need to avoid further regional escalation' and called on all sides to show restraint. Reactions in the region were tougher. Saudi Arabia, Iran’s main Arab rival, condemned the strike, calling it a threat to regional security and 'a violation of international laws and norms.' Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' and said 'putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty.' Syria and Iraq were among other countries in the region condemning the strikes. So did Hamas, which along with other militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 hostages into Gaza. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up for more than half the deaths. Iran’s response will be key The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would respond to the airstrikes, calling them a clear violation of international law as it asserted Tehran’s right to self-defense. Israel characterized Saturday’s attack as a response to previous aerial assaults by Iran using missiles and exploding drones in April and another missile attack this month. Many of those projectiles were shot down before reaching their targets. Iran could attempt another direct bombardment, though doing so risks provoking yet another direct Israeli attack on its territory at a moment when its defenses are weakened. It could also encourage allied militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon to intensify their attacks, though both have suffered serious blows in their ongoing wars with Israel. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are in fact quite serious,' predicted Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in by their own military limitations, economic constraints from sanctions and by the U.S. election outcome,' which could affect the course of further escalation or diplomatic outreach.

Israel strikes military targets inside Iran	The targets included missile and drone manufacturing facilities and launch sites, as well as air-defense batteries. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Air Force fighter jets conducted precision strikes on military targets in Iran overnight Friday, nearly one month after Tehran launched a massive ballistic-missile attack on the Jewish state. According to the Israel Defense Forces, dozens of aircraft, including refuelers and spy planes, conducted 'waves' of attacks over the course of a few hours across several regions of Iran, located some 1,600 kilometers from Israel. The targets included missile and drone manufacturing facilities and launch sites, as well as air-defense batteries. The state-run SANA news outlet reported simultaneous Israeli strikes against military targets across central and southern Syria, amid Tehran’s decades-long effort to entrench itself in that country. The IDF named the operation 'Days of Repentance.' 'I can now confirm that we have concluded the Israeli response to Iran’s attacks against Israel. We conducted targeted and precise strikes on military targets in Iran—thwarting immediate threats to the State of Israel,' said IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. 'The Israel Defense Forces has fulfilled its mission. If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond. Our message is clear: All those who threaten the State of Israel and seek to drag the region into wider escalation will pay a heavy price,' Hagari continued. 'We demonstrated today that we have both the capability and the resolve to act decisively, and we are prepared—on offense and defense—to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel,' he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the overnight attack from the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, where he was later joined by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Mossad head David Barnea and Israel Security Agency leader Ronen Bar. 'The regime in Iran and its regional proxies have been relentlessly attacking Israel since [Hamas’s] Oct. 7th [massacre of 1,200 people]—on seven fronts—including direct attacks from Iranian soil,' the IDF said. 'Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and duty to respond.' The military was conducting an ongoing situation assessment, and there were no immediate changes to Home Front Command directives for civilians. Iran claimed to have successfully repelled the Israeli offensive, while ceding that 'limited damage' was caused to various sites. The Iranian military said that Israel had struck in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam. The Islamic Republic was prepared to retaliate to the 'aggression,' according to the country’s semi-official Tasnim news agency. 'There is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes,' the outlet quoted sources as saying. The Biden administration was informed of the strikes in advance, but the United States did not directly participate in the action. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett described the development as 'an exercise of self-defense and in response to Iran’s ballistic-missile attack against Israel on Oct. 1.' A senior administration official subsequently said that the attack 'should be the end of the direct military exchange between Israel and Iran. 'Should Iran choose to respond, we’re fully prepared to defend Israel and support Israel, and there will be consequences,' added the official. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin overnight Friday held a call with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, although no readout was provided. U.S. President Joe Biden previously urged Jerusalem to forgo attacking Iranian nuclear sites and oil fields, instead pressing for a small-scale operation. 'No administration has helped Israel more than I have—none, none, none. I think Bibi should remember that,' said the president, using Netanyahu’s nickname. By contrast, former president Donald Trump suggested that Iran’s nuclear infrastructure was fair game. 'I think he’s got that one wrong,' the Republican presidential candidate said of Biden. 'Isn’t that what you’re supposed to hit? I mean, it’s the biggest risk we have, nuclear weapons. … The answer should have been: Hit the nuclear first, and worry about the rest later.' Last week, Netanyahu emphasized that the Iranian targets chosen would be 'based on Israel’s national security needs.' Reports later suggested he had softened his stance in favor of a more limited strike due to Washington’s decision to deploy to Israel a THAAD advanced aerial defense system, and to avoid the perception of political interference in the upcoming U.S election. On Oct. 1, Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, forcing the entire civilian population of the Jewish state into bomb shelters. The targets of the Iranian attack were believed to be three Israeli Air Force bases, as well as an IDF military intelligence headquarters just north of Tel Aviv. In April, Iran conducted its first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory, launching some 300 missiles and drones, the vast majority of which were shot down in a multinational effort. The direct military confrontations come on the backdrop of Israel’s ongoing wars against Iranian terror proxies Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Construction begins in Saudi Arabia on Mukaab, expected to be the...	Mukaab will be 1,300 feet high and 1,200 feet wide, and it will be extensive enough to contain 20 Empire State buildings. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In Saudi Arabia, construction has begun on the $50 billion Mukaab project, which, upon its completion, is expected to be the world's largest building. It will also use artificial intelligence and green technology in its design. Located in Riyadh, Mukaab will be 1,300 feet high and 1,200 feet wide, and it will be extensive enough to contain 20 Empire State buildings. With 2 million square feet of floor space, the structure is expected to be a 'downtown in a box' and will house office space, apartments, hotels, restaurants, and retail space. The massive, high-tech cube will also contain 104,000 residential units and 9,000 hotel rooms. Mukaab will use artificial intelligence to create immersive experiences for guests and residents and will use ecology and traditional architecture to enhance the aesthetics. The building will recreate the experience of walking through wadis or riverbed formations, giving visitors the feeling that they are roaming past desert streams cascading off craggy rocks. The square design is a tribute to the Najdi architecture style, characterized by mudbrick buildings, triangular or rectangular windows and door openings, and centralized outdoor courtyards. Mukaab is estimated to add $51 billion to non-oil-related GDP and will generate over 330,000 jobs. The project will employ 900 workers and is expected to be completed by 2030 as part of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's Saudi Vision 2030, a project to reduce dependence on oil and expand the nation's economy, including the public service sector. Mohammad bin Salman has planned other projects as part of Saudi Vision 2030, including a floating port city called Oxagon, located on the Red Sea coast, a mountain tourist destination called Trojena, and a futuristic city called NEOM powered by renewable energy. In addition, plans are in place for 'The Line,' a 105-mile-long development that could house 9 million people while running entirely on renewable energy.

Progressives put pressure on Kamala Harris to change her message ...	Some liberals are frustrated by her approach, especially on her perceived support for Israel in the war against Hamas. By Steve Peoples, Associated Press Progressive Democrats warn Kamala Harris risks losing the support of a small but significant portion of her political base unless she changes her campaign’s closing message — and its messengers — immediately. Specifically, several progressive leaders believe that the Democratic nominee has been too focused on winning over moderate Republicans in recent days at the expense of her own party’s passionate liberals. And they say that Harris’ closing message, which is increasingly centered on Republican Donald Trump and the threat he poses to U.S. democracy, ignores the economic struggles of the nation’s working class. Some far-left leaders are also irked that Harris has shared the stage in recent days with former House Republican leader Liz Cheney and billionaire businessman Mark Cuban while progressive icons like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been relegated to low-profile roles. 'The truth of the matter is that there are a hell of a lot more working-class people who could vote for Kamala Harris than there are conservative Republicans,' Sanders told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday. Sanders noted that he’s been doing whatever he’s asked to help Harris win. He has participated in two dozen Harris campaign related-events this month alone, although they’re largely in rural areas. None have been with Harris. 'She has to start talking more to the needs of working-class people,' Sanders said. 'I wish this had taken place two months ago. It is what it is.' Less than two weeks before Election Day, Harris is trying to assemble a sprawling coalition featuring voting groups with conflicting priorities. She’s relying on the traditional Democratic base — African Americans, Latinos and young people who overwhelmingly lean left. Harris’ team is aware that some liberals are frustrated by her approach, especially on her support for Israel’s war against Hamas. But the campaign sees a major opportunity to expand her coalition by winning over disaffected Republicans, especially college-educated voters in the nation’s suburbs, who are uneasy about Trump. From the Harris campaign’s perspective, the focus on moderate Republicans at this moment is simply a matter of math. The Democrat’s campaign assesses that 10% of swing-state voters are still undecided or persuadable, according to an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Of that 10%, some 7% are considered 'Cheney Republicans' who are receptive to messages attacking Trump, the aide said. At the same time, the Harris campaign believes her chief political liability is the perception that she’s too far left. Trump’s allies are pounding the airwaves accusing the former California senator of being a 'radical-left liberal.' Therefore, she has been reluctant to appear with progressive icons like Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist. Harris instead made three swing-state appearances this week with Cheney, a stalwart conservative who was a Trump ally before turning sharply against him after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Harris is scheduled to deliver a major address next week, a formal closing argument of sorts, focused on the danger Trump poses to U.S. democracy. She will deliver the speech on Tuesday at the Ellipse in Washington, the same location where Trump hosted the rally that preceded the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Frustrated progressives do not discount the need to warn voters of Trump’s authoritarian leanings, but some wish her closing message was more focused on addressing voters’ overwhelming pessimism about the state of the economy and the direction of the country. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, praised Harris’ advertising team for 'smartly' investing hundreds of millions of dollars behind ads focusing on grocery prices, taxing billionaires and Social Security — 'things that both win swing voters and pump up the base.' But, Green said, 'there’s been an odd disconnect between the campaign’s economic populist ad strategy and the event strategy that focuses almost exclusively on Liz Cheney kumbaya optics that depress the base right as voting begins and don’t provably win more swing voters than bread-and-butter issues.' Other are frustrated that the Harris campaign hasn’t featured progressive leaders like Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez in higher-profile spots. Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of the progressive group Our Revolution, suggested that as many as 10% of progressives may not vote for Harris because of their frustrations. Some may not cast a ballot at all, he said, while some may even support Trump. The former president has called Cheney, a backer of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, a 'stupid war hawk' as he tries to win over Arab Americans in Michigan angry about the more than 42,000 Palestinians killed in Israel’s Gaza offensive. 'We just want to raise a red flag. Don’t take the progressive movement for granted,' Geevarghese said. 'There’s got to be an economic argument at the end of the day. That’s the No. 1 thing that matters to voters.' Indeed, about 4 in 10 likely voters in a recent CNN poll said the economy was their most important issue when deciding how to vote, and about 2 in 10 said protecting democracy was. About 1 in 10 named either immigration or abortion and reproductive rights. To be sure, Harris is not ignoring the economy or other progressive priorities. She has outlined plans to crack down on price gouging by corporations to help reduce the cost of groceries in addition to reducing the cost of prescription drugs, cutting taxes on the middle class while raising taxes on billionaires, offering a $25,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers to help lower housing costs, and expanding Medicare to cover vision and hearing coverage, among other things. Ocasio-Cortez made three stops in swing-state Pennsylvania last week on Harris’ behalf. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, a key Harris ally, has also been a steady presence on the campaign trail. Former President Barack Obama, still beloved by many progressive voters, has been active in the campaign’s closing days. He headlined an event with Harris for the first time on Thursday night in Georgia. Meanwhile, Trump is continuing to lean in on the issues that his campaign sees as his strongest: the economy and inflation, immigration, crime and foreign policy. The Republican nominee is set to outline his formal closing message Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York City that’s expected to focus on average Americans’ displeasure with the direction of the country. He begins virtually every rally with a variation of: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? 'Kamala Harris broke the economy. She broke the border. President Trump very clearly is going to fix the economy and fix the border,' said Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller, who argued Harris, with her focus on Trump, wasn’t talking about how she will make life better for the vast majority of Americans. Harris acknowledged during a CNN town hall this week that some progressives may be unhappy with her leadership, particularly on Israel. 'But I also do know that for many people who care about this issue, they also care about bringing down the price of groceries,' she said. 'They also care about our democracy and not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.'

Israel demands ‘urgent investigation’ after Hamas commander found...	The IDF said it killed in an airstrike Mohammad Abu Itiwi, a senior commander from Hamas’s elite Nukhba unit, who was employed by UNWRA. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel demanded an 'urgent investigation' of UNRWA as the agency confirmed on Thursday that a Hamas commander who participated in the October 7 attacks was on its payroll. The Israel Defense Forces said it killed in an airstrike Mohammad Abu Itiwi, a senior commander from Hamas’s elite Nukhba unit, who was employed by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which supports Palestinian refugees. 'Following this, our representatives solicited clarifications from senior officials in the @UN and international community and requested an urgent investigation into the involvement of @UNRWA employees in the October 7th Massacre' tweeted the Defense Ministry’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories unit (COGAT) on Thursday night. UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma confirmed that Itiwi’s name was included in an Israeli letter in July which identified other Hamas figures on the agency staff. 'The UNRWA commissioner general responded to that letter immediately stating that any allegation is taken seriously. He urged [Israeli officials] to cooperate with the agency by providing more information so he could take action,' Touma said. UNRWA has been under fire for months, with Israeli officials demanding the agency be stripped of its authority in Gaza and defunded amid revelations that members of the agency’s staff participated in Hamas’s October 7 attacks. The Israeli government is bypassing UNRWA in distributing humanitarian aid and advancing legislation to label the agency as a terror organization and remove its diplomatic immunity, tax-exempt status and other legal benefits. Palestinian refugees are the only refugee population with its own dedicated. UN agency. The rest of the world’s refugees fall under the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Israeli officials have called for UNRWA to be closed and for Palestinian refugees to be brought under the responsibility of the UNHCR. In June, more than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA, accusing the agency of 'aiding and abetting' the terror group. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Nukhba terrorist who led Oct 7th Nova bomb shelter attack elimina...	Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was executed by his Hamas captors in September, lost an arm in the attack and was taken hostage along with Alon Ohel, Or Levy, and Eliya Cohen. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Thursday, in a joint effort by the IDF, Israel's security agency (Shin Bet), and the IAF, the commander in charge of the October 7 attack on the bomb shelter close to the Nova music festival was eliminated. The IDF reported that Mohammad Abu Itiwi was a Nukhba commander in the Al Bureij Battalion of Hamas's Central Camps Brigade. Itiwi led the attack on the bomb shelter on Route 232 in the area of Re'im in southern Israel. While Nova festival attendees were hiding on October 7, terrorists attacked the shelter with grenades, killing many of those inside and injuring others. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was executed by his Hamas captors in September, lost an arm in the attack and was taken hostage along with Alon Ohel, Or Levy, and Eliya Cohen. Itiwi led many other terror attacks against Israelis, and his name appears on a list of employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA). Throughout the war, it has come to light that UNRWA, an organization with the stated aim of providing aid to Palestinians, has been heavily embedded with terrorists. When Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed two weeks ago, one of his bodyguards, also eliminated in the attack, held a UNRWA membership card. Fateh Sherif, who commanded Hamas in Lebanon and was killed in an Israeli strike in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre last month, was also an employee of UNWRA. Sherif was the principal of UNRWA's Deir Yassin School in Tyre and headed the UNRWA teacher's union in Lebanon. The Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee unanimously approved two legislative proposals early in October aimed at curbing the activities of UNWRA within Israel. 'UNRWA is out!' Committee Chairman MK Yuli Edelstein declared after the vote. 'The problem of UNRWA did not begin on October 7; it has long been a concern that has surfaced in all its malignancy. For many years, lawmakers across the political spectrum have raised the issue and advanced legislative proposals.'

French president Macron accuses Israel of ‘sowing barbarism,’ com...	Macron said Israel 'knows from experience that its military successes do not necessarily represent victory in Lebanon.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News At an international conference on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron urged countries to give 'massive' aid to Lebanon and accused Israel of 'sowing barbarism' with its operations against Hezbollah. While pledging a $108 million (100 million euro) aid package, Macron declared, 'In the immediate term, massive aid is needed for the Lebanese population, both for the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the war and for the communities hosting them.' The United Nations has recommended $426 million in humanitarian aid for Lebanon. In addition to France's $106 million, Italy has pledged $10.8 million, and Germany has vowed to give $64.7 million. At the same time, Macron strongly criticized Israel for its military operations in South Lebanon, which has been blamed for the displacement of 800,000 people. Urging a ceasefire, Macron said, 'in the south, in Beirut, elsewhere, and that the number of civilian victims continues to rise.' Although he briefly criticized Hezbollah for its attacks against Israel, which began on October 8th, he focused his criticism on Israeli strikes against the terror group. He said Hezbollah should 'stop its provocations… and indiscriminate strikes' against Israel. However, he added that Israel 'knows from experience that its military successes do not necessarily represent victory in Lebanon.' 'I'm not sure you can defend a civilization by sowing barbarism yourself,' he added. In Lebanon, Hezbollah functions like a state within a state, and the country is controlled by dueling factions with no functioning president. Israel's Northern Command reports that Hezbollah only has 30% of its rockets and launchers remaining and has lost 2,000 of its terrorists since October 8th last year. The Northern Command added that just a few more weeks of operations in Lebanon are required to accomplish goals that will allow northern Israeli residents to return home in safety. According to IDF data, 2,000 Hezbollah terrorists have been eliminated since the war began, 1,200 of them since the initial ground operation in Lebanon. Of the terrorists the IDF eliminated, seven were Hezbollah brigade commanders, 21 were battalion commanders, and 24 were company commanders. The IDF attacked 3,200 Hezbollah targets, which include weapons depots, launchers, anti-tank positions, and command centers, 300 of them in the last 24 hours.

Biden-Harris admin promotes Pentagon employee tied to Iranian inf...	Ariane Tabatabai, outed as a member of the Iran Experts Initiative, will now lead DoD's 'force and education training' By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon The Biden-Harris administration has promoted the senior Pentagon employee who was outed as a member of an Iranian government-run influence operation, Politico reported. Ariane Tabatabai is now a deputy assistant secretary of defense within Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's office, where she will lead its force education and training division. Tabatabai, according to Politico, was offered the promotion last month. She previously served as chief of staff for the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict. Tabatabai became a public commodity after a 2023 Semafor report outed her as a member of an Iranian government propaganda group known as the Iran Experts Initiative. The affiliation saw Tabatabai report back to Iran’s foreign ministry and communicate with senior officials in the hardline regime. Tabatabai's promotion comes at a curious time for the Biden-Harris administration. Over the weekend, classified U.S. intelligence on Israel's military preparations for a strike on Iran leaked in a 'deadly serious breach,' which the administration is investigating. While the leaker has not been publicly identified, the situation has raised concerns about a host of Biden-Harris administration officials, including Tabatabai, who want to increase diplomacy with Iran at the cost of the historically close U.S. alliance with Israel. News of Tabatabai's affiliation with the Iran Experts Initiative sparked multiple congressional investigations, with Republicans raising concerns about Tabatabai’s ability to obtain a top-secret security clearance. The Pentagon and State Department, where Tabatabai formerly worked, have vocally defended her, saying there was nothing in her background that would have disqualified her from accessing classified information. 'Dr. Tabatabai was thoroughly and properly vetted as a condition of her employment with the Department of Defense,' a Pentagon spokesman told the Washington Free Beacon in September 2023, after lawmakers raised concerns about her connections to Iran. 'We are honored to have her serve.' One month later, the Pentagon confirmed to lawmakers that Tabatabai would keep her security clearance. Tabatabai and two others affiliated with the pro-Tehran group served as aides to former Biden-Harris administration Iran envoy Robert Malley, who was suspended from his post amid an ongoing FBI investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified information. An inspector general report released last month skewered the State Department for its handling of the suspension. The agency, according to the report, allowed Malley to continue accessing classified information and sensitive data after he was disciplined. 'The Department deviated from the way that suspensions are typically delivered by delaying notification to Mr. Malley until senior Department officials were apprised of his suspension,' the report stated. 'The delay allowed him the opportunity to participate in a classified conference call after the suspension was approved, but before he was notified.'

Ten IDF soldiers killed in south Lebanon in two days	Five Israeli soldiers killed in a Hezbollah rocket attack in southern Lebanon, a day after five others were killed in a pair of incidents. By World Israel News Staff Five IDF soldiers were killed during a Hezbollah rocket attack in southern Lebanon on Thursday, the IDF announced Friday, after the soldiers' identities were cleared for publication by the army censor. The soldiers, all reservists, were from the 89th Battalion of the IDF's 8th Armored Brigade. They included 43-year-old Major Dan Maori of Beit Yitzhak, the battalion's deputy commander, and 28-year-old Alon Safrai from Jerusalem, a tank officer. Chief Warrant Officer Omri Lotan, 47, of Bat Hefer, Chief Warrant Officer Guy Idan, 51, of Kibbutz Shomrat, and Staff-Sergeant-Major Tom Segal, 28, of Ein Habesor, were also killed in the attack. In addition to the 5 fatalities in the Hezbollah attack, 19 other IDF reservist soldiers were injured, including 5 who were seriously injured. According to a preliminary investigation by the Israeli military, a Hezbollah rocket struck a building in southern Lebanon where the 89th Battalion was receiving an incoming supply convoy. One of the fallen soldiers, Guy Idan, has been identified as the cousin of Tsahi Idan, a hostage taken captive by Hamas terrorists on October 7th after they invaded his home town of Kibbutz Nahal Oz. Five more soldiers were killed and seven wounded in a pair of incidents in southern Lebanon Wednesday night and Thursday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 10 from Wednesday night through Thursday. The soldiers include Warrant Officer (res.) Mordechai Haim Amoyal, Sgt. Maj. (res.) Shmuel Harari, Master Sgt. (res.) Shlomo Aviad Nayman, and Sgt. First Class (res.) Shuvael Ben-Natan and Sgt. First class Guy Ben-Harosh, 23. Four of the soldiers, including Amoyal, Harari, Nayman, and Ben-Natan, were killed when Hezbollah terrorists hidden underground ambushed the soldiers as they passed by, hurling grenades at them.

Israel has repeatedly pointed out that the deliveries of humanitarian aid are being looted by the armed jihadists of Hamas, who often attack Palestinian civilians for trying to access them. By i24 and Algemeiner Staff Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday announced another $135 million in aid to Gaza, saying it was critical that aid enter the war-ravaged enclave. Blinken spoke in Qatar on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the war in Gaza last year, sparked by the October 7 massacre. Washington has pressed Israel to allow more aid into the devastated Palestinian territory, while Israel has repeatedly pointed out that the deliveries are being looted by the armed jihadists of Hamas, who often attack Palestinian civilians for trying to access them. In Qatar, Blinken 'discussed renewed efforts to secure the release of the hostages and end the war in Gaza' with the Gulf state’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, the State Department said. Having wrapped up a two-day trip to Israel, Blinken now seeks to build momentum for a ceasefire after Israel’s killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar; he flew to Qatar to seek assessments of where Hamas stands on a truce.

Hamas chief ordered terrorists to keep Israeli hostages alive to ...	Newly-released handwritten documents penned by the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar include detailed documentation of the hostages taken captive on October 7th, along with instructions on how to guard them and keep them alive for a deal to release jailed terrorists. By World Israel News Staff The late Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar ordered terrorists guarding Israeli captives taken during the invasion of October 7th to ensure the hostages' survival, so that they could be used to secure the release of jailed Palestinian terrorists, according to documents written by Sinwar which were published by a Palestinian newspaper this week. The Arabic daily Al-Quds published scans of three pages which allegedly including Sinwar's instructions to underlings regarding the handling of Israeli hostages. The documents also include meticulous details regarding their distribution, demographic breakdown, occupations, and names, with some names matching those released during a prior deal in November. The first document contains directives on protecting the lives of hostages, emphasizing their strategic value for future prisoner exchanges with Israel. Sinwar cited verses from the Quran, underscoring the importance of using the hostages as leverage. 'They are an important card,' Sinwar wrote, according to the report. A second paper offers a statistical overview of the hostages, categorizing them by gender, age, and civilian or military status. The documents allegedly specify where Bedouin captives are held, although the specific geographic details were censored. This list reportedly tallied a total of 72 hostages at the time of recording, many of whom were subsequently released. In a third paper, 11 released hostages are listed with identifying information such as age and foreign citizenship status. The named hostages include Rimon Kirsht, Tami Metzger, and Nili Margalit, the latter noted as a nurse.

Iran planning unprecedented attack if Israel retaliates for balli...	Iran reportedly looking to avoid major reprisal from Israel over ballistic missile attacks - while at the same time preparing major attacks on Israel and international energy supplies, in the event of an Israeli attack. By World Israel News Staff The Iranian military is preparing for an unprecedented attack on both Israel and international trade and energy supplies, even as Tehran hopes to avoid a major escalation with the Jewish state, The New York Times reported on Thursday. Citing four Iranian officials - including two officers in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - who spoke with the paper by telephone earlier this week, the Times report claimed that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has instructed the Iranian military to draft plans for various possible attacks on not only Israeli targets, but also ships carrying goods - in particular, oil - through the Persian Gulf. Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on October 1st, prompting Israel to vow a major retaliation. While Tehran has reportedly signaled via interlocutors that it will not respond to a symbolic Israeli retaliation, according to the Times report, Iran is at the same time gearing up to strike should an Israeli attack cross one of Tehran's red lines. According to the report, Iran's leadership will order a major reprisal should Israel strike Iran's nuclear program, cause major damage to the country's oil or natural gas production, or assassinates senior Iranian leaders. Some of the possible Iranian reprisal attacks under consideration are an upscaled ballistic missile attack, dwarfing the April 13th and October 1st attacks, which including some 120 and 180 ballistic missile launches respectively. The Iranian officials cited said that Tehran could launch a barrage of up to 1,000 ballistic missiles in the next strike. In addition, proxy groups working on behalf of Iran, including Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and various militia groups operating out of Iraq and Syria, could also attack Israel. Furthermore, Iran is considering attacks on international trade, in particular oil tankers traveling through the Persian Gulf. 'In the event of an Israeli attack, the shape of our response will be proportionate and calculated,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, told Russian reporters on Wednesday.

Freed Israeli hostage tells UN of horrifying sexual assault durin...	Soussana told the UN, 'Fulfill your duty. Take immediate action to secure the release of those still held captive.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Wednesday, Amit Soussana, a lawyer who was kidnapped from Kfar Azza by Hamas on October 7th and released after 55 days, described her horrifying ordeal as a hostage in Gaza, which included sexual assault. 'I was held captive alone, chained by my ankle with a metal chain, unable to move, and had to ask for permission to use the bathroom,' she said. 'In that house, I was sexually assaulted by the Hamas terrorist who guarded me. He forced me to go to the shower and entered the room, pointing his gun at me. He was breathing heavily and had a monstrous, beast-like face,' Soussana continued. 'I knew exactly what he was planning to do, yet I couldn't do anything to prevent it. I was utterly helpless. When the assault was over, I wasn't even allowed to cry or to be sad. I had no one to comfort me and was forced to act nice to the person who had just sexually assaulted me in the most horrifying way,' she added. 'Not a day goes by that I don't think about what that terrible man did to me. We were held in such inhumane conditions. No person should ever be subjected to such ruthless treatment,' she said. Soussana appealed to the UN to take action to secure the release of the hostages. 'Fulfill your duty. Take immediate action to secure the release of those still held captive. Every day that passes steals another piece of their soul and endangers their life. Act now before it is too late…do not turn a blind eye to the atrocities being committed against innocent civilians.' Soussana attended a screening of a documentary produced by former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg called 'Screams Before Silence,' detailing the sexual crimes committed by Hamas on and after October 7th.

5 IDF soldiers killed in Southern Lebanon	Since the beginning of the ground war in Lebanon, 22 IDF soldiers have been killed in battle. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Four IDF soldiers were killed Wednesday night, and one fell on Thursday morning battling Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. The names of the fallen soldiers are as follows: Warrant Officer (res.) Mordechai Haim Amoyal, Sgt. Maj. (res.) Shmuel Harari, Master Sgt. (res.) Shlomo Aviad Nayman, and Sgt. First Class (res.) Shuvael Ben-Natan and Sgt. First class Guy Ben-Harosh (23). A total of 7 IDF soldiers were wounded in Lebanon between Wednesday and Thursday. Amoyal, Harari, Nayman, and Ben-Natan were preparing to battle Radwan force terrorists who had hidden in an area with dense forestation and tunnels where they could hide. Although airstrikes were intended to clear the area and make it safe for IDF troops, the terrorists managed to hide underground and throw grenades at the soldiers as they approached. After the terrorists attacked, IDF troops threw grenades and neutralized them. During this incident, in addition to the four soldiers who were killed, six were injured, three in serious condition. Major General Guy Ben-Harosh was killed in another area of southern Lebanon, and a reserve soldier was seriously injured in the incident. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said, 'There is fighting, and we have the upper hand in these battles. We also have casualties, and we pay a heavy price.' He added, 'There are quite a few Radwan terrorists who have surrendered, and more than 1,500 Hezbollah operatives that we have eliminated so far. We go through all the villages in a systematic and thorough manner so that we can tell the residents of the north that we have cleaned this area.' 'We will continue to do this in parallel with our actions of eliminating the commanders in Beirut,' Hagari said. Since the beginning of the ground war in Lebanon, 22 IDF soldiers have been killed in battle.

Israel reveals 6 Al Jazeera journalists as members of Hamas and I...	The IDF disclosed that documents found in Gaza confirmed that the journalists were members of the terror organizations. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Wednesday alleged that six Al Jazeera journalists are members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, two Islamist terrorist organizations, citing documents it uncovered in Gaza. The IDF said on X/Twitter that it had obtained documents and intelligence information revealing that the six journalists — Anas Jamal Mahmoud Al-Sharif, Alaa Abdul Aziz Muhammad Salama, Hossam Basel Abdul Karim Shabat, Ashraf Sami Ashour Saraj, Ismail Farid Muhammad Abu Omar, and Talal Mahmoud Abdul Rahman Aruki — are members of the Palestinian terrorist groups, arguing the revelations call into question the credibility and impartiality of Al Jazeera’s reporting in Gaza. 'The IDF has disclosed intelligence information and numerous documents found in Gaza confirming military affiliation of six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad terrorist organizations, including personnel tables, lists of terrorist training courses, phone directories, and salary documents for terrorists,' the IDF wrote on X/Twitter. 'These documents serve as proof of the integration of Hamas terrorists within the Qatari Al Jazeera media network,' the Israeli military added. 'Most of the journalists that the IDF has exposed as operatives in Hamas’ military wing spearhead the propaganda for Hamas at Al Jazeera, especially in northern Gaza.' Abu Omar suffered injuries during an IDF strike in February and underwent surgery for a leg amputation. Al Jazeera English defended him by writing on social media that 'Israeli aggression will not quash journalistic endeavors in the Gaza Strip.' The IDF subsequently accused Abu Omar of serving as a deputy commander within Hamas’s Eastern Battalion of Khan Yunis and even participating in the terrorist group’s Oct. 7 massacre in Israel last year. Eyewitnesses have accused the Al Jazeera reporter of helping facilitate the Hamas incursion into Israel. In August, the IDF accused Al Jazeera reporter Ismail al-Ghoul of doubling as a senior Hamas operative and alleged that he participated in the Oct. 7 onslaught. Al Jazeera slammed the IDF’s claims about its journalists as 'baseless' and argued that the Israeli military has exhibited a 'pattern of hostility.' 'The Network views these fabricated accusations as a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region, thereby obscuring the harsh realities of the war from audiences worldwide,' added in a statement. Approximately one-third of journalists killed during the war in Gaza were employed by Hamas-affiliated media such as Al-Aqsa Voice Radio, Al-Quds Al-Youm, Al-Aqsa Television, and Quds News, according to reporting by Jewish Insider. Al-Aqsa Television was designated by the US Department of Treasury for being controlled and financed by Hamas. Last month, the IDF conducted a raid on the Al Jazeera offices in the city of Ramallah in the West Bank. The IDF accused Al Jazeera of using the offices 'to incite terror' and ordered them closed for 45 days. Al Jazeera decried the allegations as 'unfounded' and lambasted the IDF for allegedly suppressing freedom of press.

IDF kills 3 Hezbollah sector commanders, eliminates 70 other terr...	The IDF said it was continuing 'limited, localized, targeted raids against Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure and operatives.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF announced Wednesday that it had neutralized three Hezbollah sector commanders and killed 70 other terrorists since Tuesday. The Hezbollah commanders led terrorist operations in Jibchit, Jouaiya, and Qana and launched many anti-tank missiles and rockets into Israel. Khalil Mohammad Amhaz, a high-ranking officer in Hezbollah's aerial unit, was eliminated by the IAF. Amhaz played a central role in launching intelligence-gathering and explosive drones into Israel. In the last 48 hours, 70 other terrorists were killed in ground operations by the IDF's 36th Division, and Israel's military said it was continuing 'limited, localized, targeted raids against Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure and operatives.' During the operations, IDF troops destroyed tunnel infrastructure and discovered weapons caches. Hezbollah has held onto less than 30% of its firepower. In the three weeks since the beginning of the ground war in Lebanon, the IDF has killed 1,200 terrorists, with 2,000 Hezbollah terrorists eliminated since October 7, 2023. Despite these significant achievements, the IDF emphasizes that Hezbollah maintains the capability to fire rockets at both forces and the Israeli home front. The IDF estimates that the ground operation in Lebanon will conclude within a 'very few' weeks. Israeli jets struck Hezbollah's main naval base in Beirut overnight, the Israel Defense Forces said on Tuesday morning. Israeli forces destroyed the base's headquarters, ammunition depots, underground infrastructure, and fast vessels. 'The unit vessels are designed to attack naval vessels and naval and strategic targets in Israel's maritime space,' the IDF said. Civilians were warned to evacuate the area ahead of the attack. Hezbollah's maritime assets are geared toward coastal defense, anti-ship operations, and guerrilla-style attacks rather than open-sea engagements. The Iran-backed terror group is known to have naval commandos and anti-ship missile systems. Reports suggest Hezbollah has also been developing or acquiring unmanned underwater vehicles for covert operations. Hezbollah has also launched drone attacks on Israel's offshore natural gas fields. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily.

Dr. Falah posted a picture of fallen IDF officer Colonel Ehsan Daxa and wrote,'May this be the fate of every criminal – resistance is avenged.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Ethics Bureau of the Israel Medical Association is requesting the suspension of the license of Dr. Batla Falah after she celebrated news of the death of Israel's highest-ranking casualty so far in the Gaza war. Dr. Falah, who previously worked at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer but is now employed abroad, posted on Instagram an image of Colonel Ehsan Daxa with the caption, 'May this be the fate of every criminal – resistance is avenged.' Colonel Daxa, commander of the 401st Armored Brigade, fell battling terrorists in Gaza. The head of the Daliyat al-Carmel council eulogized him: 'A hero, brave, a fighter who became a legend, a humble man who fought since the beginning of the war.' Chairman of the Ethics Bureau Dr. Yossef Walfisch issued a letter of complaint about Dr. Falah to Israel's Health Ministry, citing a regulation adopted in 2014 that doctors should exercise care when posting on social media and restraint during politically volatile periods. Freedom of speech is a right for all citizens, including doctors,' wrote Dr. Walfisch. 'However, doctors must speak respectfully and responsibly, particularly in professional contexts.' Health Minister Uriel Busso also contacted the Director General of the Health Ministry and the Israel Medical Association and requested a thorough investigation into Dr. Falah. The Health Ministry is considering suspending her license and adopting stricter rules about what doctors may post on social media. In August, an Arab-Israeli doctor working at an Israeli hospital was indicted for membership in a terrorist organization after he was discovered to be a member of the radical Islamist terror group ISIS (Islamic State In Syria). Prosecutors released details from the charge sheet against Muhammad Azzam, a 34-year-old resident doctor at Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba. Born in Nazareth in northern Israel and now residing in Beersheba, Azzam was arrested by Israeli police and the Shin Bet internal security agency amid suspicions Azzam had ties to ISIS.

Amid loss of highest-ranking Israeli casualty in Gaza war, Druze ...	Druze men have a conscription rate of more than 80%, which is roughly 10 percentage points higher than that of the general male population in Israel, many serving in combat roles. By Canaan Lidor, JNS In the grieving Druze town of Daliyat al-Karmel, on Mount Carmel southeast of Haifa, Sabura Abu Hamad closed her empty café early on Monday to attend the funeral of the highest-ranking Israeli casualty in the current war. 'It’s a huge loss, but we remain strong,' Abu Hamad, 53, said of the death of Col. Ehsan Daxa, a 41-year-old father of three who died fighting Hamas terrorists in Gaza on Sunday. His death reminded Abu Hamad of her family’s own sacrifices for Israel. Her father was murdered and his body mutilated by terrorists in Lebanon while serving in the Israel Defense Forces when she, the youngest of four siblings, was in her mother’s womb. Her father’s head was never recovered. Her mother has been wearing black since her husband’s death and rarely smiles, said Abu Hamad. Her mix of personal, communal and national grief is shared by many Israeli Druze, a 150,000-strong ethno-religious minority with a rich military tradition. Their alliance with the Jews predates the state’s establishment and is often described as a fraternal bond of shared fate. In several places along the main street of this town of some 20,000 residents, giant television screens showed pictures of Daxa. Admired as a local success story, he was also a trailblazer and role model for having climbed the ranks in the IDF Armored Corps, where relatively few Druze serve. The streets of Daliyat al-Karmel (Arabic for 'Vineyards of the Carmel') were congested with traffic for the funeral, which drew thousands of Druze and Jews from across the country to this hilly tourist spot that visitors normally frequent for its excellent restaurants and shops. In her eulogy, Daxa’s widow, Hudah, spoke of how her husband, a decorated war hero, managed to always be present at his home and his community despite his long absences as a career officer during wartime. 'I want to ask that the journey that he had made, that he chose, not be in vain,' she said, explaining that she wants others to follow in his footsteps to ensure a better future for all Israelis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement called Daxa 'an Israeli hero, a fighter and a commander—a model for the lifelong alliance with the Druze minority.' Although Druze women are exempt from mandatory military service, Druze men are mandatorily conscripted along with Jewish ones. The men have a conscription rate of more than 80%, which is roughly 10 percentage points higher than that of the general male population in Israel. And many, many serve in combat roles. The conflict that broke out on Oct. 7, 2023, has taken a heavy toll on Israel’s Druze. Among the hundreds of IDF casualties, 12 Druze soldiers have been killed in action. In addition to Col. Daxa, two lieutenant colonels, two majors and two captains have also died, along with five additional combatants. Twelve Druze children were murdered in August in the town of Majdal Shams in the Golan by terrorists in Lebanon who fired a rocket at the local soccer pitch. It was the deadliest attack on an Israeli target since the massacres of October 2023, in which thousands of Hamas terrorists murdered some 1,200 people in Israel and abducted another 251 into Gaza. Hezbollah and other terrorists in Lebanon began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023. Israel has been fighting Hamas and Hezbollah and exchanging fire with Iran in an ongoing regional conflict that has been one of the longest in the state’s history. The war has hit the Druze minority disproportionately not only because of the casualties but also because it has suspended tourism in Israel’s north, where the community is concentrated and where the livelihood of whole towns depends largely on outside visitors. Abu Hamad is 'hanging in there financially,' she said at her centrally located Shafiq café, which is known for its knafeh, a Middle Eastern cheesy dessert. Hiba Halabi, a restaurant owner who specializes in Druze cuisine, including stuffed cabbage and so-called Druze pita, can barely make ends meet, she said. Several interviewees in Daliyat al-Karmel said that despite the hardships it has created, the war only cemented the Druze-Jewish partnership. In the Golan especially, 'the war crystalized integration processes that have been underway for decades,' said former Communications Minister Ayoob Kara, a prominent Druze politician in the Likud party who had served until 2019 as a cabinet minister under Netanyahu. It was a reference to how about 20,000 Golan Druze had for many years presented themselves as Syrians under Israeli occupation amid fears that Israel would return the Golan to Syria. That country’s Druze had been allies of the regime of President Bashar Assad. As part of that narrative, the vast majority of Golan Druze had refrained from voting in local elections or taking up the Israeli citizenship to which they’re entitled. That started changing following the de facto breakup of Syria in its civil war that began in 2011. This year, the four Golan Druze communities had more than 1,400 Israeli citizens, compared to only about 200 in 2006. In the local elections, more than 3,000 Golan Druze voted, compared to 277 in 2009. Syrian flags, which were once commonplace in the Golan Druze communities, have all but disappeared there, Yusri Hazran, a lecturer on Druze culture at Shalem College in Jerusalem, told Globes in August. Following the rocket strike in Majdal Shams, this reporter heard locals expressing themselves in public in ways that had been unthinkable. One told the media under his real name that 'Israel should burn Lebanon.' Another said that Israel should 'destroy Hezbollah.' Back in Daliyat al-Karmel, the continuation of the war is subject to the same debates taking place across the rest of Israeli society. Abu Hamad, who has in her café a large picture of Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein smoking cigarettes together, thinks it’s time to end hostilities. 'Enough blood has been shed,' she told JNS. Radi Mishilah, a retired postman and poet in his 70s, thinks the IDF should pull out of Gaza to retrieve the hostages in a deal, but keep fighting against Hezbollah in Lebanon and retaliate against Iran. Kara believes Israel must keep fighting on all fronts 'until the collapse of all of its enemies, which is within sight.' This is imperative for Israel’s survival, he said, 'but also that of the Druze because we have no alternatives: Only a strong Jewish Israel will ensure a free Druze community. Otherwise, we’re condemning ourselves to the ruthless oppression that has been the sorry fate of each and every religious minority in this region.' Yet some locals feel discriminated against. Mishilah said he feels like a 'third-rate citizen' because of the authorities’ refusal to connect one of his homes to the electricity grid or give him building permits— a common issue in Druze-majority municipalities, where many feel subject to unjust land policies. 'Every time one of us dies defending Israel, there’s talk for a week about the sacred Jewish-Druze alliance of blood, and then we’re again treated like dirt,' he complained. These long-simmering issues have resurfaced following the passing in 2018 of Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People, which critics say marginalized the Druze. In November, Netanyahu’s coalition said it would amend the law to enshrine the status of Druze Israelis. Some community leaders, including Kara, disagree that the law needs amending or that it disenfranchised the Druze. 'The left has taken some Druze for a ride, using them in their identity politics to shoot down processes and legislation that can only benefit the community,' he told JNS. Ultimately, Kara said, 'the war has sidelined these made-up divisions, and underlined the undying alliance between the Druze and the Jewish and democratic State of Israel and its society.'

12 US lawmakers demand probe into IDF Lebanon strike	Bernie Sanders and eleven Democratic lawmakers call on Biden administration to launch investigation into IDF strike on Hezbollah that hit journalists operating in Lebanon. By World Israel News Staff Twelve U.S. members of Congress are calling on the Biden administration to launch a formal investigation into an Israeli strike in Lebanon which killed a journalist and injured several others, including one carrying American citizenship. On October 13th, 2023, a week after Hamas invaded southwestern Israel and six days after Hezbollah terrorists began attacking northern Israel with rockets, missiles, mortar fire, and cross-border infiltrations, IDF forces came under attack outside Kibbutz Hanita near the Lebanon border. IDF tanks and artillery batteries returned fire, hitting a group of journalists covering the fighting on the Israel-Lebanon frontier. Seven journalists were injured in the strike, including of them – Reuters reporter Issam Abdallah – who was fatally injured. Of the six others, one, Dylan Collins, a writer for AFP, held American citizenship. The IDF lamented the incident, saying the journalists had been accidentally hit and were not targeted by Israeli forces. The Israeli military 'deplores any injury to uninvolved parties, and does not deliberately shoot at civilians, including journalists,' an army spokesperson said. 'The IDF considers the freedom of the press to be of utmost importance while clarifying that being in a war zone is dangerous.' The IDF’s General Staff’s Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism was assigned to examine the incident, the army said. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (Independent) on Tuesday led a group of twelve lawmakers in calling on the federal Department of Justice to open a probe into the Israeli strike. 'It has now been more than one year since Mr. Collins was injured in a targeted Israeli strike while on assignment for AFP,' Sanders wrote in a letter addressed to President Joe Biden, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. 'To date, Mr. Collins has received no explanation for the attack, and there have been no steps toward accountability. Given the inaction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, the United States must open an independent investigation into this incident.' In addition to Sanders, eleven Democratic senators and House representatives signed onto the letter, including Sens. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Reps. Becca Balint (D-Vt.), Cori Bush (D-Mo.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), and Rashida Tlaib. (D-Mich.). The lawmakers also accused the IDF of a 'wider pattern of disregard' for civilians, 'including journalists and humanitarian aid workers.'

Calls to ban UN official who compared Israel to Nazi Germany from...	UN rapporteur who endorsed Hamas' 'right to resist' and compared Israel to Nazi Germany should be barred from entering the US, watchdog group says. By World Israel News Staff A United Nations official who endorsed Hamas' 'right to resist' against Israel and who compared the Jewish state to Nazi Germany is facing calls to ban her from entering the United States. Last week, UN rapporteur Francesca Albanese was widely condemned after she posted a comment to X/Twitter, accusing Israel of genocide and comparing the country to Nazi Germany. 'Because of their history, one might have thought Germans & Italians would be at the forefront of the opposition to the Netanyahu-driven assault on Gaza, which is now metastasising across the region.' 'Our collective obliviousness to what led, 100 years ago, to the Third Reich's expansionism and the genocide of people not in conformity with the 'pure race' is asinine. And it is leading to the commision of yet another genocide, yet another regional war and potentially yet another global one. Shame on all those who are making it happen.' The comments were condemned by the United States and France, along with a number of major American Jewish organizations. 'Antisemitism has no place at the UN, especially from those tasked with promoting human rights,' tweeted Ambassador Michele Taylor, head of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Council. 'Francesca Albanese's recent remarks, including evoking Nazis, show yet again that she is unfit for any role at the UN. The U.S. has never supported her mandate, and her conduct is unacceptable.' 'Francesca Albanese has a history of using antisemitic tropes. Her most recent statements justifying, dismissing, & denying the antisemitic undertones of Hamas' October 7 attack are unacceptable & antisemitic. We expect more of independent UN experts and condemn all forms of antisemitism.' On Wednesday, the human rights group UN Watch called on the U.S. to bar entry to Albanese. The group justified its call with the release of a 60-page report documenting not only an anti-Israel bias and past statements suggesting support for terrorist groups including Hamas, but also antisemitic comments, including claims that the U.S. has been 'subjugated by the Jewish lobby.' In November 2022, the UN Watch report noted, Albanese told a Hamas conference, 'You have a right to resist.' On October 7th, as the invasion of Israel was underway, Albanese rushed to defend Hamas, saying, 'Today’s violence must be put in context.' 'Never before in the history of the United Nations did France, Germany and the U.S. condemn a UN human rights monitor for racism or antisemitism,' said Hillel C. Neuer, executive director of UN Watch. 'Francesca Albanese is the first. She is today the most dangerous figure on the world stage inciting antisemitism and jihadi terrorism.' Albanese is set to speak in front of the United Nations in the U.S. on October 30. A college tour will take her to multiple U.S. campuses including Georgetown University on October 26, Princeton on October 29, and Toronto on November 7. In a statement Wednesday, UN Watch warned of 'the possibility that Albanese will incite terrorism and antisemitism on campuses.'

‘Enemy From Within’ – Trump rips leaking of Israel’s retaliatory ...	Former President Trump condemns leaking of Israel’s military plans, demands Biden administration track down the source. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday condemned the leaking of sensitive Israeli military documents shared with the United States, saying the source of the leak was an 'enemy from within' the American security establishment. Last Friday, classified documents in the possession of the Pentagon were leaked to a pro-Iranian Telegram channel via an account operating under the handle 'The Middle East Spectator.' The documents, dated to October 15th and 16th, included details regarding Israel’s plans for its retaliation against Iran over the October 1st ballistic missile attacks. Israel had provided the drafts to security officials from five English-speaking allied nations: The United States, Australia, Britain, New Zealand, and Canada. Taking to his Truth Social account on Tuesday, Trump condemned the leak and demanded the Biden administration find the source of the leak. 'U.S. leaked highly confidential Documents from Israel,' Trump wrote. 'May have come from Defense Department. Israel has been seriously damaged and compromised by this.' 'Wartime strategy and data. Probably came from Defense Department. MUST FIND THE LEAKER! Israel no longer wants to share documents with U.S., and who can blame them!' Trump also addressed the leak during a campaign stop in Miami, saying the party responsible is an 'enemy from within' the U.S. security establishment. 'They leaked all the information about the way that Israel's going to fight and how they are going to fight and where they are going to go. And somebody - who did that? Can you imagine somebody doing that?' 'That’s the enemy, I guess that maybe is the enemy from within, as I talk about. We have an enemy from within, they hate to talk about it. Could you imagine, could you imagine.'

Iran and Saudi Arabia to hold joint Red Sea military drills	Tehran claims long-time rivals will hold naval exercises together; Riyadh yet to confirm report. By World Israel News Staff Iran and Saudi Arabia will hold naval exercises in the Red Sea, in what would mark the first time the two countries - which have a long history of hostility towards each other - will collaborate in a military setting. 'Saudi Arabia has asked that we organize joint exercises in the Red Sea,' the commander of Iran’s navy, Admiral Shahram Irani, told state-controlled Iranian news agency ISNA. 'Coordination efforts are currently in progress, and delegations from both countries will engage in necessary discussions regarding the execution of the exercise,' he added. Irani did not provide a timeframe or additional details regarding the drills. Riyadh has yet to confirm the report. The drills come after years of tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who were engaged in a bloody proxy conflict in Yemen for nearly a decade. From 2016 to 2023, the two countries official suspended diplomatic relations with each other, mutually withdrawing their ambassadors and closing their embassies. Saudi Arabia and Iran officially re-established diplomatic relations in a China-brokered March 2023 agreement, but the level of trust between the two nations remains unclear. While Saudi Arabia does not officially recognize Israel, Riyadh and Jerusalem are believed to maintain extensive under-the-radar ties, primarily around security cooperation. It's unclear how Iran's emnity towards Israel will affect Saudi Arabia's relationship with the Jewish State. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi recently repeated Tehran's messaging blaming Israel for tensions in the region. 'We have done our best to reduce the tension, but we are prepared to deal with any scenario,' Araghchi said during a press conference in Kuwait. 'Our message is very clear: the Zionist regime is seeking to expand the war in the region, and we must stop this disaster,' he added. Araghchi failed to mention Iran's two unprecedented ballistic missile attacks on Israel in 2024, most recently at the beginning of October, nor the country's policy of arming and training proxy groups hostile to Israel.

2 Israeli reserve soldiers killed in northern fighting	Father-of-six fell in battle in southern Lebanon; reservist killed by Hezbollah missile in northern Israel. By World Israel News Staff Two Israeli reservists were killed on Tuesday along the northern front, the IDF announced in a press statement. Major Rabbi Aviram Hariv, 43, of Dolev, and Master Sergeant Saar Eliad Navarsky, 27, from Tel Aviv were killed in separate incidents in Lebanon and northern Israel. Hariv fell in battle in southern Lebanon, while Navarsky was killed by a direct hit from a Hezbollah missile in northern Israel's Hula Valley. A father of six, Hariv was the Deputy Commander of the 9308th Battalion's 228th Alon Brigade. He is survived by his wife, Ayelet, and their children Achinoam, 18, Ziv, 15, Shahar, 11, Ori, 9, Amit, 7, and Ivri, 4. He served as the rabbi of a religious girls' school in his hometown of Dolev, in Judea and Samaria. 'The people of Israel lost a great educator who took the values he taught to the battlefield,' said Binyamin Regional Council Head Israel Ganz. Hariv was 'a man of the book and sword. We embrace his dear wife Ayelet and his six beloved children. Rabbi Aviram leaves us with a great loss and a great legacy - to continue the victory for Israel's resurrection.' Navarsky, who served in the 508th Battalion of the 7338th Adirim Brigade, was a free-spirited, unconventional man, according to his friends and family. He is survived by his mother, Sapir, sister Shoval, and girlfriend Sol. Navarsky's father died several years ago. 'He was a vegan and his dream was to buy a caravan, travel around, and wake up each morning to a different view,' his mother told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'He was always smiling, never angry. The last time I saw him was three weeks ago, at his favorite cousin's wedding in Jaffa.' A nature lover, Navarsky wrote to a friend shortly before he was killed that he was enjoying the greenery of southern Lebanon. 'It's scary here but I'm not letting the fear control me,' he said in a message. 'I'm thinking positively and hoping for the best.' Also on Tuesday, Staff Sergeant Yishai Mann was killed in a military-related traffic accident in southern Israel, near Gaza. Mann, from Mitzpe Yericho, was 21 years old.

New poll shows Trump leading majority of swing states	The race remains virtually even in Michigan and Pennsylvania, two crucial Rust Belt states that could ultimately decide the election. By Jewish Breaking News After weeks of polling neck and neck in the battleground states, Republican candidate Donald Trump has taken the lead in a majority of them. According to a Tuesday poll conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies shows the former president leading in Georgia and Nevada, where he commands 48% and 47% of voter support respectively. Trump’s position appears strongest in Arizona and North Carolina, where he holds three-point advantages with 49% and 48% of voters backing his candidacy. The race remains virtually even in Michigan and Pennsylvania, two crucial Rust Belt states that could ultimately decide the election. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris maintains a razor-thin one-point lead in Wisconsin, where she leads 47% to Trump’s 46%. Concerns over the economy and personal finances have emerged as the biggest issues for those casting ballots in the November 5 presidential election. Before casting their ballots, voters across all seven battleground states say they will weigh whether they are better off financially than four years ago. Many voters appeared to blame the Biden-Harris administration, with a plurality of voters saying they did not believe the cost of living would have increased to the same degree if Trump had been in office. Between 42% and 50% in all seven swing states said their financial situation has worsened in the last year. Even more telling, a majority ranging from 54% to 63% have cut back on grocery spending due to rising costs. The second most important concern for voters was access to abortion, which has been sharply curtailed since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, followed by immigration.

FBI announces investigation into leak of classified US intel on I...	It is not currently known if more confidential Israeli documents are in the alleged leaker's possession. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Tuesday announced a probe into the leak of highly classified US intelligence documents describing Israel’s plans for a retaliatory strike on Iran. 'The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community,' the FBI said in a statement. 'As this is an ongoing investigation, we have no further comment.' Documents pertaining to Israel’s planned response to Iran, which earlier this month fired a salvo of 181 ballistic missiles at the Jewish state in a large-scale attack, were leaked and circulated around a pro-Iran Telegram channel last Friday. The confidential documents, dated Oct. 15 and 16, were considered 'top secret' and were only intended to be seen by high-ranking officials in the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The leaked documents reportedly outlines Israel’s plans to deploy aircraft and weapons against Iran but did not expose its planned targets within Iran. However, it is not currently known if more confidential Israeli documents are within the possession of the alleged leaker. Thus far, the identity of the alleged leaker has yet to be publicly revealed. Some media outlets reported that a high-ranking Pentagon official’s security clearance was suspended after an investigation indicated she was the one who likely leaked the intelligence. However, Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin emphatically denied the reports as 'not true' on X/Twitter. 'This story is NOT TRUE,' Griffin wrote. 'I have spoken with the person the reporter alleges was behind the leak of Israeli preparations and she is at work at the Pentagon today, has her security clearance and has NOT been contacted by … investigators.' The Pentagon on Tuesday denied that Ariane Tabatabai, chief of staff of the assistant secretary of defense for special operations, was a 'subject of interest' in the investigation. 'To my knowledge, this official is not a subject of interest,' Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Tuesday afternoon White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Monday that the document leaks were 'unacceptable.' 'That is not supposed to happen, and it’s unacceptable when it does,' Kirby told reporters. 'And you can rest assured that he [US President Joe Biden] will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened, and obviously he’ll be very interested in hearing any mitigation measures and recommendations that come as a result of the investigative efforts and how to prevent it from happening again.' The investigation into the leak came after Robert Malley, the diplomat who led the Biden administration’s negotiations with Iran, was suspended from his role as US special envoy and placed on leave last year over his handling of classified information. Malley’s security clearance was suspended, although details remain murky about what happened. US lawmakers in Congress had demanded greater transparency from the State Department to inform them why the senior official was removed from his position.

IDF confirms death of Hezbollah executive council chief	The strike killed 25 Hezbollah terrorists, including Safieddine and Ali Hussein Hazima, commander of Hezbollah’s intelligence headquarters. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces announced on Tuesday that it killed a group of Hezbollah commanders, including Hashem Safieddine, the head of Hezbollah’s chief executive council. 'The terrorists were eliminated in a strike carried out approximately three weeks ago in the area of Dahiyeh, a key Hezbollah terrorist stronghold in Beirut,' the IDF stated. 'The Israeli Air Force conducted a precise, intelligence-based strike on Hezbollah’s main intelligence headquarters, deliberately located underground beneath the civilian population in the Dahiyeh.' The strike killed 25 Hezbollah terrorists, including Safieddine and Ali Hussein Hazima, commander of Hezbollah’s intelligence headquarters, per the IDF. Safieddine was a first cousin of Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s secretary-general who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September. The IDF said Safieddine frequently served as acting secretary-general of Hezbollah when Nasrallah was outside Lebanon. Hashem Safieddine’s brother, Abdullah Safieddine, is the terror group’s representative in Tehran. Hashem’s eldest son, Reza, is married to a daughter of former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, killed by the United States in a 2020 airstrike in Iraq. The confirmation of Hashem Safieddine’s death, which Israeli leaders first said was 'likely' back on Oct. 8, is the latest blow to Hezbollah’s leadership cadre. In September, more than 3,000 Hezbollah operatives were wounded when their pagers and walkie-talkies exploded. Jerusalem has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for that operation, though Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the day after the mass beeper explosions that Israel’s security services have achieved 'very impressive' results. On Sept. 27, Israel killed Nasrallah in an airstrike on Hezbollah’s underground headquarters in Dahiyeh, on the same day that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Hashem Safieddine was believed to be a potential successor to Nasrallah. With his killing, Gallant said on Oct. 8 that Hezbollah has 'no one to make decisions, no one to act.' 'The actions we are taking are being observed all over the Middle East,' Gallant said. 'When the smoke in Lebanon clears, they will realize in Iran that they have lost their most valuable asset, which is Hezbollah.'

Sinwar may have given order to execute remaining hostages if he d...	Baskin: 'The present situation is a moment of either opportunity or doom.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told the Telegraph Hamas leader and October 7th mastermind Yahya Sinwar might have told Hamas terrorists to execute remaining hostages if he was killed. Baskin, who assisted with 2011 negotiations for the release of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit in exchange for Yahya Sinwar and 1,026 other Palestinian prisoners, said there are rumors that Sinwar might have left these orders and believes it could be the case based on Hamas's execution of six hostages in August. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Ori Danino, Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, Alexander Lobanov, and Carmel Gat were executed by their captors, sensing the approach of IDF soldiers a few days earlier. In addition, Baskin pointed out that after the death of Yahya Sinwar, his brother, Mohammed, is likely in charge of the remaining hostages. Baskin describes the situation after the killing of Yahya Sinwar as 'a moment of either opportunity or doom,' depending on whether the report that the Hamas leader left instructions on the fate of the hostages is accurate or not. Following news of Yahya Sinwar's death, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered safe passage for any Gazan who handed over the remaining hostages. Baskin recommended a new ceasefire and hostage release agreement and said it would require the US to put pressure on Israel for compliance. 'It's a moment of opportunity where Israel should be issuing a very clear call that anyone who's holding a hostage that releases them will be given free passage for themselves and their family out of Gaza to another country, as well as a lot of money,' he told The Telegraph. Baskin said the US has significant leverage to apply on Israel, but was uncertain whether they would use it. In his address following Yahya Sinwar's demise, Netanyahu clearly stated that the war is not over. He said, 'Today, evil suffered a heavy blow, but our mission is not yet completed.' 'The war, the war, my dear ones, is not yet finished,' he continued, quoting King David: 'I will pursue my enemies and destroy them. And I will not turn back until they are wiped out.'

By JNS The drone attack launched by Hezbollah from Lebanon on Oct. 19 targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea scored a direct hit on the home, the military censor cleared for publication on Tuesday. Following the attempted assassination, security measures for government ministers and other officials have been 'significantly' reinforced. 'Iran tried to eliminate the prime minister of Israel. It will not escape responsibility,' a senior Israeli government official told Ynet. According to reports, the assault included three drones, one of which scored a direct hit on a bedroom window at the Caesarea residence. Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, were not home at the time. 'The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake,' the prime minister said in a statement on Saturday. 'This will not deter me or the State of Israel from continuing our just war against our enemies in order to secure our future. 'I say to Iran and its proxies in its axis of evil: Anyone who tries to harm Israel’s citizens will pay a heavy price,' Netanyahu warned. Hezbollah media chief Mohammed Afif during a press conference in Beirut on Tuesday declared the Iranian-backed terrorist organization’s 'full, complete and exclusive responsibility for the Caesarea operation.' The Lebanese terrorist spokesman also warned, 'If we did not reach you this time, then we will reach you the next time. Between us lie the days, nights and the battlefield.' The Saudi state-owned Al-Hadath television news channel reported earlier on Tuesday that diplomatic officials at the Iranian embassy in Lebanon were directly involved in the attempt on Netanyahu’s life. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Saturday that he was relieved Netanyahu was 'safe after the attack that reportedly targeted his home in Caesarea this morning,' Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said on Saturday. House Speaker Mike Johnson, former President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis also condemned the attack on Netanyahu, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement on Monday.

The festive parade is held during the week-long holiday of Sukkot. For many Christians, Sukkot has special significance due to its prophetic association with the gathering of nations in Jerusalem. 'Our desire to be here is bigger than our fear,' Vivian Mayber from South Africa told The Press Service of Israel as she walked with her country’s flag through Jerusalem’s Gan Sacher Park.

Kamala Harris to receive lowest share of Jewish vote for a Democr...	Harris has received criticism from some within the Jewish community for what they see as her insufficient support of Israel. By Jack Elbaum, The Algemeiner US Vice President Kamala Harris is leading former US President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race among Jewish voters by a margin of 67 percent to 31 percent, according to a new Manhattan Institute poll. Such an outcome among Jewish voters would represent the highest vote share for a Republican candidate — and the lowest for a Democratic candidate — since 1988, when Michael Dukakis ran against George H.W. Bush and received 64 percent of the Jewish vote. While Jews have long been one of the most supportive groups of the Democratic Party, there are also divisions by denomination. Orthodox Jews prefer Trump by a 59-41 margin, while Reform Jews prefer Harris by a 75-22 margin, according to the data. The poll found that if Trump chose Nikki Haley, rather than US Sen. JD Vance, as his running mate, then Jewish voters would have preferred Harris by a smaller 65-30 margin. Despite numbers trending toward Trump and Republicans, the poll confirmed that Jewish voters remain a strongly Democratic voting group — which is in line with other recent polls of Jewish voters. In September, the Jewish Democratic Council of America released a poll showing Harris leading Trump by a 72-25 margin. Harris has received criticism from some within the Jewish community for what they see as her insufficient support of Israel. However, others have pointed out that the Biden-Harris administration has given Israel significant material and diplomatic support since Hamas launched its war against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Other key findings in the poll include the fact that 86 percent of Jews said they consider themselves to be a supporter of Israel, while just 5 percent said they do not consider themselves to be a supporter and 9 percent marked down they were unsure. Support remains strong across parties and denominations, with 91 percent of Orthodox, 93 percent of Conservative, and 87 percent of Reform Jews considering themselves supporters of Israel. The only group that expressed notably less support for the Jewish state were those who do not consider themselves a part of a denomination — among which 76 percent said they are supporters of Israel. Similarly, 94 percent of Jewish Republicans and 83 percent of Jewish Democrats responded that they consider themselves to be supporters of Israel. The proportion of Jewish Democrats who support Israel is of particular note because of rising anti-Israel sentiment within the grassroots of the Democratic Party. Democrats under the age of 35, for example, sympathize more with the Palestinians over Israel by a 74-16 margin, according to recent polling. There is a key partisan divide when it comes to approaches to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. A majority of Jewish Republicans (54 percent) said they increase antisemitism, while just 11 percent of Jewish Democrats said the same. On the other hand, a majority of Jewish Democrats said it either has no impact on antisemitism or that they are unsure. Twenty-six percent said it decreased antisemitism. The poll was conducted with 658 Jewish registered voters nationwide between Oct. 6 and Oct. 8, with a margin of error of +/-3.8 percent.

Ex-boxing champ gives Israeli rescue group 100 bulletproof vests	Your presence shows that even in difficult times, we can find strength in unity,' said Eli Beer, United Hatzalah president and founder. By JNS American boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. is donating $100,000 to buy 100 bulletproof vests for Israeli medical volunteers on the front lines, in his latest show of support for the Jewish state. The gift was announced on Monday evening, at an annual Jerusalem concert for the United Hatzalah volunteer emergency-rescue service that raised funds for the purchase of 1,000 protective kits for its volunteers. About 3,000 people attended the sold-out event organized by the Jerusalem-based service at the city’s International Convention Center, which included performances by Israeli singers Ishay Ribo, Gad Elbaz and Shmuel Star. 'Your presence shows that even in difficult times, we can find strength in unity,' said Eli Beer, United Hatzalah president and founder. 'Let’s continue to stand together for our soldiers, our volunteers and our community.'

Hezbollah retains less than 30% of its firepower, IDF says	Despite these significant achievements, the IDF emphasizes that Hezbollah maintains the capability to fire rockets at both forces and the Israeli home front. By Lilach Shoval, JNS Hezbollah retains less than 30% of its firepower, and since the beginning of the ground operation in Southern Lebanon about three weeks ago, approximately 1,200 terrorist operatives have been killed, with about 2,000 Hezbollah operatives eliminated in the past year, the IDF said on Monday. According to military data, numerous Hezbollah commanders have been slain, including seven sector commanders (equivalent to brigade commanders), 21 sub-sector commanders (equivalent to battalion commanders) and 25 company commander equivalents and deputy battalion commanders. This significantly impacts the organization’s field command structure, the army said. Despite these significant achievements, the IDF emphasizes that Hezbollah maintains the capability to fire rockets at both forces and the Israeli home front. The IDF estimates that the ground operation in Lebanon will conclude within a 'very few' weeks. A controversial weapon Meanwhile, security sources revealed to Israel Hayom that Hezbollah fired cluster bombs at IDF forces operating in Southern Lebanon earlier this week. Following this incident, the IDF conducted several strategic assessments to evaluate the continuation of operations and troop deployment. Cluster munitions cause extensive damage over a larger area compared to conventional weapons and are considered illegitimate by many countries. Following the 2006 Second Lebanon War, an American rights organization reported that Hezbollah had launched Chinese-manufactured 122mm cluster bombs into Israeli territory during the conflict. Each bomb contained 39 submunitions and hundreds of steel pellets. The organization’s representative in Israel stated that at least 100 such bombs were found in Israel. Israel has previously faced criticism for its use of cluster munitions, particularly during the Second Lebanon War. The cluster rockets used by the IDF at that time contained several hundred submunitions, which dispersed within a radius of approximately 100 meters (328 feet) above the target. The U.N. reported that the dud rate of Israeli cluster munitions ranged between 20%-40%, resulting in more than 40 civilian deaths and approximately 300 injuries. After the war, a committee headed by then-Military Advocate General Avichai Mandelblit determined that the IDF’s use of cluster munitions complied with international law of war. However, the Winograd Commission, which investigated the Second Lebanon War events, strongly criticized the use of these munitions in population centers. In late May 2008, more than 100 countries agreed on a convention banning the use, production, distribution, or stockpiling of cluster munitions during a diplomatic conference. Israel, along with several other countries including the United States, did not sign the convention.

Israel strikes Hezbollah’s main naval base in Beirut	IDF destroys Hezbollah naval vessels and underground infrastructure at coastal base. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli jets struck Hezbollah’s main naval base in Beirut overnight, the Israel Defense Forces said on Tuesday morning. Destroyed in the attack were the base’s headquarters, ammunition depots, underground infrastructure, fast vessels, and other assets. 'The vessels of the unit are designed to attack naval vessels and naval and strategic targets in Israel’s maritime space,' the IDF said. Civilians were warned to evacuate the area ahead of the attack. Hezbollah’s maritime assets are geared toward coastal defense, anti-ship operations, and guerrilla-style attacks rather than open-sea engagements. The Iran-backed terror group is known to have naval commandos and anti-ship missile systems. Reports suggest Hezbollah has also been developing or acquiring unmanned underwater vehicles for covert operations. Hezbollah has also launched drone attacks on Israel’s offshore natural gas fields. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Hezbollah’s barrages have killed 59 people. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon.

Gaza ceasefire talks still stalled despite Sinwar’s death, says U...	The captives remain 'a top priority of President Biden,' National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. By JNS Negotiations between Israel and Hamas for a hostages-for-ceasefire-and-terrorists-release deal have yet to resume since Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s Oct. 16 death, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Monday. 'I cannot sit here today and tell you that negotiations are about to restart in Doha or Cairo, or anywhere else for that matter,' Kirby told reporters at a virtual briefing, adding that 'we have started to begin to think about it here and had some initial conversations with our Israeli counterparts, as you would expect we would, in the wake of that truly historic news. 'We have certainly expressed, as the president did publicly, our strong desire to see what can be done to find a diplomatic path forward here to get the hostages home,' the senior White House official said. The captives remain 'a top priority of President Biden. The Israelis understand that that remains a top priority of the president,' he added. Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) chief Ronen Bar visited Cairo on Sunday in an attempt to revive the talks. Bar, according to the Ynet, held an introductory meeting with Egyptian intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Hassan Mahmoud Rashad, who assumed the position last week, replacing Abbas Kamel, who had led Cairo’s powerful General Intelligence Directorate since June 2018. Ahead of a meeting of the Security Cabinet on Sunday night, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant met with senior security officials to discuss prospects for the release of the hostages from Hamas captivity. Gallant was joined by Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi; IDF Missing and Captive Soldiers Division head Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon; and Military Intelligence Directorate chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder, as well as other officials, his office said in a statement. Five hostages During the subsequent Cabinet meeting, government ministers were reportedly informed of an initial proposal for Hamas to release five hostages in return for a two-week cessation of hostilities in Gaza. The Cabinet was said to have tasked Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer with formulating a detailed response to the new proposal, with some ministers voicing reservations to a deal as the IDF’s campaign against Hamas is gaining momentum in the wake of Sinwar’s death. Ministers opposing the proposal, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, reportedly also expressed concerns about international and domestic pressure to end the war while allowing Hamas to recover its power. Sinwar, the mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in southern Israel, survived for more than a year until Israeli forces killed him during an encounter in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah on Oct. 16. During a phone call between U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the next day, the two leaders 'agreed that there is an opportunity to advance the release of the hostages and [to] work together to achieve this objective,' according to Jerusalem. The Wall Street Journal, citing documents discovered by IDF soldiers in Gaza, said on Sunday that Sinwar believed he had the upper hand in negotiations due to American and domestic pressure on Netanyahu. In a message to Hamas officials dated March, Sinwar urged negotiators to refuse a deal, citing internal political divisions within the Jewish state, discord in Netanyahu’s wartime government and mounting pressure from the Biden administration to address humanitarian concerns. In September, Sinwar began preparing for his possible death, advising fellow terrorists that while Jerusalem would likely offer concessions to end the war after he was gone, Hamas would be in a stronger position. Sinwar said the terrorist group was likely to face pressure to compromise but shouldn’t, according to Arab mediators who spoke with the Journal. Roughly 1,200 Israelis were murdered on Oct. 7, with thousands more wounded and some 251 others taken into the Gaza Strip. One hundred and one hostages, both living and dead, are still being held by Hamas.

Blinken lands in Israel to push for ceasefire deal after Sinwar’s...	US Secretary of State arrives in Israel for his 11th trip since October 7th, in a bid to renew hostage deal negotiations between Israel and Hamas. By The Associated Press U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Tuesday on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. He is expected to meet with top officials as the United States looks to revive ceasefire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, but so far none of the warring parties appear to be backing down on longstanding demands. Israel is still at war with Hamas more than a year after the terrorist group’s Oct. 7 attack, and with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where it launched a ground invasion earlier this month. Israel is also expected to strike Iran after its ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. Blinken landed just hours after Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel, setting off air raid sirens in the country’s most populated areas but causing no apparent damage or injuries. The Israeli military said it intercepted most of the five projectiles, with one landing in an open area. The military said another 15 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel at around the same time. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have brokered months of talks between Israel and Hamas, trying to strike a deal in which the terror group would release dozens of hostages in return for an end to the war, a lasting cease-fire and the release of jailed Palestinian terrorists. But both Israel and Hamas accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands over the summer, and the talks ground to a halt in August. The U.S. has also tried to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, but those efforts fell apart as tensions spiked last month with a series of Israeli strikes that killed the terror group’s top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel is currently waging another major operation in northern Gaza, aimed at curbing efforts by Hamas to reassert control over the area. In Lebanon, Israel has carried out waves of heavy airstrikes across southern Beirut and the country’s south and east, areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, including some that have reached the country’s populous center.

Operating under the guidance of Iranian handlers, the terror cell was directed to purchase a number of weaponsa, including grenades, and to gather intelligence for their attacks. By World Israel News Staff Israeli authorities recently uncovered an Iranian-backed assassination squad operating out of Jerusalem, prosecutor revealed Tuesday, less than a day after the discovery of another Iran-backed cell in Israel was announced. Seven Arab residents of the eastern Jerusalem neighborhood of Beit Hanina, ages 19 to 23, were arrested last month in connection to the investigation, authorities said Tuesday morning. The terror cell was arrested while plotting several assassinations, including the murder of an Israeli nuclear scientist and the killing of a mayor of a city in central Israel. The central suspect has been identified as Rami Alian, who is said to have recruited the six other suspects for a variety of missions, including torching cars in Jerusalem's Ein Kerem neighborhood, graffiti, and throwing a grenade at the home of an IDF soldier. Operating under the guidance of Iranian handlers, the terror cell was directed to purchase a number of weaponsa, including grenades, and to gather intelligence for their attacks. A day earlier, the Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court on Monday lifted a publication ban, revealing that prosecutors are preparing to indict seven Israeli Jews for espionage on behalf of Iran. The suspects, including an IDF soldier who went AWOL and two minors, are accused of being recruited by Iranian agents and carrying out various espionage missions on their behalf. According to the probe, the suspects gathered intelligence on Israeli military sites, including air force bases at Nevatim and Ramat David, the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, and Iron Dome defense systems. The suspects named are Aziz Nisanov, Alexander Sadikov, Yigal Nissan, Vyacheslav Gushchin, and Yevgeny Yoffe. The identities of the two minors remain classified under a gag order.

Iran-backed assassination squad discovered in Jerusalem	Seven Jerusalem Arabs arrested over plots to assassinate Israeli nuclear scientist and the mayor of an Israeli city, at the behest of Iran.

This airline just suspended flights to Israel until March 2025	Skyrocketing insurance premiums are preventing carriers from resuming passenger and cargo flights to Israel. By World Israel News Staff British Airways announced on Monday that it is suspending all flights to Israel through March 2025, joining a long list of carriers who are no longer flying to the Jewish State. The cancellation 'will give greater certainty to our customers who we’re contacting to advise them of their options, including a full refund,' a British Airways spokesperson told the Times of Israel in an emailed statement. The American carriers Delta and United have also said that they expect to resume flights to Israel only in March 2025. Because American Airlines also suspended flights to Israel, national carrier El AL is the only airline providing direct flights between Israel and the U.S. at the moment. In late September, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) advised European airline to avoid flying to Israel following the assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. While that recommendation was lifted several weeks ago, European carriers have been hesitant to restore their previous Israel routes. KLM, the Lufthansa group and its subsidiaries, Vueling, Air Canada, Ryanair, Cathay Pacific, easyJet, Wizz Air, Air India, LOT, and Emirates are just some of the airlines that are no longer flying to the Jewish State. Only a handful of European airlines, including TUS and Bluebird Airways, are currently facilitating cargo and passenger flights to Israel. Skyrocketing insurance premiums are preventing carriers from resuming passenger and cargo flights to Israel. The lack of flights has seriously impacted the Jewish State's manufacturing industry, with imports and exports seriously delayed. Several industry leaders spoke out against the government, saying the Transport and Finance Ministries must provide financial assistance to businesses impacted by the flight shortage, along with subsidies to encourage airlines to return to Israel. 'Insurers do not agree, or impose premiums that are too high, for the planes to touch Israeli soil,' said Or Berlowitz, the CEO of Israeli airline Arkia, during a recent Knesset hearing on the issue. 'The State of Israel provides a subsidy only for Israeli planes and not for leased planes. In fact, it gives a premium for protection insurance during wartime, and if there was no such thing, no plane would take off from here.'

Hamas murdering Gazans fleeing combat zone: IDF paramedic	IDF paramedic describes Hamas opening fire on civilians in the Strip, wounding unarmed Gazans. By World Israel News Staff Hamas gunmen are shooting unarmed Gazan civilians attempting to flee Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip, as the IDF engages in intensive anti-terror offensive in the area. The IDF has announced that Jabaliya is now a combat zone and that unarmed people should leave the city, but Hamas is actively preventing civilians from fleeing. 'Our battalion went into action to exert as much military pressure as possible on Hamas terrorists, who held the civilian population in the area and forbade them from evacuating to a safe area,' IDF paramedic Corporal Shai Gilboa, told Channel 12 News. According to Gilboa, Hamas opened fire on Gazan civilians trying to reach safety, in an attempt to keep them in the line of fire between the terror group and Israeli military operating in the area. Gazans hurt by Hamas gunfire sought help from the IDF, Gilboa said. 'The wounded came to us and we provided them with first aid in the field, which mostly entailed stopping the bleeding,' she said. She challenged the narrative that Gazans unaffiliated with Hamas are intimidated by IDF troops. 'They smile at us, they wave goodbye to us,' she said. 'They curse Hamas in front of us.' 'Not only are they not afraid of us, a lot of them are on our side,' she added. Hamas has long used Gazan civilians as human shields as central part of its strategy, intentionally holding battles in crowded urban areas in order to maximize civilian casualties. The terror group then leverages the deaths of those caught in the crossfire to falsely accuse Israel of committing human rights violations. Gilboa's account comes after the Biden administration increased pressure on Israel to admit more aid into the Strip. Shortly afterwards, Washington admitted that armed gangs in Gaza - presumably affiliated with Hamas - are preventing the transfer of humanitarian goods throughout the coastal enclave.

Pennsylvania Senate race moves to ‘toss up’ as Dem Bob Casey lose...	Pennsylvania is a key battleground state that could determine both the presidential election and which party controls the Upper Chamber. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Pennsylvania’s Senate race has shifted from 'lean Democrat' to a 'toss up' as incumbent Sen. Bob Casey (D.) loses ground to his Republican challenger Dave McCormick just two weeks before Election Day, according to the Cook Political Report. Cook stated that the race is now competitive enough to be considered a 'toss up,' adding that 'both Republican and Democratic internal polls show this is now a margin-of-error race, with Casey holding a slim, statistically insignificant lead of between one and two points.' As his reelection prospects slip, Casey is aiming to appeal to Donald Trump voters, highlighting in an ad released last week his 'siding with' the former president on a trade and tariffs bill in 2017. Polling released Monday by Atlas Intel shows McCormick with a slight lead over Casey for the first time in the Senate race. Around 48.3 percent of respondents said they would vote for McCormick, while 47.1 percent supported Casey. In September, Casey led McCormick 47 percent to 45 percent, according to Atlas Intel. Pennsylvania is a key battleground state that could determine both the presidential election and which party controls the Upper Chamber. Presidential nominees Trump and Kamala Harris remain effectively tied in the Keystone State, the New York Times reported Monday. Republicans are looking to regain control of the Senate, where Democrats hold a narrow 51-49 majority. The seat vacated by retiring West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (I.) is widely expected to flip red, while Montana GOP candidate Tim Sheehy is polling ahead of incumbent Sen. Jon Tester (D.).

Suicide a ‘delayed trauma response,’ experts warn after Oct. 7 su...	An increase in suicide can be a delayed response to the powerful national trauma that the war brings,' said Dr. Shiri Daniels. By Anna Epshtein, TPS Although the first months after the October 7 attacks saw fewer suicide-related calls to Israel’s national emergency line, the number of suicide cases may increase as the war continues, Israeli researchers warned on Monday. The announcement came one day after October 7 survivor Shirel Golan killed herself on her 22nd birthday. Golan was at the Nova Music Festival, an all-night rave attended by 3,500 people at Kibbutz Re’im. The festival became a killing field where 364 people were massacred and 40 others were taken hostage. Of all the locations attacked by Hamas on October 7, the highest death toll was at the music festival. 'An increase in suicide can be a delayed response to the powerful national trauma that the war brings,' said Dr. Shiri Daniels, the National Professional Director of the Israeli ERAN Association for emotional first aid. Daniels was part of a team of researchers from the University of Haifa, Tel Aviv University, Columbia University, and the Israeli College of Management who analyzed all the calls to ERAN’s hotline in the three months after the October 7 attack. Their findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, JAMA Psychiatry. ‘We Expect An increase In Suicide Risk Rates’ The researchers found there was a decline of suicide-related calls following the attack as compared to months before the attack – from 1,887 calls in the three months before the war to 1,663 calls total in the three months after, in contrast to sharp increase in the overall number of calls. But then the numbers of suicide-related calls began to grow, too. 'One possible reason for the decrease in suicide-related calls in the immediate period after October 7th is the increased social cohesion that sometimes occurs in the initial stage of a national crisis,' said Dr. Joy Benatov from the Special Education Department at the University of Haifa, who led the research. 'But the effect of this cohesion dissipates with the prolongation of crises,’ Dr. Benatov adds. ‘In light of the continuation of the war and national crisis, we expect an increase in suicide risk rates, as we saw in studies conducted after the September 11 terrorist attack in New York,' she added. ‘She Looked Unfocused’ Golan was rescued from the Nova massacre by a police officer from the Bedouin village of Rahat Remo Salman el-Hozayel, one of the heroes of a documentary film, 'In the Same Boat,' which tells stories of Israeli-Arab citizens who saved lives on October 7. 'She looked unfocused, was jumping from theme to theme,' Roman Kovgan, line producer of the documentary who interviewed Golan in March, recalled to The Press Service of Israel. 'It was evident she was not in a good psychological state.' Kovgan also recalled meeting Golan again one day before the documentary’s October 7 premiere in Tel Aviv. 'She looked even more depressed and said it would be too hard for her to see the movie, she was gathering all her strength to get through the anniversary,' Kovgan said. Golan’s family said Shirel developed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder but never received adequate state assistance for the necessary treatment. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

‘I only did it for the money’ – Iranian spy in Israel	Israeli man who admitted to spying for Iran claims he was motivated only by money, not ideology. By World Israel News Staff An Azeri-Israeli man who spied on behalf of Iran during the ongoing war told investigators that he was motivated solely by the financial rewards he received, and said he is not hostile towards the State of Israel. According to a report from Hebrew language outlet Mako, one of the key players in the newly uncovered 7 member Iranian spy ring claimed he was 'blind' to the national security ramifications of his actions. Aziz Nisanov, who immigrated to Israel from Azerbaijan, admitted that he had carried out numerous activities on behalf of Iran, such as taking pictures of sensitive military bases and other sites that could be potentially targeted by Tehran. 'I know that I made a stupid mistake and that I will pay for it by sitting in prison,' Nisanov told investigators, according to the Mako report. 'I did not realize that I was harming the security of the state. I was blind and did what was asked of me. I was only interested in the money, I did not think about anything else.' News of the arrest of another Azeri immigrant charged with spying for Iran, Haifa resident Vyacheslav Guschin, surprised his acquaintances. A friend of Guschin, who was only identified by his first initial G, described him as an unemployed alcoholic who would engage in street brawls with others in the neighborhood. Gushin worked sporadically in odd jobs, such as washing cars or delivering food, G told Mako. 'He used to spend most of the money he earned on alcohol and cigarettes,' G said. 'He lived alone. He often got into fights with people when he was drunk. I thought he could be many things, but a spy? I wouldn't have dreamed of it.' According to G, Guschin abruptly disappeared from public life around six weeks ago. Patrons of a local liquor store Guschin frequented had noticed he was not seen for a while. 'We thought that he went abroad to visit his family or that he moved to another neighborhood,' G said. 'Everyone is here in complete shock that he was revealed to be a spy.'

Though designated a terror group, Hamas funding thrives in Europe	One way the groups stay ahead of authorities is by shifting operations to newer organizations. By David Isaac, JNS The Hamas terror organization has managed to increase its fundraising efforts in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom since its terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, according to four reports that the European Leadership Network released this month. The reports from ELNET, which convenes leaders to foster close relations between Europe and Israel, focus on the activities of Hamas-affiliated fundraising groups in the five countries. 'In all four reports, we have seen increasing levels of operations since Oct. 7,' Daniel Shadmy, an ELNET spokesman, told JNS. The reports identify some 30 organizations, which operate under 'civil fronts,' including nonprofits and lobbying groups, and people affiliated with Hamas who work in Europe. Hamas’s funding operations are more deeply rooted in the United Kingdom and Germany than in the other countries upon which the report focuses. That makes them 'harder to dismantle' in the two countries, according to Shadmy. Hamas-affiliated groups operate relatively unscathed in Europe, despite European governments and the European Union designating Hamas a terror organization. One way the groups stay ahead of authorities is by shifting operations to newer organizations, per the ELNET reports. 'One of the key findings of the report is that the Hamas-affiliated network has shut down three older, pan-European organizations, possibly in response to formal designations, and moved their operations to three newer organizations,' Shadmy told JNS. 'The ‘replacement organizations’ were established and are led in whole or in part by the same six individuals who led the initially dissolved groups,' per the reports, which name the six as Adel Abdallah Doghman, Mohammad Hannoun, Majed Al-Zeer, Amin Abou Rashed, Zaher Birawi and Mazen Kahel. The organizations that make up the 'new' circle include the Palestinians in Europe Conference, the European Palestinian Council for Political Relations and the European Palestinians Initiative for National Action. There is the European failure to enforce penalties on those associated with the terror group, per the reports. 'There is a gap between the sanctions or designations in place and the willingness or operational capability of European governments or the E.U. institutions to enforce them, which leads to this situation,' Shadmy told JNS. Many of the organizations that ELNET identified are not officially registered, 'raising concerns about their transparency, activities and true objectives in Europe,' per the reports. Some of those activities include lobbying E.U. officials, delivering material support to the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, influencing the public via media relations and 'legitimizing Hamas-affiliated actors to European policymakers without disclosing their Hamas ties,' the reports state. ELNET calls on European governments to investigate and shut down the Hamas-affiliated organizations and asks banks and financial institutions to monitor the Hamas-affiliated individuals mentioned in the reports and review their financial activity. ELNET also hopes that its reports will be a resource for research institutions and think tanks to expose publicly Hamas’s European fundraising.

IDF discovers Nasrallah’s half a billion dollar money bunker bene...	The IDF also reported it carried out airstrikes against Hezbollah's banks and financial institutions. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari announced that Israel's military has uncovered a money bunker worth half a billion dollars belonging to Hezbollah's deceased leader Hassan Nasrallah underneath a hospital in Lebanon. The store of money was discovered underneath the Al-Sahel Hospital in Dahieh, Beirut, and was used as Nasrallah's hiding place during emergencies. Hagari said that Israel's military will not strike the hospital. However, hospital director Fadi Alameh has denied the facility has any connection to Hezbollah and has urged the Lebanese army to guard the site. According to a N12 report, the money is used by Hezbollah to fund its activities and much of it has been diverted from funds intended for the Lebanese public. 'This bunker is deliberately placed under the hospital and on both sides of it,' Hagari said. 'You can see the buildings under which the entrance shafts to the bunker are located.' 'This money could and still can go to rebuilding the state of Lebanon. This money had been intended to go exclusively to arming the terrorist organization Hezbollah and had no other destination,' he added. Hagari said the IAF will continue to monitor the compound. He continued, 'We call on the citizens of Lebanon, the Lebanese government, and international institutions - do not allow Hezbollah to keep terrorist funds under a hospital. Even in the coming hours, we will continue to attack Hezbollah targets throughout Lebanon, including in Beirut in Dahieh.' The IDF also reported it carried out airstrikes against Hezbollah's banks and financial institutions used to launder money and fund terror attacks. The Al-Qard al-Hassan Association (AQAH), often referred to as Hezbollah's 'bank,' is technically a charitable association. Israel apparently struck 20 of AQAH's 34 branches in crucial Hezbollah strongholds, including Beirut, Tyre, Sidon, and Baalbek, on Sunday night. In comments to The Press Service of Israel, one senior figure in the Israeli intelligence community described AQAH as 'one of the largest centers of economic power for the Iranian proxy.'

Sinwar used 6 hostages as human shields before they were murdered	When the IDF recovered the bodies of the six hostages, they also discovered DNA evidence that Sinwar had been in the area. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News According to reports and DNA evidence, the six hostages who were executed in late August were used as human shields by Hamas leader and October 7th mastermind Yahya Sinwar, who was killed last week. Sinwar was eliminated by chance during an IDF operation in Rafah, not far away from where the six hostages were killed by their captors. The names of the six slain hostages are Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Carmel Gat, and Almog Sarusi. When the IDF recovered the bodies of the hostages on August 31, they also discovered DNA from Sinwar indicating he had been in the area at some point between August 21 and August 27. Reports from early in the war that Sinwar was hiding in Gaza tunnels and using hostages as human shields, and the DNA, location, and reports connect the six slain hostages to Sinwar. The IDF had opportunities to assassinate Sinwar earlier in the war, but his use of hostages as human shields proved an obstacle to these operations. The reason Sinwar was discovered last week unaccompanied by hostages was due to the fact that the six had been killed, and their severely weakened conditions were likely a factor in their not being forced to travel with him. The hostages subsisted for months on only energy bars until they were too weak to move alongside Sinwar and were executed. The terrorist captors moved many of the hostages to Rafah following the liberation of 105 of them in November because the IDF had not yet operated in the area close to the Egyptian border. The six hostages were confined to a tunnel three stories or 20 meters below ground, with their captors living above. On August 21, the IDF, acting on intelligence Sinwar was in the area, battled with 26 terrorists, killing and wounding most of them, among them those who had been guarding the hostages. When the dead captors were replaced, the new captors suspected the IDF was attacking them again and decided to execute the six hostages.

Hezbollah only has 30% of it firepower left, IDF reports	2,000 Hezbollah terrorists have been eliminated since the war began, 1,200 of them since the initial ground operation in Lebanon. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's Northern Command reports that Hezbollah only has 30% of its rockets and launchers remaining and has lost 2,000 of its terrorists since October 8th last year. The Northern Command added that just a few more weeks of operations in Lebanon are required to accomplish goals that will allow northern Israeli residents to return home in safety. According to IDF data, 2,000 Hezbollah terrorists have been eliminated since the war began, 1,200 of them since the initial ground operation in Lebanon. Of the terrorists the IDF eliminated, seven were Hezbollah brigade commanders, 21 were battalion commanders, and 24 were company commanders. The IDF attacked 3,200 Hezbollah targets, which include weapons depots, launchers, anti-tank positions, and command centers, 300 of them in the last 24 hours. Overnight on Sunday, the IDF targeted dozens of sites and facilities in Lebanon that Hezbollah used to fund terror attacks against Israelis. 'These funds, which Hezbollah used for terror activities, were stored by the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, which directly funds Hezbollah's terror activities, including the purchase of weapons and payments to operatives in Hezbollah's military wing,' the IDF said. 'The Hezbollah terrorist organization stores billions of dollars in the association's branches, including money that was directly held under the name of the terrorist organization,' the statement continued. 'We will strike a large number of targets in the coming hours, and additional targets later tonight,' IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said on Sunday, emphasizing that in the coming days, the IDF would reveal how Iran funds Hezbollah's terror activities via civilian institutions, associations and organizations. Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, head of the Arab Media Branch in the IDF Spokesperson's Unit, said, 'The Iranian state budget funds a large portion of Hezbollah's terrorist activities. Hezbollah uses these funds to finance its terrorist activities, including acquiring weapons, purchasing facilities for storing combat equipment, establishing launch sites and paying its members, as well as carrying out various terrorist activities.'

Report: Hamas SIM card alert ignored hours before Oct. 7 massacre	Marked 'Top Secret,' the warning was sent to several key security bodies, including the Israel Police, the National Security Council, and the Mossad. By Jewish Breaking News A shocking new report has exposed a critical intelligence oversight in the hours leading up to Hamas’ devastating October 7 attack on southern Israel. According to Channel 12, the Shin Bet had distributed SIM cards among Hamas ranks as part of a covert operation to serve as an early warning system. At 2:58 a.m. on October 7, roughly three hours before the attack, an automated alert was triggered when a significant number of these cards were simultaneously activated across multiple Hamas battalions. Marked 'Top Secret,' the warning was sent to several key security bodies, including the Israel Police, the National Security Council, and the Mossad. However, despite its worrying nature, the alert failed to prompt any significant response. The Hamas massacre near the Gaza border proceeded as planned, where terrorists would later slaughter 1,200 innocent civilians and take 250 hostages. Police insiders claim that such a critical alert warranted direct phone calls, not just a written report. Compounding the oversight, intelligence had noted Hamas leaders retreating to underground bunkers days before. As investigations into the events leading up to October 7 continue, the IDF has promised transparency. IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari referred to the reports during a press briefing on Sunday night. 'We have not yet finished the investigations into warnings on the night of October 7,' he said. 'At the moment, we are focusing on fighting and dealing with investigations.' However, for a public demanding answers, such assurances provide little comfort.

‘UNIFIL cannot be part of the solution’ after report Hezbollah br...	In an Oct. 13 video message, Israeli Prime Minister directly called on UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to withdraw the contingent of 10,500 UNIFIL soldiers from 50 countries for their own safety. By Pesach Benson, TPS Following a report that Hezbollah bribed UNIFIL peacekeepers to use their positions in southern Lebanon and took control of their security cameras along the border, an analyst said the monitors 'cannot be part of the solution.' According to a Monday report in the Israel Hayom daily, captured Hezbollah terrorists taken to Israel for questioning told interrogators that the Iran-backed terror group paid peacekeepers to use UNIFIL positions in southern Lebanon. The report added that the terrorists also admitted that Hezbollah took control of the force’s security cameras. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which is tasked with monitoring the cessation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon, did not respond to The Press Service of Israel’s requests for comment. 'It’s crucial that UNIFIL does a very serious internal review of what’s really going on there,' Sarit Zahavi, president and founder of the Alma Research Center, told TPS-IL. 'UNIFIL itself cannot be part of the solution now. This time, there must be an effective enforcement mechanism that won’t allow Hezbollah to recover from the damage the IDF inflicted on them,' she added, explaining that 'we don’t find ourselves back in the same situation within a year.' Said Zahavi, 'For years, we’ve been raising the need to significantly reduce UNIFIL’s force. You don’t need ten thousand soldiers to provide humanitarian assistance. And you don’t need ten thousand soldiers getting in our way to do the job they didn’t do.' Israeli officials have called on UNIFIL to evacuate southern Lebanon. In an Oct. 13 video message, Israeli Prime Minister directly called on UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to withdraw the contingent of 10,500 soldiers from 50 countries for their own safety, saying the monitors are 'providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists.' Guterres and Western diplomats rejected Netanyahu’s call. The UN Security Council unanimously renewed UNIFIL’s mandate in August. UNIFIL was established in 1978 to confirm Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon. The 'Blue Line' demarcating the 120 km-long Israel-Lebanone border was created in 2000 by UN cartographers to verify Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon, which the UN Security Council later certified as complete. The border runs from Rosh HaNikra on the Mediterranean coast to Mount Dov, where it converges with Syria. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Israeli officials have been critical of the peacekeepers for failing to stop Hezbollah, which has fired thousands of rockets at Israel since October 7. 'By and large, every third house in the Shi’ite villages of south Lebanon is used in some way by Hezbollah for military purposes, be it weapons storage, the entrance of a tunnel, or a launchpad for shooting rockets at Israel,' Zahavi told TPS-IL in August.

US says THAAD anti-missile system ‘in place’ in Israel	President Joe Biden said the THAAD’s deployment, along with about 100 US soldiers, was meant to help defend Israel. By The Algemeiner and Reuters The US military has rushed its advanced anti-missile system to Israel and it is now 'in place,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. THAAD, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, is a critical part of the US military’s layered air defense systems and adds to Israel‘s already formidable anti-missile defenses. 'The THAAD system is in place,' Austin said, speaking to reporters before his arrival in Ukraine on Monday. He declined to say whether it was operational, but added: 'We have the ability to put it into operation very quickly and we’re on pace with our expectations.' President Joe Biden said the THAAD’s deployment, along with about 100 US soldiers, was meant to help defend Israel, which is weighing an expected retaliation against Iran after Tehran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel on Oct 1. The United States has been urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear sites and his concerns about a strike on its energy infrastructure. Responding to questions from reporters, Biden said last week he had a good understanding of when and how Israel would attack Iran. But he also said he saw an opportunity to end the two enemies’ back-and-forth strikes. Austin was cautious. 'It’s hard to say exactly what that [Israel‘s] strike will look like,' Austin told reporters. 'At the end of the day, that’s an Israeli decision, and whether or not the Israelis believe it’s proportional and how the Iranians perceive it, I mean those may be two different things.' 'We’re going to do — continue to do — everything we can … to dial down the tensions and hopefully get both parties to begin to de-escalate. So, we’ll see what happens,' he added.

Israeli Japanese study offers new hope for pancreatic cancer pati...	Laboratory tests have yielded promising results, with D’20 effectively inhibiting the movement of pancreatic cancer cells while allowing normal cell growth to continue unimpeded. By Jewish Breaking News A groundbreaking study between Israeli and Japanese scientists may herald a new era in the fight against pancreatic cancer. Researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Weizmann Institute of Science, and the University of Tokyo have been tackling Matrix Metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7), an enzyme crucial to cancer’s ability to invade surrounding tissues. Previous attempts to target MMP7 have been hampered by its structural similarities to other essential enzymes, making it challenging to develop a drug that wouldn’t disrupt vital bodily functions. Undeterred, the researchers employed an advanced peptide discovery technology called Mirror-Image Random Nonstandard Peptide Integrated Discovery (MI-RaPID) to identify D’20. Laboratory tests have yielded promising results, with D’20 effectively inhibiting the movement of pancreatic cancer cells while allowing normal cell growth to continue unimpeded. What sets D’20 apart is its unique structure. Composed of twelve specially modified D-amino acids, it demonstrates remarkable stability in conditions mimicking the human body, including exposure to blood and digestive enzymes. The team’s findings, recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Angewandte Chemie, have sparked excitement in the oncology community. While human trials are still on the horizon, the success of D’20 in laboratory settings offers hope for more effective pancreatic cancer treatments in the future.

Israel strikes at heart of Hezbollah’s terror financing system	Most of the bank’s funding comes from Iran, totaling some $700 million per year, as well as from illegal sources such as cocaine trafficking. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli airstrikes targeted Hezbollah financial sites across Lebanon overnight Sunday, including in Beirut. According to the Israel Defense Forces, dozens of facilities and sites used by the Iranian proxy to fund its terrorist activities against the Jewish state were attacked. 'These funds, which Hezbollah used for terror activities, were stored by the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, which directly funds Hezbollah’s terror activities, including the purchase of weapons and payments to operatives in Hezbollah’s military wing,' the IDF said.

'We will strike a large number of targets in the coming hours, and additional targets later tonight,' IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said on Sunday, emphasizing that in the coming days, the IDF would reveal how Iran funds Hezbollah’s terror activities via civilian institutions, associations and organizations. The military emphasized that many measures were taken before the strikes to minimize harm to the civilian population, including issuing advanced warnings via various platforms. Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, head of the Arab Media Branch in the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit, posted a video message in Arabic to X urging residents of Lebanon to move away from infrastructure associated with the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association shortly before the wave of attacks began. 'A large portion of Hezbollah’s terrorist activities is funded by the Iranian state budget. Hezbollah uses these funds to finance its terrorist activities, including acquiring weapons, purchasing facilities for storing combat equipment, establishing launch sites and paying its members, as well as carrying out various terrorist activities,' Adraee explained. #عاجل سكان لبنان، جيش الدفاع سوف يبدأ مهاجمة بنى تحتية تابعة لجمعية القرض الحسن التابعة لحزب الله - ابتعدوا عنها فورًا يتم تمويل قسم كبير من انشطة منظمة حزب الله الإرهابية من ميزانية الدولة الإيرانية، حيث يستخدم حزب الله هذه الأموال بغية تمويل أنشطته الإرهابية وبضمن ذلك… pic.twitter.com/E6SkEikfHG &mdash; افيخاي ادرعي (@AvichayAdraee) October 20, 2024 He issued evacuation notices for at least 25 buildings in the Beirut area, in the Bekaa Valley and in South Lebanon.

'The IDF continues to work forcefully to destroy Hezbollah’s terrorist infrastructure. Therefore, we urge people inside buildings used by Hezbollah to move at least 500 meters away in the coming hours.' Many explosions were reported in the Dahiya neighborhood south of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. Israeli attacks were also carried out near the Beirut airport. Buildings were seen collapsing and others were on fire. מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר תקפו במהלך הלילה, בביירות, בעומק ובדרום לבנון, ובהכוונה מודיעינית של אגף המודיעין, עשרות מפקדות ואתרים בהם אוחסנו כספים ששימשו את הזרוע הצבאית של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה לפעילות טרור נגד מדינת ישראל>> pic.twitter.com/QKxITJxzkc &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) October 21, 2024 According to Lebanese media reports, there were three casualties from a drone strike on a residential building in Baalbek, and additional strikes were reported in the Beqaa Valley region. 'These strikes are part of the IDF’s ongoing efforts to degrade Hezbollah’s terror infrastructure, its military capabilities and ability to rebuild,' the IDF said. According to Channel 12, Hezbollah’s economic institution, Al-Qard, operates about 30 branches in areas of Lebanon where Shi’ite Muslims are concentrated, with about half of the branches being in Beirut. Most of the bank’s funding comes from Iran, totaling some $700 million per year, as well as from illegal sources such as cocaine trafficking, according to the report. 'The Shiite terror organization is under heavy sanctions, and Qard Al-Hassan allows it to operate without significant restrictions,' Channel 12 reported. 'According to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), the volume of loans given by Qard Al-Hassan grew from approximately $76.5 million in 2007, the year after the Second Lebanon War, to around $480 million in 2019. The total activity of Qard Al-Hassan from the opening of the network in 1983 until 2019 is estimated at about $3.5 billion,' the report continued. This growth occurred despite American sanctions imposed as early as 2007. 'The reason for this is that the employees of Qard Al-Hassan use private accounts in recognized banks in Lebanon, with the aim of circumventing the sanctions,' according to Channel 12. IDF ground operations in Southern Lebanon continue The IDF said on Monday morning that over the past 24 hours, troops in Southern Lebanon had located and dismantled large amounts of Hezbollah weaponry, including anti-tank missiles, launchers aimed at Israeli communities, RPG launchers, munitions, explosives, grenades and additional combat equipment. תמונות מפעילות כוחות צה'ל בדרום לבנון: pic.twitter.com/KUWacMcHgV &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) October 21, 2024 Soldiers also killed Hezbollah terrorists, including tactical-level commanders and a terrorist cell that had launched anti-tank missiles at soldiers.

The minister held an operational assessment with the division commander and other senior officers, and also spoke with combat troops. 'Our goal is to completely ‘clean’ the area [of Hezbollah infrastructure] so that Israel’s northern communities may return to their homes and rebuild their lives. I believe that this is very significant—the IDF is conducting operations and we still have missions to complete,' Gallant said. 'We have Hezbollah prisoners who are sharing information.

Sinwar refused Egyptian offer to flee Gaza, Israel held back on k...	Egypt reportedly offered to help Sinwar escape the Gaza Strip in exchange for letting Cairo negotiate a hostage deal with Israel – but was refused. By World Israel News Staff Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar was offered an opportunity by Egypt to escape the Gaza Strip, according to a new report, but declined the offer, insisting he remain in the coastal enclave amid the war with Israel. On Sunday night, The Wall Street Journal reported that early on in the war after October 7th, Arab negotiators working to broker a deal between Hamas and Israel proposed that Sinwar be allowed to escape, in exchange for Cairo being empowered to negotiate on behalf of Hamas with Israel to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire. Sinwar declined the offer, however, in part, according to the report, because of his hope that Hezbollah and Iran might be brought into a full-scale war with Israel. 'I’m not under siege, I’m on Palestinian soil,' Sinwar was quoted as telling Arab negotiators early in the war when he turned down their offer of allowing him to escape abroad. The Hamas leader reportedly counted on intense pressure from abroad on Israel over collateral damage during the war to induce Jerusalem to agree to the terror group’s terms in talks, effectively imposing a deal on Israel which was favorable to Hamas. The report added that Sinwar remained adamant throughout that Hamas would make no concessions in negotiations with Israel, even after he predicted that the murder of six Israeli hostages in September would provoke fierce criticism of the terror group and renewed efforts to compel Hamas to soften its position. In addition, the report claimed that prior to October 7th, Israel had mulled assassination Sinwar, citing people involved in the plans. However, the operations were inevitably nixed over disagreements among Israeli officials, a source said.

Iranian spy cell in Israel uncovered	Seven Israeli Jews arrested for allegedly spying on Israel's Iron Dome missile defense network and other key targets on behalf of Tehran. By World Israel News Staff Seven Israeli Jews from northern Israel were arrested recently on suspicion of spying on behalf of Iran, Israeli prosecutors revealed Monday. The Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court on Monday lifted a publication ban, revealing that Israel’s State Prosecutor has filed a statement of intent to indict seven Israeli citizens from Haifa and other towns in northern Israel. The suspects, including an IDF soldier who went AWOL and two minors, are accused of being recruited by Iranian agents and carrying out various espionage missions on their behalf. According to the investigation, the suspects allegedly gathered intelligence on sensitive military sites, including Israel air force bases at Nevatim and Ramat David, the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, and Iron Dome defense systems. Additionally, they received maps of strategic locations, such as the Golani Brigade training base. The suspects named are Aziz Nisanov, Alexander Sadikov, Yigal Nissan, Vyacheslav Gushchin, and Yevgeny Yoffe. The identities of the two minors remain classified under a gag order. The State Prosecutor plans to submit formal charges on Friday to the Haifa District Court, alleging serious security offenses. Prosecutors describe the case as one of the most severe espionage incidents investigated in recent years. The investigation has been overseen by the head of the Haifa District Security Prosecution team, Shelly Brazili-Zaavi, along with Attorney Einav Itzco-Gold, and Deputy State Attorney Alon Altman, specializing in national security matters. Authorities say the suspects operated under the direction of two Iranian handlers with whom they maintained direct contact. Over the past two years, the spy cell is alleged to have carried out numerous missions for these agents, including the collection of photographs and information related to Israeli military installations. Payment for their activities reportedly amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars, transferred partly through cryptocurrency. Investigators emphasized that the espionage activities continued even during Israel’s ongoing conflict on multiple fronts, further underscoring the severity of the threat. The prosecution is expected to request that the suspects remain in custody until the end of legal proceedings.

Why is terror-supporting imam leading anti-IDF protests in Israel...	Sheikh Raed Salah is leading protests that slander Israeli soldiers and promote false genocide claims. By World Israel News Staff A radical imam who served time in prison for terror-related offenses is leading protests in Israel against the IDF, which include signs falsely alleging that Israeli soldiers are committing genocide in Gaza, a watchdog group warns. Images circulating on Arabic-language social media channels on Sunday evening showed Sheikh Ra'ed Salah at the forefront of demonstrations accusing the IDF of crimes against humanity in the Strip. Salah, an Islamic preacher and the leader of the outlawed Northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel, stood next to a man holding a sign which called on Israeli troops to 'stop murdering women and children.' The imam has a long history of supporting terror and incitement against the Jewish State and its security forces. In 2003, he was convicted of fundraising for Hamas and served six months in prison. Salah served additional stints in prison for giving sermons that glorified violence against Jews and Israelis, as well as for assaulting a police officer in Jerusalem. 'Sheikh Ra'ed Salah was convicted of supporting terror. He lead a movement that was banned from operating in Israel during the Second Intifada due to its terror ties,' Maor Tzemach, Chariman of NGO Your Jersualem, told World Israel News. 'But now, he's the leader of protests against 'genocide.' He's front and center at these demonstrations that accuse Israel of serious human rights violations,' Tzemach continued. 'The sheikh's presence makes it clear that these aren't legitimate protests that are part of the discourse in a democratic society,' he added. Rather, Salah's participation proves that the demonstrations have a radical Islamic agenda, Tzemach said. 'There can't be a reality in which a convicted terror supporter is protesting against Israeli soldiers in such an inciteful matter, falsely accusing the IDF of genocide and stirring up hatred during an ongoing war,' Tzemach said. Tzemach called on the authorities to take steps to end the protests, which he described as 'hotbeds of incitement, that directly lead to the creation of new terrorists.' He also said it was critical for the security agencies to 'put a stop to Sheikh Ra'ed Salah's activities, including by charging him criminally for supporting terror.'

Israel will resettle the Gaza Strip, declares minister	Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip just a matter of time, vows senior Israeli government minister - but adds such a project is not part of the current war. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior Israeli government minister on Monday called for the resettlement of the Gaza Strip, saying the restoration of the coastal enclave's Jewish presence was both a necessity for Israeli security and an inevitability. In an opinion piece published by Arutz Sheva, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) compared the security situation on three different fronts, noting that the areas where Israel maintained a civilian presence, and not merely a military one, had greater long-term stability. 'Without settlement, there is no security,' Smotrich wrote. 'That is one of the clear lessons from October 7th and the Iron Swords War which we have been waging for the past year in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon.' 'Reality has taught us that wherever we withdraw from is turned into a terrorist hotspot for Iran's proxies, and is used by terrorist elements to attack us.' While Israel had maintained security control through direct military intervention in both southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip for decades, both areas were later withdrawn from, leaving them to become centers of terrorist activity against Israel. The IDF pulled out of southern Lebanon in May 2000, ending an 18-year presence. Five years later, the Sharon government evacuated the roughly 9,000 Israelis living in the Gaza Strip, and withdrew IDF forces during the Gaza Disengagement. But, Smotrich continued, 'In Judea and Samaria there is settlement, so despite the fact that we do have to fight terrorism there and always be 'trimming the grass,' the terrorism there can never reach the levels it has gotten to in Lebanon and Gaza.' 'Thanks to the settlements, Kfar Saba did not become [like] Kfar Azza,' Smotrich claimed. 'To be honest, it is fairly obvious to me that at the end of the day, there will be Jewish settlement of the Gaza Strip.' The finance minister also claimed that a majority of Israelis support resettling Gaza. 'I am convinced, and this is borne out in almost every poll, that there is today a majority of Jews who back resettling Gush Katif,' Smotrich wrote, referring to the largest bloc of Jewish towns in the Gaza Strip prior to 2005. Nevertheless, Smotrich emphasized that any moves towards resettlement will only begin after the current war is completed. 'It is important to emphasize that this is not one of the goals of the war, as they were defined by the government. Those war goals were defined for a wide consensus - destroying Hamas both as a military force and a civil entity, bringing the hostages back, establishing IDF security control for a period of years in order to prevent the rebuilding of the terror organizations and to remove the threat of being attacked from Gaza.'

‘That’s my house’: Gaza man discovers Sinwar was killed hiding in...	Gaza man discovers Yahya Sinwar was eliminated during a firefight in his home in Rafah, making the discovery only after watching footage of the Hamas leader's last moments. By World Israel News Staff A Gazan man made a grisly discovery regarding his house over the weekend, after watching footage circulating on the internet of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar's final moments, and the removal of his body after his death. Ashraf Abo Taha spoke with the BBC in a report published Saturday in which he recalled learning via social media that Sinwar had been killed in his home in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Sinwar - chairman of the Hamas politburo, architect of the October 7th attacks and chief of Hamas forces in Gaza - was shot and killed during a gun battle with Israeli troops in an abandoned building on Ibn Sena Street in Rafah on Wednesday, after IDF troops spotted terrorists outside of the building. The IDF troops were unaware that Sinwar was amongst the terrorists who had been hiding in the building, and engaged Sinwar and his bodyguards after spotting the armed men with a surveillance drone. After his death, footage was circulated on social media outlets of Sinwar during and immediately after the gun battle, along with photographs and footage taken during the removal of his body from the building. When Abo Taha's daughter showed him footage from Sinwar's final moments, he identified the building in question as his own home of 15 years, which he abandoned this May as Israel advised civilians to evacuate the city. 'I was like 'yes this is my house' and I saw the pictures and here I was shocked,' Abo Taha told the BBC. Abo Taha emphasized that neither he nor his family had offered the Hamas chief use of their home. 'Never ever did me and my brothers and sons have anything to do with this.' Lamenting the damage to his home and property, Abo Taha said 'Only God can compensate us.' 'What happened has saddened me a lot, the house that I built and all my payments are gone.'

‘Dangerous precedent’ – Ex-Israeli ambassador blasts Kamala Harri...	Former Israeli lawmaker and ambassador to the US Michael Oren takes aim at Vice President Kamala Harris after she appeared to justify heckler's accusations of Israeli genocide in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff A former Israeli lawmaker and ambassador to the United States excoriated Vice President Kamala Harris Sunday and demanded the Biden administration to speak out, after Harris appeared to justify an anti-Israel activist’s allegations of genocide in the Gaza Strip. Last Thursday, Vice President Harris and billionaire businessman and television personality Mark Cuban visited the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee for a campaign event, during which Harris addressed a gathering of students. A heckler wearing a keffiyeh interrupted Harris repeatedly during the event, accusing the Biden administration of enabling Israeli 'genocide' of Gazans. In response, Harris neither affirmed nor denied his claims, but did appear to justify his accusations, saying that she knows 'what you’re speaking of,' while emphasizing the administration’s efforts to secure an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. 'I know what you’re speaking of,' said Harris. 'I want a cease-fire. I want the hostage deal done. I want the war to end.' The heckler interrupted Harris’ response, saying: 'But what about the genocide? What about the genocide though?' Harris responded by saying: 'I respect your right to speak, but I’m speaking right now.' 'How about the billions of dollars to Israel?' the protester shouted. 'What about the 19,000 children dead, and you won’t call it a genocide?' 'Listen, what he’s talking about, it’s real,' said Harris in response. On Sunday afternoon, former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren, who also served as a Knesset Member and Deputy Minister, slammed Harris’ response and called on the White House to reject all claims of genocide in Gaza. 'A very dangerous precedent,' Oren tweeted. 'I was disturbed to view the video in which Vice President Kamala Harris appears to confirm the charge that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. This is the first time that the White House has been linked to a libel which threatens Israel’s legitimacy and security. I call on the U.S. administration to issue an immediate and complete denial.'

Trump: ‘You can’t blame Israel for hitting back hard’	Former President Donald Trump defends Israel's response to October 7th invasion, blames Biden administration's Iran policy for the attacks. By World Israel News Staff Former President Donald Trump defended Israel’s military response to the Hamas invasion of October 7th, while reiterating his claim that the attacks would not have occurred had he been in office in 2023. Speaking with the Dubai-based Al Arabiya outlet on Sunday, Trump lamented casualties and collateral damage in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, while blaming the October 7th invasion of Israel on the Biden administration’s policies vis-à-vis Iran, which the former president claimed encouraged Iran and its proxies to attack Israel. 'If I were president, that war would have never started,' Trump said. 'You wouldn’t have all those dead people, all those demolished cities and areas. You wouldn’t have had October 7th, that’s the most important.' Trump cited sanctions waivers provided by the Biden administration to Iran. 'If October 7th wouldn’t happen, which it wouldn’t have, because Iran funds it, and Iran had no money. They had no money. They had absolutely no money. And I would have made a deal with them, and they wouldn’t have done October 7th. But because they have no respect for Biden, they did it.' 'They had no money, and Biden allowed them to have $300 billion.' Israel, Trump continued, was justified in its response to the October 7th atrocities, saying the Jewish state 'hit back hard.' 'You can’t blame Israel for hitting back and they hit back hard. Much harder than anybody would have thought.' Touting his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said he would, if elected, be able to bring peace to the region and expand the Abraham Accords. 'I want to see it all stop, I want to see the Middle East get back to peace – a real peace, a peace that is going to be a lasting peace,' Trump said. 'It’s gonna happen and it’s gonna happen soon.' '[Netanyahu] does listen to me,' Trump continued, noting his upcoming telephone conversation with the Israeli leader scheduled for Monday. Trump warned Israel not to adhere to Biden’s calls to refrain from making a substantial retaliatory attack on Iran in response to its massive October 1st ballistic missile attack. 'He is going to do what he wants to do and I think [Netanyahu] has to do that.' 'Biden has been historically horrible in foreign policy, incompetent.' 'Whatever he says, do the opposite, and you’ll be brilliant. But [Biden] gave [Netanyahu] instructions not to do anything, and Israel is under great danger – they’re under much less danger than they were a month ago.'

These are Israel’s demands for a ceasefire with Hezbollah	Israel demands freedom to continue fighting Hezbollah along the border, access to Lebanese airspace. By World Israel News Staff Israel provided the U.S. last week with a list of demands to end fighting against the Lebanon-based terror group Hezbollah, according to a report from Axios. Two Israeli officials and two American officials relayed the demands for a ceasefire to the outlet, which were mostly focused on ensuring that Israel maintains the right to continue military action against Hezbollah. Jerusalem is demanding 'active enforcement' against Hezbollah, presumably meaning that it can engage Hezbollah military to ensure it does not rebuild its terror infrastructure along the border. The Israeli Air Force also wants continued access to Lebanese airspace. A Biden administration official said it was 'highly unlikely' that the international community and Lebanon would not accept Israel's conditions for ending the war. The White House and U.S. State Department did not respond to media requests asking to confirm the report. The report comes as U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Amos Hochstein is set to visit Beirut on Monday in an attempt to secure a diplomatic solution to end the conflict. International criticism of Israel's war against Hezbollah has ramped up in recent days, as the IDF has destroyed UNIFIL outposts in southern Lebanon. Israel has argued that UNIFIL has failed to enforce UN Resolution 1701, which mandates that Hezbollah forces cannot be present south of the Litani River. Therefore, UNIFIL troops must withdraw from the area in order to enable the IDF to clear the region of Hezbollah terrorists and infrastructure. In a Sunday phone call, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed to Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump that Israel will not bow to international pressure, including from Washington, regarding its prosecution of the war. Netanyahu 'reiterated what he has also said publicly: Israel takes into account the issues the U.S. administration raises, but in the end, will make its decisions based on its national interests,' read a statement from the Prime Minister's office.

Trump serves fries under the Golden Arches, drawing attention to ...	While her campaign originally said she worked there 'to pay her way through college,' Harris was forced to dial back that claim and has since said she worked the job for extra cash. By Joseph Simonson, The Washington Free Beacon In a made-for-TV effort to raise questions about one of his opponent's central campaign claims, former president Donald Trump worked a short shift at a Bucks County, Pa., McDonald’s on Sunday afternoon. Speaking through a drive-thru window at a Feasterville-Trevose McDonald’s franchise, Trump, sporting a McDonald’s apron, told reporters, 'Now I have worked at McDonald’s. I’ve now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala, she never worked here.' He was referring to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris's claim to have worked at the fast-food chain for a summer during college. While her campaign originally said she worked there 'to pay her way through college,' Harris was forced to dial back that claim and has since said she worked the job for extra cash. Given the campaign's shifting narratives about the job, a Washington Free Beacon report in August raised questions about whether Harris had actually worked at McDonald's. Since then, neither she nor her campaign have substantiated the claim, though the New York Times on Sunday said it had located a Harris pal to whom Harris's deceased mother had mentioned the gig. 'The campaign did not make any of Ms. Harris's friends or family members available for interviews about their recollections of her experience there,' the Times said. Harris has stopped mentioning her stint at McDonald’s on the campaign trail since the Free Beacon report in August. The job was initially featured in super PAC ads and stump speeches. Trump’s visit to that particular McDonald’s was no coincidence. Located in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Bucks County is considered a critical swing district in the state. 'Well I do appreciate [McDonald’s’] a little bit more, yeah. You take it for granted, I’ll never forget this experience,' Trump told the Free Beacon when asked if his time at the fry station changed his opinion of the restaurant’s food. 'Now I know how to do it.' The Times on Sunday dubbed Trump’s claims that Harris never worked at McDonald’s 'burgerism,' a new form of 'birtherism,' a reference to the belief that former president Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Although the paper said Harris’s campaign 'did not make any of [her] friends or family members available for interviews about their recollections of her experience there,' it nonetheless concluded that Trump’s allegation 'appears to be false.' The Times, which credited six reporters with contributing to the story, left unmentioned the fact that the Harris campaign's claims about the job have changed and that Harris's biographer, Dan Morain, told the Free Beacon in August that he was 'not aware' that Harris had worked at McDonald's. Though the Harris campaign refused to provide any information to the Times about the circumstances of Harris's work at the restaurant, the paper wrote that 'as with the birtherism conspiracy theory, this one puts Ms. Harris and her aides in something of a bind. Tracking down pay stubs or other documentation from so long ago would be a difficult task for almost anyone.' Obama did in fact produce a birth certificate demonstrating that he was born in the United States.

‘A warrior and commander’: Israel mourns one of highest-ranking o...	Five colonels have fallen in combat since Hamas’s October 7 attack, and Daqsa is the highest-ranking officer to killed since then. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Israeli leaders mourned on Sunday the death of one of the highest-ranking army officers killed since the Gaza ground war began. Col. Ehsan Daqsa, who commanded the Israel Defense Force’s 401st Armored Brigade, was killed in battle in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza. 'Ehsan was a hero of Israel, a warrior, and a commander — a role model for the bond with the Druze community. He dedicated his life to the security of Israel and its citizens. I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife Huda and their children, Omri, Reef, and Yasmin. We are all praying for the recovery of our brave wounded,' said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Daqsa and another battalion commander were critically injured by an explosive device when they exited their tanks to do a tactical observation. 'Known for his humility and valor, Daqsa had been leading his brigade since the start of the war and had previously received the Medal of Valor for his bravery during the Second Lebanon War,' Hagari said. 'On October 7, he transitioned directly from his studies into combat in the south and has been fighting ever since. He took command of the 401st Armored Brigade around four months ago.' Hagari added that Daqsa led the battle at Tel Sultan in Rafah when he assumed command and directed the brigade, 'which likely prevented [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar’s escape. From there, he continued to lead the battle in Jabaliya, where the brigade remains engaged. Ehsan led from the front and fell while guiding his soldiers.' Rafiq Halabi, Mayor of Daliyat al-Karmel local council, where Daqsa’s family resides, also paid tribute to Daqsa on X, formerly known as Twitter. 'He was a brave, legendary warrior who has fought since the beginning of the war. The Druze community, the IDF, and the State of Israel have lost one of their greatest heroes,' Halabi tweeted. The 41-year-old Daqsa is survived by his wife and three children. Five colonels have fallen in combat since Hamas’s October 7 attack, and Daqsa is the highest-ranking officer to killed since then. Eleven Druze soldiers, including Daqsa, have fallen in duty since October 7, including nine near or in Gaza, and two in northern Israel. Since Israel’s founding, 440 Druze soldiers have been killed in action. The Druze communities of Israel, Lebanon and Syria regard themselves as descendants of the Biblical Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses. They speak Arabic but are not Muslim. Around 152,000 Druze live in Israel, making up roughly two percent of the population. The Druze living in the Galilee and Mount Carmel areas sided with the Jews in 1948 during Israel’s War of Independence, opting to be part of Israeli society and establishing themselves in all areas of public life. The bond between Jewish and Druze soldiers is referred to as the 'covenant of blood.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Nova massacre survivor commits suicide on her 22nd birthday	The government needs to wake up. If it doesn't, there will be more cases like this,' says late Nova survior's brother. By World Israel News Staff A young woman who survived the Nova Festival massacre on October 7th committed suicide on her 22nd birthday, her family announced on Sunday evening. Shirel Golan, who escaped from the largest slaughter of Jews in a single incident since the Holocaust, was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and had been struggling with her mental health in the year since October 7th. According to her family members, Shirel hid in shrubbery for hours during the terror onslaught. Eventually, she tried to escape from the festival in a car driven by her friends, but then exited the vehicle and entered a police car. All 11 occupants of the civilian car were murdered by Hamas terrorists. Golan was one of some 200 survivors driven to safety in the police car by Officer Ramo Salman Abu-Zkeil. Her brother, Eyal, said that the state had failed to provide Shirel with adequate psychological support, despite the family's repeated attempts to get help for her. 'We are five siblings, and she was the youngest. The government needs to wake up. If it doesn't, there will be more cases like this,' he told Ynet. 'If the state had provided proper care, this wouldn't have happened. I've lost my sister, but I want to raise an outcry so others don't lose their loved ones.' Eyal told Channel 12 News that their 'mother was forced to take early retirement to be next to her daughter. We didn’t move a millimeter from her, and the only time we left her alone was today, and she decided to take her own life.' Abu-Zkeil said he was devastated by Golan's death, saying they had been in touch nearly every day since her rescue. 'On October 7th, I can say that I did the everything I could to prevent the people I rescued from seeing horrors. But the screams, the gunshots, and the images of what happened are things none of us can forget,' he told Walla. 'As a police officer, I receive talk therapy with a psychologist from the state. But Nova survivors only get pills.' The Ministry of Welfare and Social Services said in a statement that it 'expresses deep pain over the untimely death of the Nova survivor, and shares in the grief of the family and the sorrow of the entire Nova community.'

IDF still hasn’t internalized the tunnel threat, experts say	One of the reasons Israel has not fully embraced tunnels is that its attention and resources are drawn to other, more pressing threats. By David Isaac, JNS Tunnels have proven to be a critical threat to the Jewish state. While the Israel Defense Forces certainly hasn’t ignored them, it has been slow to grasp their strategic significance. Some argue that it still hasn’t. 'I still don’t see the necessary change in the IDF’s worldview that would allow us to better deal with this phenomenon of underground warfare,' Yehuda Kfir, a civil engineer and researcher of subterranean warfare, told JNS. Professor Joel Roskin, a geomorphologist at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, has reached the same conclusion. Perhaps the best supporting example is that when the IDF built its defensive 'smart wall' (completed in 2021) between Israel and the Gaza Strip, it continued to let Hamas build all the underground infrastructure it pleased as long as it stayed on its side of the fence. The resulting underground city in Gaza, from which Hamas could command and control its forces, send them out to attack and recall them to shelter in place, has served to prolong the war and prevent Israel from saving the remaining hostages. It allowed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to elude Israeli forces for more than a year. Sinwar himself (along with 1,026 others) was released from Israeli prison in 2011 in exchange for IDF soldier Gilad Shalit—who had been kidnapped by terrorists who emerged from a tunnel. Kfir posits that Oct. 7 wouldn’t have happened if not for Hamas’s extensive tunnel system. 'Sinwar would not have dared invade as he did without this underground system from which he could continue to survive and function,' he told JNS. Kfir and Roskin’s conclusions have been echoed elsewhere. Asher Katz, an IDF reservist specializing in tunnels, said in an interview with David Harris of the Jewish Broadcasting Service in late September that it wasn’t until 2021 that it dawned on Israel that the tunnels were more than a Hamas tactic, (i.e., a way to move fighters from one place to another). They were rather Hamas’s entire 'strategic thesis,' he said; a means to fight, hide and survive. Hamas was thinking strategically, but Israel was thinking tactically, Asher said, adding, 'Israelis were super good at solving problems. Give us a problem, we’ll solve it. I don’t think we’re that good at strategy. Or we haven’t been good enough at strategy.' Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman told interviewer Dave Rubin on Oct. 9 that if he had one criticism of Israel’s Gaza war it was that it was taking too long, a fact he attributed to Hamas’s tunnel system. 'They [Hamas] got 350 miles’ worth of terror tunnels,' he said, adding that the Israelis didn’t understand what they were dealing with. 'Hamas, I say, had the greatest home court advantage in the history of ground warfare.' The IDF has significantly improved its tunnel operations over the last year, Kfir acknowledges, pointing to the army’s decision to move its forces underground in tandem with its above-ground forces. In the clip below, IDF Brig. Gen. Dan Goldfus describes such simultaneous troop movements. Israel is using the enemy’s own tunnels to advance. But Kfir said that’s not enough, that Israel is still leaving the initiative to the enemy. The modern battlefield has become multi-level, but Israel is neglecting an entire level, he said. He likens it to a Navy without submarines, one that operates only on the surface. Kfir and Roskin, who concede they’re currently in the minority on the topic, argue that Israel must build its own attack tunnels. The concept may sound 'sci-fi,' but they depict a subterranean battlefield in which Israeli forces dig tunnels to carry out their own operations and to counter those of the enemy. Said Roskin, 'If you don’t dig yourself and experience the construction process, the routine of life within a tunnel, you don’t really understand what it’s all about.' Kfir and Roskin recently distributed a report on offensive tunneling to various individuals in the IDF, from engineering, intelligence, research and development and other units. 'Nobody called us even to discuss it,' said Roskin. One of the reasons is that responsibility for tunnels is diffuse. There isn’t a single address for tunnels in the army. Kfir and Roskin argue an organizational change needs to take place—the establishment of an IDF branch dedicated solely to underground warfare. The IDF tells JNS that tunnels are handled by Yahalom, a special forces unit of the Israeli Combat Engineering Corps. However, Yahalom’s duties include more than just tunnels. When asked by JNS about a special tunnel lab set up in 2018, the 'Technological Laboratory for Tunnel Detection and Locations,' which specifically focuses on detecting and locating tunnels, the IDF said that it operates under the Gaza Division, separate from Yahalom. 'We have been advocating, given the wide ranges of uses of tunnels by Hamas, and now by Hezbollah, a separate branch, or at least a large research-to-engagement unit in the military,' said Roskin. The IDF is only now learning the extent of Hezbollah’s tunnels in southern Lebanon. Early last week, it uncovered an 800-meter (~0.5 mile) tunnel designed as a launching pad for an attack on northern Israel. According to reports, Hezbollah had planned its own Oct. 7-style massacre on Israel’s northern communities (its scale would have been far worse than the Hamas attack, the reports say). After visiting the tunnel, Channel 14’s military reporter Noam Amir said it was larger than the IDF’s 800-meter estimate, because there were turn-offs to rooms, one containing a giant generator, another a huge hangar, and others leading to sleeping quarters, kitchens and weapons stores. 'I walked for 45 minutes, which felt like several kilometers,' he said. 'They [Hezbollah] have food there for many months. With a long shelf life, you could divide it up for years. It’s not the dates and nuts that were given to the terrorists in the tunnels in Gaza. And you see mopeds. And you see a room for terrorists with plasma TVs … And you say to yourself, what have they built under our noses for more than two decades?' said Amir. One of the reasons Israel has not fully embraced tunnels is that its attention and resources are drawn to other, more pressing threats. 'Missiles travel 15,000 miles per hour. Tunnels advance one-to-five meters per day,' Roskin pointed out. Underground warfare is not just Israel’s problem, but a world problem, Kfir said. This is in part because bad actors have been inspired by Hamas’s ability to last as long as it has, despite Israel’s entire military and political establishment being mobilized against it. America is quietly concerned about China invading Taiwan via tunnel, Kfir noted, saying it is possible engineering-wise to dig under the Taiwan Strait. 'The Chinese are taking over the world market in TBM (Tunnel Boring Machines),' he said. 'There is almost no company today in this field that is not controlled by them.' Will tunnels again become a threat from Gaza? That fear is already being aired by some. IDF Lt. Col. (ret.) Jonathan Conricus has voiced his concerns that the military may not be doing enough to counter a future tunnel threat under the Philadelphi Corridor along the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. The IDF is going after specific tunnel entrances in a 'pinpoint solution' rather than a 'systemic solution' that deals with all the tunnels, Conricus told JNS. 'What’s needed is to create a permanent change, or at least one that’s more long lasting.' Conricus suggests an underground barrier, 'a type of defensive wall,' similar to what Israel built around the Gaza Strip, which prevented Hamas from using tunnels in their Oct. 7 attack. It’s called a 'slurry wall' and involves 'digging a deep trench, dozens of meters deep, and filling it with concrete that has sensors in it, that basically cuts across the border. It doesn’t make it impossible to dig a tunnel, but it makes it very, very difficult,' he said. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Israel will keep troops in the Philadelphi Corridor, Conricus said there are no guarantees. Pressure is being applied by the United States and Egypt, putting a damper on the idea. A slurry wall would give Israel at least some measure of control over what happens under the Strip if it is forced to leave, he said. The Philadelphi Corridor is where all the problems started, Kfir noted. In the 1980s, Israel had its first encounter with tunnels in the form of underground smuggling by terrorists. The IDF struggled to counter it. The terrorists’ initial success led them to expand their use of tunnels, planting explosives under IDF outposts. They blew up their first in 2001. Roskin said Israeli troops will need to be on the border. 'If Israel wants to have control of the Gaza Strip, they have to control the Philadelphi Corridor, hands-on, on the ground,' he said. Even IDF officers who advocated for the 2005 disengagement from Gaza argued at the time that Israel must keep the Philadelphi Corridor. 'They were pretty shocked that [then-Prime Minister] Ariel Sharon was going to give up Philadelphi. We’ve seen the price we’ve paid,' said Roskin.

Trump clears margin of error in crucial swing state	With its 16 electoral votes, North Carolina is one of seven consensus battleground states that collectively control 93 electoral votes. By Jewish Breaking News With the 2024 presidential election expected to come down to the wire, political pundits widely agree North Carolina may very well be the deciding factor in who takes the White House this November. A fresh poll from Rasmussen Reports and American Thinker shows Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris by 51% to 46% among likely voters in North Carolina. With a margin of error of +/- 3% and a 95% level of confidence, this marks the first time either candidate has secured a statistically significant advantage in the state. On key issues, the economy remains the top concern for North Carolina voters at 33%, followed by border security at 17% and abortion at 12%. Significantly, 70% of respondents prefer 'major change' in how the next president governs rather than 'business as usual.' However, voters seemed to place very little importance (3%) on global conflicts, such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. With its 16 electoral votes, North Carolina is one of seven consensus battleground states that collectively control 93 electoral votes. Trump’s appeal in North Carolina has been consistent across the last two presidential cycles. He claimed victory in 2020 with 49.9% of the vote versus 48.6% for Biden-Harris, mirroring his 2016 win where he garnered 49.8% to Clinton-Kaine’s 46.2%. In both instances, Trump’s final numbers exceeded predictions from September and October polls. Historically, North Carolina has consistently leaned Republican in presidential races for over half a century. Since Lyndon B. Johnson’s victory in 1964, Democrats have only managed to capture the state twice with Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Barack Obama in 2008.

Abandon Harris'—formerly 'Abandon Biden'—demands a 'permanent and unconditional ceasefire' and 'a full arms embargo against the State of Israel,' according to the group’s website. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon The anti-Israel organization 'Abandon Harris' expanded its movement into Wisconsin and Georgia in order 'to ensure that Kamala Harris loses the swing states,' the Washington Times reported. In a bid to divert votes from Harris in response to her stance on the Israel-Hamas war, the group is promoting Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who has pledged to end all military support to Israel. 'Abandon Harris,' which began in Michigan, expanded its campaigns to Wisconsin and Georgia this week as Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump remain in a tight battle in the key swing states. 'Abandon Harris'—formerly 'Abandon Biden'—demands a 'permanent and unconditional ceasefire' and 'a full arms embargo against the state of Israel,' according to the group’s website. 'We have become familiar with the way in which the president and vice president double-talk to our community by making vague allusions of ending the genocidal war while permitting the state of Israel to continue their attacks on innocent people on the verge of disintegration,' Hassan Abdel Salam, a spokesman for the group, told the Washington Times. Salam told the Times that Harris teases talks of a ceasefire in Gaza only to court Arab-American voters. 'The vice president engages in ‘cease-fire teasing’—a common practice that began with [President Biden]—by claiming that a cease-fire is on the horizon while children, women, and men are in flames, burning before our eyes,' he said. The 'Abandon Harris' group’s expansion into the two swing states comes as Harris struggles to regain the support of Arab-American voters, who historically supported Democrats before the start of the Israel-Hamas war. An October Arab American Institute survey found that the national Arab-American vote is split between Trump and Harris, 42 percent to 41 percent. Harris remains 18 points below Biden’s 2020 level of support with Arab-American voters. Among Muslim voters in Wisconsin, Harris trails Stein, 44 percent to 39 percent, while Trump holds only 8 percent of the vote, according to a poll from Marquette University.

Sinwar’s wife blasted for carrying $32,000 Birkin handbag	The Birkin line of luxury handbags, made by Hermes, a French company, cost tens of thousands of dollars. By Pesach Benson, TPS Yahya Sinwar’s wife, Samar Abu Zamer, was blasted on social media on Sunday after surveillance footage released by Israel showed her carrying what appears to be a $32,000 handbag as she and her family went into hiding. 'Did Sinwar’s wife enter the tunnel with him on October 6, carrying a Birkin bag estimated to cost about $32,000?! I will leave the comment to you,' tweeted Col. Avichay Adraee, the Israel Defense Force’s Arabic-language spokesperson. 'While the people of Gaza do not have enough money for a tent or basic necessities, we see many examples of Yahya Sinwar and his wife’s special love for money,' Adraee added. The footage dated October 6, 2023, the day before Hamas’s attack on Israel, showed Sinwar, his two children and Abu Zamer passing through a tunnel. She was carrying what appeared to be a French-made Birkin handbag. The Birkin line of luxury handbags, made by Hermes, a French company, cost tens of thousands of dollars. 'Yes. That appears to be a black Hermes Birkin 25, estimated retail value $32,500 — but you also have to buy $32,500 (an equal amount) at Hermes to qualify to buy,' tweeted writer Emily Zanotti. 'So let’s say, conservatively, they stole $65K from Gaza residents just to buy Sinwar’s wife a handbag.' Sinwar, who masterminded the October 7 attacks was killed in a chance encounter with Israeli soldiers in Rafah on Thursday. He had a personal wealth of several million dollars, not close to the billions personally accumulated by Ismail Haniyeh, Khalid Mashaal. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hezbollah launches 100 rockets at Israel’s Galilee	Police reported closures along Route 90 from north to south from the Rosh Pina Junction to the Amiad Junction following the launches. By JNS Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah launched approximately 100 rockets at northern Israel on Sunday, in two barrages. The first was a salvo of 70 rockets targeting northern Israel’s Western and Upper Galilee regions late Sunday morning, the Israel Defense Forces said. Some of the projectiles were intercepted, while several impacts were detected, according to the IDF. Israel Fire and Rescue Services were operating to extinguish multiple fires sparked by the attack. There were no immediate reports of injuries or material damage. Just a few hours later, the Iranian terror proxy launched some 30 rockets at Safed and surrounding areas of the Upper Galilee. Sirens also sounded in Katzrin in the southern Golan Heights. Residents of Safed reported multiple interceptions in the skies over the city. No injuries or direct hits were reported, but several fires were reported. Police reported closures along Route 90 from north to south from the Rosh Pina Junction to the Amiad Junction following the launches. One rocket exploded on the road near the Elifelet interchange.

Per IDF protocol, no sirens were sounded because the threat, apparently a drone, did not make landfall. The incident came a day after a Hezbollah drone attack on the Caesarea residents of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Shortly afterward on Sunday morning, sirens sound in the northwestern port city and the surrounding area, as well as in the Upper Galilee. Residents reported hearing one interception; Magen David Adom emergency services said they had received no calls about impacts or casualties. The military later confirmed that it shot down one rocket and that two projectiles fell in an open area in a second wave at northern Israel. Sirens had sounded in Merom Golan in the northern Golan Heights at around 4:20 a.m. on Sunday due to a drone that had crossed into Israeli airspace from Syria. The threat was intercepted by the Israeli Air Force. Another drone had triggered sirens in several communities in the southern Golan several hours earlier. That drone too was intercepted, as was another UAV approaching from the east that according to the IDF did not enter Israeli airspace. A drone was also intercepted on Saturday night near Eilat in southern Israel. No injuries were reported in either the Golan and Eilat drone attacks, which were claimed by the Islamic Resistance of Iraq, a group of Iranian-backed militias. The terrorist group has conducted many drone attacks against Israel over the past year in support of Hamas in Gaza. Alarms were also heard elsewhere in northern Israel overnight, including in the Upper Galilee area, where five projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon around midnight, according to the IDF, which said that some were intercepted while others fell in open areas. On Saturday morning, a Hezbollah drone impacted near Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea. The drone was one of three launched by Hezbollah, two of which were intercepted. The Lebanese terrorist group launched some 200 projectiles at Israel throughout Saturday. One of the rockets killed a man near Acre, who was later identified as Alexei Popov, 51, from the Haifa suburb of Kiryat Haim.

ISIS terror attack on Israeli embassy in Germany foiled	Terrorist plot orchestrated by Libyan affiliated with ISIS targeted Israel's mission to Berlin, German authorities announce. By World Israel News Staff German authorities foiled a planned terrorist attack against the Israeli embassy in Berlin over the weekend, the state prosecutor’s office announced on Sunday. The suspect has been identified only as 'Omar A.,' a 28-year-old Libyan national residing in Germany who according to a statement by the Public Prosecutor of Germany’s office, is affiliated with the Islamic State in Syria terrorist organization. Omar A. allegedly contacted an ISIS operative abroad via an online chat service to assist him in planning the attack. After the attack, Omar A. had planned to find refuge at his uncle’s residence, before fleeing the country, Bild reported. Prosecutors did not reveal details of the suspect’s planned attack. Police arrested Omar A. on Saturday in Bernau, a town near Berlin, local media outlets reported. Omar is slated to be brought before a Federal Court of Justice on Monday for an extension of his remand. According to a statement by a spokesperson for the national prosecutor, police were tipped off about the terror plot by a foreign intelligence agency, while declining to name which country was involved in foiling the attack. 'Muslim antisemitism is no longer just hateful rhetoric; it leads to and encourages terrorist activities worldwide,' said Israeli Ambassador to Germany Ron Prosor on Sunday. 'This is yet another example of Israeli embassies being on the front line of the diplomatic battlefield. I would like to commend the German law enforcement authorities for their intensive efforts to ensure the safety of the official representatives of the State of Israel.' Nancy Faeser, the Federal Minister of the Interior and Community of Germany, touted Omar A.’s timely arrest. 'Our security authorities acted in time to thwart possible plans to attack the Israeli embassy in Berlin,’ Faeser tweeted on Sunday. 'This shows that protecting Jewish and Israeli institutions in our country is vital and of the utmost importance to us.'

British lawmakers, city officials demand full arms embargo on Isr...	Members of ruling Labour Party back parliamentary motion calling on Stamer government to ban all military exports to Israel. By World Israel News Staff Dozens of British lawmakers have signed on to a parliamentary motion demanding the Starmer government ban all sales of weapons and military equipment to Israel, despite a pledge by Prime Minister Keir Starmer not to impose a sweeping arms embargo on the Jewish state. Separately, over 100 British city councillors have petitioned the government to adopt a similar arms embargo. Earlier this month, a total of 51 Members of Parliament in the 650-member legislature backed a measure, an Early Day Motion proposed by Leeds East MP Richard Burgon, which demands the British government nix the 2030 Roadmap for UK-Israel Bilateral Relations, a sweeping agreement signed in 2023 aimed at deepening cooperation between the two countries with regards to cyber technology, security, health, climate change, to promote increased trade. The motion, dubbed 'UN’s Resolution on Israel’s Illegal Occupation of Palestine and Sanctions,' also calls on Britain to end 'all military exports to Israel,' citing a United Nations General Assembly non-binding resolution, and to ban imports from Israeli towns outside of the pre-1967 Green Line. The UN measure, drafted by the Palestinian Authority mission and passed on September 18th, called for sanctions on Israel and a global arms embargo. The EDM submitted to the British Parliament similarly calls on London to 'act in support of the UN resolution and ICJ opinion including by ending all military exports to Israel, banning the import of goods from illegal Israeli settlements and revoking the 2030 Roadmap which deepens UK economic, trade and security ties with Israel.' Twenty-one Labour MPs signed onto the motion, with 30 other MPs including independents and lawmakers from the Scottish Independence Party, the Green Party, the Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru backing the measure. In addition, last week, 114 Muslim city councillors aligned with the Labour Party signed a petition calling on Starmer to impose an 'immediate and complete suspension of arms sales to Israel.' 'In the past few days alone we have seen images of Palestinian children and families burnt alive following Israeli military strikes at Al Aqsa hospital, and the continued shelling of schools used as shelter by displaced civilians,' the petition, drafted by the Labour Muslim Network, reads. 'That is why we have come together, as councillors, as Muslims, and as Labour members, to call on this Labour government to meet our moral obligation by suspending all arms sales to Israel until such a time that international humanitarian law is observed and respected.' A day before the Early Day Motion was brought before Parliament, Prime Minister Starmer declared that he would not back a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel, calling it the 'wrong position.' 'Banning all sales would mean none for defensive purposes.' 'None for defensive purposes on the anniversary of October 7 and days after a huge attack by Iran into Israel would be a wrong position for this government and I will not take it,' Starmer continued.

Professor of international law calls Sinwar’s killing ‘murder,’ d...	Canadian international law professor specializing in war crimes decries elimination of top Hamas terrorist as ‘murder,’ demands Canada push for investigation of IDF’s killing of Yahya Sinwar. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Israeli military’s killing of the leader of the Hamas terror organization was illegal under international law, constitutes murder, and is a war crime, a Canadian international law professor claims, pushing the Canadian government to demand an investigation of the incident. Heidi Matthews, an international law professor focusing on the study of laws of war at the York University in Toronto’ Osgoode Hall Law School, on Friday lambasted Israel’s elimination of Hamas politburo chairman and chief of Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar, the architect of the October 7th, 2023, invasion of Israel and massacre of 1,200 Israelis, was killed Wednesday during a gun battle with IDF troops in Tel al-Sultan in the southern edge of Rafah near the Egyptian border. During the battle between Sinwar, his bodyguards, and IDF forces, an Israeli soldier was seriously wounded. An IDF tank sent to support the troops opened fire on the building where Sinwar was holed up, leaving the terrorist leader injured. Despite his injuries, Sinwar managed to throw several hand grenades at IDF soldiers as they stormed the building, forcing them to withdraw, while the tank’s machine gun turret and other soldiers provided covering fire aimed at Sinwar. A drone aircraft was sent into the building to ascertain Sinwar’s condition. The wounded terrorist threw a piece of wood in an attempt to knock down the drone. Sinwar’s remains were later found with an AK-47 assault rifle. A day after Sinwar’s killing, shortly after forensics investigators in Israel confirmed his identity, French Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hailed Sinwar’s death, calling it the end of 'a reign of terror' in the Gaza Strip. 'Under Sinwar’s leadership, Hamas carried out the horrific atrocities of October 7, sought to destroy Israel, and launched senseless, devastating terror attacks on civilians across the region. Today delivers a measure of justice for his victims and their families,' Trudeau said. Taking to X/Twitter Friday, Matthews called on Trudeau’s government to push for a probe of Sinwar’s killing, claiming that it constituted murder and a war crime. 'There is good reason to believe that Sinwar was, in fact, murdered by the IDF,’ Matthews wrote. 'Rather than celebrating death using inflammatory language of ‘elimination’, Canada should be demanding that Israel comply with an independent investigation into the circumstances of Sinwar's death.' Sinwar, Matthews argued, could no longer be considered a combatant and thus a legitimate target after being wounded, claiming the additional shots fired were prohibited under the 1949 Geneva Convention. 'Briefly for now: individuals who are rendered 'hors to combat' (no longer in the fight) by virtue of wounding cannot be targeted. To do so is a violation of common article 3 to the 1949 Geneva Conventions and a war crime under the art. 8(2)(c)(i) of the Rome Statute.' 'The relevant question is whether Sinwar was incapacitated by his wounds such that he was disabled from participating in fighting and no longer posed a threat. This question is easier to answer when fighters are unconscious or on the ground.'

‘If Israel had listened to Biden, Sinwar would still be alive’ – ...	Israel's elimination of top Hamas terrorist was a result of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's defiance of the Biden administration's efforts to end the Gaza war, block Israel from entering Rafah, experts say. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration last week congratulated Israel and the IDF on the killing of Yahya Sinwar - chief of the Hamas politburo, leader of Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip, and architect of the October 7th invasion – lauding his elimination as 'relief' and the removal of 'an insurmountable obstacle' to ceasefire talks. A number Middle East and counter-terrorism experts, however, say Sinwar’s elimination would not have been possible had Israel followed calls by the Biden administration to end the war against Hamas or caved to pressure from the White House not to enter the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where Sinwar was ultimately shot and killed. Since the beginning of 2024, the Biden administration has urged Israel to end its war in the Gaza Strip and reach a permanent ceasefire with Hamas. At the same time, the White house repeatedly warned Israel not to enter Rafah, saying a large-scale operation in the city, which prior to the operation housed roughly half of Gaza’s population – most of them internally displaced refugees – would inevitably result in massive civilian casualties. 'We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake,' Harris told ABC News in March.'Let me tell you something. I have studied the maps. There's nowhere for those folks to go.' Even after IDF forces launched the Rafah offensive on May 6th, seizing control over the border crossings with Egypt, the White house persisted in pressuring Israel not to advance into the city of Rafah itself. 'The president doesn’t want to see operations in Rafah that put at greater risk the more than a million people that are seeking refuge there,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on May 6th, after Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone, urging him not to expand the ground operation into Rafah proper. Two days later, Biden warned that he would bar the transfer of heavy aerial ordinance to Israel if the IDF entered the city of Rafah. 'I made it clear that if they go into Rafah – they haven’t gone in Rafah yet – if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities – that deal with that problem,' Biden told CNN. American-Israeli journalist Caroline Glick, who ran for Knesset with Naftali Bennett in 2019, excoriated Kamala Harris over her March comments, tweeting: 'Sinwar was killed in Rafah - a mile from the Egyptian border. Kamala threatened Israel with sanctions if we went in. Oh, and she studied the maps.' Lt. Col. (Res.) Yoni Chetboun, a former Israeli lawmaker who served as Deputy Speaker of the Knesset and former officer in the IDF’s elite Egoz counter-terror unit, told Fox News that had Israel adhered to the Biden administration’s demands, Sinwar would not have been eliminated. 'Had Prime Minister Netanyahu listened to Biden and Harris and not entered Rafah, we may have never reached Sinwar. The people of America and Israel overwhelmingly supported our entry into Rafah and want to see Hamas committed to the annals of history. Now it's time to finish Hamas and bring home the hostages.' Counter-terrorism expert and Northwestern University professor Max Abrahms echoed Chetboun’s comments. 'Had Netanyahu heeded that advice, Sinwar would be alive,' Abrahms told Fox News. 'Israel is safer for ignoring this White House, an important lesson as Netanyahu weighs military options against Iran.' When asked last Thursday whether the administration’s calls not to enter Rafah had been mistaken in light of Sinwar’s elimination, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller refused to walk back the administration’s admonitions. 'No, I will say that we always made clear that we supported Israel conducting counterterrorism operations to target the leaders of Hamas and to target Hamas militants. And not only did we make clear we supported it, but we provided active intelligence support for those operations. And I think I’ll leave it at that.'

Entrepreneur offers $100,000 reward to Gazans for hostage info	Former SodaStream CEO offers to personally pay Gazans who provide intelligence leading to the rescue of living hostages. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli entrepreneur has pledged to personally pay a $100,000 reward in cash or Bitcoin to Gazans who provide information leading to the recovery of living Israeli hostages still held in the Strip. Daniel Birnbuam, the former CEO of SodaStream, released a video including Arabic subtitles offering a financial incentive to Gazans who could assist in locating captives. 'This year was a terrible year. It's time to wrap things up and move on. A few days ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered free passage and immunity to anyone who delivers an Israeli prisoner to Israel,' Birnbaum said in the video. 'I would like to add to that a financial reward. Anyone who delivers from Gaza a living Israeli prisoner will receive $100,000&#8230;don't wait. This offer is valid is offer until Wednesday, midnight, October 24th,' he continued. Birnbaum then provided a phone number, which he said Gazans can reach either via WhatsApp or Telegram. He promised that the identities of those who contact the hotline will be kept private, and that he will 'make the appropriate arrangements' to ensure their safe passage out of the Strip. 'Don't wait. It's time to take control of your life, to build a future for yourself, for your family, and for your community. Do it today,' he added. In an interview on Sunday morning, Birnbaum clarified that he is working 'shoulder to shoulder' with Israel's security apparatus. The hotline has 'already been flooded with 50 messages,' Birnbaum told the Morning News with Niv Raskin. 'Of course, some of them are fake, but they are all being seriously examined by intelligence services.' Birnbaum stressed that his offer marks 'the first time that cash has been on the table for the release of the hostages.' He said he hoped that the financial reward would provide a push to motivate Gazans to disclose intelligence that could save hostages' lives. 'It's time to try something new,' he said.

2 IDF soldiers killed in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya	Two soldiers killed by anti-tank missile during offensive against Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Two Israeli soldiers were killed during combat in the city of Jabaliya on Saturday, as the IDF intensifies its offensive against Hamas terrorists still in the northern Gaza Strip. The two fallen troops were identified in an IDF press release as Staff Sgt. Ofir Berkovich, 20, from the central city of Modi’in, and Sgt. Elishai Young, 19, from the southern city of Dimona. Both soldiers were serving in the 401st Armored Brigade’s 52nd Battalion. According to a statement from the IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, they were killed when their armored vehicle was struck by an anti-tank missile fired by Hamas terrorists. Berkovich, who had finished nearly all of his mandatory service, was already planning a post-army intentional trip with his brothers, his family said. His parents, Oren and Aviv, said that his organs would be donated to save the lives of others. 'On behalf of all the residents of the city of Dimona, I share in the Young family's grief over the death of their son Elishai, a hero of Israel,' said Benny Biton, the mayor of Dimona, in a media statement. 'Elishai belongs to the Hebrew Israelite community in the city,' Biton said, referring to a group of African-Americans who claim Jewish roots that immigrated to southern Israel several decades ago from the U.S. The Black Israelites are 'a community that donates and volunteers' for the betterment of Israeli society, Biton said. He noted that the community has a '100% enlistment rate in the IDF, indicating their love for the country and their desire to integrate into it, especially for its defense.' The killing of Berkovich and Young bring the death toll in the Israeli offensive in Gaza to 357. That number includes Yamam special forces police officer Arnon Zmora, who was killed during a June hostage rescue operation, and a civilian Defense Ministry contractor who was killed in May.

‘It’s real’ – Kamala Harris justifies protester’s claims of Israe...	I know what you're speaking of' - Vice President Kamala Harris legitimizes anti-Israel protesters accusations of genocide in the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Vice President Kamala Harris justified accusations posed by an anti-Israel protester who crashed a campaign event Thursday, after the protester claimed Israel is committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. Harris was joined by billionaire businessman and television personality Mark Cuban in a campaign stop at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Thursday, as the vice president's campaign works to bolster support in the battleground state where former President Donald Trump currently holds a 0.2% lead in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. During a gathering with students, an anti-Israel activist wearing a keffiyeh challenged Harris over the Biden administration's handling of the war in Gaza, claiming that the U.S. is enabling Israeli 'genocide' of Gazans. After the protester accused Israel of genocide, Harris neither affirmed nor denied his claims, but did appear to justify his accusations, saying that she knows 'what you're speaking of,' while reiterating the administration's call for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas terror organization. 'I know what you're speaking of,' said Harris. 'I want a cease-fire. I want the hostage deal done. I want the war to end.' The heckler interrupted Harris' response, repeating his claims of genocide in Gaza. 'But what about the genocide? What about the genocide though?' Harris attempted to silence the protester, saying: 'I respect your right to speak, but I'm speaking right now.' The protester continued to shout at the vice president as security guards removed him from the gathering. 'How about the billions of dollars to Israel?' the protester shouted. 'What about the 19,000 children dead, and you won't call it a genocide?' After the protester was removed, Harris continued to justify his claims, saying 'it's real.' 'Listen, what he’s talking about, it’s real,' said Harris. 'That’s not the subject that I came to discuss today, but it’s real, and I respect his voice.'

Car-ramming attack near Jerusalem leaves terrorist dead	No officers were injured, and a bomb squad was sent to inspect the vehicle. By Jewish Breaking News An Arab terrorist, 27, from the Nablus area, rammed his car into a parked armored police vehicle on Route 60 near the town of Ofra (north of Jerusalem) in a car-ramming terror attack today. Security footage shows the car speeding toward officers before narrowly missing one. The driver was killed on impact.

An assault rifle, an UNRWA passport, and $11K in cash: What Sinwa...	The presence of an UNRWA passport in Sinwar's belongings is another blow to the humanitarian aid agency's already ailing image. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon When Israeli forces examined Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's body after killing him in a surprise ground operation on Thursday, they discovered several curious items, including grenades, an assault rifle, nearly $11,000 in cash, and a passport belonging to an employee of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. Those items, experts told the Washington Free Beacon, suggest Sinwar may have been attempting to flee the embattled Gaza Strip when Israeli forces stumbled upon him inside a house in the territory's Rafah neighborhood, Hamas's stronghold along the border with Egypt. While it is unclear exactly what Sinwar was up to in that home, the documents in his possession hint at an escape plan. 'One big question is whether he was planning to try and run for it and run out of Gaza,' said Jonathan Conricus, a 24-year Israel Defense Forces veteran who now serves as a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. It's particularly curious, Conricus said, given that Sinwar is known to have had access to the sophisticated Hamas-built tunnel network running beneath Gaza and could have used it to flee into Egypt. The IDF worked earlier this year to demolish many of those cross-border tunnels, complicating a prospective Sinwar exit. The presence of an UNRWA passport in Sinwar's belongings is another blow to the humanitarian aid agency's already ailing image. The United States and other Western countries froze aid to UNRWA after reports revealed that several of the agency's employees had participated in Hamas's Oct. 7 terror massacre. Since that time, Hamas has repeatedly been caught siphoning off aid and continuing to use UNRWA facilities for safe haven and even operational planning. 'Having access to a humanitarian passport—even if expired in 2017—could possibly provide access to humanitarian corridors to evacuate a crisis zone,' said Riza Kumar, a research analyst with the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit policy group. 'Given that only two others died alongside Sinwar, his small entourage suggests he was attempting to make moves that wouldn't be so easily detected.' Sinwar was killed alongside his longtime bodyguard and another senior Hamas member responsible for handling the terror leader's communications with the outside world. It is possible the UNRWA-issued passport and various Palestinian government IDs found at the site of Sinwar's death could have helped the small cohort of terrorists make their way to safer territory as Israeli forces patrol Rafah, hunting down Hamas's remaining terrorists. 'The fact Sinwar felt compelled to leave his secure subterranean hideout and emerge into the Tal as-Sultan streets, with only two other fighters in support, suggests a severe disintegration of Hamas command-and-control structures,' Kumar said. 'Likely Sinwar had also lost confidence in his senior commanders in taking such a risk.' At the same time, Kumar said, 'carrying the passport of a much younger man, with a 1984 [birthdate], probably rules out the notion of [Sinwar's] intending to use it or flee across the Egypt-Gaza border.' UNRWA says that it had no knowledge of Sinwar's whereabouts and that the presence of its employee's passport at the scene does not mean the aid group was in communication with Hamas's now-former leader. 'I confirm that the staff member in question is alive,' UNRWA commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X. 'He currently lives in Egypt where he traveled with his family in April through the Rafah border.' The organization would not comment beyond this statement when reached Friday by the Free Beacon. But Sinwar's access to such a sensitive UNRWA document is still raising questions months after the organization was forced to admit that its employees not only played a role in the Oct. 7 attacks but also helped Hamas hide hostages. 'UNRWA is totally compromised. Every part of UNRWA is connected with Hamas, benefits Hamas, and in many cases, works for Hamas,' said Conricus. Anne Herzberg, a human rights lawyer and NGO Monitor legal adviser, noted that the discovery of UNRWA documents 'is indicative of the corruption and failure of that U.N. agency specifically, but the humanitarian aid industry in Gaza more generally.' Sinwar was also carrying Mentos candies when he was killed, items only available by having access to the tons of humanitarian aid being pumped into Gaza by UNRWA and international donors. That type of item, Conricus said, only 'comes in through the humanitarian aid, so obviously he had access, through his people or someone else, to get access to Mentos.' The former Israeli soldier also noted a curious omission from the goods found on Sinwar's body: a Quran. 'Even the most junior Hamas fighters, usually when they die, you find them with the Quran,' he said, describing Sinwar's lack of one as 'exceptional.' Also discovered on Sinwar's body were a stack of letters between him and his 10-year-old son. Their contents, reported in the Israeli media, include personal discussions of family life and radical jihadi rhetoric. The terror leader's son sent his father drawings of dead Israeli soldiers, and Sinwar, in turn, wrote about the need to destroy Israel through armed war.

Senior IDF officer calls for urgent upgrade to combat drones amid...	In Binyamina, a Hezbollah drone struck a dining hall at a Golani brigade training base, killing four and wounding 60. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A senior IDF official called for an urgent upgrade in short-range aerial defense capabilities following a deadly drone strike last week at a training base in Binyamina. In addition, a Hezbollah drone attempted to strike the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea and hit a nearby building with no alarms heard in the area. 'The Israel Air Force has not built a proper force to deal with drone threats on such a large scale, despite the significant successes in the North,' Walla quoted a senior reserve officer as saying on Thursday. The senior officer described the situation as 'a fundamental issue' and pointed out that in many situations, four fighter helicopters and a missile ship are needed to chase just one drone. 'We knew this, just like the IAF didn't develop its ground support capabilities for the border forces well enough. On the other hand, it developed its long-range fighting capabilities across seven different theaters quite impressively,' he continued. Last week, a Hezbollah drone struck a dining hall in a Golani brigade training base, killing four and wounding 60. A baffling aspect of the incident is that the military tracked the drone, tried to intercept it, and reported it had fallen into the sea when, in reality, it had penetrated layers of defense. Civilians had spotted the drones in the sky, but no warnings and sirens were heard. 'No defense system is completely airtight, even with advanced technologies,' says Dr. Liran Antebi, a senior visiting researcher at the Yuval Ne'eman Workshop at Tel Aviv University and a global expert on drones and UAVs. However, Antebi emphasized the need for Israel's military to expedite the search for solutions for drone and UAV defense given the fact that Israel's enemies are catching up with UAV technology. Antebi said, 'The other side is improvising and achieving capabilities that were once exclusive to official nations, integrating them in ways that challenge our defense systems.' Antebi recommended, 'I would strengthen the country's protection and establish protocols for more immediate and frequent defense drills at all bases, as they are the main focus of the threat. We've seen firsthand what happens in these situations.'

Israel drops leaflets in Gaza with images of Sinwar’s body that s...	The flyers said,'Whoever drops the weapon and hands over the hostages will be allowed to leave and live in peace.' By Reuters and Algemeiner Staff Israeli planes dropped leaflets over southern Gaza on Saturday showing a picture of the dead Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar with the message that 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza,' echoing language used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The move came as Israeli military strikes killed at least 32 people across the Gaza Strip and tightened a siege around hospitals in Jabalia in the north of the enclave, Palestinian health officials said. 'Whoever drops the weapon and hands over the hostages will be allowed to leave and live in peace,' the leaflet, written in Arabic, read, according to residents of the southern city of Khan Younis and images circulating online. The leaflet’s wording was from a statement by Netanyahu on Thursday after Sinwar was killed by Israeli soldiers operating in Rafah, in the south near the Egyptian border, on Wednesday. In the central Gaza Strip camp of Al-Maghzai, an Israeli strike on a house killed 11 people, while another strike at the nearby camp of Nuseirat killed four others. Five other people were killed in two separate strikes in the south Gaza cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, medics said, while seven Palestinians were killed in the Shati camp in the northern Gaza Strip. EVACUATION ORDERS Residents and medics said Israeli forces had tightened their siege on Jabalia, the largest of the enclave’s eight historic camps, which it encircled by also sending tanks to nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and issuing evacuation orders to residents. Israeli officials said evacuation orders were aimed at separating Hamas fighters from civilians and denied that there was any systematic plan to clear civilians out of Jabalia or other northern areas.

Hezbollah drone hits building near Netanyahu’s home; no injuries ...	The Prime Minister and his wife were not home when the incident occurred. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Saturday, a Hezbollah drone targeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea. Although a nearby building was struck, there were no reported injuries. The Prime Minister and his wife were not home when the incident occurred. An announcement from the Prime Minister's office stated that 'a building had been hit' in the central coastal town known for its Roman ruins and amphitheater. Netanyahu released a statement on Saturday evening, 'The agents of Iran who tried to assassinate me and my wife today made a bitter mistake.' He remained firm that attempts on his life would not deter him from continuing to execute the war and added that anyone who harms Israelis 'will pay a heavy price.' 'We will continue to eliminate your terrorists, we will return our hostages from Gaza, we will return our residents in the north,' he continued. There is no indication if the Prime Minister's residence was damaged in the attack. Three drones were targeted at the home, and two of the three were shot down, with a third hitting a nearby building. Axios reports that this is the first time since the beginning of the war 'that a target affiliated directly with Netanyahu has been hit.' Israel's military is investigating several problems with its warning system since there were no alarms sounded in Caesarea prior to the drone making impact. Although attack helicopters were close to the scene, they were searching for drones further north. There were sirens heard in Glilot north of Tel Aviv, the location of a major IDF intelligence base and the Mossad headquarters, but there were no alerts on the Home Front Command app or similar platforms. The presence of the drones and the interceptions triggered alarms across central Israel's coast on Saturday. A resident of Caesarea told Channel 12 he heard helicopters and was worried that there was an incident, but since there were no sirens, he was not worried at first. He continued, 'Suddenly, a large explosion was heard, and it was not clear to us if it was from an interception or a drone impact — but it was clear that it was a real incident with no prior warning.' 'It was very worrying; luckily, there are no casualties,' he said.

Gaza-based CBS producer asks, ‘Are Jews human?’	Marwan Al-Ghoul has 'liked' various comments on social media that refer to Jews as 'Nazis' and 'murderers.' By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner A Gaza-based producer for CBS News praised by higher-ups for his 'resolve' has a history of denigrating Israel on social media, calling into question the publication’s potential bias against the Jewish state amid uproar over recent treatment of Jewish anchor Tony Dokoupil. According to social media posts unearthed by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting & Analysis (CAMERA), Marwan Al-Ghoul has 'liked' various comments on social media that refer to Jews as 'Nazis' and 'murderers.' He has also penned lengthy screeds on social media which gush about the potential 'demise' of the United States and Europe. In 2022, Al-Ghoul 'liked' a Facebook comment claiming Israeli Jews 'are Nazi Zionist murderers whose crimes are silenced, covered for by the US and international complicity. The date of holding them accountable will reach them one day and our children do not forget.' That same year, the CBS News producer 'liked' a Facebook comment about Israeli Jews that read, 'By no means do they count as human, these are monsters in a human body.' In 2017, as Hamas fired rockets at Israel in response to the US recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, Al-Ghoul wrote that Gaza’s civilians should join the 'permanent resistance' against the Jewish state. In 2018, he wrote that 'there is no doubt that the United States of America is the greatest empire in the world and because Israel is its offspring and industry, it will not be able to breathe even one day if the American empire is gone. And because it is the year of God in his creation, America and Israel are about to go down, but when?' In May 2022, Al-Ghoul openly questioned, 'Are the Jews human like us?' CBS has recently received criticism over its treatment of Jewish anchor Tony Dokoupil, arguing that his tough on-air questions directed at Ta-Nehisi Coates regarding his new book, The Message, were biased and did not meet 'editorial standards.' Dokoupil directly challenged Coates’s assertions that the Jewish state was practicing 'apartheid' against Palestinians and claimed the writer excluded important context about Israel’s security concerns. Dokoupil’s pointed questioning of Coates drew outrage from CBS News staffers and the broader media landscape. Staffers demanded that the CBS brass punish Dokoupil for his supposedly 'biased' line of questioning against Coates. Dokoupil was subsequently dragged into a meeting with the outlet’s 'Race and Culture Unit' in which he was criticized for his tone, phrasing, and body language. With a brighter spotlight now on CBS over its coverage of Israel, Al-Ghoul’s previous social media commentary may call into question the accuracy and fairness of his work. Many journalists from the Palestinian territories have previously exhibited a consistent anti-Israel bias in their reporting, even parroting narratives from the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. According to a Jewish Insider report from earlier this year, one-third of the Palestinian journalists listed by the Committee to Protect Journalists as being killed in the war in Gaza were connected to terrorist groups. There is no evidence that Al-Ghoul has any such connection.

Iran’s UN Mission claims Sinwar ‘will become a model for youth in...	Sinwar spent much of the war hiding in Gaza tunnels and surrounded himself with hostages as human shields to protect himself against Israeli forces. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Saturday, the Iranian mission to the UN released a statement that the October 7th mastermind 'will become a role model for the youth and children who will follow his path towards the liberation of Palestine.' The statement continued, 'As long as occupation and aggression exist, resistance will endure, for the martyr remains alive and a source of inspiration.' On X, the Iranian mission said Sinwar was superior to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who was executed in 2006. They wrote,' When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed.' The Iranian mission continued, 'However when Muslims look up to Martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield—in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy—the spirit of resistance will be strengthened.' Contrary to the UN mission's statement, Sinwar spent much of the war hiding in Gaza tunnels and surrounded himself with hostages as human shields to protect himself against Israeli forces. Channel 12 reported that Sinwar had been hiding with the six hostages who were executed and then recovered by the IDF on Aug. 31. The hostages were identified as Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, Carmel Gat, 40, and Master Sgt. Ori Danino, 25. However, when Israeli troops killed Sinwar on Saturday, he was not surrounded by hostages but was reportedly in the process of fleeing to the north of Gaza. In a speech on Saturday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Gazans to reject Hamas and emphasized Sinwar's cowardice as he was fleeing potential assassination. Netanyahu said, 'Sinwar destroyed your lives. He told you he was a lion, but in practice, he hid in a dark tunnel and was eliminated when he fled in a panic from our soldiers.' Netanyahu continued, 'His elimination is an important milestone in the demise of the Hamas axis of evil.' Daniel Hagari, the IDF's spokesman, said his forces 'didn't know he was there, but we continued to operate.' The troops saw one Hamas terrorist who 'ran alone into one of the buildings.' A drone was sent into the building and showed Sinwar mortally wounded, sitting slumped forward in his chair and throwing a stick at the drone as a last-ditch effort to defend himself. He was reportedly identified by his teeth. Official confirmation will follow DNA identification.

2 wounded in Dead Sea terror attack	Terrorists wearing army uniform infiltrate into Israel from Jordan, open fire on Israelis near the Dead Sea, wounding at least two. By World Israel News Staff At least two people were wounded when terrorists opened fire near an Israeli moshav in the Dead Sea area Friday morning. Two terrorists opened fire in the Tamar Regional Council district south of the Dead Sea, less than two miles from the town of Neot HaKikar. Neot HaKikar's emergency response team opened fire on the terrorists, killing both of them. According to a preliminary investigation by the Israeli military, the terrorists were wearing army uniforms, and had infiltrated into Israel across the Jordanian border. The IDF has dispatched soldiers to the area and has launched searches of the vicinity for any other terrorists who may have infiltrated across the border, the army said. 'A short while ago, IDF soldiers identified a number of terrorists that crossed from Jordan into Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea,' an army spokesperson said Friday morning. 'IDF troops were dispatched to the scene and two terrorists who opened fire toward the troops were neutralized by the forces. The troops are conducting searches in the area.' 'Additional forces have been dispatched to reinforce the area and are conducting searches on the ground and air for an additional terrorist who likely fled the scene.' Emergency first responders were called to the scene to treat the wounded and evacuate them to a hospital. One of the victims is listed in moderate condition, the other in light condition.

Terror attack on Tel Aviv hostage protest thwarted	Jerusalem resident tied to Hamas planned shooting and bombing attacks, including on targeting Tel Aviv demonstrators demanding deal to secure release of hostages in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff A Hamas-aligned terrorist from eastern Jerusalem planned a series of shooting and bombing attacks, including on targeting Tel Aviv protesters demanding a hostage deal, Israel Police announced Friday. The terrorist, a 22-year-old Arab resident of the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, was arrested a month ago, as part of an investigation into his various terror plots, police said. According to police, the Shin Bet internal security agency initiated the investigation last month. The suspect drafted plans for a number of possible attacks, including one on a Tel Aviv hostage protest, along with plots to shoot IDF soldiers, and plans to plant bombs on a train in Tel Aviv. The terrorist's self-stated goal was 'To kill as many people as possible to avenge the people of Gaza and the terror group Hamas.' As part of his preparations, the terrorist wrote a will and opened a social media group called the 'Soldiers of God.' At the time of his arrest, the terrorist was preparing for his first attack - aimed at the weekly hostage protest in Tel Aviv. Other terrorist operatives in Judea and Samaria were slated to obtain firearms and bombs for the planned attacks, police said. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) lauded the officers responsible for the terrorist's arrest, and called on the Knesset to pass a pair of bills which would make it easier to deport the families of convicted terrorists and to execute terrorists found guilty of murder. 'I commend and praise the commanders and officers of the Jerusalem District [police] for thwarting the terrorist attack planned by a terrorist resident of east Jerusalem,' said Ben-Gvir. 'Along with the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza, we keep a close watch on terrorists within our midst. The Israel Police invest great efforts to prevent them in advance.' 'The Otzma Yehudit party will continue to fight terrorism with full force and enact laws such as the Deportation of Terrorists' Families Law, the Death Penalty for Terrorists Law, and other deterrence laws, until we eradicate and uproot terrorism from within.'

Who was Yahya Sinwar?	Best known as the chief of Hamas forces in Gaza and mastermind of the October 7th invasion, Yahya Sinwar was arguably the Islamist terror group's most radical leader. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who masterminded the October 7 attacks was killed in a chance encounter with Israeli soldiers in Rafah on Thursday. Born in 1962 in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in Gaza, Sinwar grew up in a family that originated from Al Majdal, near Ashkelon. He rose to prominence within Hamas from the group’s early days, co-founding its Majd unit, which targeted suspected collaborators with Israel. Throughout his life, Sinwar was arrested multiple times and ultimately sentenced to five life terms for killing 12 Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. During his imprisonment, Israeli doctors removed a tumor from Sinwar’s brain in 2007, saving his life. Sinwar’s fortunes changed in 2011 when he was among 1,027 security prisoners freed in the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange. In the following years, his influence in Hamas grew. He traveled to Iran to meet with Qassem Soleimani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, who coordinated the IRGC’s relationships with Iranian proxy terror groups. Sinwar, along with Salah Arouri were instrumental in bringing Hamas into Iran’s orbit. By 2017, Sinwar became Hamas’s leader in Gaza. Reports suggest that his decision-making was driven by concerns over Israel’s work on developing a laser-based air defense system. On October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked numerous Israeli communities near the Gaza border. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage. But if Sinwar expected a wider war with the direct involvement of Iran’s other proxy terror groups, he was disappointed. Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities on a daily basis, but never invaded the Galilee. Houthis attacked international shipping in the Red Sea, while numerous ballistic missiles and drones caused minimal damage. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, and Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah was killed in a Beirut airstrike. And Iranian missile barrages in April and October failed to cause significant damage to Israel. Israel made repeated attempts to target Sinwar. After a prisoner exchange in November, Sinwar rejected further negotiations unless Israeli guaranteed an end to the war. Although he became Hamas supreme leader after Haniyeh’s death, he clashed with Hamas’s Qatar-based international leadership, barring them from engaging in any activities concerning Gaza’s post-war future, including talks with the Palestinian Authority. With Israel’s elimination of other Hamas leaders in the past year, Sinwar’s brother Mohammed, is now viewed as the only senior Hamas figure leader remaining in Gaza.

Israel bolstering border security on Syrian frontier	IDF troops are clearing land mines and establishing new barriers in the frontier region. By JNS Israeli forces have accelerated work on enhancing defensive measures near the Syrian border in the Golan Heights in recent weeks, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing security sources and analysts. Troops have cleared land mines and established new barriers on the frontier between the area in the far northeast of Israel and the demilitarized strip bordering Syria, according to the report. The move suggests Jerusalem could be looking to hit Hezbollah for the first time further east along its border with Lebanon, while establishing a secure zone from which IDF soldiers can monitor the Iranian-backed terrorist army and prevent infiltration into Israel, sources told the news agency. The work at the Syrian border could also represent a bolstering of Israeli actions to prevent weapons-smuggling from Iran to Hezbollah via Syrian territory. Reuters, citing a Syrian soldier stationed in south Syria, a Lebanese security official and a U.N. peacekeeping official, revealed that in addition to the previously reported demining activities, Israel was 'moving the fence separating the DMZ [demilitarized zone] towards the Syrian side and digging more fortifications in the area.' The sources said that Israeli tanks had at times briefly entered Syrian territory east of the U.N.-monitored buffer zone to provide security for bulldozers setting up what appears to be a new security fence in the demilitarized area. The Syrian soldier said it appeared that Israel was establishing a 'buffer zone' in the demilitarized area. A second Lebanese security source said that Israel dug a trench near the DMZ in October. This increased activity at the Syria-Golan border zone began in early October, around the same time that an Israeli ground operation to root out Hezbollah terrorism in Southern Lebanon began. Israel has also ramped up its alleged strikes on Syria during this period, according to the report. Reuters also reported that Russian troops left the Tal Hara outpost, a strategic overlook point. 'The Russians had left because of understandings with the Israelis to prevent a clash, a Syrian military officer said,' according to the article. A Syrian army officer said on Tuesday morning that Syrian army commanders ordered Syrian paramilitary groups to withdraw from the southern Quneitra area within 24 hours. Two sources also said that Iraqi militias backed by Iran had also been ordered to move away from the Quneitra countryside after Israeli tanks were spotted in the zone. The Iraqi fighters were told not to engage with Israeli forces directly. Israel’s military said it 'does not comment on operational plans' and it 'is currently fighting against the terrorist organization Hezbollah in order to allow for the safe return of northern residents to their homes,' in response to a Reuters question about the demining operation.

Former KKK leader David Duke endorses Jill Stein for president	Citing her opposition to Israel, ex-KKK grand wizard David Duke endorses the far-left Green Party's Jewish candidate, Jill Stein, for president. By Jackie Hajdenberg, JTA David Duke, the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, endorsed Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who is Jewish, on his radio show Tuesday. Duke, long one of the country’s highest-profile white supremacists and antisemites, has repeatedly sought political office while spreading conspiracy theories about Jews. In his endorsement of Stein, he said that she was the candidate with the strongest stance against 'Jewish power' because she opposed Israel’s military campaign. 'Although Dr. Stein and I obviously have our differences on important issues, she’s the only candidate who speaks clearly against the war in the Middle East and Ukraine,' Duke said on his radio show. 'By opposing Jewish supremacy in Israel and Jewish mass murder in Israel, and the policies of the American government in these insane wars and the Ukrainian war there, she’s actually doing something which is harming this Jewish power.' Duke is an unlikely supporter of Stein, who in addition to being Jewish is a far-left candidate. Duke, a fixture of the far-right, previously endorsed Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. On his show, Duke claimed that Trump had since lost his support due to a 'full-throated subservience to Israel and to the Jewish lobby in the United States' and 'on a global level.' But in endorsing Stein, Duke is still backing a candidate who could help return Trump to the White House. Stein’s bid for president is widely viewed as having a potential spoiler effect on the Harris-Walz campaign, taking enough votes away from the Democratic ticket in crucial swing states to throw them to the Republican nominee. At a recent rally, a Stein surrogate said the ticket couldn’t win, but could 'deny Kamala Harris the state of Michigan.' Stein’s campaign immediately disavowed the endorsement, which it painted as insincere. 'A racist troll has ‘endorsed’ our campaign to draw attention to himself, and certain smear merchants are happy to platform this troll to attack us,' Stein said in a statement. 'Of course, I reject any ‘endorsement’ from a white supremacist like David Duke, unlike Kamala Harris who can’t stop bragging about her endorsement from white supremacist mass murderer Dick Cheney.' (Cheney, Republican George W. Bush’s vice president, announced last month that he would vote for Harris because he believed Trump 'can never be trusted with power again.' Stein contends that the Bush administration’s war in Iraq amounted to mass murder.) Duke has made repeated political forays of his own over the decades, at certain points drawing national attention. He is a former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, campaigned for U.S. president as a Democrat in 1988, and advanced to the runoff in the 1991 election for governor of Louisiana, which he lost by a wide margin. He has since mounted other unsuccessful runs for office. And this is not the first time Duke has endorsed or praised a Democrat while citing their antipathy toward Jews or Israel. In 2019, he praised Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar amid controversy over tweets she wrote that drew accusations of antisemitism and for which she apologized. Weeks earlier, he endorsed then-Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, saying she would 'actually put America First rather than Israel First!' Whether or not Duke actually has enough of a following to sway any voters to Stein, supporters of Harris are using the endorsement to attack the Green Party candidate. 'Just because you disavow KKK grand wizard David Duke’s endorsement doesn’t mean it’s not concerning and you didn’t earn it,' tweeted Keith Edwards, a Democratic campaign strategist.

Netanyahu to Gazans after Sinwar’s Death: ‘Lay down your arms and...	Netanyahu to critics of Israel:'This is why we insisted on entering &#8230; Rafah where Sinwar and many of the murderers hid.' By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, following the news of the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Saturday, urged Gazan civilians to abandon Hamas, put down their arms and release hostages. He said that any Gazans holding hostages will be spared if they lay down their weapons and release captives. 'And at the same time I say, whoever harms our hostages, his blood will be on his head,' said Netanyahu. ' We will come to a reckoning with him.' He added, 'Sinwar destroyed your lives. He told you he was a lion, but in practice, he hid in a dark tunnel and was eliminated when he fled in a panic from our soldiers.' Netanyahu continued, 'His elimination is an important milestone in the demise of the Hamas axis of evil.' 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza,' Netanyahu explained. 'This is the beginning of the day after Hamas, and this is an opportunity for you, the residents of Gaza, to finally break free from its tyranny.' 'To the Hamas terrorists I say: your leaders are fleeing and they will be eliminated.' Netanyahu said. Addressing families of hostages, Netanyahu said, 'This is an important moment in the war. We will continue with full force until all your loved ones — our loved ones — are returned home. That is our supreme obligation. That is my supreme obligation.' To critics of Israel's military policies, Netanyahu said this is 'why we insisted, in the face of all the pressures, to enter Rafah, the fortified stronghold of Hamas where Sinwar and many of the murderers hid.' IDF soldiers killed Hamas terror master Yahya Sinwar in a firefight in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, Israeli sources close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters on Thursday.

Eight soldiers were wounded in Southern Lebanon on Wednesday and Thursday, while another sustained wounds in Gaza, the military added. On Monday night, the IDF announced that Sgt. Koren Bitan, 19, was killed while fighting Hamas terrorists in the southern Gaza Strip. One day prior, Hezbollah terrorists killed four soldiers in a drone strike on an IDF Golani Brigade training base near Binyamina. The IDF identified them as Sgt. Omri Tamari, 19, from Mazkeret Batya; Sgt. Yosef Hieb, 19, from Tuba-Zangariyye; Sgt. Yoav Agmon, 19, from Binyamina-Giv’at Ada; and Sgt. Alon Amitay, 19, from Ramot Naftali. On Oct. 11, an IDF soldier was killed in southern Gaza. Staff Sgt. Ittai Fogel, 22, served as a tank commander in the 46th Armored Battalion of the IDF’s 401st 'Iron Tracks' Brigade. He was from Yakir in Samaria. On Oct. 10, three reservists were killed and two others seriously injured when their vehicle hit an explosive in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza.

Sinwar’s death highlights the futility ceasefire concessions	Ceasefire periods allowed Hamas to rebuild infrastructure, enhance arsenals, and plan future attacks, prolonging the conflict and escalating the threat. By Gregg Roman, Middle East Forum The death of Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of the October 7, 2023, massacre and head of Hamas’s political bureau, marks a turning point in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli forces eliminated Sinwar, who had orchestrated Hamas’s insurgency in Gaza since his 2011 release from prison during the Gilad Shalit prisoner swap. Sinwar’s removal disrupts Hamas’s leadership and raises critical questions about the effectiveness of past ceasefire demands and concessions. Ceasefires aim to halt violence and open paths to dialogue. Yet militant groups like Hamas have exploited these pauses to regroup, rearm, and strengthen their positions. Sinwar’s rise exemplified how concessions can empower those committed to violence. Ceasefire periods allowed Hamas to rebuild infrastructure, enhance arsenals, and plan future attacks, prolonging the conflict and escalating the threat. Reliance on ceasefires without dismantling the foundations of militancy creates a false sense of security. These temporary measures offer immediate relief but fail to produce lasting peace. Sinwar’s resurgence after 2011 underscores the risks associated with ceasefires lacking stringent enforcement and verification. They interfere with strategic objectives like dismantling terrorist networks by granting groups time and space to recover and prepare for further aggression. The elimination of Sinwar mirrors the fates of other high-profile militant leaders. The deaths of figures like Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, Iraq’s insurgent leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin, and master bombmaker Yahya Ayyash disrupted their organizations but did not end the threats they posed. Bin Laden’s death dealt a blow to Al-Qaeda but led to decentralization and the rise of new factions. Yassin’s assassination led to short-term escalations before weakening Hamas’s leadership structure. These cases show that removing key leaders must be part of a broader strategy addressing the ideological and operational foundations of these groups. Targeted killings alone can lead to unintended consequences, such as the emergence of more radical elements or the continuation of violence. Sinwar once quoted Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (r. 632-661 CE): 'There are two days in human life, a day when death is not your destiny, and a day when death is your destiny. I am not afraid of the first day because death is not my destiny, so no one can harm me. I am not afraid of the second day either, because if it is my destiny, I cannot prevent it.' His fatalistic confidence proved misplaced. Decisive action can reach even those who consider themselves untouchable. Sinwar’s death calls for a critical reassessment of repeated ceasefire demands. Ceasefires should not be ends in themselves but tools managed carefully to prevent exploitation by militant groups. The tactical advantages gained during ceasefires—regrouping, rearming, and spreading ideology—undermine long-term peace efforts. Engaging in ceasefires can inadvertently legitimize these groups as political actors, eroding public trust in governmental strategies. Ensuring compliance from decentralized militant organizations is challenging, leading to breaches that reignite hostilities. The current moment offers an opportunity to rethink conflict approaches. A comprehensive strategy should combine sustained security measures with diplomatic efforts addressing the political, economic, and social factors fueling militancy. Preventing tactical exploitation requires robust monitoring and enforcement during any ceasefire. Avoiding actions that legitimize terrorist organizations while promoting legitimate political processes is essential. Transparent communication about security measures’ goals and outcomes can maintain public trust. International collaboration is vital to apply consistent pressure on militant groups and support initiatives addressing the conflict’s root causes. Ultimately, ending an organization like Hamas requires decapitating its leadership, not negotiating with those who orchestrate massacres. Convincing the rank-and-file that their war goals are unattainable leads them to consider surrender or disarmament. Sinwar’s fate demonstrates that decisive action can overcome fatalistic beliefs and disrupt militant operations. Continuing to rely on ceasefires without achieving core objectives only prolongs the cycle of violence. Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that ceasefires, when they enable enemies to regroup rather than secure peace, are not just ineffective—they are a dangerous illusion that delay victory and cost lives.

Israeli sources: Hamas chief and Oct 7th mastermind, Yahya Sinwar...	The Israel Police positively identified the corpse of Sinwar, who was killed on Wednesday. By Charles Bybelezer, Amelie Botbol, JNS IDF soldiers killed Hamas terror master Yahya Sinwar in a firefight in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, Israeli sources close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters on Thursday. The Israel Police positively identified the corpse of Sinwar, who was killed on Wednesday, several channels and news sites subsequently reported. He was reportedly identified by his teeth. Official confirmation will follow DNA identification. Reuters cited Hamas sources as saying that all indications suggest the terror master had been killed. Netanyahu was set to address the nation at 8:30 p.m. local time.

Photo by Mahmud Hams/AFP via Getty Images. The Israel Defense Forces said earlier Thursday that it was investigating whether Sinwar was one of three terrorists killed by Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian enclave. According to initial reports, the Hamas leader was killed by tank fire called in by IDF soldiers who had identified armed terrorists in a building. When the soldiers subsequently searched the premises, they discovered that one of the bodies bore a striking resemblance to Sinwar. 'We will reach every terrorist and eliminate them,' Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant tweeted on Thursday. 'You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you by the sword,' added Gallant, quoting Leviticus 26:7. The X post included pictures of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated in an IDF strike in Beirut last month, and former Hamas 'military'/Al-Qassam Brigades chief Mohammed Deif, who was killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza’s Khan Yunis in July. Later on Thursday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) head Ronen Bar held a situation assessment. Shin Bet head Ronen Bar (left) and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi hold a situation assessment, Oct. 17, 2024. Credit: Israel Defense Forces. The military said on Thursday that while no hostages were found in the building where the three terrorists were killed, 'forces continue to operate with the necessary caution in the area.' Netanyahu instructed the IDF to inform hostage families that there was no indication any hostages were hurt during the battle. Efrat Machikawa, the niece of captive Gadi Moses, told JNS on Thursday, 'I hope all Israelis including the government will remain modest and humble. While this is a military achievement, the most important thing remains saving lives, and by that I mean returning the hostages.' While the Hamas leader’s elimination is 'very important, I remain extremely concerned about [the hostages’] fate. They are in my head and my heart every second since Oct. 7. They are the only ones I think about,' Machikawa added. Opposition leader Yair Lapid called on the Netanyahu government to 'take advantage of the opportunity for a decisive move regarding the hostages. 'Strive for a comprehensive deal and offer monetary rewards and safe passage to anyone who brings captives to our forces,' he tweeted. Qatari officials involved in indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas have told family members of hostages that Sinwar had surrounded himself with captives. Channel 12 reported that Sinwar had been hiding with the six hostages who were executed and then recovered by the IDF on Aug. 31. The hostages were identified as Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, Carmel Gat, 40, and Master Sgt. Ori Danino, 25. Hamas still holds 101 hostages, including 97 of the 251 taken during the Palestinian terror group’s massacre of some 1,200 people in the northwestern Negev just over a year ago. 'We need to thank the IDF if Sinwar is indeed dead. It also means that there is a lot of anxiety regarding the fate of the 101 hostages,' Ruby Chen, the father of captive Itay Chen, told JNS on Thursday. 'Now is the time to leverage this military action for a deal to get them out. 'We received an update from IDF sources confirming that there were no hostages in the vicinity with regards to the incident,' he continued. 'My message is that now is the time to get a deal done and put an end to all of this.'

Earlier this month, Sinwar reportedly renewed contacts with mediators in Qatar to find out the chances that he could receive immunity in any ceasefire-for-hostages-and-terrorists-release deal. Similarly, in August, Ynet reported that Sinwar wanted protection against the possibility of an Israeli assassination. 'Sinwar insists on guarantees for his safety and life' a senior Egyptian official said. Two threats from Qatar led to Sinwar’s emergence from a long silence, according to Channel 12. Sinwar was convicted on multiple murder counts by an Israeli court and sentenced to five life sentences, which he was supposed to serve until his death. However, in October 2011, he was released from prison—having served 22 years—as part of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange. Following his release, Sinwar gained power and popularity within Hamas, becoming its Gaza leader in 2017 by defeating Ismail Haniyeh in a vote. In August, Sinwar was chosen to lead Hamas’s so-called political bureau, replacing Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran on July 31.
