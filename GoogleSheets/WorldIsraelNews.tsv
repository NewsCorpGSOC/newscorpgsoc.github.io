IAF on ‘highest alert level’ for Houthi missiles, drones	The Houthis have claimed that their aggression against Israel is in solidarity with Gaza, as negotiations between Hamas and the Jewish State have stalled. By World Israel News Staff Israel is preparing for renewed missile fire from the Yemen-based Houthis, after intensive US strikes on the terror group and repeated threats from Houthi officials. According to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Mako, the Israeli Air Force has raised its level of alert to the highest possible tier, following the explosion of a Houthi missile - which may have been aimed at Israel - in Egypt's Sinai Desert on Sunday. The missile impacted near Sharm el-Sheikh, some 224 kilometers (130 miles) from Israel's southern border with Egypt. Since October 2023, the Houthis fired dozens of explosive drones and missiles at the Jewish State. Many of those attacks appeared to deliberately target civilian infrastructure, with missiles destroying an elementary school in Ramat Gan and a park in southern Tel Aviv. While only one Israeli was killed in the attacks, the aerial assaults sent millions of Israelis scrambling for bomb shelters, often in the middle of the night. Houthi leaders recently said they would resume attacks on Israel-linked ships and did not rule out the possibility of firing at Israel, after the Jewish State stopped humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip. The Houthis have claimed that their aggression against Israel is in solidarity with Gaza, as negotiations between Hamas and the Jewish State have stalled. Citing hundreds of Houthi missile and drone attacks on American ships, including naval vessels, since October 2023, President Donald Trump launched a series of strikes on the Houthi stronghold of Sana'aa on Saturday evening. The Houthis called the bombings a 'war crime,' claiming that dozens were killed and vowing revenge. On Sunday, the Houthis launched at least 11 explosive drones at the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea. Trump administration officials told Reuters that the drones were shot down well before they posed a threat to the ship. A Houthi spokesman said the group had launched another barrage of drones at the Truman on Sunday morning, pledging to continue their attacks until the Israeli 'siege' of Gaza is lifted.

Netanyahu moves to fire Shin Bet head, citing deepening distrust	I have ongoing distrust in the head of the Shin Bet, which was grown over time,' Netanyahu said in video announcing Ronen Bar's firing. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his intention to dismiss Shin Bet head Ronen Bar, citing ongoing distrust between the two men that is hindering their ability to work together. In a video statement released on Sunday evening, Netanyahu praised Shin Bet employees and staff, saying that Bar's firing is not a criticism of their work. But Netanyahu made it clear that his longstanding issues with Bar have made it impossible for the security chief to continue in his role. 'At all times, but especially during an existential war such as the one we face, there must be full trust between the prime minister and the head of the Shin Bet,' Netanyahu said in the video, which was published shortly after a face-to-face meeting with Bar. 'But unfortunately, the situation is the opposite — I do not have such trust,' the premier continued. 'I have ongoing distrust in the head of the Shin Bet, a distrust that has grown over time.' Netanyahu added that he is 'sure that this step is critical for the rehabilitation of the agency, for achieving all our war aims, and for preventing the next disaster.' The move comes shortly after Bar's predecessor, ex-Shin Bet head Nadav Argaman, said in a TV interview that he would publicly release compromising information about Netanyahu, should the prime minister commit acts that he deemed in violation of the law. Netanyahu immediately filed a police report against Argaman for blackmail, and police are currently investigating the former security leader over his remarks. Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara claimed in a media statement that Netanyahu does not have the legal authority to fire Bar, an allegation that was challenged by Justice Minister Yariv Levin. Barahav-Miara reportedly told Netanyahu in a letter that he is not permitte dto 'initiate a dismissal process' of Bar 'until the factual and legal basis underlying your decision is fully examined, as well as your authority to address the matter at this time.' Levin responded with a media statement, noting that 'the Shin Bet Law explicitly states that the government has the authority to terminate the service of the head of the agency before the end of their term.' The minister added that Barahav-Miara is likely aware of this law. 'In case anyone is confused, Israel is a democracy, and everyone in it, including the attorney general, is subject to the law,' Levin said. He said that it is critical for the government 'not surrender to threats or attempts to strip [it] of its authority.'

Far-left MK: Netanyahu has declared war on Israel	Coalition MK praises move to fire Ronen Bar, tweeting 'this is how you defeat the Deep State.' By World Israel News Staff Far-left MK Yair Golan of the Democrats party has slammed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his decision to fire Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, saying that the move is equivalent to a 'declaration of war' against the state of Israel. Golan, who has long been a vocal opponent of the premier, added that he will lead 'tremendous resistance' aimed at preventing Netanyahu from removing Bar from office. His sentiments were echoed by fellow opposition MK and Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid, who said in a media statement that the decision to fire Bar was due to alleged ties between Netanyahu's staff and Qatar. The Shin Bet is currently investigating contacts between Netanyahu's aides and the Gulf Kingdom, but Lapid did not provide evidence for his allegations that the probe had motivated Netanyahu to fire Bar. National Unity party chairman Benny Gantz said that Bar's termination is 'a direct blow to the security of the state and the dismantling of unity in Israeli society for political and personal reasons.' Coalition politicians applauded the move to fire Bar, with MK Avi Maoz of the Noam party tweeting 'this is what democracy looks like. This is how you defeat the Deep State.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionism) called the move 'a necessary step,' writing on X that Bar should have stepped down shortly after the October 7th massacres. 'This is something I have been demanding for a long time – better late than never. There is no place in a democratic country for officials who act politically against elected leaders,' Otzma Yehudit head and former National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir tweeted. He added that Israel's right-wing parties must 'learn from President Trump to eradicate the Deep State.' With Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara claiming that Bar cannot be dismissed without approval from her office, the timeline for Bar's departure from office remains unclear.

Ex-IDF chief: ‘I have no choice but to give credit to Hamas for i...	Halevi announced his resignation on Jan. 21, accepting responsibility for the IDF’s failure and saying it would 'stay with me for the rest of my life.' By JNS Former IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. (res.) Herzi Halevi, who stepped down on March 5, said in a recording broadcast by Israel’s Army Radio on Sunday that he had no choice but to 'credit' Hamas for 'the deception it perpetrated on us.' Hamas engaged in a number of deceptions to put Israel to sleep in order to prepare its October 2023 attack, Halevi said. 'They tricked us and it worked.' 'In all the training and all the discussions we carried out, we never contemplated the possibility that 5% of what happened could happen,' he said. The Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led invasion took Israel completely by surprise, resulting in the loss of some 1,200 lives, mostly civilians, and the kidnapping of 251 people. It took the IDF hours to mount an effective response. In a Feb. 28 meeting with heads of regional councils in southern Israel to present the military’s internal findings regarding the Oct. 7 massacre, Halevi said, 'I want you to know that many people who were murdered [on Oct. 7]—their last words were, ‘Where’s the IDF?’ I know this, and it is very, very difficult for us.' Of the broader failings of the IDF, Halevi said that before the attack, the military viewed Hamas as a 'limited' military force incapable of launching a large-scale surprise attack. The military’s posture toward Gaza had been reliant on intelligence, he said. Israel’s Channel 12 reported that for the past 15 years, the Military Intelligence Directorate has had no human intelligence sources within Gaza and that the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) had no active intelligence sources in the Strip. The military released on Feb. 27 the findings of its internal probes into the failures leading up to and during the Hamas-led cross-border terrorist attacks. 'It is wrong to ‘manage’ a conflict with an enemy whose goal is your destruction,' the military investigation stated, concluding that Hamas terrorists 'took advantage of Israel’s policy of ‘conflict management’ to advance an orderly plan for a broad attack.' Halevi announced his resignation on Jan. 21, accepting responsibility for the IDF’s failure and saying it would 'stay with me for the rest of my life.' In his final speech as chief of staff on March 5, Halevi called for an investigation to learn from the army’s mistakes and ensure its strength in the future. Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir has replaced Halevi. 'Hamas has not yet been defeated,' Zamir said at his induction ceremony at IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv. Zamir served as deputy chief of staff (2018-2021). Before that, he led the IDF Southern Command (2015-18).

Fundraiser for freed Hamas hostage Yarden Bibas reaches over $1.4...	The final amount is expected to far surpass the original goal of 5 million shekels (US$1.371.086). By Kostis Konstantinou, TPS A fundraising campaign for Hamas captivity survivor Yarden Bibas has raised over $1.4 million in less than 24 hours. The campaign was launched by Eli Bibas, to help his son Yarden, 35, rebuild his life after he survived 16 months in horrific captivity. Yarden’s wife Shiri, 32, and two baby sons Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 10 months, were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists after just one month of being held in Gaza. Yarden only learned of their deaths upon his release on February 1. The young family were snatched from their home in the Nir Oz Kibbutz, close to the Israeli border, on October 7 2023, after terrorists from the Gaza strip infiltrated and attacked Israel. The fundraiser was shared online at 19:30 IST on Saturday and within hours, the amount skyrocketed due to the generosity of donations from both within Israel and globally. The final amount is expected to far surpass the original goal of 5 million shekels (US$1.371.086). Eli Bibas wrote on the page: 'For 484 days, Yarden waited for the moment he would be freed and finally return to life and embrace his family again. Almost 500 days in Hamas captivity – each minute there felt like an eternity. 'More than anything, he longed to see Shiri again, hold Ariel, and lift Kfir, his baby, into his arms. But instead of reuniting with them, he was released into a cruel and heartbreaking reality – the worst nightmare imaginable. 'Only after his release did Yarden learn the devastating truth – his entire world had been murdered in captivity. He lost his family, his home, his belongings – he lost everything. And now, we are here to help him rebuild from the ashes. 'Yarden’s recovery is a long, complex, and painful journey. Beyond the unbearable grief, he must rebuild his life from nothing physically, emotionally, and financially. He has no home, no stability – and each day brings new, unexpected challenges. 'He needs professional support, mental health assistance, and financial resources to gradually regain a sense of normalcy and one day, he hopes to fulfill his dream – to establish a memorial for Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir.' Moshe Minaker, a spokesperson for US-based Lehosheet Yad, the charity that helped the campaign, told TPS-IL: 'The overwhelming support from people worldwide has been incredible and we are confident that we will reach our goal in the coming hours.' At the beginning of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, the charity launched an ongoing project called 'Returning to Life' to assist all the children and families who returned from Hamas captivity. The bodies of Kfir, Ariel, and Shiri were returned to Israel last month as part of the fragile hostage deal between the terror group and Israel. In further insult to their memory, Hamas did not initially return the body of Shiri, instead handing over the body of an unidentified woman. The terror group claimed it was a mistake before returning Shiri’s body the next day. An Israeli inspection of the corpses concluded the infants had been strangled with bare hands and Shiri had been 'brutally murdered' and shot. All three were laid to rest in a single cask together, next to Shiri’s parents Yossi and Margit Silberman, who were also murdered by Hamas on the same day that the Bibas family were taken into Gaza. The funeral of Shiri and her two sons was attended by thousands of mourning Israelis who lined the streets in emotional scenes, as the family was laid to rest at a cemetery in Southern Israel, close to the kibbutz where they’d lived. At least 1,180 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7 2023. Of the 59 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

Eight orphaned children honor their father’s IDF service on Purim	This Purim, Rabbi Goldberg’s children found a powerful way to honor their father by dressing as 'Tzav 8' recruits. By Jewish Breaking News Rabbi Avi Goldberg made an everlasting impact during his tenure at Jerusalem’s Himmelfarb High School for Boys. A gifted clarinetist who became a beloved educator and spiritual leader, Rabbi Avi Goldberg lived with remarkable purpose until his fall in battle in Lebanon on October 26, 2024. Rabbi Goldberg taught with passion at his alma mater, and connected effortlessly with Jews across the religious spectrum during his earlier years as an emissary in Memphis. When war broke out on Oct. 7, 2023, he spent 250 days on the front lines while still finding ways to bring Torah and tradition to his fellow soldiers by organizing Daf Yomi study and even Tu BiShvat plantings. This Purim, Rabbi Goldberg’s children found a powerful way to honor their father by dressing as 'Tzav 8' recruits. In Israel, this emergency draft notice calls citizens to military duty during times of national crisis. 'The children had the idea of dressing up as Tzav 8 and they refused to miss out on the festivities and joy of the Purim holiday. We have our own family draft order and that is to choose life anew every single morning,' Rebbetzin Rachel Goldberg tells Arutz Sheva Though Rabbi Goldberg could have legitimately avoided service as both a father of eight and a man over 40, he responded to his own summons with characteristic selflessness by insisting on serving where he was needed most.

Teenage-designed space satellites may help enable Mars travel	As well as collecting research, the satellites will telemetrically transmit the names of all Israeli civilians and soldiers killed from October 7, 2023, to December 2024, meaning they will be displayed continuously on the Israel Space Agency website. By Crystal Jones, TPS The largest ever Israeli group satellite constellation – created in Israel by high school students – was launched into space today – and may help humans travel to nearby planet Mars in the future. Nine intricate nanosatellites were launched from a base in the US after students in Israel spent three years building the equipment as part of a nationwide project. Each satellite measures 10×10×11.3 cm – a little bigger than the size of a golf ball – and was launched into the Earth’s orbit at 500 kilometers aboard a space rocket. Once released, the objects will travel at a speed of five miles per second and collect vital information on cosmic radiation. The scientifically advanced equipment will stay in orbit for three years, and will be useful in determining whether or not humans may one day be able to travel to Mars, as well as collect information on the effects of electronic radiation. The pieces were all designed as well as made by the students, and overseen by scientists at the university. Professor Meir Ariel, Head of the Space Engineering Center at Tel Aviv University’s Faculty of Engineering told TPS-IL: 'We find this age [15-18 year olds] can be very good at writing software and have proven in the past that they are up to the job. 'The satellites will monitor cosmic radiation from the sun and from the supernova explosion, which is harmful to electronic devices and humans. If we want to travel to Mars, we need to understand that.' Each miniature space capsule contains transmitters that will send information back to space bases on Earth for scientists to analyze. The satellites mark the 20th made and released into orbit by Israeli high school students. Many more have been made by adult working Israeli scientists, but Israel often draw on it’s youth in scientific programs, in order to encourage scientific innovation. Because the satellites needed to be released in an Eastward direction to maximize velocity, Israel paid a company to release them from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Israel is not able to do so from it’s own land, because of hostile neighboring countries. As well as collecting research, the satellites will telemetrically transmit the names of all Israeli civilians and soldiers killed from October 7, 2023, to December 2024, meaning they will be displayed continuously on the Israel Space Agency website. Gila Gamliel, Minister of Innovation, Science, and Technology commented: 'What these talented students have accomplished is nothing short of amazing – they have built the largest Israeli satellite constellation ever launched… 'Our substantial investment in this initiative is not just an investment in technology — it is an investment in you, the next generation of Israeli space scientists and engineers.' She also mentioned feeling ‘emotional’ at the achievement, and elation at seeing the first satellite created by a Druze community: 'I am especially proud of the first-ever Druze satellite and the moving memorial mission of the Sha’ar HaNegev satellite.' Brigadier General Uri Oron, Director General of the Israel Space Agency said: 'The Tevel 2 project is a testament to the power of Israeli innovation. 'We see here a winning combination of scientific excellence, technological education, and societal integration. These satellites will not only provide crucial scientific data; they will also serve as an inspiration for the next generation of Israeli space scientists.' The project cost 10.5 million shekels (approximately $2.88 million), was funded by Israel’s Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Technology, and was overseen by Tel Aviv University’s Space Engineering program.

United restarts flights to Israel	Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines had previously announced that it would renew service to Israel from New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in April. By JNS United Airlines resumed service to Israel this weekend, becoming the first U.S. carrier to return to Tel Aviv after interruptions due to the Israel-Hamas war. The Chicago-based legacy carrier restarted daily service to Israel from its hub at Newark’s Liberty International Airport on Saturday afternoon, while its daytime return flight to the U.S. departed from Ben-Gurion International Airport on Sunday morning. United will restore its second daily flight on March 29 with nighttime departure times. Before the war broke out, United offered the largest number of flights to Israel of any U.S. carrier, with 14 weekly flights from the New York area as well as service from Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. United said last month that it would resume additional flights to Israel based on demand. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines had previously announced that it would renew service to Israel from New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in April. Both airlines are resuming service to Tel Aviv ahead of the high-season Passover and Easter holidays next month, when flights to and from Israel are generally heavily booked. American Airlines has not announced when it plans to restart service to Israel. Israel’s Arkia Airlines is now offering thrice weekly flights to New York at a set price, while Israir plans to relaunch flights to the Big Apple in the future on a line it serviced last decade. The moves by United and Delta will effectively end the monopoly Israel’s flagship carrier El Al had on the lucrative transatlantic route through most of the 15-month war, which saw fares skyrocket amid charges of price gouging.

Israel and Azerbaijan to ink strategic energy agreement	For Israel, ties with Azerbaijan—which shares a 428-mile border with Iran, a country that is home to tens of millions of Azeris—are of strategic importance, both as a conduit for intelligence and because it supplies more than a third of the Jewish state’s oil. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS Israel and Azerbaijan will sign an agreement in Jerusalem on Monday granting the State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) a license for gas exploration in Israel, the Israeli Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure said on Sunday. The accord, which is expected to strengthen Israel’s energy security, is the latest sign of the friendly ties between the Jewish state and the predominantly Shi’ite Muslim country. The gas exploration deal will be signed during a visit to Israel by Azerbaijan’s Economy Minister Mikayil Jabbarov, who also serves as the chairman of SOCAR, in a ceremony with Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen at his office. SOCAR is part of a consortium including British multinational oil and gas firm BP and Israel’s NewMed Energy (formerly Delek Drilling) that won a tender from Israel’s Energy Ministry in 2023 to drill in Mediterranean fields adjacent to the country’s Leviathan field, one of the world’s largest offshore gas discoveries. Jabbarov, who is also expected to meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog and senior business leaders, is the first Azerbaijani minister to visit Israel since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led massacre in southern Israel, which triggered the 15-month war in Gaza and delayed the deal. The visit comes one month after Hikmet Hajiyev, the assistant to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and head of the Foreign Policy Affairs Department of the Presidential Administration, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his second such trip in the last three months. For Israel, ties with Azerbaijan—which shares a 428-mile border with Iran, a country that is home to tens of millions of Azeris—are of strategic importance, both as a conduit for intelligence and because it supplies more than a third of the Jewish state’s oil. At the same time, Azerbaijan is a leading purchaser of Israeli military hardware, which helped Baku in the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War against archrival Armenia in 2020. Two years ago, secular Azerbaijan made history when it became the first Shi’ite country to open an embassy in Israel, despite repeated violence and threats from neighboring Iran. The diplomatic landmark was the product of a three-decade-old covert and overt relationship rooted in a centuries-long affinity between the two nations, which has blossomed from a people-to-people relationship to a robust security- and energy-related focus.

Following US attack, Houthis fire missile towards Israel, lands i...	The White House announced that the US launched broad airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, which a US officla said could last days or weeks. By JNS and World Israel News The IDF confirmed that it had detected a missile launch from Yemen in the direction of Israel, but did not hit Israeli territory. This followed reports from local media stating that the Houthis had fired a projectile that struck in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, near the Red Sea resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh. The IDF clarified that it was not possible to determine the missile’s intended target. The missile was fired from Yemen after the United States attacked targets in Yemen on Saturday night. A US official said the attacks could last 'days or possibly weeks.' The Houthi-run health ministry claimed the US attacks killed at least 23 people and wounded at least 20 more. The White House announced that the US launched broad airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on Saturday night. 'To all Houthi terrorists, your time is up and your attacks must stop starting today. If they don’t, Hell will rain down upon you like nothing you have ever seen before,' US President Donald Trump said in a statement. On March 12, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis, threatened to resume attacks on 'any Israeli vessel' in nearby maritime routes. His threat came in response to Israel’s refusal to allow aid into Gaza. On Feb. 28, al-Houthi had issued a similar warning, saying that missile attacks against Tel Aviv would resume if Israel renewed its military actions against Hamas in Gaza. Since Hamas initiated the conflict with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, the Houthis have supported the terrorist group. They have fired more than 100 missile and drone attacks at merchant vessels, sinking two ships and killing four sailors. Additionally, they have fired more than 350 drones and missiles at Israel. The Houthis ceased their attacks with the start of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which took effect on Jan. 19. The 42-day Phase 1 of the truce expired on March 1. There are significant gaps in negotiations for Phase 2 of the truce, with Hamas rejecting a U.S. proposal to extend Phase 1 through Ramadan and Passover.

October 7th terrorist and terrorist freed in hostage deal among 6...	IDF airstrike in Gaza kills six terrorists, including one who participated in the invasion of October 7th, and an Islamic Jihad terrorist who was released in the recent hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Six terrorists were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip Saturday, after an Israeli warplane targeted a terrorist cell operating a drone from northern Gaza near the Israeli frontier. In the airstrike, the IDF struck a terrorist cell in the Beit Lahia area in northern Gaza, between Gaza City and the Israeli border. The six slain terrorists included a terrorist who infiltrated Israeli territory during the October 7th massacre, and a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group who was recently freed by Israel as part of the hostage deal. The targeted terrorists were operating a drone intended to facilitate terrorist activities against IDF forces operating in the Gaza Strip. Based on intelligence regarding terrorist activity in the area, it was determined that the drone was consistent with those used in the past by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist organization. On Sunday morning, the IDF identified the six slain terrorists as Mustafa Muhammad Shaaban Hamad, a Hamas terrorist who infiltrated Israeli territory during the October 7th massacre; Mahmoud Yahya Rashdi Al-Saraj, a Hamas engineering specialist; Bilal Mahmoud Fuad Abu Matar, a Hamas terrorist who operated under the guise of a photographer; Mahmoud Imad Hassan Aslim, a terrorist from Hamas' Zaytoun Battalion who operated under the guise of a journalist; Zuheib Basem Khaled Nagar, a Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist who was released as part of the latest hostage deal; and Muhammad Alaa Subhi Al-Jafir – a Hamas terrorist. Later on Sunday, IDF Forces killed two Hezbollah terrorists operating as lookouts in southern Lebanon, in the area of Yatar and Meiss el Jabal.

Qatar influence rewriting US school curricula to promote anti-Isr...	Pro-Hamas, Iranian-aligned Gulf state using its petro dollars to shape the curriculum used by thousands of American K-12 schools in all 50 states, report warns. By World Israel News Staff The Qatari government is using its funding of an American college where the curriculum for thousands of American K-12 schools is drafted to reshape the way school children in the U.S. are taught, injecting anti-Israel bias into primary and secondary school education, a recently published report warns. Last week, the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) published a report documenting the Qatari government’s extensive foreign influence and anti-Israel bias infiltrating U.S. K-12 classrooms through Brown University’s Choices Program. This curriculum, used by over 8,000 schools across all 50 states and reaching more than one million students, operates with undisclosed foreign funding and has been found to systematically distort historical facts to delegitimize Israel. The report also raises significant concerns about transparency, oversight, and compliance with federal disclosure laws. According to the ISGAP report, Qatari funding has led to a systematic manipulation of educational materials used by the Choices Program within the same units over the last decade, gradually shifting its curriculum to present an increasingly anti-Israel perspective. Changes include the removal of key historical documents and the omission of others, the misrepresentation of Israel’s capital in maps, and the exclusion of balanced perspectives on Israeli history and diplomacy. Furthermore, the report reveals that the Qatar Foundation International (QFI) has played an undisclosed role in shaping the Choices Program’s curriculum and teacher training, influencing how American students are taught about the Middle East and Israel. The report also highlights a critical lack of transparency and oversight in schools utilizing the Choices Program. Schools are not informed when curriculum content is modified, and the proprietary nature of the digital curriculum prevents parents, school boards, and educators from reviewing and assessing changes. This raises serious ethical and legal concerns regarding accountability in education. Republican Congressman Kevin Kiley from California, Chair of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education of the House Education & Workforce Committee, said that it appeared that 'foreign influence from Qatar has infiltrated the Choices Program hosted at Brown University, a curriculum widely adopted in K-12 schools across the country.' Kiley said he would work 'with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to assure foreign influence does not promote antisemitism at American schools.' The report also exposes the opaque legal and financial structure of the Choices Program, which operates under Brown University’s name while maintaining an ambiguous status that obscures compliance with federal disclosure laws. The authors of the report said they found substantial evidence suggesting that Brown University may have failed to disclose foreign funding as required under the Higher Education Act. Additionally, the report raises concerns about the potential exposure of student and teacher data to third-party entities. 'This is a direct attempt to manipulate American students by embedding ideologically motivated. foreign propaganda in their education,' Dr. Charles Asher Small, ISGAP’s Executive Director, said. 'Foreign entities with known ties to extremist ideologies should not be shaping how our children learn about history and the Middle East. The lack of transparency and oversight in this case is a threat to educational integrity and democratic values. American students should not be used as pawns in foreign propaganda campaigns. It is time to demand transparency, accountability, and an end to the silent manipulation of our children’s education.'

Arab-Israeli terrorist’s Ramadan shooting attack in Jerusalem’s O...	Police, Shin Bet nab Israeli Arab man and his brother who plotted to gun down Israeli police and Jewish civilians in the Old city of Jerusalem during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. By World Israel News Staff An Arab-Israeli terrorist who planned to gun down Israeli civilians and police officers at the entrance to the Old City of Jerusalem during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan was arrested recently, foiling his planned attack. According to a joint statement Sunday by the Shin Bet internal security agency and the Haifa District Police, the police department and Shin Bet arrested Uday Mobarsham in late February, ahead of Ramadan, which began on February 27th. As part of a joint operation between the Shin Bet and Israel Police, detectives and the police department’s Yassam special patrol unit, arrested Mobarsham, a resident of the town of Jadeidi-Makr in northern Israel, based on intelligence collected by the Shin Bet. After being taken into custody, Mobarsham was transferred to the Shin Bet for questioning.. During his interrogation by the Shin Bet and police, it was revealed that Mobarsham planned to carry out a shooting attack at the Damascus Gate in the Old City of Jerusalem against police officers and Jewish civilians during Ramadan using a pistol in his possession. Mobarsham said that his motive was to express solidarity with the Palestinian cause, particularly if Muslim prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque were restricted during Ramadan. The investigation also revealed that Mobarsham had purchased the firearm illegally, practiced shooting, and attempted to recruit others to assist in the attack. The pistol was later found in the possession of his brother, who was also arrested. Additional suspects believed to be part of the cell were located and taken into custody. After completing the investigation, the Shin Bet and police gathered sufficient evidence against the suspects for the Haifa District Attorney’s Office to file indictments against Mobarsham and his brother. 'This is a significant prevention,' a Shin Bet official said. 'Had the attack been carried out during Ramadan, it could have destabilized the situation and led to dangerous escalation in the Jerusalem area during a period of heightened security tension.'

US Senate votes unanimously to demand toppling of Hamas	Bipartisan resolution in the US Senate passed unanimously demands the total removal of Hamas from military and political control of the Gaza Strip, backs Israel's right to self defense against Hamas and Iran, and calls on President Trump to target Iranian funding of Hamas. By World Israel News Staff The U.S. Senate unanimously passed last week a bipartisan resolution demanding the toppling of the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip, and calling on the Trump administration to aggressively target Iranian funding of the Gaza terror group. The resolution, which was passed by unanimous consent in the upper chamber of Congress Thursday evening, affirms that Hamas cannot retain any political or military control of the Gaza Strip. It was introduced by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Jackie Rosen (D-Nevada), Katie Britt (R-Alabama) and John Fetterman (D-Pennsylvania). 'I am very pleased the entire U.S. Senate spoke with moral clarity when it comes to the barbaric terrorist organization called Hamas,' said Graham. 'With one voice, the Senate said Hamas cannot be in charge of Gaza militarily or politically ever again. That is the right and only answer. I am very proud of my Senate colleagues.' The bill's cosponsor, Senator Blumenthal, said the Islamist terror group Hamas is 'anathema—to Palestinians and Israelis alike, indeed to all who live in the region.' 'Their barbarity and inhumanity is a terrorist scourge—demonstrated most tragically in the October 7 massacre—and a major barrier to peace and stability. Eliminating Hamas ought to be common ground as a paramount goal.' Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton called Hamas a 'group of murderous terrorists with American and Israeli blood on their hands. The United States must back Israel to the hilt and help ensure Hamas isn’t allowed to retain any political or military control in Gaza.' In addition to calling for the removal of Hamas from power in Gaza - both as a military force and as the de facto civil government - the resolution also urges President Donald Trump to use all economic and diplomatic tools possible to halt all sources of funding for Hamas by Iran and all other sources of revenue; and affirms U.S. support for Israel's right to self-defense against Hamas, Iran, and other Iranian proxies. 'On October 7th, Hamas terrorists murdered, raped, and kidnapped innocent civilians,' said Rosen. 'In order to best ensure the safety and security of Israel, as well as the Palestinian people, Hamas cannot be allowed to remain in power in Gaza in any capacity. I’m proud to have helped introduce and pass this bipartisan resolution to support our democratic ally Israel and reaffirm the need to remove Hamas from power.' 'The threat of Hamas must be ended permanently,' said Senator Britt of Alabama. 'Our support for Israel’s right to defend herself is unwavering as they work to bring every single hostage home. Only through strength can we achieve lasting, sustainable peace.' Pennsylvania Democrat John Fetterman reiterated his support for the remaining hostages held in the Gaza Strip. 'Hamas must be cut off from any grip on power. I stand with Israel and remain committed to its right to defend itself against Hamas terrorists who threaten its sovereignty and its people. The devastation in Gaza is on Hamas—and they will be held accountable. I’m going to keep fighting for the release of every hostage and for real peace in the region.'

Former hostage Tal Shoham – ‘I refused to kneel’	Given barely 300 calories-worth of food a day and beaten frequently, he said he and his fellow hostages 'preserved our humanity between each other.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Former hostage Tal Shoham told of being starved, physically beaten and psychologically abused for most of his 505 days of imprisonment but refusing to show fear or submission to his Hamas captors in an interview aired Saturday on Fox News. Shoham, his wife, Adi and two young daughters, Nave and Yahel, bolted to the safe room of Adi’s parents in Kibbutz Be’eri when Hamas terrorists took over the community during their October 7th, 2023 invasion of southern Israel. When they got the window open, he came out to surrender, hoping to keep his family safe. Shoham was tossed into a car trunk driven the few necessary minutes to enter the Gaza Strip. A crowd of civilians quickly formed who tried to beat him with sticks. One of the terrorists pointed a rifle at him and wanted him to kneel. Thinking he was going to die on the spot, Shoham defied him. 'I said, ‘I can’t control whether you kill me or not,’ and I raised my hands — but I refused to kneel. ‘If you want to kill me, kill me, but you will not execute me like ISIS.’' He was then forced to walk through the streets through a 'mob,' he said, who were screaming at him and trying to hit him, 'But I just waved and smiled. I didn’t show fear. ‘You’ve captured me, but you won’t see terror in my eyes.’' Kept alone and shackled for 34 days in a family home, he was starved from the first day, but what was worse than the hunger, he said, was the isolation and the torture of not knowing if his family was alive. As a tactic to keep himself sane, he imagined their funerals and buried them in his mind while crying in a way that his captors would not see him. 'That was the hardest thing I’ve ever done — burying my family in my mind,' he noted. When Adi and the girls were freed in the first hostage deal seven weeks into the war, the terrorists gave him a letter from her, and that gave him strength. 'The most important thing had happened — my family was safe,' he said. 'I didn’t need to be a father and husband protecting them anymore. Now, I could focus on my war, the one I knew how to fight, the one for survival.' Two hostages taken from the Nova dance festival, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, were then brought to the same home, so he was no longer alone. They were beaten 'daily,' he said, forced to stay in bed, speak only in whispers, and given almost no food while their captors ate in plain sight. In June, they were moved via ambulance to a tunnel where they found another hostage, Omer Wenkert. Their room contained four mattresses on the floor, a hole in the ground that was their toilet, and one dim bulb for light. 'It took me weeks to stop feeling like the walls were closing in, to adapt to the oxygen deprivation,' Shoham said. Given only a little rice and 300 ml of water each day and physically harshly abused, he and David developed serious infections, with Shoham’s leg turning 'blue, yellow, and purple with internal bleeding.' Months passed before a doctor was brought to examine them, and all he gave them was a week’s worth of vitamin supplements, but 'it dramatically improved our condition.' The Israelis refused to be degraded by the constant threats and abuse they suffered, Shoham said. 'There was dignity,' he asserted. 'The terrorists brought in whatever horrors they wanted, inflicted whatever cruelty and pain they could, imposed their inhumanity on us. But within our space, we preserved our inner cleanliness, our humanity between one another. And that was crucial to making it out unbroken.' Shoham also noted that the terrorists were seemingly not deterred by the evisceration of their forces by the IDF during the 15 months of warfaire. The hostages heard their captors constantly digging in order to broaden their underground network even as the IDF was blowing up the most strategic passages among the hundreds of miles of terror tunnels the army found throughout the Strip. 'Hamas never stopped digging tunnels,' Shoham said. 'Not for a single day.'

Israeli NBA player Deni Avdija clocks in career-high performance	Avdija — who was drafted in 2020 and is the only current NBA player born in Israel — played for 41 minutes and scored 27 points, a team-high 15 rebounds, and five assists during the Trail Blazer’s 114-113 loss to the Knicks. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Israeli basketball player and Portland Trail Blazers forward Deni Avdija has been putting on the best performance of his career this month in the final leg of the NBA season. This month marks the first time in Avdija’s NBA career that he achieved a first half double-double, and he did it twice in two games. A double-double is completed when a basketball player achieves double-digit numbers in two of the five major statistical categories (assists, blocks, points, rebounds and steals) during a single game. Avdija achieved 30 points — his first career triple double – 12 rebounds and 10 assists in an overtime loss to Cleveland on March 2, and a 27-point double-double during his team’s Wednesday night overtime loss to the New York Knicks. Avdija — who was drafted in 2020 and is the only current NBA player born in Israel — played for 41 minutes and scored 27 points, a team-high 15 rebounds and five assists during the Trail Blazer’s 114-113 loss to the Knicks at the Moda Center in Portland. On Monday night, Avdija returned to the court after missing two games due to a left quad contusion and scored a career-high 34 points, along with 16 rebounds during his team’s 130-120 loss were both season-highs. The Trailblazers have been relying heavily on the 24-year-old since Jerami Grant and Deandre Ayton have been off the roster due to knee and calf injuries, respectively, while Jabari Walker stepped out of Wednesday’s game after a mere 11 minutes because of a concussion. In a post-game interview on Wednesday night, a reporter asked Avdija about his stellar performances recently. 'I’m working very hard. I felt very down on myself in the beginning of the year,' he explained. 'I was definitely questioning myself – how can I help the team? How I’m gonna fit in? And I had a lot of worries when I came. But our organization, the players around me and the coaches, they really hugged and embraced me. And they really helped me to understand that I can really help this team. And this is what I’m trying to do. I’m giving my heart out, night in [and] night out. [Doing] treatment and hours like late night, just to try to get ready as much as possible to help the team. Right now I’m not thinking. I’m just playing hard, and wanna win games and that’s about it.' Portland acquired Avdija from the Washington Wizards in July 2024. The former Maccabi Tel Aviv player was the ninth overall selection by the Washington Wizards in the 2020 NBA Draft.

IDF kills two Hezbollah terrorists in Southern Lebanon	On Tuesday, Jerusalem and Beirut initiated negotiations toward settling their border dispute. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces on Sunday morning targeted and killed two Hezbollah terrorists in Southern Lebanon. According to the IDF, the Islamists were involved in surveillance operations and played a key role in directing terrorist attacks in the Yatar and Mais al-Jabal areas. The IDF emphasized that these activities by the terrorists breached the established understandings between Jerusalem and Beirut, highlighting a violation of the agreed-upon terms. On Saturday, the IDF struck a Hezbollah terrorist operating in the area of Kfarkela (aka Kfar Kila) in southeastern Lebanon, the military said. On Thursday night, the IDF attacked a site in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley used by Iranian-backed Hezbollah to produce 'strategic weapons.' The situation in Lebanon remains volatile following the end of the truce on Feb. 18. The ceasefire, which went into effect on Nov. 27, ended more than a year of war after Hezbollah began attacks on Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, one day after the Hamas-led massacre in the northwestern Negev. On Tuesday, Jerusalem and Beirut initiated negotiations toward settling their border dispute. Representatives of the IDF, the United States, France and Lebanon agreed during a meeting in Naqoura in southwestern Lebanon to establish three joint working groups aimed at stabilizing the region. The working groups will focus on three main issues: The five strategic points in Southern Lebanon that remain under Israeli control following the expiration of the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire; the U.N.-delineated Blue Line border and the 13 territorial disputes between the two countries; and the status of Lebanese detainees held by Israel.

Sinwar documents reveal scenarios for Israel’s elimination	The documents seized in Gaza show that over the past decade, Hamas began formulating a practical strategy to bring about the end of the State of Israel. By Shachar Kleiman, JNS Captured Hamas documents found in Gaza reveal that following the IDF’s 'Operation Guardian of the Walls' in May 2021, the terrorist organization came to believe that 'the destruction of Israel' was 'a goal that can be achieved in the near future.' This change was also evident in a series of public statements by Hamas leaders, a report from the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center explains. These statements were apparently dismissed by Israel as empty boasts. The report, written by Uri Roset of Sapir College, assesses that the severe blow suffered by Hamas and other elements in the pro-Iranian axis in the current war is likely to push back the 'destruction plan' for Israel, reducing it to little more than a vision. Nevertheless, the report warns that 'if Hamas manages to recover and receives support from Iran, it cannot be ruled out that it will once again treat the idea of ‘destroying Israel’ as an actionable plan in the future.' Hamas’s rejection of Israel’s existence was a given ever since the terrorist organization’s founding. However, the Islamist group was aware of its limitations. In recent years, however, a dramatic shift took place. The documents seized in Gaza show that over the past decade, Hamas began formulating a practical strategy to bring about the end of the State of Israel. A document titled 'The Movement’s Strategy 2013–2017' framed the confrontation with Israel primarily in defensive terms, addressing potential Israeli attacks from the air and sea. It advocated for 'resistance' through a 'realistic plan,' including an intifada in Judea and Samaria, an uprising among Israeli Arabs, and targeting Jews in international forums. Building on this, in a letter dated June 5, 2021, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his senior cohorts Mohammed Deif and Marwan Issa wrote to Quds Force commander Brig. Gen. Esmail Ghaani, stating their objective: 'The great victory and the removal of the cancer,' referring to Israel’s elimination. 'We will never close our eyes, rest, or remain silent until we achieve this sacred goal,' they declared. They sought to acquire $500 million over two years. The letter read: 'Brother Mujahid Commander, to achieve these great objectives, through which we will change the face of the universe, with Allah’s help, we desperately need financial assistance of $20 million per month for two years, totaling $500 million. We are certain that by the end of these two years—or even during them, Allah willing—we will uproot this distorted entity. Together, we will change the region and, ultimately, Allah willing, this dark era in our nation’s history.' In another letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, the three men wrote: 'This imaginary entity is weaker than people think. With Allah’s help, your support, and the backing of our nation, we are capable of uprooting it and removing it as soon as possible. We trust in Allah that we are close to fulfilling this divine promise, from which there is no escape.' Sinwar also sent a letter to Saeed Izadi, head of the Quds Force’s 'Palestine Branch,' in July 2021, declaring that they were on the verge of a 'tremendous strategic victory' with major regional and global implications. Hamas was 'on the threshold of victory and the fulfillment of Allah’s promise,' he wrote. Two months after 'Operation Guardian of the Walls,' Sinwar wrote to Izadi: 'Everyone has noticed the strategic shift in the movement’s policy and direction under Abu al-Abd’s [Ismail Haniyeh‘s] leadership, which corrected many past imbalances. While we understand that we have not achieved all our goals, there is no doubt that we have made significant progress in the desired direction. In the coming years, we have a great opportunity to complete this journey, consolidating the Jerusalem Alliance, the Axis of the Second Promise, and assembling the necessary tools to achieve this.' A year later, in a letter to Haniyeh on June 19, 2022, Sinwar outlined a practical strategic scenario for a multi-front war aimed at Israel’s destruction. He opened by stating: 'Since the ceasefire in ‘Sword of Jerusalem’ [Hamas’s name for ‘Guardian of the Walls’], our jihad fighters have been preparing at full speed and without hesitation. They are confident that their readiness for a major strategic battle that will reshape the region and its rules of engagement is nearly complete. They are fully prepared to launch immediately if Allah wills it.' Sinwar then outlined three scenarios for 'unifying the fronts and seizing the opportunity': The Grand Strategic Campaign: The entire pro-Iranian axis, except for Iran itself, would attack Israel to bring about its end. Sinwar considered this an achievable goal if Hezbollah possessed even a third of its rumored capabilities and fully joined the battle, alongside Shi’ite militias from Iraq and Syria and the Houthis in Yemen. He also mentioned additional elements, including terrorists on the Jordanian border and uprisings in Judea and Samaria and among Israeli Arabs. He wrote: 'The banner of the campaign must be Al-Aqsa and Al-Quds [Jerusalem] because this is a nuclear trigger for the entire region. The timing should coincide with a Jewish holiday when their incursions into Al-Aqsa [i.e., the Temple Mount], attacks and Talmudic prayers increase. Passover, which overlaps in some way with Ramadan, is the most suitable, but other Jewish holidays could ignite the explosion.' The Intermediate Battle Scenario: Hamas would play the central role in a conflict against Israel, while Hezbollah would participate partially, along with forces from other fronts, including Judea and Samaria. Sinwar believed this would cause significant harm to Israel, prompting many Israelis to emigrate and leading to the 'liberation' of Judea and Samaria and the release of Palestinian prisoners. He argued that this would lay the groundwork for Israel’s eventual destruction. The Minimal Scenario: Hezbollah would not initially participate directly. Hamas would bear the primary burden, supported by 'the resistance axis' and terrorists from Jordan and Syria. According to the document, this was the minimum scenario Hamas could accept, requiring only Hezbollah and its leader Hassan Nasrallah‘s approval, without needing authorization from Khamenei. Sinwar wrote: 'This is a necessary scenario in which we throw all our forces into igniting the situation in the West Bank and inside [the pre-1967 lines]. Meanwhile, the party [Hezbollah] ensures our forces can operate with increasing efficiency from Lebanon, while Quds Force elements engage from Iraq and Yemen, and guerrilla activities escalate in Syria and Jordan. The party will not participate directly, but it guarantees the activation of everything mentioned above while maintaining the highest level of readiness to escalate to medium or high-intensity conflict as developments dictate. This is the minimum scenario we can agree upon.' In practice, Hezbollah and the pro-Iranian militias played a limited role in the conflict, with Hamas bearing most of the burden. Sinwar’s hopes for broader participation from other actors did not materialize. Later, in July 2022, then-Hamas political bureau chief Haniyeh informed Sinwar of a meeting with Izadi and Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. At the meeting, Hamas representatives presented their attack scenarios. According to Haniyeh, Nasrallah expressed support for the first scenario—the 'Grand Battle'—and even described it as a 'realistic scenario.' It was also agreed that the matter would be raised with Khamenei. Haniyeh wrote to Sinwar: 'We presented our vision for the path forward, explaining that we had studied the issue within our circles in Gaza and the West Bank. Regarding our brothers abroad, they are currently conducting a general analysis of the conflict with the enemy, but they are not yet fully informed of the detailed scenarios and vision. We presented the first and second scenarios from your letter but did not mention the third. After a long and in-depth dialogue, Sayyed Nasrallah’s position was clear and firm…' The post Sinwar documents reveal scenarios for Israel’s elimination appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/sinwar-documents-reveal-scenarios-for-israels-elimination/	2025-03-16T02:48:35-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP21144585755772-1.jpg
‘Total war’ – Hamas calls for Judea and Samaria terror attacks	Senior Hamas leaders demand Palestinians attack Israelis in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff Senior Hamas leader Abdul Hakim Hanini urged terrorists in Judea and Samaria to take up arms against Israelis in an incendiary statement over the weekend. Clashes between Israelis and Palestinians in Judea and Samaria are 'part of the total war initiated by the criminal Zionist occupation [Israel] against our Palestinian people,' Hanini claimed. Hanini claimed that individual Israelis who scuffled with Arabs in Judea and Samaria are committing 'terrorism' and that they are acting on behalf of the Israeli government 'in order to implement their malicious plans aimed at displacing our people from their land.' The Hamas official warned that 'these Israeli plans will shatter against the steadfastness of the Palestinian people, regardless of the casualties that may arise as a result.' Hanini demanded that Palestinians fight back against 'settler attacks throughout [Judea and Samaria] and&#8230;Jerusalem by escalating confrontations and struggles in all arenas.' Another senior Hamas member, Hossam Badran, urged local Muslims to act against the so-called 'Judaization' of the Temple Mount, in an apparent reference to an uptick of Jewish visitors to the compound throughout Purim holiday. 'Our people will thwart all plans for displacement and will remain a shield to protect Al-Aqsa Mosque from the brutality of the occupation and its Judaization,' Badran said. The Temple Mount compound, which is the holiest site for Jews but under the control of the Islamic Wakf organization, has seen a massive increase in Jewish pilgrims in recent years. While the ceasefire in Gaza between Hamas and Israel expired in early March, both sides have yet to return to fighting. Israel has carried out precision airstrikes on terrorists in the Strip that pose an immediate threat to Israeli troops. Hamas has been steadfast in its refusal to release more hostages, demanding that Israel officially agree to phase two of the hostage agreement - which would see a full IDF withdrawal from Gaza.

Netanyahu pushing for release of 11 living hostages	Israeli prime minister instructs negotiating team in Qatar to back US mediator's proposal to extend the Gaza ceasefire and to release more convicted terrorists in exchange for the immediate return of 11 living captives. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Israel's hostage negotiating team Saturday night to push for Hamas to free 11 living hostages in exchange for a continuation of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, under the terms laid out by the Trump administration. In an announcement issued by the Prime Minister's Office overnight, Netanyahu's aides said the premier had held an in-depth discussion with his advisors 'on the issue of the hostages, with the participation of the negotiating team and the heads of the security establishment.' Following the discussion, the Prime Minister instructed the negotiating team to prepare for the continuation of the talks 'as per the mediators' response to the Witkoff proposal for the immediate release of 11 living hostages and half of the deceased hostages.' Last week, Steve Witkoff, the billionaire real estate mogul tapped by President Donald Trump as his special envoy to the Middle East, reportedly proposed a new hostage deal to extend the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The framework proposed by Witkoff includes a 50-day ceasefire extension and the release of additional convicted terrorists, in exchange for the return of a number of hostages held by Hamas. The statement issued by Netanyahu's office confirms the proposal, setting the number of hostages to be released at the outset of the ceasefire at 11, and signalling Israel's backing for the deal. The previous ceasefire lapsed on March 2nd, with Hamas and Israel failing to agree to a framework for extending the truce and continuing the release of hostages from Gaza. Israel and the Trump administration have called for an extension of the first phase of the ceasefire, while Hamas has demanded that any additional hostage releases be conducted under the rubric of the second phase of the January 19th deal.

BBC mislabels Israeli city, Syrian village as ‘illegal Israeli se...	British national broadcaster apologizes after it used footage of an Israeli city in pre-1967 Israel during a segment on what it called 'illegal Israeli settlements' in the Golan Heights. By World Israel News Staff Britain's national broadcaster is again under fire for errors in its news coverage of Israel which some supporters of the Jewish state have claimed are part of a broader pattern of anti-Israel bias and even antisemitism. In December 2024, BBC Arabic published a video piece on the Golan Heights, following the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria and the Israeli military's deployment of forces into the demilitarized zone on the Syrian side of the Golan. The DMZ, established following the 1973 Yom Kippur War, was formed from territory held by Israel since 1967, captured by Syria at the outset of the 1973 war, then recaptured by IDF forces. While Israel retained control over most of the strategic highground, roughly 30% of the Golan was placed under Syrian civil control, most of which was designated as a demilitarized zone, secured by United Nations peacekeepers. Following the return of Israeli forces to the DMZ in December 2024, BBC Arabic released a video segment on Israel's presence in the Golan since 1967, including coverage of Israeli towns in the area. The video piece stated that 'The settlements are considered illegal according to international law.' While United States recognizes Israeli sovereignty over most of the Golan, the European Union, United Nations, Russia, China, and Canada do not. However, the media watchdog group CAMERA (Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis) later found that the BBC segment had used footage of an Israeli city, Tiberias, located inside the country's pre-1967 boundaries during its coverage of Israeli 'settlements' in the Golan. 'There are more than 30 Israeli settlements in the Golan,' the segment's voiceover and subtitles said as footage of Tiberias was shown. Tiberias has has a 'continuous Jewish presence since the 1700s at least,' a CAMERA spokesperson told the London-based Jewish Chronicle. The spokesperson argued that the error 'fuels' antisemitic tropes regarding Jews. 'By implying that it is a 'settlement' while regularly referring to nearby Arab communities, some far newer, as 'villages' or 'towns', BBC Arabic fuels the antisemitic stereotype according to which Israel's Jews can never be truly indigenous to the land.' 'More broadly speaking, given the BBC's long standing and disproportionate focus on Jewish 'settlements', one might expect BBC Arabic editors to at least know what they look like.' The segment also used footage of Syrian villages in the Golan as examples of 'Israeli settlements.' The BBC later reached out to CAMERA to issue an apology, while denying that the errors constituted 'racism.' 'We apologise for the errors but also do not accept the interpretation of these errors as 'racism',' the BBC told CAMERA, according to a report by the Jewish Chronicle on Friday. The apology comes on the heels of a larger scandal regarding a BBC documentary on the Israel-Arab conflict. At the end of February, the London police department's counter-terror force launched a preliminary probe into the production of a BBC documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, after it was revealed that the film's narrator is the son of a Hamas minister in Gaza. The payments to the narrator's family raised questions regarding the possible misuse of public funds to support a designated terrorist organization.

Brother of murdered hostage calls for ‘uprising’ against Netanyah...	Danny Elgarat has long blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, rather than the Hamas terror group, for his brother's slaying. By World Israel News Staff The brother of a murdered hostage, whose body was recently returned to Israel, called for a mass civil rebellion against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday evening. Danny Elgarat, the brother of Itzik Elgarat, has long been a fierce critic of Netanyahu, often focusing his criticism for the hostages' ordeal on the premier, rather than the Hamas terror group. While speaking at a rally urging a hostage deal on Saturday night in Tel Aviv, Elgarat said that Netanyahu will be put 'on trial for crimes against the nation of Israel.' Elgarat continued by addressing Netanyahu, saying that the crowd of some 2,500 demonstrators is indicative of a public rebellion on the horizon. 'What you see here today is an uprising,' he said. He also called for a widespread closure of businesses throughout the country, as a way to pressure the government into a hostage deal. 'Shut down the malls, banks, tech sector,' Elgarat added. Elgarat also compared Netanyahu to Haman, the villain of the Purim story, who pushed for a genocide of all the Jews in ancient Persia and was ultimately executed. On October 7th, Elgarat was in touch with his brother Itzik as terrorist invaded Kibbutz Nir Oz. Itzik was wounded before he was kidnapped, telling Danny that 'this is the end.' It's believed that Itzik was abducted to Gaza by Hamas terrorists while still alive. it's unclear at what point in captivity he died from wounds he sustained during the terror onslaught. Elgarat has long focused his ire on Netanyahu, holding him responsible for his brother's murder. After Itzik's body was returned from Gaza in early March, Danny Elgarat railed against Netanyahu at his funeral. 'Today you’re being laid to eternal rest in a grave dug for you by the prime minister himself,' Elgarat addressed his brother, during his eulogy. 'Netanyahu defeated us and you didn’t return from captivity,' he added. 'The enemy who caused your death was not the one who abducted you, but the one who abandoned you.'

Sec. of State Marco Rubio says ‘persona non grata’ South African ...	South Africa's ambassador to the US Ebrahim Rasool criticized Trump's pro-Israel policies and called him a white supremacist. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio referred to South Africa's ambassador to the US, Embrahim Rasool, as a 'persona non grata' who was no longer welcome in the US after he publicly accused President Donald Trump of white supremacy. Rubio wrote on X, 'South Africa's Ambassador to the United States is no longer welcome in our great country. Embrahim Rasool is a race-baiting politician who hates America and hates @POTUS. We have nothing to discuss with him and so he is considered PERSONA NON GRATA.' On Thursday, Rasool addressed the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection (MISTRA) in Johannesburg, where he criticized Trump's pro-Israel policies and called him a white supremacist. Rasool said, 'What Donald Trump is launching is an assault on incumbency, those who are in power, by mobilizing a supremacism against the incumbency &#8230; We see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the MAGA movement, the Make America Great Again movement, as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white.' Trump has cut aid to South Africa, citing its discriminatory land appropriation policies and its accusing Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice. In an executive order issued in February, Trump stated, 'In shocking disregard of its citizens' rights, the Republic of South Africa recently enacted Expropriation Act 13 of 2024, to enable the government of South Africa to seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property without compensation.' 'The United States cannot support the government of South Africa's commission of rights violations in its country or its undermining United States foreign policy, which poses national security threats to our Nation, our allies, our African partners, and our interests,' the order said.

Children in Israel and beyond are dressing as Batman for Purim to...	A costume shop in Jerusalem offered up Bibas-honoring Batman garb for just 10 shekels (about $2.75). By Philissa Cramer, JTA For a year and a half, a photograph of the Bibas family wearing Batman pajamas served as a symbol of the global vigil for their return from captivity in Gaza. Batman was a passion for Ariel, who was 4 when he and his family were abducted from their home in southern Israeli on Oct. 7, 2023. He had dressed as the superhero for Purim that year, and his parents, Shiri and Yarden, were happy to buy matching gear for the entire family, including his new baby brother Kfir. Now, on the first Purim since Shiri, Ariel and Kfir were confirmed dead and returned to Israel for burial — and with Yarden back in Israel after a hostage release last month — Jews around the world are dressing as Batman in their honor. In Israel, entire classes of schoolchildren have worn orange Batman capes and masks, in a nod to both Ariel Bibas’ passion for the superhero and the brothers’ red hair, while a costume shop in Jerusalem offered up Bibas-honoring Batman garb for just 10 shekels (about $2.75). 'This is a pure loss from my own pocket, but I want to do it,' the store’s owner told the Jerusalem Post. 'I see in all the comments that there’s a huge desire to dress up as Batman for Purim in honor of the Bibas family. So I got masks — one shekel each — just so TikTok on Purim will be filled with this mask.' In the United States, parents have imbued their children’s dress-up closets with emotional significance. 'My little Batman has no idea of the significance of his Purim costume choice this year,' one mother wrote on an Instagram story this week. Another family posted a video about putting together Batman-themed mishloach manot, the sweets-filled gift bags that are traditionally distributed on the holiday. A Purim call to action began circulating in late February, after Hamas released Shiri, Ariel and Kfir’s bodies as part of a ceasefire deal. In the days leading up to the holiday, which commemorates the ancient Persian Jews’ triumph over a plot to kill them and is celebrated with costume parties and other rituals, the Bibas family said it had gotten many questions about whether it was appropriate to take part in the call. Yes, said the family, which has sought to manage the collective memory of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir as well as Yarden’s exposure to new trauma. And on Wednesday, as Israel began its festivities, the family posted about the widespread Batman costumes. 'The heart missed a beat twice today. Once when we woke up to a morning without new photos of Ariel and Kfir dressed up for Purim, and the second time when we saw all the incredible gestures on the streets of Israel,' the family said on its social media account alongside a photograph of Yarden holding a plea for the return of his best friend David Cunio and his brother Ariel Cunio, who remain in captivity. 'Time after time during the last almost year and a half and especially during the last few weeks, you have shown us that Ariel and Kfir will never leave us,' the family said. The family became an intense symbol of the Israeli hostages in Gaza for the more than a year during which Ariel and Kfir were the only children who remained in captivity, and their fate remained unknown. 'All kids are Batman for Purim. Mine don’t want to be. What do I do?' one parent wrote to the pro-Israel influencer Jonny Daniels, in a question he posted on his Instagram account. His response: 'Let them do exactly what they want. This is a festival for them, not our guilt. … We all mourn and connect in different ways. We don’t need to force our children to do that.'

US launches broad airstrikes on Yemen	Since Hamas’s October 7 attack, the Houthis have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS The White House announced the US launched broad airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on Saturday night. 'To all Houthi terrorists, your time is up and your attacks must stop starting today. If they don’t, Hell will rain down upon you like nothing you have ever seen before,' US President Donald Trump said in a statement. 'To Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end immediately' Trump added. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels recently threatened they would resume attacks on Red Sea shipping and missile attacks on Israel. Israel suspended deliveries of humanitarian aid to Gaza and closed all of its crossings on March 2 amid Hamas’s refusal to accept a US outline for continued ceasefire talks. The Houthis vowed in December 2023 to target any Israel-bound ship in the Red Sea, regardless of its ownership. From bases along the Yemeni coast, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels have attacked or harassed around 100 ships in the Red Sea as they traverse the Bab el-Mandeb Straits, a narrow maritime choke point between the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. The majority of the world’s oil passes through the strait from the Indian Ocean towards the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea. Their attacks have brought the Port of Eilat to a standstill. The attacks also had a devastating impact on Egypt as Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty recently confirmed that revenue from the Suez Canal has dropped 60%. Since Hamas’s October 7 attack, the Houthis have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel. The majority have been intercepted before reaching Israeli airspace. Israel launched several retaliatory airstrikes on Houthi positions, most recently in January. At least 1,180 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 59 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed to be dead.

Trump envoy Witkoff blasts Hamas for ‘unrealistic demands’ and it...	Through intermediaries, Witkoff demanded the immediate release of five US hostages, including four bodies and one live captive Edan Alexander. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steven Witkoff criticized Hamas for making 'unrealistic demands' in exchange for remaining US hostages and said the terror group is making a poor gamble. After making a proposal to extend the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, Witkoff slammed Hamas on Friday for giving the public impression that it would release US hostages but privately making unreasonable demands. 'Hamas is making a very poor gamble by believing that time is on its side. That is not the case. Hamas is well aware of the deadline and must understand that we will respond accordingly if it passes,' Witkoff cautioned. 'According to the mediation proposal, Hamas will release live hostages in exchange for prisoners based on previous formulas. The first stage of the ceasefire will be extended to allow for the resumption of significant humanitarian aid, and the US will work to achieve a stable solution to the ongoing conflict during the extended ceasefire period,' said Witkoff. Through intermediaries, Witkoff demanded the immediate release of five US hostages, including four bodies and one live captive Edan Alexander. 'Unfortunately, Hamas has chosen to respond by publicly declaring flexibility while secretly presenting demands that are completely impossible without a permanent ceasefire,' he said. Witkoff's proposal includes a 50-day period during which hostages and prisoners would be released, and the two parties would negotiate a lasting ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement described Hamas's message that it was willing to release the hostages as 'mere manipulation' and 'psychological warfare' against families of hostages. 'Hamas's so-called 'offer' to release hostages with American citizenship is nothing more than a ploy to derail negotiations and a form of manipulation,' the statement said. The Prime Minister's Office added, 'While Israel has accepted the Witkoff framework, Hamas continues to reject it and engages in psychological warfare against the families of the hostages. The Prime Minister will convene the ministerial team tomorrow evening for a comprehensive briefing from the negotiating team and to determine the next steps in securing the release of the hostages and achieving all of our war objectives.'

Columbia activist who endorsed Hamas’s ‘anticolonial liberation m...	About two months after Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, Srinivasan signed a letter that declared solidarity with the 'anticolonial liberation movement in Palestine' and accused the U.S. and Israeli governments of perpetrating a 'cycle of settler colonial violence.' By Jessica Costescu, The Washington Free Beacon A Columbia University doctoral student who expressed support for the 'anticolonial liberation movement in Palestine' used the Trump administration’s revamped 'CBP Home' app to self-deport to Canada about a week after Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked her student visa, the Department of Homeland Security announced Friday. Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian national and doctoral candidate in Urban Planning at Columbia’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation was 'involved in activities supporting Hammas [sic], a terrorist organization,' according to the DHS announcement. The department shared footage from Tuesday of Srinivasan using the 'CBP Home' app, the Trump administration’s newly transformed version of the Biden-era 'CBP One' app that aims to streamline the self-deportation of illegal immigrants. It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live & study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked and you should not be in this country. I’m glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers… pic.twitter.com/jR2uVVKGCM &mdash; Secretary Kristi Noem (@Sec_Noem) March 14, 2025 'We will continue to look for people that we would never have allowed into this country on student visas had we known they were going to do what they’ve done, but now that they’ve done it, we’re gonna get rid of them,' Rubio told reporters Friday morning from the G7 Summit in Canada. 'When they said they were coming here to be students, they didn’t say they were coming here to occupy university buildings and vandalize them and tear them apart and hold campuses hostage. If they had told us that, we would never have given them a student visa.' 'In the days to come, you should expect more visas will be revoked as we identify people that we should never have allowed in because they lied to us,' Rubio added. 'Every time we have a chance to revoke them, we will, because it’s not in the national interest of the United States for them to be here,' he added. About two months after Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, Srinivasan signed a letter alongside other 'Scholars of the Constructed Environment,' titled 'Palestinian Liberation Is Our Collective Liberation.' The letter declared solidarity with the 'anticolonial liberation movement in Palestine' and accused the U.S. and Israeli governments of perpetrating a 'cycle of settler colonial violence.' Srinivasan’s interests include the 'historical geographies of capitalism and caste,' while her research focuses include 'colonial rule' and 'global capitalist restructuring,' according to her university webpage. The recipient of the prestigious Fulbright scholarship earned her master’s degree in 'critical conservation' at Harvard University. Prior to beginning her Ph.D. program at Columbia, Srinivasan worked as a project associate at a D.C.-based environmental nonprofit where she 'campaigned for critical landscapes and frontier communities at-risk from climate change.' While at Columbia, Srinivasan was employed as a teaching assistant, according to a university directory. Last fall, she taught a course at New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. In a Thursday night statement, Columbia’s interim president Katrina Armstrong wrote that she was 'heartbroken' that DHS agents, who presented the school with judicial warrants, had conducted searches in two student rooms. 'I am writing heartbroken to inform you that we had federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in two University residences tonight,' Armstrong wrote. 'No one was arrested or detained. No items were removed, and no further action was taken.' DHS also announced that Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested another student, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from Judea and Samaria, for overstaying her expired F-1 student visa, which had been terminated on Jan. 26, 2022, for lack of attendance. She was also arrested in April 2024 'for her involvement in pro-Hamas protests at Columbia University in New York City,' according to DHS. Columbia denied that Kordia was ever enrolled at the university. On Saturday, ICE apprehended Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia student activist and foreign national, after the State Department revoked his visa and green card over his pro-Hamas campus organizing. Two days later, Judge Jesse Furman paused Khalil’s deportation proceedings as the federal court considers a petition challenging his arrest. On Wednesday, Furman—an Obama appointee—instructed attorneys for both parties to submit a joint letter on Friday outlining further plans for arguments in the case. Furman is a prolific Democratic donor, contributing over $20,000 to Democrats, including President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic National Committee. He also once threw out a terrorism lawsuit against the Palestine Liberation Organization. Meanwhile, one of Khalil’s attorneys, Ramzi Kassem, has defended al Qaeda terrorists including Ahmed al-Darbi, an al Qaeda member convicted in 2017 for the bombing of a French oil tanker, the Washington Free Beacon reported. Kassem also defended multiple Guantanamo Bay detainees, including a 'close associate' of Osama bin Laden. He went on to serve as an immigration policy adviser to former president Joe Biden on the White House's Domestic Policy Council. Srinivasan is not the first immigrant to self-deport this month. Diego de la Vega, an illegal immigrant who served as deputy communications director for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), fled the United States for Colombia, the Free Beacon reported on March 7. He had arrived from Ecuador at age seven and overstayed his visitor's visa.

IDF strikes Gazan terrorists planting bombs near troops	Also on Saturday, the IDF attacked two terrorists operating a drone that posed a threat to troops in the area of Beit Lahia, the northern Gaza Strip. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces on Saturday attacked three terrorists trying to plant explosives near troops operating in the area of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip, the military confirmed. The IDF on Friday attacked several terrorists attempting to plant bombs close to soldiers in central Gaza. A day earlier, an Israeli Air Force craft struck a group of terrorists trying to lay explosives in the same general area. Also on Saturday, the IDF attacked two terrorists operating a drone that posed a threat to troops in the area of Beit Lahia, the northern Gaza Strip. The military subsequently targeted additional terrorists who had collected the UAV and were attempting to flee by car. The first, 42-day phase of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas, which went into effect on Jan. 19, expired on March 1 after the terror group rejected an American proposal to extend the truce for 50 more days. Nevertheless, Israel has not returned to full-blown war in Gaza, instead opting to bide time in a bid to forge a deal to free additional hostages from Hamas captivity. According to Israeli officials, there has been progress in negotiations with Hamas in Qatar, raising the possibility of a small-scale interim agreement.

Rubio: Hamas’s demands are ‘nuts,’ we’re dealing with ‘savages’	Earlier on Friday, Hamas said in a press statement that in response to a proposal from mediators to resume negotiations, it had agreed to 'release the Zionist soldier Edan Alexander, who holds American citizenship, in addition to the bodies of four other dual nationals.' By JNS U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday slammed as 'nuts' the terms being demanded by Hamas in hostage-ceasefire negotiations while insisting the Trump administration was committed to freeing all of the 59 captives held by the Palestinian terrorist group in Gaza. 'We care about all the hostages, we want all the hostages released. … But we’re also talking about bodies. And these trades that are being made, they’re ridiculous trades—400 people for three. These are nuts,' Rubio said at a press conference during the G7 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Charlevoix, Quebec. 'On top of that, you see the condition these people are being released in. … We’re sitting around as the world, sort of accepting that it’s normal and okay for you to go into a place, kidnap babies, kidnap teenagers, kidnap people who have nothing to do with any wars, that are not soldiers … and taking them and putting them in tunnels for almost a year and a half,' he continued. 'The whole world should continue to say that what Hamas has done is outrageous, it’s ridiculous, it’s sick, it’s disgusting. … We’re just dealing with some savages. That’s it. These are bad people, terrible people, and we need to treat them as such,' added Rubio. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday denounced as 'psychological warfare' a Hamas offer to release Edan Alexander, 21, in an effort to jump-start stalled talks. 'While Israel accepted the Witkoff plan, Hamas persisted in its refusal and did not move a millimeter,' according to a statement by the Prime Minister’s Office, referring to Trump administration special envoy Steve Witkoff’s proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire. 'At the same time, [Hamas] continues to employ manipulation and psychological warfare,' added the PMO. Netanyahu was set to convene his ministerial team on Saturday night to review a detailed report from its negotiators and decide on the next steps, the statement said. Earlier on Friday, Hamas said in a press statement that in response to a proposal from mediators to resume negotiations, it had agreed to 'release the Zionist soldier Edan Alexander, who holds American citizenship, in addition to the bodies of four other dual nationals.' On Friday, Witkoff said in a statement, 'Unfortunately, Hamas has chosen to respond by publicly claiming flexibility while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire.' Witkoff told press on March 6 that the U.S. wants Hamas to free Alexander as a show of goodwill. Alexander, 20, from Tenafly, N.J., is the only one of five American hostages in Gaza believed to still be alive. Israel estimates 59 hostages are still in Gaza, of whom 35 are believed to be dead. While Hamas insists on starting the second phase, and rejected Witkoff’s proposal, Israel has agreed to it. The proposal would extend the ceasefire through the holidays of Ramadan and Passover. Ramadan runs until March 29, while Passover begins on April 12 and ends on April 19. Israel is reportedly planning to resume its war against Hamas in the coming weeks. It has halted the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip.

No one should be surprised about Syrian massacres	The civilian death toll is now thought to be somewhere above 750, with over 1,000 people killed in total. By Jonathan Spyer, Middle East Forum Shock and outrage are appropriate, but no one really has an excuse for being surprised at the dreadful scenes that have emerged from Syria’s western coastal region in recent days. The civilian death toll is now thought to be somewhere above 750, with over 1,000 people killed in total (Alawi sources place the number much higher). Around 125 members of the Damascus regime’s security forces have also died. Video clips, many of them filmed by the perpetrators, show people in civilian clothes being summarily executed by Islamist gunmen; the humiliation of Syrian Alawi men and women; and the inevitable Sunni jihadi battle cries of ‘Allahu Akbar.’ The specifics of the situation are important (more on that in a moment), but the non-specifics are no less crucial. What has just happened in western Syria is what happens when Sunni jihadi fighters encounter a non-Muslim civilian population which they have defined as an enemy. It is what Islamic State did to the Yazidi people of the Nineveh plains in the summer of 2014. It is what happened to Israeli Jews near Gaza in October 2023. The fact that western governments have chosen to believe in recent months that the current Islamist rulers in Damascus exist somehow outside of the known patterns and practices of Sunni jihadi organisations should not obscure the simple, and terrible, truth: the massacre of civilians is an inherent element of the Sunni Islamist way of war. A number of Syrian sources have told me in recent days that the present Islamist regime in Damascus harbours a particular hatred for Syria’s Alawis, who they habitually refer to by the insulting name of ‘Nusayris.’ The present de facto President of Syria, Ahmed Sheraa, said in an interview in 2015 that in order to receive protection from the future Islamic regime that he and his comrades wished to establish, it would not be sufficient for Syria’s Alawis to renounce their support for the Assads. Rather, he said, they would need to ‘correct their doctrinal mistakes and embrace Islam.’ After which they would ‘become our brothers and we shall protect them as we protect ourselves.’ It is worth bearing this ominous warning in mind when considering the events of recent days. The Alawis are a sect that emerged from Twelver Shia Islam in the ninth century, but which adopted beliefs which led to them being considered non-Muslims by both Sunni and Shia mainstream theology. Hafez Assad, Bashar’s father, and his closest colleagues emerged from this sect, and as a result, Syria was dominated by a core Alawi group for the half century of the Assad’s rule. The majority of Alawis saw limited benefit from the rule of the Assads. But the fall of the dictator has placed them in a uniquely vulnerable situation. Unlike Syria’s Druze and Kurds, they do not possess defence organisations. And unlike the Christians of the country, they do not enjoy the concern and attention of elements in the West. Fifty years of Assad rule was sufficient time for a long litany of individual acts of humiliation and disregard to take place and to remain in the minds of many Syrian Sunnis as good justification for revenge. All this, coupled with the undoubted efforts of former regime elements to mobilise resistance to the new government, led to the events of recent days. Regarding the specifics, the situation in Syria’s west had been building up to this point for some time. T, a Syrian Alawi woman now in Europe and hailing from a village in the Al-Ghab area of Syria’s Hama province, described to me a gradual increase of tensions beginning immediately after the fall of the Assads. ‘The attitude of this government towards Alawis is beyond any political orientation,’ she told me. ‘It’s ideological. Rooted in their thinking.’ T says there were widespread arrests of individual Alawis in the weeks preceding the latest events, and firings from workplaces. ‘But until now it wasn’t systematic,’ she said. The trigger for the massacre was an attack on security forces loyal to the new regime, in the Jableh area of Latakia province, on 6 March. Thirteen members of the Damascus security forces were killed. Following this, troops and gunmen loyal to Damascus descended on the coastal area, and the killing commenced. The government’s response appears to have consisted of a number of discrete elements, namely a heavy-handed assault using heavy weapons on areas considered loyal to counter regime forces, attacks by jihadi gunmen on individuals they deem to be connected to forces loyal to the former regime, and straightforward sectarian attacks on Alawi civilians, including women and children. While it is not yet clear who was responsible for the incident in the Jableh area, it is likely to indeed have been the work of elements loyal to the former regime. There is considerable evidence that a nascent structure intent on insurgency has been assembled in Syria’s west. Voices favourable to the current authorities in Damascus maintain that this structure is controlled from outside Syria, specifically by Iran-linked elements in Iraq, and is headed by one General Ghaith Dalla, formerly of the Assad regime’s notorious Fourth Division. Such claims are plausible. Iran lost heavily from the fall of Assad. Tehran remains the most skilled user of proxy military forces as a tool of policy in the Middle East. A group calling itself the ‘Syrian Islamic Resistance Front’ and professing loyalty to Iran announced itself earlier this month. It is not yet clear if this group had any connection to the attacks in Jableh. The existence of such a structure of course in no way contextualises, explains or justifies the massacres of civilians of recent days. But it should be borne in mind. What should be learned from all this? Firstly, and most importantly, that it is mistaken to regard HTS as the undisputed, legitimate rulers of Syria. They are better seen as a Sunni jihadi group currently dominant in Damascus, but facing determined opposition from a variety of quarters and locations. Secondly, that the practices of the ruling group and their evident attitudes towards non-Sunnis have not been transformed, and remain those of the Islamist and jihadi milieu from which they come. And lastly, and most tragically for the people of Syria of all sects, the situation in the country has not been resolved, and further strife almost certainly lies ahead.

US and Israel look to Africa for resettling Palestinians uprooted...	Netanyahu has described Trump's plan to move Gaza's 2 million residents during the rebuilding process as a 'bold vision.' By Sam Magdy, Associated Press The U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for resettling Palestinians uprooted from the Gaza Strip under President Donald Trump’s proposed postwar plan, American and Israeli officials told The Associated Press. The contacts with Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland reflect the determination by the U.S. and Israel to press ahead with a plan that has been widely condemned and raised serious legal and moral issues. Because all three places are poor, and in some cases wracked by violence, the proposal also casts doubt on Trump’s stated goal of resettling Gaza’s Palestinians in a 'beautiful area.' Officials from Sudan said they have rejected overtures from the U.S., while officials from Somalia and Somaliland told The Associated Press that they were not aware of any contacts. Under Trump’s plan, Gaza’s more than 2 million people would be permanently sent elsewhere. He has proposed the U.S. would take ownership of the territory, oversee a lengthy cleanup process and develop it as a real estate project. The idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once considered a fantasy of Israel’s far right wing. But since Trump presented the idea at a White House meeting last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed it as a ' bold vision.' Palestinians in Gaza have rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab nations have expressed vehement opposition and offered an alternative reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place. Rights groups have said forcing or pressuring the Palestinians to leave could be a potential war crime. Still, the White House says Trump 'stands by his vision.' Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, U.S. and Israeli officials confirmed the contacts with Somalia and Somaliland, while the Americans confirmed Sudan as well. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place. Separate outreach from the U.S. and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan alongside Netanyahu, according to the U.S. officials, who said that Israel was taking the lead in the discussions. Israel and the U.S. have a variety of incentives — financial, diplomatic and security — to offer these potential partners. It is a formula that Trump used five years ago when he brokered the Abraham Accords — a series of mutually beneficial diplomatic accords between Israel and four Arab countries. The White House declined to comment on the outreach efforts. The offices of Netanyahu and Ron Dermer, the Israeli Cabinet minister and Netanyahu confidant who has been leading Israel’s postwar planning, also had no comment. But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a longtime advocate of what he calls 'voluntary' emigration of Palestinians, said this week that Israel is working to identify countries to take in Palestinians. He also said Israel is preparing a 'very large emigration department' within its Defense Ministry. Here is a closer look at the places the officials say have been approached. Sudan The North African country was among the four Abraham Accord nations that agreed to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020. As part of the deal, the U.S. removed Sudan from its list of state supporters of terrorism, a move that gave the country access to international loans and global legitimacy. But relations with Israel never took off as Sudan plunged into civil war between government forces and the RSF paramilitary group. The conflict has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the U.N. and rights groups. The International Criminal Court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, and then-President Joe Biden’s administration in January said the RSF and its proxies were committing genocide. The U.S. and Israel would be hard-pressed to persuade Palestinians to leave Gaza, particularly to such a troubled country. But they could offer incentives to the Khartoum government, including debt relief, weapons, technology and diplomatic support. Two Sudanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic matter, confirmed that the Trump administration has approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians. One of them said the contacts began even before Trump’s inauguration with offers of military assistance against the RSF, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives. Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. 'This suggestion was immediately rebuffed,' said one official. 'No one opened this matter again.' Military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan told an Arab leaders’ summit last week in Cairo that his country 'categorically rejects' any plan that aims to transfer 'the brotherly Palestinians from their land under whatever justification or name.' Somaliland Somaliland, a territory of over 3 million people in the Horn of Africa, seceded from Somalia over 30 years ago, but it is not internationally recognized as an independent state. Somalia considers Somaliland part of its territory. Somaliland’s new president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, has made international recognition a priority. An American official involved in the efforts confirmed that the U.S. was 'having a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the U.S. in exchange for recognition.' The possibility of U.S. recognition could provide an incentive for Abdullahi to back away from the territory’s solidarity with the Palestinians. The United Arab Emirates, another Abraham Accord country that has developed strong ties with Israel, once had a military base in Somaliland and maintains commercial interests there, including a port. The territory’s strategic location, in the Gulf of Aden waterway near Yemen, home to the Houthi rebel group, could also make it a valuable ally. Over the years, Somaliland has been lauded for its relatively stable political environment, contrasting sharply with Somalia’s ongoing struggles amid deadly attacks by al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab. Since 1991, Somaliland has maintained its own government, currency and security structures. Still, it has one of the lowest income levels in the world. An official in Somaliland, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said his government has not been approached and is not in talks about taking in Palestinians. Somalia Somalia has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians, often hosting peaceful protests on its streets in support of them. The country joined the recent Arab summit that rejected Trump’s plan and seems like an unlikely destination for Palestinians, even if they did agree to move. Sambu Chepkorir, a lawyer and conflict researcher in Nairobi, Kenya, said it is difficult to understand why Somalia would want to host Palestinians given the country’s strong support for Palestinian self-rule. 'The realignments keep changing, and so maybe there is a hidden agenda,' Chepkorir said. A Somali official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the country had not been approached about taking in Palestinians from Gaza and there had been no discussions about it. ___ The post US and Israel look to Africa for resettling Palestinians uprooted from Gaza - AP appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/us-and-israel-look-to-africa-for-resettling-palestinians-uprooted-from-gaza-ap/	2025-03-14T04:59:13-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sudan-64.jpg

Syria calls for ‘independent committee’ to look into its own civi...	The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has stated that 'Syrian government forces and their allies' are responsible for the slaughter of Syrian civilians. By Christine Williams, FrontPage Magazine As Fox News recently pointed out, 'Tulsi Gabbard’s warning to Senate on Syria proves prophetic as Al Qaeda-linked regime slaughters minorities.' Now the big lie about the new 'moderate' leadership of Syria has been exposed in full view of the entire world. The Arab League is now resorting to using vague and deceptive language to cover up its full support for jihadist Syrian leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, aka Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa. It is blaming 'foreign interventions' while expressing vague 'concern over security developments in Syria’s coastal region,' following 'clashes.' The Arab League stands unequivocally with al-Sharaa, inviting him to Cairo for a critical Egypt-led summit on Gaza. The reaction of Muslim leaders to the mass slaughter in Syria exposes how many Islamic countries engage in collusive deception on a routine basis. For instance, on the very day of October 7, 2023, the Saudis, Qatar and Iran stood in unison to blame Israel’s 'occupation,' showing the world exactly where they stood all along. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is the leader of a nation that is a NATO member, boosted al-Sharaa, the former leader of the al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra Front, to power, along with his jihad terrorist forces. Turkey has 'operated alongside' Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in northern Syria, while the Syrian National Army is a Turkish proxy. Turkey has thousands of its troops in northern Syria, and backs its proxy forces there, which have clashed and continue to clash with the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Turkey sees the SDF as 'an extension of its domestic nemesis, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).' At Tulsi Gabbard’s Senate confirmation hearing, she stated: I have no love for Assad or any dictator. I just hate al-Qaeda. I hate that our leaders cozy up to Islamist extremists, calling them 'rebels,' as Jake Sullivan said to Hillary Clinton, 'al Qaeda is on our side in Syria.' Syria is now controlled by al-Qaeda offshoot HTS, led by an Islamist Jihadist who danced in the streets on 9/11, and who was responsible for the killing of many American soldiers. In December, Turkey urged the world to remove Syrian jihadis (i.e. HTS and SDF) from terror lists, and denied Trump’s assertion of an 'unfriendly takeover.' Syrian and global opponents of Bashar al-Assad celebrated the new regime, while seemingly oblivious to what should have been the obvious: that minorities under the new jihadist leadership were in imminent danger, despite the fake reassurances of al-Sharaa. And it didn’t take long. Yet despite the latest slaughter, al-Sharaa continues his charade for fools. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has stated that 'Syrian government forces and their allies' are responsible for the slaughter of Syrian civilians. But the brutal 'Syrian presidency' is distancing itself from the slaughter. It stated that it has formed an 'independent committee' to investigate the attacks on Alawites, the group to which Syria’s former leader Bashar al-Assad belongs. Syria’s defense ministry is also saying that it has concluded a 'major security operation,' following 'days of violence and mass killings' that saw the murder of over 1,500 Alawites, as well as Christians, Druze and Yazidis. It is no secret that murderous regimes always say that they are operating under the banner of 'security,' as they target civilians who do not support their government and then lie about it. Syria will do anything to cover up its human rights abuses in support of al-Sharaa, and so will the Islamic leadership of other countries which support al-Sharaa. In the midst of the current Syrian slaughter of minorities, Erdogan has stated that 'Turkey will continue to stand by the Syrian people and their administration.' Erdogan is also trying to avoid any Western fallout. Muslim leaders have carefully managed the West — from the Muslim Brotherhood and the countries that support it (notably Qatar and Turkey) to the Arab League and the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation. In other words, Islamic leaders have continued to play the West for fools in the decades following 9/11. A month ago, the European Commission gave $254,000,000 to al-Sharaa. European leaders have also backed an Arab proposal for Gaza over Trump’s plan. As if that weren’t enough, it remains to be seen whether these two X posts bear truth… The BBC gave al-Sharaa favorable coverage when he became the leader of Syria, and it continues to present al-Sharaa as magically transformed into a moderate leader. The BBC has made no changes in view of the fallout it experienced after presenting Hamas in a favorable light. Europe and the UK bought into the big lie that al-Sharaa was benign, and they may well continue to support him once the latest slaughter is out of the news cycle. America would have followed suit under a Kamala Harris administration, as Biden sent billions to Afghanistan, claiming that the money wouldn’t go to the Taliban (it did). The Biden administration also poured billions more into coffers of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Islam throughout its history divides the world in two: dar al harb (the House of War) and dar al Islam (the House of Islam). Yet despite the truth that has been continuously on full display, willfully blind leftist leaders in the West continue to call Islam a religion of peace, to their own peril. While the Arab League continues to support the Syrian regime that Turkey helped come to power, the West will likely continue to be manipulated by Muslim countries via calculated propaganda. If 9/11 and 10/7 didn’t wake the West up, what will?

Leaders from Judea and Samaria Visit UAE on historic trip to stre...	Yesha Council chief: 'Our visit to the UAE is proof of the regional shift and the need for fresh thinking.' By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner A delegation of Israeli leaders from the West Bank visited the United Arab Emirates this week on their first trip organized by the Yesha Council—an umbrella organization of municipal councils of Jewish settlements in the West Bank—to a Muslim country, in an effort to foster new alliances, the organization announced Thursday. During the visit to Abu Dhabi, Yesha Council chief Israel Ganz, CEO Omer Rahamim, and Hebron Hills Regional Council head Eliram Azulay met with government officials, business leaders, influencers, and the Jewish state’s envoy to the country, Yossi Shelley. According to local media, the Yesha Council representatives engaged in 'direct discussions about economic and political opportunities in the region.' 'Our visit to the UAE is proof of the regional shift and the need for fresh thinking,' Yesha Council chief said in a statement. 'A new world order requires new alliances and out-of-the-box thinking,' Ganz continued. 'Cooperation between nations, based on mutual respect and recognition of reality, is the key to strengthening our communities and securing a strong future for both countries.' They also met with Ali Rashid al-Nuaimi, a member of the Emirates Federal National Council and chairman of its committee on defense, interior, and foreign affairs. 'This is a first step toward fruitful collaborations that will benefit the entire region,' Ganz said. Upon returning from the trip, Hebron Hills Regional Council head said it was 'incredible to see courageous leaders' who are interested in the development of Judea and Samaria. 'I met leaders who share our fight against Hamas, Hezbollah, the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran, including their civilian arms operating in Judea and Samaria,' Azulay said. 'These leaders are not afraid to say openly that we must combat the Palestinian Authority’s education system, which promotes evil and hatred of Jews.' 'The direct connection established between our communities and senior figures in the UAE opens new opportunities for implementing the Abraham Accords in Judea and Samaria,' he continued. Despite the war in Gaza, both diplomatic and economic ties between Israel and the UAE have remained strong. Last year, annual Israel-UAE trade was reportedly projected to reach a record $3.3 billion compared to $2.95 billion in 2023. Trade is mainly centered on diamonds, with precious stones being the largest exports between the two nations in 2022 and 2023. In 2022, Israel strengthened its defense ties with the UAE by agreeing to sell the SPYDER air defense system, made by the Israeli company Rafael.

Netanyahu calls UN Gaza report an ‘anti-Israel circus’ that ignor...	The Prime Minister also called the UN Human Rights Council an 'antisemitic, corrupt, terrorist-supporting and irrelevant body.' By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday strongly rejected the United Nations Human Rights Council’s report accusing Israel of committing 'genocidal acts' in Gaza. He dismissed the council as an 'anti-Israel circus' that has been 'exposed as an antisemitic, corrupt, terrorist-supporting and irrelevant body.' Netanyahu emphasized that Israel withdrew from the council a month ago due to its bias and accused the U.N. of ignoring Hamas’s war crimes, including the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, which he described as the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust. Instead of addressing Hamas’s crimes against humanity, he argued, the U.N. has 'once again [chosen] to attack the State of Israel with false accusations, including baseless charges of sexual violence.' He concluded with a direct condemnation of the council: 'This is not the Human Rights Council, this is the Council of Blood Rights,' the prime minister said. Gideon Sa’ar, the Jewish state’s foreign minister, called the report 'one of the worst blood libels the world has ever seen,' speaking during a joint press conference with his Greek and Cypriote counterparts on Thursday. 'It accuses the victims of the crimes committed against them. Hamas is the organization that has committed horrific sexual crimes against Israelis on October 7. It is indeed a sick publication that only an antisemitic organization could produce,' he said in Athens. The report was submitted to the Human Rights Council on Thursday. Anne Herzberg, legal adviser and U.N. representative for NGO Monitor commented on the report from the U.N.’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which accused Israel of systematically destroying women’s healthcare facilities in Gaza and using sexual violence as a war strategy since Oct. 7, 2023. 'This latest report yet again reveals the U.N. Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry against Israel as a main vector of atrocity denial and inversion,' Herzberg said. 'Since October 7, the COI [Commission of Inquiry] has outrageously accused Israel of committing crimes against humanity in Gaza while refusing to say the same about Hamas. It also downplayed the mass sexual violence committed on October 7 against Israeli women and girls, while now issuing an entire report dedicated to defaming the IDF with the false claim of perpetrating systematic gender-based violence against Palestinians. 'Moreover, the COI has done zero advocacy to free the hostages, while just this week held another two days of anti-Israel propaganda hearings. We hope the new U.S. administration will cut all funding to the U.N. bodies responsible for providing millions of dollars to this egregious panel and that all countries of conscience will swiftly follow suit,' Herzberg said.

Defying ICC arrest warrant, Netanyahu plans state visit to Hungar...	Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban invited Netanyahu in November shortly after the ICC issued an arrest warrant against him. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to make a state visit to Hungary in the coming weeks in defiance of the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant against him. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban invited Netanyahu in November shortly after the ICC issued an arrest warrant against him and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza. Although Hungary as a member of the European Union is theoretically bound by the ICC directives, Orban told Netanyahu that the warrant for his arrest 'would not be observed' if he came to Hungary. Hungarian Prime Ministers office representative, Gergely Gulyas announced, 'According to current plans, the visit will take place before Easter. Once the date is confirmed, we will announce it, keeping in mind the crucial security considerations involved.' A number of other European leaders said Netanyahu would be arrested if he came to their countries. Assuring Netanyahu that his visit to Hungary would pose no risks, Orban called the arrest warrants a 'brazen, cynical, and completely unacceptable decision.' Known for his frequent disagreements with EU leaders, Orban has developed a close relationship with Netanyahu. 'Today, I will invite Israel’s Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, to visit Hungary, and in that invitation, I will guarantee that if he comes, the ICC ruling will have no effect in Hungary, and we will not adhere to its provisions,' Orban stated. The ICC, lacking its own police force to carry out arrests, has limited diplomatic means to compel countries to act if they choose not to. Among the EU states committed to honoring their ICC obligations are the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Finland, Portugal, Slovenia, and Ireland. Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris told RTE radio that Netanyahu would be arrested if he set foot in Ireland. 'Yes, absolutely. We support international courts and enforce their warrants,' Harris affirmed. Cyprus, which maintains close ties with Israel, regards the warrants as binding in principle, according to a government source who spoke to Reuters The post Defying ICC arrest warrant, Netanyahu plans state visit to Hungary appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/defying-icc-arrest-warrant-netanyahu-plans-state-visit-to-hungary/	2025-03-13T14:29:21-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/F180719MISPOOL06-scaled.jpg
Muslim groups blast Trump for denigrating senator by calling him ...	Trump: 'Schumer is a Palestinian as far as I’m concerned. He’s become a Palestinian. He used to be Jewish. He’s not Jewish anymore. He’s a Palestinian.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Muslim groups criticized US President Donald Trump for referring to Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer as a 'Palestinian.' They took issue with the use of 'Palestinian' as an implied slur. Some Jewish groups were upset that Trump was apparently questioning Schumer's Jewish identity. Trump made the comments in the Oval Office during a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin, who is pro-Palestinian. The US president said, 'Schumer is a Palestinian as far as I’m concerned. He’s become a Palestinian. He used to be Jewish. He’s not Jewish anymore. He’s a Palestinian.' These remarks echo comments Trump made about the senator in August when he questioned his support for Israel. At a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed Schumer was a 'proud member' of Hamas. 'He fell in line,' Trump said of the New York Democrat. 'Schumer refused to shake the Israeli prime minister’s hand.' 'Chuck Schumer has become a Palestinian. Yes, he has. Can you believe it. He has become a proud member of Hamas.' In response to Trump's remarks in the Oval Office, Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said, 'President Trump’s use of the term ‘Palestinian’ as a racial slur is offensive and beneath the dignity of his office.' Awad added that Trump was engaged in the 'continuing dehumanization' of Palestinians with his rhetoric. The Anti-Defamation League criticized Trump's remarks about Schumer, and said, 'A President has many powers, but none of them include deciding who is and isn’t Jewish. Doing so, and using ‘Palestinian’ as a slur, are both beneath any POTUS. Instead of weaponizing people’s identity, use the power of the bully pulpit to bring the American people together.' Jonathan Jacoby, who leads the Nexus Project, an antisemitism watchdog, said, 'Trump’s attack on Schumer is antisemitic and racist. He’s policing Jewish identity, invoking the dual loyalty trope, and implying Palestinians are evil. This is dangerous incitement.

Elon Musk retweets claim that Stalin, Hitler didn’t kill millions...	The retweeted post read, 'Stalin, Mao, and Hitler didn't murder millions of people. Their public sector employees did.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Tech billionaire Elon Musk shared a tweet alleging that public sector employees, and not Hitler, Stalin and Mao Zedong, were responsible for killing millions of people. The retweeted post read, 'Stalin, Mao, and Hitler didn't murder millions of people. Their public sector employees did.' The context of the retweet was Musk's belief that the public sector is over-funded and his proposal to dramatically reduce the number of civil servants. However, there is a widespread feeling that Musk was minimizing historical atrocities committed by the three autocrats. The original poster added context to their tweet, saying that individuals who testified at the Nuremberg trial, rather than Hitler, were responsible for their crimes. They tweeted, 'After the Nuremberg trials, the so-called 'superior orders' defense – 'I was just following orders' – is considered invalid under international law. Individual rather than collective responsibility for your actions is enshrined in law.' This isn't the first time Musk has created controversy regarding expressed attitudes towards Nazism and the Holocaust. In January, Musk addressed a gathering of a right-wing German party, calling on Germans to look beyond the national guilt associated with the Holocaust and embrace 'German pride.' In his video message, Musk emphasized 'that people take pride in Germany and being German.' Speaking just two days before International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Musk appeared to reference the legacy of the Holocaust, telling attendees that in Germany 'there is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that.' 'Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great grandparents.' 'We need to look at the future of Germany with optimism and enthusiasm. It’s important to be proud of German culture and values. It’s about preserving German culture and protecting the German people. Convince people to vote AfD.' The Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party Musk was endorsing has a history of antisemitic rhetoric and has generated significant controversy over its perceived white nationalist element within the party. Musk was thought by many to have given a Nazi salute at US President Donald Trump's inauguration and made Holocaust jokes to mock the controversy. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Musk by saying he was 'a great friend to Israel.'

Authors of Project 2025 propose gradual end to U.S. military aid ...	By 2039, Israel would begin buying American weapons directly instead of receiving them through congressional aid packages. By Jewish Breaking News After making headlines for its controversial Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation issued a new proposal on Wednesday that would have been unthinkable in conservative circles just years ago. Titled 'From Special Relationship to Strategic Partnership,' it outlines a precise twenty-year transition in U.S.-Israel relations. The plan would increase military financing to $4 billion annually beginning in fiscal 2029. Then in 2032, that aid would start decreasing by $250 million each year until it ends completely in 2047, just before Israel celebrates its 100th birthday. 'Israel will then be positioned to celebrate its 100th anniversary as an independent and full partner to the U.S. Just as Israel once advanced from a financial assistance recipient to an economic partner of the United States, so, too, should it move from a military financing recipient to a security partner,' the report argues. By 2039, Israel would begin buying American weapons directly instead of receiving them through congressional aid packages. Prior to the Hamas massacre against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, unwavering support for Israeli military aid has for the most part transcended partisan divisions in Washington, particularly among Republicans who have made it a cornerstone of their party platform. But the authors are framing their recommendation not as an abandonment but rather as an 'evolution toward a strategic partnership.' Rather than continuing direct payments, American support would be redirected toward 'cooperative programs' that include strengthened trade partnerships, collaborative defense research, and unified sanctions against regional threats.

By Jewish Breaking News Israeli flag carrier El Al has certainly had a good year in a market virtually devoid of competition on North American routes. Throughout 2024, El Al commanded a staggering 47.5% of all passenger traffic at Ben Gurion Airport, nearly doubling its pre-war market share. As a result, the airline’s net profit exploded to $545 million, a jaw-dropping 4.7 times higher than 2023 figures. The company’s fourth quarter alone netted $130 million, and overall cash flow has ballooned to $1.4 billion. Despite blatant market dominance, El Al vehemently rejects criticism of its wartime fare hikes, insisting average price increases were 'only' 14% per passenger. The company points to token gestures of fixed fares on select European routes: $199 to Larnaca, $299 to Athens, and $349 to Dubai, Vienna, and Frankfurt. However, these modest concessions do little to address the exorbitant fares to North America, where Israelis and American Jews face severely limited options. El Al’s own figures admit their revenue per available seat kilometer surged 24% in 2024, fueled by an extraordinary 94% seat occupancy. Discussing the airline’s extraordinary seat occupancy with Globes, CEO Ben Tal Ganancia brushed off concerns with a joke that the unfilled seats were 'apparently because we made a mistake somewhere in the count.' Considering the NIS 6.3 million compensation package she just received, Ganancia could certainly afford flippant jokes about counting errors. While Israelis paid premium prices amid limited travel options, the CEO’s pay jumped 10% in 2024, including a NIS 3.6 million bonus atop her NIS 2.3 million salary and NIS 600,000 in stock compensation. Chairman Ben-Zvi fared even better with a 29% increase in salary to NIS 5.4 million. Though still unable to distribute dividends due to government bailout restrictions from the COVID era, El Al now sits on $654 million in distributable profits. Meanwhile, the company has ambitious targets of $4 billion revenue by 2030, betting that the global aircraft shortage will maintain their advantageous market position.

Lawyer for radical Columbia grad student repped Al Qaeda members—...	Like his new client, Kassem was also involved in anti-Israel activism as a student at Columbia, where he lobbied to rename a sandwich called the 'Israeli wrap' in the student dining hall, claiming the terminology was offensive to Muslims. By Alana Goodman, The Washington Free Beacon When Hamas-supporting Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil appeared in court on Wednesday, he was represented by, among others, Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer perhaps best known for defending al Qaeda terrorists. The Syrian-born Khalil had his green card revoked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement over the weekend as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on foreign nationals involved in pro-terrorist demonstrations at universities. Kassem has represented terrorists including Ahmed al-Darbi, an al Qaeda member convicted in 2017 for the bombing of a French oil tanker, as well as several other Guantanamo Bay detainees, including a 'close associate' of Osama bin Laden. He went on to serve as an immigration policy adviser to former president Joe Biden as a member of the White House's Domestic Policy Council. Like his new client, Kassem was also involved in anti-Israel activism as a student at Columbia, where he lobbied to rename a sandwich called the 'Israeli wrap' in the student dining hall, claiming the terminology was offensive to Muslims. He attended Columbia Law School on a fellowship funded by Paul Soros, the elder brother of Democratic megadonor George Soros. His client, Khalil, who graduated from a Columbia graduate program in December, was a leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest, which backed Hamas's 'armed resistance' against Israel. He served as a lead negotiator for student activists' illegal anti-Israel encampment last spring and vowed that the group would 'remain in this encampment until we achieve all of our demands,' which included a boycott of Israel. Columbia briefly suspended Khalil for his role in the encampment, but he continued to back the demonstrations on campus, which turned violent in the spring, when students stormed and occupied campus building. 'What we will see [is] the students will continue their activism, will continue doing what they've done in conventional and unconventional ways,' Khalil told The Hill in August. 'So not only protests, not only encampments, kind of any—any available means necessary to push Columbia to divest from Israel.' 'And we've been working all this summer on our plans, on what's next to pressure Columbia to listen to the students and to decide to be on the right side of history,' Khalil went on. Since then, pro-Hamas activists at Columbia have disrupted classes to distribute anti-Semitic flyers, violently seized campus buildings, and physically assaulted university employees. The chaos led the Trump administration last week to cut off $400 million in federal grants to the university, citing the school's 'continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.' President Donald Trump said Khalil's green card revocation was the first 'of many to come.' Khalil is expected to remain in the country after a federal judge, Jesse Furman, intervened on Wednesday to block his immediate deportation. Furman, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, is a prolific Democratic donor who once threw out a terrorism lawsuit against the Palestine Liberation Organization. Furman, who has served as a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York since he was nominated in 2011 by President Barack Obama, has a long history of involvement with liberal political causes. The brother of Obama’s former economic advisor Jason Furman, Jesse Furman has donated over $20,000 to Democrats, including Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic National Committee. Furman also served as the treasurer of his family’s charity, the Furman Foundation, which has donated to Media Matters, the Alliance for Justice, and People for the American Way, according to his Senate confirmation questionnaire. The Khalil ruling isn’t the first time Furman has staked out a controversial position on a case involving Israel. In 2018, Furman dismissed a terrorism lawsuit against the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian leadership in Judea and Samaria, citing a lack of jurisdiction. The lawsuit was filed by the family of Ari Fuld, an American-Israeli citizen who was stabbed to death by a Palestinian terrorist outside an Israeli shopping center in 2018. The plaintiffs argued that the PLO and Palestinian Authority were liable in Fuld’s murder under the Anti-Terrorism Act, because the Palestinian government paid the terrorist’s family following the attack. Critics say this payment system, known as the 'pay-to-slay' program, incentivizes terrorism. Furman tossed the suit, arguing that the court didn’t have jurisdiction over the PLO and the Palestinian Authority. But Fuld’s family and other victims of Palestinian terrorism have appealed the issue, and the Supreme Court agreed to take up the question of jurisdiction in December. In Khalil’s case, the government is challenging the Southern District’s jurisdiction over the case, arguing that Khalil's lawyers should have filed it in either New Jersey or Louisiana, where Khalil was detained at the time. Ted Frank, the director of the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute, told the Washington Free Beacon that there is a strong argument for challenging the jurisdiction and that he would be 'surprised if the motion isn't granted.' Khalil's lawyers countered that there is legal standing to file his case in the place where he was arrested, if there is evidence that the government transferred him to prevent him from speaking with legal counsel. 'There is a two-track process here: habeas corpus (in federal court) and deportation (before an immigration judge),' Andrew McCarthy, a former prosecutor in the Southern District and columnist for National Review, told the Free Beacon. 'The issue in the habeas case is whether Khalil's arrest and detention violate the Constitution.'

Ilhan Omar’s daughter promotes fundraiser for pro-Hamas activist ...	The funds will go toward Khalil’s legal defense, secure bail if he becomes eligible for release, assist his family, and cover medical expenses. By Jessica Costescu, The Washington Free Beacon Isra Hirsi, the daughter of 'Squad' member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.), championed a fundraiser supporting Mahmoud Khalil, the student activist and foreign national facing deportation by the Trump administration over his pro-Hamas campus organizing. The online fundraiser was launched after ICE took Khalil into custody Saturday night after the State Department revoked his visa and green card. By Wednesday afternoon, the fundraiser had raised nearly $270,000, surpassing its $250,000 goal and prompting administrators to set a new target of $500,000. Hirsi, a far-left activist, anti-Israel agitator, and Barnard College senior, posted a screenshot of the fundraiser with a link to the webpage on her Instagram story Tuesday afternoon, which at the time had raised about $115,000. The money 'will help Mahmoud and his family’s urgent and evolving needs as we work to secure his release and support his family during this incredibly difficult time,' according to the fundraising page. The funds will go toward Khalil’s legal defense, secure bail if he becomes eligible for release, assist his family, and cover medical expenses. They will also bankroll 'long-term justice efforts' to 'hold those responsible for his unlawful detention accountable.' The fundraiser ends by noting, 'Mahmoud has dedicated his life to fighting for justice. Now, he needs us to fight for him. Let’s stand together and bring him home.' On Monday, a New York judge temporarily halted Khalil’s deportation proceedings while the federal court hears a petition challenging his arrest. In the petition, Khalil asserted that there was 'no basis' for his arrest and subsequent detention. Judge Jesse Furman on Wednesday directed attorneys for both parties to submit a joint letter on Friday outlining further plans for arguments in the case. Hirsi posted another Instagram story throwing shade at university faculty who remained silent following Khalil’s arrest. She shared a post saying 'the academic cowers' and added the caption, 'if you are wondering where our esteemed faculty are … shameful behavior.' Hirsi has a history of taking radical positions, becoming heavily involved in the anti-Israel movement after Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack. She has participated in protests at Columbia University, Barnard’s sister school, and was arrested and suspended in April after refusing to vacate an illegal encampment on the Ivy League school’s campus. Alongside Khalil, Hirsi is an organizer with Columbia University Apartheid Divest and with Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine, two student groups that have endorsed 'armed resistance' and praised terrorists. Both groups also led the recent storming of two Barnard campus buildings, during which radical activists disseminated Hamas pamphlets and clashed with security guards, sending one to the hospital. Video footage placed Khalil at the most recent building storming. Following her suspension, Hirsi complained in a Teen Vogue interview that she was left homeless and without food. On the first anniversary of Hamas’s attack that killed over 1,000 Israelis, Hirsi posted a picture to her Instagram account with the caption, 'Resistance is glorious, we will be victorious.' In October, the Washington Free Beacon reported that Hirsi, whose parents are Somali immigrants, had received 'reparations' payments from her white friends on Juneteenth nearly every year since 2019. Reparations advocates typically push for payments to descendants of African Americans enslaved in the United States, while Juneteenth commemorates the nation’s 1865 end of slavery. Hirsi did not respond to a request for comment. Anti-Israel agitators in New York, meanwhile, clashed with police Tuesday during a heated protest against Khalil’s detention, leading to several arrests. The demonstration was part of a coordinated nationwide walkout by students and faculty at elite colleges across the country. Among the crowd was Aidan Parisi, a Columbia graduate student who was arrested last spring for storming Hamilton Hall and suspended for his role in an event featuring terror-tied speakers who called for violence against Jews. Also present was Maryam Iqbal, a Barnard student and vocal anti-Israel activist, who was arrested alongside Parisi during last spring’s illegal encampments at Columbia. At Columbia, a smaller crowd of about 40 faculty and students walked out of their classes and assembled outside the Low Memorial Library. The protesters called out the interim Columbia president, chanting, 'We will never let this slide, Katrina Armstrong you can’t hide' and 'Katrina Armstrong what do you say, how many boots did you lick today.' In a Wednesday statement, Armstrong reiterated her support for all Columbia students. 'I stand by my students, all of my students. I support their right to express their views and to participate in open and respectful dialogue and debate,' she said. 'I feel the same responsibility for the wellbeing of all Columbia students as I do for my patients as their doctor. There is nothing more important to me.

Report: Trump drops Adam Boehler as hostage envoy following Israe...	Republican sources say Trump's envoy appointed to handle the issue of the Gaza hostages has been removed, after revelations of his secret talks with Hamas terrorists sparked a backlash from Israel. By World Israel News Staff Adam Boehler, President Donald Trump's envoy leading efforts to secure the return of hostages held captive in the Gaza Strip, has been removed from his position, according to a report Thursday. Citing three Republican officials, the Jewish Insider reported that President Trump dropped Boehler, just 52 days after taking on the role of Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. The Trump administration has reportedly informed Jerusalem of the change. Last week, Axios revealed that Boehler had initiated secret talks with Hamas terrorists in Doha, Qatar, aimed at securing the return of the five Americans held captive in Gaza. Only one of the five is believed to still be alive. Following the report, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, excoriated Boehler during a phone call, criticizing the lack of Israeli consent to the talks and Boehler's failure to even notify Israel. In the days following the call, Boehler launched a public relations blitz, appearing on a number of American and Israeli news outlets. However, Republican officials cited in Thursday's report called Boehler's interviews 'unproductive.' 'It's like he's in Never Never Land,' one Republican senator said of the envoy. A number of Republican lawmakers have reportedly sought Boehler's ouster from the administration. 'I don’t know why we’d be interested in him doing anything going forward after what we saw,' one said. Boehler, 51, who met Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner in college, served in the first Trump administration, with a tenure as Director for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2018 to 2019, before being appointed CEO of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. In 2020, Boehler was also tapped to take part in the diplomatic efforts culminating in the Abraham Accords.

Israel Aerospace Industries reports record earnings in 2024	Net income surged 55% to $493 million, while its order backlog hit a record $25 billion, securing four years of operations. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) reported record earnings in 2024 according to its financial report released on Thursday. The state-owned defense contractor said the year’s revenue reached $6.11 billion, a 15% increase from 2023. 'The financial statements underpin the faith that our customers and partners have in the Company’s operations and the state-of-the-art systems which it develops from the perspective of the future battlefield. I wish to thank our customers and partners for their cooperation and vote of confidence in Israel’s technological leadership,' said IAI President and CEO Boaz Levy. IAI’s success stems from Israel’s increased defense spending during the past year’s war with Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran and its proxies while Russia’s war in Ukraine sparked a surge in European contracts. IAI is perhaps best-known for its Arrow missile defense system. Since Hamas’s October 7 attack, the Houthis have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel. The majority have been intercepted before reaching Israeli airspace. Net income surged 55% to $493 million, while its order backlog hit a record $25 billion, securing four years of operations. Military sales drove growth, with exports comprising 66% of total revenue. The financial performance was driven by sales in its Military Groups division, which grew by 15.5% to $5.19 billion. The Aviation Group also saw an increase in sales, rising by 6.4% to $1.48 billion. Export sales accounted for 66% of total revenue, totaling $4.03 billion, while domestic sales rose to $2.08 billion, reflecting a greater share of the company’s revenue compared to 2023. According to the financial statements, IAI’s order backlog reached an all-time high of approximately $25 billion, ensuring around four years of operational activity. This represents a significant increase from the $18 billion backlog recorded at the end of 2023. The company’s sales rose to $6.11 billion in 2024, up from $5.33 billion in the previous year, an increase of about 15%. IAI also reported a sharp rise in profitability, with net income surging by 55% to $493 million compared to $318 million in 2023. The company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) climbed 19% to $792 million, while operating income grew 32% to $498 million. Gross profit for the year stood at $1.14 billion, reflecting a $174 million increase from 2023. The company’s positive cash flow from operating activities surged to $2.72 billion in 2024, compared with $889 million in 2023. IAI also reported investing $387 million in in-house R&D, with $333 million carried as expenses, up from $342 million and $275 million, respectively, in 2023. The fourth quarter of 2024 also saw strong performance, with sales totaling $1.72 billion, an 18% increase from the same period in 2023. However, net income for Q4 dipped slightly to $77 million from $79 million the previous year. Said Levy, '2024 was entirely managed alongside unprecedented fighting in Israel, and IAI faced numerous global challenges that affected its performance. I am deeply grateful to IAI’s employees for their relentless efforts to meet enhanced supply quotas to guarantee the satisfaction of our customers and meet our obligations for the success of the entire company.'

Israeli Arab arrested for helping ISIS-linked terrorists	He allegedly provided intelligence on security forces’ movements, including photographing Israeli troops en route to Tulkarem and transmitting the information via Telegram. By Pesach Benson, TPS An Israeli national is due to be indicted for terrorist activities linked to the Islamic State (ISIS), Israeli authorities cleared for publication on Thursday. The suspect was identified as Kamel Nashef, a 21-year-old resident of the Israeli-Arab city of Taiba. Investigators said Nashef began consuming ISIS propaganda online in mid-2024 and subsequently made contact with operatives affiliated with the organization. He later swore allegiance to ISIS and considered himself a member of the group. Authorities seized incriminating materials tied to the terrorist organization during his arrest. According to the indictment, Nashef sought to retaliate against Israel over the war in Gaza. He allegedly provided intelligence on security forces’ movements, including photographing Israeli troops en route to Tulkarem and transmitting the information via the Telegram messaging app. The intelligence was intended to assist terrorists prepare for the arrival of Israeli forces.

UN report accuses IDF of genocide and rape in Gaza	Anti-Israel circus' - Israel lambasts United Nations as 'antisemitic,' calls latest allegations of genocide and sexual assault a 'blood libel.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A United Nations report published Thursday accused Israeli soldiers of committing rape and other forms of sexual assault against Gazans while the IDF adhered to 'genocidal' policies against Palestinian Arabs in the coastal enclave. The report was drafted by the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, a body established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021, following the conflict that year between Israel and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in the Gaza Strip. 'Israeli authorities have destroyed in part the reproductive capacity of the Palestinians in Gaza as a group, including by imposing measures intended to prevent births, one of the categories of genocidal acts in the Rome Statute and the Genocide Convention,' the commission argued in its report. Israel's sealing of the border after October 7th and restrictions on the entry of goods into Gaza, including a period of 'total siege,' were among the examples of alleged genocide claimed by the commission. 'The Commission finds that the [Israel security forces] controlled the entry, the content and the amounts of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza and that the ISF deliberately stopped humanitarian assistance which included items essential for pregnant women, new mothers and newborns from reaching Gaza, both through direct attacks and through the imposition of a total siege.' The commission also claimed to have documented 'cases of rape and sexual assault' of male terror suspects held by Israel. The examples cited included the case of a Hamas terrorist from the elite Nukhba Force who accused Israeli soldiers working as guards at the Sde Teiman detention center of sexually assaulting him. An attorney representing the soldiers, who are currently facing an investigation into the alleged abuse, said the terrorist in question had injured himself while attempting to smuggle a miniature cell phone in his rectum, and assaulted the accused soldiers after they confronted him. The commission is chaired by Navi Pillay, a South African jurist accused in the past of anti-Israel bias, following her involvement in the 2001 Durban Conference and the Goldstein Report. In 2022, she came under fire for defending commission member Miloon Kothari after he denied Israel's right to be in the UN and claimed that social media platforms were under Jewish control. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu excoriated the commission and the UN Human Rights Council, calling the latter 'antisemitic' and accusing it of supporting terrorism. 'The anti-Israel circus known as the UN 'Human Rights Council' has long been revealed as an antisemitic, rotten and irrelevant organization that supports terrorism. For good reason Israel decided to quit it approximately one month ago.' 'Instead of focusing on the crimes against humanity and the war crimes that were perpetrated by the Hamas terrorist organization in the worst massacre carried out against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, the UN has again chosen to attack the State of Israel with false accusations, including baseless accusations of sexual violence.' 'This is not a human rights council; it is a blood rights council.' The Israeli Foreign Ministry called Thursday's report a 'blood libel' and a 'sick document.' 'It is one of the worst cases of blood libel the world has ever seen (and the world has seen many).' 'It accuses the victims of the crimes committed against them. Hamas is the organization that has committed horrendous sexual crimes against Israelis. It is indeed a sick document that only an antisemitic organization such as the UN could produce.'

Arab foreign ministers meet with Witkoff on Cairo’s Gaza plan	A statement issued after the meeting emphasized the ministers’ commitment to consolidating the ceasefire in Gaza alongside efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace based on a two-state solution. By Joshua Marks, JNS The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Egypt met with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff in Doha, Qatar on Wednesday to discuss Egypt’s Gaza reconstruction plan. The discussions also covered the establishment of an administrative committee to manage the Strip. According to reports from Saudi outlets Al Arabiya and Al Hadath, Hussein al-Sheikh, secretary-general of the PLO Executive Committee, also attended the meeting. A picture purportedly of the meeting, including al-Sheikh, was circulating on social media and posted to X by Kan News Arab affairs correspondent Roi Kas. שרי החוץ הערבים עם וויטקוף בדוחה, גם מזכ'ל הוועד הפועל של אש'ף, חוסיין א-שייח' pic.twitter.com/KhZFh1rCwv &mdash; roi kais • روعي كايس • רועי קייס (@kaisos1987) March 12, 2025 The participants agreed to continue consultations and coordination with the United States regarding the Egyptian initiative, which was formally adopted during the Arab Summit in Cairo on March 4. A statement issued after the meeting emphasized the ministers’ commitment to consolidating the ceasefire in Gaza alongside efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace based on a two-state solution. The talks also addressed mobilizing funding for Gaza’s reconstruction, particularly in light of Egypt’s planned international donor conference, organized in collaboration with the United Nations and the Palestinian government. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel Aty separately met with his Qatari counterpart, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, to discuss further steps toward implementing the reconstruction plan and strengthening the ceasefire. Cairo’s reconstruction initiative was proposed as an alternative to the plan put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump, which involved resettling the Gaza population while the war-torn coastal enclave is rebuilt into a global economic hub—an idea strongly opposed by Cairo, Amman and other regional powers. Meanwhile, Egypt and Qatar, along with the United States, continue their mediation efforts between Hamas and Israel. U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Adam Boehler recently held direct talks with Hamas in an attempt to free the remaining hostages in Gaza, despite long-standing American policy against negotiating with terrorists. The Israeli negotiating delegation prolonged their stay in Doha this week at Witkoff’s request to facilitate continued talks, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned senior coalition members and security chiefs for a security assessment, Ynet reported on Wednesday. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) chief Ronen Bar, Mossad Director David Barnea, National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Defense Minister Israel Katz and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar reportedly joined the prime minister. Israel and the United States initially rejected the Egyptian reconstruction plan for Gaza, while the Hamas terrorist group welcomed the proposal. The Israeli Foreign Ministry sharply criticized the statement issued at the Emergency Summit of the Extraordinary Arab Summit, accusing it of ignoring the realities on the ground following Hamas’s brutal attack on Oct. 7, 2023. 'The statement remains rooted in outdated perspectives,' the ministry said, adding that it 'fails to mention Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, which resulted in thousands of Israeli deaths and hundreds of kidnappings.' Israel also condemned the summit for its failure to denounce Hamas explicitly. The ministry also took aim at continued reliance on the Palestinian Authority and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), organizations it accused of corruption, support for terrorism and failure to resolve the longstanding conflict. 'For 77 years, Arab states have used Palestinians as pawns against Israel, condemning them to eternal ‘refugee’ status,' the statement read. Israel also referenced recent proposals that could offer Gazans a new future, including the idea promoted by Trump. 'There is an opportunity for the Gazans to have free choice based on their free will. This should be encouraged!' the ministry stated. Instead, it accused Arab states of rejecting this opportunity outright while continuing to level 'baseless accusations' against Israel. The statement warned that Hamas’s actions have destabilized the region and that leaving the group in power would prevent any chance of lasting security. 'For the sake of peace and stability, Hamas can’t be left in power,' the ministry said. 'We urge regional states to collaborate in creating a future of stability and security in the region,' the statement concluded. The White House said that Cairo’s Gaza plan does not address the current harsh realities on the ground. 'The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is uninhabitable, and its residents cannot live there humanely when it is covered in rubble and unexploded bombs,' said Brian Hughes, spokesperson for the National Security Council. Hughes also reaffirmed Trump’s stance on Gaza’s future, stating, 'President Trump stands behind his vision to rebuild Gaza without Hamas.' Despite the rejection of the plan, he emphasized that the United States remains open to 'continuing talks' on the issue. The Israel Defense Forces has confirmed that 35 of the hostages still in Gaza are dead. Israeli intelligence believes 22 are alive, while the status of two remains uncertain. Among the captives are five Americans, including 21-year-old Edan Alexander, who is believed to be alive. Hamas led a terrorist invasion of southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, murdering some 1,200 people, wounding thousands more, and kidnapping 251 to Gaza, sparking a regional war.

Israel, Lebanon and possible normalization	While seeking to strengthen moderate elements within Lebanon, Israel remains aware of Hezbollah’s continued presence in the region. By JNS Israel is taking steps toward possible normalization with Lebanon, as diplomatic representatives will replace military officials in upcoming negotiation talks. A diplomatic source confirmed to Israel Hayom on Wednesday that these discussions aim to transition to a political-diplomatic track. Our sources have learned that the next meeting will feature an Israeli diplomatic representative instead of an IDF official, marking an immediate elevation in the talks’ significance. The strategic shift reflects Israel’s desire to bolster the Lebanese president’s position against armed groups in coordination with the U.S., perhaps paving the way for future normalization of relations between the countries. Israeli officials point to significant changes in Lebanon’s internal political landscape, noting that Hezbollah‘s political influence has weakened considerably. But on Wednesday, Lebanon responded to statements made by an Israeli political source who expressed interest in advancing normalization between the countries. Officials in Beirut categorically denied that the indirect dialogue with Jerusalem would lead to normalization. Sources in the Lebanese presidential office told Al-Mayadeen channel that assertions about dialogue committees between Israel and Lebanon serving as a prelude to normalization are unfounded. According to these sources, the three committees established to resolve existing issues with Israel represent a continuation of implementing U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701. The sources emphasized that these committees will not involve direct negotiations between Lebanon and Israel. 'The committees will address longstanding issues—specifically border disputes and points that have remained contentious since 2006,' the officials said. While seeking to strengthen moderate elements within Lebanon, Israel remains aware of Hezbollah’s continued presence in the region. As a security precaution, despite ongoing negotiations, Israel maintains five strategic positions inside Lebanese territory. The discussions surrounding key positions do not automatically mean Israel will relinquish these areas—Israeli negotiators are expected to present their own security demands to protect border communities.

First sign of life received from Hamas hostage Avinatan Or	This is the first sign of life Or’s family has received since his capture on Oct. 7, 2023 alongside his partner Noa Argamani, who was subsequently rescued during an Israeli military operation. By JNS Israel has received the first sign of life regarding Hamas hostage Avinatan Or since his capture by the terrorist group 523 days ago, Hebrew media reported on Wednesday evening. During debriefings of freed hostages who were held in central Gaza, it emerged that several of them had seen Or, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. The freed hostages also described severe detention conditions, being deprived of food and given minimal water. This is the first sign of life Or’s family has received since his capture on Oct. 7, 2023 alongside his partner Noa Argamani, who was subsequently rescued during an Israeli military operation. Avinatan and Argamani were abducted from the Nova music festival near Kibbutz Re’im. Originally published by Israel Hayom.

Israeli lawmakers lobby US Congress to back Jewish right to pray ...	Two government ministers and more than a dozen Knesset members urged the US Congress to back Jewish rights on Temple Mount, including freedom of prayer, along with recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the holy site. By World Israel News Staff Two government ministers and nearly a dozen sitting Members of Knesset, along with several former lawmakers and other public figures, issued a joint call Wednesday to the U.S. Congress, urging American lawmakers to endorse Jewish religious freedom on the Temple Mount, and formally recognize Israel’s historic connection to and sovereignty over the holy site. The initiative, led by the Beyadenu For The Temple Mount and Shofar in Zion organizations, has received the backing of Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi (Likud), and Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar (Likud), along with 13 current and former MKs from the Likud, Religious Zionist Party, and Otzma Yehudit factions. In the letter, the signatories urged Congress to promote a formal declaration recognizing the 'eternal and inalienable right of the Jewish people to the Temple Mount.' 'This is the place where our Temples stood, destroyed by the Babylonian and Roman empires approximately 2,500 and 1,900 years ago.' Despite Israel's commitment to religious freedom, the letter highlights the restrictions on non-Muslim visitors to the Temple Mount. 'While the sovereign State of Israel guarantees access to holy sites for all religions, the Jewish people themselves are denied full and unrestricted access to their holiest site due to immense international pressure. Official recognition from the world’s leading nation and Israel’s greatest ally—the United States—will help neutralize these pressures and ensure historical justice.' In addition to the letter, the activists behind this initiative have been engaged in ongoing discussions with members of both chambers of Congress over the past month, with further meetings scheduled this week. These discussions aim to advance the recognition of Jewish rights to the Temple Mount and build support for a formal congressional declaration on the issue. Israeli Temple Mount activists argue that official U.S. recognition of Israel’s historic ties to the Temple Mount and the importance of protecting Jewish rights there would not be merely symbolic but 'would affirm truth, religious freedom, and historical justice.' 'With Trump’s return, we can correct the international narrative on the Temple Mount and rectify the grave injustice done to the Jewish people,' said Yosef Rabin, Chairman of Shofar in Zion. 'The denial of our religious and national rights to the site must end. This is a modern-day Cyrus moment—we must declare loudly: there is no Zionism without Mount Zion.' In addition to Ministers Karhi and Zohar, the letter was signed by 11 current MKs, two former MKs, Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem Aryeh King, and Yossi Dagan, chairman of the Samaria Regional Council. The current MKs include Dan Illouz, Ariel Kellner, Moshe Pasal, Nissim Vaturi, Hanoch Milwidsky, Keti Shitrit, and Avihai Boaron from the Likud; Simcha Rothman of the Religious Zionist Party, and Otzma Yehudit MKs Limor Son Har-Melech, Yitzhak Kreuzer, and Almog Cohen. Former Likud MKs Moshe Feiglin and Yehudah Glick also signed the letter. 'This letter calls for a natural and just recognition of the Jewish people’s exclusive right to their holiest site,' said Tom Nissani, CEO of Beyadenu For The Temple Mount. 'I am grateful to the ministers and MKs who joined this important cause, and I believe it will resonate internationally. The American administration supports full Israeli sovereignty over the Temple Mount.'

Hamas online promoter accused of pocketing $4 million he raised f...	Condemnation of Salah al-Jafarawi has come from ordinary Gazans and the PA, in whose name he claimed to be fundraising. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A Gazan who has gained fame using his social media skills to promote Hamas ever since the war between Israel and the terrorist organization began, stands accused of embezzling $4 million he ostensibly raised for a Gaza hospital. Salah al-Jafarawi asked his followers online to donate towards the rebuilding of Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, saying that his appeal was being made 'in coordination with the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah and Gaza.' He used the Palestinian Authority (PA) ministry’s logo, as well as that of a Kuwaiti charity, seemingly without the latter’s knowledge, to legitimize his claim of acting in some kind of official capacity. The PA, which pays civil servants in Gaza but has had no say in the running of any governmental functions there since Hamas overthrew it in 2007, quickly denied having anything to do with that campaign or any other private fundraising attempts for Gaza. Gazans reacted furiously online to the news, demanding to know where the millions have gone. Blogger and activist Mustafa Ashfour wrote, 'Salah used his journalistic work and exploited the suffering of our people in Gaza to steal donations&#8230;. It's very easy for him to convince people he's an angel and a journalist, and then plunder money.' 'The Health Ministry in Gaza, controlled by Hamas, backed this thief, not the Palestinian Authority. So, dear donors, your money is gone,' he wrote. Some users defended him by saying that the accusers are linked to Fatah, the movement behind the PA, which hates Hamas and fears its huge popularity in its territory in Judea and Samaria. Al-Jafarawi first got noticed when Israeli media juxtaposed a video clip of him delighting over the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023 and the massacres of Israelis, when the terrorists covered their invasion by firing thousands of missiles over the border. Days later, Al-Jafarawi was seen crying in fear during the start of the Israeli air force’s massive counter-attack. He thus earned the nickname 'Mr. FAFO,' which stands for 'F*** around, find out.' The twenty-five-year-old has starred in many Hamas propaganda videos since then, playing parts such as a father of an injured child, a hospital patient, a Hamas fighter and a displaced person. On various social media platforms, he is alternately listed as an actor, journalist, content creator, media influencer and Palestinian activist. One pro-Hamas website listed him as a 'martyr' for Gaza, albeit without providing a date of death. The Israeli foreign ministry has called him 'just one example of how Hamas is using social media to spread misinformation and shape false narratives related to Gaza.' Meta blocked al-Jafarawi’s Instagram account on Saturday, but he reportedly has already opened a new one.

Toronto police department slams criticism of pro-Hamas demonstrat...	Police spokesman castigate critics of anti-Israel rallies who described events as ‘pro-Hamas,’ claim October 7th invasion led many Canadians to convert to Islam. By World Israel News Staff The Toronto police department apologized Tuesday after two of its spokesmen made controversial comments on an official police podcast earlier this week regarding the impact of the October 7th invasion of Israel, and defended anti-Israel rallies in the wake of the Hamas invasion. This Monday, two spokesmen for the Toronto Police Service – Farhan Ali and Haroon Siddiqui – spoke on an episode of the weekly TPS podcast 'Project Olive Branch.' In the episode, which was released via Instagram, Ali and Siddiqui took aim at the critics of anti-Israel rallies held in Canada following the October 7th massacres, accusing those who described the demonstrations as being 'pro-Hamas' of Islamophobia. 'When someone is calling a Palestinian rally a ‘Hamas rally,’ then all of a sudden people start getting afraid, and they think 'Oh wow these are people supporting an entity that's been labeled as a terrorist organization,' but the people that are protesting are there for another cause altogether.' Siddiqui also appeared to speak favorably of the reaction many had to the October 7th invasion and subsequent war in Gaza, claiming that it inspired many people to convert to Islam. 'Through social media, a lot of people, after October 7, started learning about Islam, and they said what is it with the religion that it is so hated, you know what I mean why are they being attacked all the time?' 'There have been a lot of reverts through this whole process,' Siddiqui continued, using the term 'revert,' which is favored by some Muslims who believe all souls are intrinsically linked to Islam – even if the person is raised in another faith. 'The amount of people reverting to Islam is unbelievable, and I guess through education they’re educating themselves, and saying ‘what [sic] is it that Muslims are being targeted, and why are they being targeted?' Let me learn about this religion, what are these accusations that they are saying.' The Toronto Police Service retracted the podcast a day later, erasing it from the department’s Instagram page. On Tuesday, the TPS issued an apology. 'We acknowledge that a recent episode of our podcast, Project Olive Branch, has caused significant upset and concern in the Jewish community and beyond,' police said via the department’s X account. 'That was not our intention and we apologize. The podcast has been removed.' 'We recognize the Jewish community’s profound pain and anguish as a result of October 7th and the ensuing rise of antisemitism,' said Police Chief Myron Demkiw. 'I have personally heard from the community about the impact of this podcast, and I’m truly sorry. Our commitment to protecting our Jewish communities remains unwavering.'

Israeli moderately wounded in terror shooting near Ariel in Samar...	The injured victim, identified as an 18-year-old male, sustained moderate wounds. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS An Israeli was wounded in a terrorist shooting attack outside the central Samaria city of Ariel on Wednesday night, according to medical officials. The injured victim, identified as an 18-year-old male, sustained moderate wounds and was evacuated to Rabin Medical Center’s Beilinson Hospital in the central Israeli city of Petach Tikvah. The Hatzalah Judea and Samaria rescue group said the reported terrorist shooting took place near the Avi Nof farm just outside Ariel’s western industrial park, located close to the Palestinian village of Salfit. 'A report was received of a shooting incident near Ariel in the Ephraim Brigade [deployment area],' the Israel Defense Forces said. 'The civilian was moderately injured and is currently receiving medical treatment.' Israeli security forces launched a large-scale manhunt for the terrorist, who fled the scene of the attack, and set up roadblocks, the IDF stated. Palestinian terrorists targeted Jews in Judea and Samaria at least 6,343 times in 2024, including 179 incidents involving gunfire, according to figures made public by Hatzalah Judea and Samaria on Feb. 17. Twenty-seven Israelis were murdered in Judea and Samaria in 2024, and more than 300 others were wounded, the group said in its annual report.

Tsurkov, a Middle East researcher at Princeton University, was kidnapped in 2023 while traveling to Iraq on her Russian passport to conduct research for her doctoral dissertation. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Talks are reportedly underway regarding the release of Israeli-Russian researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov, but an Iraqi official admits that her exact location is uncertain, and she may have been transferred to Iran, according to Ynet. Tsurkov, a Middle East researcher at Princeton University, was kidnapped in 2023 while traveling to Iraq on her Russian passport to conduct research for her doctoral dissertation. She was taken in Baghdad by Kata'ib Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian Iraqi terrorist group. The official reported that Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani 'does not know where Tsurkov is being held,' adding, 'It’s a stroke of luck she’s still alive. Usually, captives don’t survive interrogations.' Two Trump administration officials, hostage envoy Adam Boehler and Rep. Mike Waltz, are negotiating for Tsurkov's release. Boehler told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya that the Trump administration is pressuring Iraq’s PM, who 'continues to claim he doesn’t know where Tsurkov is being held.' Emma Tsurkov, Elizabeth’s sister, shared in an interview with Ynet, 'I’ve spoken directly with Adam Boehler several times and met his team. The updates are encouraging. It’s amazing that in just a few weeks of determined effort, they’ve made more progress than in the last two years. I really hope this pressure from the Americans works soon so I can hug my sister again.' She added, 'They’re very careful not to give me false hope, but in all my conversations with Adam Boehler, he’s been incredibly kind and patient. I don’t know how he finds the strength to speak with hostage families with such empathy.' She also shared, 'He told me the same thing Steve Witkoff had said when I met him in Washington a week and a half ago — that they are working on this, that my sister is important to them, and that it’s unacceptable for a Princeton student to be held captive in a country allied with the U.S.' The post Iraqi official admits hostage Elizabeth Tsurkov may have been sent to Iran appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/iraqi-official-admits-hostage-elizabeth-tsurkov-may-have-been-sent-to-iran/	2025-03-12T13:50:49-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tsurkov.jpg

The report claims that Israel has deployed surveillance devices as small as a worm, hidden in bags placed in remote areas like cemeteries or populated locations. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF is reportedly using drones and small surveillance devices to gather data on hostages and potential future targets in Gaza, according to the Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat. The report claims that Israel has deployed surveillance devices as small as a worm, hidden in bags placed in remote areas like cemeteries or populated locations. The report also states that terrorists who discovered these devices quickly destroyed them. Gaza security forces are monitoring the devices to check if Israelis attempt to retrieve them. The data collected by the surveillance devices has helped Israel arrest Palestinian terrorists. Israel is gathering data to update its Gaza database and has deployed surveillance devices in central Khan Yunis, Deir al-Balah, the al-Nuseirat refugee camp, the al-Bureij refugee camp, the al-Zawaida refugee camp, and neighborhoods in Gaza City. Terrorist organizations are on high alert for an Israeli ground operation. They are also circulating reports that Israel has used suicide drones to target terrorist commanders. According to a Hamas-affiliated Telegram channel, Al-Hares (The Guardian), Israel has intensified its intelligence operations during Ramadan. 'Due to Israel’s intelligence efforts and information gathering, families of resistance fighters must proceed with extreme caution and be prepared for any emergency situation,' the channel stated. Hamas has warned its terrorists to avoid sharing information about other members of the organization and to refrain from posting about the group on social media. According to military sources, the Israel Defense Forces are ready to redeploy throughout the Gaza Strip if the Cabinet issues the order. Army Radio reported that the IDF is preparing to send an additional division back to the Gaza Strip, with the headquarters of the reservist 252nd Division being re-mobilized to Gaza City. This division had previously left the Netzarim Corridor, which separates northern Gaza from the rest of the Strip, in December. According to the report, IDF Southern Command has approved plans and battle procedures for a potential return to combat. All leave has been canceled for forces in the sector until further notice. The IDF also stated that civilian safety guidelines in the border areas remain unchanged, although the situation is being continuously reassessed.

By World Israel News U.S. President Donald Trump met with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin in the White House today. Before the meeting, Trump seemed to contradict earlier statements when saying, 'No one is expelling anyone from Gaza.' In early February, Trump revealed a plan to relocate civilians from Gaza to allow the U.S. to begin rebuilding the Gaza Strip. During a press conference at the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on February 4, Trump stated that the United States would 'take over' Gaza. Initially, Trump suggested that Palestinians could return to Gaza. However, he revised his position on February 10, telling Fox News host Bret Baier that under his plan, Palestinians who leave the Gaza Strip would not be allowed to return, as they would be provided with 'much better housing' elsewhere. Trump has also proposed relocating Gaza's current population to a single central location or several different sites. Reuters reported that Hamas welcomed the apparent reversal by Trump on the call for the displacement of Gazans, urging him not to align with the agenda of the 'extreme Zionist right.' Prime Minister Martin issued a statement calling for increased aid to Gaza. He also urged a ceasefire and the return of hostages. Relations between Israel and Ireland have been strained since October 7, with the Irish government taking a harsh stance against the Jewish state. Ireland supported South Africa's motion in the International Criminal Court accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. In December, Israel closed its embassy in Ireland, citing 'anti-Israel policies.' Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa’ar, commented on the embassy closing, saying, 'The actions and anti-Semitic rhetoric used by Ireland against Israel are rooted in the delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state, along with double standards. Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel.'

New DNA mapping reveals gene ‘on/off’ switches, paving way for di...	In addition to mapping the patterns, the researchers uncovered previously unknown imprinting effects, where genes are expressed differently depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or father. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli researchers mapping DNA methylation — a process where a small chemical tag is attached to a person’s DNA — said they have uncovered insights into how genes are turned on and off, potentially revolutionizing how genetic diseases are diagnosed and treated. DNA methylation is a process where a small chemical tag called a 'methyl group' attaches to a specific part of the DNA molecule. This modification influences whether a gene is active or silent, without changing the underlying genetic sequence. DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, affecting everything from cell development to disease prevention. Researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Hadassah Medical Center — led by PhD student Jonathan Rosenski — identified more than 34,000 genomic regions with distinct 'on/off' methylation patterns, many of which vary depending on the cell type. 'Our findings are a key step in understanding how DNA methylation regulates gene activity in different cell types,' said Hebrew University Prof. Tommy Kaplan, who guided Rosenski’s research. 'These findings open up new avenues for exploring diseases where gene regulation goes awry.' The study was recently published in the peer-reviewed Nature Genetics journal. In addition to mapping the patterns, the researchers uncovered previously unknown imprinting effects, where genes are expressed differently depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or father. 'The role of imprinting in regulating genes has long been a mystery, and our study provides new insights into how these inherited factors influence gene expression,' said Prof. Yuval Dor from the Faculty of Medicine at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Hadassah Medical Center, who also provided guidance. 'This discovery could help us understand rare genetic disorders that involve faulty imprinting processes.' The researchers employed a combination of cutting-edge technologies, including machine learning and whole-genome sequencing, to map DNA methylation patterns across a wide variety of cell types. This approach enabled them to analyze methylation at an unprecedented level of detail, providing a comprehensive map of gene regulation in the human genome. According to Kaplan, 'The integration of machine learning with genomic data allowed us to identify complex patterns that traditional methods couldn’t reveal. This technique was crucial for unlocking the full potential of our research.' One of the most important aspects of the study is how it links DNA methylation to both genetic variations and parental imprinting. 'Our research shows that genetic variations don’t just affect the gene itself, but also the methylation patterns around it, influencing whether the gene is turned on or off,' Dor explained. The findings have open up wide-ranging possibilities for understanding the molecular basis of genetic diseases and could lead to new diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies. One of the most immediate benefits could be the development of more accurate diagnostic tests for diseases that are influenced by methylation changes, such as cancer and genetic disorders. 'By identifying specific methylation patterns associated with diseases, we can create tests that detect these conditions earlier, improving the chances of successful treatment,' Kaplan said. In cancer, for example, abnormal DNA methylation patterns are often present before tumors are detectable by traditional methods, making early diagnosis possible. For rare genetic diseases like CHARGE syndrome, which is caused by faulty gene regulation, understanding methylation could lead to improved diagnostic techniques and more targeted treatments. 'This research provides us with new tools to better understand how genetic disorders like CHARGE syndrome develop and how they can be treated,' Dor remarked. The study also holds promise for developing treatments tailored to an individual’s specific genetic and epigenetic profile. 'Personalized medicine is the future, and this research is a critical step in that direction,' Kaplan explained. 'By analyzing a patient’s DNA methylation patterns, we can choose the most effective treatment for them, minimizing side effects and improving outcomes.' Furthermore, the study could have implications for aging and age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s. As people age, changes in DNA methylation patterns can lead to the activation or silencing of genes associated with those diseases. 'Understanding how methylation changes over time will be essential for developing strategies to slow down aging and prevent age-related conditions,' Dor added.

‘Over 2,000 attempted terror attacks in past year’	Unlike previous operations in Judea and Samaria, which typically involved withdrawals within days or weeks, 'Iron Wall' is characterized by a more prolonged presence. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS The Israel Defense Forces’ 'Operation Iron Wall,' an extensive and ongoing counterterrorism effort in Judea and Samaria launched on Jan. 21, is seeing the Israeli military take a new, decisive and sustained approach. 'Iron Wall,' which is particularly focused on the Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur al-Shams camps, has involved elite units, armored vehicles (tanks and Eitan armored personnel carriers) and a prolonged Israeli ground presence, reflecting a shift in Israel’s approach to counterterrorism in this sector. The failed mass bombing in Bat Yam and Holon on Feb. 20 is a vivid reminder of the ongoing lethal terror threat to Israeli cities emanating from Samaria in particular. On Monday, a terrorist hurled rocks at an Israeli vehicle traveling on a civilian road near Odala, south of Nablus, injuring an Israeli baby. The infant was treated by medical staff at the scene. On Tuesday, elite forces operating under Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) intelligence guidance eliminated multiple armed terrorists in Jenin and nearby Qabatiya, and arrested a senior terror suspect. The Israeli forces encountered several armed terrorists who had barricaded themselves inside a building in Jenin. After an exchange of fire, two of the terrorists were eliminated and another wounded, according to the IDF. The IDF further stated that security forces had identified and destroyed two vehicles in Jenin loaded with weapons and explosives intended for terrorist attacks. A military source highlighted the growing threat in Judea and Samaria, telling JNS that, 'In the past year alone, there have been over 2,000 attempted terrorist attacks. Some we managed to prevent, others we did not. We have seen attacks carried out, and we launched this operation because we continue to see the intent, motivation and capability to carry out terror attacks.' The source confirmed that 'a small number of tanks have been used in the operation,' noting that 'this is not something we have seen in this area for a long time.' The IDF is 'using all available tools to combat terror while minimizing harm to civilians,' the source added. Moreover, unlike previous operations in Judea and Samaria, which typically involved withdrawals within days or weeks, 'Iron Wall' is characterized by a more prolonged presence. 'The IDF has conducted operations in Judea and Samaria before, but this one is more extensive. It is an intensified presence within the terror strongholds,' the source explained. The primary focus remains in northern Samaria. 'Jenin is the central hotspot, followed by Tulkarem and Nur Shams,' the source said. 'We are also continuing counterterrorism activities across Judea and Samaria, including nightly arrests.' The source clarified that the terrorist threats are varied, involving both structured organizations and 'lone wolf' attackers. 'We are seeing both organized attacks influenced by Hamas and independent assailants. There is no single dominant faction.' The source also confirmed that there is a clear Iranian influence, both in terms of ideology and through weapons smuggled from Jordan and other external sources. The IDF announced on Saturday that security forces had located a vehicle containing three firearms and ammunition magazines in the village of Immatin, west of Nablus. The military revealed on March 6 that forces had discovered and destroyed an improvised bomb-making laboratory and a weapons cache in the Samaria region. Soldiers from the Shimshon Battalion, part of the Kfir Brigade, located and dismantled a lab for producing explosive devices and a storage facility containing approximately 100 pipe bombs, eight underground explosives and a system for activating explosive devices. Additionally, security forces located and destroyed 'another improvised drone production facility and several buildings used as terror infrastructure in Tulkarem.' One of the key challenges facing the IDF in this operation is the extensive use of civilian infrastructure by terrorist groups, the source said. 'We are seeing terrorists operating from within civilian-populated areas, including mosques, schools and even kindergartens. They plant roadside bombs under main roads and wait for our forces to pass before detonating them,' the source added. 'To neutralize these hidden explosives, we often have to dig up entire roads, which results in extensive damage. But this is necessary to prevent casualties among our soldiers,' the source explained. The source also stressed that the IDF is taking measures to repair infrastructure damage to the extent possible following counter-IED operations. Looking ahead, 'Iron Wall' signals a fundamental shift in Israel’s security approach in Judea and Samaria. The open-ended presence of IDF forces in terrorist strongholds, the increased use of armored units and the deployment of elite counterterrorism forces all point to an intensification in Israel’s efforts to dismantle terror networks.

By JNS The Israeli Attorney General’s Office filed an indictment Wednesday against journalist Saeed Hassanain, a former commentator for the Bnei Sakhnin soccer team, charging him with contacting a foreign agent and identifying with a terrorist organization. The charges stem from an interview Hassanain conducted with the Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV, during which he made statements against the Israel Defense Forces and the State of Israel. הזדהות עם ארגון טרור: כתב אישום הוגש נגד הכרוז של בני סכנין לכתבה - צילום: Little Savage pic.twitter.com/eI7Yf0hMtx &mdash; עכשיו 14 (@Now14Israel) March 12, 2025 According to the indictment, during the interview Hassanain referred to the Israel Defense Forces as an 'occupying army' and labeled Israel as 'the enemy.' He also condemned those who serve in the Israeli military, calling them 'weaklings who join the ranks of the army and serve the enemy army.' In addition to these allegations, Hassanain is accused of destroying evidence by breaking the phone he used to contact Al-Aqsa TV officials. The Israel Police’s Northern District led the investigation, with officers from the Galilee Region Crime Fighting Unit handling the case. The police statement emphasized that Hassanain’s actions constituted 'praise, sympathy and identification with a terrorist organization,' as well as unlawful contact with a foreign agent. Northern District Commander Chief Meir Eliyahu reaffirmed law enforcement’s commitment to combating incitement and threats to national security. 'The Israel Police is acting with determination and with a variety of tools at its disposal to prevent any action that endangers the security of the state and its residents. We will not tolerate any type of incitement or support for terrorist organizations. Anyone involved in such offenses will face consequences in accordance with the law,' said Eliyahu. Hassanain, a resident of Shefa-Amr, was arrested two weeks ago. His legal representatives have not yet issued a public response to the charges.

Palestinian man breaks into major IDF base and injures soldier du...	Jenin man arrested after stealing car near Tel Aviv, ramming through gate at Israeli army base, and injuring IDF soldier. By World Israel News Staff A serious security breach occurred on Tuesday morning at the Tzrifin military base near Tel Aviv, one of the IDF's largest installations, leaving an Israeli soldier injured. During the incident, a Palestinian Authority resident who had infiltrated into Israel from Jenin stole a vehicle in the Tel Aviv area, drove down Highway 44, towards the Tzrifin base. The suspect rammed through a checkpoint at the base, and injured a soldier before being apprehended in Ramla following a police chase. After breaching the base's outer perimeter, the suspect moved through the compound for several minutes before fleeing the area. After escaping the base, the suspect was located and apprehended by police officers in the nearby town of Ramle. An IDF spokesperson said Tuesday that there are no indications the incident had a terrorist motive. According to the IDF, one soldier 'was injured by a vehicle at the checkpoint at the Tzrifin base gate.' Army investigators have launched a probe into the matter. The injured soldier, a man in his 20s, was transported to a nearby hospital for treatment. His condition was not immediately disclosed, but his family has been notified. This incident comes less than a month after a similar event on February 17, when a Palestinian Arab car thief who infiltrated into Israel from the Judea and Samaria region attempted to steal a vehicle from a parking lot at the Tzrifin base. During the February 17th incident, the suspect tried to seize a police officer's gun before fleeing, but was captured after a foot chase by Central District officers. The IDF continues to investigate how the suspect managed to breach security protocols and is reviewing procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Hamas sends 4-year-old boy to IDF base for terrorist activity	Cynical use of children' - Young boy sent by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip towards an IDF position in an apparent test of soldiers' readiness. By World Israel News Staff On Tuesday, IDF soldiers stationed in the Gaza Strip encountered a four-year-old Gazan child acting on orders of Hamas terrorists, an IDF spokesperson said Wednesday. The incident occurred at an Israeli army position in a Gaza security zone Tuesday night, when a young boy was spotted approaching a group of IDF soldiers. The soldiers asked the boy why he had walked towards their position, to which he responded that he had been sent there by Hamas terrorists. 'Yesterday, IDF soldiers identified a 4-year-old child moving towards a post in the security zone,' the army said. 'The boy was returned to Gaza by IDF forces and in coordination with international organizations. In a conversation with the soldiers, the child said that he was sent to the post by the Hamas terrorist organization.' The Israeli Defense Ministry's Coordinator for Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) oversaw the child's return to the interior of the Gaza Strip. The IDF condemned Hamas for its cynical 'exploitation' of Gaza civilians. 'Hamas does not hesitate to use any means to cynically use and exploit civilians and children to advance its terrorism.' 'This is a severe violation of all moral and international norms, and the international community must wake up and act decisively against the use of children as tools of warfare.' Hamas has been observed in the past using children in various support roles for terrorist activities, including service as couriers to transport bombs, espionage activity, and to test IDF responses at border crossings and other positions.

Hezbollah terrorist who plotted NY attack to be deported from US	Lebanese national Basel Bassel Ebbadi had tried to sneak into the country and admitted wanting to kill people in New York with a bomb. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A year to the month he was captured trying to sneak into the United States, an admitted Hezbollah terrorist is set to be deported, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) told The New York Post Monday. Lebanese national Basel Bassel Ebbadi, 22, was caught by border agents in El Paso, Texas on March 9, 2024. He had no identification, and when he was asked while undergoing routine medical screening what he was doing in the U.S, he said he wanted to get to New York where he was 'going to try to make a bomb,' according to official documents examined by the paper. He also said that he had 'trained for jihad' for seven years, and then did a four-year stint as an armed guard protecting Hezbollah assets in his home country. This would mean that he began his terrorist training as a young child. Ebbadi later claimed instead that he was seeking asylum because he 'didn’t want to kill people,' but was arrested and sent to an ICE facility. Fox News reported Tuesday that he had been put in isolation there after making 'terroristic threats to personnel.' Although he was sent to ICE with an 'order of expedited removal' and was a confessed member of a group designated by the U.S. and many other countries as a terrorist organization, he was soon brought to court and convicted on the single charge of illegal entry. He served his five-month sentence in federal prison and then spent the next three and a half months in ICE custody before an immigration judge reinstated the deportation order in mid-January. It has taken a further two months for all administrative matters to be settled and ICE expects that Ebbadi will be leaving the U.S. permanently in the very near future. President Donald Trump came into office pledging to shut down the huge flow of unlawful migrants into the U.S, whose numbers reached the low millions under the previous, Biden administration. Most of them came in through the country’s southern border, as did Ebbadi, and security there has been tightened considerably since Trump’s January inauguration. Qatari-owned news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported Sunday that the administration has also begun retroactively cancelling the visas of people who could fall under an executive order Trump signed in January that goes beyond the travel ban he had declared on seven Muslim-majority countries during his first term. The order, called 'Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and other National Security and Public Safety Threats,' denies applicants visas or entry to the U.S. if they 'bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.' Trump had promised during his campaign to forbid entry to those coming from Gaza, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and 'anywhere else that threatens our security.'

Tucker Carlson under fire for interview with Hamas patron	Tucker Carlson sold his soul to the Muslim Brotherhood' - Evangelical leader rips right-wing podcaster and former Fox News host, accusing him of platforming antisemites and promoting conspiracy theories. By World Israel News Staff Right-wing podcaster and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson drew criticism this week, days after he published an interview with a patron of the Hamas terror organization who used the interview to warn against strikes on Iran's nuclear program. Last Friday, Carlson, 55, released an interview with Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Serving as the oil-rich Gulf state's top diplomat for the past decade, Al Thani has overseen the continuation and strengthening of Doha's ties with Iran, and prior to October 7th, 2023, the deepening of Qatari support for the Hamas terror organization in Gaza. Al Thani decried Israel's reported plans to possibly carry out airstrikes against Iran's nuclear facilities later this year, warning that any such attack would leave the Gulf states without water and with 'no life.' In his X/Twitter post of the interview, Carlson appeared to endorse Al Thani's stance on a strike on Iran's nuclear program, writing 'There’s enormous pressure on the United States to participate in a brand new war against Iran. The government of Qatar thinks that’s unwise, so of course they’re being slandered relentlessly in American media.' Al Thani also used the interview to lambast Israel's opposition to Palestinian statehood, and a justified Palestinian terrorism against Israel while comparing the presence of Jews in Judea and Samaria to terror attacks. 'The situation is going backward,' said Al Thani. 'More settlements, more violence, more&#8230;policies which are destructive for the Palestinians, unfortunately.' 'We are expecting from the Palestinians just to obey, to be quiet, and for nothing to be instigated.' 'This is normal, you know, when you have a situation lasting that long, to have this kind of turbulence all the time, and I'm not talking about the 7th of October, I'm talking about the entire period.' On Tuesday, conservative activist and Evangelical leader Laurie Cardoza-Moore blasted Carlson over the interview, accusing him of 'pro-Iranian advocacy.' 'Since leaving Fox News, Carlson has increasingly platformed anti-Semites and conspiracy theorists, giving them unchallenged airtime to spread hate,' Cardoza-Moore’s group, Proclaiming Justice to the Nations, said in a statement, suggesting Carlson 'was purchased by Qatari oil money.' 'Did Tucker just take off his mask for Purim,' Cardoza-Moore asked rhetorically. 'Was this all a dance for his new puppet masters in Doha? Is Tucker the Emir’s new court jester?' 'Has Tucker Carlson sold his soul to the Muslim Brotherhood? He appears to have fully cozied up to Qatar - one of world’s biggest sponsors of Islamist terrorism, while in the same week, beginning to advocate in support of letting Iran go nuclear. Qatar and Iran have bankrolled organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah for decades.' 'For decades Qatar has been the biggest donor to American universities and K-12 education in our country - pushing anti-American and anti-Semitic content to our children.' 'This is not just about Israel and Jews – it’s about the future of our own beloved Republic. We the people demand that Tucker Carlson stop bearing false witness and unveil his true allegiances. The Lord knows that putting Iran and Qatar First means putting America Last.'

Poll: Overwhelming majority of voters say Dems are out of touch a...	While the Democratic Party has long sought to brand itself as the working-class party, for example, less than 40 percent of those polled think the party truly values work. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Nearly 70 percent of voters in battleground districts see congressional Democrats as out of touch, prioritizing political correctness over real issues, according to a poll released Tuesday. Only 39 percent of voters believe Democrats have the right priorities, while 69 percent say Democrats are 'too focused on being politically correct,' a poll by the Democratic group Navigator Research found. The survey, conducted in 62 swing districts, also showed that more than half of voters think the Democratic Party is 'elitist' and does not share their values. The findings come as Democrats still struggle to regain their footing nearly two months into President Donald Trump's second term. House Democrats are set to hear from one of the poll's researchers at a Wednesday conference as they work to rebuild the party's image ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, Politico reported. 'The Democratic brand is still not where it needs to be in terms of core trust and understanding people’s challenges,' said Molly Murphy, a Democratic strategist who worked on the Tuesday poll, adding that 'criticism of Trump doesn't translate into trust in Democrats.' While the Democratic Party has long sought to brand itself as the working-class party, for example, less than 40 percent of those polled think the party truly values work, with 56 percent saying Democrats are not looking out for working people. Murphy acknowledged the disconnect, saying, 'How can you care about working people if you don't care about work? It's going to be really hard in the midterms if voters don't think we care about work.' Democrats also trail Republicans on the economy, 41 percent to 46 percent, according to the poll. Only 27 percent of independents, meanwhile, think Democrats prioritize people like them, while 55 percent say the party is more focused on others.

Former Oct. 7 hostage reveals savage ‘birthday gift’ Hamas gave t...	To maintain his sanity, Wenkert spoke aloud to himself for two hours each day. When his birthday came, his 'present' was being brutally beaten with an iron rod. By Jewish Breaking News Omer Wenkert has broken his silence over the abuse and torture he experienced during his 505 days in Hamas captivity. When Hamas started infiltrating southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Wenkert sought safety in a shelter which was soon discovered. 'I heard ‘Allahu Akbar,’ the pin of a grenade being pulled, and then—boom. Three grenades exploded inside the shelter,' Wenkert recalled to Channel 12 News. In the chaos that followed, Wenkert witnessed people burned alive and made the desperate decision to shield himself with dead bodies. A young woman, whose name he doesn’t know, saved his life by grabbing a grenade and throwing it back outside. Eventually, Wenkert decided, 'My parents don’t deserve to receive my burnt body. I refuse to die like this.' When he emerged from the shelter, a group of terrorists were waiting. 'We’re not shooting. Come here,' one terrorist told him. Wenkert was bound and loaded onto a pickup truck. Upon entering Gaza, a mob beat him brutally. Conscious of his situation, he made sure to look at cameras, hoping evidence of his survival would reach the outside world. Almost immediately, Wenkert was taken underground into the vast labyrinth of Hamas tunnels under Gaza. Initially held with Thai hostages and fellow Israeli Liam Or, their daily rations consisted of three dates in the morning, half a pita at night, and half a liter of water shared between two people. To maintain his sanity, Wenkert spoke aloud to himself for two hours each day. When his birthday came, his 'present' was being brutally beaten with an iron rod. 'I saw the dates — I was beaten that day. That was my birthday gift. That was the day I took a rod to the head. The door burst open, and the terrorist woke me with absolute frenzy and insane aggression. He humiliated me, beat me, came at me with an iron rod,' he recalled. Again, I had made up my mind that I wouldn’t show weakness in front of them. So even as he did it, I looked him in the eyes.' After Or’s release in November 2023, Wenkert’s situation worsened. He was moved to a one-meter-by-one-meter room. For 245 days, he endured solitary confinement, completely cut off from the outside world. 'I thought they were burying me alive,' he recollected. His isolation finally ended when hostages Tal Shoham, Evyatar David, and Guy Gilboa-Dalal were thrown into the 23-year-old’s cell. Starved for human connection, Wenkert’s first words to them were, 'I need a hug. I need human contact.' The four of them formed an unbreakable bond, carefully rationing their meager food for survival. At some point, Hamas terrorists came to booby-trap their room, warning, 'If the IDF comes to rescue you, we will all die together.' When Wenkert learned he would be released while David and Gilboa-Dalal would remain captive, he was devastated. As he was being released during a propaganda handover ceremony last month, Wenkert caught a glimpse of them smiling faintly and waving goodbye from inside a Hamas van. 'That small smile was everything,' he said. Since returning home, Wenkert has been consumed with thoughts of those still in captivity. 'I can’t stop thinking about them. I know what they’re going through; it’s unbearable. I don’t think ‘brothers’ is a word that suffices to describe our relationship. I have a need for them right now.' 'I told them, I won’t rest for a moment until you return.'

Dream costumes: Israeli innovators bring joy to children with dis...	The designs do not merely accommodate their mobility aids but transform them into integral and impressive parts of the costumes. By Pesach Benson, TPS The children’s costumes required months of brainstorming and development by Israeli tech students and workers. But their work culminated in an emotional high point on Monday as 30 children with disabilities celebrated Purim with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in costumes that incorporated their wheelchairs and walkers. For one boy who wanted to dress up as a soldier, his wheelchair became a tank. A girl with cerebral palsy had her wheelchair integrated into her Chocolate Queen costume. A walker became part of a rocket ship for an astronaut, while another boy’s wheelchair became part of his Lightning McQueen costume. 'This project is truly inspiring,' Herzog said. 'It showcases the power of creativity and innovation in making the world more inclusive. I hope to see many more initiatives like this, where academia, community, and values come together for real social impact.' The 'Dream Costumes' project, now in its tenth year, brings together students from the Holon Institute of Technology (HIT), employees of WIX, and the children of Beit Issie Shaprio, a non-profit organization that provides education, therapy and advocacy for children with disabilities. The designs do not merely accommodate their mobility aids but transform them into integral and impressive parts of the costumes. First Lady Michal Herzog greeted the children and the volunteers who worked on the costumes. 'The Holon Institute of Technology has made social responsibility a core part of its identity. This project is a beautiful example of how education can extend beyond the classroom to change lives in a meaningful way,' the First Lady said. Among the children was 10-year-old Itamar, who has cerebral palsy and mild-to-moderate intellectual disabilities. His dream was to dress as an IDF jeep, a tribute to his father, a security officer, and his brothers, who are serving in the military. 'It connects me to my family,' he said, smiling as he admired his costume. His wheelchair had been transformed into a fully designed military jeep, complete with an Israeli flag waving proudly from the back. Said HIT President Professor Eduard Yakubov, 'When design students create a costume for a child with a disability, they are not just designing an outfit – they are shaping an experience, a sense of value, and belonging. It’s an opportunity for them to realize that their design can change lives. For us, this is a true mission. It may be a costume for just one day – but its memory will stay with these children for a lifetime.' Purim celebrates the Jewish people’s survival from a plot to exterminate them in ancient Persia, as described in the Book of Esther. The holiday, which begins on Thursday night at sundown, is celebrated with feasting, costumes, and gifts of food and charity.

Iran’s president to Trump: I will not negotiate, ‘do whatever the...	In an interview with Fox Business, Trump said last week, 'There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal' to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. By Reuters and The Algemeiner President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would not negotiate with the US while being threatened, telling President Donald Trump to 'do whatever the hell you want,' Iranian state media reported on Tuesday. 'It is unacceptable for us that they [the US] give orders and make threats. I won’t even negotiate with you. Do whatever the hell you want,' state media quoted Pezeshkian as saying. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that Tehran would not be bullied into negotiations, a day after Trump said he had sent a letter urging Iran to engage in talks on a new nuclear deal. While expressing openness to a deal with Tehran, Trump has reinstated the 'maximum pressure' campaign he applied in his first term as president to isolate Iran from the global economy and drive its oil exports down towards zero. In an interview with Fox Business, Trump said last week, 'There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal' to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran has long denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. However, it is 'dramatically' accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60 percent purity, close to the roughly 90 percent weapons-grade level, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, has warned. Iran has accelerated its nuclear work since 2019, a year after then-President Trump ditched Tehran’s 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy.

Majority of Israeli Jews say Judea and Samaria towns contribute t...	While in October only a third of Israeli Jews said they agreed with this course of action, the figure has since risen to 47%. By Akiva Van Konigsveld, JNS Fifty-eight percent of Israeli Jews believe that Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria contribute to the security of the entire country, according to a poll published by the Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) on Tuesday. Asked whether they concurred with the statement that 'Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria create deterrence and contribute to the security of all citizens of Israel,' 46% responded that they 'very much agree,' while 12% said they 'somewhat' concur. In the past six months, there has been an increase in the percentage of Jews who believe that Israel 'should strengthen its control over the Palestinians, expand settlements, consider dissolving the Palestinian Authority and perhaps annexing Judea and Samaria,' according to the survey. While in October only a third of Israeli Jews said they agreed with this course of action, the figure has since risen to 47%. At the same time, there was a decline in Jews who believe Israel should strive for a peace agreement with 'moderate Palestinians' and allow the establishment of a 'peaceful' Palestinian state alongside the Jewish one. While in October a fifth of Israeli Jews backed a Palestinian state, this share has plummeted to 11%, according to the latest JPPI poll. The survey suggests that 85% of the Jewish public in Israel thinks that 'there is no chance of a peace agreement with the Palestinians in the foreseeable future,' including 70% that said they strongly believe this. 'The survey results show that a large majority of Israelis believe that a solution to the ‘Palestinian issue’ and Israel’s control over Judea and Samaria is unlikely in the foreseeable future,' said JPPI director-general Shuki Friedman. This represents 'an opportunity for Israeli society to move past this dispute and address pressing internal issues,' he added.

Moroccan court jails Islamist for praising attack in Israel	A Moroccan Islamist was sentenced to two years in prison for incitement after he repeatedly praised a Moroccan terrorist who stabbed Israelis in Tel Aviv earlier this year. By World Israel News Staff A Moroccan court has sentenced a local Islamist to two years in prison, after he was convicted of repeatedly publicly praising a Moroccan terrorist who committed a stabbing attack against Israelis in Tel Aviv, the suspect's lawyer said. On Monday, attorney Mohamed Serroukh announced that his client, Redouane El Kastit, was convicted by a Tangier court of incitement to hatred, discrimination, and insulting a public body, in connection with 15 posts to his Facebook account in which he lauded Abdelaziz Kaddi for his January 21st attack in Tel Aviv's Nahalat Binyamin Street. Kaddi, a 29-year-old Moroccan national who held an American green card, entered Israel with a tourist visa on January 18th and carried out a stabbing attack in Tel Aviv, wounding four people. During the attack, Kaddi was shot and killed by a legally-armed female civilian. In the days following Kaddi's attack, El Kastit posted at least 15 social media comments praising Kaddi for his actions. Among other things, El Kastit lauded Kaddi's attack as the beginning of a 'blessed racist campaign.' In addition, prosecutors claimed El Kastit publicized photographs of Kaddi, and noted the fact that he was Moroccan, expressing pride in the fact that a fellow countryman had carried out the attack on Israelis. Police took El Kastit into custody on February 5th. El Kastit denied publishing the posts, Serroukh said, adding that he is planning to appeal the sentence, which he claimed was disproportionate, calling it a 'harsh ruling.' 'The court considered this an endorsement of a terrorist act,' Serroukh added. Morocco is one of the few Arab states with full diplomatic relations, having signed on to the Abraham Accords in 2020, in exchange for U.S. support for Rabat's claims over the disputed Western Sahara.

US resumes military aid and intelligence sharing as Ukraine indic...	The administration’s decision marked a sharp shift from only a week ago, when it imposed the measures to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to enter talks to end the war with invading Russian forces. By Matthew Lee, Associated Press The Trump administration lifted its suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine, and Kyiv signaled that it was open to a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia, pending Moscow’s agreement, American and Ukrainian officials said Tuesday following talks in Saudi Arabia. The administration’s decision marked a sharp shift from only a week ago, when it imposed the measures to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to enter talks to end the war with invading Russian forces. The suspension of U.S. assistance came days after Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump argued about the war in a tense White House meeting. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led the U.S. delegation to the talks in Jeddah, said Washington would present the ceasefire offer to the Kremlin, which has thus far opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict without accepting any concessions. 'We’re going to tell them this is what’s on the table. Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking. And now it’ll be up to them to say yes or no,' Rubio told reporters after the meeting.

Netanyahu sues Ya’alon over the accusation that he received funds...	Netanyahu: 'Let me be clear: I received nothing from Qatar, but I will be receiving something from Bogie (Ya'alon) and this is just the beginning.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he is suing former Minister Moshe Ya'alon over accusations that the premier accepted money from Qatar. In a video, Netanyahu stated, 'I will not be deterred from making the right decisions for our nation's security—not by fake campaigns or fabricated scandals dominating the news.' He added, 'The public is uninterested because they know it’s all false, and the number of cases filed is much lower than the number being opened.' He continued, 'I’ve decided to stop staying silent. Today, I am suing 'Bogie' Ya'alon for the vile lie he spread, claiming I received money from Qatar. Let me be clear: I received nothing from Qatar, but I will be receiving something from Bogie, and this is just the beginning.' 'Nothing will stop me, not even this campaign of extortion and threats against me and my family,' he concluded. Netanyahu was responding to a Kan radio interview in which the former defense minister claimed that 'unverified intelligence details' from Emirati intelligence files suggest that the Prime Minister received $15 million in 2012 and $50 million from Qatar in 2018. Responding to Netanyahu's announcement of the lawsuit, Ya'alon said that the Prime Minister 'is feeling the pressure' from the investigation into alleged ties between Qatar and members of his office. 'The attempt to dismiss the head of Shin Bet and the attorney general is a result of this pressure,' he added and alleged that Netanyahu is trying to hold onto power rather than resolving the conflict in Gaza. Ya'alon said, 'I hear that Hamas’s financier intends to sue me.' 'Someone is feeling the pressure of the Shin Bet investigation, which has been placed under a gag order,' he added. 'The messianic, evasive, and corrupt government must be replaced as soon as possible to save the country,' Ya’alon concluded.

Former hostage from Nova music festival massacre invites Trump to...	The event on June 26 will also feature activities such as therapeutic workshops and spaces for dealing with trauma. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The second annual memorial concert honoring the victims killed at the Nova music festival in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, will take place in June, and US President Donald Trump has been invited to attend. The Tribe of Nova community announced on Tuesday details about the 'Nova Healing Concert' scheduled for June 26 at Tel Aviv’s Yarkon Park. Former hostage Mia Schem, who was abducted by Hamas terrorists at the site of the music festival, addressed the media in Israel on Tuesday to talk about the upcoming concert while also sharing a message with Trump. 'Thank you, President Trump, for everything you’re doing to release the hostages,' she said. 'I invite you to dance with us in Yarkon Park and celebrate the moment when everyone finally returns home.' 'My vision, and that of everyone’s, is that this year should be different,' Schem added. 'A year when we won’t have to shout but embrace. Let’s dance not just for them but with them. This is the strength of our community – it heals, it strengthens, it is our home.' The setlist for the concert includes Benaia Barabi, Berry Sakharof, Mosh Ben-Ari, Sasi and Rita. The event on June 26 will also feature activities such as therapeutic workshops and spaces for dealing with trauma. Tickets are open and available to the general public, and admission is free for survivors of the Oct. 7 massacre and members of the bereaved families. All profits from ticket sales and event sponsorships will be used by the Nova Tribe Community Association to support the physical and mental healing of Oct. 7 survivors and members of their families, as well as commemoration for those murdered during the Hamas terrorist attack. Last year’s memorial concert was attended by tens of thousands of young people, according to Ynet. Hamas-led terrorists from the Gaza Strip who infiltrated the music festival in Re’im during the early morning of Oct. 7, 2023, killed 370 people and abducted 44 hostages. Overall, the terrorists killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 captives during their rampage across southern Israel.

NY congressman Torres asks ‘where are the protests against Syria?...	No Jews, No News,' Torres quipped. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News New York Congressman Ritchie Torres criticized anti-Israel protesters for continuing to focus on Gaza while ignoring the massacre of Alawite minorities by the Syrian government. 'The new regime in Syria is massacring the Alawite minority population, leaving a death toll of more than 1,000. These mass atrocities have been met with deafening silence from all the anti-Israel agitators who spent the last year and a half engaged in human rights theater,' Torres wrote on X. 'No Jews, no news,' he added. The Syrian government announced it would open an investigation into the killings of Alawites. The Alawites appealed to Israel to intervene militarily against the new government. Leaders of the Alawite community, which had strongly backed President Bashar Assad, penned a letter to Israeli leaders, calling for the IDF to intervene in Syria on their behalf against the new regime. Alawite leaders sent letters to Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and to Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, requesting that Israel take military action to protect the Alawite community. 'Save us from the brutal regime, we will receive you with songs and flowers,' the letter reads in part, while urging the Israeli media to 'shed light on the massacres' in Latakia. In the letter, the Alawite leaders lamented that after 'the fall of the Assad regime and the assumption of power in Syria by an extremist Islamic group,' their community has been targeted by the new regime with acts of 'killing, kidnapping, displacement, and intimidation as a method of ruling and domination.' The letter’s signatories requested that the Israeli military 'move its planes and forces to protect us,' that the Israeli navy be deployed off Syria’s Mediterranean coast, and that Israel’s government 'raise the issue of crimes against the Alawites at the international level.' 'We say to the Jewish state, we extend our hands to you and will be your best and most loyal friends, so that you can rid us of this extremist Islamic rule that will serve as a place for training and preparing groups from which they will launch their fight against you.'

Dems offer lame excuses for why they refused to applaud anything ...	Anything he does, even if he cured cancer or ended war forever, will be something they’re against, no matter what it is. By Robert Spencer, Frontpage Magazine With the establishment media serving as their propaganda arm for decades, the Democrats aren’t used to be challenged, and it showed when 'Jesse Watters Primetime' producer Johnny Belisario went up to Capitol Hill to ask a few of our self-anointed moral superiors why they sat on their hands and scowled not only when President Trump, during his speech to a joint session of Congress, was speaking about policy measures they opposed, but even when he introduced a survivor of brain cancer and the mother of a murder victim. You’ll be shocked! — shocked! — to learn that none of those who were asked gave a straight answer, or dared to enunciate the truth that everyone knows but no one on the Democrat side of the aisle wants to state: the Democrat Party doesn’t stand for anything anymore except that it is opposed to Donald Trump. Anything he does, even if he cured cancer or ended war forever, will be something they’re against, no matter what it is. And so Belisario approached Sen. Cory Booker (D-Spartacus) and pointed out mildly that 'you didn’t stand up for anything.' Booker offered this explanation: 'The president got before the American people and didn’t talk about how he could drive down grocery prices.' Considering who was responsible for driving grocery prices up in the first place (hint: his name rhymes with Mold Schmoe Hidin’), harping on inflation is not the banger of a response that Booker and other Democrats evidently think it is. Nor does it explain why Booker sat on his hands and scowled when Trump was talking about a courageous young teen who beat cancer. Belisario moved on to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Cherokee Nation) who pointed out that she wasn’t mindlessly opposed to everything Trump said or did. 'I did clap,' she insisted, 'when he said that the United States has supported Ukraine.' Fox News, however, adds that Belisario went on to ask Pocahontas why she didn’t applaud when Trump introduced the mother of Laken Riley, a nursing student who was murdered by an illegal migrant while out for a jog at the University of Georgia. Predictably, 'when pressed on why she did not clap for Riley’s mother, she declined to respond.' It’s easy to understand why she didn’t. Warren was a fervent supporter of Old Joe Biden’s open-border policies, which the murderer of Laken Riley, José Antonio Ibarra, took advantage of when he entered the country in Sept. 2022. To applaud the grieving mother of someone who was killed because of policies she supported was too much for Warren, as it would have given her next electoral opponent ready footage to use in campaign ads skewering her for hypocrisy. And getting re-elected is what it’s all about, right? Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Get Trump) dismissed the idea that there was anything in Trump’s speech worth applauding, sniffing: 'There was nothing the president had to say that was either factual or truthful.' Schiff’s statement, of course, was neither factual nor truthful. There was certainly no lie in Trump’s applauding of the young cancer survivor, or in his words against revenge porn, or in numerous other aspects of his speech, and Schiff was about as credible here as he was when he claimed to have proof of Trump’s collusion with Russia. Nevertheless, when Belisario asked him about 'a CBS News survey found that 76% of viewers, who were primarily Republican, approved of Trump’s speech, citing his focus on reducing government waste, imposing tariffs, and securing the border,' Schiff remained steadfastly dismissive, saying: 'I don’t know what speech they were watching…it really wasn’t worth watching.' Belisario also caught up with Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Mogadishu), who responded: 'You need to get away from me.' Hey, that’s great advice for everyone. The usual sane Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman (D-Kind of R) was the only one to admit that the Democrats’ tantrum during the speech was not the best look for a party from which Americans are turning away in droves as they realize the full extent of how it has betrayed their interests. 'I don’t think that was the best look for our party last night,' Fetterman said, and that was a polite way of putting it. The Democrats persist in thinking that hatred of Trump can substitute for a coherent policy that is clearly in the interests of Americans. As long as they persist in this, they’re going to drive their party right over a cliff.

Syrian Druze deny agreeing to deal with new Islamist government	Flyers circulating in Sweida called the Druze who met with Sharaa 'vile dwarves' and 'pale, statusless people.' By Baruch Yedid, TPS A close associate of a key Syrian Druze leader denied reports the community reached an agreement to integrate itself into Syria’s transitional government in a conversation with The Press Service of Israel. 'The media reports about an agreement between the Druze and the Syrian regime are not true and we deny them outright,' said a figure close to Sheikh Hikmat al-Jari, the spiritual leader of Syria’s community of 700,000-800,000. 'We have a series of conditions before the sheikh agrees to what has been reported in the various channels and he is the only one authorized to make decisions on behalf of the Druze in Sweida,' he told TPS-IL. 'For now,' al-Jari’s associate told TPS-IL, 'His honor has not ordered the weapons to be handed over and his current position is that the weapons will not be handed over until a permanent government is established that is not a transitional government, after all the factions hand over their weapons and only when there is a state of security in Syria, which the current situation is far from being…' He added, 'The opposite is true. We only recently established a military council to protect the Druze in the province in order to stand up to the forces and the regime, whose relations with it are currently unclear.' According to al-Jari’s associate, 'We do not know how the agreement between the Syrian Democratic Forces and the government will affect those who signed it, but we, for now, are not going in that direction…' He said that some Druze who did meet with President Ahmed al-Sharaa 'were extremely low-ranking people who do not reflect the position in Sweida.' The 138,000 residents of Sweida, located near the borders of Israel and Jordan, are predominantly Druze. Flyers circulating in Sweida called the Druze who met with Sharaa 'vile dwarves' and 'pale, statusless people.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the demilitarization of southern Syria and protection for its Druze community on Feb. 23. An estimated 700,000-800,000 Druze live in Syria, mostly in southwestern areas near Israel and Jordan. They make up around four percent of the Syrian population. Analysts and Israeli Druze recently told TPS-IL that Netanyahu’s remarks were a major shift in Israeli policy. Israel is preparing to allow Syrian Druze to work in the Golan Heights. Israel sent forces into the 235 sq km buffer zone to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border when the regime of Bashar Assad collapsed in December. Israel also launched waves of airstrikes on Syrian army assets and Iranian stockpiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of radical Islamists. Israel considers the 1974 ceasefire agreement with Syria void until order is restored in Syria. Defense Minister Israel Katz said troops will remain in the buffer zone indefinitely.

IDF attacks on three fronts, eliminating dozens of threats	Israeli security forces killed three terrorists and arrested 10 others, including a senior operative, during counterterrorism raids in the Qabatiya and Jenin areas of northern Samaria. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS The Israel Defense Forces confirmed to JNS on Tuesday morning that a Lebanese individual wounded by Israeli forces after approaching the border on Monday had been evacuated to a hospital in Israel. On Monday evening, the Lebanese Armed Forces tweeted that a Lebanese soldier in civilian clothing had been shot in Southern Lebanon and evacuated to a hospital across the border. 'After contact was lost with one of the army soldiers, and as a result of follow-up and verification, it became clear that elements of the hostile Israeli forces had shot him while he was in civilian clothes in the outskirts of the town of Kfar Shuba on the southern border, which resulted in his injury, and then he was transferred into the Palestinian territories,' the LAF tweeted in Arabic. The Israeli military did not confirm that the individual was a member of the LAF, or where it occurred, saying only that Israeli forces had acted according to 'standard operating procedures.' The situation in Southern Lebanon remains volatile following the end of the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire on Feb. 18. The truce, which went into effect on Nov. 27, 2024, ended more than a year of war, after Hezbollah began launching attacks on Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, day after Hamas’s invasion of southern Israel. The IDF confirmed last month that its forces would remain in five outposts in Southern Lebanon beyond the ceasefire deadline. The decision was made in conjunction with the U.S. administration. Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem declared on Sunday that the Iranian proxy will not tolerate any Israeli military presence in Southern Lebanon. 'I say to the Israelis—if you stay in these positions, how long do you think it will last? The resistance [Hezbollah] will not allow you to remain there,' he said. 'If the occupation persists, the army, the people and the resistance will confront it. We have no ties to any agreement between the U.S. and Israel.' On Saturday, the Israeli Air Force attacked a Hezbollah operative who according to the IDF was engaged in terrorist activities in Southern Lebanon. The day before, the IAF carried out intelligence-based strikes on Hezbollah terror assets in Southern Lebanon. The targets included rocket launchers and weapons storage facilities that 'posed a threat to the State of Israel and constituted a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,' the IDF said. The military 'will prevent any attempt by Hezbollah to reestablish and rebuild itself,' the statement added. Three terrorists killed, senior operative captured in Samaria raids Israeli security forces killed three terrorists and arrested 10 others, including a senior operative, during counterterrorism raids in the Qabatiya and Jenin areas of northern Samaria, the Israel Defense Forces, Israel Police and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) announced on Tuesday. During the operation, the Israel Police’s elite Yamam unit engaged armed terrorists who had barricaded themselves in a building in Jenin. Two terrorists were killed in the exchange, and another was wounded. Additionally, IDF troops eliminated a terrorist who had opened fire on them. Among the 10 terrorists arrested was Liwaa Jaaz, a senior operative in the Jenin-based terror network. Israeli security forces also located and destroyed two vehicles loaded with weapons intended for use in attacks. No Israeli forces were injured in the operation. Israeli Air Force targets terrorists near central Gaza’s Netzarim Corridor The Israeli Air Force on Tuesday afternoon struck terrorists engaged in 'suspicious activity' in the area of Gaza’s Netzarim Corridor, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The suspects posed a threat to Israeli forces, the military said. According to Palestinian media reports, five Gazans were killed in the strike. The IDF withdrew from the Netzarim Corridor, which divides north and south Gaza, in January under the faltering ceasefire deal with Hamas. Israel’s Ynet news website reported that the Gaza strike came at the same time as a drone strike on a senior Hezbollah terrorist in Lebanon. On Monday, Israeli forces neutralized two terrorist squads seeking to ambush soldiers in the northern and central Gaza Strip with explosives, according to the IDF. On Sunday, the Israeli Air Force attacked several terrorists attempting to plant a bomb near IDF troops in northern Gaza. The previous day, an IAF craft struck several Palestinians who had collected a drone flown from Israeli territory into the southern Gaza Strip overnight. On March 6, an IAF craft attacked a group of Palestinian terrorists in northern Gaza who had planted an explosive device near troops. Two days earlier, Israeli forces fired on an individual in the southern Gaza Strip who had approached them, posing an immediate threat. The previous day, Israeli troops fired on a motorboat off the southern Gaza coast near Khan Yunis after it failed to heed warning shots. The first, 42-day phase of the truce with Hamas, which went into effect on Jan. 19, expired on March 1 after the terrorist group rejected a U.S. proposal to extend the truce for 50 days. On March 2, Jerusalem announced it had suspended all humanitarian aid to Gaza. This week, Israel said it would also cut power to the Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that no goods or supplies will enter until further notice, reiterating that Jerusalem will not agree to extend the ceasefire indefinitely without the release of hostages.

The judge who blocked Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil’s depor...	According to a Forward article from 2022, he adjourned court at 4 p.m. on Fridays during the winter fraud trial of lawyer Michael Avenatti because he doesn’t work on Shabbat, which begins at sundown. By Ben Sales, JTA The case of Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian protester arrested by ICE officers at Columbia University over the weekend, has divided Jewish groups: Right-wing pro-Israel voices are praising the arrest as a blow to a terrorist sympathizer, while a range of liberal and progressive Jewish groups are slamming it as authoritarian and unconstitutional. On Monday, one more Jewish voice said Khalil should not be deported, at least for the time being: Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York. Furman, on the bench at a federal district court in Manhattan, issued an order Monday blocking Khalil’s deportation. According to Politico, which posted a copy of Furman’s order online, Furman issued the order so that he will retain jurisdiction over the case. The text reads, 'To preserve the Court’s jurisdiction pending a ruling on the petition, Petitioner [Khalil] shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court orders otherwise.' Trump administration officials have contended that Khalil, who holds a green card, can be deported because his protest activity constitutes support for terrorism. Khalil’s lawyers submitted a writ of habeas corpus challenging the arrest. The parties to the case will meet on Wednesday. Furman, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2012, is an observant Jew. According to a Forward article from 2022, he adjourned court at 4 p.m. on Fridays during the winter fraud trial of lawyer Michael Avenatti because he doesn’t work on Shabbat, which begins at sundown. At another point, he kept the court closed for Rosh Hashanah. (Both cases related to Trump.) 'He is not the first judge on this court by any means to have serious involvement in the Jewish community,' Senior U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff told the Forward at the time, 'but those of us who are Jewish are very admiring of his involvement in that regard.' Furman is married to Ariela Dubler, the head of school at the Abraham Joshua Heschel School, a Jewish day school in Manhattan. The couple has been involved in Ansche Chesed, a Conservative congregation on the Upper West Side. They have also donated to Camp Ramah in the Berkshires, a Conservative Jewish sleepaway camp. Furman’s father Jay was a prominent real estate developer who died in 2015. His mother Gail, who died in 2019, was a psychologist and philanthropist who donated to Democratic causes and headed the Furman Foundation, which gave to progressive groups including the Tides Foundation, a contemporary target of right-wing pro-Israel advocates because of its support for pro-Palestinian groups. Furman’s brother, Jason, is a Harvard University economist who has had his own encounter with the current campus climate. His wife Eve Gerber apologized after being filmed telling a Harvard student wearing a keffiyeh that he was wearing a 'terrorist scarf.' Before becoming a judge, Jesse Furman was an attorney in the Southern District of New York, a high-profile posting where he prosecuted a number of prominent suspects, including employees of Bernie Madoff, who defrauded a long line of Jewish investors and institutions, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the September 11 attacks. The district’s hierarchy was in the news recently when Danielle Sassoon, a Jewish day school graduate and the acting U.S. attorney there, resigned rather than dropping corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams. Adams, whose cooperation with the Trump administration on immigration enforcement was a goal of the administration’s bid to end the corruption case against him, declined to comment on Khalil’s arrest. Furman’s confirmation as a federal judge followed a 65-34 vote in the Senate, where some Republicans objected to his work as an attorney decades earlier on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League, the historic Jewish civil rights group that at the time was supporting a public school’s right to bar a Christian student club. This week, the ADL applauded Khalil’s arrest, provided, it said in its statement, that immigration law would be followed appropriately.

Israeli ambassador rips London college for ‘platforming’ Hamas pr...	Israeli Ambassador to Britain Tzipi Hotovely slams book launch as a 'pro-Hamas gathering' fueling anti-Israel and antisemitic hostility in Britain, while the university defended the event on the grounds of 'free speech and free expression.' By World Israel News Staff The London School of Economics (LSE) has come under fire for hosting the launch of a book accused of being an apologetic for the Hamas terror organization, with Israel’s ambassador to Britain calling on the university to cancel the planned event. The book, Understanding Hamas: And Why It Matters by Rami George Khouri and Helena Cobban, was first published in October 2024 by New York-based OR Books and argues that Hamas has been misrepresented in historical and political discourse. According to Britain’s The Times, on Monday, the authors lamented at a talk hosted by the LSE that Hamas has been 'systematically misrepresented.' Some 100 members of the local Jewish community protested the event. One passage in the book challenges Israeli claims regarding the October 7 attacks, downplaying them as part of a broader justification for Israel's military actions in Gaza. Another section criticizes efforts to 'demonize' Hamas, suggesting that such portrayals hinder peace efforts and exacerbate Palestinian suffering. A week ago, Israeli Ambassador to Britain Tzipi Hotovely penned a letter to LSE President Larry Kramer, warning him that allowing the book’s promotion could increase support for Hamas among students. She noted that Hamas is a 'terrorist organization banned under UK law' and urged the university to reconsider hosting the event. 'There can be no place for platforming Hamas propaganda,' Hotovely said. 'I worry that promoting such a book, which sympathizes with and justifies the survival and existence of Hamas, will only serve to grow support for a brutal terror organization among your students and beyond.' The Campaign Against Antisemitism also condemned the book, arguing that it whitewashes the Islamist terror group’s violent history, which includes suicide bombings and the October 7 massacre that left approximately 1,200 people dead and over 250 in captivity. CAM argued that universities should not provide a stage for narratives that minimize terrorism. Despite the controversy, LSE stood by its decision. A university spokesperson reiterated that LSE 'regularly hosts events that encourage discussion of controversial issues' and that policies are in place to ensure lawful debate and protect participants’ rights. The event’s approval has fueled broader debate on academic responsibility, freedom of speech, and the role of universities in engaging with politically sensitive topics. Critics argue that allowing the event grants legitimacy to a group recognized as a terrorist organization, while supporters maintain that open dialogue is essential to understanding complex geopolitical issues. University officials, however, defended the event, citing the school’s commitment to free speech.

Saudis, Qatar rip Israel over cutting Gaza electricity as UN warn...	Very concerning' - United Nations and Arab states blast Israel over decision to cut off supply of electricity to the Gaza Strip, as part of a deepening siege as Hamas refuses to release additional hostages. By World Israel News Staff Saudi Arabia and Qatar both condemned Israel's decision Monday to halt the flow of electricity from the Israel Electric Corporation to the Gaza Strip. On Monday, energy Minister Eli Cohen (Likud) announced that he had ordered 'the immediate halt of electricity to the Gaza Strip.' While Israel had cut off its supply of power to the coastal enclave in the wake of the October 7th invasion, it later reconnected some public facilities - including desalination and sewage treatment plants. However, after the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas lapsed on March 2nd, with no agreement for an extension in sight and Hamas refusing to release additional hostages, Israel drafted a list of measures to pressure the Gaza terror group. On Tuesday, the Saudi foreign ministry castigated the move, calling it 'collective punishment against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by cutting off electricity to the area.' 'The Kingdom reaffirms its absolute rejection of Israel's violations of international humanitarian law.' The Qatari government also issued a statement condemning the move, which it dubbed a 'blatant violation of international humanitarian law.' The United Nations Human Rights Office also condemned the cutting off of Israeli electricity to Gaza. A spokesman for the office, Seif Magango, told AFP that the move could have 'dire consequences' for Gazans. 'Israel’s decision to cut off electricity to Gaza following its ban last week on the entry of all humanitarian assistance and other necessities of life, including fuel needed to operate generators, is very concerning,' Magango said. 'With no electricity and with fuel being blocked, Gaza’s remaining water desalination plants, healthcare facilities, and bakeries are at risk of eventually shutting down, with dire consequences for civilians.' 'In addition, blocking access to the necessities of life for civilians intended to pressure a party to an armed conflict through hardship imposed on the civilian population as a whole raises serious concerns of collective punishment.'

Pro-Assad Syrians ask Israel to save them from new regime slaught...	Leaders of the Alawite community, which had strongly backed President Bashar Assad, pen letter to Israeli leaders, calling for IDF to intervene in Syria on their behalf against the new regime. By World Israel News Staff Leaders of an ethnic-religious group in Syria aligned with the ousted Assad regime have appealed to Israel to intervene militarily against the new government, after soldiers killed over 1,000 members of the minority group. Since last Thursday, Syrian forces loyal to the new government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Julani, have cracked down on dissidents in the Latakia and Tartus provinces. The two districts have a majority of Alawites, the ethno-religious minority group which ruled Syria for decades under the regimes of Hafez and Bashar Assad. The new government, led by Sunni Islamists, ordered the incursion into the two coastal provinces in response to alleged attacks by supporters of the deposed Assad regime. According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, more than 250 Alawite militia men and 973 civilians have been killed in government reprisals since March 6th. Over 230 regime soldiers have also been killed in the fighting, the SOHR reported. On Monday, i24NEWS reported that Alawite leaders have sent letters to Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and to Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, requesting that Israel take military action to protect the Alawite community. 'Save us from the brutal regime, we will receive you with songs and flowers,' the letter reads in part, while urging the Israeli media to 'shed light on the massacres' in Latakia. In the letter, the Alawite sheikhs lamented that after 'the fall of the Assad regime and the assumption of power in Syria by an extremist Islamic group,' the community has been targeted by the new regime with acts of 'killing, kidnapping, displacement, and intimidation as a method and way to rule and dominate.' The letter’s signatories requested that the Israeli military 'move its planes and forces to protect us,' that the Israeli navy be deployed off Syria’s Mediterranean coast, and that Israel’s government 'raise the issue of crimes against the Alawites at the international level.' 'We say to the Jewish state, we extend our hands to you and we will be your best and most loyal friends, so that you can rid us of this extremist Islamic rule that will be a place for training and preparing groups from which they will launch their fight against you.' 'In the past, you have suffered from the Islamists and known their crimes, and the treacherous terrorists of Islamic terrorism are the best example of the Hamas movement and terrorism as an example of terrorism and terror. And the Hamas movement is establishing a base in Syria that will be a launching point for action against you.' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar condemned al-Sharaa over the killings, calling in an interview with Germany’s Bild newspaper for Europe not to 'misread reality' or overlook the massacre in Latakia and Tartus. Alawite leaders noted Sa’ar’s comments in their letter. 'We would like to thank Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar for his words about the Alawites and the revenge and harm they are subjected to, something no Arab, Islamic, or international foreign minister has ever done.' Considered a sect within Shi’ite Islam, the Alawites also compromise a unique ethnic group within Syria’s Arab population, making up roughly 12% of Syria’s 25 million residents. Like the Druze, Syria’s Alawite community formed an autonomous state within the French Mandate for Syria during the 1920s and 1930s, spanning the Tartus and Latakia regions, before it was forcibly incorporated into the Syrian Arab Republican in 1936.

Syria’s Alawite minority calls for Israeli intervention, vows fri...	Leaders of the Alawite community, which had strongly backed President Bashar Assad, pen letter to Israeli leaders, calling for IDF to intervene in Syria on their behalf against the new regime. By World Israel News Staff Leaders of an ethnic-religious group in Syria aligned with the ousted Assad regime have appealed to Israel to intervene military against the new government, after soldiers killed over 1,000 members of the minority group. Since last Thursday, Syrian forces loyal to the new government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Julani, have cracked down on dissidents in the Latakia and Tartus provinces. The two districts have a majority of Alawites, the ethno-religious minority group which ruled Syria for decades under the regimes of Hafez and Bashar Assad. The new government, led by Sunni Islamists, ordered the incursion into the two coastal provinces in response to alleged attacks by supporters of the deposed Assad regime. According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, more than 250 Alawite militia men and 973 civilians have been killed in government reprisals. Over 230 regime soldiers have also been killed in the fighting, the SOHR reported. On Monday, i24NEWS reported that Alawite leaders had sent letters to Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and to Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, requesting that Israel take military action to protect the Alawite community.

Rubio meets with Saudi prince to discuss future of Gaza Strip	Hamas must have no role' in post-war Gaza, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio tells Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during visit to Saudi kingdom. By World Israel News Staff United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Monday evening, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the oil-rich Sunni kingdom's de facto ruler. The two held a closed-door meeting, with President Donald Trump's National Security Advisor Mike Waltz also attending. During the summit, the three Rubio reviewed 'various aspects of Saudi-US relations and explored opportunities to further strengthen cooperation,' the Saudi foreign ministry said after the meeting, providing few details. Rubio, Waltz, and the Crown Prince also discussed 'regional and international developments and exchanged views and efforts aimed at achieving security and stability.' In a statement released Monday night, State Department Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce elaborated that the three discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine, threats to international shipping in the Red Sea from Houthi forces in Yemen, and the ongoing unrest in Syria. In addition, Waltz, Rubio, and bin Salman spoke about the future of the Gaza Strip, its post-war governance, and the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the war-torn coastal enclave. 'The Secretary thanked the Crown Prince for once again hosting the United States in talks to help resolve the Ukraine war and secure a lasting peace,' Bruce said. Following Rubio's visit, Crown Prince bin Salman hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for talks on the war with Russia. 'The leaders discussed Yemen and threats to navigation from Houthi terrorists that threaten global commerce, American interests, and Saudi citizens and infrastructure,' Bruce continued. 'The Secretary talked about Syria, and ways to promote a stable government, free of terrorism.' Regarding the talks on the future of the Gaza Strip, the State Department did not offer details, nor mention the Saudi government's stated opposition to President Donald Trump's Gaza resettlement plan. In her statement, Bruce merely noted that the two 'discussed reconstruction in Gaza,' and that Rubio 'reiterated the United States firm commitment that any solution to the situation in Gaza must not include any role for Hamas.'

Reuters falsely accuses murdered terror victim of being Mossad ag...	The news agency retracts claim, based on false comments by terrorist's family, that Israeli man murdered by terrorists was a Mossad agent. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The UK-based news agency Reuters pulled an article Thursday that had falsely accused a murdered Israeli man of being a Mossad agent, after receiving many complaints for not checking the facts. The article, published last month, sympathetically portrayed the Gazan mother of terrorist Diaa El Agha, giving her a platform to say how much she missed her son, who was not among the nearly 2,000 security prisoners being gradually released by Israel in exchange for 33 hostages held by Hamas and other terror organizations. El Agha was 17 when imprisoned in 1992 for killing a civilian, Amatzia Ben-Haim, by bludgeoning him with a gardening tool. However, the Reuters article described Ben-Haim as a Mossad agent four times, including in the subheadings, based solely on the family’s claim. This was completely untrue, as Ben-Haim, a father of three, was an employee of a kibbutz factory that produced irrigation systems. When attacked, he had been fixing a broken system in a greenhouse of one of the Jewish settlements that existed in the Gaza Strip before all of them were forcibly evacuated by the Israeli government in the 2005 Disengagement. Ben-Haim had never served in Israel’s spy service, having done his duty to his country in the army and reserves as a member of the elite Sayeret Matkal commando force. This information was publicly available, including on Israel’s National Insurance website. The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (CAMERA), complained to Reuters, as did many of its members, and took credit for the retraction. In its press release on the subject, CAMERA also criticized the fact that the report 'referred to Hamas simply as a ‘militant’ group,' when it has been designated as a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. as well as other Western nations. It additionally pointed out as 'strange' that the article, called 'Gaza mother's hopes for return of long-jailed son dashed,' did not mention Ben-Haim’s name at all, and only in passing noted how he was murdered. The group concluded that the story was purposely slanted to 'conceal the fact that Diaa El Agha murdered a civilian, so that readers are more inclined to sympathize' with his mother. In its statement regarding the retracted article, the news agency said, 'A Reuters story about a Palestinian mother's wait for the release of her long-jailed son, who was convicted of killing an Israeli, is withdrawn.' 'Reuters has been unable to verify a link between the victim and Israel's Mossad spy agency, as stated by the Palestinian prisoner's family,' it continued. 'There will be no substitute version.'

Meta deletes terror-linked influencer’s Instagram for violating ‘...	Despite presenting himself as a 'journalist,' Al Jafarawi has been a key figure in Gazan propaganda, appearing in multiple staged videos—dubbed 'Pallywood' by critics. By Jewish Breaking News Meta has permanently deleted the Instagram accounts of Saleh Al Jafarawi, known online as 'Mr. FAFO,' for violating its policies against dangerous individuals and organizations. With 5.5 million followers on Instagram and a total reach, Al Jafarawi has been one of Gaza’s most prominent propagandists throughout the Israel-Hamas war. His accounts, which routinely praised Hamas and glorified the October 7 massacre, was shut down. ‘FAFO’ No More: Al Jafarawi’s Fall from Social Media Prominence Al Jafarawi gained notoriety for his early celebratory videos following the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel, which left over 1,200 people murdered and hundreds taken hostage. However, his tone quickly shifted as Israel’s counteroffensive intensified, and he began posting videos of himself crying and expressing fear for his life. This transformation led to his infamous nickname: 'Mr. FAFO' (F* Around and Find Out). Despite presenting himself as a 'journalist,' Al Jafarawi has been a key figure in Gazan propaganda, appearing in multiple staged videos—dubbed 'Pallywood' by critics—where he was seen playing different roles, including: • A grieving foster father • A heroic surgeon • A 'freedom fighter' • A war correspondent • A radiology technician • A supposed civilian casualty—seen moving in a body bag etc. His online presence remained strong despite numerous calls for deplatforming, but Meta’s final decision to remove both of his accounts means he can no longer spread Hamas-aligned propaganda on Instagram. Listed as ‘Martyred’ Despite Being Alive Adding to the controversy, Al Jafarawi is listed as a 'martyr' on the website OurGaza, though no date of death is recorded. His profile claims he was killed in an Israeli raid on Al-Shifa Hospital, a Hamas stronghold disguised as a civilian medical facility. However, he continued posting after the supposed date of his death, raising further questions about his credibility. In a now-deleted January post on X/Twitter, he boasted about sitting on the same couch where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was supposedly 'martyred.' Meta’s Crackdown on Pro-Hamas Propaganda Meta’s removal of Al Jafarawi’s accounts comes as part of its broader effort to crack down on terrorist propaganda and accounts that promote violence. According to the company’s Dangerous Individuals and Organizations Policy, any account that glorifies, supports, or represents designated terror groups is subject to removal. Al Jafarawi’s removal from Instagram is a major blow to Hamas’s online influence, as he can no longer spread his propaganda to millions of followers. While his supporters may attempt to resurrect his presence on alternative platforms, Meta’s decision signals a clear zero-tolerance stance against terror-linked influencers. As for Mr. FAFO, it seems he finally found out.

Israeli government allowing UNRWA to continue operating despite l...	MK Yulia Malinovsky calls out those who are not stopping UNRWA activities, which are now against the law. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The United Nations agency charged with providing relief to Palestinians, and barred from operating in Israel over the agency's links to terrorist groups including Hamas, continues to function in Israel, a Knesset Member from the Opposition has claimed. One of the MKs who initiated the law barring the United Nations Relief Works Agency (UNRWA) from working in Israel due to its collaboration with Hamas has charged government ministers with not upholding the law and thereby cooperating with terrorism. MK Yulia Malinvosky was very specific in her criticism. 'Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich did not sign an order instructing the Bank of Israel to close UNRWA's accounts in banks operating in Israel,' she wrote, and 'Infrastructure and Energy Minister Eli Cohen did not give instructions to disconnect UNRWA facilities from electricity and water networks.' Both these actions could indirectly speed up the agency’s departure, but even more direct action could be taken and Malinovsky mentioned them as well. 'Minister of Education Yoav Kisch did not send his staff to close UNRWA schools operating in Jerusalem, contrary to the law,' she wrote, while 'Health Minister Uriel Busso did not order the closure of UNRWA clinics and pharmacies in Jerusalem.' In addition, 'Minister of Housing and Construction Yitzhak Goldknopf did not give orders to empty the UNRWA compound in Ma'alot Dafna in Jerusalem.' The Opposition parliamentarian from the Israeli Beiteinu party even called out Transportation Minister Miri Regev, who, she said, did not instruct her office 'to revoke the vehicle licenses registered in UNRWA's name.' 'So who will be the next scapegoat for the incompetence of this government of dishrags?' she asked sarcastically. 'The Attorney General? The head of the Shabak? The Supreme Court, or perhaps the new Chief of Staff?' The law banning UNRWA operations within Israeli territory, including Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria, passed overwhelmingly in October with a 92-10 vote. It also prohibits the organization's staff from operating in or entering Gaza. The aim was to dismantle the agency that provides aid to Palestinians but has been documented encouraging indoctrination against peace with Israel in its schools for decades, having hundreds on its payroll who are members of terror groups, some of whom participated in the October 7, 2023 invasion, and allowing Hamas to build terror tunnels underneath – and use – its facilities in the Gaza Strip. The government was given three months to implement the law, but little was done except for ordering the UNRWA in late January to vacate its main headquarters in Jerusalem and cease its operations. Malinovsky stated just a few days later that she would not rest until UNRWA was completely gone. 'I will pursue them like Elie Wiesel pursued the Nazis, because they are Nazis,' she said while standing in front of the shuttered compound. 'This organization is a Nazi organization that supports terrorism and we know the examples.' 'The Foreign Ministry is still living in La La Land that this is an organization that has diplomatic immunity,' she added, saying that 'The State of Israel will first and foremost take care of its own national interests, its sovereignty and its national pride.' In mid-February, Malinovsky sent a warning letter to the Prime minister and other senior government officials that she would petition the High Court of Justice over their failure to apply the anti-UNRWA law.

Why do people really exercise? Israeli AI study reveals surprisin...	The researchers found that 30% of participants rely on creating regular workout habits, such as exercising at specific times each day or on a particular day of the week. By Pesach Benson, TPS People who exercise are more likely to be concerned about their appearance than about their health, Israeli scientists said on Monday. Using artificial intelligence tools, a team of researchers from Tel Aviv University analyzed thousands of posts on the Reddit social network to identify the key drivers behind exercise habits. While physical health is often cited as a reason for exercising, the data showed that a significant portion of participants are more concerned with their appearance. Specifically, 23.9% of individuals who engage in sports do so to improve their looks, while only 18.9% exercise to maintain or improve their health. A further 16.9% exercise for mental health reasons. 'This is an astonishing phenomenon,' said Prof. Yftach Gepner, one of the lead researchers from TAU’s School of Public Health. 'Science tells us that just over two hours a week of physical activity can prevent 30% of diseases, improve quality of life, and extend lifespan; and yet, less than a quarter of the population actually does this. Why? What have we failed to see?' Gepner said that understanding these motivations is crucial for encouraging people to exercise and improve their overall health. The problem, he explained, is that previous research in the field relied on outdated questionnaires, which often include inherent biases. Instead, this study used a more accurate method by examining real-world data from social media, providing a clearer picture of the true reasons people engage in physical activity. 'In questionnaires, people claim they want to be healthy, but in reality, they want six-pack abs,' said Gepner. 'These findings are important because they teach us how to address the public, how to persuade people to get off the couch, promote health, and prevent disease.' In addition to uncovering the motivations behind exercise, the study also looked into the strategies that people use to maintain physical activity. The researchers found that 30% of participants rely on creating regular workout habits, such as exercising at specific times each day or on a particular day of the week. Other strategies included setting personal goals like losing weight or running a specific distance (13.9%), enjoying the activity itself (12.1%), socializing during workouts (9.7%), using media such as workout videos (8.9%), using fitness apps (2.8%), and even making financial commitments to stay active (2.5%). 'The results are quite significant,' said Prof. Gepner. 'One strategy is more successful and therefore more recommended than others—creating exercise habits.' He emphasized that developing regular habits is the most effective way to stay healthy. 'If you want to be healthier, you need to develop healthy habits, period. Instead of a morning cigarette, drink two glasses of water and go out for a run.' The study was recently published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Rubio condemns mass killings of Alawites in Syria, says US stands...	According to Syrian officials, the fighting started when a group of Alawite fighters loyal to Assad killed their forces in a premeditated attack. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday denounced the mass killing of more than 1,000 people, mostly civilians from the Alawite minority group, in Syria, calling on the newly installed Syrian government to hold the perpetrators 'accountable' for the massacres. 'The United States condemns the radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis, that murdered people in western Syria in recent days,' Rubio said in a statement. 'The United States stands with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities, and offers its condolences to the victims and their families. Syria’s interim authorities must hold the perpetrators of these massacres against Syria’s minority communities accountable.' In a series of clashes beginning on Thursday, fighters allied with the new Syrian government carried out mass executions of Alawite Muslim civilians in the coastal towns of Latakia and Tartus. According to Syria’s interior ministry, the pro-government fighters conducted 'sweeping operations' in the towns to dismantle the remaining 'remnants' of the regime of former President Bashaar al-Assad, targeting primarily adult men. According to Syrian officials, the fighting started when a group of Alawite fighters loyal to Assad killed their forces in a premeditated attack. The ensuing mass killing of Alawites, who comprise roughly 10 percent of the Syrian population, highlights growing concerns over the safety of minority groups in the country. Syria’s interim President Ahmed Sharaa decried the massacres, claiming they undermined his efforts to unite the country and vowing to seek retribution for the violence. 'Syria is a state of law. The law will take its course on all,' Sharaa told Reuters. 'We fought to defend the oppressed, and we won’t accept that any blood be shed unjustly, or goes without punishment or accountability, even among those closest to us.' In late January, Sharaa became Syria’s transitional president after leading a rebel campaign that ousted Assad, whose decades-long Iran-backed rule had strained ties with the Arab world during the nearly 14-year Syrian war. The collapse of Assad’s regime was the result of an offensive spearheaded by Sharaa’s Sunni Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group, a former al-Qaeda affiliate. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz denounced the Syrian president as a 'terrorist' who 'switched his robe for a suit and presented a moderate face.' 'Now he’s taken off the mask and exposed his true face: A jihadist terrorist of the al-Qaeda school who is committing horrifying acts against a civilian population,' Katz said in a statement. 'Israel will defend itself against any threat from Syria.' Following Assad’s fall in December, Israel moved troops into a buffer zone along the Syrian border to secure a military position to prevent terrorists from launching attacks against the Jewish state. The previously demilitarized zone in the Golan Heights was established under the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement between Damascus and Jerusalem that ended the Yom Kippur War. However, Israel considered the agreement void after the collapse of Assad’s regime. Syria’s new government has called for Israel to withdraw its forces. Alawite leaders in Syria have also issued a statement to Israel, calling on the Jewish state to deploy forces in the country to protect its minority civilians. 'Following the fall of Assad’s regime, and after the massacres that took place in Alawite areas against our people, we call on the Israeli government to provide protection, assistance, and support,' the leaders wrote, according to i24 News. The leaders lamented that 'the world is silent about the massacres happening in Syria' and that if the Jewish state offered help, the Alawite Muslims 'will be your most loyal and good friends.'

Israeli airstrikes cripple Syrian radar network	IDF confirms Israeli warplanes bombed Syrian military targets, including radar systems and aerial intel facilities, to 'eliminate future threats.' By World Israel News Staff Israeli jets bombed multiple military positions in southern Syria before dawn Tuesday morning, an IDF spokesperson confirmed. According to the Israeli military, Israeli Air Force fighter jets operating overnight struck radar systems and detection equipment in southern Syria used for constructing an aerial intelligence picture. The Israeli fighter jets also bombed local Syrian army headquarters and military sites containing weaponry and military equipment belonging to the new regime in southern Syria. 'The presence of these assets in southern Syria poses a threat to the State of Israel and to IDF operations,' the Israeli army said. 'These targets were attacked to eliminate future threats.' According to a report by the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the Israeli airstrikes were carried out in the vicinity of Sa'sa, in the Qatana district near the Golan Heights, and in the Daraa Governate, east of the Golan. There were no immediate reports of casualties or details regarding damage to the Syrian military. The SOHR report claimed that the Israeli airstrikes were accompanied by a ground incursion, led by an armored IDF force, into the area of Ma'ariya (Umm Sharq) om the Yarmouk Basin in the western edge of the Daraa Governate, near the Golan Heights. There was no indication the IDF forces withdrew from the area. According to the SOHR, Israel has carried out 22 Israeli airstrikes in Syria since the beginning of 2025, targeting ammunition depots, military headquarters, radar stations, and army vehicles. The IDF carried out roughly 500 airstrikes in Syria immediately after the fall of the Assad regime on December 8th, 2024, through the end of the year.

‘Learning from Oct. 7th’ – IDF cancels holiday leave for soldiers	There will be no more shutdowns in the IDF,' says new Chief-of-Staff Eyal Zamir. By World Israel News Staff New IDF Chief-of-Staff Eyal Zamir has cancelled a long-standing IDF policy of granting large swathes of soldiers leave during holidays, saying that the practice had created vulnerabilities that contributed to the October 7th massacres. 'There will be no more shutdowns in the IDF,' Zamir said during a meeting with senior commanders, according to reports from several Hebrew-language outlets. He noted that individual soldiers would still be able to take leave and furloughs, just not in a manner that endangers the security and operational ability of entire bases and units. Zamir also added that '2025 will be a year of war' for the Israeli military and that returning the hostages is a top priority for the IDF. Prior to October 7th, it was common for entire units and the majority of soldiers at military bases to be simultaneously granted leave for the Jewish holidays. This saw only a fraction of the standard operating crew in place, leaving bases vulnerable to infiltrations and seriously disrupting operations, especially during emergency situations. The IDF was in such a 'shutdown' period on October 7th, which occurred at the end of the weeklong Sukkot festival and on the day of the Simchat Torah holiday. Less than half the usual number of soldiers were stationed along the Gaza border on that day, a fact that was well-understood by Hamas leadership. According to an internal probe of the military's failings on October 7th, slain Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar reportedly chose the date for the attack because he knew the amount of soldiers on base was drastically reduced on Jewish holidays and Shabbats. Zamir recently ordered a surprise drill to test the IDF's ability to fend off base infiltrations, according to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. Additionally, Zamir was reported to have ordered a surprise review of the Northern Command's operational abilities.

Aid to Gaza or ‘Tel Aviv under fire,’ Houthi leader threatens	Military measures will be carried out from the moment the deadline expires - if aid does not enter the Gaza Strip,' says Houthi leader. By World Israel News Staff Israel is preparing for renewed attacks from the Houthis in Yemen, after the terror group announced it would resume targeting the Jewish State until humanitarian aid is transferred into Gaza. 'We are committed to our position regarding the ultimatum we set for Israel regarding the resumption of aid to the Gaza Strip,' said Abdul-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi, who last week said that Israel had until Tuesday to allow the entry of aid, in a media statement. 'Our forces are ready to carry out operations. Military measures will be carried out from the moment the deadline expires - if aid does not enter the Gaza Strip.' In a televised speech, al-Houthi said that Israel's 'refusal to withdraw from [the Philadelphi corridor] represents a serious breach of the agreement,' he said. 'If the war in Gaza resumes, the entire Zionist entity, starting with Tel Aviv, will be under fire. We will intervene and provide support through various military means,' he added. Senior Houthi official Nasser al-Din Amer on his X account that 'our eyes are on Gaza, our hands are on the trigger, and our missiles, drones and all military units are on high alert. The directive from our leader&#8230;is clear.' The Iranian proxy group has long claimed its attacks on Israel, which began shortly after the October 7th Hamas-led massacres, are an act of support for the Palestinians. Throughout the Israel-Hamas war, the Houthis launched some one hundred attacks, including dozens of explosive drones and ballistic missiles at civilian areas in the Jewish State. One drone killed a man in Tel Aviv, while the missile attacks struck parks, schools, and other civilian assets, creating extensive damage, but no casualties. The Houthis announced they were ceasing their attacks after Israel and Hamas declared a ceasefire in January. Following the end of the first stage of the ceasefire, negotiations on the second phase have stalled. Hamas has yet to release any more Israeli hostages, triggering Israel to amp up pressure on the terror group by refusing to allow additional humanitarian aid into the Strip. According to Israeli and international sources, the vast majority of humanitarian aid is usurped by Hamas, and the terror group has vast stockpiles of food, medicines, and other supplies that will last them for several months.

Hamas may free Edan Alexander as ‘goodwill gesture’ to Trump	Alexander's father, Adi, said that he supported the direct negotiations between the Trump administration and Hamas. By World Israel News Staff Hamas is considering releasing IDF solider Edan Alexander, who holds American citizenship, as a gesture of goodwill towards President Donald Trump. The terror group would also free Alexander, who was kidnapped from an army base adjacent to the Gaza Strip on October 7th, without a public ceremony. 'We are open to releasing American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander as part of the talks to end the war in Gaza,' a Hamas source told Al-Aqsa TV, a channel controlled by the terror group, on Sunday. In a separate statement, a member of Hamas' politburo confirmed that there are ongoing negotiations that may see Alexander freed in the near future. 'Several meetings have already taken place in Doha, focusing on releasing one of the dual-nationality prisoners. We have dealt positively and flexibly, in a way that serves the interests of the Palestinian people,' Hamas political official Taher Al-Nono told Reuters. 'We informed the American delegation that we don't oppose the release of the prisoner within the framework of these talks,' he added. According to various reports, Hamas may free Alexander as a signal to Washington that it is being cooperative and is willing to continue the ceasefire with Israel. Speaking to ABC News, Alexander's father, Adi, said that he supported the direct negotiations between the Trump administration and Hamas. 'I think it was a very brave move and a correct move,' he told the outlet. He stressed that Israel 'must return to the bargaining table, keep talking, and get everybody home.' The father said he is 'really hopeful' after hearing information from recently released hostages that confirmed he was still alive and in relatively good health. Other hostages said they witnessed Edan attempting to help abducted Thai workers, explaining to their Hamas captors that the agricultural laborers, who were kidnapped from kibbutzes near Gaza, were not Israeli nationals. Alexander, 21, was born in Tel Aviv but immigrated to New Jersey as a child. He is the last American hostage believed to be alive. The bodies of four American citizens are still being held by Hamas. The families of Omer Neutra and Itai Chen, who were serving in the IDF at the time of their murders and abduction, along with Judy Weinstein-Haggai (who also held Canadian citizenship) and her husband, Gadi Haggai, are advocating for the return of their bodies.

Israeli-American nurse found dead in Montana	33-year-old Israeli-American nurse's body recovered more than two weeks after she went missing at a park in Montana. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli-American woman living in Colorado was found dead this week in Montana, more than two weeks after she went missing. On February 21st, 33-year-old Danit Ehrlich disappeared after traveling to a dog park in Missoula, Montana, near the University of Montana. Local authorities and a Jewish search and rescue group contracted by the Ehrlich family scoured the banks of the Clark Fork River, amid fears Danit had drowned while hiking in the area. Those fears were confirmed this week, when Ehrlich's remains were discovered in the Clark Fork River. On Sunday afternoon, a passerby spotted a body in the river and notified local authorities. After the body was recovered by first responders, a coroner's examination confirmed that the remains belonged to Ehrlich. Ehrlich had taking her dog, Bamba, out hiking by the river, with her father, Simon Ehrlich, speculating that his daughter drowned while trying to rescue Bamba from the icy river. 'She was a lovely, lovely girl. She really, she touched people,' Simon told CBS News. 'Her dog was her life. Her dog was her life,' said Simon. 'They traveled together, they hiked together.' 'We have her last steps in the snow with the steps of the dog.' 'We as parents, we are not surprised that she just jumped in. Don't even think twice. That's my dog. That's my baby.' Bamba has not been located. Born in Miami, Ehrlich had relocated to Colorado and worked as a nurse in Lutheran Hospital near Denver. Ehrlich had recently left Lutheran Hospital, working as a traveling nurse, with plans to relocate to Tacoma, Washington for a new job. When she failed to show up in Tacoma, however, her family began to worry. 'We started making phone calls to her, and she didn't answer,' Simon said. 'Something is wrong.' In a statement shared with CBS Colorado, Ehrlich's boyfriend called her a 'caring woman,' and said he was 'broken to know the truth.' 'I didn't realize how much I was hanging on to the small sliver of hope I had about her possibly being alive. It brings closure and it brings a sense of finality.'

Trans rock star’s performance at Bernie Sanders rally slammed as ...	The song described a series of sexual acts involving God. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A trans rock star was criticized as 'pure evil' following a performance at a Bernie Sanders rally during which he made sexually explicit references to God. Laura Jane Grace, the singer and guitarist of punk band Against Me!, proudly shared footage of her solo performance opening for the far-left senator in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Friday night. During the set, she performed a new song titled 'Your God (God’s D–k).' She sang: 'Does your god have a big fat d–k? Cause it feels like he’s f–king me.' 'When he whips out his meat does your world fall to its knees?' she sang. The song continued describing a series of sexual acts involving God. Libs of TikTok shared video clips of the performance, calling it 'absolutely sickening.' 'This is who the Democrats are now. Pure evil,' conservative social media activist Robby Starbuck wrote on X. 'Other lyrics are somehow even more grotesque and anti-Christian. These people are insane.' Another commenter reacted with, 'God will not be mocked.' Even Democrats called out the performance, acknowledging it crossed a line. One wrote, 'I spent much of my life as a moderate Dem. It’s hard to express how ashamed and disappointed I am in these people now. What has happened these last few years may not ever be undone. Inexcusable.' Another said that 'little Bernie has gone full Satan, right before our eyes! What kind of singer even writes this on paper let alone sings it in front of an audience?' Grace has been performing since 1997 when she was still identifying as a male then called Thomas James Gabel. Grace has long been a supporter of Bernie Sanders and performed in support the senator in 2020. During the 2020 performance, Grace sang about cross burnings, white supremacists and automatic weapons. 'God is good and God is great, now get the f–k out of the USA,' she sang in her song Hanging Tree.

As hostage negotiations begin in Doha, Witkoff says ‘We need dead...	Special Envoy Witkoff: 'Trump has had enough. This has to happen. The way these hostages are being held is unacceptable.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As Israeli negotiators arrived in Doha to discuss the release of hostages, U.S. President Donald Trump's special Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff remarked that deadlines were needed to prevent an impasse in talks. The Israeli delegation arrived on Monday afternoon and communicated indirectly with Hamas through mediators. The discussion will center on a proposal put forward by Witkoff, and the special envoy is expected to arrive on Tuesday or Wednesday. Witkoff told Fox News, 'We need deadlines' for the next stage of the hostage release and ceasefire deal and added, 'Trump has had enough. This has to happen. The way these hostages are being held is unacceptable.' The envoy described the condition of the freed hostages as 'deplorable' and 'unacceptable,' adding, 'Many of them came out sick; they hadn’t eaten, and they didn’t receive medical care. It’s a terrible situation for them. It’s just unacceptable.' Hamas rejected Witkoff's proposal and insisted on moving to the second phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, which requires a commitment from Israel to end the war and completely withdraw the IDF from the Gaza Strip. 'We reaffirm our full commitment to the ceasefire agreement and its implementation, and we are ready to immediately begin negotiations for the second phase,' the terrorist group said. Hamas accused Israel of 'evasion' and 'delay' and laid the blame on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the ongoing crisis. In a statement, Hamas said, 'We reject any attempts to pressure Hamas while the occupying power evades its obligations without consequence. The use of extortion and threats of war will not succeed. The only path forward is through negotiations and strict adherence to the agreement. Any deviation puts the prisoners’ future at risk.' The U.S. took an unprecedented step last week by negotiating directly with Hamas, a move that provoked the displeasure of the Israeli government. Trump's hostage envoy, Adam Boehler, met directly with Hamas, although Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the talks as a 'one-off' occasion and stated they 'had not borne fruit.' Israeli officials were shocked by the move, particularly because the Israeli government was not informed of the direct meetings until after they occurred.

Sec. of State Rubio admits US direct talks with Hamas ‘haven’t bo...	The Israeli government was displeased with the direct negotiations, particularly because Israeli officials were informed of the talks only after they occurred. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the controversial direct talks between Trump's hostage envoy, Adam Boehler, and Hamas officials were a 'one-off' situation and 'hadn't borne fruit.' 'That was a one-off situation in which our special envoy for hostages, whose job it is to secure the release of hostages, had an opportunity to talk directly to someone who has control over these people and was given permission and encouraged to do so. He did so,' Rubio told reporters while traveling to Saudi Arabia. 'As of now, it hasn’t borne fruit. That doesn’t mean he was wrong to try, but our primary vehicle for negotiations on this front will continue to be Mr. Witkoff and the work he’s doing through Qatar,' Rubio added, referring to Trump’s special envoy for the Middle East, Steven Witkoff. Witkoff is flying to Qatar for continued talks on an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. Shortly before departing, Witkoff declared that Hamas must leave the Gaza Strip. 'There’s no logical or rational choice for them other than to leave. If they leave, then I think all things are on the table for a negotiated peace deal, and that’s what they’re going to need to do,' Witkoff said. The talks are proceeding following controversy last week over Trump's hostage envoy Adam Boehler's meeting with Hamas officials. The Israeli government was displeased with the direct negotiations, particularly because Israeli officials were informed of the talks only after they occurred, contrary to U.S. officials’ claims that Israel had been fully briefed. The U.S. chose not to inform Israel of the meeting between Trump’s hostage envoy, Adam Boehler, and Hamas ahead of time because a similar meeting had previously been canceled due to Israeli opposition. Boehler proceeded with the meeting, focusing on the need to secure the release of American hostage Eden Alexander and the remains of four deceased U.S. citizens: Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai, and Judith Weinstein. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposed the idea of direct talks between the U.S. and Hamas when proposed by the Trump administration last month. According to Ynet, Israel was behind the leak of the direct negotiations between the U.S. and Hamas in an attempt to prevent them. On Sunday, however, Netanyahu reassured his cabinet that his government and the Trump administration had reached an understanding on the issue, resolving the diplomatic row. According to a report by Israel’s national broadcaster, Kan, Netanyahu told ministers that the Trump administration had agreed to coordinate its diplomatic efforts with Jerusalem regarding Hamas.

Syria’s al-Sharaa: Israel ‘last ones who can talk’ about atrociti...	The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 745 civilians, 125 government security force members and 148 militants from armed groups affiliated with the Assad regime had been killed. By JNS Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has dismissed Israel’s criticism of mass killings blamed on his regime as 'nonsense,' Reuters reported on Monday. 'They are the last ones who can talk,' Al-Sharaa, the country’s de facto leader, also known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Julani, charged in a wide-ranging interview with the news agency. According to Reuters, Al-Sharaa accused the Jewish state of killing 'tens of thousands of people' during its wars against Iranian-backed terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon over the past 18 months. The massacres taking place in Syria have reignited concerns over the Sunni Islamist government that overthrew Bashar Assad in December. More than a thousand people have been killed in the coastal provinces of Tartus and Latakia, with some 700 civilians executed at close range. Al-Sharaa’s government has denied responsibility for the killings, calling the accusations 'undocumented.' Local human rights groups have also reported Assad loyalists killing members of Al-Sharaa’s security forces. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 745 civilians, 125 government security force members and 148 terrorists from armed groups affiliated with the Assad regime had been killed. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated earlier on Monday that 'Al-Julani took off his jalabiya, put on a suit, and presented a moderate facade. 'Now, he has removed the mask, revealing his true face: a jihadist terrorist from the Al-Qaeda school, committing atrocities against the Alawite civilian population,' Katz wrote in a post on social media. Al-Sharaa was a leading figure in Al-Qaeda before founding Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which led the overthrow of the Assad regime last year. Katz said Israel would 'ensure that southern Syria remains demilitarized and free of threats, and we will protect the local Druze population,' warning that 'anyone who harms them will face our response.' Also on Monday, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar criticized European leaders for their willingness to engage with Al-Sharaa. 'Europeans flocked to Damascus in recent months to shake his hand, but he and his men were jihadists and have remained so, even if they now wear suits,' Sa’ar stated, urging the international community to condemn what he described as the 'barbaric murder of civilians.'

Trump admin replaces Biden’s migrant entry app with a migrant sel...	By the end of Joe Biden's term, around one million migrants had entered the country through the CBP One app. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon The Trump administration has transformed the Biden-era 'CBP One' app, which allowed migrants to apply for asylum in the United States from their home countries, into 'CBP Home,' a platform aimed at streamlining the self-deportation of illegal immigrants. CBP Home will automatically replace CBP One on users' devices, and the Department of Homeland Security can use CBP One registration to track migrants. Those opting to self-deport can submit their biographical details—including citizenship, intended departure country, contact information, and a photo for identity verification—to Customs and Border Protection, according to Fox News's Bill Melugin. The move marks a major shift in policy. The Biden administration used CBP One to process migrants at ports of entry, facilitating their asylum requests and parole into the United States. By the end of Joe Biden's term, around one million migrants had entered the country through the app, the Washington Free Beacon reported. President Donald Trump ended the program on his first day back in office. 'The CBP Home app gives aliens the option to leave now and self-deport, so they may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream,' Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a statement to Fox News. 'If they don't, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return,' Noem warned, noting that the new platform is 'restoring integrity to our immigration system.' Self-deportation significantly reduces costs for federal immigration authorities, freeing up resources to focus on removing criminal aliens, according to the DHS. Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement since returning to the White House. Migrant encounters at the southern border have dropped to the lowest level since 2017. A total of 42,048 illegal migrants were removed from the United States between January 21 and February 18, according to Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen.

Witkoff: ‘No alternative’ for Hamas but to exit Gaza	The Trump administration is pushing for a deal that would secure the release of all remaining hostages, extend the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, and potentially lead to a long-term truce. By JNS Hamas must leave the Gaza Strip, Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, told Fox News on Monday, shortly before flying to Qatar for continued talks on a Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. Witkoff said of the terrorist group that has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007 that it must demilitarize, disarm and depart. 'There’s no logical or rational choice for them other than to leave. If they leave, then I think all things are on the table for a negotiated peace deal, and that’s what they’re going to need to do,' Witkoff said. Of the hostages, he said the conditions in which they’re being kept is unacceptable. 'We’ve interviewed all the hostages who have been released. The conditions are deplorable. … They’re sick. They haven’t eaten. They haven’t been given medical care. It’s it’s a terrible proposition for them,' he said. The Trump administration is pushing for a deal that would secure the release of all remaining hostages, extend the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, and potentially lead to a long-term truce. Several meetings have taken place between leaders of Hamas and U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Adam Boehler, Taher al-Nono, a senior official with the terrorist group, confirmed to Reuters on Sunday. Witkoff will arrive in Qatar on Tuesday. He praised the Qatari mediators and also the Egyptians. Qatar, which has supported Muslim Brotherhood groups, including Hamas, and allowed Hamas leaders to live freely in the country, accused Israel of 'aggressive policies' on Saturday. An Israeli delegation will also travel to Qatar. 'Israel has accepted the invitation of the mediators backed by the United States,' the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said. Hamas is holding 59 hostages, with the Israel Defense Forces confirming 35 are dead. Israeli intelligence believes 22 are alive, while the status of two remains uncertain. Among the captives are five Americans, including 21-year-old Edan Alexander, who is believed to be alive. The terrorist group has called for immediate talks on the second phase of its agreement with Israel. A delegation met in Cairo with Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Mahmoud Rashad on Saturday to discuss enforcing the ceasefire and conducting hostage-for-terrorists exchanges. Hamas stressed the need to fulfill all terms of the deal, ensure unrestricted aid flows into Gaza, which it has confiscated to continue fighting, and establish an independent committee to govern Gaza until elections are held.

Voting opens in election for World Zionist Congress, with future ...	The results will impact key issues such as religious pluralism, funding for Jewish education, settlement expansion, and Israel-Diaspora relations. By Asaf Elia-Shalev, JTA Voting opens Monday in an election that gives American Jews a rare chance to directly shape Israel’s future. The U.S. election for seats in the 39th World Zionist Congress will help determine the balance of power in the legislative authority of a Zionist organization founded by Theodore Herzl 128 years ago. Influence over $5 billion in funding for Jewish causes is at stake, as is authority over quasi-governmental institutions such as the Jewish Agency, which plays a central role in immigration to Israel, and the Jewish National Fund, which owns 13% of Israeli land. Any Jewish adult living in the United States can vote between now and May 4 as long as they accept a set of Zionist principles and pay a $5 registration fee. At the heart of this year’s election is a fierce ideological battle between liberal and right-wing Orthodox factions, each seeking to shape the future of Zionist institutions and their financial priorities at a pivotal time in Israel’s history. The results will impact key issues such as religious pluralism, funding for Jewish education, settlement expansion, and Israel-Diaspora relations. 'This election is about nothing less than the soul of the State of Israel and the Jewish people,' said Rabbi Josh Weinberg, who heads the campaign for the Reform movement’s liberal slate of candidates. 'There are multiple competing visions over what it means to have a Jewish state and essentially to be Jewish. We can help decide some of those things through a democratic process.' These are the 21 slates U.S. Jews can vote for in the 2025 World Zionist Congress election Weinberg’s Vote Reform slate is one of 21 lists vying to capture the 152 seats allocated to American Jewry in the incoming congress, a significant increase over the 15 slates that participated in the last election, five years ago. Whoever wins will serve alongside 173 representatives selected by Jewish communities across the rest of the Diaspora as well as 200 representatives from Israel, who are chosen by Israeli political parties, according to their share of seats in parliament. Representing the largest denomination of American Jewry, the Reform slate won a plurality of American votes last time, but it was the surge of Orthodox lists that defined the 2020 election. The success of Mizrachi, a longstanding slate backed by the institutions of Modern Orthodoxy, and Eretz Hakodesh, a brand new haredi Orthodox list, helped tip the balance at the congress, giving a slight majority for the first time to the right-wing bloc. Campaigning again this time, Eretz Hakodesh hopes to build on its record. 'We invite all who share our values and beliefs to join us and witness the remarkable impact we have made in recent years,' the slate said in a statement after declining an interview request. Many of the nine new slates in this election are running on platforms similar to that of Eretz Hakodesh, whether by espousing Orthodox religious values or pro-settlement politics — or both. One of the factors distinguishing these slates is their demographic focus. Am Yisrael Chai, for example, seeks to represent college students and young professionals. The Israeli American Council slate, which is affiliated with the eponymous advocacy group, caters to Israeli expats, and Beyachad is for Russian-speaking Jews. The left has its own slate of Israeli ex-pats, AID Coalition, which is made up of people who support the Israeli protest movement that’s been challenging the government of Benjamin Netanyahu with massive weekly street demonstrations in recent years. ANU: A New Union, meanwhile, is a new left-wing slate focused on the youth vote. Jews in the United States lean left as a whole, but that’s no guarantee of representation in the congress because only a small fraction of them vote. Of nearly 6 million American Jewish adults, only 125,000 voted in the 2020 election, which was a massive increase over the 56,000 votes cast in 2015. The highest rate of participation ever came in 1987, when about 211,000 voters cast their ballots. Yizhar Hess, vice chairman of the World Zionist Organization, casts the issue of low turnout as a 'shande,' or shame, that threatens the pluralism that Zionism was founded on. He’s hoping he can raise awareness about the election over the next few months by speaking to congregations and other types of gatherings. 'If the congress is called ‘the parliament of the Jewish people’ it should reflect the makeup of world Jewry,' he said. 'That’s why I am investing many hours every day in order to convince the Jews of the diaspora to make their voice heard.'

Knesset debates Israel’s membership in WHO amid accusations of bi...	Son-Har Melech also pointed to the decision of the United States to leave the WHO under the Trump administration, arguing that Israel should take a similar stance. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Knesset Health Committee held a heated discussion on Monday regarding a proposal for Israel to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO), citing claims of systemic anti-Israel bias and discrimination. Coalition lawmakers argued that WHO has repeatedly acted against Israel’s interests, while medical professionals warned that withdrawal could have serious consequences for public health and international cooperation. The discussion was initiated by MK Limor Son-Har Melech (Otzma Yehudit), who accused the WHO of consistently acting with hostility toward Israel. 'The World Health Organization consistently operates with a hostile approach against the State of Israel, while promoting decisions that harm its rights in the international arena,' she stated. 'The organization’s policy is often tainted with anti-Semitism and clear discrimination against Israel and constitutes a serious violation of the legitimacy of the State of Israel as a sovereign state.' Eighty-five percent of Gaza’s hospitals have been used by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad for terror according to the Israel Defense Forces. As reported by The Press Service of Israel in 2023, Hamas made extensive use of the Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical center. Hamas launched rockets from its compound, hid hostages in the bowels of the building, tortured collaborators, and dug tunnels connecting Shifa to nearby sites. Israel also released a recording of a phone call confirming that Hamas also stores at least a half-million liters of fuel underneath the compound. Other Palestinians told Israeli interrogators Hamas deeply embedded itself in the Palestinian Red Crescent Society to use hospitals as a base for attacks. Son-Har Melech also pointed to the decision of the United States to leave the WHO under the Trump administration, arguing that Israel should take a similar stance. 'The President of the United States announced the U.S.’s withdrawal from the organization on the day he entered the White House, with the understanding that the organization does not serve the interests of democratic countries and even harms them. The State of Israel must take a similar step to maintain its international status, prevent harm to its interests, and send a clear message against antisemitic discrimination in any international institution.' President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the World Health Organization on Jan. 21 amid a series of executive orders signed that day. Several other coalition lawmakers, including MKs Galit Distel Atbaryan, Nissim Vaturi, Osher Shekalim, Tsega Malko, Ariel Kellner, Kati Shitrit (Likud), Ohad Tal, and Michal Waldiger (Religious Zionism), expressed support for the proposal, arguing that the WHO has failed to address attacks on Israeli medical personnel and facilities during the October 7 Hamas attack. Prof. Ehud Keinan, an international chemistry expert, also criticized the organization’s credibility, calling its authority 'controversial' and its policies 'corrupt and self-serving.' He cited Taiwan as an example of a country that has thrived in medical and scientific fields despite not being a WHO member. Taiwan is not a member of the World Health Organization (WHO) primarily due to political pressure from China. However, Prof. Dorit Nitzan, a representative of the Israeli Medical Association and a former WHO official, warnead that leaving the organization could significantly harm Israel’s security and public health. 'Withdrawing from the organization could cause significant harm to the country’s ability to cooperate with global health bodies,' she cautioned. 'This includes access to global medical information, early warnings, international research, and medical standards, as well as support during disasters and epidemics.' The discussion also highlighted the WHO’s failure to condemn Hamas’ use of hospitals, particularly Gaza’s Shifa Hospital, for terrorist activities. While the organization condemned an Israeli strike on an Indonesian hospital in Gaza, it has not acknowledged Hamas’ attacks on ambulances or medical personnel. The committee is expected to hold another session to hear from government representatives before reaching a decision. At least 1,180 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 59 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

Smotrich: Israel will not allow Iran to become a nuclear power	U.S. President Donald Trump revealed on Friday that he sent a letter to Khamenei, urging him to negotiate a new nuclear deal with Washington or face possible military action. By Amelie Botbol, Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israel sees 'eye to eye' with the Trump administration on the Iranian threat, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Monday. 'I only say that we are committed to Iran not being a nuclear power,' Smotrich said in response to a question from JNS at a meeting of his Religious Zionism Party’s Knesset faction. 'The American president will decide how to do this,' he added, declining to expand further on the issue. The Islamic Republic has upped its stockpile of near-weapons grade uranium, enough to build six nuclear bombs, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency report seen by Reuters last week. Israeli opposition head Yair Lapid (Yesh Atid Party) told JNS on Monday, 'It is Israel’s goal to make sure that we prevent—in any possible way—Iran from becoming a nuclear power and maintaining and getting a nuclear bomb. … I mean both diplomatically and military efforts. 'We will work with the Americans on this,' he said. 'We are following, of course, the letter President Trump has sent to the supreme leader of Iran, [Ali] Khamenei, and we’ll keep on following it. But Israel is reserving the right to act on its own as well, in order to make sure that Iran does not become a nuclear power… because this will throw the Middle East into a new nuclear race and nobody wins.' U.S. President Donald Trump revealed on Friday that he sent a letter to Khamenei, urging him to negotiate a new nuclear deal with Washington or face possible military action. 'I said: ‘I hope you’re going to negotiate, because it’s going to be a lot better for Iran,'' Trump said in an interview with the Fox Business Network channel. He said he sent the letter on Thursday. Ready to attack Former Defense Minister Benny Gantz, the leader of Israel’s National Unity Party, which now sits in the opposition, emphasized on Monday that Jerusalem must be ready to attack 'if and when needed. 'I think Iran should not be able to possess military nuclear capacity and capabilities,' he reiterated in response to a question from JNS at the weekly faction meeting of his party at the Knesset in Jerusalem. 'I think it’s a war challenge. I think it’s a challenge for the entire region. It’s also a threat to the State of Israel,' Gantz said, noting that while he hopes that Tehran 'won’t go in this direction,' Jerusalem 'should be ready to act.' On Feb. 26, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told Politico that a 'reliable military option' is required to deter the Islamic Republic from taking the final steps toward acquiring nuclear weapons. Time was running out to act against Tehran’s nuclear program, as it had enriched enough uranium for a 'couple of bombs' and was 'playing with ways' to weaponize it, he said. Jerusalem is open to pursuing a diplomatic path, he said, adding that the chances of talks being successful were 'not huge' and that a failure to stop Tehran would be a 'catastrophe for the security of Israel.' Also adding to the urgency of addressing the threat emanating from Tehran, Sa’ar said at the time, was the recent uptick in Iranian arms being smuggled into Judea and Samaria, where Israeli security forces have been conducting a major counter-terrorism operation since Jan. 21. Meanwhile, in a meeting on Monday with Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Sa’ar warned that the Iranians were 'smuggling money to Hezbollah to restore its power. 'Lebanon has an opportunity to break free from Iranian occupation!' he wrote in a social media post after the meeting. Announcing the renewal of Washington’s 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran on Feb. 4, the Trump administration said that 'for far too long—all the way back to 1979, to be exact—nations have tolerated Iran’s destructive and destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and beyond. 'Those days are over. Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world. We will never let that happen,' the White House added in the statement.

Mark Carney to replace Trudeau as Canada’s prime minister	His victory speech took direct aim at U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent trade threats, pledging to maintain retaliatory tariffs 'until the Americans show us respect.' By Jewish Breaking News The Liberal Party of Canada has turned to Mark Carney to replace Justin Trudeau as the country’s prime minister. Carney won on the first ballot on Sunday evening, taking a stunning 85.9% of the vote to beat his nearest rival, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, in a four-person race. Unlike typical Liberal leadership candidates, the 59-year-old enters politics directly at the top, having never held elected office. With Canada facing mounting economic challenges and deteriorating relations with its southern neighbor, Carney brings an impressive financial resume to the table. The former Goldman Sachs investment banker served as governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 before becoming the first foreigner to head the Bank of England, where he guided Britain’s economy through the turbulent Brexit period. Since 2019, he’s worked as UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. His victory speech took direct aim at U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent trade threats, pledging to maintain retaliatory tariffs 'until the Americans show us respect.' 'There’s someone who’s trying to weaken our economy,' Carney declared to a throng of enthusiastic supporters at party headquarters in Ottawa. 'We can control our economic destiny with a plan that puts more money in your pockets, a plan that will ensure your government spends less so Canada can invest more. Because in Canada, we are stronger when we are united.' Carney also drew a sharp contrast between himself and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, claiming his opponent’s approach would leave Canada 'divided and ready to be conquered.' 'Pierre Poilievre would let our planet burn. This is not leadership. It’s ideology. It’s ideology that betrays what we as Canadians value: each other. It’s an ideology that also represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how the economy works,' he said. 'Unlike Pierre Poilievre, I’ve actually worked in the private sector, I know how the world works, and I know how it can be made to work better for all of us.' Carney’s position on Israel represents a notable shift from Trudeau’s increasingly critical stance. While the outgoing prime minister publicly criticized Israel’s defensive operations in Gaza, supported UN resolutions against settlements in Judea and Samaria, and pledged to enforce the ICC’s arrest warrant on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Carney has charted a more moderate course in supporting Israel’s right to self-defense while simultaneously advocating for a two-state solution. The new Liberal leader now faces the daunting task of reversing his party’s polling deficit before a federal election that must occur by October. According to The Globe and Mail, Carney will likely call a snap election sometime before Parliament resumes session in late March. Conservatives under Poilievre maintain a significant lead, though recent polls suggest the gap has narrowed as Liberals have been taking stronger positions on the U.S. trade dispute.

Israeli baby wounded in terrorist rock-throwing near Nablus	Four Israelis were killed in Huwara in 2023—brothers Hallel and Yagel Yaniv in February and father and son Shay Silas and Aviad Nir Nigrekar in August. By JNS A Jewish baby sustained light wounds in a Palestinian rock-throwing attack on the road that bypasses the hostile Samaria village of Huwara, south of Nablus, the Hatzalah Judea and Samaria rescue group said on Monday. The infant was wounded by glass shrapnel, according to the report, which added that the driver continued to drive and sought medical attention for the child at a nearby Israel Defense Forces base. The IDF confirmed the rock-throwing attack, which it said took place in the area of the Arab village of Odala. 'Upon receiving the report, IDF forces rushed to the scene and began a pursuit of the terrorist,' it said. In November, the military started work on a security fence surrounding the road around Huwara, which was opened months earlier as an alternative to the route that passed through the terrorist hotspot. After numerous terrorist attacks against Israelis driving through Huwara, which is located 4.5 miles south of Nablus, Israeli Transport, National Infrastructure and Road Safety Minister Miri Regev inaugurated the main section of the bypass road on Nov. 12, 2023. 'The inauguration of the first and important section of the Huwara Bypass Road is an exciting closing of the circle for me. This life-saving road will provide the pioneers [in Samaria] with greater safety and security,' said Regev at the ceremony. 'The new section will allow residents to travel on the road safely, not through the hostile village where many attacks against Israelis have taken place, including in the recent period,' added the minister. The road seeks to offer Jews traveling to and from central Samaria towns, including Yitzhar, Elon Moreh, Itamar and Har Bracha, a safer route. Four Israelis were killed in Huwara in 2023—brothers Hallel and Yagel Yaniv in February and father and son Shay Silas and Aviad Nir Nigrekar in August. Dual Israeli-U.S. citizen David Stern, 41, narrowly survived a shooting on March 19, 2023, while he was driving through Huwara with his wife on their way to Jerusalem. Six days later, two Israeli soldiers were wounded in a drive-by shooting in the village. Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan had been the main driving force behind the initiative to construct a bypass road and, together with families of terrorism victims, pushed the project for about six years. In 2017, the Israeli government approved an 800 million shekel (around $220 million) plan to construct bypass roads throughout Judea and Samaria, including the Huwara bypass road between the Tapuach and Yitzhar junctions.

Defusing tensions, Trump administration agrees to coordinate Hama...	Netanyahu reportedly reassures Israeli cabinet that the White House has agreed to coordinate special envoy Adam Boehler’s Hamas negotiations with Israel, after a senior Israeli minister blasted the talks. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration has agreed to coordinate its efforts to secure the release of American hostages held in the Gaza Strip with Israel, in an attempt to defuse tensions between Washington and Jerusalem which erupted last week, after it was revealed that an American envoy had secretly initiated direct talks with Hamas. Last week, two anonymous sources revealed to Axios that President Donald Trump’s special envoy for the hostages, Adam Boehler, had opened a direct channel for talks with Hamas, with the goal of securing the release of the five American hostages still held in the Gaza Strip, including one captive believed to still be alive. Israeli officials, who had not been informed of the talks, responded with outrage, privately chastising Boehler over the talks. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, vented to Boehler in a phone call last week, shortly after the U.S. envoy had met in Doha, Qatar with Hamas representative Khalil al-Hayya. On Sunday, however, Netanyahu reassured his cabinet that his government and the Trump administration had reached an understanding on the issue, resolving the diplomatic row. According to a report by Israel’s national broadcaster, Kan, Netanyahu told ministers that the Trump administration had agreed to coordinate its diplomatic efforts vis-à-vis Hamas with Jerusalem. 'The issue has been solved,' Netanyahu was quoted as saying. On Sunday, Boehler addressed the dustup in a string of interviews to U.S. and Israeli media outlets, downplaying the spat and emphasizing that he was negotiating on behalf of the U.S., not Israel.

New Knesset bill would nullify Oslo Accords, restore Israeli cont...	Former Israeli minister drafts bill which would nullify the Oslo Accords and subsequent agreements with the Palestinian Authority, restoring Israeli control to all of Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A former Israeli government minister and his party are pushing legislation that would undo the legal recognition of the Palestinian Authority and restore Israeli control over all of Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. On Sunday, former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir announced that he and the other members of his Otzma Yehudit faction have drafted and submitted to the Knesset a bill which would annul the Oslo Accords, and subsequent deals between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 'Together with my fellow members of the Otzma Yehudit party, I have submitted a bill aimed at canceling the Oslo Accords, the Hebron Agreement, and the Wye Agreement,' Ben-Gvir tweeted. 'According to the proposal, these agreements will be completely annulled, and the State of Israel will restore the previous status, including the return of territories that were transferred as part of these agreements.' 'Additionally, laws enacted to implement these agreements will be repealed, and the Prime Minister will be granted the authority to establish regulations for their implementation.' In September, 1993, then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the first Oslo Accord with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat, laying the foundation for the legal recognition of the PLO in Israel and the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. Two years later, Israel and the PA signed the second Oslo Accord, under which Israel transferred additional territory to the PA and establishing Areas A, B, and C in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. While Israel retained security and civil control over Area C, spanning roughly 60% of Judea and Samaria, the PA was given full control over Area A, and management over civil affairs in Area B. Under the 1995 agreement, Israelis were barred from entering Area A without special dispensation. 'More than three decades after the start of the peace process, it is time to recognize that these agreements have harmed Israel’s security, cost thousands of lives, and led to the strengthening of terrorist organizations in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza,' the bill’s explanatory notes read. 'The establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of Israel would pose an existential threat to the State of Israel and its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and destabilize the region. It would only be a matter of time before Hamas takes control.' 'These agreements have brought thousands of ‘peace victims’ upon the State of Israel, undermined its security and strategic standing, and, above all, paved the way for the establishment of a terrorist state within Israel’s borders.'

Tulsi Gabbard warned about what was happening in Syria	Syrian activists on the ground, such as Coast Youth Forum, believe the death toll could be as high as 1,800, mostly Alawites, but also Christians. By Robert Spencer, Frontpage Magazine During her Senate confirmation hearing, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said this about the situation in Syria at the time: 'I have no love for Assad or any dictator. I just hate al-Qaeda. I hate that our leaders cozy up to Islamist extremists, calling them ‘rebels,’ as Jake Sullivan said to Hillary Clinton, ‘al Qaeda is on our side in Syria.’ Syria is now controlled by al-Qaeda offshoot HTS, led by an Islamist jihadist who danced in the streets on 9/11, and who was responsible for the killing of many American soldiers.' At this point, it is abundantly clear that Gabbard was right, and Sullivan was wrong. Al-Qaeda is not on our side in Syria, and the toppling of the Assad regime has not brought 'democracy' or peace to the country. Instead, as Greek City Times reported Saturday, 'hundreds of Christians, including Greek Orthodox, and Alawites have been killed after clashes broke out on Thursday in the Latakia and Tartous regions on Syria’s Mediterranean coast, according to a human rights monitoring group.' This was likely an understatement of what was really happening: 'The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) said on Friday that more than 225 people have been killed since Thursday. However, this is believed to be a gross underreporting, with activists on the ground, such as Coast Youth Forum, believing the death toll could be as high as 1,800, mostly Alawites, but also Christians.' And so Fox News reported, also on Saturday, that Gabbard’s 'warning of a terrorist takeover in Syria looks to be coming true amid reports that al Qaeda-linked terror forces aligned with Syria’s interim new president—a former al Qaeda terrorist—are being accused of massacring Alawites as well as members of the country’s dwindling Christian community.' An Alawite woman recounted that the jihadis said 'Alawites are pigs, and they have to execute all of them and the small children before the elderly people.' She also 'confirmed reports that the Islamist forces murdered the prominent Alawite 86-year-old cleric Shaaban Mansour and his son Hussein Shaaban.' She added that in the Alawite towns of Nahr al-Bared and Deir Shamil, the jihadis were ' entering houses and killing people and stealing everything. They are covering their faces.' She said: 'I feel there is no safety. There is no homeland. There is nowhere to escape to, and no one to defend us. I feel fear and horrifying feelings.' These are the people whom Barack Obama and Old Joe Biden wanted for years to take power in Syria. Back in April 2022, journalist Aaron Maté wrote that 'Obama officials now back in office under President Biden coordinated with the jihadist franchise in an effort to topple the Syrian regime – while claiming they backed only the ‘moderate opposition.’' Maté added that 'in waging a multi-billion dollar covert war in support of the insurgency against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, top Obama officials who now serve under Biden made it American policy to enable and arm terrorist groups that attracted jihadi fighters from across the globe. This regime change campaign, undertaken one decade after Al Qaeda attacked the U.S. on 9/11, helped a sworn U.S. enemy establish the Idlib safe haven that it still controls today.' In the course of this wrongheaded campaign back in 2012, Jake Sullivan, who was then Director of Policy Planning, wrote to his boss, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 'AQ [Al Qaeda] is on our side in Syria.' I was among the few who were calling attention to this astoundingly foolish policy at the time. On Sept. 17, 2013, I wrote at JihadWatch.org: 'The U.S. is now officially on the side of al-Qaeda.' This was because of Barack Obama’s plan to arm and train 'vetted' members of the Free Syrian Army. In September 2014, said the New York Times, 'Mr. Obama said he envisioned the Free Syrian Army’s providing the ground presence needed to confront ISIS in Syria.' Obama also said: 'We have a Free Syrian Army and a moderate opposition that we have steadily been working with that we have vetted.' But the Free Syrian Army was not vetted, not moderate, and never actually in a position to confront ISIS. Nor did it ever do so. There were numerous reasons why Obama’s plan was unwise from the start. In July 2013, Free Syrian Army fighters entered the Christian village of Oum Sharshouh and began burning down houses and terrorizing the population, forcing 250 Christian families to flee the area. Nor was that an isolated incident. Worthy News reported that just two days after the attack on Oum Sharshouh, Free Syrian Army rebels 'targeted the residents of al-Duwayr/Douar, a Christian village close to the city of Homs and near Syria’s border with Lebanon … Around 350 armed militants forcefully entered the homes of Christian families who were all rounded-up in the main square of the village and then summarily executed.' The New York Times reported in August 2014 that, according to Abu Osama, a member of a Nusra Front brigade that participated in the attack, the Arsal assault was 'a combined operation involving fighters from the Free Syrian Army, the Nusra Front and ISIS.' PJ Media reported the following month that 'multiple media reports indicate that the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) is operating openly with ISIS and other designated terrorist groups.' Now the jihadis are in power in Syria, and they’re behaving in exactly the same way. Will this finally mean the definitive end of the Obama foreign policy strategy of aiding the enemies of our nation? We can only hope.

Rock legend Ozzy Osbourne joins celebrity outrage over BBC bias a...	Much of the outrage has been over the BBC’s Arabic Channel which has been perpetuating a biased narrative against Israel post Oct. 7. By Jewish Breaking News Rock icon Ozzy Osbourne and his wife Sharon have added their names to an open letter accusing the BBC of anti-Israel bias in its Gaza coverage. They’re part of a growing chorus of more than 200 entertainment industry figures demanding accountability from Britain’s national broadcaster. The controversy erupted after the BBC aired last month 'Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone,' a documentary narrated by 14-year-old Abdullah al-Yazouri. What viewers weren’t told was that Abdullah’s father is Hamas’s deputy minister for agriculture. Facing intense backlash, BBC director Tim Davie hastily pulled the documentary and was forced to acknowledge 'serious flaws' in screening processes when questioned by MPs last Thursday. It’s an issue that falls flat for the top talent in the industry, including Jewish actresses Mayim Bialik and Debra Messing, who accuse the BBC of making a mockery of its founding principles of fair reporting established by the UK’s Royal Charter. 'It is time for the BBC to acknowledge that it has a systemic problem of bias against Israel, of which this is the tip of the iceberg,' their letter states. 'This is a true crisis for the broadcaster, which it is treating as a minor inconvenience whilst its highest-paid presenter is allowed to openly deny there is an issue at all.' Much of the outrage has been over the BBC’s Arabic Channel which has been perpetuating a biased narrative against Israel post Oct. 7. BBC Arabic’s Egypt Mean Time program recently hosted Dr. Gamal Salama, an Egyptian commentator who previously praised the Hamas attacks which killed more than 1,200 Israelis as a 'brave and courageous operation.' Meanwhile, the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (Camera) reports that a retired Egyptian army general who described the massacre as a 'month of victory' has been interviewed nine times by BBC News Arabic. Rather than addressing its anti-Israel bias, the BBC retreated behind empty rhetoric about commitment to a 'variety of views.' 'BBC News Arabic is committed to hearing from a range of contributors with a variety of views and perspectives from across Egypt and the wider Middle East. Throughout our coverage, our journalists routinely question and challenge the views of contributors on air, and will continue to do so robustly,' a spokesperson for the BBC said.

Hamas alarmed about emigration of young Gazans	But Hamas will try to force them to stay, even threatening them with death if they 'abandon' the jihadist struggle in order to selfishly improve their private lot. By Hugh Fitzgerald, Frontpage Magazine Much of the world has chosen to dismiss or denounce Trump’s proposal for the Gaza Strip. That plan expresses Trump’s belief that Gaza could be turned into a highly desirable, mostly residential property, with a long and beautiful beachfront, once the rubble is removed, and the unexploded ordnance, and the other explosives with which Hamas booby-trapped so many civilian buildings, could also be collected and safely detonated. No Gazans would be forced to leave; the plan envisions a voluntary and temporary exodus, with Gazans returning, in staggered numbers, once some part of Gaza has again been rebuilt with what Trump envisions as attractive new and solid housing. He believes that this removal of the rubble and then the rebuilding of infrastructure will be paid for by the rich Arab states of the Gulf — Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait — with not one penny coming from the American government. Not all Gazans appear determined to remain in the Strip; some — especially among the young — are eager to leave. These are the people who find Trump’s proposal neither laughable nor offensive, and who hope it can be achieved. Right now, they want out. They want better lives. But Hamas will try to force them to stay, even threatening them with death if they 'abandon' the jihadist struggle in order to selfishly improve their private lot. Now the IDF has found Hamas documents revealing the terror group’s great worry: that the young people in Gaza don’t want to remain where they are; they are sick of being used as human shields, sick of the war begun by Hamas on October 7, sick of being forced to remain among the rubble because of threats from Hamas. They want better lives — can you blame them? — and for now, those lives are not to be found among the rubble and the live explosives of a devastated Gaza. More on Hamas’ alarm over the growing desire of the young to better their lot by leaving Gaza can be found here: 'Foreign barbarians and assimilation: Hamas deeply concerned about Gazans emigrating, doc. reveals,' by Anna Barsky, Jerusalem Post, February 7, 2025: 'Hamas sees the emigration of young Gazans from the Gaza Strip as a great concern since this population forms the nucleus of the terror group’s strength, according to a document seized by the IDF and exposed by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (MAITIC) on Thursday. This comes following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of his plan to relocate residents of the Gaza Strip to neighboring countries earlier this week. According to unofficial data, approximately 250,000 young people have left Gaza since 2007, primarily due to economic conditions. A survey revealed that 44% of young people in Gaza have considered emigrating, mainly for economic reasons.' In Gaza, the unemployment rate has reached a staggering 80%. Like homes, businesses too, lie in ruins. The Gazans’ homes are unlivable — either reduced to rubble, or containing unexploded ordnance — and they do not have the money, or equipment, or know-how, either to clear the land or to rebuild. The young people see no way to a better life as long as they remain in Gaza. Many of them want out. 'The document published by the MAITIC, titled 'Young People Chasing an Illusion,' and written by Hamas’s Khan Yunis Brigade, a brigade within the terror group’s military wing, describes emigration as a serious threat to Hamas’s power…. The document reveals how the terror group attempted to combat this trend through religious and nationalist rhetoric, portraying emigration as a betrayal of Islamic values and the Palestinian struggle….' Hamas is appealing to the young people’s sense of duty as Muslims. They must uphold Islamic values, which means they must remain in Gaza to fight the Infidel Zionists who are occupying Muslim land, no matter how difficult the conditions of their lives become. They should see themselves as warriors for Islam, jihadis, with a religious duty that must outweigh all considerations of private well-being. The young people of Gaza already know that life abroad will not be easy; they know this from the reports sent home by the 250,000 Gazans who have left Gaza ever since Hamas took over in 2007. But they also know that abroad they will be free of the despotic and massively corrupt Hamas rulers — four of whom have stolen a total of $14 billion in aid meant for all the people in Gaza — and will at least have a chance of bettering their economic condition. Those who dislike the religious strictures imposed by Hamas, which is, after all, the Gaza branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, will also be freer to lead the lives they want outside of Gaza. Hamas is worried not that young Muslims leaving Gaza will have a tough time elsewhere, but that they will indeed have better lives. It wants them to remain in Gaza, to serve both as human shields, and as sources of recruits for the terror group. Their individual hopes and dreams be damned; they are soldiers in the army of Allah, and no desertion from that army can be tolerated. Yes, Hamas is worried, for it can just imagine Gazan young men men living abroad, and marrying Infidel (barbarian) women, and even, perhaps, raising those children outside the faith of Islam. And how terrible it would be if those children were deprived of those schoolbooks that teach them to hate Israel and the Jews. It would be far better if those Gazans were to remain at home, to live miserable lives but remaining as warriors for Islam. Amusing, isn’t it, that none of the Hamas leaders live in Gaza, even as they urge other Gazans to remain in the Strip. Both Mousa abu Marzook and Khaled Meshaal have been living in Doha, Qatar, as did the late Ismail Haniyeh. 'The author reinforces his arguments by referencing a Saudi-authored booklet that warns against emigration, which was also seized by the IDF. The booklet, based on Islamic sources, presents emigration as a spiritual and cultural threat, placing the emigrant in a constant state of alienation—torn between the desire for a comfortable life and the duty to preserve religious and cultural identity. The booklet outlines various dangers faced by Muslim emigrants in foreign countries, including exposure to 'tempting' Western culture, the health hazards in the consumption of non-halal food, exposure to diseases, pandemics, and sexually transmitted infections, alongside ongoing psychological stress and uncertainty.' Clearly not just Hamas, but other Arabs are worried about Muslims emigrating to the 'decadent' and alluring West — the booklet discouraging emigration was compiled and disseminated by the Saudis. In a way, I hope they are successful in keeping Arabs and other Muslims at home. For quite other reasons, I want Muslims to be discouraged from emigrating to Western lands, where their presence has proven to have made life for the indigenous non-Muslims much more unpleasant, expensive, and physically dangerous than would be the case without that large-scale Muslim presence. Arab states have criticized Trump’s relocation plan, reaffirming the right of Gaza’s residents to remain in Gaza and their commitment to a two-state solution. Trump made clear that his plan was purely voluntary. No Gazans would be forced to move out of Gaza. But conversely, no Gazans would be forced to remain in Gaza. They would have the freedom to choose. He’s set out an attractive vision of their future, in a rebuilt Gaza, one that would be achieved more swiftly if the Gazans themselves get out of the way both of those conducting the cleanup of rubble and those who then rebuild the housing stock.

Buried in chains: Jerusalem find uncovers radical ascetic practic...	This discovery confirms that ascetic practices, which were once thought to be the domain of male monks, were also embraced by women. By Pesach Benson, TPS The first archaeological evidence in the world for extreme asceticism practiced by nuns was discovered in Jerusalem, providing physical proof of a phenomenon previously known only through historical accounts, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced on Monday. 'The woman was discovered in a single grave, dedicated to her as a sign of honor under the church altar – bema. She was bound with 12-14 rings around the arms or hands, four rings around the neck, and at least 10 rings around the legs. Iron plates or discs on her stomach, which were attached to the rings, gave her skeleton an armored form,' Antiquities Authority researchers Zubair ʼAdawi, Kfir Arbiv, and Dr. Yossi Nagar said. Along with the rings, a small cross was also discovered, indicating her religious devotion. The church and monastery, which operated between the 5th and 7th centuries CE, were home to monks and nuns who practiced extreme forms of asceticism. According to the excavation directors, 'The monks forced destructive acts and self-harm onto the body,' including practices like 'wrapping iron chains and various accessories around the body,' which were believed to elevate the soul. This discovery confirms that ascetic practices, which were once thought to be the domain of male monks, were also embraced by women. 'Ascetic nuns represent a fascinating phenomenon worth dwelling on,' said Dr. Amit Re’em, the Antiquities Authority’s Jerusalem District Archaeologist. 'These literally extraordinary women lived and functioned in a rigid male and patriarchal environment, which inhibited their activities.' While historical records often focus on male ascetics, women like the nun in Jerusalem also adopted these extreme practices. Theodoret of Cyrrhus, a 5th-century Christian writer, mentions two women, Marana and Cyra, who bound themselves with chains for decades. 'The nun is an expression of a phenomenon that was widespread among Byzantine monks in antiquity, which was accompanied by excessive extremism,' said ʼAdawi and Arbiv. The revelation raises new questions about the role of women in the early Christian monastic tradition. Women in Byzantine monastic communities often had to navigate a patriarchal system that excluded them from many religious roles. Some, like the famous Saint Pelagia, disguised themselves as men to be accepted into male-dominated monastic life. Others, like Saint Marina, lived as men to participate in ascetic practices. 'In order to take part in the idealistic religious ideals of the life of nuns and ascetics of that time, which were mostly a male domain, of necessity they had to disguise themselves as men, and live thusly until their death,' Re’em said. The iron rings, although they might seem to suggest torture, were not used as a form of punishment. Historical records indicate that such practices were voluntarily undertaken by monks and nuns as a form of self-flagellation. The belief was that by afflicting the body, the soul could reach higher spiritual levels. The woman’s self-imposed suffering is an example of this extreme asceticism, which was common among Byzantine monks but has now been shown to also include women, the researchers explained. Because of the body’s poor condition, the Antiquities Authority collaborated with the Weizmann Institute of Science to determine its gender. The researchers employed proteomic analysis of tooth enamel, which enabled them to identify unique proteins present in the enamel. These proteins, encoded by X/Y sex chromosomes, confirmed that the skeleton belonged to a woman. According to ‘Adawi and Arbiv, 'The discovery indicates that the extreme asceticism practice, and especially that of wrapping the body with chains, began in northern Syria and Anatolia, expanded to Asia Minor, and reached westward to Europe—to Italy, France, and England. At the same time, the phenomenon expanded southwards and reached Jerusalem and Egypt.'

Israeli security chief rebuffs Netanyahu’s call for his resignati...	Ronen Bar recently mentioned conditions for his resignation, including the release of the rest of the hostages and the establishment of a state commission of inquiry into October 7. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Ronen Bar, chief of Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency, recently rejected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s request for him to resign, Channel 12 reported Sunday evening. On Thursday, 'In a tense meeting between the two, Netanyahu made several harsh statements,' the report said. Referring to the internal Security Service probe regarding its failures on and before the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 invasion of Israel, reporter Yaron Avraham said that Netanyahu 'basically said, ‘We waited for the investigations, now it’s time to put the keys on the table' and leave.' Bar, however, 'made it clear to Netanyahu that if he wanted to fire him, the prime minister would have to do it himself.' Although the Shabak admitted several failures in the report it publicized last week, including serious 'gaps in the recruitment and activation of human resources (HUMINT) in a way that could indicate or warn of an unusual move in the Gaza Strip,' it focused much of the blame on the political echelon. The government allowed Qatar to send millions of dollars in cash that was easily diverted to Hamas’ military arm, it said, and the policy of 'keeping the quiet' in Gaza and 'avoiding offensive initiatives' gave Hamas the opportunity to 'massively strengthen itself.' The report also pointed an accusing finger at 'the cumulative weight of the violations on the Temple Mount, the treatment of prisoners, and the perception that Israeli society has been weakened due to the damage to social cohesion,' saying that 'all of these were catalysts' for Hamas’ decision to go on its offensive, in which the terrorists massacred 1,200 people and took 251 as hostages. Following the report's publication, Channel 12’s Amit Segal cited sources close to the prime minister as saying that 'The conclusions of the Shin Bet investigation do not match the magnitude of the enormous failure and negligence of the organization and its leader.' Bar 'failed completely in everything related to the organization's fight against Hamas in general, and the October 7 incident in particular,' being 'chained to the concept' that Hamas was not interested in a military conflict with Israel, they said, a point of view he repeatedly made clear, the last time being four days before the invasion. Bar also angered Netanyahu last week when he told his top staff that he would only resign after the remaining hostages were released and a state commission of inquiry was established, something that Netanyahu is resisting in its current format because he says it would simply be a political witch hunt. Channel 12 additionally quoted Bar as saying that he would 'use all his power' to prevent an outsider from being appointed his successor, who, he claimed, would subordinate the organization to the political echelon instead of maintaining its independence. 'I will want to pass the baton to one of my two excellent deputies,' he said. In response, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement, 'The government appoints the head of the Shabak, not the current head. This is how it has always been done, as is customary in a democratic country.' The agency then pushed back, stating that 'The Shin Bet chief has never said that he will be the one to appoint his replacement. For decades, it has been accepted that someone who served as deputy head of the service runs for the position of head of the service, in accordance with the Prime Minister's decision.' As a revealing sign of the distrust between the prime minister and Shabak head, Bar, who for most of the war played a major role in the hostage negotiations, has recently been sidelined, with a lower-ranking colleague, M., being sent in his place the last several times talks took place in either Qatar or Egypt.

Israeli activist Danielle Weiss nominated for Nobel Peace Prize	Weiss currently leads Nahala, a movement advocating for the re-establishment of Jewish communities in Gaza. By Pesach Benson, TPS Danielle Weiss, a key Israeli activist in Judea and Samaria, has been nominated for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. Professors Amos Azaria of Ariel University and Shalom Sadik of Ben-Gurion University submitted her candidacy, citing her decades-long efforts in strengthening Jewish communities and promoting regional stability. The establishment of Jewish communities has prevented violence and enhanced security, they argued in a letter to the Nobel Prize Committee in Norway. 'While there is a significant Jewish presence in Judea and Samaria, in Gaza – where the Jews were displaced in the 2005 disengagement – thousands of Jewish deaths and tens of thousands of Arab deaths were recorded. In Judea and Samaria, on the other hand, the figures are significantly lower, illustrating how the settlement, led by Weiss, was a factor in settlement that in practice prevented friction and large-scale wars,' Azaria and Sadik wrote. Weiss, now 79, was a long-time active member of Gush Emunim, a religious-political movement founded in 1974 following the Yom Kippur War. She later served as the first mayor of Kedumim in northern Samaria from 1996-2007. 'Weiss’s activities strengthened security and stability, and as a result, contributed to reducing bloodshed in the region,' the letter added. She currently leads Nahala, a movement advocating for the re-establishment of Jewish communities in Gaza. According to the Nobel Prize website, 244 individuals and 94 organizations have been nominated for the annual Peace Prize. The names of the winners will be announced in October. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1978 for bringing about the Camp David Accords. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and then-Foreign Minister Shimon Peres shared the prize with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat in 1994 for the Oslo Accords. Since then, there have been multiple attempts to rescind Arafat’s prize over his continued support for terror. The Nobel Prize Committee has rejected the requests, saying there is no precedent for revoking the prize. The Nobel Prize also honors achievements in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, and Economic Sciences. The awards are given out on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death in 1896.

IDF appoints Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin as new spokesman	The previous IDF spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, served as the IDF’s chief spokesman since March 29, 2023. By JNS IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir has appointed Brig. Gen. Ephraim 'Effie' Defrin as the new commander of the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit. The appointment was approved by Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz. Defrin was seriously wounded while serving as a tank battalion commander in the 2006 Second Lebanon War, and has served as Israel’s defense attache to India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. In his most recent position, he served as the head of the military’s International Cooperation Division. He will replace the current IDF Spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, in the near future. Hagari served as the IDF’s chief spokesman since March 29, 2023. Hagari, 48, has served in the IDF since 1995. He led the Shayetet 13 (Flotilla 13) naval commando unit from 2019 to 2021. Zamir thanked Hagari for his service In June, Hagari was widely criticized after he told the Channel 13 News broadcaster that the government’s goal of ending Hamas rule in Gaza can only truly be accomplished by putting in place a viable alternative. Hagari stated that 'Hamas is an idea,' and that as such, 'anyone who thinks it can be eliminated is wrong.' He also said the Iranian-backed terrorist organization is 'rooted in the hearts of the people' of Gaza. In December, Defense Minister Katz threatened disciplinary action against Hagari after he expressed in-uniform criticism of the 'Feldstein Law,' a bill making its way through the Knesset that would give immunity to members of the security establishment who give classified files to the prime minister or the defense minister. Hagari’s subsequent apology 'put an end to the incident,' leading Katz to abandon his plans to initiate disciplinary proceedings, sources close to the defense minister stated, adding that Katz would not tolerate any further partisan political statements from 'anyone wearing a uniform.' Also last year, Hagari demanded that Channel 14 News take down an 'inciting' meme that mocked IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, calling it 'humiliation of the IDF and its commanders in wartime.' In a public response, the broadcaster called on Halevi to 'clarify to Rear Admiral Hagari that he is a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces and not a television critic.' The channel also said it 'did not broadcast any inciting video against the IDF or against any of its commanders.' The post IDF appoints Brig. Gen.

Hezbollah leader vows to block Israeli presence in Southern Leban...	It was Qassem’s first interview since taking leadership of the terror group in late October following the assassination by Israel of his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah. By JNS Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem declared on Sunday that the Iranian terror proxy will not tolerate any Israeli military presence in Southern Lebanon. In a televised interview with Hezbollah-affiliated al-Manar TV, Qassem accused the Jewish state of multiple ceasefire violations, warning that the truce would not hold. 'I say to the Israelis—if you stay in these positions, how long do you think it will last? The resistance will not allow you to remain there,' he said. 'If the occupation persists, the army, the people and the resistance will confront it. We have no ties to any agreement between the U.S. and Israel.' The IDF confirmed last month that its forces would remain in five outposts in Southern Lebanon beyond the ceasefire deadline of Feb. 18. Israel’s decision to keep boots on the ground in Lebanon was made in conjunction with the Trump administration. It was Qassem’s first interview since taking leadership of the terror group in late October following the assassination by Israel of his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah.

The Nov. 27, 2024, ceasefire ended over a year of clashes, including a two-month war involving Israeli ground forces. The agreement stipulated a full Israeli withdrawal within 60 days, but Israeli troops remain in five key border positions, citing security concerns.

Israel pressuring Egypt to take in Gazans – report	Senior Israeli minister met with Egyptian official in Jerusalem last month, according to report, lobbying for Cairo to drop its objections to mass migration of Gazans, claiming Egyptian people support the move. By World Israel News Staff Israel's government is lobbying Egypt to take in residents of the Gaza Strip en masse, urging Cairo to drop its long-standing opposition to providing refuge for large numbers of Gazans, according to a report Sunday night. Two officials, one Israeli, told The Times of Israel on condition of anonymity that Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, host a senior Egyptian official in Jerusalem last month. The report described the meeting as 'tense,' noting that the two leaders aired their disagreements over President Donald Trump's Gaza resettlement plan. Since taking office on January 20th, Trump has pressured both Cairo and Amman to agree to take in Gazans on a permanent basis, hinting the U.S. could withhold aid money should the two refuse. Aid to Jordan has already reportedly been frozen, as part of the State Department's across-the-board halt to nearly all foreign aid during an assessment period - while aid to Egypt and Israel has remain untouched. During the meeting, the Egyptian official voiced his government's opposition to the plan, reiterating Cairo's position that the mass migration of any significant portion of Gaza's population of roughly two million into Egypt - home to 115 million people - represents an existential threat to the country. Dermer reportedly pressed the Egyptian official, urging Cairo to drop its opposition to the Trump plan, claiming that the Egyptian people do not share their government's opposition to taking in Gazans. Cairo expressed alarm at Dermer's position and has sought to arrange further meetings between him and senior Egyptian officials to clearly convey the country's firm rejection of the Trump proposal, the Times said. A follow-up meeting has been planned but the date not yet finalized.

Hamas pushing for 10-year ceasefire – report	Talks between Hamas and Trump envoy include proposal by the Gaza terror group for a 10-year truce with Israel in not only Gaza but Judea & Samaria as well. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization is pushing for a comprehensive deal with the United States, including an agreement which would secure a ten-year truce with Israel, according to an Arabic report Monday. The London-based, Qatari owned media outlet The New Arab reported that Hamas negotiators have rejected a proposal by President Donald Trump's special envoy on hostages, Adam Boehler, for a limited agreement to secure the release of American captives held in the Gaza Strip. In response, The New Arab reported, the Gaza terror group made a counteroffer, calling for a sweeping deal which would include the U.S. brokering an agreement with Israel for a decade-long ceasefire in not only the Gaza Strip, but also in Judea and Samaria. Hamas demanded that Israel also commit to maintaining the status quo in Jerusalem - likely referring to the Temple Mount and limits placed on non-Muslim visitation. In exchange, Hamas 'expressed its readiness for the possibility of talking about' some form of disarmament and the release of all of the 59 remaining hostages - beginning with American nationals. Five American citizens remain in the Gaza Strip, though only one, Eden Alexander, is believed to be alive. The four others, Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai, and Judith Weinstein are believed to have been killed either on October 7th or during their captivity in Gaza. However, Hamas officials emphasized that the group would never completely disarm, even if a Palestinian state were to be established, suggesting that only the group's rocket and missile arsenal would be on the table. The terror group also reiterated its refusal to ever directly negotiate with Israel.

Trump ‘wasting time’ by negotiating with Hamas, says ex-ambassado...	David Friedman, an attorney for Donald Trump who served as the president's envoy to Israel during his first term, makes a rare public criticism of the Trump over his decision to hold direct talks with Hamas. By World Israel News Staff A former U.S. ambassador to Israel and Trump loyalist voiced a rare public criticism of the Trump administration over the weekend, chiding the White House's decision to engage in direct talks with the Hamas terror organization in a bid to return American hostages held by the Gaza group. On Sunday, former Ambassador David Friedman, who represented the first Trump administration in Israel and in the past had served as an attorney for Donald Trump, penned a tweet responding to comments by Adam Boehler, a businessman tapped to serve as Trump's special envoy for hostage affairs. Boehler spoke to multiple media outlets in the United States and Israel on Sunday, following a dustup with senior Israeli officials following revelations that Boehler had reached out to Hamas to initiate negotiations for the return of American hostages held in Gaza. Downplaying the rift with Israel, which was reportedly kept in the dark on the talks, Boehler claimed in an interview with CNN Sunday that Hamas is prepared to disarm. Hours later, however, Friedman took aim at Boehler's talks with Hamas, calling the effort a 'waste of time.' 'This past week, President Trump brilliantly presented Hamas with a binary choice: release all the hostages and surrender, or be destroyed. It is the only path to ending the war,' Friedman wrote. 'If I heard Adam Boehler correctly on the Sunday news shows, he took the unprecedented step to meet with Hamas to consider a third way — whether a deal could be struck where Hamas 'would not be involved' in governing Gaza.' 'A deal with Hamas is a waste of time and will never be kept. Attempting one is beneath the dignity of the United States. Adam, I know you mean well but listen to your boss. The choice must remain binary.'

Kiryat Shmona mayor slams ‘premature’ reopening of schools	Mayor of northern city says schools reopened too early; Only 50 percent of students said to have returned to Kiryat Shmona. By World Israel News Staff Schools in Kiryat Shmona, Israel's northernmost city near the border with Lebanon, reopened for the first time after some 16 months of war on Sunday. But what should have been a celebratory milestone was met with little fanfare, and even opposition from the municipality's mayor. Mayor Avichai Stern has long criticized the Education Ministry for what he says has been intense pressure to reopen schools in the northern city, which was severely battered by more than a year of near-daily bombardment by Hezbollah drones, missiles, and rockets. As Education Minister Yoav Kisch posed for pictures at a ribbon-cutting ceremony marking the reopening of a school in the city, Stern released a media statement claiming that the minister had not provided practical support to the municipality and had come strictly for the photo opportunity. Stern stressed that Kisch had 'invited himself' and that his visit was not coordinated with the municpality, and even accused the minister of 'hindering' the city in its efforts to open schools at a later date. According to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Walla, only about 50 percent of Kiryat Shmona's elementary through high school age students had returned to the city. Stern recently published a video showing what appeared to be major security failures along the Lebanese border near the city, urging northerners not to return home until their physical safety is secured. Golan Buchris, the head of a local parent advocacy group, told Walla that the reopening had been premature and hastily executed. 'Dozens if not hundreds of students were left without support,' he said. 'We suggested waiting [to reopen schools] until July. The students' mental state is worrying.' Buchris said that after being uprooted from their homes and returning to a city visibly damaged by war, the education system has not provided 'psychologists or emotional therapists who can help them' readjust. Kiryat Shmona was evacuated shortly after the October 7th Hamas terror onslaught. The city's community centers, after-school programs, and other extracurricular and cultural activities remain closed.

We are not an agent of Israel’: Trump hostage envoy’s remarks sh...	Boehler: 'We’re the United States. We’re not an agent of Israel. We have specific interests at play.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Senior Israeli officials expressed shock at the remarks made by Trump's hostage envoy during a CNN interview in which he insisted that the U.S. was 'not an agent of Israel.' The discussion centered on the controversy surrounding envoy Adam Boehler’s direct talks with Hamas to secure the release of more captives. Following Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer’s criticism of the policy of direct talks with the terror group, Boehler appeared on CNN to defend the decision, stating, 'I understand the consternation and the concern. I wasn’t upset.' He added, 'At the same time, we’re the United States. We’re not an agent of Israel. We have specific interests at play.' During a phone call last week, Dermer expressed his dissatisfaction with Boehler’s meeting with a senior Hamas delegation, led by Khalil al-Hayya, in Doha. Dermer was upset that Boehler discussed the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for one living U.S. citizen and the remains of four deceased American hostages. Boehler argued that these were only initial talks and emphasized that no agreements would be made without Israel’s approval. On Wednesday, media outlets reported that U.S. officials were taking the unprecedented step of negotiating directly with Hamas, overturning established U.S. policy of avoiding talks with terror groups. Jerusalem is displeased with these direct negotiations, particularly because Israeli officials were informed of the talks only after they occurred, contrary to U.S. officials' claims that Israel had been fully briefed. The U.S. chose not to inform Israel of the meeting between Trump hostage envoy Adam Boehler and Hamas ahead of time because a similar meeting had previously been canceled due to opposition from Israel. Boehler proceeded with the meeting, focusing on the need to secure the release of American hostage Eden Alexander and the remains of four deceased U.S. citizens: Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai, and Judith Weinstein. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposed the idea of direct talks between the U.S. and Hamas when proposed by the Trump Administration last month. According to Ynet, Israel was behind the leak of the direct negotiations between the U.S. and Hamas in an attempt to derail them.

Hamas makes outrageous demands for releasing remaining hostages	In the first phase of the current hostage deal, nearly half of all Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails were released. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Amid news of extended negotiations with Hamas regarding phase two of the hostage agreement, the terror group is reportedly demanding the release of numerous Palestinian prisoners, a full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza, and a commitment from Israel not to resume fighting. In exchange for the remaining hostages, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian terrorists, including all remaining mass murderers, and the IDF would be obligated to fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip—an issue that has caused serious impasses in previous hostage agreements. In the first phase of the current hostage deal, nearly half of all Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails were released. As part of the hostage release and ceasefire agreement, 274 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences have been freed, with 300 still remaining in Israeli jails, according to Kan News. Israel is currently holding 9,406 individuals classified as terrorists and security detainees. Of these, 1,486 are serving prison sentences, 2,960 are undergoing criminal proceedings but have not yet been convicted, and 3,405 are held as administrative detainees. Last May, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza, calling it a 'victory for Hamas.' 'Throughout the negotiations, Israel has shown a willingness to make significant concessions,' Netanyahu said in May 2024. 'But while Israel has shown this willingness, Hamas has maintained its extreme positions, first and foremost the withdrawal of our forces from the Strip, the conclusion of the war, and leaving Hamas intact.' Ending the war without dismantling Hamas would constitute a 'great victory for Hamas,' Netanyahu continued. The Prime Minister's office announced on Saturday night that Israel has agreed to resume talks in Doha, Qatar, in an effort to revive the stalled ceasefire agreement with the Hamas terrorist organization. According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Israel has accepted an invitation to participate in talks supported by the U.S. and will send a delegation to Doha on Monday to 'advance the negotiations.'

Israel’s Defense Minister Katz calls new Syrian president an ‘al-...	Katz: 'Israel will take all necessary steps to defend itself from any threat originating from Syria.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's Defense Minister, Katz, harshly criticized Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, following the execution of at least 90 Alawites loyal to former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Using the alias of Syria's current president, Katz took to X to condemn the killings, stating, 'Al-Julani exchanged his robe for a suit, presenting himself as moderate. But now, he has removed the mask, revealing his true identity: A jihadist terrorist aligned with al-Qaeda, responsible for horrific acts against innocent civilians.' 'Israel will take all necessary steps to defend itself from any threat originating from Syria,' he added. Katz vowed that Israel would maintain a military presence in the buffer zone along the border. 'We will remain in the security zones and on Mount Hermon, protecting the communities of the Golan and Galilee. We will ensure that southern Syria remains demilitarized and free of threats, and we will protect the local Druze population – anyone who harms them will face our response,' Katz said. In the past several days, Syrian government forces crushed a rebellion within Assad’s Alawite sect. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that more than 185 people had been killed, with 90 of them Alawites, a sect of Assad loyalists, who were executed by the regime. The Britain-based group reported, 'Ninety Alawite civilians, including at least six women, were executed by security forces in Baniyas, Latakia, and Jableh.' An Alawite source told Ynet that Syrian regime forces were looting homes, perpetrating violence, and arresting young people. The source called on Israel to come to the aid of the Alawites, saying, 'The Alawites are asking for Netanyahu's immediate intervention.' Israel is focused on protecting the Druze community in Syria and in border communities within Israel. Last week, the Israeli government ordered the IDF to intervene militarily against Syria's new regime and to defend Syrian Druze living outside of Damascus, the capital city.

Rabbi sues ‘Jews for Jesus’ over using image in promotion materia...	Amitay claims the post created a false association between him and the organization, which subsequently resulted in his firing and severely damaged his reputation with the Orthodox community. By Jewish Breaking News An aspiring rabbi is suing for defamation after discovering his likeness was used without consent by a messianic Christian organization. The controversy began when Jews for Jesus posted a picture on social media following the October 7 Hamas massacre of an IDF soldier’s face to highlight their recruiting efforts in the Jewish State. According to the lawsuit, the soldier in the photo is Ariel Amitay, an Orthodox Jewish teacher from Israel. Amitay claims the post created a false association between him and the organization, which subsequently resulted in his firing and severely damaged his reputation with the Orthodox community. Liberty Counsel, representing Jews for Jesus, rejected the allegations, explaining that the group properly purchased the stock image, deliberately obscured facial features, and never mentioned any individual by name in their promotional materials. 'The question is whether they said anything about this individual at all, and they took steps to blur his face and then didn’t say that this particular individual is a member of our group or affiliated with us in any way, shape or form,' Liberty Counsel’s Daniel J. Schmid told reporters on Friday. 'They used it in a social media post saying, hey, here’s what we have done after the atrocities of October 7, to support those who might desire comfort and peace during a turbulent time, and they didn’t say anything about this particular individual.' Schmid believes the case being heard at the Superior Court of San Francisco County will be dismissed on these grounds alone. 'I think we stand on very firm First Amendment grounds and other defenses that we will raise, and I think this suit is meritless, it’s destined for dismissal, as it should be.'

Israeli police officer finds son dead at bus crash scene	Three male victims with moderate injuries — ages 16, 29 and 43 were moderately injured — and another nine victims with light injuries were all taken to Beer-Sheva’s Soroka Medical Center for treatment. By Pesach Benson, TPS A 22-year-old Israeli killed in a Sunday morning bus crash near Beer-Sheva is the son of a senior police officer who responded to the accident. Liron Avitan was killed and 12 others injured when their bus overturned near Kiryat Gat. Liron’s father, Deputy Commissioner Yosef Avitan, is the commander of the Southern Traffic Police Department. On arriving at the scene, Yosef discovered that his son was declared dead by Magen David Adom responders. 'The bus was upside down on its left side and a man was trapped underneath it, unconscious, with no signs of life and very serious injuries to his body,' said Paramedic Ronen Shunam Halevi, Medic Naftali Halberstadt and senior MDA medic Aviran Goshen. 'We performed medical examinations, but unfortunately his injuries were significant and we had to declare him dead on the spot.' Three male victims with moderate injuries — ages 16, 29 and 43 were moderately injured — and another nine victims with light injuries were all taken to Beer-Sheva’s Soroka Medical Center for treatment.

Israel to ‘soon’ allow Syrian Druze to work in Golan, Defense Min...	An estimated 700,000-800,000 Druze live in Syria, mostly in southwestern areas near Israel and Jordan. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel is preparing to 'soon' allow Syrian Druze to work in the Golan Heights, Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Sunday. 'We will soon allow Druze workers from Syria to work in the Golan Heights communities in Israel,' Katz said. 'As Defense Minister, I salute them for their loyalty and heroism and their contribution to Israel’s security in difficult and crucial times – we will continue to strengthen them and also protect their brothers in Syria against any threat.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the demilitarization of southern Syria and protection for its Druze community on Feb. 23. An estimated 700,000-800,000 Druze live in Syria, mostly in southwestern areas near Israel and Jordan. They make up around four percent of the Syrian population. Analysts and Israeli Druze recently told TPS-IL that Netanyahu’s remarks were a major shift in Israeli policy. The Press Service of Israel’s conversations with Druze residents of the Syrian town of Sweida revealed optimism about Netanyahu’s pledge, as well as internal divisions. The Israeli government announced on Monday it was planning to adopt an unprecedented five-year 3.9 billion NIS ($1.08 billion) development plan for the Druze and Circassian communities to boost local economies, housing, and local planning. Israel’s Druze community of 152,000 trace their ancestry back to the Biblical figure Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses. Israeli Druze serve in senior positions in public and military life, and the bond between Jewish and Druze soldiers is referred to as the 'covenant of blood.' The Druze speak Arabic but are not Muslim and are very secretive about their religious beliefs. The Druze living in the Galilee and Mount Carmel areas sided with the Jews in 1948 during Israel’s War of Independence, opted to be part of Israeli society and established themselves in all areas of public life. When Israel captured the Golan Heights during the Six-Day War of 1967, the Golan Druze refused Israeli offers of citizenship, believing Syria would recapture the plateau. But attitudes have changed since the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2011.

Israel to halt supply of electricity to Gaza	Last Sunday, the Israeli government announced the suspension of all humanitarian aid to Gaza after Hamas rejected the ceasefire extension proposed by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. By JNS Israel will stop supplying electricity to the Gaza Strip, Energy and Infrastructure Minister Eli Cohen said on Sunday. 'I have signed an order immediately cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip. Enough talk, it’s time for action!'' Cohen wrote in a post to X. חתמתי כעת על צו להפסקת החשמל לרצועת עזה באופן מיידי. מספיק עם דיבורים, הגיע הזמן למעשים! pic.twitter.com/dV2wrMrnHI &mdash; אלי כהן | Eli Cohen (@elicoh1) March 9, 2025 Last Sunday, the Israeli government announced the suspension of all humanitarian aid to Gaza after Hamas rejected the ceasefire extension proposed by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that no goods or supplies would enter Gaza until further notice. Since the ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19, more than 25,000 aid trucks carrying food, water and medicine have entered Gaza, alongside more than half a million tents and 2,100 fuel tankers. Israeli officials estimate that Hamas has stockpiled supplies sufficient for four to six months. 'There is no shortage of essential products in the Strip whatsoever,' said Israel’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, in response to a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the E3—France, Germany and the United Kingdom. 'We call on the Government of Israel to abide by its international obligations to ensure full, rapid, safe and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance to the population in Gaza,' the E3 said on March 5. The Foreign Ministry had quoted former U.S. President Joe Biden, who said on Oct. 18, 2023, that if Hamas 'diverts or steals' the aid, then 'it will stop the international community from being able to provide' it. 'Aid that goes to Hamas is not humanitarian. Enabling the enemy to resupply itself so it can regroup and attack you again is not humanitarian—it is suicidal and will not be allowed,' the Foreign Ministry said. Stolen humanitarian aid became the economic lifeline for Hamas during the current war, handing it profits estimated at a half-billion dollars, according to Channel 12. Netanyahu addressed the issue of Hamas exploiting aid at a Sept. 4 press conference, promising that Israel would in time strip the terrorist group of its ability to use the stolen supplies for financial gain. David Mencer, spokesman for the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem, told press on March 3: 'It is Hamas who is harming the Gazan population. Hamas systematically takes the humanitarian aid and sells it to support their own terror. … Hamas could be humanitarian but they’ve in fact been barbarian.' With Witkoff slated to travel to Doha on Tuesday to encourage negotiations between Israel and Hamas, the Jewish state confirmed that it will participate in the discussions. 'Israel has accepted the invitation of the mediators backed by the United States,' the Prime Minister’s Office stated, in a translation of the Hebrew, 'and will send a delegation to Doha on Monday in an effort to advance the negotiations.'

Israel threatens Gaza siege, targeted killings, and invasion to f...	Report details Israel's plans to force Hamas into resuming release of hostages - including restoring the full siege on Gaza, targeted killings of Hamas leaders, mass evacuations in Gaza, and a full-scale invasion. By World Israel News Staff Israel's cabinet has prepared a list of measures to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages held in the Gaza Strip, with progressively more intense steps taken should the Gaza terror group refuse to comply. Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Israeli government has draft a plan to force Hamas to resume its release of hostages, with a list of incremental moves to pressure Hamas before returning to a full-blown ground war in Gaza. The first step, halting the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip, has already been implemented, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Israeli border crossings to bar passage to trucks entering Gaza last Sunday. Now, according to the report, Israel is poised to restore the full siege on Gaza put in place in the early days of the war, shortly after October 7th, 2023. This would include a complete halt to the supply of electricity and water from Israel to Gaza. According to the Journal report, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) said the Israeli already discussed both measures last week. Should Hamas continue its refusal to release hostages, Israel would then launch a campaign of targeted assassinations against Hamas leaders and airstrikes targeting Hamas positions across Gaza - but without a return to the ground campaign. After that, Israel is expected to order mass evacuations of Gazans, clearing out the northern Gaza Strip, as the IDF did early in the war. Then, should all else fail, the IDF will resume its full-scale ground operation in the Gaza Strip; likely on a larger scale than before the ceasefire, with the goal of directly controlling large swaths of the Gaza Strip.

Israel working to facilitate mass migration from Gaza under Trump...	If 5,000 emigrate per day it'll take one year to empty Gaza' - Israeli lawmakers say host countries sought to receive Gaza's population as Israel works to establish 'Migration Authority.' By World Israel News Staff The Israeli government is actively working to implement President Donald Trump's resettlement plan for the entire population of the Gaza Strip, Coalition lawmakers revealed Sunday. On Sunday afternoon, the Knesset's Land of Israel Caucus held a conference to discuss Trump's plan to relocate the roughly two million Palestinian Arabs living in the Gaza Strip. During the conference, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party), a long-time advocate for population transfer, told the conference that efforts are underway not only to establish a government authority to help Gazans emigrate, but also to find third-party countries to take Gazans in. 'For the enormous sacrifices and determination of an entire nation not to let this [war] turn into just another round of fighting, we must embrace this plan wholeheartedly,' Smotrich said. 'We are establishing a Migration Authority.' 'Work is being done with the [Trump] administration to locate potential host countries and to prepare the establishment of a large Migration Authority within the Ministry of Defense.' 'If we relocate 5,000 people per day, it will take a year. The logistics are complex because we need to determine who is going to which country. We are preparing for this under the leadership of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense. Budget constraints will not be an obstacle—this is not just another initiative; it has the potential to be a historic turning point.' Minister of Settlements and National Missions MK Orit Strook (Religious Zionist Party) said implementation of Trump's Gaza plan is essential to Israel's long-term security. 'There is no way to achieve the war objectives we set as a government—to eliminate all threats from Gaza to Israel—except through the only viable path: a voluntary migration plan.' 'Even if we defeat Hamas as a civilian and military regime, as long as we do not allow the majority of the population to migrate, we will not remove the threat. They know nothing else but to think about destroying us. This is where we are headed—I say this as a government member and a cabinet member: the government will take responsibility.' Last month, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) announced that he had instructed the IDF to prepare to help facilitate the mass migration of Gazans out of the Gaza Strip, including organizing transit through Israeli ports and air travel hubs.

Former hostage Eli Sharabi visits Downing Street, meets UK Prime ...	Sharabi’s family had previously visited Downing Street twice before—each time pledging to return with Eli. On Friday, that moment became a reality. By Jewish Breaking News As Eli Sharabi continues his global efforts to raise awareness, his message remains clear: 'We are not free until all the hostages are free.' On Friday, the former hostage visited 10 Downing Street for an emotional meeting with British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, just weeks after his release from captivity. Sharabi, whose harrowing testimony on Channel 12’s Uvda gained international attention, was part of a delegation of freed hostages who met with U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this week at the White House. A Painful Reunion and a Call for Action During the meeting, the Prime Minister expressed his deepest sympathies for the tragic loss of Eli’s British-Israeli wife, Lianne, their teenage daughters, Noiya and Yahel, and his brother Yossi, who was murdered in captivity. Starmer listened as Sharabi described the inhumane conditions he endured during his nearly 500 days as a Hamas hostage, including beatings and starvation. Despite his suffering, Sharabi emphasized: 'I never lost hope of coming home.' Sharabi also urged the UK government to take further action to secure the release of the 59 remaining hostages, including his brother Yossi’s body. The Prime Minister assured him that securing their freedom remained a top priority. 'Inhuman is a word that is used too often,' Starmer said, 'but your experience warranted that word.' He promised: 'The British government will do everything we can. We will redouble our efforts.' A Symbolic Gift and Continued Advocacy Sharabi presented Starmer with a framed copy of The Times’ Peter Brooks cartoon, which depicted him, Or Levy, and Ohad Ben Ami appearing emaciated upon their release—juxtaposed with Holocaust survivors under the caption: 'Never Again – Again.' Earlier this week, Sharabi had also gifted the same print to President Trump during their meeting in the Oval Office. The meeting at Downing Street was attended by Sharabi’s brother, Sharon, his brother-in-law, Stephen Brisley, family friend Annabel Sheldon, and the family’s lawyers, Adam Rose and Adam Wagner. A Return to Downing Street Under Different Circumstances Sharabi’s family had previously visited Downing Street twice before—each time pledging to return with Eli. On Friday, that moment became a reality. Now free, Sharabi remains committed to advocating for the hostages who remain in captivity, including those with British ties—Avinatan Or, Shay Levinson, and his brother Yossi Sharabi. A Survivor’s Journey Eli Sharabi, 52, was abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri during the Hamas terror attack on October 7, 2023. His wife and daughters were murdered while hiding in their safe room, and his brother Yossi was taken captive before being killed in Gaza. Upon Sharabi’s release on February 8, images of his frail condition shocked the world. At the time, Prime Minister Starmer expressed relief at his release but condemned the appalling circumstances in which he had been held. On Friday, a Downing Street spokesperson reaffirmed the UK government’s commitment to securing the freedom of the remaining hostages, stating that the ongoing suffering of those still in captivity is a brutal reminder of Hamas’ inhumanity.

An ex-jihadist working for the government is smearing Trump	The answer lies in an old USAID-funded program that was supposed to train Jihadis in Afghanistan to become reporters. Instead it embedded the Jihadis into the media. By Daniel Greenfield, Frontpage Magazine In 2017, the Voice of America attacked President Trump’s travel ban on Muslim terrorist countries. What the VOA did not tell viewers was that its ‘reporter’ was a former Jihadist. In the 1980s, Masood Farivar, an Afghan Muslim, now a senior analyst at the government’s Voice of America media organization, had joined Jihadist groups in Afghanistan whose members included Taliban leaders and who had worked with Al Qaeda. Farivar’s Jihadi comrades included Awal Gul: the Taliban commander locked up in Gitmo after being paid $100,000 by Bin Laden to help him escape. Farivar has since mourned Awal Gul wondering 'how many other Awalguls languish in Gitmo.' But over the last eight years, Farivar had a new enemy, cranking out dozens of articles for the VOA with titles like, 'Can Trump Be Indicted for Obstruction of Justice?', 'Has Trump Done Enough to Fence Off His Business Interests?' and 'Hush Money Troubles for Trump?' The only thing more troubling than the VOA, which operates under the U.S. government, waging a sustained campaign against the president was the man whose name appeared on its articles. In his memoir, ‘Confessions of a Mullah Warrior’, Farivar described being inspired by Yunus Khalis, Osama bin Laden’s mentor, known as the Al Qaeda leader’s ‘Father Sheikh’, who welcomed him to Afghanistan, and whose Hezb-i Islami Khalis would fight alongside Al Qaeda against American forces in Afghanistan after the Muslim terrorist attacks of September 11. The Voice of America senior analyst described the Al Qaeda ally as 'deeply pious' with a 'wry sense of humor' to whom 'Jihad was a means to liberate Afghanistan' whose 'message while simple and straightforward reasoned with me deeply.' Before long, Farivar was fighting for the Jihadist group in Afghanistan alongside 'Arab volunteers' shouting 'Allahu Akbar'. How did a former Jihadist go from the battlefields of Afghanistan to Washington D.C. and a bedroom community in Fairfax County filled with mosques and government employees, and from admiring Osama bin Laden’s mentor to working for a government media agency? The answer lies in an old USAID-funded program that was supposed to train Jihadis in Afghanistan to become reporters. Instead it embedded the Jihadis into the media. Masood Farivar was one of a number of ex-Jihadis who went to work for the global media. Farivar’s presence at VOA is part of the larger story of another USAID project backfiring badly. Rather than propagandizing in Afghanistan, Jihadi reporters spread propaganda in America.. When a Muslim terrorist drove a truck into a French crowd on Bastille Day, killing 86 and wounding over 400, Farivar responded with an article titled, ‘Learn to Live With Terrorism’ Strikes Some as Good Advice'. When Front Page Magazine covered the Hamas Oct 7 attacks, he wrote an article smearing us as an 'anti-Muslim' hate group for telling the truth about Jihad. In VOA articles, he contended that demographic replacement by Muslims was a 'right-wing conspiracy theory' and that racists were responsible for most domestic terrorism. A VOA segment credited to Farivar included the claim that, 'the level of involvement in violent extremism by Muslims in the United States is still quite low', Last year, Farivar wrote a VOA analysis headlined, 'The Hidden Cost Of Being Branded A Terrorist By The US Government' echoing claims from CAIR, a terror-linked organization which celebrated the attacks of Oct 7, that America was wrongly accusing Muslims of terrorism. After pages of portraying his subject as an innocent man wrongly monitored by the government, Farivar finally revealed that he had actually been a supporter of an imam linked to a Jihadist group that had operated in Afghanistan and is currently affiliated with ISIS. To what extent did Farivar’s past inform his contemporary coverage of Islamic terrorism? As a teenager, Farivar described joining the Islamic Unity under Abdulrab Rasul Sayyaf,who invited Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan, and whose name would be adopted by the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group currently allied with ISIS, and then attended a Madrassa in Peshawar, Pakistan. While the name of the Madrassa is not given in his memoir, Farivar describes a speech by a sheikh calling them 'the children of Jihad' who will be 'participating in the Jihad'. Sayyaf had founded a Madrassa in Peshawar known as Dawa al-Jihad or the Call of Jihad attended by a number of future terrorists including World Trade Center bombers Ramzi Al-Yousef and Ahmed Ajaj. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, taught there. I reached out to Farivar to inquire if he had studied at the terrorist school, but got no answer. The future VOA analyst returned to Afghanistan twice as a Jihadist. The second time he was fighting with Hezb-i Islami Khalis whose members included Taliban founder Mullah Omar, Mullah Mohammad Rabbani, the Taliban’s prime minister, Mullah Mohammed Ghaus, the Taliban’s future foreign minister, and other major Taliban leaders, and which has been at war with the U.S. But Farivar’s career took a turn toward America due to another USAID program. USAID provided funding to set up a Mujahadeen propaganda network known as the Afghan Media Resource Center. The terror media network, which reportedly required all personnel to 'sacrifice for holy jihad', operated under the auspices of the United States Information Agency (USIA): the parent organization of Voice of America. Through his new role as a ‘journalist’, Farivar met Carlos Mavroleon, a Harvard graduate from a wealthy Greek shipping family who had converted to Islam and taken the name Karimullah, fighting as a Mujahadeen and playing journalist, before dying of a heroin overdose with a Koran on him during an assignment for CBS News. 'In London I fought the Jihad with a pen. Now I fight it with a sword. I have come to Afghanistan to take part in the Jihad,' Carlos had bragged. 'Jihad with a pen' would prove crucial to the next stage of fighting the west from within. Mavroleon and the head of USIAD got Farivar into Harvard. 'I got off the plane with my big Osama bin Laden beard, my Afghan rebel hat and traditional garb,' he later recalled. After graduating, he continued living in the U.S. without a green card although a 'friend with CIA connections' later offered him one. He returned to Afghanistan and met with Taliban’s Minister of Culture Amir Khan Muttaqi, currently its foreign minister, to discuss starting a radio station. In his memoir, Farivar alternately claims to deplore the Taliban, but also admits to liking 'the peace that the Taliban had restored.' When he visited the Taliban leader, it was with 'a letter of introduction from the representative of the Taliban' in New York and after having 'met several Taliban ministers while they were touring the United States.' After 9/11, Farivar popped up in Afghanistan running a USAID-funded 'NPR-like network' while rejecting 'American-funded ads to recruit for the Afghan Army or police'. He joked, 'Sometimes my wife calls me the Taliban.' He told Harvard Magazine that, 'there is some self-censorship, some lines you cannot cross. Islam is a subject that you cannot touch: you can’t piss off the mullahs, can’t offend people’s faith.' Even while U.S. soldiers were fighting Farivar’s old comrades, the U.S. was funding a radio operation that appeared similar to the one that the ex-Jihadi had pitched to the Taliban and which was hostile to American efforts to militarily secure Afghanistan from the Jihadis. Salam Watandar, the Afghan radio network Farivar ran, operated under the umbrella of the Internews Network, an European nonprofit media group funded by everyone from Bill Gates to USAID. From there, Farivar moved to the Voice of America where he transitioned from covering Afghanistan to covering the FBI and the Justice Department. And Trump. Obama had dismantled the firewall keeping the Voice of America from targeting Americans. And the former Jihadist became one of the vehicles for the VOA’s attacks on President Trump. After the rise of Trump, Farivar switched from covering Afghanistan and the Muslim world for domestic coverage that attacked Trump, with articles like 'Hate Crimes Surge After Trump Victory' and 'Timeline: Trump’s Involvements With Russia' others that promoted Islamist narratives 'Most Terrorism Victims Are in Muslim Majority Countries' and 'With Surge in Hate Crime, Muslims Seen ‘Most Disdained’ Minority' or even did both 'How Muslim-Americans Drifted to the Democratic Party' and 'Arab Opinion Poll Shows Support for Clinton'. After the Biden administration raided Mar-a-Lago, Masood Farivar was working the Justice Department, pressing for confirmation that Attorney General Merrick Garland was 'experiencing an uptick in death threats' from Trump supporters. The VOA, an arm of the government, was promoting Russiagate and unsubtly nudging voters to turn against Trump during three presidential elections in violation of its charter and mission. And the man behind some of these articles had been recruited by a related arm of the government back in the 1980s during his days as a Jihadist to engage in a war of propaganda. Now that propaganda was being aimed within the United States against the president. And it’s still going on. A propaganda machine once aimed at America’s enemies is now run by our enemies and aimed at us. The story of Masood Farivar shows why the Voice of America needs urgent reform. Farivar has at times sold himself as a fervent opponent of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, while at other times he appeared willing to collaborate with the Taliban. After 9/11, Farivar argued in his memoir that even though 'radical mujahadeen often hated America as much as they hated the Soviet Union, but the jihad was fundamentally good.' Does America need a ‘good jihad’?

European countries back Arab alternative to Trump’s Gaza plan	Israel and the U.S. have rejected the proposal that envisages the population staying in place and the PA being in charge. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Four major European countries announced Saturday that they back an Arab plan for reconstructing the Gaza Strip that both Israel and the U.S. have rejected. The foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the UK said in a joint statement that the $53 billion proposal 'shows a realistic path' to rebuilding the war-devastated enclave and that they were 'committed to working' with it. The statement also said that Hamas could have no part in ruling the Strip, noting that 'We are clear that Hamas must neither govern Gaza nor be a threat to Israel anymore.' However, the plan, introduced by Egypt last week and approved by the Arab League and the 57 states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, does not state this. It notes the difficulties in disarming the terrorist groups in Gaza by saying vaguely, 'It is something that can be dealt with, and even ended forever, only if its causes are removed through a clear horizon and a credible political process.' The proposal calls for a supposedly independent panel of Palestinian technocrats managing Gazan affairs for six months, including the overseeing of humanitarian aid delivery, with international troops keeping the peace under the auspices of the UN. Egypt and Jordan would spend the time training Palestinian Authority (PA) police officers to assert law and order, and then the PA would take control of the Strip. The plan also envisages massive improvements for the enclave as well, including a commercial harbor, a technology hub, beach hotels, and an airport. The PA has several well-trained police and security forces already, with some of them having been taught by the Americans through the U.S. Security Coordinator’s Office, which has worked with the Authority since 2007. The Europeans said that they 'support the central role for the Palestinian Authority and the implementation of its reform agenda.' There has been little sign of any reforms taking place in the PA, an idea pushed by the previous, Biden administration before the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 invasion of Israel that sparked the war that has destroyed most urban areas in Gaza. The PA’s leaders have never condemned the mass murder and abductions that Hamas carried out that day, limiting their censure to the fact that their chief rival’s actions led to massive loss of life and destruction. Since the PA also still publicly and financially supports terrorism against Israel, the government has categorically and repeatedly rejected the PA as a viable alternative to Hamas. Unlike the plan floated by U.S. President Donald Trump to turn Gaza into the 'Riviera of the Middle East,' the Arab one says all the inhabitants should stay put while their homes and cities are rebuilt. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said Tuesday that the plan 'does not address the current reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable,' as it is 'covered in rubble and unexploded ordnance.' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Thursday that the plan 'does not meet the expectations' of the White House.

US support for Israel falls to all-time low – poll	Most Americans back formation of Palestinian state, while majority of Republicans oppose Palestinian statehood, new poll finds. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News American support for Israel over the Palestinian Authority has fallen to the lowest level ever recorded, according to a new poll released last week, hitting a nearly 25-year low. On Thursday, Gallup released the results of a poll conducted between February 3rd through the 16th which found that the percentage of Americans who say they sympathize more with the Palestinians than with the Israelis rose to the highest level since the pollster began asking the question in 2001, in the midst of the Second Intifada. While just 26% of respondents said they sympathize more with Palestinians than with Israelis in 2022 - a year before the October 7th, 2023 invasion of Israel - that figure rose to 31% in 2023 and to 33% last February. By comparison, the percentage of Americans who say they sympathize more with Israelis fell to just 46%, the lowest figure on record, down from 51% in 2024, 54% in 2023, and 55% in 2022. A majority of Americans support the establishment of a Palestinian state, the poll found, with 55% backing Palestinian statehood in Judea, Samaria, ang the Gaza Strip, compared to 31% who oppose it. That is the second highest level of support for Palestinian statehood on record according to the poll, behind 2003, when 58% of respondents backed the establishment of a Palestinian state. The poll also confirmed the presence of a wide partisan gap on support for Israel - found in a number of other polls in recent years - with Republicans far more likely to back Israel and less likely to sympathize with Palestinians or to back Palestinian statehood. While 76% of Democrats and 53% of Independents say they support Palestinian statehood, just 41% of Republicans agreed, for a partisan gap of 35 points In 2012, when Gallup began asking the question, the partisan gap between Democratic and Republican support for Palestinian statehood was just 21 points. The percentage of Democrats who sympathize with Israelis more than with Palestinians has collapsed over the past decade. While over half (51%) of Democrats sympathized with Israelis over the Palestinians in 2001, a figure that increased slightly to 58% in 2014, Democratic support for Israel has fallen dramatically since, declining to 44% in 2020, 38% in 2023, and 21% in 2025. Support for the Palestinians, by contrast, has soared among Democrats, with just 16% saying they sympathized more with Palestinians in 2001, compared to 59% in 2025. Among Republicans, support for Israel is higher today (75%) than it was in 2001 (59%), though it remains below the peak reported in 2018, when 87% of Republicans sympathized with Israelis over Palestinians. Just 40% of respondents told Gallup they approve of President Donald Trump's handling of the situation between Israel and the Palestinians, below his overall approval rating of 45%.

Time running out: What we know about how Israel could strike Iran	This time, even if Israel strikes alone, Iran promises to retaliate throughout the region. Therefore, a regional defensive setup is required, led by the U.S. of course. By Ariel Kahana, JNS 'History won’t end after a strike on Iran,' says a foreign diplomat. His brief statement effectively summarizes numerous discussions and complex dilemmas faced by many people in multiple countries right now. On one hand, action against Iran isn’t a question of if, simply because no other option remains. On the other hand, we’re not talking about one bombing run and we’re done, as the military challenge is substantial with implications and effects far beyond a localized confrontation between Israel and Iran. Let’s start with the conclusion: Very little time remains to address Iran’s nuclear program. The Islamic Republic is placing its underground nuclear infrastructure so deep that even the American bunker-busting bomb will eventually be unable to penetrate it. 'It will be so deep that conventional weapons won’t be able to do the job,' in the diplomat’s words. Meanwhile, the latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency determined that, 'if Iran decides to produce weapons-grade uranium [90% enrichment] instead of [the current] 60%, it could do so quickly … [and create] enough stockpile to produce four to five nuclear weapons within about one month,' as summarized by the Institute for Science and International Security based on the IAEA findings. As is widely known, Iran’s nuclear infrastructure is scattered throughout the vast country. This means 'hit and run' scenarios involving a small number of aircraft, like those executed by the Israeli Air Force in Iraq in 1981 or Syria in 2007, are irrelevant. Against multiple sites, some of which are underground, many more aircraft would be needed, possibly in multiple waves of attacks. How many? Zohar Palti, who has filled numerous key security positions, claimed in Nadav Perry’s podcast that the United States is capable of neutralizing Iran’s nuclear program in eight hours, but an American source I spoke with believes this estimate is too optimistic. According to the source, the question is how much damage one wants to inflict on the Iranian project. Second, there are likely softening and preparation operations needed before the eight hours of striking the system itself. Therefore, according to this source, the Americans would need two days to eliminate Iran’s nuclear program. Either way, even if eight hours is sufficient for the Americans, the Israeli Air Force, lacking the bombs they possess, would need much more time. Furthermore, a strike on Iran wouldn’t begin and end with Israeli Air Force sorties, but would require such extensive regional preparations that they couldn’t be concealed. This means Israel could send and return aircraft alone and by surprise, but both Israeli and American officials doubt the feasibility of such an attack. First, because if Israel wanted to achieve surprise, the American detection and warning system would quickly discover Israeli activity. Indeed, if we don’t update CENTCOM in advance, there could even be friction between our aircraft and their American counterparts. Second, even if the Americans don’t participate in the actual strike, it would be very advantageous for Israel to receive real-time defensive assistance from President Donald Trump. Reports in American media claimed that during Israel’s operation in Iran last fall, American forces stood ready to rescue our pilots if, God forbid, any were shot down over Iranian skies. Additionally, Iran could respond in real time by firing missiles at Israel, at American bases in the region, or at U.S. allies. And of course, Iran might respond later, and indeed has threatened to do so if the worst happens from its perspective—the destruction of its nuclear project. A Chinese ship Although Israel significantly damaged Iran’s missile array, the ayatollahs still have quite a few left. They aren’t resting on their laurels either, and according to international media reports, a Chinese ship carrying fuel used for cruise missiles recently docked in Iran. Additionally, the Houthis in Yemen are fully engaged, as are militias in Iraq and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Yes, the organization has suffered a severe blow, but it still retains numerous capabilities. Or take Azerbaijan, an Israeli ally and bitter enemy of the ayatollahs. Baku, which has already suffered terrorist attacks from Iran, is in its crosshairs if Israel acts. It’s worth remembering that even between Iran and Pakistan, rounds of exchanges of fire and bombings occurred, indirectly related to the rivalry with Israel. In other words, action in Iran could ignite areas much more extensive than a missile war between Jerusalem and Tehran. To minimize the damage from such a development, a regional defensive deployment is needed, more extensive than the one in which the international coalition prepared to thwart previous Iranian attacks on Israel. On those two occasions, only Israel was bombed. The coalition’s defense greatly minimized Iran’s effectiveness. This time, even if Israel strikes alone, Iran promises to retaliate throughout the region. Therefore, a regional defensive setup is required, led by the U.S. of course. Its preparation takes weeks, and that can’t be hidden either. So in any case and scenario, advance coordination with the Americans seems necessary. Israel would like to see American partnership in the attack, not just in defense. But the question is how interested is President Trump. Due to fears of a regional war, former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden didn’t want Israel to bomb Iran. Trump is less risk-averse than those two, but he’s also not eager for battle. At the opening of his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House a month ago, I asked the president, 'Now that Iran is at its weakest, isn’t it time to take military action against its nuclear program?' Trump disputed the premise of the question. 'You say Iran is weak, but it’s very strong. Biden strengthened it by transferring billions to them. We’ll impose sanctions on it,' the president replied. Indeed, at this stage, Trump is again trying 'maximum pressure' through economic sanctions on Iran and its officials. Military action isn’t in his cards right now, apparently. At the same time, he’s asking Russia to mediate between him and Iran to reach a new nuclear deal. So currently, his focus is diplomatic, not military. The issue is that there’s no chance sanctions or a renewed agreement will cause the ayatollahs to stop their nuclear program. If they rejected Biden’s concessions, they certainly won’t bridge the gap with Trump’s tougher demands. As for sanctions, history teaches that only rarely have they caused countries to retreat from what they saw as serving their national security. Iran has been under economic and other sanctions for 40 years. This hasn’t really affected it. There’s no reason to think that now, when its on the threshold of a bomb, something will change. It’s possible that before turning to the military option—or authorizing Israel to do so—Trump wants to exhaust diplomatic tools. Stopping wars around the world was one of his campaign promises. In other words, he’ll give sanctions and negotiations a few months. When these fail, he’ll make decisions. The moment of truth this fall This is the assessment of Dan Shapiro, who held a senior position in the Pentagon during the Biden administration and was previously U.S. ambassador to Israel. According to Shapiro, the preparations themselves (for military action) will signal to Iran that we’re serious. There must be a credible military threat on the table. The moment of truth (whether to act or not) will come this fall. Shapiro made those comments at an Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) conference in Tel Aviv. He added that Iran is in its weakest position as a result of the severe damage to its air defense system last fall by Israel. In his assessment, the U.S. has significantly better capabilities than Israel, but Israel can cause significant damage to Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. In any case, it will need U.S. assistance, as happened in Israel’s attack on Iran in October. Among professionals, opinions are divided on whether Iranian skies are completely exposed, or the Islamic Republic retains significant defensive capabilities. Here, too, we must assume Iran isn’t wasting time and is using every day to install new radars and anti-aircraft missile batteries. What, then, will be the practical outcome of all these discussions? Very senior officials in Israel repeatedly say at every opportunity that they 'aren’t taking their eyes off the ball,' meaning they’re aware of the opportunities, risks and urgency. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Tuesday, in response to reports that Russia would mediate a nuclear deal between Iran and the U.S., that 'there is zero chance there will be a nuclear agreement. The Nazi ayatollahs want to destroy Israel. President Trump needs to give Israel the tools to destroy Iran’s nuclear program.' The previous day, Netanyahu declared in the Knesset that 'there are things better left unspoken, better done quietly.' He is, of course, right, provided that this time they finally get done.

Houthis threaten to resume attacks on Israeli ships over Gaza sup...	If war returns to Gaza, we will rain fire upon all areas of the enemy regime [Israel], especially Tel Aviv, which is known as occupied Jaffa,' he said in a statement marking the start of Ramadan. By JNS Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi terrorists have threatened to once more attack Israeli shipping unless aid supplies to Gaza are allowed to resume, its leader said on Friday. 'If the Israeli enemy continues after the first four days to prevent the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip … then we will resume our naval operations against the Israeli enemy,' Abdul-Malik al-Houthi warned in a televised address on Friday. This would mean that Houthi attacks would restart on Tuesday. The Houthis previously carried out drone and missile strikes on shipping in the Red Sea during the Gaza war in support of the Hamas terrorist group, halting its attacks following the ceasefire that began on Jan. 19. Al-Houthi on Feb. 28 threatened to restart missile attacks on Israeli territory, warning that Tel Aviv would be in the crosshairs again if Jerusalem resumes combat against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 'If war returns to Gaza, we will rain fire upon all areas of the enemy regime [Israel], especially Tel Aviv, which is known as occupied Jaffa,' he said in a statement marking the start of Ramadan. The Israeli government announced on March 2 that it had suspended all humanitarian aid to Gaza after Hamas rejected the ceasefire extension proposed by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. The U.S. State Department re-designated the Houthis in Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization on March 4. The move came a little more than a month after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling on the department to issue the reclassification.

Israeli ambulances vandalized with swastikas while responding to ...	Two ambulances responding to an emergency call in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem vandalized, with swastikas spray-painted over the Israeli flag. By World Israel News Staff A pair of ambulances operated by the Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency first responder organization were vandalized by radical, anti-Zionist members of the ultra-Orthodox community overnight. The incident occurred before dawn Sunday morning, while two teams of MDA paramedics, dispatched in two separate ambulances, responded to an emergency call in the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Meah Shearim in Jerusalem. As the paramedics were busy treating a patient in their apartment, the vandal or vandals spray-painted swastikas over the Israeli flags adorning the sides of the two ambulances. 'Last night, at around 3:00 AM, Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance and intensive care teams were dispatched to treat a patient in the Meah Shearim neighborhood of Jerusalem,' an MDA spokesperson announced Sunday. 'While paramedics and medics entered the patient’s apartment to provide medical care, unidentified individuals vandalized the MDA ambulances, drawing swastikas on the Israeli flags affixed to the vehicle's sides.' 'When the teams returned to their vehicles, they were shocked to discover the serious act of vandalism and immediately reported it to the Jerusalem police, filing an official complaint.' MDA Director-General Eli Bin castigated the vandals and called on police to 'take action' against those responsible. 'This is a severe and appalling incident that has no place in our society. MDA teams are on the ground to save lives, regardless of religion, race, or nationality, and they must be able to carry out their mission without fear of violence or property damage,' Bin said. 'We trust law enforcement authorities to take action and hold those responsible for this despicable act accountable.'

Anti-Israel activist who scaled Big Ben with Palestinian flag arr...	The man stayed on the tower for 16 hours after threatening to climb higher if the authorities approached. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A man who climbed partway up London's iconic Big Ben Saturday morning with a Palestinian flag was arrested after agreeing to leave and being brought to the ground via a crane 16 hours later. The anti-Israel protestor had scrambled up several dozen meters while barefoot and wearing no safety harness around 7:20 AM. He came to stop on a small triangular ledge with a decorative post jutting upward in front of him. The man wrapped a keffiyeh around the post, and periodically waved the flag and called out 'Free Palestine.' The authorities, who arrived quickly, closed the famous clock’s Elizabeth Tower at the Palace of Westminster in central London. The Tower is considered part of the Houses of Parliament. Tours of Parliament were cancelled, and access to the site was restricted, with the police shutting down Westminster Bridge, a main entry leading from the local subway station, and forbidding any other protest activity. They cordoned off at a distance a small group on the ground who echoed the protestor’s 'Free Palestine' calls, as well as shouting out to him, 'You are a hero!' Many video clips of the scene were posted throughout the day to Instagram by the man himself as well as onlookers. In one, the bespectacled, black-clad climber told negotiators who had been lifted to his height via a fire truck’s ladder that he would descend 'on his own terms.' 'If you come towards me you are putting me in danger and I will climb higher,' he also threatened. In another clip he uploaded, the man mixed in climate issues with his Middle East agenda. 'Democracy is dead, when people are sent to prison for nonviolent civil disobedience protests, when climate activists get three to four years in prison, when activists for Palestine are imprisoned for doing what the government should do, stop weapons from being sent to the terrorist state of Israel,' he said. At one point, one of the negotiators said, 'At some point you're going to have to come down, how long do you think you're going to be up there?' One of the videos the man posted indicated that he had originally planned to stay on the Tower for three and a half days. In the event, just around midnight, the man was convinced to come down, and was promptly arrested. 'This has been a protracted incident due to the specifics of where the man was located and the need to ensure the safety of our officers, the individual and the wider public,' the police said after the incident was over. 'We worked with other agencies including the London Fire Brigade and deployed specialist officers to bring this incident to a close as quickly as possible whilst minimising risk to life.'

Qatar demands supervision of alleged Israeli nuclear sites	In apparently political move, Qatar urges inspection of alleged Israeli nuclear facilities, while complaining about restrictions on UNRWA. By World Israel News Staff Qatar urged Israel to allow International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections of its alleged nuclear facilities, calling for the move during an IAEA meeting in Austria on Saturday. According to a statement from the Qatari Foreign Ministry, the country's ambassador to the United Nations, Jassim Yacoub Al-Hammadi, also called on Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 'Hammadi underscored the need for the international community and its institutions to uphold their commitments under resolutions of the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly, the IAEA, and the 1995 Review Conference of the NPT, which called on Israel to subject all its nuclear facilities to IAEA safeguards,' the statement reads. Al-Hammaid 'noted that some of these resolutions explicitly urged Israel to join the NPT as a non-nuclear state.' The abrupt demand from Qatar appeared to be political in nature, as it included unrelated complaints about Israel's anti-terror strategy and its decision to ban UNRWA from operating on its territory. The letter characterized anti-terror raids as 'intensifying military operations against cities and refugee camps' in Palestinian Authority-controlled enclaves in Judea and Samaria. It also claimed that Jerusalem 'has a duty' to allow UNRWA to operate on Israeli soil. The statement did not acknowledge Hamas' deep infiltration of UNRWA, nor the fact that UNRWA employees participated in the October 7th terror onslaught and carried out atrocities, including kidnapping women and bodies of murdered Israelis. Israel has never publicly acknowledged that it possesses nuclear weapons. A June 2024 assessment by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute suggested that Israel had 90 nuclear weapons in its stockpile. Leaked emails from former U.S. Secretary of Defense Colin Powell included claims that Israel has '200 nuclear weapons, all targeted on Tehran.'

Evangelical Christians: ‘God is giving Israel a blank check’	We Christians are calling on our beloved President Trump and his team to aggressively remove all barriers to Israel’s sovereignty over all the land, including Judea and Samaria,' says Evangelical pastor. By World Israel News Staff Evangelical Christians are urging President Donald Trump to recognize Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, telling the New York Times that the current moment is right for restoring Israel's borders according to Biblical history. Widely regarded as the most pro-Israel president in American history, Trump hinted in mid-February that he would make an announcement about annexation of the territory in the coming weeks. Last week, several major Evangelical leaders, including Ralph Reed, Tony Perkins and Mario Bramnick, visited Jerusalem for a conference last week. 'We strongly support and think it is imperative that Israeli sovereignty be expressed, extended and recognized over Judea and Samaria,' Ralph Reed, founder and chairman of the Faith and Freedom Caucus, told JNS during the conference. 'Recognizing Israeli sovereignty is indispensable for Israel to provide security to its own people,' Reed added. 'I literally feel God is giving Israel a blank check,' Bramnick, the pastor of a major church in Florida and the president of the Latino Coalition for Israel, told the New York Times. Bramnick's perspective is shared by many other leaders in the Evangelical Christian community, who are urging Trump to assist in streamlining recognition of Judea and Samaria as officially being Israeli territory. 'We Christians are calling on our beloved President Trump and his team to aggressively remove all barriers to Israel’s sovereignty over all the land, including Judea and Samaria,' said Terri Copeland Pearsons, a prominent pastor, while speaking at the National Religious Broadcasters convention last Thursday. In a media statement, Binyamin Regional Council chairman Israel Ganz stressed the importance of annexation for national security. 'The application of Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria is a necessary step to ensure the safety of Israel and the future of Jewish communities in the region,' Ganz said. 'We are grateful to our American leaders for their support and hope during President Trump’s tenure that we can make progress on this crucial issue for Israel’s security and regional stability.'

Hamas agrees to release additional hostages as Israel dispatches ...	The Hamas terror organization has reportedly agreed to extend phase one of the ceasefire and to release a number of additional living hostages, as Israel dispatches a negotiating team for truce talks in Doha. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel has agreed to resume talks in Doha, Qatar to reboot the lapsed ceasefire deal with the Hamas terror organization, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced Saturday night. According to the Prime Minister's Office, Israel has accepted an invitation to join talks backed by the U.S., and will send a delegation to Doha on Monday 'in an effort to advance the negotiations.' An Israeli official told The Times of Israel that the delegation will be led by former IDF general Gal Hirsch, who was tapped by the Israeli government after October 7th to oversee efforts to return Israelis taken captive in Gaza. The delegation will reportedly also include top Netanyahu aid Ophir Falk and a senior member of the Shin Bet security agency, whose identity was not released, in place of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. Netanyahu recently dropped Bar from Israel's negotiating team, among a public feud between the two, and amid reports the premier is preparing to fire Bar from the Shin Bet. Israel's decision to send a new delegation to Doha comes amid reports that Hamas has agreed to release several living Israeli hostages in exchange for a continuation of the truce in Gaza, extending the framework of the first phase of the hostage deal. Reports by the Saudi Al Hadath and Al Arabiya outlets claimed that Hamas has agreed to an American proposal to continue the first phase of the ceasefire - releasing Israeli hostages in exchange for a continuation of the truce and the release of jailed Arab terrorists. According to Al Arabiya, Hamas has agreed to extend the ceasefire on the basis of the U.S. proposal at least through the end of Ramadan on March 29th. Al Hadath, however, claimed Hamas has agreed to a two-month extension of the ceasefire. A report by Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, claimed that the U.S. is pushing a proposal under which Hamas would free ten living hostages during a two-month ceasefire. Israeli intelligence indicates that 34 to 35 of the remaining 59 hostages in captivity are dead, with 24 or 25 believed to be still alive.

Ex-hostage to rabbi: ‘I was saved by God’s mercy alone’	Even there, in the great darkness, I felt that I was not alone, and faith in God strengthened me,' Alexander Trufanov tells prominent rabbi. By World Israel News Staff Former hostage Alexander (Sasha) Trufanov visited the home of a prominent rabbi last week to thank him for his prayers, stressing that he credited God with his freedom. Trufanov met with Rabbi Yitzhak Silberstein in Bnei Brak, who gifted the ex-captive with a tallit (prayer shawl.) According to a Ynet report, Silberstein was moved to tears while blessing the tallit for Trufanov, in a deeply emotional moment. In recent months, Silberstein met with the families of numerous hostages, and led prayers for their safe return. Trufanov told the rabbi that he 'knew that people were praying' for him while he was in captivity. 'Even there, in the great darkness, I felt that I was not alone, and faith in God strengthened me,' he added. 'I was freed only by the grace of God and not by anything else.' Zilberstein urged Trufanov to continue deepening his faith, saying he had become a symbol for the Jewish people. 'Jewish history will remember you and the other abductees, and you can no longer see yourself as a private individual,' the rabbi said. 'You must continue to sanctify the name of God.' He added that Trufanov 'should serve as an example of the spiritual strength of the people of Israel, which continues to exist and prevail despite all the trials and complex challenges.' On October 7th, Trufanov was kidnapped by Islamic Jihad terrorists alongside his grandmother, mother, and girlfriend from the family home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. Trufanov's father, Vitaly, was murdered in the terror onslaught. Although the family had previously been secular, Trufanov's mother began keeping Shabbat while in captivity - a practice she has maintained even after her release in a December 2023 hostage deal. Trufnaov's girlfriend, Sapir Cohen, has spoken to the media about her time in captivity, emphasizing that her faith in God was the only thing that sustained her throughout her ordeal.

Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer slams US envoy for direct t...	Boehler insisted that these were only initial talks and emphasized that no agreements would be made without Israel's approval. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer reportedly criticized Trump Administration hostage envoy Adam Boehler for holding direct talks with Hamas regarding the release of hostages. During a phone call last week, Dermer expressed his dissatisfaction with Boehler for meeting with a senior Hamas delegation led by Khalil al-Hayya in Doha. Dermer was upset that Boehler discussed the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for one living US citizen and the bodies of four deceased American hostages. In his defense, Boehler argued that these were only initial talks and emphasized that no agreements would be made without Israel's approval. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposed the idea of direct talks between the US and Hamas when the Trump Administration proposed it last month. According to Ynet, Israel was behind the leak of the direct negotiations between the US and Hamas in an attempt to derail them. On Wednesday, media outlets reported that US officials were taking the unprecedented step of negotiating directly with Hamas, overturning established US policy of avoiding talks with terror groups. Jerusalem is displeased with these direct negotiations, particularly because Israeli officials were only informed of the talks after they occurred, contrary to the claim by US officials that Israel had been fully briefed. The US chose not to inform Israel of the meeting between Trump hostage envoy Adam Boehler and Hamas ahead of time because a similar meeting had previously been canceled due to opposition from Israel. Boehler proceeded with the meeting, focusing on the need to secure the release of one living American hostage, Eden Alexander, as well as the bodies of four deceased US citizens: Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai, and Judith Weinstein. Israel is reportedly concerned that the talks may prioritize the release of US hostages, leading the US to lose interest in the matter once they are freed. Israel’s efforts to interfere with the negotiations by leaking information may have had an impact, as the talks are reportedly facing challenges.

Israeli woman gang-raped during deadly attack in India	One man killed, two women gang-raped in incident near a popular tourist destination in India's Karnataka state in southwestern India. By World Israel News Staff Two women, including one Israeli national, were gang-raped, and one man murdered, during an attack on a group of tourists and the operator of a guesthouse in southwestern India last week. The incident occurred last Thursday night near a lake in Hampi, in the Indian state of Karnataka, local authorities said over the weekend. A group of four tourists, including a 27-year-old Israeli woman, a 23-year-old American man, and two Indian men visiting from another part of the country, were out stargazing that night with a 29-year-old woman who runs a guesthouse. The five were reportedly at a temple adjacent to the Tungabhadra Canal in Sanapur, near the Hampi The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization-designated World Heritage site, when they were accosted by a motorcycle gang. Three men who approached the group on their motorcycles asked for directions to a gas station. While one of the five victims gave the bikers directions, one of the three bikers demanded 100 rupees ($1.15) from the tourists. 'Since the homestay operator did not know them, she told them they had no money,' police superintendent Ram Arasiddi told Reuters. 'When the men repeatedly insisted, one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees. 'After that, the three men allegedly started arguing.' During the ensuing confrontation, the three bikers beat the male tourists and threw them into the Tungabhadra Canal. They then proceeded to gang-rape the Israeli tourist and the Indian hostess. Two of the male tourists, including the American citizen and one of the two Indians, managed to swim to safety. However, the third male tourist was not spotted by the shore, and was declared missing. His body was later found, after he apparently drowned. The four surviving victims were evacuated to a government hospital for treatment. Authorities say it appears the attack was premeditated, and that they believe the assailants had followed the stargazers. A senior Karnataka official said that two of the three suspects are now in custody. 'The attack and rape of an Israeli citizen and homestay owner is a most heinous act,' Chief Minister of Karnataka Siddaramaiah tweeted. 'As soon as the incident was reported, I obtained information from the relevant police, conducted a thorough investigation, and instructed them to quickly identify the culprits.' 'The police have arrested two accused in connection with the case and are continuing the investigation.'

Iranian darknet site caught supplying deadly fentanyl to American...	According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were an estimated 74,702 overdose deaths from the synthetic opioid last year. By Jewish Breaking News Iran has found a new way to harm Americans and it’s not through bombs or guns. For three years, Nemesis operated on the dark web, accessible only to those with specialized browsers designed to mask their identity and location. With 1,000 vendors selling narcotics, counterfeit identification documents, and hacking services, the site processed nearly $30 million in sales. Nemesis had just one boss named Behrouz Parsarad. Working beyond the reach of American law enforcement in Iran, he designed the marketplace, controlled its operations, and handled all its finances. When international authorities finally seized Nemesis’ servers in March, more than 150,000 user accounts and over 1,100 seller accounts were reported to be registered on the site. Particularly concerning to authorities was the selling of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid responsible for tens of thousands of American overdose deaths annually. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were an estimated 74,702 overdose deaths from the synthetic opioid last year. It’s considered to be 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. Just 2 milligrams of fentanyl is considered a lethal dose. Despite losing his marketplace, Parsarad hasn’t lost his criminal connections. Intelligence gathered in the weeks following the takedown shows the Iranian operator maintaining contact with his vendor network in an effort to relaunch. In response, Treasury officials moved on Wednesday to impose sanctions on his American assets including 49 cryptocurrency wallets. 'As the administrator of the Nemesis darknet marketplace, Parsarad sought to build—and continues to try to re-establish—a safe haven to facilitate the production, sale, and shipment of illegal narcotics like fentanyl and other synthetic opioids,' said Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. 'Treasury, in partnership with U.S. law enforcement, will use all available tools to dismantle these darknet marketplaces and hold accountable the individuals who oversee them.'

Trump: ‘We’re down to the final moments with Iran’	In an interview with Fox Business conducted on Thursday, Trump said he sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Wednesday. By Andrew Bernard, JNS U.S. President Donald Trump hinted on Friday that the United States could take military action against the Iranian nuclear program 'very soon' if the Islamic Republic does not strike a deal with the United States. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said that there would be 'interesting days ahead' with respect to Iran. 'We’re down to final strokes with Iran,' Trump said, using a golf metaphor. 'We’re down to the final moments. We’re at final moments. Can’t let them have a nuclear weapon.' The International Atomic Energy Agency announced in a pair of reports in late February that Iran has 'significantly increased' its production of uranium enriched to 60% purity, just shy of the 90% level considered 'weapons-grade' for use in a nuclear bomb. While Iran claims its nuclear program is peaceful, there is no civilian use for 60% enriched uranium and Iran is the only non-nuclear weapons state that produces such material. Roughly 92.5 pounds of 60% enriched uranium is the 'approximate amount of nuclear material for which the possibility of manufacturing a nuclear explosive device cannot be excluded,' according to the IAEA. As of Feb. 8, Iran has about 605 pounds of 60% enriched uranium. Trump said on Friday that whatever comes next between the United States and Iran, 'it’s going to be a big thing.' 'We have a situation with Iran, that something’s going to happen very soon—very, very soon,' Trump said. 'Hopefully, we could have a peace deal. I’m not speaking out of strength or weakness. I’m just saying I’d rather see a peace deal than the other, but the other will solve the problem.' In an interview with Fox Business conducted on Thursday, Trump said he sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Wednesday. 'I said, ‘I hope you’re going to negotiate because it’s going to be a lot better for Iran,’' Trump said of the letter. 'There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily or you make a deal,' he added. 'I would prefer to make a deal because I’m not looking to hurt Iran.'

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Iran criticized Egypt's plan for rebuilding Gaza, stating that a 'one-state solution' is the only viable path forward for the Palestinians. Iran voiced its opposition to the Arab plan for Gaza during a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Last week, Arab leaders approved an Egyptian reconstruction plan for Gaza, which is set to cost $53 billion and aims to prevent the displacement of Palestinians from the enclave, in contrast to US President Donald Trump's 'Middle East Riviera' vision. Iran’s Foreign Minister, Abbas Araqchi, criticized the plan for not explicitly calling for the elimination of Israel and stated that the two-state solution 'will not guarantee Palestinian rights.' He reaffirmed Tehran's support for a single state that represents all the original inhabitants of Palestine. Araqchi remarked, 'While we respect the views of some brotherly nations regarding the two-state solution, the Islamic Republic of Iran maintains that this approach will not fulfill the rights of the Palestinian people.' He added, 'In our view, a ‘one democratic state’ representing all the original inhabitants of Palestine is the only viable solution.' Araqchi accused Israel of ongoing defiance of the UN Charter, its labeling of the UN Secretary-General as persona non grata, and its obstruction of UNRWA’s operations. He argued that these actions make it essential to continue efforts to expel the Israeli regime from the United Nations. The Arab plan for Gaza was unveiled at a summit on March 4. Regarding the governance of Gaza, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi stated that Egypt has collaborated with the Palestinians to establish an administrative committee composed of independent, professional Palestinian technocrats, who will be responsible for governing Gaza once the war concludes. The proposal to remove Hamas from official leadership in Gaza may be viewed by Iran as a threat to its influence in the region.

Preparations completed for Gazan migration	The IDF has prepared land, air, and sea routes for Gazans who want to voluntarily leave the Strip and seek a better life elsewhere. By Ariel Kahana, JNS Israel has completed the necessary preparations to enable the migration of Gaza residents, provided countries are found willing to accept them. In recent weeks, a mechanism has been established, under the direction of Defense Minister Israel Katz, designed to create conditions that would allow 2,500 Gazans to leave the Strip daily. Currently, more than two million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip. Security sources told Israel Hayom that one country has already expressed interest in accepting construction workers from Gaza, but international controversy surrounding the issue has caused it to freeze its involvement in the matter for the time being. Migration to destination countries could be carried out via sea, with passage through Israel at Ashdod Port. An additional route, by air, would be through Ramon Airport, near Eilat. It should be noted that this route has been operating for several months for wounded individuals who have left the Strip, and approximately 1,500 Gaza residents are known to have left via this route to other countries. Another departure route is the Rafah Crossing. Through this crossing, according to information available to Israel, about 35,000 people have evacuated from the Strip to Egypt since the beginning of the current war. In many cases, they continued from Egypt to other destinations around the world. Israel is interested in allowing as many Gaza residents as possible to leave the Strip. Therefore, the policy is to allow family members of sick and wounded individuals to leave with them to other countries. In the vast majority of cases, those who left Gaza were absorbed into Arab countries, but there are also those who have migrated to Romania and Italy with the intention of not returning. 'Our interest is to let as many people as possible leave. That’s the rationale of the Trump plan that Israel has expressed support for. We are trying to implement it,' said a security source. Meanwhile, The Israeli Reservists—Generation of Victory movement has published its own framework for the voluntary migration of Gaza residents, based on principles of international law. The plan proposes the removal of 1.7 million Gazans via air, sea and land routes to host countries around the world, including Egypt, Libya and Gulf states. The initiative includes full funding for departure from Gaza, temporary housing solutions, and a financial grant for migrants, at an estimated cost of up to $100 billion—less than the cost of rehabilitating the Strip. According to Maj. (res.) Gilad Ach, chairman of the movement: 'We are presenting an orderly plan to remove the ongoing threat to Israeli citizens from the Gaza Strip. … A one-time opportunity has now been created to exploit the window of opportunity opened by the current U.S. administration.'

Jerusalem is displeased with direct talks between the US and Hamas, particularly because the Israeli Prime Minister was informed of the talks only after the fact. Israel was behind the leak of the direct negotiations between the US and Hamas in order to derail them, Ynet reports. On Wednesday, the media reported the news that US officials were making the unprecedented move of negotiating directly with Hamas, overturning the established US policy of not holding talks directly with terror groups. Jerusalem is displeased with direct talks, particularly because the Israeli Prime Minister was informed of the talks only after the fact, contrary to the insistence of US officials that Israel was fully informed of the matter. The US decided against informing Israel of the meeting between Trump hostage envoy Adam Boehler and Hamas ahead of time because a similar meeting had been canceled previously due to opposition from Israel. Boehler went ahead with the meeting, emphasizing the need to release one living American hostage, Eden Alexander, and the bodies of four deceased US citizens: Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai, and Judith Weinstein. Israel is reportedly concerned that the talks would emphasize the release of US hostages to the point that the US could possibly lose interest in the issue once they are released. Israel's efforts to interfere with the negotiations through the leak may have had an effect because the talks are reportedly hitting a snag. US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff attempted to allay Israel's concerns by saying that the US would push for the release of all the hostages, but added that Alexander and the bodies of the four deceased American hostages are a priority. 'Eden Alexander is very important to us — as all the hostages are — but Eden Alexander is an American, and he’s injured, so he’s a top priority for us,' Witkoff told reporters outside the White House. Witkoff said the release of Alexander was discussed directly during the talks and expressed regret that the negotiations have not yet been fruitful.

In a follow-up question, Witkoff said that any action would 'principally come from the Israelis' but with 'very, very strong physical and emotional support from the United States.' By Andrew Bernard, JNS Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, told reporters on Thursday that the United States and Israel could take joint military action against Hamas if negotiations with the terrorist group fail. Speaking with journalists outside the White House, Witkoff was asked if there was a deadline to advance a deal to release more hostages before Israel resumes combat operations in the Gaza Strip. 'There definitely is such a date, but I’m not at liberty to discuss what that is,' Witkoff said. 'It’s unclear exactly what’s going to happen. I think there’s going to be some action taken. It could be jointly with the Israelis.' In a follow-up question, Witkoff said that any action would 'principally come from the Israelis' but with 'very, very strong physical and emotional support from the United States.' The White House confirmed on Wednesday that it has engaged in talks with Hamas, marking the first time that the United States has publicly acknowledged negotiating without regional mediators with the designated foreign terrorist organization. U.S. President Donald Trump ruled out giving cash payments to the terrorist group while speaking with reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. He responded ambiguously when asked about a potential joint U.S.-Israeli strike. 'You’re gonna find out,' Trump said. 'Somebody’s gonna have to get a lot rougher than they’re getting.' Witkoff said that he was unsure if Adam Boehler, the U.S. special envoy for hostage affairs, had engaged with Hamas directly or used a go-between to speak with members of the terrorist group. Hamas officials said Wednesday that they had direct meetings with Boehler in Qatar, per the AFP. Phase 1 of the ceasefire-for-hostages deal between Israel and Hamas expired on March 1, with Hamas rejecting Israel’s proposal for an extension. Witkoff indicated that the White House is no longer concerned with the strict three-phase parameters that the Biden administration negotiated after Trump issued a 'last warning' to Hamas on Wednesday to 'release all of the hostages now.' 'People define it as ‘an extension of Phase 1,’ or ‘Phase 2.’ I don’t really care what we call it,' Witkoff said. 'What we call it is: Are we going to have a resolution? Are we going to have a peace deal? Are we going to get all of those hostages home, which is the aim of the Trump administration?' Washington offered Hamas a 60-day truce extension in exchange for the release of 10 living hostages, Sky News Arabia reported on Thursday, citing an 'informed' Palestinian source. Witkoff said Hamas hasn’t been 'forthright' so far in its negotiations but expressed hope that its behavior would improve. 'Hamas has an opportunity to act reasonably, to do what’s right and then to walk out,' he said. 'They’re not going to be a part of a government there.' U.S. officials have emphasized the need for Hamas to release American hostages, of which one is believed to be alive and another four dead, but Witkoff said that 'all lives matter' to the negotiators. 'We estimate 22, maybe 24 live bodies,' he said. 'We want them all back, and we want the bodies back, too. These parents, who know that their children are gone or their relatives are gone, they need those bodies. They need to go and bury their children properly.'

Israel is prepared to facilitate Gazan migration	Defense Minister Israel Katz has established a mechanism to assist 2,500 civilians daily in leaving Gaza. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel has completed preparations for the migration of civilians from Gaza; what remains is finding countries willing to take them in. Defense Minister Israel Katz has established a mechanism to assist 2,500 civilians daily in leaving Gaza. The current population of Gaza is approximately two million. The Ashdod Port is equipped to transport Gazans to other locations by sea, while Ramon Airport is ready to assist with air transportation. The aerial route through Ramon Airport has already been used to transport 1,500 injured Gaza residents to other countries. Another route for civilians to leave Gaza is through the Rafah crossing. It is estimated that 35,000 Gazans have already crossed through Rafah into Egypt since the start of the war. From there, many civilians seek residence in other countries. Since Israel is eager to facilitate the departure of as many Gazans as possible, family members of injured civilians are allowed to pass through. In many cases, these family members have expressed no intention of returning to Gaza. A security official stated, 'Our goal is to help as many people as possible leave, which aligns with the principles behind the Trump plan, supported by Israel. We are actively working to implement it.' The movement 'Reservists – Generation of Victory' has announced a voluntary emigration plan aimed at assisting the departure of 1.7 million Gazans via water, land, and air routes to Egypt, Libya, Gulf states, and other nations. The plan also includes housing assistance and cash grants for civilians emigrating from Gaza. Lt. Col. (Res.) Gilad Ach, chairman of the movement, stated, 'We are offering a comprehensive plan to eliminate the ongoing threat to Israeli civilians posed by the Gaza Strip. This is a unique opportunity to take advantage of the opening created by the current U.S. administration.' Israeli security sources have confirmed that one country had volunteered to accept Gazan construction workers but later canceled the offer due to international pressure.

Arab plan for Gaza a ‘welcomed effort,’ but not nature of what Tr...	Bruce said that the Arab plan for Gaza, which was released this week after a summit in Cairo, 'does not fulfill the requirements and nature of what President Trump was asking for, but it was a welcomed effort.' By Mike Wagenheim, JNS Hamas cannot continue to exist in Gaza 'with a gun, without a gun,' Tammy Bruce, the new U.S. State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday in her first press briefing. Until Hamas returns all the remaining hostages held in Gaza, 'there is no path forward,' Bruce said, calling it 'an impossible situation' with 'monsters, who are controlling and destroying Gazan lives and the lives of people around the region.' The Foggy Bottom spokeswoman’s comments come a day after U.S. President Donald Trump held an Oval Office meeting with a delegation of freed Israeli hostages. He vowed shortly after the meeting to destroy Hamas if it doesn’t immediately free the remaining captives. Bruce said that the Trump administration’s posture toward the region, including Trump’s controversial plan for a post-Hamas Gaza, is necessary. 'There’s been nothing new,' Bruce said of the stagnant politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 'It’s wash, rinse and repeat, back and forth for generations, and the approach now, in this dynamic, is that it has to be a new approach.' 'That is what President Trump has said from the beginning—that we’ve got to think differently about how things proceed in the region,' she said. New ideas have emerged, but 'one thing stays the same and is unmovable, and it is the existence of Hamas as a factor on the ground in that region will make it impossible to continue' with progress, Bruce said. Asked about Trump’s harsh Wednesday statement in light of the White House’s confirmation, hours earlier, that the United States engaged in unprecedented, direct negotiations with Hamas, Bruce said that Trump’s rhetoric didn’t change anything. 'There was no change of position. It was the conveyance of the existing American position about Hamas and how it cannot exist in Gaza,' she said. 'Whether it is through a tweet or a diplomatic cable or on television or through envoys or in a meeting, that message can be conveyed.' Bruce said that the Arab plan for Gaza, which was released this week after a summit in Cairo, 'does not fulfill the requirements and nature of what President Trump was asking for, but it was a welcomed effort.' She struck a note of optimism, stating that 'we have a very good chance at accomplishing' a successful outcome with the Arab leadership. 'We’ve articulated to leadership regarding what’s acceptable and what is not,' she said. 'So these conversations clearly will have to continue.' Moving across the region, Bruce said that the Trump administration is reviewing all existing sanctions waivers that provide Iran with 'any degree of economic or financial relief.' Washington is also urging the Iraqi government to end its reliance on Iranian energy sources, she said. Tammy Bruce, the U.S. State Department spokeswoman, holds a daily press briefing on March 6, 2025. Credit: Freddie Everett/U.S. State Department. Bruce was asked if a sanctions waiver, which allows Iraq to pay Iran for electricity and which expires this week, would be renewed. 'The Iraq sanctions waiver, as you’ve noted, for Iran gas imports expires on the 8th. We have, at this point as you might imagine, we have nothing to announce with regards to the current electricity waiver that expires on the 8th,' she said. 'In line with National Security Presidential Memorandum No. 2, we are reviewing all existing sanctions waivers that provide Iran any degree of economic or financial relief, and we are urging the Iraqi government to eliminate its dependence on Iranian sources of energy as soon as possible,' Bruce said. She added that Washington welcomes 'the Iraqi prime minister’s commitment to achieve energy independence. Hopefully, the United States is leading the way when it comes to that kind of an approach.'

US offers Hamas ceasefire extension in exchange for 10 hostages	This move by the U.S. marks a departure from the established policy of not negotiating directly with terrorist organizations. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In an unprecedented move, the U.S. has directly offered Hamas a two-month extension of the ceasefire in exchange for ten living hostages. The ceasefire also includes the opening of crossings for Gaza residents and the resumption of humanitarian aid deliveries. A Hamas source stated that it is currently studying the proposal. This move by the U.S. marks a departure from the established policy of not negotiating directly with terrorist organizations. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that U.S. officials are engaged in talks and negotiations with Hamas officials. U.S. Hostage Envoy Adam Boehler and Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff were involved in the discussions with the terrorist group. 'Dialogue and talking to people around the world to do what’s in the best interest of the American people is something that the president has proven he believes,' Leavitt said. Reuters reported Thursday afternoon that, while Israel is not directly involved in the Gaza talks, progress is being made toward advancing to the next phase of the hostage deal. The meeting, held overnight, included U.S. President Donald Trump’s Envoy for Hostage Affairs Adam Boehler, senior Hamas officials, and representatives from mediators Egypt and Qatar. The discussions focused on the future of the Gaza Strip and the potential governing body once the current conflict concludes. Ibrahim al-Madhoun, a commentator associated with Hamas, noted that the primary focus of the talks between the Hamas representatives and the U.S. envoy was on hostage Idan Alexander, who holds both Israeli and American citizenship. An Israeli official replied, stating, 'Israel is not aware of any progress toward Phase 2 [of the truce].' This marks the first time the U.S. has engaged in direct talks with Hamas, a group it designated as a terrorist organization 28 years ago, with no contact since. Israeli officials in Jerusalem expressed strong disapproval of these talks, although a statement released Wednesday sought to soften the reaction, noting, 'In discussions with the U.S., Israel conveyed its stance on direct talks with Hamas.'

By Daniel Greenfield, Frontpage Magazine The UN’s World Food Program, the biggest scam without ‘green’ or ‘crypto’ in its name, is at it again. The WFP has ceaselessly claimed that everyone in Gaza is starving to death for a year and a half now. Back in December, Cindy McCain, who heads it, demanded $17 billion to 'feed desperately hungry people.' Weeks after the brutal Hamas assault of Oct 7, Cindy McCain falsely claimed that Muslims in Gaza were 'literally starving to death as we speak'. In news that will startle everyone, the WFP is claiming once again that Gaza is about to run out of food. Maybe Cindy can visit Gaza and stop by some of these same supermarkets. USAID stole $2B from US taxpayers to send to Gaza to fight a famine that never existed. Now the media is complaining that DOGE cuts will hurt aid to Gaza.

The UN played a major role in faking this ‘famine’ by obstructing food deliveries so they could claim there was a famine. On Jan 2, for example, 189 trucks filled with aid entered Gaza. Only 147 trucks however were collected on the Gazan side with another 800 trucks worth of aid waiting to be collected. Food has been piling up and rotting on the Gaza side because it’s not being delivered by the UN. The Trump administration has allowed another $134 million in aid apparently as part of the disastrous Biden-Witkoff deal, but it’s shown much less willingness to entertain the lies. If Cindy McCain and the UN need to find food for Gazans so badly, they should visit some of these Gaza supermarkets and restaurants and ask them for donations.

Meet the Columbia radicals arrested for storming a Barnard buildi...	The radicals rushed in through a back exit that an accomplice held open, hoisted an effigy of Rosenbury, and passed out Hamas propaganda. They refused to leave, even after they were alerted of the bomb threat. By Jessica Costescu, The Washington Free Beacon Nearly half the radical activists arrested Wednesday after storming a Barnard College library are Columbia University students, a Washington Free Beacon review found. Of the nine individuals arrested after storming Millstein Library, four are Columbia students: Gabrielle Wimer, Hannah Puelle, Yunseo Chung, and Symmes Cannon. One, Tramy Dong, is a Barnard student. Another, Christopher Holmes, attends Union Theological Seminary, a Columbia affiliate, while the remaining three appear unassociated with either school. They were charged with disorderly conduct, trespassing, and obstructing governmental administration, according to an NYPD spokesman. Barnard president Laura Ann Rosenbury, however, stressed that the police weren’t called in because the radicals stormed Milstein Library. Rather, she felt the building needed to be cleared to protect the broader student body because of a bomb threat in the building. The radicals rushed in through a back exit that an accomplice held open, hoisted an effigy of Rosenbury, and passed out Hamas propaganda. They refused to leave, even after they were alerted of the bomb threat. Law enforcement eventually cleared the agitators from the library, but the protesters refused to clear the courtyard outside and clashed with police. Officers began making arrests. Wimer is a medical student at Columbia’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. According to screenshots of her LinkedIn that has since been deleted, she is 'passionate about global health and human rights' and has 'experience in research, program management, and community outreach in multicultural settings.' Wimer is the Class of 2025 president, the programming coordinator for Columbia’s Human Rights and Asylum Clinic, and an active member of Columbia’s chapters of White Coats for Black Lives and Students for a National Health Program, according to an online bio. Puelle is a Columbia senior studying philosophy and sociology. The Columbia Undergraduate Law Review website listed her as its publisher, but the page was removed Thursday afternoon. Puelle is also a research assistant at Columbia’s Labor Lab, according to her LinkedIn. A source familiar with Puelle said she was a resident adviser in the first-year residence dormitory John Jay Hall. She is also a member of Columbia’s Resident Advisers Collective Bargaining Committee, according to the Columbia Spectator. Hannah Puelle's LinkedIn photo. The third, Chung, is a Columbia junior pursuing her bachelor’s degree in English and Women’s and Gender Studies. According to a screenshot of her LinkedIn taken before it was deleted, she is involved in Columbia’s Criminal Justice Coalition and Columbia’s Queer Alliance and was the valedictorian of the high school she attended. A screenshot of Yunseo Chung's LinkedIn before it was deleted. Cannon is the deputy editor of Columbia Spectator’s weekly magazine, the Eye, but the page appears to have been removed. A screenshot of Symmes Cannon's page on the Columbia Spectator website before it was removed. Even though it was a Barnard building that was stormed, the focus will likely center more on Columbia because its students make up the bulk of those arrested. Since President Donald Trump took office, the university has taken a more aggressive posture toward its anti-Semitic students. In the past, however, it has been lenient. It dropped the vast majority of the suspensions leveled against students who participated in illegal anti-Israel protests last spring, for example. 'We have been notified that four Columbia students were arrested as part of yesterday’s disruption at Barnard’s Milstein Library and we are working swiftly through our discipline process. We regret that members of our community participated in this unacceptable disruption at Barnard,' a Columbia spokeswoman told the Free Beacon. 'Any violations of our rules, policies, and of the law must have consequences. We remain committed to supporting our Columbia student body of over 36,000 students and our greater campus community during this challenging time.' Columbia students Wimer, Puelle, Chung, and Cannon did not respond to requests for comment. The only Barnard student arrested, Dong, is a junior studying computer science. She was listed as a communications intern with the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a nonprofit organization working to 'fight against mass surveillance in New York and beyond'—the group’s intern page was removed Thursday afternoon. According to an online bio, which was also removed, Dong is 'interested in the intersection of technology and activism, hoping to learn more about surveillance systems and possible solutions.' According to her LinkedIn, she is part of Barnard’s Science Pathways Scholars Program, a 'highly selective four-year program that supports young students from low-income or first-generation households.' A screenshot of Tramy Dong's intern bio. Dong did not respond to a request for comment. Barnard’s vice president for development and alumnae relations Michael Farley, however, in a statement claimed that 'none of the individuals arrested on our campus Wednesday evening are Barnard students.' It is unclear if Dong was one of the two students the college expelled for storming an Israeli history class at Columbia in January and targeting Jewish students with anti-Semitic flyers. Barnard did not respond to a request for comment. The radicals stormed Barnard’s Milbank Hall last week to protest those expulsions. A third Barnard student was expelled soon after for storming a Columbia building last spring. The agitators behind Wednesday’s incident demanded the reversal of all three. A mob led by Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) and Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP)—the Ivy League institution's most anti-Semitic student groups—stormed Barnard’s Milbank Hall on Feb. 26, sending a security guard to the hospital and causing $30,000 in damages. CUAD and SJP also took credit for orchestrating Wednesday’s incident at the Milstein Library. Once inside, the agitators handed out Hamas propaganda justifying the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack. They demanded the immediate reversal of the Barnard students’ expulsions, 'amnesty for all students disciplined for pro-Palestine action,' and a complete 'abolition of the corrupt Barnard disciplinary process.' They also renamed the library after Hussam Abu Safiya, a Gaza hospital director the Israel Defense Forces accused of being a terrorist and holding a rank in Hamas. Even though the agitators voted to stay overnight, until Rosenbury returned to campus in the morning, a bomb threat reported in the building forced Barnard vice president for strategic communications Robin Levine to try to evacuate the library. She told students, 'You need to leave now, this is not a joke,' but the protesters refused to vacate the building, telling her, 'you're lying' and 'prove it.' NYPD Strategic Response Group officers were called to the scene and entered the occupied building, pushing most of the activists off campus. Those who resisted were among the nine arrested. Holmes is a 26-year-old graduate student at the Columbia affiliate college Union Theological Seminary. He was arrested twice at Columbia during last spring’s illegal pro-Hamas encampments, once on April 18 and again on April 30 over the violent occupation of Hamilton Hall and was charged with third degree criminal trespass. In September, Holmes was featured in a video posted to X where he called for 'the overthrow of the corporate totalitarian state.' The last individuals arrested are 21-year-old Pranavi Davuluri, a student worker at New York City’s School of Visual Arts, according to her LinkedIn, Alexander Nanci-Marr, 20, and Allison Wuu, 18. In a statement sent to the Barnard community, Rosenbury said that the decision to allow NYPD on campus was due to the bomb threat, not the occupation of the campus library. 'The safety of our campus, and every single person on our campus, must be protected above all else. The moment we received the bomb threat, we had to clear the Milstein Center and inform the authorities,' she said. 'The decision to request NYPD assistance was guided and informed entirely by the absolute obligation we have to keep every member of our community safe.'

Fatah leader: Israel abused Palestinians by demanding Shira Bibas...	The world must recognize the face of evil of the Palestinian Authority. By Itamar Marcus and Ephraim D. Tepler, Palestinian Media Watch What can you expect from a Fatah leader who celebrated October 7 because it 'made our heads touch the clouds'? First, Hamas murdered Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas as well as many other Israeli hostages. Then, it tried to trick Israel by not returning Shiri's body, proving that Israel must do careful forensic examinations on all bodies. Now, the terror-supporting Fatah leader is complaining that those forensic checks, necessary to confirm the identity of murdered Israeli hostages, abuse the Palestinian terrorist murderers because their release from prison may become delayed. Outrageously, he says that the parents waiting extra time for the released terrorists, many of whom by law should be remaining in prison for life, 'is a violation of the law, this is torture.' The world must recognize the face of evil of the Palestinian Authority. For PA/Fatah leaders, torturing and murdering Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir is not against the law, but delaying the release of murderers, whom Israel was forced to release in an extortion deal, is against the law. Fatah Secretary in The Hague Zaid Tyam: 'The occupation (i.e., Israel) checked the bodies and other things to drag its feet to abuse the Palestinian prisoners… The [Palestinian] families who stayed from Saturday until the following Saturday in some places waiting for their sons is a violation of the law, this is torture. Why don't people and the world talk about this issue?'

Palestinian Media Watch is certain that these are terror salaries because the PA postal service never made payments for the PA prior to April 2021. By Itamar Marcus and Ephraim D. Tepler, Palestinian Media Watch The Palestinian Authority announced that it is paying February's monthly 'allowances' today. Two similar announcements appeared with the PA Postal Service laconically announcing the payments in general and the 'PA employees' salaries' Telegram channel noting that these were the monthly payments for 'Martyrs, wounded, and prisoners': Palestine Post, Facebook page, March 5, 2025: 'Palestine Post announces the beginning of payment of the monetary allowances tomorrow morning, Thursday, March 6, 2025, at the main post offices and through the ATMs&#8230; The allowance payments in the Jenin and Tulkarem districts will be made through the nearest payment center in the other nearby districts due to the security situation.' 'PA employees' salaries', Telegram, March 5, 2025: 'Palestine Post: The payment of salaries to the families of the Martyrs, wounded, and prisoners begins on Thursday morning [March 6, 2025]. In Jenin and Tulkarem, the payment will be made through the nearest payment center in the adjacent other districts.' While the Palestine Post announcement did not mention for whom the payments were in particular, the employees' channel understood that these payments were for terrorists—the Pay-for-Slay payments that the PA had said it had stopped. Palestinian Media Watch is certain that these are terror salaries because the PA postal service never made payments for the PA prior to April 2021. The postal service started making payments only after PA banks closed 35,000 terrorist bank accounts, following PMW's warning to the banks that their continued acceptance of the PA terror rewards would constitute a violation of Israeli law and expose them to civil and criminal liability. 'The decision to pay the prisoners' salaries through the post office branches was… after the banks refused to accept the salary sheets of the prisoners and released prisoners due to the Israeli threats (i.e., PMW's warning letters) to harm and sue them.' [Ma'an, independent Palestinian news agency, April 5, 2021] From that first terror payment in April 2021 through August 2024, the PA postal service announcements explicitly said that the payments were for the 'Martyrs, prisoners and wounded,' just like the current post in the PA employees' salaries' Telegram group. After August 2024, the announcements became more general, possibly due to international condemnation when PMW exposed these continued payments. PMW has verified that the postal service made no announcements of any payments of any kind before April 5, 2021, the month the PA moved the terror salaries from the banks to the postal service. In other words, the only payments the postal service makes are terror rewards, which continued this month. The payments made by the PA postal services today are proof that the Pay-for-Slay payments to terrorists continue, despite Mahmoud Abbas' presidential decree changing certain structures, as anticipated by PMW.

Hamas forced dehydrated hostages to drink seawater	When drinks came, many received diluted seawater that damaged their teeth and gums while wreaking havoc on their immune systems. By Jewish Breaking News When Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami, and Or Levy were released from Hamas captivity last month, they appeared as shadows of themselves. After 491 days, their bodies told stories their lips might never fully express. Israeli health officials would later confirm that the brave heroes had lost as much as 40% of their body weight. 'Extreme malnutrition,' Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Medical Division for Israel’s Ministry of Health, tells the Jerusalem Post. Describing their condition as 'very concerning.' Dr. Mizrahi noted that they will require intense physical therapy to gradually rebuild lost muscle mass. According to others who made it out of Gaza alive, Hamas routinely turned starvation into a weapon causing their bodies to consuming themselves from the inside out. Aviva Siegel, freed during a brief ceasefire in November 2024, described how her captors would deliberately withhold all food for full days at a stretch. When drinks came, many received diluted seawater that damaged their teeth and gums while wreaking havoc on their immune systems. The sight of emaciated, traumatized, and physically broken hostages returning home has only deepened Israel’s collective anxiety about those left behind. Families of victims along with thousands of supporters gather at weekly rallies demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strike whatever deal necessary to bring them home. It is believed that 27 of the 63 hostages remaining are still living. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump met with former hostages in the Oval Office who shared personal accounts of their abuse. Sharabi presented Trump with a framed cartoon juxtaposing the Holocaust, titled 'Never Again,' with an image of himself in the hands of Hamas terrorists, titled 'Again.' Afterwards, Trump took to Truth Social to warn Hamas there would be 'hell to pay' if all the hostages were not released immediately. 'I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say,' he wrote. 'Release all of the hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you.'

Rubio launches AI-driven effort to revoke visas of Hamas supporte...	Under Trump’s executive orders, visa holders who threaten national security or promote extremist ideology are now facing deportation. By Jewish Breaking News Secretary of State Marco Rubio is spearheading an AI-powered 'Catch and Revoke' initiative to cancel visas of foreign nationals who express support for Hamas or other designated terrorist groups. The program includes AI-assisted reviews of tens of thousands of student visa holders’ social media accounts, particularly looking for terrorist sympathies expressed after Hamas’ October 7th attack on Israel. Officials are also reviewing arrest records, news reports on anti-Israel protests, and Jewish students’ lawsuits highlighting antisemitic activity. Federal agencies have examined 100,000 individuals in the Student Exchange Visitor System since October 2023 but found zero visa revocations during the Biden administration, which officials say reflects a 'blind eye' approach to enforcement. Under Trump’s executive orders, visa holders who threaten national security or promote extremist ideology are now facing deportation. Rubio, who pushed for visa revocations just days after October 7, has been vocal: 'We see people in our streets and universities calling for Intifada and celebrating Hamas. Those people need to go.' With Trump’s crackdown already in motion, officials report that many foreign students are now avoiding protests critical of Israel, fearing repercussions.

Defense Minister Katz tells IDF to seize protesters’ boats for re...	The announcement came in response to intelligence suggesting that protest groups were preparing renewed attempts to breach Jerusalem’s maritime blockade of the enclave. By JNS Israel Katz, Israel’s minister of defense, has instructed the Israel Defense Forces to refrain from blocking foreign pro-Palestinian protesters seeking to enter the Gaza Strip by sea, but seize their vessels, his office said on Thursday. According to Israel’s Channel 12, the announcement came in response to intelligence suggesting that protest groups were preparing renewed attempts to breach Jerusalem’s maritime blockade of the enclave. 'Whoever comes to demonstrate on the shores of Gaza, we will send them into Gaza and use the ships to evacuate Gaza residents who are interested in leaving voluntarily,' Katz said in the Thursday statement. His office added, 'The defense minister instructed the IDF to allow the protest flotillas to reach Gaza’s coast, disembark the protesters in Gaza, and seize the ships and transfer them to Ashdod Port so that they can be used to evacuate Gaza residents who are interested in leaving Gaza.' Israel in recent weeks has drawn up plans to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza in accordance with U.S. President Donald Trump’s Feb. 4 proposal to resettle the Strip’s population in Egypt, Jordan and other countries. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition—an umbrella group of global anti-Israel and Islamic NGOs—announced three months ago that, 'in 2025, we are determined to take to the seas to break the siege of Gaza' as it vowed to 'continue acquiring vessels and securing crew and participants.' The umbrella group includes several Turkish NGOs, among them the Humanitarian Relief Foundation and the Mavi Marmara Association, responsible for the 2010 Mavi Marmara incident, in which nine violent activists were killed by Israeli soldiers while attempting to reach Gaza. The deaths of the Turkish activists sparked a three-year diplomatic crisis with Ankara, which was resolved when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued an apology in 2013 over 'operational mistakes.'

Israel and other US allies reevaluate intelligence sharing as Tru...	Historically, Israel has emphasized operational security and has been reluctant to share sensitive intelligence even with close allies. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel and other US allies are reassessing the sharing of intelligence as the Trump administration fosters a warmer relationship with Russia. An NBC report, citing four anonymous sources familiar with the matter, said the allies were concerned that the identities of foreign assets could inadvertently be revealed. As a result, some spy agencies might withhold information from the US for fear it could be leaked to Russia. Although a senior Israeli official insisted that Israel's cooperation with the US remains 'as strong and solid as ever,' discussions are taking place within its security establishment on how to protect its most sensitive intelligence streams. Israel's security establishment is looking for ways to secure classified information shared between the two countries, particularly in efforts to combat counterterrorism and address regional threats. According to the report, Saudi Arabia and the Five Eyes, a spy alliance of English-speaking democracies, are considering rules of engagement with the US regarding intelligence sharing. Historically, Israel has emphasized operational security and has been reluctant to share sensitive intelligence even with close allies. There is concern that if Israel adjusts its current protocols for sharing intelligence with the US, the relationship between the two countries could suffer. Israel is likely to seek reassurance from Washington that information will be handled at the highest level of security. The New York Times reported last year that the Russian and Chinese governments are working behind the scenes to undermine international support for Israel and spread pro-Hamas propaganda. According to information provided by the Tel Aviv-based social media intelligence company Cyabra, the Times report states that Moscow and Beijing have aligned with Tehran in supporting Hamas following the terror organization’s October 7 massacres of Israelis, which left over 1,400 dead and more than 240 in captivity in the Gaza Strip. Since the invasion, China, Russia, and Iran have used their state-controlled media outlets to promote Hamas' claims that downplay or outright deny the terrorist organization’s atrocities, while accusing Israel of persecuting Palestinians and even committing genocide. Russia’s RT and Sputnik have both spread the false claim that Israel was responsible for bombing the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, despite evidence showing that the explosion, centered in the hospital’s parking lot, was caused by a misfired Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket.

New IDF Chief pens biblical letter showing Third Temple in visit ...	The closing line of the letter, 'From Zion, the Torah shall go forth,' invokes a prophetic hope that Jerusalem will once again be a source of wisdom and peace. By World Israel News Staff Israel's newly appointed IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, made a visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem, marking one of his first public acts after assuming his role. Accompanied by the outgoing Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Zamir participated in a ceremonial transition that underscored the continuity of leadership within the IDF during a time of heightened national responsibility. The Western Wall, a site of profound historical and spiritual resonance for the Jewish people, served as a fitting backdrop for Zamir to reflect on his new duties. Following tradition, he composed a note and placed it among the ancient stones, a gesture that blended personal prayer with a public statement of intent as he stepped into one of Israel’s most critical military positions. IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir's letter written at the Western Wall. (X Screenshot) The text of Zamir’s note, dated '5th of Adar 5785, March 5, 2025,' and written at the Western Wall—described as 'where the Temple once stood'—reveals a leader grounding his mission in both Jewish heritage and strong resolve. He began by acknowledging the site’s foundational role in Jewish identity, stating, 'At the Western Wall, where the Temple once stood, the foundations of the Jewish people were established.' Zamir then articulated a commitment to action, writing, 'We will act with determination and believe in our ability to defend the Land of Israel and protect Jews both in Israel and around the world.' This reflects Zamir's strategic priorities—safeguarding Israel’s sovereignty and extending protection to Jewish communities globally—while signaling a proactive stance amid ongoing regional tensions and increased antisemitism. Zamir’s note concluded with a heartfelt prayer and a biblical flourish, blending personal humility with a vision of moral clarity. He wrote, 'I pray for the hostages and for the safety of those who defend our nation—soldiers, security forces, and all who stand guard for Israel,' highlighting his immediate concerns, including the fate of hostages and the welfare of those under his command. The closing line, 'From Zion, the Torah shall go forth,' drawn from Isaiah 2:3, invokes a prophetic hope that Jerusalem will once again be a source of wisdom and peace. Signed as 'Major General Eyal Zamir,' the note encapsulates his role as a military leader rooted in Jewish tradition, offering a glimpse into how he intends to navigate the complexities of his tenure with faith, determination, and a deep sense of duty.

Trump promised to protect Jews and religious liberty, his refugee...	Iranian-American Jews who track Iranian media and stay in touch with relatives there say local Jews’ peril has grown, especially amid the war in Gaza that began when Hamas, which Iran backs, attacked Israel in October 2023. By Asaf Elia-Shalev, JTA When Haroun got the phone call he had been waiting on for almost 10 years, he told the caller to hang up. It was too risky for a Jew in Iran to take such a call — authorities could be monitoring his phone. 'Call me back on WhatsApp,' he said, putting faith in the messaging app’s promise of privacy and encryption. It was early last year and a representative from the refugee agency HIAS, formerly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, needed to tell Haroun that his turn had come. As long as Haroun passed an FBI background check, he’d soon be able to settle in the United States under a special program for persecuted religious minorities. The sudden news came thanks to a decision by the Biden administration to relaunch the so-called Lautenberg Program for Iranians; it had shut down when Donald Trump enacted a travel ban on a group of Muslim-majority countries at the start of his first term in office in 2017. Haroun was ecstatic. He had tried nearly everything in his quest to leave Iran and come to the United States, unsuccessfully applying for student and work visas. 'It was like seeing a miracle with your own eyes,' he said in a recent interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, recalling the moment HIAS called. 'You simply can’t believe what it felt like. All I’ve wanted is to practice my religion freely.' Haroun, who is in his early 30s, began making preparations in secret, telling almost no one about his plans. When applying for a passport, he lied, telling Iranian authorities he hoped to vacation abroad. They questioned him, but eventually approved his request, allowing him to leave as a tourist. Haroun made it into the United States, to settle in Los Angeles, in late December, and it was just in time. Three weeks later, on the day Trump returned to the White House, the new president signed an executive order indefinitely suspending the admission of refugees. The order closed the country to 700 Iranian Jews who had applied for refugee status through HIAS, including Haroun’s parents, siblings, and cousins. These Jews were among more than 13,000 applicants from other religious minorities in Iran, including Christians, Baha’is, Sabean-Mandaeans, and Zoroastrians. Independent information on the status of these groups is hard to come by, but they live under a host of legal restrictions that privilege Muslims. Haroun described a culture of fear gripping Iran’s Jewish community: 'Our kids know they are not allowed to talk about their religion to other people,' he said. Concern about the Jews of Iran spiked last year when authorities executed a young Jewish man who had been convicted of killing a man over money. Critics said the justice system had mishandled his case and that antisemitism played a role in his sentencing. Iranian-American Jews who track Iranian media and stay in touch with relatives there say local Jews’ peril has grown, especially amid the war in Gaza that began when Hamas, which Iran backs, attacked Israel in October 2023. Israel and Iran have since traded direct fire for the first time, with Iran sending hundreds of missiles toward Israel and Israel bombing military facilities in Iran, as well as assassinating Hamas’ political chief in Tehran. Elliot Benjamin, vice president of the Iranian American Jewish Federation, said Iranian officials have traditionally taken care, however disingenuously, to say they are opposed to Zionism but not to Jewish people. That distinction, he said, appears to be collapsing. 'In the past few months in comments by officials in the press, that line has not only been just blurry, it’s been completely crossed,' Benjamin, who is based in Los Angeles, said in an interview. 'Now, it’s Jews are Zionist. Zionists are Jews. They are one and the same.' Trump had said during his presidential campaign that he would end refugee resettlement on day one, so the executive order didn’t come as a surprise for HIAS. 'We knew this was coming, so we tried very hard to promote exceptions, particularly for Iranian religious minorities,' Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, said in an interview, recalling the period preceding Trump’s inauguration. 'We tried it through every channel we could. We reached out to people who had good relationships with the Trump team.' Based on the political views and pledges of Trump and his vice president, J.D. Vance, the possibility of an exception didn’t seem entirely outlandish. Their administration has said protecting Jews is a top priority and vowed to protect religious freedom around the world. Trump last month, for example, formed a federal task force to combat antisemitism. 'Antisemitism in any environment is repugnant to this Nation’s ideals,' the head of the task force, Leo Terrell, said in a statement. 'The [Justice] Department takes seriously our responsibility to eradicate this hatred wherever it is found.' Meanwhile, at the International Religious Freedom Summit last month, Vance spoke at length of Trump’s dedication to 'the cause of advancing religious freedom in his foreign policy.' 'Both at home and abroad, we have much more to do to more fully secure religious liberty for all people of faith,' Vance said. Iranian Americans have taken notice of how blocking the entry of persecuted religious minorities leaves some of the administration’s promises unfulfilled. 'Suspending or ending the Lautenberg Program is inconsistent with an administration that claims to be supportive of the Jewish community and supportive of Israel,' said Sam Yebri, a Los Angeles-based attorney and former candidate for the Los Angeles City Council, who was born in Iran. 'Being a friend to the Jewish community means more than standing up solely against Hamas or antisemitism at home. It means standing up for vulnerable Jews in Iran, in Venezuela, in Europe and throughout the world.' The State Department referred a request for comment to the White House, which did not respond to an inquiry. Besides Iranian minorities, other groups Trump’s executive orders keep out include Afghans who fought alongside American troops, Cubans and Ukrainian refugees, as well as asylum seekers at the southern border, reflecting a major break with the country’s historic embrace of refugee resettlement, born in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Trump has so far made one exception to his refugee ban. He signed an executive order last month that offered to take in as refugees white South Africans, citing alleged government-sponsored racial discrimination against them. Haroun is a pseudonym; fearing retaliation against his family, he agreed to speak to JTA anonymously because he wants Americans to understand how precarious life is for the estimated 8,500 Jews who live in Iran. 'In Iran, we are not even free to do simple things like put the kippah on our heads outside of our homes,' he said. 'We have to keep our religion a secret.' Haroun is disappointed his family can’t join him in the United States but he remains hopeful that Trump will change his policy. 'I’m alone here in the United States and my family is in a bad situation,' he said. 'I’m praying that maybe Donald Trump comes to understand the difference between Jews and minorities and everyone else in Iran. All Iranians are not the same.' The Iranian American Jewish Federation also is also calling for an exception for Iranian religious minorities. 'While we understand the need for the current immigration policies, we would welcome an exception for the persecuted Jews and other religious minorities in Iran to be able to partake of the refugee program,' Benjamin said. Originally serving to facilitate the immigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union, the Lautenberg Amendment was enacted in 1990 and sponsored by Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey. Hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking Jews took advantage of the program. Iranian religious minorities were added to the program in 2004 through an amendment sponsored by Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, allowing an estimated 19,000 to resettle in the United States. Historically, it was one of the surest paths to the United States. Applicants found an American sponsor, registered with HIAS, left their home and made it to a third country, usually Austria, where they awaited security vetting and additional processing before finally obtaining permission to immigrate. 'When they arrive in Vienna, they are basically assured of approval as long as they can establish that they are, in fact, members of those religious minorities,' Hetfield said. 'The program works very well: our approval rate is over 99%. There’s very little opportunity for fraud. A Jew is a Jew in Iran. The Mandaeans are as much an ethnic group, which cannot intermarry. The Christians that we assist are Armenian or Assyrian Christians. So they’re ethnic Christians, not converts. The Baha’i — we verify the membership of every single Baha’i in advance, so we’re able to ensure the integrity of the program.' The Lautenberg Amendment expires annually and Congress must act to reauthorize it, a reality that demands active lobbying by HIAS, especially in recent years. According to Hetfield, Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio and close Trump ally, has been skeptical about reauthorization. 'As chair of the Judiciary Committee, he merely has to object to it being included in the appropriation bill for it to be taken out,' Hetfield said. 'That almost happened last year.' The organization credited the insistence of Republican Rep. Kay Granger of Texas when the amendment overcame Jordan’s resistance. She retired last year amid health challenges that forced her to be mysteriously absent from Washington for months. Jordan’s spokesperson did not return a request for comment. 'We have to find another champion,' Hetfield said. The fate of the amendment, which is typically tacked onto one of the annual spending bills, hangs in the balance as the March 15 deadline to approve this year’s budget looms. The program ran relatively smoothly from its inception until near the end of President Barack Obama’s second term. So when Haroun applied in 2015, fresh out of high school, he expected to soon become an American, cherishing the dream of religious liberty. In late 2016, however, HIAS noticed that a group of Iranian refugees who had arrived in Austria were not getting processed. The refugee agency eventually learned that the FBI had changed its vetting process and neglected to inform the State Department, according to Hetfield. Before a bureaucratic fix could come, Trump entered the White House in 2017 and signed a series of executive orders barring the entry of people from a number of predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran. The refugees were stuck in Austria, which led to a diplomatic crisis, because the country had intended only to serve as a transit point. Austria was soon rocked by a major internal political crisis when a group of lawmakers were found to hold foreign citizenship, making them ineligible to serve in office. By the time the scandal settled down, it was early 2020 and the COVID pandemic forced a pause in global air travel. Only in 2023, after a six-year hiatus and tense international negotiations did the Lautenberg Program restart, albeit on a smaller scale, with a monthly quota of less than 150 people. Several dozen Iranian Lautenberg refugees settled in the United States in the period leading up to Trump’s second inauguration and his shutting down of all refugee programs. This group includes Haroun and as well as an 89-year-old Iranian Jew, who settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, reuniting with his niece. That decision, combined with Trump’s order to stop nearly all humanitarian assistance abroad, is forcing groups like HIAS to dramatically scale back life-saving operations, which for decades have relied on federal funding. Active since the 1880s, HIAS is the country’s oldest refugee aid group. Some 1.4 million refugees and displaced people receive aid such as meals, mental health treatment, and legal services from HIAS every year. It annually resettles thousands of refugees, mostly to the United States. The work has been enabled by an annual budget of $200 million, most of which has come from the federal government. HIAS is ramping up its philanthropic fundraising but doesn’t expect to make up for the disappearance of the government funding. 'Basically, it means a divorce from the U.S. government and their funding, because they’re not a trustworthy partner anymore,' Hetfield recently told Reuters. Joining two Christian refugee resettlement agencies, HIAS filed suit against the Trump administration over the freeze, citing a mandate rooted in the American Jewish experience and the community’s historic support for immigration. Many other Jewish advocacy groups are similarly kicking into high gear. 'The American Jewish community owes its very existence to those times when the United States opened its doors to refugees fleeing anti-Semitism and persecution,' Hetfield said at the time. 'The American Jewish community knows the heart of the refugees, for we were once refugees ourselves. Today, Trump has even slammed the door in the face of Christians, Jews and Baha’i fleeing Iran, as well as refugees from everywhere else.' Recent survey data tends to support Hetfield’s outlook. An estimated 78% of American Jews believe that the country’s 'openness to people from all over the world is essential to who we are as a nation,' compared to 69% among all U.S. adults, according to Pew’s new Religious Landscape Study. American Jews are also significantly more likely to say the country’s 'growing immigrant population' is 'a change for the better' than the average among all Americans, at 50% versus 35%. With American borders shut to them, the Jews of Iran can still find a haven by moving Israel, but many of the remaining ones are resistant to the idea, according to Benjamin. 'The current circumstances in Israel and the anti-Israel propaganda combined with the fact that many members of the community have relatives and friends in the United States, which they view as the land of opportunity, there is hesitation to make aliyah,' he said. For the 10 years he tried to leave Iran, Haroun could have escaped the country and moved to Israel, but he didn’t. He believes that doing so would make seeing his family again — by meeting, for example, in a third country — too risky. 'If Iranian intelligence finds out that I’m in Israel, my family will be in danger,' he said. 'They will kill my family.'

Israelis rescue 10 Indian workers kidnapped by Palestinians	The Palestinians attempted to use the workers' passports to cross into Israel, but Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint, suspicious of fraud, stopped them. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Ten Indian workers, kidnapped by Palestinians and held for a month in a village outside Jerusalem, were rescued by Israeli authorities, Israel's Population and Immigration Authority (PIIA) announced on Wednesday. The workers were lured to the village of al-Za'ayem with promises of construction jobs, only to be confined and robbed of their passports. The Palestinians attempted to use the workers' passports to cross into Israel, but Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint, suspicious of fraud, stopped them. The workers were rescued overnight in a joint operation involving the Population and Immigration Authority, the IDF, and the Justice Ministry. The workers were then moved to a secure location, and their employment status is still being determined. Around 16,000 Indian workers have arrived over the past year, with plans to recruit thousands more, according to AFP. While this effort has helped alleviate the labor shortage, it still doesn't fully replace the 80,000 Palestinians from Judea and Samaria who previously worked in the sector. This has led to slower construction and the risk of a housing shortage. Currently, around 30,000 foreign workers are employed, a significant decrease from pre-war levels. By late 2024, construction activity was approximately 25% below pre-conflict levels. Despite the growing number of Indian workers, they still do not meet the demand. Although there is no immediate housing shortage, delays in the delivery of new housing could arise. With Israel’s population growing at a rate of 2% annually, such delays may eventually cause shortages. Proposals to allow P.A. workers back into Jewish communities were met with widespread opposition. A survey conducted last year in Eli, a town of about 4,500 people in the Binyamin region of southern Samaria, revealed that 82% of residents opposed the idea, even with additional security measures in place. Two polls conducted last year found that around two-thirds of Palestinians in Judea and Samaria supported the October 7 attacks, during which approximately 6,000 Hamas-led terrorists breached the Gaza border, killed around 1,200 people, injured thousands more, and took over 250 hostages.

Hamas hostage taker who wrote for US-based website boasted of ‘ac...	Aljamal informed his hostages that 'Hamas was going to ensure that the United States, as well as Jews and Israelis, are hated everywhere,' according to the lawsuit. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon A Hamas operative who also wrote for a U.S.-based nonprofit publication bragged to his Israeli hostages about how the terror group 'was in contact and actively coordinating' with anti-Israel protesters at American colleges, according to eyewitness accounts detailed in a landmark terrorism lawsuit. Abdallah Aljamal, a Gaza-based 'journalist,' was killed last year during an Israeli raid that freed three hostages from his home: Almog Meir Jan, Shlomi Ziv, and Andrey Kozlov. They are now suing Aljamal’s former collaborator, a little-known publication called the Palestine Chronicle. The website is operated by a nonprofit group in Washington state, the People Media Project, thus giving it tax-exempt status. The lawsuit provides the hostages’ firsthand account of their time spent in captivity, where they witnessed Aljamal file dispatches for the Palestine Chronicle and brag about Hamas’s ability to orchestrate violent campus protests across America. It is one of several lawsuits stemming from Hamas’s Oct. 7 terror attack. The case is scheduled for trial early next year, according to lawyers working on the lawsuit. Aljamal, the lawsuit reveals, 'repeatedly expressed his hatred for the State of Israel and the United States of America and informed the [hostages] that Hamas was in contact and actively coordinating with its affiliates in the media and on college campuses.' While it has long been known that Hamas-linked entities are fueling the campus unrest, the hostage testimony confirms for the first time that the terror group itself is playing a role. Aljamal informed his hostages that 'Hamas was going to ensure that the United States, as well as Jews and Israelis, are hated everywhere,' according to the lawsuit. To achieve this goal, the terror group 'was coordinating with its allies, including its allies in the media and on college campuses, to foment hatred against Israel and Jews.' 'Most disturbingly,' the complaint continues, 'because of the Palestine Chronicle’s tax-exempt status, Hamas Operative Aljamal’s propaganda, as well as his hostage-taking, was actually subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.' Also named in the case is Ramzy Baroud, the Palestine Chronicle’s founder and editor-in-chief. Baroud, who formerly served as an editor and executive for Al Jazeera, the network bankrolled by Hamas-friendly Qatar, knowingly employed a Hamas foot soldier, the lawsuit alleges. Baroud also has written for two now-defunct websites that the U.S. government seized in 2020 for being part of a propaganda network controlled by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC), the Washington Free Beacon first reported in June 2024, shortly after Israel freed the three hostages. In addition to publishing Aljamal’s work, the Palestine Chronicle has favorably covered the campus protest movement in America. Baroud’s ties to Aljamal became the subject of a congressional investigation last year, with GOP lawmakers petitioning the IRS to revoke the People Media Project’s tax exempt status. The hostages’ lawsuit offers new details about the alleged relationship between Baroud and Aljamal. At 5:43 AM on Oct 7, 2023—about 45 minutes before Hamas breached Israeli territory—Aljamal posted a celebratory message on his TikTok account, suggesting he had advance knowledge of the strike: 'Praise be to God, abundant, good and blessed praise.. O God, guide us.. O God, guide us.. O God, guide us.. O God, grant us the victory that you promised.. O God, acceptance, acceptance, acceptance.. Your victory, O God.' Baroud, the lawsuit alleges, 'saw Aljamal’s post asking for a blessing over the terrorist attack.' In the weeks that followed, 'Aljamal's propaganda in the Palestine Chronicle increased exponentially, often publishing two to three pieces per day' as he kept the three Israelis captive in his Gaza home. Additional Facebook postings offered as evidence in the case show Aljamal’s young son wearing a Hamas headband and carrying a toy gun. Baroud and the Palestine Chronicle engaged in 'consistent, direct, and substantial contact with Aljamal, using electronic and internet means,' according to the complaint. Additionally, Baroud and the outlet 'knew that Aljamal’s post-October 7, 2023 propaganda could only be made with direct and substantial contacts with other Hamas terrorists providing him information to publish, power for his electronic devices, and Internet access for transmission of materials.' Baroud’s daughter, Zarefah Baroud, worked for American Muslims for Palestine, a leading anti-Israel group that has defended Hamas terrorism and spearheaded the anti-Semitic campus protests, as Aljamal held the hostages, the Free Beacon reported. The group is also being sued for providing 'substantial assistance to Hamas' in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks.

The research could lead to more accurate speech recognition systems, enhancing virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, as well as transcription tools. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli scientists unveiled research on how the brain processes speech and transforms sounds into conversation on Thursday with findings that could lead to new advancements in speech recognition technology, communication tools for people with speech disorders, and personalized assistive devices. By get insights into the neural pathways that allow people to speak and understand each other, scientists from Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Google Research, Princeton University’s Hasson Lab, the NYU Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center used electrocorticography (ECoG), a technique that records brain activity directly from the brain’s surface, to capture real-time data from participants during open-ended conversations. The data was analyzed using a speech-to-text model called Whisper, which breaks down language into three levels: sounds, speech patterns, and word meanings. Led by Dr. Ariel Goldstein of Hebrew University’s Department of Cognitive and Brain Sciences and published in the peer-reviewed Nature Human Behavior journal, the study offers a framework for studying how the brain processes speech in real-world conversations. The Whisper model predicted brain activity during conversation, even when applied to new data. It showed that different regions of the brain are activated at various stages of speech processing. For example, areas associated with hearing and speaking were aligned with the sounds and speech patterns of language, while regions responsible for higher-level understanding were connected to the meanings of words. This mapping of brain activity highlights how the brain supports communication. 'Our findings help us understand how the brain processes conversations in real-life settings. By connecting different layers of language, we’re uncovering the mechanics behind something we all do naturally—talking and understanding each other,' Goldstein said. 'Before we speak, our brain moves from thinking about words to forming sounds, while after we listen, it works backward to make sense of what was said,' he added. The research could lead to more accurate speech recognition systems, enhancing virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, as well as transcription tools. It also offers the hope of better communication aids for individuals with speech disorders, such as aphasia or dysarthria. The study could potentially lead to to brain-computer interfaces for people with severe speech disabilities. For people with hearing loss, speech impairments, or neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and Parkinson’s, the findings hold the potential of personalized assistive devices. The findings could also lead to more targeted therapies for people recovering from brain injuries or strokes who are trying to regain speech and comprehension abilities.

Since Hamas’s October 7 attack, Israeli forces have arrested 6,000 wanted Palestinians in counterterror operations in Judea and Samaria. By Ehud Amiton, TPS Israeli soldiers uncovered and destroyed a weapons depot and multiple improvised laboratories for explosives and drone production, the Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday. Troops found approximately 100 pipe bombs, eight larger bombs, and an explosive activation system. Several buildings used for terror infrastructure were demolished. The army launched an ongoing counterterror raid in the Jenin refugee camp on Jan. 19. It has since expanded to the Palestinian city Tulkarem and an area of Samaria known as 'the Five Villages.' The raids come on the heels of the Palestinian Authority’s failed crackdown in the Jenin refugee camp in January. Since Hamas’s October 7 attack, Israeli forces have arrested 6,000 wanted Palestinians in counterterror operations in Judea and Samaria. Around 40 percent were affiliated with Hamas.

US-Hamas truce talks advance—report	This marks the first time the U.S. has held direct talks with Hamas, which it designated as a terrorist organization 28 years ago, with no direct contact since then. By Shachar Kleiman, JNS With Israel not involved in the Gaza talks, at least not directly, Reuters reported on Thursday afternoon on progress in negotiations to move to the next phase of the hostage deal. The meeting took place overnight between U.S. President Donald Trump’s Envoy for Hostage Affairs Adam Boehler, senior Hamas officials and representatives of mediators Egypt and Qatar. The talks centered on the future of the Gaza Strip and the entity that would govern it once the current war ends. Ibrahim al-Madhoun, a commentator affiliated with Hamas, wrote that the conversation between representatives of the terrorist organization and the Trump administration’s envoy revolved primarily around hostage Idan Alexander, who holds both Israeli and American citizenship. Al-Madhoun noted that the terrorist organization has an opportunity to leverage the dialogue with the U.S. to present broader demands. He cited examples such as removing Hamas from the U.S. list of terrorist organizations, recognizing Hamas as part of a 'political solution' in the region, and ensuring that Hamas remains a key player in any future Palestinian state framework. This would be in addition to demands for negotiations on a long-term ceasefire. An Israeli official responded, saying, 'Israel is not aware of progress toward Phase 2 [of the truce].' This marks the first time the U.S. has held direct talks with Hamas, which it designated as a terrorist organization 28 years ago, with no direct contact since then. Israeli officials in Jerusalem expressed outrage over these talks, although the official statement released on Wednesday sought to soften the reaction, saying, 'In discussions with the U.S., Israel expressed its position on direct talks with Hamas.' As a reminder, Trump also met overnight with survivors of Gazan captivity, and at the end of the meeting issued a clear threat to Hamas: 'Release all of the hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,' the president stated. His message extended to Palestinian civilians as well, warning: 'Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!' Trump added that he intends to provide aid to Israel 'to finish the job; not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say. 'Only sick and twisted people would continue holding onto bodies, and you are sick and twisted people,' the American president wrote.

Abbey Gate attack mastermind extradited to face American justice	The attack was one of the deadliest days for American forces in Afghanistan in over a decade. By Jewish Breaking News Mohammad Sharifullah, the alleged ringleader in the deadly Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 American service members in Afghanistan, has been apprehended and extradited to the U.S. He arrived last night, where he will now face the consequences for his role in the attack. During his address to Congress last night, President Donald Trump announced his apprehension and that he is 'on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.' The bombing at Abbey Gate occurred on August 26, 2021, at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, as U.S. forces were overseeing evacuations amid the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. A suicide bomber, affiliated with ISIS-K, detonated an explosive vest packed with ball bearings, killing 13 U.S. troops and at least 170 Afghan civilians. The attack was one of the deadliest days for American forces in Afghanistan in over a decade. The fallen 13 were: • Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Darin T. Hoover, 31 • Marine Corps Sgt.

US imposes new sanctions on Houthis after redesignating Iran-back...	Trump’s order also calls for the destruction of the Houthis’ military capabilities and for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to inspect all partners and programs in Yemen to ensure funds do not reach the terrorist group. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner The United States has imposed sanctions on seven senior members of the Houthis, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday, one day after the Trump administration officially redesignated the Iran-backed rebels in Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO). The newly sanctioned individuals smuggled military-grade items and weapon systems into Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and negotiated buying weapons from Russia, according to the Treasury Department. Abdulwali Abdoh Hasan Al-Jabri and his company, Al-Jabri General Trading and Investment Co, were also designated for recruiting Yemenis to fight in Ukraine on behalf of Russia and raised money to support Houthi military operations. 'The US government is committed to holding the Houthis accountable for acquiring weapons and weapons components from suppliers in Russia, China, and Iran to threaten Red Sea security,' State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement. The latest sanctions came after the US State Department on Tuesday officially redesignated the Yemeni rebels as an FTO, following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump shortly after he took office. Trump’s executive order in late January followed repeated attacks by the Houthis, also known as Ansarallah, against Israel since October 2023, including the launch of over 200 missiles and 170 attack drones. 'The Houthis’ activities threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade,' the executive order reads.

'The Houthis, an Iranian proxy, unprovokedly launched hundreds of missile and drone attacks at Israeli citizens and communities, disrupted international shipping routes and upended global stability,' Sa’ar wrote. I commend the decision by @POTUS and @SecRubio to designate the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

Trump’s order also calls for the destruction of the Houthis’ military capabilities and for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to inspect all partners and programs in Yemen to ensure funds do not reach the terrorist group. Additionally, the US announced a reward offer of up to $15 million and possible re-location for information leading to the disruption of the Yemeni group’s financial mechanisms. 'Since 2023, the Houthis have launched hundreds of attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, as well as US service members defending freedom of navigation and our regional partners,' Rubio said in a statement. 'Most recently, the Houthis spared Chinese-flagged ships while targeting American and allied vessels.' The FTO designation makes non-citizen members and representatives of the Houthis eligible for deportation and requires any US financial institution with ties to the group to report to the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the US Treasury Department. Since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023, the Houthis — whose slogan is 'death to America, death to Israel, curse the Jews, and victory to Islam' — have targeted over 100 merchant vessels in the Red Sea. They asserted that these attacks and disruption of global trade were a show of support for Palestinians in Gaza following Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. In January, the group signaled it would limit its attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships after a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip but warned that broader assaults could resume if necessary. Reports have indicated that the Houthis used Iranian-supplied ballistic and cruise missiles to carry out these attacks. In 2021, the Biden administration reversed Trump’s previous decision to designate the Houthis as an FTO, citing a desire to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Yemen. In his statement, Rubio stated that this concern over humanitarian aid is no longer an issue, saying that the US would no longer 'tolerate any country engaging with terrorist organizations like the Houthis in the name of practicing legitimate international business.' Several countries — including Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Israel — currently designate the Houthis as terrorists. Last month, the United Nations announced it suspended its humanitarian operations in areas controlled by Houthi rebels, after they detained dozens of UN staffers, who remain unreleased. The Houthis have been waging an insurgency in Yemen for two decades in a bid to overthrow the Yemeni government.

Israel taking charge of all aid delivery to Gaza – report	The report comes as France, Germany and Great Britain accuse Israel of violating its international obligations by stopping the entry of all aid on Sunday. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel is going to take charge of all aid delivery to the Gaza Strip, The Washington Post reported Thursday, after days of the Jewish state coming under fire from Europe, the Arab world and the UN for 'violating international law' by stopping the aid flow Sunday. Only one entry point will be allowed, at the Kerem Shalom crossing into southern Gaza, the report said, citing 'officials from five major aid organizations and the United Nations' who had been 'informed of the plan by Israeli authorities.' All goods will be checked first, and a tracking system will be established to ensure that the supplies reach their intended destinations, which will be logistical 'hubs' that Israel will set up in the Strip. Security and other personnel involved in the process would also be vetted by Israel, to prevent the infiltration of criminal elements or Hamas members who could divert the shipments, which has often been the case until now, according to the IDF. Israel has been fiercely criticized for freezing the entry of aid since Phase 1 of the hostage deal ended Sunday and Hamas refused to accept the U.S. proposal in which the ceasefire would be extended through April 19, with half the hostages freed on the first day and the other half on the last day. Many Arab states and the UN immediately condemned the stoppage, calling it a violation of international law, with the Saudi foreign ministry accusing Israel of using it 'as a tool of blackmail and collective punishment.' On Wednesday, France, Germany and Great Britain joined the chorus, saying in a joint statement, 'We call on the government of Israel to abide by its international obligations to ensure full, rapid, safe and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance to the population in Gaza.' 'Humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or used as a political tool,' the three countries’ foreign ministers said, describing the situation in the coastal enclave as 'catastrophic.' Somewhat softening the Arab and UN language, the statement added that halting flow of goods 'would risk violating international humanitarian law.' The Israeli Foreign Ministry hit back on X Thursday, noting there is no issue of starvation in Gaza and that Hamas has used aid to rebuild. 'There is no shortage of essential products in the Strip whatsoever,' it posted. 'The only humanitarian suffering in Gaza is that of the Israeli hostages, who are being chained, starved, and held in Hamas’ tunnels.' Statistics kept by Jerusalem reveal that over the 42 days of the ceasefire, the Gazans have received 25,200 truckloads of food, water, medicine and medical equipment, and over half a million tents, while 2,100 fuel and gas tankers have entered the coastal enclave. According to Israeli estimates, the terrorist organization thus has enough supplies for at least four months. 'Aid that goes to Hamas is not humanitarian,' the Foreign Ministry added. 'Enabling the enemy to resupply itself so it can regroup and attack you again is not humanitarian – it is suicidal and will not be allowed.' Israel said months ago that Hamas has also earned at least half a billion dollars from selling the humanitarian aid its men have stolen throughout the war, giving them the money to pay their members, recruit new fighters, and get weapons.

Ben Gurion Airport’s terminal one to reopen in time for post-war ...	According to IAA data, more than 1,377 flights are expected to depart from Terminal 1 in April, accounting for roughly a quarter of all outbound passengers at Ben Gurion. By Pesach Benson, TPS Expecting a post-war surge in travel, Ben Gurion Airport’s Terminal One will resume operations during the last week of March, the Israel Airports Authority announced on Wednesday. The terminal was closed in the aftermath of the October 7 attacks as international airlines suspended their flights to Tel Aviv. The terminal initially reopened in June 2024, but the Airport Authority subsequently closed it in November to make renovations. The reopening comes as international airlines gradually resume flights to Israel for the first time since the October 7 war, with passenger traffic expected to surge ahead of the busy holiday season. Domestic flights will return to the terminal in the last week of March, with international operations resuming at the end of the month. According to IAA data, more than 1,377 flights are expected to depart from Terminal 1 in April, accounting for roughly a quarter of all outbound passengers at Ben Gurion. Airlines operating from the terminal will include El Al, Arkia, Israir, Wizz Air, Ryanair, and EasyJet. Wizz Air is set to operate approximately 110 weekly flights to 19 destinations, while Ryanair will offer 86 weekly flights to 22 locations. EasyJet is expected to resume flights to Israel in June. Passengers flying from Terminal 1 will have direct access to a range of popular destinations, including Sofia, Budapest, Berlin, Rome, Athens, and Vienna. With the reopening of the terminal and increased passenger traffic expected ahead of Passover, the IAA has expanded its workforce, hiring dozens of security and operations employees. Several major airlines are resuming service to Israel after a hiatus. United Airlines and Delta will restart flights in March and April, respectively, while British Airways resumes on April 5 with one daily flight, increasing to two on April 20. Other airlines returning include Air India, Air Baltic, Iberia Express, and Hainan Airlines. And the Lufthansa Group announced an increase in weekly flights to Israel, rising from 35 to 60, with added overnight routes to connect Israeli passengers to North America via Europe.

Hamas prisoner deal to be paid in future dead, warns terror victi...	If we respond late, or give in to demands, then Hamas, [now slain Hamas head] Yahya Sinwar, and the other released terrorists become leaders, and the evil committed in the next round rises geometrically, multiplying many times more.' By David Isaac, JNS IDF Lt. Col. (res.) Meir Indor has waged an uphill battle against mass terrorist releases by Israel since 1986, when he founded the Almagor Terror Victims Association. His latest effort was against the current deal, which saw some 1,900 terrorists, including hardened killers and 274 serving life sentences, released in exchange for 33 Israelis, some of whom were no longer alive. Indor knows something about fighting terrorism. As an IDF soldier, he was a member of the first unit of mista’arvim, Israeli combat teams that disguise themselves as Arabs to operate undercover within Palestinian populations. As a civilian, he became an activist in the wake of the Jibril Agreement, a prisoner exchange deal that took place on May 21, 1985. That deal marked the first mass prisoner release by Israel, in which 1,150 security prisoners were exchanged for three Israelis captured during the First Lebanon War. Those terrorists would become the leaders of the First Intifada, which broke out less than three years later. JNS spoke with Indor about the dangers of Israel’s approach to hostage agreements. JNS: How many terrorists who have been released from Israeli jails return to terrorism? Indor: We don’t have an organized tracking system. The Almagor Terror Victims Association is a voluntary body. Our dream is to establish a research division. But we occasionally receive different numbers from security agencies. There is a report that approximately 80% of released terrorists return to carry out more terror. Returning to terror, it’s worth noting, doesn’t always mean the terrorist commits the actual terrorist act. A recidivist isn’t necessarily the one who sticks the knife in your back. A former terrorist lecturing others and inspiring them is also a recidivist. For example, he could become a hero to his neighborhood, indoctrinating youth to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the cause. I’m thinking here of a specific example. A terrorist murdered a young couple, Revital Seri and Ron Levy, as they were hiking by the Cremisan Monastery near Jerusalem’s Gilo neighborhood [in October, 1984]. The murderer lectures to various groups that arrive in Bethlehem or the nearby refugee camp. He lectures about what he did. I know that he also cultivates young people to volunteer for [terrorist] actions, even if he is himself careful not to return to terrorism fully. If challenged, he’ll say it’s freedom of speech. In the end, the ones who pay for this are those who are next in line to be murdered. Q: Would a death penalty for those responsible for murdering Israeli citizens help with this problem? It would eliminate the most dangerous terrorists. A: A death penalty is really essential in Israel, both morally and practically. Another option is a delayed death penalty. What this means is that the terrorist would be condemned to death and placed in prison with that death sentence hanging over him. The moment there’s a kidnapping, the sentence would be carried out. The kidnapping thus becomes the trigger to execute judgment. The condemned terrorist will be brought forward and killed. This would cause potential murderers to think twice, knowing that their action would cause one of their buddies to be killed. However, it’s far more efficient, moral and cheaper to kill them. It costs a lot of money to keep them in prison. And their confinement leads their friends to kidnap Israelis as a way to set imprisoned terrorists free. Q: Why did every section of Israel’s security establishment support this latest deal? A: Our IDF and intelligence officers go to university for two years, here in Israel and in the United States, from Berkeley to Boston to New York, where they encounter a progressive-liberal stream of thought. It’s like a new religion. Commanders also study at American military schools where they’re taught the concept of low-intensity conflict—the idea that warfighting must be kept to a minimum because you can never achieve victory, which by the way isn’t true. What about World War II? So after this 'education,' the officer comes back to the army with his new ideas about combat. Only now he returns with a rank of colonel. He’s no longer a young combat officer. He’s a 'thinking man.' And he has adopted the paradigm of 'low-intensity conflict.' It’s from the American system, but it’s our problem. Most of the defense establishment is one-dimensional in that they all think in Western terms. They can be good officers at lower ranks, but as generals, they are like those in the United States, who actually fail in war. All of this is a foreword to say that part of the DNA of their thinking is you can’t win, and this is coupled with the mantra from the Western universities and from global supporters of the terrorist cause, as well as the political left in Israel, that we need to build a Palestinian state. There is also the issue of the left wanting to control Israel at all costs. If you’re on the right, and you say releasing terrorists is a bad idea, they say, 'We’re on the Left. We believe the opposite. Our way is the way to peace.' Q: Are the costs of these deals higher than people realize? It’s not only the numbers killed, or that much of the Oct. 7 Hamas command structure were terrorists freed in the 2011 Shalit deal, but the attack unleashed a wave of global antisemitism culminating in Israel facing genocide charges in an international court. A: What you say is correct. However, I would like to put it in moral terms. When you surrender to evil, evil learns that terrorism pays. Evil builds on weakness to create still more evil. If you want the world to be peaceful, stop the bastards at the start. Don’t let them run riot in the neighborhood. If we respond late, or give in to demands, then Hamas, [now slain Hamas head] Yahya Sinwar, and the other released terrorists become leaders, and the evil committed in the next round rises geometrically, multiplying many times more. Q: How do you explain that Israel repeats these deals, given the extremely high costs? A: Media influence. The predominately leftist press is a great danger to the State of Israel. For example, the media in Israel has become obsessively anti-Bibi even though the large majority of Israelis voted for him to be prime minister in democratic elections. They’ve distanced themselves from all respect for true democracy and replaced it with all kinds of ideas learned in the Western world, similar to the radical liberal philosophies which we mentioned regarding the IDF leadership. Some of these ideas include striving to understand the criminal, his upbringing and his society; that we should educate him and not punish him. That you should feel guilty for having power over the other, for ruling over minorities. The media here moved to the radical liberal side. It really isn’t liberal at all. A sociologist needs to come up with another name. It’s giving into tyranny under a cover of liberalism. As to how to fight this consciousness engineering by the media, I don’t have an answer. Q: Is that why the public supports these deals? A: The Israeli public does not support these deals. Most of the public does not work in the media. Most of the Israeli people are traditional. They cherish the values of true Torah Judaism. They vote for parties on the right. They are the majority. Q: What role do the protests by the hostages’ families have in this? A: A huge influence. The families are manipulated by the barons of the left. The question is: Where is all their campaign money coming from? I run an organization. I know the costs. We never came close to the dimensions of the current release-the-hostages/anti-government campaign. We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in a year and a half. It is clear to me that the money did not come from Israel. Israeli philanthropists don’t donate that kind of money. I received a tip from an ex-Mossad agent who says it’s Qatar. He said it’s a ‘black operation.’ It’s illegal. It’s a method of overthrowing a government not to the liking of what is called the deep state. Supported by behind-the-scenes billionaires, anti-Israel governments look for the internal enemies of the current Israeli administration and then sends those groups money. Qatar wouldn’t send it directly. It would go through organizations in Europe and elsewhere. They act as proxies. If I were, say, from the Fatah organization and supported by a Muslim government awash in cash, I wouldn’t suggest sending the money straight to me. I would say to them, 'Israeli society is very open and it is very divided. Go and fund a campaign that will further split its society and bring down the rightist government.' Q: There was an anti-[Prime Minister Benjamin]Netanyahu campaign, 'You’re the leader. You’re guilty.' The group behind it is called Lochmei Kippur 73, or 'Yom Kippur 73 Veterans.' They had ads pointing out that Netanyahu released Yahya Sinwar in the Shalit deal. But these same people demand a deal to release the hostages. Wouldn’t intellectual consistency demand they oppose another Shalit-type deal? A: Those are a bunch of deep state experts in mass psychology. Each time, they wear a new costume. Regarding their campaign where they blame Netanyahu for the release of Sinwar, they themselves were the same people who demanded that Gilad Shalit be released at all costs, even in exchange for 1,000 imprisoned terrorists. You have to ask who organized the demonstrations pushing for the Shalit deal that led to Sinwar’s release? They did. The same people. The same strategic advisers, including Ronen Tzur [former head of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the main group now demanding a hostage deal]. He brought in Shalit’s father to a large demonstration. Netanyahu thought, and it was his mistake, that maybe the government really was is in danger of falling. So he tossed them a deal. He gave them the boy. By the way, for him [Netanyahu] it worked. At least temporarily. They stopped the demonstrations. But now, it has all returned to haunt him. The rulers of the left in Israel aren’t interested in morality. They seek one thing alone—power to rule over the country and to turn Israel into a woke state amongst the nations of the West.

New IDF chief – Defeating the enemy is our mission	Sources say Lieut. Gen. Eyal Zamir is planning to be more aggressive against Hamas and hold territory captured in Gaza if the war resumes. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The new IDF chief of staff plans to be more aggressive against Hamas than his predecessor if the war in Gaza resumes, security sources told Walla Wednesday. Instead of the policy of clearing out terrorists from an area and then leaving, only to need to return as Hamas forces regroup, which occurred repeatedly in several places in Gaza over 15 months of war, Lieut. Gen. Eyal Zamir intends to use massive force to overwhelm the enemy, and then stay. The ground maneuver would consist of several divisions entering at once, accompanied by immense fire from both the air and the ground, the sources said. The IDF would then occupy the territory it seized, both to ensure that it remains terrorist-free and to exert pressure on Hamas to make a deal and release the 59 remaining hostages, 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. The policy of allowing Gazan civilians to leave war zones via humanitarian corridors before they are attacked would continue, the media site noted. In his first IDF-wide order Wednesday, after acknowledging the army’s failure to protect the country on October 7, 2023, Zamir was very clear on the direction he would take. 'From here on, we turn in one direction – victory and defeating the enemy!' he wrote. 'We will not return until they have been destroyed.' While saying that the soldiers 'have made great achievements,' he noted that he would make more demands on them as 'there are still many challenges before us,' but also vowed, 'I will provide you with the tools to win.' The Trump administration has already given Israel the armaments it had paid for that former president Joe Biden had halted in his concern over civilian casualties in Gaza, and Secretary of State Mark Rubio announced Saturday night that the White House had authorized $4 billion worth of war materiel, including tens of thousands of bombs, to be sent to Israel immediately. This is part of a nearly $12 billion arms deal that Jerusalem has worked out with Washington, which will be delivered as they come off the production line over the next few years. Hours after his promotion ceremony Wednesday, Zamir also emphasized the importance of the value of 'victory' in battle to the IDF high command, in contrast to the policy of deterrence that had been the army’s mantra for over a decade. This will require more personnel as well as more weapons, and on his first night on the job, Zamir ordered the re-establishment of three reconnaissance companies in the Armored Brigades that had been disbanded several years ago, the formation of an additional tank brigade, and to consider establishing a new infantry brigade as well. He announced that in June his staff will begin working on a new multi-year plan for the IDF’s future, which will take several months to prepare. In parallel, he appointed Maj. Gen. (res.) Sami Turgeman to head a team to draw lessons from the army's investigations into October 7, and plan how to implement them going forward. Zamir also announced two immediate senior appointments. Former head of the Personnel Directorate Maj. Gen. Yaniv Asor will be the new head of Southern Command instead of Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, who had announced his resignation from the IDF in January over the failure to protect his area of command on October 7. Brig. Gen. Itzik Cohen, the commander of the 162nd Division which saw 500 days of action in Gaza, will be promoted and appointed as the next head of the Operations Directorate, replacing Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk, who is also resigning.

Report: Trump to apply ‘Gaza plan’ to Judea and Samaria	In early February, Trump hinted that annexation of Judea and Samaria was on the agenda. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration may recognize Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, while encouraging Palestinians in that region to emigrate to nearby Arab countries, echoing the terms of the Gaza plan. Under President Donald Trump's plan for Gaza, Palestinians will leave the Strip and resettle in third countries, while the coastal enclave is rehabilitated and reconstructed following the destruction of the October 7th war. According to a report by the Open Source Intel account on X, a senior Trump administration official has signaled that the U.S. will permit Israel to officially annex Judea and Samaria. JUST IN Senior U.S. official: The Trump administration is considering allowing Israel to extend sovereignty over Judea and Samaria and is not ruling out applying the 'Gaza Plan' there as well. U.S. discussions include proposals to transform parts of the region into a joint… pic.twitter.com/gULIRvv4Ct &mdash; Open Source Intel (@Osint613) March 5, 2025 'U.S. discussions include proposals to transform parts of the region into a joint American-Israeli project, while promoting Palestinian emigration to [the] Sinai [Peninsula in Egypt] and Jordan,' the report stated. The account did not include any sources for the information, nor confirmation from Israeli or American officials that the discussions took place. In early February, Trump hinted that annexation of Judea and Samaria was on the agenda when asked about the prospect by a reporter. 'We're discussing that with many of your representatives. You're represented very well,' Trump said when asked by an Israeli reporter if he was in favor of 'Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.' Trump added that 'people do like the idea, but we haven't taken a position on it yet. We'll be making an announcement probably on that very specific topic over the next four weeks.' In January, Yesha Council chairman Israel Ganz told the Jerusalem Post that annexation of Judea and Samaria was 'on the table,' but added that it would 'take time' to come to fruition. Notably, the Israeli government has reportedly held off on annexation on a previous occasion, in order to secure the Abraham Accords peace agreements. Its unclear if potential normalization with Saudi Arabia could impact Israel moving forward with officially applying sovereignty to Judea and Samaria.

Israel doesn’t mind US direct talks with Hamas, says Israel offic...	The NY consul-general praised the White House‘s pressure on the terrorists instead of on Israel. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Responding to the Wednesday revelation that the United States has been conducting quiet negotiations with Hamas, New York Consul-General Ofir Akunis told Fox News on Wednesday that Israel does not mind at all. 'If the White House wants to talk directly to Hamas and put them under pressure to release more hostages, we will be very happy to see more hostages with their families and in Israel,' he told Stuart Varney on the Varney and Co. show. Such a scenario is 'more than welcome,' he added. Akunis believes that the talks are part of a fresh approach being taken by the new administration to the Gazan war in general and its terrorist rulers in particular, which is much appreciated by Israel. 'I can tell you that there’s a new attitude from the White House&#8230; against Hamas,' he said. 'I think that the main thing is that President Trump actually changed the whole idea,' he noted. 'Instead of putting Israel under pressure, President Trump is putting Hamas under pressure, and this is the right thing to do. The proof is that we signed the new hostage deal even before January 20th [Inauguration Day].' This is the first known time that an American administration is directly talks with Hamas, a group that the U.S. officially designated as a terrorist organization in 1997. U.S. Envoy for Hostages Adam Boehler has been holding the discussions in Qatar over the last few weeks. He is reportedly most interested in the release of the five Israeli-Americans Hamas is still holding, only one of whom is believed to be alive - Edan Alexander, an IDF soldier. Two other soldiers, Omer Neutra and Itay Chen, were killed while fighting the terrorists who broke through the border on October 7, 2023. Gadi and Judith Weinstein Haggai were murdered during the takeover of Kibbutz Nir Oz. The bodies of all four were taken into Gaza that day to be used as bargaining chips. According to Walla, the talks are also addressing a broader deal to free all 59 remaining hostages, 35 of whom are already known to be dead, and reach a long-term truce between Israel and Hamas. White House Press Aecretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed at a press briefing Wednesday that 'the special envoy who’s engaged in this negotiation does have the authority to talk to anyone.' 'We have consulted with Israel regarding the negotiations with Hamas,' she added. 'The president believes that this is an attempt to do what is right for the American people.' She refused to provide any details on the content of the negotiations because they were 'still ongoing' and 'American lives are at stake.' Citing a 'source familiar with the details,' The Jerusalem Post reported that 'the key message during these meetings &#8230; was: ‘Trump expects to see actions before discussing the next phase.’' After meeting with seven former hostages at the White House on Wednesday, the president presented at least one action he is now looking for, posting to X and his Truth Social platform that Hamas should immediately release all the hostages, both living and dead, 'or it is OVER for you,' adding, 'I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job.'

These are the 5 American-Israeli hostages still held by Hamas	Five hostages with American citizenship are still held in Gaza, with only one of them believed to still be alive. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration engaged in unprecedented direct talks with Hamas, with President Donald Trump stressing that they must release all the hostages or 'it will be all over' for the terror group. Trump appears to be particularly focused on securing the release of five hostages who hold both American and Israeli citizenship, who remain in Hamas captivity. Here is a closer look at the American national still held in the Strip, more than 16 months after the Hamas terror onslaught on October 7th, 2023. Edan Alexander Raised in New Jersey, Edan Alexander is the sole American hostage believed to still be alive. Alexander, an active-duty soldier in the Golani Brigade, was kidnapped from his army base adjacent to the Gaza Strip. He was last seen in a November 2024 Hamas propaganda video. Omer Neutra Omer Neutra, an Israeli soldier from Long Island, New York, was kidnapped from his tank. His family was initially informed that he was kidnapped alive, but forensic analysis later revealed that he was killed on October 7th. His parents, Ronen and Orna, spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2024, calling for the release of the hostages. Judi Weinstein-Haggai and Gadi Haggai Holding both American and Canadian citizenship, New York native Judith (Judi) Weinstein-Haggai immigrated to Israel decades ago. She was murdered alongside her Israeli-born husband, Gadi Haggai, as they went for a Saturday morning walk in their kibbutz, Nir Oz. Their bodies were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip. Itai Chen Born in Israel to a father originally from New York, IDF soldier Itai Chen was kidnapped from a tank during the October 7th attacks. Chen was originally said to be missing in action, but the authorities later told his family that he was killed during the onslaught. Chen also held German citizenship via his Israel-born mother, Chagit. In February, Sagui Dekel-Chen, an Israeli with American citizenship through his Connecticut-born father, and Keith Siegel, an American who immigrated to Israel in the 1870s, were released from captivity as part of the ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal. According to a statement from former Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, more than 40 people with American citizenship were murdered on October 7th.

I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job&#8230; not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say,' warned Trump. Former President Donald Trump delivered a strong warning to Hamas in a Truth Social post on Wednesday, demanding the immediate release of all hostages. Trump’s message followed a meeting with several former Hamas hostages who had traveled to Washington, D.C., to share their experiences. Among those present were Eli Sharabi, Doron Steinbrecher, Keith Siegel, Aviva Siegel, Naama Levy, Omer Shem Tov, Iair Horn, and Noa Argamani, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. In his post, Trump began by addressing Hamas directly: '‘Shalom Hamas’ means Hello and Goodbye - You can choose.' He then issued a stark ultimatum: 'Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you.' The former president did not hold back, condemning the group’s actions. 'Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!' He went on to pledge support for Israel, stating, 'I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job,' and warning Hamas that 'not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say.' Referencing his recent meeting with former hostages, Trump made it clear he would not tolerate further delay. 'I have just met with your former Hostages whose lives you have destroyed,' he wrote. 'This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance.' Turning his attention to civilians in Gaza, Trump urged them to take action. 'Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!' Trump’s post received backing from an unexpected political figure—Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania known for his strong support of Israel. Fetterman echoed Trump’s call for action, posting on X, 'Free all the hostages or start killing Hamas members again. I fully agree with @POTUS.' Trump’s forceful stance came just hours after the White House faced scrutiny over its approach to negotiations with Hamas. During a press briefing, Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy pressed the administration on its stance. 'If the U.S. has a long-standing policy that we do not negotiate with terrorists, then why is the U.S. now negotiating directly and for the first time ever with Hamas?' Doocy asked. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the administration’s approach. 'Well, when it comes to the negotiations that you're referring to, first of all, the special envoy who's engaged in these negotiations does have the authority to talk to anyone,' she responded. Leavitt also emphasized that Israel was kept informed throughout the process. She stated that Trump’s administration believed in 'good-faith effort[s] to do what's right for the American people,' but declined to disclose further details, adding, 'These are ongoing talks and discussions. I'm not going to detail them here. There are American lives at stake.'

‘Ugly, politicized power’ – Coalition moves to oust Attorney Gene...	The attorney general unlawfully turned herself into a veto power of the legislative branch against dozens of bills ministers have sought to advance,' wrote Justice Minister Yariv Levin. By World Israel News Staff Justice Minister Yariv Levin filed a motion on Wednesday to begin the process of dismissing Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, after months of tensions between the coalition and its advisory lawyer. Levin initiated the lengthy bureaucratic procedures to fire Baharav-Miara, which will likely take months, by asking the cabinet secretary to set a date for a hearing regarding her dismissal. 'The attorney general acts as the long arm of the government’s opponents and spares no effort to thwart the will of the voter,' Levin wrote in the motion, according to Hebrew-language media. The current coalition, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has butted heads with Baharav-Miara since its establishment in late December 2022. Levin and other critics of the Attorney General have said that she has inappropriately interfered with political appointments and decisions, falsely claiming they are unconstitutional. The Justice Minister claimed that Baharav-Miara has declared various bills and pieces of government legislation as not being legally sound due to her own political beliefs, rather than an actual legal issue. 'The attorney general thereby unlawfully turned herself into a veto power of the legislative branch against dozens of bills ministers have sought to advance,' Levin wrote. Levin also cited numerous incidents in which Baharav-Miara had refused to represent the government from petitions against it by advocacy groups - a crucial part of her role as Attorney General. Additionally, Barahav-Miara had refused to allow the government to seek outside counsel to defend itself, essentially leaving the coalition without effective legal representation. 'The attorney general has appropriated almost unlimited, unbridled power for herself, and made crude and ugly political use of it under the guise of professionalism and objectivity,' Levin argued. At one point, Baharav-Miara opposed the government's pick for a temporary head to the country's broadcast regulatory agency, yet refused to allow the government to retain a lawyer to challenge her. Levin noted that the Supreme Court had reprimanded Barahav-Miara for that specific incident.

500 Oct 7th victims sue PA for $1.2 billion over involvement in m...	The plaintiffs' case presents evidence that proves Palestinian organizations paid Nukhba terrorists and funded the October 7th massacre. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News More than 500 victims of the October 7th massacre are suing the Palestinian Authority for $1.2 billion (4.5 billion shekels) over its alleged involvement in the massacre. The plaintiffs are suing the Palestinian Authority (PA), the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and former head of the Palestinian Prisoners Affairs Committee, Qadura Fares, for damages. The plaintiffs accuse the organizations of direct and indirect involvement in planning the invasion and massacre of Israelis. Among the hundreds of plaintiffs are the Akuni family from Netiv HaAsar, where parents Ruti and Aryeh and their daughter Or were murdered; the family of Ohad Yahalomi, whose body was buried last week after being released by Hamas; and Yonatan Brosh, who was wounded in Nahal Oz while his wife Shoshana was murdered in front of him. The case was planned last year, supported by victims' testimonies and evidence of funding and planning gathered by research teams in Israel and abroad. The plaintiffs' case presents evidence that proves Palestinian organizations paid Nukhba terrorists and funded the October 7th massacre. The lawsuit reveals that between 2018 and 2023, the PA and PLO were involved in funding terrorists in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. 'The preparations and training for 'Al-Aqsa Flood' – the Palestinian name for the massacre – spanned five years and involved numerous large-scale exercises across Gaza, with thousands of terrorists from various militant groups taking part,' the lawsuit stated. 'These activities required significant logistical and governmental support from 'civilian' offices in Gaza. The funding for this support was provided by the defendants — the PA and PLO — through their budget allocations to Gaza's 'civilian' authorities,' it continued. In addition to the 4.5 billion shekels for planning and involvement in the massacre, if the PA and PLO are defeated in court, they are expected to pay further damages as a deterrent. Dubi Weissenstern, head of ZAKA search and rescue and one of the plaintiffs, said, 'Even after more than a year of war, many ZAKA volunteers and I are still haunted by the horrors we witnessed in those initial weeks. Despite our experience with disaster sites, the overwhelming scale, smells, and nightmarish scenes profoundly impacted us and those around us. This lawsuit is the most justified course of action we can take.'

As part of the hostage release and ceasefire agreement, 274 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences have been freed, with 300 remaining in Israeli jails. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In the first phase of the current hostage deal, nearly half of the total Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails were released. As part of the hostage release and ceasefire agreement, 274 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences have been freed, with 300 remaining in Israeli jails, according to Kan News. Israel is currently holding 9,406 individuals classified as terrorists and security detainees. Of these, 1,486 are serving prison sentences, 2,960 are undergoing criminal proceedings but have not yet been convicted, and 3,405 are held as administrative detainees. According to the Israel Prison Service, 1,555 Gazan terrorists were arrested during the conflict in Gaza. Additionally, approximately 1,800 Gazans arrested during the war are being held in IDF facilities. Under the agreement with Hamas, which was approved by the Cabinet, no individuals involved in the massacre of 1,200 people and the abduction of 251 during the October 7, 2023, invasion of Israel will be released. Those who fought against the IDF throughout the 15 months of the Gaza conflict are also excluded. However, reporter Avishai Grinzaig revealed that among the 1,000 security prisoners slated for release, including all women and those up to age 19 arrested by the IDF in Gaza since October 7, there is a woman known to have held hostages. Additionally, some individuals who have launched rockets in past conflicts with Israel, participated in digging terror tunnels, or are Hamas members and officials—whom Israel has not yet proven to have been involved in the current war—were also included in the list. Grinzaig said that a minister had claimed to him that 'these details were not clearly presented during the Cabinet meeting' and that they were unaware of them. Ahmed Barghouti, who masterminded suicide bombing attacks that killed twelve Israelis, walked out of an Israeli prison as part of the hostage-for-prisoners agreement, with more than 1.2 million shekels ($338,000) in his bank account, courtesy of Palestinian Authority stipends that Israelis refer to as 'pay for slay.' Mansour Shreim and Ahmed Abu Khader faced similar sums. Abu Khader, a member of the Palestinian Authority security forces, trained terrorists for suicide missions and carried out shooting attacks. Shreim was responsible for dispatching terrorists who killed nine Israeli teenagers in separate attacks in 2002. 'It’s not about supporting the families of these terrorists – it's about rewarding them for their actions,' Itamar Marcus, head of Palestinian Media Watch, told The Press Service of Israel. 'The Palestinian Authority pays salaries to terrorists while they are in Israeli prisons. The money is deposited into a private account set up for each terrorist as soon as they enter prison.'

Iran establishes new terrorist organization in Syria: ‘The Islami...	The organization emphasized that its goal is 'to defend Syria from occupation and to unite and stand against falsehood.' By Shachar Kleiman, JNS Iran’s 'Mehr' news agency announced on Wednesday morning the establishment of a new terrorist organization named 'The Islamic Resistance in Syria.' The organization was founded 'in light of the recent developments Syria has witnessed,' according to the report. In a statement released by the group, it said, 'This step is a natural and legitimate response to confront the attempts at division and displacement that the country has endured.' The statement was accompanied by a logo resembling those of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, featuring a raised hand holding a rifle. The statement declared that the organization aims to represent all sects in Syria and focus on 'defending security and territorial integrity.' It further noted that the group was established due to 'the absence of the political and social forces that previously managed Syria,' referencing the collapse of the Assad regime in December. The organization emphasized that its goal is 'to defend Syria from occupation and to unite and stand against falsehood.' In early February, the Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper 'Al-Akhbar' reported that a group calling itself 'The Syrian Resistance' had announced its operations against Israel and Islamist government forces in Damascus. The group referred to these forces as 'the gangs of al-Jolani,' referencing the nickname of Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa. The collapse of the Assad regime and the rise of the rebels have significantly undermined Iran’s regional axis. Shi’ite militias composed of Afghans and Pakistanis have fled to Iraq, and Hezbollah in Lebanon was forced to withdraw its forces and is now working to smuggle out its remaining weapons. Nevertheless, cells affiliated with the former regime continue to engage in occasional exchanges of fire with the new government. The new government in Damascus has, in recent months, called on Iran to refrain from meddling in its internal affairs. On Tuesday, al-Sharaa attended the Arab League summit in Cairo, declaring that Syria is opening a new chapter with Arab states. At the same time, he complained that Israel is taking advantage of the previous regime’s collapse. Originally published by Israel Hayom.

Released Israeli hostages suffered severe malnutrition, muscle lo...	Many are undergoing physiotherapy to rebuild lost muscle mass, while others require specialized dental treatment due to broken teeth and other oral health complications. By Pesach Benson, TPS Released hostages suffered extreme malnutrition, with some losing up to 40% of their body weight, severe muscle loss and vitamin deficiencies, the Israeli Health Ministry disclosed on Wednesday. 'In some cases, this led to muscle bleeding, causing significant pain and even affecting hemoglobin levels,' she said. 'We are seeing the effects of long-term malnutrition, which requires continued medical and rehabilitative care,' said Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Health Ministry’s medical division during a briefing for reporters. The returnees, many of whom were held in cramped conditions for extended periods, also suffered from severe vitamin deficiencies. 'We detected a significant drop in essential vitamins, including vitamin C, which in at least one case caused spontaneous muscle bleeding,' Dr. Mizrahi explained. 'Their diets were severely lacking in protein, fats, vegetables, and fruits. Some survived on empty carbohydrates that provided little to no nutritional value.' According to the Health Ministry, hostages who have been released continue to require extensive medical care, both in hospitals and through dedicated community clinics. Many are undergoing physiotherapy to rebuild lost muscle mass, while others require specialized dental treatment due to broken teeth and other oral health complications. Mizrahi also noted concerns regarding infectious diseases among the returnees, though she noted that these cases have been treated effectively. 'Some of the released hostages were forced to drink brackish water due to the lack of clean drinking water, which poses serious health risks,' she said. 'Additionally, we’ve seen returnees suffering from eye infections and other complications resulting from poor hygiene and inadequate medical care while in captivity.' Beyond the physical toll, health officials are also monitoring the psychological effects of captivity on the released hostages. While many have shown resilience, DrMizrahi warned that long-term trauma is a serious concern. 'Some returnees came back to devastating personal losses, learning that family members or loved ones were killed while they were in captivity. They are now facing the challenge of rebuilding their lives under incredibly difficult circumstances,' she said. The mental strain has also affected family members of the abductees. 'We’ve seen cases where the emotional toll has even manifested physically,' Dr. Mizrahi noted. 'Some family members have experienced dental problems due to stress-related grinding or clenching of teeth. The psychological impact of these traumatic events extends beyond the hostages themselves.' The Health Ministry has urged international organizations, particularly the Red Cross, to ensure that the hostages who remain in captivity receive proper nutrition and medical care. 'We fear that the longer the remaining hostages stay in captivity, the worse their medical condition will become,' Dr. Mizrahi warned. 'There is a real danger to their lives.' Israeli authorities are also collecting testimonies from the returnees to document the conditions they endured. The ministry has pledged to work closely with the families to ensure that future reports on the health of abductees are conducted with their full consent. 'This is not just about treating them now—it’s about ensuring long-term recovery,' Dr. Mizrahi emphasized. 'We must remain vigilant and do everything in our power to bring the remaining hostages home safely and provide them with the care they desperately need.' At least 1,180 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 59 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

Trump cuts US intelligence sharing to Ukraine	The pause follows a decision early this week by President Donald Trump to freeze future deliveries of weapons to Ukraine. By Jewish Breaking News For nearly three years, an unprecedented river of intelligence flowed from American sources to Ukrainian forces to help defend themselves against Russian forces. That river has now run dry. 'Trump had a real question about whether (Ukrainian) President (Volodymyr) Zelenskyy was committed to the peace process, and he said: ‘Let’s pause, I want to give you a chance to think about that,'' CIA Director John Ratcliffe revealed to Fox News on Wednesday. 'On the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, I think will go away.' It is not immediately clear which specific areas of intelligence sharing have been restricted. In 2024, US media reported that the CIA provided Kyiv the ability to monitor Russian troop movements, support spy networks, and conduct targeted missile strikes. The pause follows a decision early this week by President Donald Trump to freeze future deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace negotiations with Russia. On Tuesday, the embattled Ukrainian leader apologized for last week’s Oval Office confrontation, during which Trump accused him of showing insufficient gratitude for America’s financial and military assistance. Trump’s attitude toward Zelensky notably softened after he disclosed receiving a letter of appreciation from the Ukrainian president, which he highlighted during his State of the Union address. 'My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,' Zelenskyy wrote as quoted by the president. However, Ukrainian missile operators have been reporting screens going dark and targeting coordinates no longer arriving for quite some time now. A Ukrainian military officer familiar with operations of the long-range multiple rocket launching system the Washington Post that for roughly the past month, at least one of the Ukrainian units responsible for launching rockets from U.S. provided systems has not received coordinates to strike more than about 40 miles beyond the contact line.

Shin Bet dismissed Hamas SIM card warning hours before Oct. 7	The Shin Bet report also blamed Israeli government policy from July 2018 until 'Operation Guardian of the Walls' in May 2021, which offered economic benefits to restrain Hamas. By JNS Unusual activity of Hamas’s communications network was noted after midnight on the night of Oct. 6, 2023, hours before the Hamas invasion, which began at 6:30 on the morning of Saturday the 7th, but the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) disregarded the activity as insignificant. At 2:45 a.m. on Oct. 7, Israeli security forces received a report that dozens of SIM cards (necessary for phones to work on a mobile network), were activated in the Gaza Strip, Israel’s Kan News reported on Tuesday. It was not the first such activation. One took place the night before, on Friday evening at around 9 o’clock. (By Wednesday, Oct. 5, some 45 Hamas communication devices had also been activated). However, an intelligence summary by the Shin Bet southern region sent to a group of intelligence and political officials dismissed the activity. 'Today and yesterday there were SIMs in certain areas of Gaza. This is not unusual, since similar tests were carried out by Hamas last year as well,' the summary stated. 'According to the division and the command [leadership], Hamas has not changed its routine. The information is preliminary and there are routine activities in Hamas. A discussion on the matter will be held by the Southern Command Intelligence Officer at 08:30 and by the Southern Command heads at 10:00,' it added. The head of IDF Southern Command, Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, asked, 'Are we on alert?' He was answered in the negative, Kan News reported. The Shin Bet had issued an earlier statement at 1 a.m. on Oct. 7 that also dismissed various indications of a possible attack, Israel Hayom reported. That intelligence report stated: 'A sequence of concerning signs indicates Hamas is preparing for an attack. At the same time, field indicators suggest routine and restraint, with the background of a recently agreed ‘understanding’ leading to the assessment that Hamas is not interested in escalation or starting a campaign at this time.' Later, however, the agency expressed concern about the possibility of an attack, though of a much smaller scale than what transpired. Warning at 3:03 a.m. The Shin Bet issued a warning at 3:03 a.m. on Oct. 7 to the IDF, police and National Security Council, stating: 'We have an indication of activation and activity of Hamas’s communication network across several brigades. We lack details on the nature of the activity, though the cumulative unusual activity, alongside additional indicators, may point to an offensive action.' At about 3:30 a.m., IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi was alerted. He arranged for a situational assessment by phone, which took place 90 minutes later. Halevi, IDF Operations Directorate head Maj. Gen. Oded Basyuk and Finkelman were updated on the signs of an imminent attack. Halevi requested more information. He ordered an update sent to the Israeli Air Force. The Shin Bet director, Ronen Bar, convened a 4:30 a.m. meeting with regional heads. Possible scenarios covered included a localized surprise raid or kidnapping. Instructions were given to prepare intelligence and operational responses, Israel Hayom reported. A 'Tequila' team composed of Shin Bet fighters and members of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, designed to deal with the localized raid scenario, was sent out, according to a recently released internal report by the Shin Bet on its failures to properly respond to the invasion threat. The Shin Bet report also blamed Israeli government policy from July 2018 until 'Operation Guardian of the Walls' in May 2021, which offered economic benefits to restrain Hamas. The agency warned that Hamas was not deterred. 'The investigation demonstrates that the Shin Bet did not underestimate the enemy. On the contrary—there was initiative, pursuit of engagement, and an effort to eliminate the threat at its inception, and yet we failed,' Bar said. Channel 14 commentator Yaakov Bardugo reported on Wednesday that the Cabinet is expected to convene, read the Shin Bet’s report, and recommend the immediate dismissal of Bar in 'disgrace.' 'The document in question reveals a series of professional and moral failures that cannot be rectified,' Bardugo said. With the release of the report, Bar said, 'As the head of the organization, I will bear this heavy burden on my shoulders for the rest of my life. The investigation shows that had the Shin Bet acted differently, both professionally and administratively, in the years leading up to the attack and on the night of the assault, the massacre could have been prevented.'

West faces surge in lone-wolf terrorism, global attacks up 11%	A concerning trend emerged among younger individuals, with one in five terror suspects in Western nations being under 18. By Pesach Benson, TPS The number of countries affected by terrorism increased from 58 to 66 in 2024, reversing nearly a decade of progress in reducing global terrorist incidents, according to a report released on Wednesday. The 12th annual Global Terrorism Index, produced by the Sydney-based Institute for Economics & Peace, noted a rise in fatalities driven by the world’s four deadliest terrorist groups, a growing trend of lone-wolf attacks in the West, and escalating hate crimes linked to the Israel-Hamas war and other geopolitical conflicts. 'The best way to control terrorism is to stop or reduce the number of conflicts,' said Steve Killelea, the institute’s founder and chairman. 'This year’s Global Terrorism Index highlights two key concerns: 98% of all terrorist deaths occurred in conflict zones, and social tensions in the West are fuelling lone actor terrorism.' The Islamic State (IS) remains the world’s deadliest terrorist organization, responsible for 1,805 deaths in 2024 across 22 countries. The group remains most active in Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), with its Khorasan Province (ISK) emerging as one of the fastest-growing jihadist factions. ISK has expanded its operations from one country to five since 2020, producing propaganda in nine languages and launching significant attacks in Iran and Russia. Another major concern is Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which recorded a 90% increase in fatalities, making it the fastest-growing terrorist group. The index also found that one-fifth of all terrorism fatalities took place in Burkina Faso. The West experienced its highest rise in terrorist incidents since 2017, with attacks increasing by 63%. The majority of these were lone-wolf attacks, which accounted for 93% of all fatal incidents in the region over the past five years. Germany, Sweden, Australia, Finland, and the Netherlands reported their first attacks in over five years, with Germany ranking 27th globally following the Magdeburg Christmas market attack. Younger ‘Lone Wolf’ Terrorists A concerning trend emerged among younger individuals, with one in five terror suspects in Western nations being under 18. In the United Kingdom alone, under-18s accounted for 42% of all terror-related arrests. These individuals typically lack formal ties to organized terrorist groups and often combine contradictory extremist ideologies, the report said. Although the Middle East saw a 7% reduction in terrorist attacks in 2024, ongoing violence between Israel and Palestinian terror groups continues to destabilize the region. Israel and Syria both ranked among the ten most affected countries. The Gaza conflict has also intensified global hate crimes, with a 200% rise in antisemitic incidents in the United States and a parallel increase in Islamophobic attacks worldwide, according to the report. 'The Gaza conflict has been, and still is, a catalyst for antisemitism and Islamophobia,' Killelea said. The Sahel region of sub-Sahara Africa remains the most affected by terrorism, accounting for over half of global terrorism deaths in 2024. Burkina Faso recorded the highest number of fatalities, while neighboring Togo saw its worst year on record. The instability is driven by weak governance, ethnic tensions, and competition over mineral resources, particularly gold and uranium. Despite some improvements in certain sub-Saharan regions, Niger saw a dramatic 94% rise in terrorism-related deaths, marking the highest increase globally. The withdrawal of French troops and the growing presence of Russian security forces have further complicated the region’s security dynamics. Terrorism and Technology: A Growing Concern Terrorist organizations are increasingly leveraging emerging technologies to expand their operations, embracing artificial intelligence to produce propaganda and leveraging encrypted messaging apps and cryptocurrency for fundraising. 'The rapid evolution of technology presents both challenges and opportunities,' the report said. 'While extremists exploit encryption and AI for their operations, security agencies are also using AI to detect radicalization earlier and analyze vast amounts of data more effectively.' Although global terrorism deaths remained stable in 2024, the overall threat landscape has grown more complex. The first major attack of 2025, where an IS-pledged individual killed 15 people in New Orleans, signals a potential resurgence of terrorist activities. Security agencies are on high alert following 24 foiled IS-linked plots last year, including a high-profile attempt to target Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna. 'The world must recognize that terrorism is deeply linked to instability,' said Killelea. 'Reducing conflict and addressing social tensions are key to curbing the threat.'

US envoy holds direct talks with Hamas on hostage deal – report	The U.S. is sending the message that if Hamas shows goodwill and the hostages are released, the ceasefire agreement will move forward. By World Israel News Staff An unnamed source told i24 on Wednesday that a U.S. envoy has been in direct talks with Hamas regarding the release of hostages and a ceasefire. A source familiar with the matter reported that U.S. Hostage Envoy Adam Boehler has met several times with Hamas representatives in Qatar. The U.S. is sending the message that if Hamas shows goodwill and the hostages are released, the ceasefire agreement will move forward. Israel has been informed of this development. Currently, 59 hostages remain in Gaza, including five Americans. Edan Alexander is believed to be the only U.S. hostage still alive. Last week, Israel formally agreed to a temporary ceasefire proposed by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, set to last through Ramadan and Passover. Under the terms of the agreement, half of the hostages, both living and deceased, will be released on the first day of the ceasefire’s implementation. The remaining hostages will be freed at the end of the ceasefire period, provided a permanent ceasefire agreement is successfully negotiated. When Hamas rejected this deal, Israel froze the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip over the weekend. Hamas demands that Israel conclude negotiations with the terror group for implementing the second phase of the January 19th ceasefire, as outlined by President Joe Biden in May 2024. The proposed second phase would include a far more comprehensive agreement than either the expired first phase or the American proposal for an extension, and it would involve an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. On Sunday morning, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced that, given Hamas’s refusal to continue releasing Israeli hostages or accept the U.S. proposal, Israel has halted the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip. 'With the conclusion of the first stage of the hostage deal and in light of Hamas’s refusal to accept the Witkoff framework for continuing the talks, to which Israel has agreed, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, the entry of all goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be halted,' the Prime Minister’s Office announced. 'Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas persists in its refusal, there will be additional consequences,' the PMO stated.

Israel reveals Eurovision 2025 song titled ‘New Day Will Rise,’ t...	Renowned Israeli songwriter Keren Peles wrote the lyrics and melody for 'New Day Will Rise,' the musical arrangement and production were done by Tomer Biran, and the French translation was provided by Tamir Hitman. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11 announced on Monday that Israel’s song for the 69th Eurovision Song Contest is titled 'New Day Will Rise,' which will be performed in the international singing competition by Yuval Raphael. The track will feature lyrics in three languages – English, Hebrew, and French. Raphael, 24, performed songs in all three languages while competing on the Israeli singing competition 'HaKochav Haba' ('Rising Star'), whose winner goes on to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest. The Ra’anana native won the 11th season of the Israeli competition that began in November and ended in mid-January. She will represent her home country in this year’s Eurovision, which will take place in Basel, Switzerland, in May. Raphael lived as a child with her family in Switzerland for three years and she is fluent in French. Renowned Israeli songwriter Keren Peles wrote the lyrics and melody for 'New Day Will Rise.' The musical arrangement and production were done by Tomer Biran, and the French translation was provided by Tamir Hitman. Kan 11 will debut the full song on Sunday during a special broadcast. Raphael is a survivor of the Hamas-led terrorist attack at the Nova Music Festival on Oct. 7, 2023. She hid in a roadside bomb shelter near the site of the musical festival and laid beneath dead bodies of victims, pretending to be dead for several hours, until she was rescued. She talked about her experience during the massacre in a speech given before the United Nations Human Rights Committee. Similar to last year, there are already efforts to boycott Israel’s participation in the 2025 Eurovision Song Contest, because of the country’s military actions during its war against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip who orchestrated the deadly rampage across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The Slovenian public broadcaster RTVSLO has asked the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the Eurovision context, to expel Israel from this year’s competition, and the Spanish public broadcaster RTVE said last week that its board of directors will discuss whether it will urge the EBU to do the same. In the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place during the Israel-Hamas war, Israel’s representative Eden Golan finished in fifth place with the song 'Hurricane,' despite facing death threats, being booed on stage by anti-Israel protesters, and having a jury member refuse to give her points because of his personal dislike for Israel. Golan said she was forced to wear a disguise outside her hotel during the competition in Malmo, Sweden, because of the threats she received from those who opposed Israel’s participation in the contest. One of Golan’s fellow competitors in the Eurovision admitted that she received 'so much hate' during the contest. In 2023, Israeli singer Noa Kirel finished third in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song 'Unicorn.' The last time Israel won the Eurovision was in 2018 with Israeli singer Netta Barzilai and her song 'Toy.'

17-year-old Israeli injured in recent car-ramming attack dies of ...	A week before the attack that killed Gur, a string of empty buses exploded sequentially in the Tel Aviv area. By Ben Sales, JTA A 17-year-old Israeli girl who was critically injured in a terror attack last week has died of her wounds. Yahli Gur was one of more than a dozen people wounded when an attacker rammed his vehicle into a bus stop roughly midway between Tel Aviv and the northern port city of Haifa. She was hospitalized, and her death was announced Wednesday, six days after the attack. The ramming was one in a string of recent attacks in Israel that have come amid rising regional tensions. A week before the attack that killed Gur, a string of empty buses exploded sequentially in the Tel Aviv area, prompting the Israeli military to launch an operation in northern Samaria targeting terror groups. Palestinian authorities say tens of thousands have been displaced in the crackdown. This week, a man was stabbed to death in Haifa. And in Gaza, a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that formally expired on Sunday is teetering.

Muslim leaders pay condolence call to family of slain Israeli hos...	Moroccan sheikh and Israeli Arab imams join interfaith delegation paying a condolence call to the Bibas family mourning the murders of Shiri Bibas and her sons Kfir and Ariel. By World Israel News Staff An interfaith delegation of rabbis, imams, and sheikhs from across Israel, along with Sheikh Mohammed Al-Abidu from Morocco, arrived in Kfar Maccabiah on Sunday to console the Bibas family following the return of the bodies of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas, who were brutally murdered in Hamas captivity. The visit was initiated by the Religious Communities Division of the Israeli Ministry of the Interior, the Ohr Torah Interfaith Center, the Interfaith Leadership Forum in Israel, the Druze Religious Council, and additional faith leaders including rabbis from the Chief Rabbinate Council. The delegation came together to offer condolences, standing in solidarity with the bereaved family and denouncing the horrific violence that claimed their loved ones. 'The Interfaith Leaders Forum in Israel stands in deep solidarity with the Bibas family in their immense grief,' said Sheikh Younes Amasha, chairperson of the Interfaith Leaders Forum. 'We call on world leaders to do everything in their power to secure the safe return of all remaining hostages and to work toward ending this cycle of violence. Peace and security are fundamental values in every faith, and we urge all to uphold them with unwavering commitment.' 'Today, we stood together—rabbis, imams, and sheikhs—united in grief and solidarity with the Bibas family,' said Rabbi Aharon Ariel Lavi, Managing Director of the Ohr Torah Interfaith Center. 'This visit was not just about offering condolences, but about reaffirming our shared humanity and the belief that no family should endure such pain. Our faiths may differ, but our commitment to compassion and justice binds us together.' Sheikh Mohammed Al-Abidu, who traveled from Morocco to participate in the delegation, emphasized the shared values of peace and dignity across faiths. 'I came from Morocco to join my brothers in faith in expressing our deepest sorrow and support for the Bibas family. Islam teaches us the sanctity of life, and what happened here is a tragedy for all humanity. We stand together in mourning, and we pray for a future of peace and understanding between all peoples.' Iyad Sirkhan, Director of the Division for Religious Communities at the Ministry of the Interior, added' 'The presence of so many religious leaders here today underscores our shared responsibility to stand against evil and to offer comfort where we can. This tragedy touches us all, and we remain committed to strengthening the bonds between our communities in pursuit of a more just and compassionate society.' Shiri Bibas, her husband Yarden, and the couple’s two sons were abducted by Gazan terrorists on October 7th, 2023. While Yarden was returned to Israel alive on February 1st, 2025, the remains of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were returned to Israel weeks later. Forensic analysis of the bodies suggested that the three were murdered in captivity in November 2023, contradicting Hamas’ claim that they were killed by an IDF airstrike. Israeli officials stated that the Bibas children were apparently killed with 'bare hands,' and that their skulls were later crushed in such a way to make it appear as if they had been killed by rubble from an airstrike.

US rejects alternative plan to Gaza resettlement, argues Gaza ‘un...	White House spokesman rejects Arab-backed proposal to remove Hamas from power while leaving Gazans in place, says US stands by Trump’s vision of resettling the Strip’s population. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The United States on Tuesday rejected an Egyptian plan to rehabilitate the Gaza Strip and remove Hamas from power, without resettling the coastal enclave’s population of roughly two million. Earlier on Tuesday, Arab leaders voted at a Cairo summit to back a 112-page proposal drafted by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government. Egypt pushed the plan as an alternative to President Donald Trump’s Gaza resettlement plan, under which Gazans would be relocated to third-party countries and the Gaza Strip transferred to the United States. Under the Egyptian proposal, a non-partisan interim committee of Palestinian Arabs would be formed to administer Gaza after the formal end of the current war between Israel and Hamas. Once the Palestinian Authority has undergone a major reformation, control of the Gaza Strip would be transferred from the committee to the PA. Foreign aid would pay for the years-long reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip in the Egyptian plan, while Gazans would be temporarily relocated within the Strip during the lengthy period of rebuilding. Hours after the plan was adopted at the Cairo summit, however, White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said Tuesday night that the U.S. would not accept the Egyptian plan, and that the administration remains committed to the president’s resettlement plan. Hughes argued that the Gaza Strip is presently 'uninhabitable,' necessitating their relocation. 'The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable, and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance,' Hughes said. 'President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.'

New IDF chief sworn in amid calls for October 7th probe	Hamas 'not yet defeated,' says Israeli military's new chief of staff, Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir, vowing to complete 'the mission.' By Pesach Benson, TPS Amid calls for a commission of inquiry into the failures of October 7th, Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir was installed as Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces in a ceremony at the military’s Tel Aviv headquarters on Wednesday. 'The task, which I am receiving today, is clear: Lead the IDF to victory,' Zamir said in his address after being conferred with his new rank. 'On the morning of October 7th, the IDF failed in its mission. The border was breached. Our enemies penetrated our communities, slaughtered our people, our children, our women, and our brothers,' said Zamir. 'From the rift, the people of Israel rose and once again proved their strength and unity in moments of testing. Civilians and soldiers, strove for contact, charged and fought individually and in small units, and even paid with their lives.' 'They proved to us that we are brothers. The IDF achieved impressive achievements on the battlefield. We won battles in Gaza and Lebanon, attacked in Yemen and Iran. The murderous terrorist organization, Hamas, has indeed suffered a severe blow, but it has not yet been defeated. The mission is not yet complete,' he added. At least 1,180 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 59 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead. Following the ceremony, Zamir and his predecessor, Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Demands for a Commission of Inquiry Zamir’s promotion comes amid increasing calls for a state commission of inquiry. Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. They may include personal recommendations about individuals under investigation, though the government is not bound to act on them. Critics accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of delaying the inquiry and trying to water down the powers of a commission. Pressed by lawmakers to explain why no state commission of inquiry has been established into the failures of October 7 after 17 months, Netanyahu said on Monday he opposed a 'politically biased' panel. His remarks were marred by scuffles that broke out between bereaved families and Knesset guards. According to a series of army probes, some 5,000 terrorists from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad managed to attack numerous Israeli communities and overrun the army’s border positions. The army’s chain of command broke amid the chaos and soldiers were outnumbered. For years, the army misunderstood Hamas’s intentions, and as October 7 approached, intelligence about the looming attack was misinterpreted. The military was also more focused on threats from Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the probes found. The army’s investigations only deal with issues of operations, intelligence and command, not decisions made by the political echelon. Halevi announced his resignation in January as the army’s investigations were nearing completion. The IDF Chief of Staff serves for three years with the possibility of a one-year extension. The last chief of staff to leave the post before the end of his term was Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz, who resigned in 2007 over IDF failures during the Second Lebanon War of 2006. From Armored Corps to Chief of Staff Zamir, 59, was born and raised in Eilat. He is the first Chief of Staff to begin his career in the Armored Corps. After joining the army in 1984 he became a tank commander, gradually climbing the ranks. He was eventually appointed as Netanyahu’s military secretary from 2012-2015. From 2018 to 2021, he was deputy chief of staff before becoming a visiting research fellow at the Washington-based Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Zamir was also considered for the Chief of Staff in 2018 and 2022. In 2023, he was appointed Director General of the Defense Ministry. He also has degrees from Tel Aviv and Haifa Universities and is a graduate of Wharton University’s General Management Program.

World’s largest semiconductor chipmaker invests $100 billion in U...	Apple also announced last week that it will commit more than $500 billion to expanding its facilities and investments in the United States over the next four years. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest chipmaker, will invest $100 billion in new chip manufacturing plants across the United States, President Donald Trump announced Monday. 'This is a tremendous move by the most powerful company in the world,' Trump said alongside TSMC CEO C.C. Wei. 'It's a matter of economic security, it's also a matter of national security for us.' TSMC will make the investment over the next four years, expanding its U.S. operations with 'cutting-edge' facilities, the Wall Street Journal reported. Semiconductor chips are essential to modern technology, powering everything from cars to computers to smartphones. Demand has surged in recent years, driven by the rapid growth of artificial intelligence, which requires immense computing power. The Taiwanese chipmaker is just the latest tech company to pledge billion-dollar investments in the United States since Trump's return to the White House. Apple announced last week that it will commit more than $500 billion to expanding its facilities and investments in the United States over the next four years. In January, Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank unveiled Stargate, a joint venture aimed at expanding U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure, with a combined investment of $500 billion over the coming years. The Monday announcement comes just weeks after Trump said he was considering tariffs of 25 percent or more on semiconductor imports. Trump views U.S. reliance on foreign chipmakers as a national security risk and has repeatedly pledged to bring more chip manufacturing back to the United States. 'We have to have chips made in this country,' Trump said last month. 'Right now, everything is made in Taiwan, practically, almost all of it, a little bit in South Korea, but everything—almost all of it is made in Taiwan. And we want it to be made—we want those companies to come to our country, in all due respect.' TSMC made its first major U.S. manufacturing investment during Trump's first term, committing $12 billion to build a chip factory in Arizona. 'Back in 2020, thanks to President Trump's vision and support, we embarked on our journey of establishing advanced chip manufacturing in the United States,' the chipmaking giant said in a Monday statement. Also, Honda announced it is shifting production of the Civic from Mexico to the United States, in response to President Donald Trump's planned 25 percent tariffs on Mexican imports, sources told Reuters. Starting in May 2028, the Japanese automaker will begin manufacturing the new Civic hybrid in Indiana to avoid potential tariffs, the sources said. The Civic, one of Honda's top-selling models, is expected to have an annual output of around 210,000 units. The announcement comes just a day before Trump's 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods are set to take effect, part of the administration's efforts to curb drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Trump announced a 30-day pause on the tariffs, which were originally slated to go into effect last month, after Mexico and Canada agreed to deploy troops and personnel to secure their borders with the United States. Mexico has long been a low-cost production hub for automakers, with Honda exporting around 80 percent of its Mexican output to the United States, Reuters reported. Trump has pledged to boost domestic manufacturing, arguing that tariffs help protect American workers and counter foreign 'unfair trade practices.' Since returning to the Oval Office, Trump has increased tariffs on Chinese goods, levied 25 percent tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports, and announced reciprocal tariffs on U.S. competitors and allies alike.

Fury erupts over Hamas terrorists treated in Israeli hospitals	A consensus began forming around expanding prison medical facilities where specialists could provide care without terrorists entering public hospitals. By Jewish Breaking News In Israeli hospitals, victims of terror and the terrorists who harmed them sometimes lie just rooms apart. Since Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 massacre in 2023, an estimated 150 to 200 terrorists have received medical care in the same hospitals as Jewish civilians. On Monday, Israel’s National Security Committee held a meeting to try and end the practice once and for all. 'This situation is infuriating and surreal, and it has no place in the country anymore,' said Committee Chair MK Boaz Bismuth, who described the terrorists receiving treatment as 'sometimes shoulder-to-shoulder with their victims.' Representatives from eight different political parties spanning from the right-wing Otzma Yehudit to the centrist Yesh Atid had jointly requested the meeting. But MK Yulia Malinovsky revealed troubling allegations about transparency. 'There is no official figure because the system is silencing the event, and physicians do not receive authorization to appear before the Knesset committees and talk about the issue,' she said. 'When they do, the system takes revenge on them.' A consensus began forming around expanding prison medical facilities where specialists could provide care without terrorists entering public hospitals. But practical challenges remain. Dr. Miriam Madar of Prison Medical Services pointed out that the medical staff on duty 'cannot always differentiate between life-threatening and non-life-threatening cases.' According to Israel’s Patient Rights Law, hospitals must provide treatment in life-threatening situations or severe disability. In 2024, the Israeli Medical Association published a letter stating that 'treating Hamas terrorists is our duty as doctors.' Due to this law, Oct. 7 architect Yahya Sinwar was saved from certain death when doctors discovered and operated on the former terror leader’s brain tumor in 2004.

Yale Law School scholar is member of US-sanctioned terror fundrai...	Reached for comment, a spokesman for Yale Law School told the Free Beacon that the law school takes the allegations 'extremely seriously' and that Doutaghi has been placed on administrative leave. By Eliana Johnson, The Washington Free Beacon A research scholar at Yale Law School also moonlights as a member of a U.S.-sanctioned terrorist fundraising entity, according to web postings reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. Those postings reveal that Helyeh Doutaghi, the deputy director of Yale Law School’s Law and Political Economy Project, is a member of Samidoun, an organization sanctioned by the U.S. government in October in an announcement that described it as a 'sham charity' and a 'front organization' for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a foreign-designated terrorist organization. Samidoun’s website indicates that Doutaghi, whom it describes as 'a doctoral student of international law and a member of the international Samidoun Network,' delivered a speech in Iran at a Samidoun-sponsored screening of the film Fedayin: Georges Abdallah’s Fight. Abdallah, the founder of the Lebanese Armed Military Forces, was sentenced by a French court to life in prison in 1987, convicted of complicity in the 1982 murders of U.S. military attaché Charles Ray and Israeli diplomat Yacov Barsimantov, as well as involvement in the attempted 1984 assassination of the then-American consul general in Strasbourg, Robert Homme. The relationship between Doutaghi and Samidoun was first reported by the Substack Jewish Onliner and the Buckley Beacon. Reached for comment, a spokesman for Yale Law School told the Free Beacon that the law school takes the allegations 'extremely seriously' and that Doutaghi has been placed on administrative leave. 'We take these allegations extremely seriously and immediately opened an investigation into the matter to ascertain the facts,' the spokesman, Alden Ferro, told the Free Beacon. 'Helyeh Doutaghi’s short-term position as an associate research scholar with the LPE Project expires next month. Until then, she has been placed on an immediate administrative leave pending the outcome of this investigation.' Doutaghi, according to Samidoun, also traveled with a Samidoun group on a 2023 'fact-finding mission' to Venezuela to observe the impact of 'U.S. sanctions and coercive economic measures.' The mission was co-sponsored by three entities, including the International People’s Tribunal on U.S. Imperialism: Sanctions, Blockades, Coercive Economic Measures, of which Samidoun was a co-sponsor. Doutaghi’s connection to Yale Law School is raising eyebrows on Capitol Hill and in the White House, where lawmakers and administration officials have pledged to crack down on anti-Semitism and extremism on university campuses, which receive billions of dollars in federal funding. 'Schools like Yale that coddle anti-Semitic extremists in their student body or faculty should not see a dime of federal funding,' said Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.), the chairman of the Republican Conference and of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services, along with the Government Services Administration, announced on Monday that they are investigating $51 billion in federal grants to Columbia University, citing the school’s 'ongoing inaction in the face of relentless harassment of Jewish students.' President Donald Trump, for his part, said in a social media post that 'Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came.' Doutaghi, who holds an undergraduate degree from Ottawa’s Carleton University and a master’s from King’s College London and who taught at Carleton University before she arrived at Yale, according to her online biography, does not appear to be an American citizen. Yale Law School did not comment on Doutaghi’s immigration status. Yale Law School’s Law and Political Economy Project, where Doutaghi serves as deputy director, is supported by a $600,000 grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which says it 'invests in creative thinkers and problem solvers who are working to ensure everyone has a meaningful opportunity to thrive.' The grant to Yale Law School is intended to develop the philosophy of law and political economy as a response to neoliberalism in order to cultivate a 'wide-ranging shift that will change the way law is studied and taught, the public discussion of legal and political institutions and power, and law’s role in policymaking and political mobilization,' the Hewlett Foundation says. The Hewlett Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Helyeh Doutaghi pictured with Samidoun International Coordinator Charlotte Kates in Venezuela Doutaghi was also scheduled to speak on a panel in October alongside PFLP and Samidoun leader Khaled Barakat, who was personally sanctioned by the U.S. government in October. At the time, the Biden administration indicated that Barakat’s 'fundraising and recruitment efforts support the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel' and that 'Barakat has previously publicly acknowledged Samidoun’s affiliation with the PFLP, despite direction from PFLP leadership to maintain the confidential nature of the relationship.' Helyeh Doutaghi, left, pictured under Samidoun flag The panel was postponed indefinitely, however, due to what Samidoun described as 'the recent Zionist escalation and atrocities against Iran and Lebanon, which represent an existential threat to all peoples in the region and to the planet.' The panel was to discuss how Israel 'intensified the ongoing genocide by assassinating Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas,' which Samidoun described as 'a blatant violation of Iranian sovereignty under international law' that 'propelled the struggle for liberation in the Arab-Iranian region against Zionist-imperialist aggression into a new phase.'

Israel begins leadership of International Holocaust Remembrance A...	Israel will be taking over IHRA’s presidency from the United Kingdom, which headed the organization for the past year with Lord Eric Pickles serving as chair. By David Swindle, The Algemeiner Israel this week assumed the presidency of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), an intergovernmental organization comprising dozens of countries dedicated to combating antisemitism and promoting Holocaust research and education. Dani Dayan — chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel’s national memorial to the Holocaust in Jerusalem — will represent the Jewish state as chair of IHRA. 'We are at a crossroads of generations, and the responsibility of preserving the memory and sharing the stories of the Holocaust will soon rest solely on our shoulders. The voices of victims and survivors demand that we honor their legacy by standing firm against Holocaust denial, distortion, and hatred,' Dayan said in a statement. 'In a world witnessing a dramatic rise in antisemitism and grappling with the challenges and opportunities of emerging technologies, our obligation to historical truth has never been more critical.' Israel’s presidency of IHRA began on Monday and will run through February 2026. 'The antisemitism that resulted in the Holocaust has not been eradicated from the world. On the contrary, over the past year and a half, we have witnessed it intensifying dramatically, targeting both the Jewish people and the Jewish state,' Israeli Foreign Minister Giden Sa’ar added in his own statement, referring to the historic surge in antisemitic incidents around the world since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of southern Israel. 'The new antisemites attack Israel’s right to exist and its right to defend itself,' Sa’ar continued. 'It is our duty not only to remember the Holocaust but also to ensure the existence of the Jewish state, which serves as the guarantee of Jewish continuity for generations to come, while also preserving and passing on the memory of the Holocaust to future generations.' US Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed Israel as the new president of IHRA. 'Today the United States warmly welcomes the start of Israel’s year-long presidency of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), which is committed to supporting accurate Holocaust commemoration, education, and research,' Rubio said in a press statement. 'We also congratulate the United Kingdom on its completion of a highly successful presidency.' Rubio added, 'The United States will partner with Israel during its IHRA presidency to defend the memory and historical fact of the Holocaust and fight the toxic spread of Holocaust denial and distortion and all other forms of antisemitism.' The top American diplomat warned of an aggressive US response to the ongoing rise in antisemitism. 'Holocaust distortion, a shocking form of antisemitism, has proliferated and the poison of antisemitism continues to spread,' Rubio said. 'We see it in violent attacks on Jews, defacement of Holocaust memorials, and dangerous rhetoric in universities and international organizations. President Trump and I have made the United States’ position unmistakably clear: the United States will confront antisemitism with determination and resolve.' Israel will be taking over IHRA’s presidency from the United Kingdom, which headed the organization for the past year with Lord Eric Pickles serving as chair. 'The aim was to bring out the best in the IHRA, engender confidence in difficult times, and, above all, strengthen the organization,' Pickles said at a handover ceremony in Jerusalem. 'Those of us who attended the poignant 80th anniversary ceremony at Auschwitz-Birkenau in January know that we will never see the like again.' Pickles added that '10 years from now, at the 90th anniversary, it is unlikely there will be Holocaust survivors to speak. We are now the custodians of their memory. We must remember and tell the truth.' Recent Legislative Efforts Regarding the IHRA Antisemitism Definition IHRA adopted a 'working definition' of antisemitism in 2016. Since then, the definition has been widely accepted by Jewish groups and lawmakers across the political spectrum, and it is now used by hundreds of governing institutions, including the US State Department, European Union, and United Nations. Dozens of US states have also formally adopted it through law or executive action. In recent months, several additional measures have been taken to expand the definition’s usage. Last month, for example, Australia’s 39 universities announced that the IHRA working definition of antisemitism would be used in assessing antisemitism on campus. The country has seen a string of antisemitic crimes which authorities suspect foreign actors of masterminding. On Feb. 20, US Sens. Katie Britt (R-AL), Tim Scott (R-SC), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) introduced the Antisemitism Awareness Act to implement the definition in the US Department of Education. 'We cannot allow antisemitism to fester in our schools, on our college campuses, or anywhere in our society. This legislation would give the Department of Education the tools to hold students and institutions accountable,' Britt said at the time. 'Any American educational institution authorizing, facilitating, or otherwise supporting pro-terrorism activities should lose every cent of federal funding and subsidization.' On Feb. 26, the Missouri House of Representatives Higher Education and Workforce Development Committee heard the case for a bill to use the IHRA definition at the state’s schools. Two weeks earlier, the Kansas House Committee on Education received a presentation on a bill to codify the definition for the state’s schools. On Feb. 3, the Nebraska Legislature Education Committee conducted a hearing for a bill also seeking to implement the IHRA definition in schools. In late January, state representatives and community members met at the New Jersey statehouse to speak out in support of a bill for the state to adopt the IHRA definition. The legislation’s primary sponsor, Assemblyman Gary Schaer, said that 'today we have an opportunity to do something truly profound — pass bipartisan legislation that will protect a religious minority.' To resolve two lawsuits, Harvard agreed to implement the IHRA definition and to release an annual report for the next five years documenting responses to violations of Title VI of the US Civil Rights Act of 1964. In January, Oklahoma State Rep. John Waldron, a Democrat elected in Tulsa, put forward legislation to use the IHRA definition in the state’s guide for employees assessing bigotry. On Jan. 26, the student government of Rutgers University voted down a measure to embrace the definition. Days earlier, Ireland announced its embrace of the IHRA definition, despite the Irish government’s harsh criticism of Israel and amid a surge of antisemitism in the country. In December 2024, a group of 24 Israeli colleges announced plans to use the IHRA definition.

In a first, UN to recognize victims of Hamas’ psychological terro...	The report will charge Hamas with violating the international laws of war. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The UN will officially recognize for the first time Wednesday Hamas' use of psychological terrorism over the course of the war in Gaza, Kan Reshet Bet reported on its 'This Morning' talk show. The report will charge Hamas with violating the international laws of war due to the many videos it has released of hostages it and other terror groups abducted during the October 7, 2023 invasion of Israel. Dr. Alice Edwards, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, will present her report in the UN branch in Geneva, Switzerland, after having visited Israel and meeting families of those forced to beg for the Israeli government to make a deal to get them released, with their deteriorating physical condition being clear for all to see. Edwards also met with some of the hostages who were freed in the first deal, implemented seven weeks into the war, when most of the female hostages and all the living minors were exchanged for a temporary ceasefire, a huge increase in humanitarian aid, and some 240 Palestinian prisoners, also women and minors. The report clearly defines the families as victims of mental and psychological torture by Hamas. Dr. Shelly Aviv Yeni, volunteer head of the International Law Department at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, told the show’s interviewers that the report 'also mentions that families of kidnapped people often experience depression and chronic anxiety' as a result of the horrific videos, 'which include the use of manipulations intended to confuse family members.' The Forum took credit for getting in contact with Edwards and pushing for her official recognition of Hamas’ psychological terrorism. Its law department also helped achieve Israel’s only other victory at the UN, which has consistently refused to condemn Hamas and regularly equates Hamas’ slaughter of 1,200 people on October 7 with Israeli attempts at self-defense. After a great deal of urging by the Forum and others horrified by Israel’s proof of the terrorists’ rapes, gang rapes and sexualized torture of many victims, Pramila Patten, special representative of the UN secretary-general on sexual violence in conflict, visited Israel with a whole team of investigators. After interviewing victims, their families, first responders, doctors and forensic specialists, she issued a report last March that unequivocally confirmed that Hamas used sexual violence during the October 7 attack and sexually assaulted hostages as well. Edwards’ report will be presented at an event that will include senior UN officials and representatives of the hostages’ families.

Trump to Congress: ‘We’re bringing hostages back from Gaza’	President Trump touts return of hostages during ceasefire deal in address to joint session of Congress, says his administration will expand Abraham Accords in Mideast. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress Tuesday, touting the return of hostages from the Gaza Strip during the six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. During the address, which was attended by several released hostages from Gaza and the families of a number of freed captives, Trump made no mention of the invitees, but did highlight the return of 33 hostages, including 25 living captives. 'In the Middle East, we’re bringing back our hostages from Gaza,' Trump said. The president also vowed that his administration would expand upon the Abraham Accords, initiated in 2020, but declined to provide details. 'A lot of things are happening in the Middle East,' the president hinted. 'In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords. And now we’re going to build on that foundation, to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.' Trump urged Congress to fund the creation of a missile defense network comparable to Israel's Iron Dome system, comparing his plan to Ronald Reagan's aspiration to create a laser defense network, dubbed the Strategic Defense Initiative, capable of destroying ballistic missiles aimed at the U.S. 'As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future,' Trump continued. 'As a first step, I’m asking Congress to fund a state of the art 'golden dome' missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the U.S.A. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn’t there. Not even close. But now we have the technology.' 'And other places have it. Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right?'

IAF drone strike kills top Hezbollah naval commander	Images of an upside, burning car posted online by Lebanese media outlets showed the aftermath of the strike. By World Israel News Staff A Hezbollah naval commander planning attacks against the Jewish State was assassinated in a drone strike, the Israeli Air Force confirmed in a statement. Hather Said Hashem was the officer responsible for the naval operations of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, according to the Israeli military. 'Hashem’s activities were a threat to the State of Israel and its citizens, and blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,' the army added in the statement. The IDF posted a video of the strike on its official X account, which targeted Hashem's vehicle as he drove near Tyre, Lebanon. Images of an upside, burning car posted online by Lebanese media outlets showed the aftermath of the strike. As of March 2025, a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon is still in effect. Under the terms of the agreement, Israel may take action against terrorists who pose an imminent threat to its security. In mid-February, IDF troops withdrew from southern Lebanon, with the exception of five key border outposts. Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israel would maintain a presence in the region for the time being. 'There is a buffer zone. It wasn't easy but I stood my ground, and we received a green light from the United States. We gave them a map, and we are staying indefinitely – this is situation-dependent, not time-dependent,' Katz said at a defense conference, in a summary of his remarks released by his office. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the areas in Lebanon where IDF soldiers remain 'strategic high points' that are 'necessary for our security.' Saar said that Israel would 'temporarily' remain at those outposts, until 'Lebanon fully implements its side of the deal.' Under the agreement, Lebanon must clear its southern border region with Israel of all Hezbollah operatives - a task which it is likely incapable of achieving.

Overturning Biden-era decision, Marco Rubio blacklists Houthis as...	Secretary of State restores terrorist designation for the pro-Iranian Houthi movement in Yemen, reversing the whitelisting by the Biden administration. By World Israel News Staff The United States State Department on Tuesday blacklisted the Yemenite Houthi movement, restoring its designation as a terrorist organization. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the blacklisting, more than a month after President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing the State Department to put the pro-Iranian group back on the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list. 'The Houthis' activities threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade,' Rubio said, referencing Houthi missile attacks on Israel and the targeting of ships passing through the Red Sea. 'The United States will not tolerate any country engaging with terrorist organizations like the Houthis in the name of practicing legitimate international business.' At the end of President Trump's first term in office, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added the Houthi group Ansar Allah to the FTO, after it allied itself with the Hamas terror organization. Pompeo's successor, Antony Blinken, reversed the move in February 2021, dropping Ansar Allah from the State Department's terror blacklist. The Biden administration did place the Houthis on a separate terror blacklist, the Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) list, in January 2024, following a spate of attacks by Houthi terrorists on ships passing through the Red Sea. However, the SDGT listing provided limited tools for sanctioning the Houthis in comparison to the FTO listing. On January 22nd, Trump called for Ansar Allah to be put back on the FTO blacklist. 'Under President Trump, it is now the policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the Houthis’ capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and thereby end their attacks on US personnel and civilians, US partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea,' the White House said in a press release.

Father of Nova Festival victim commits suicide	Vladislav Bongart, 48, took his own life some 16 months after his daughter Sofia was murdered in music festival massacre. By World Israel News Staff The father of a young woman who was murdered at the Nova Festival on October 7th, 2023, committed suicide last week, some 16 months after his daughter's slaying. Sofia Bongart, 21, was murdered in the terror onslaught. A resident of Karmiel in northern Israel, she had told her parents, Anna and Vladislav, that she was going to a rave in the western Negev region. She attended the festival with her best friend since childhood, Liraz Nisan, who was also murdered that day. 'Sofia was a mature and responsible girl, and I always trusted her and never worried. She traveled a lot, and my only concern was road safety. We had an agreement that she would always update me when she reached her destination. At 6 a.m., when they got to Nova, she texted me: ‘I arrived,’' Anna told Hebrew-language news outlet Walla. Within minutes of their arrival, Hamas launched a major barrage of rockets, sending attendees scrambling for cover. 'People around them were told to lie on the ground and wait for it to be over. She trusted the army so much,' Anna said. Bongart eventually sought refuge from the rocket barrage in a roadside bomb shelter near Kibbutz Be'eri. Hamas terrorists threw grenades and opened fire into the structure, killing Bongart's friend Nisan. According to the report, Bongart made a desperate attempt to flee to safety, and was shot dead by terrorists once she left the bomb shelter. In her final message to her mother and father, sent around 8 a.m., Bongart wrote told her parents that she was blessed to have them and that she loved them. Her father, Vladislav, was devastated by her death. Twice a week, he brought flowers to her grave. 'We put on a mask and carried our pain, but Vladislav never shared what he was going through,' she said. Anna said that her husband did not tell acquaintances about his daughter's murder. 'He didn’t want people looking at him with pity,' she said. 'He refused help and was consumed from within. But I never feared he would harm himself.' Vladislav took his own life at home in Karmiel in late February, at the age of 48. The family has one surviving daughter, Evalina.

Israeli students outraged after prof. calls IDF soldiers ‘baby-ki...	Letter to Ben Gurion University administration demands firing of professor who says IDF troops execute infants. By World Israel News Staff More than one thousand Israeli students at Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba are calling for the firing of a professor, who claimed on social media that IDF soldiers murder infants. Dr. Sebastian Ben-Daniel, a computer science lecturer who uses the moniker John Brown on X, has made a number of incendiary comments against the Israeli military in recent weeks. Statements from Ben-Daniel's account include 'IDF soldiers are baby killers because they were raised to be baby killers,' and that 'IDF soldiers are murderers' whom only 'The Hague can hold the accountable.' 'We, the signatories of the attached letter, students at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, condemn and oppose the defamatory and unfounded statements that accuse us and our military comrades of infanticide,' read a letter demanding Ben-Daniel's firing, written by the Zionist watchdog group Im Tirtzu. The letter was signed by 1,153 students. 'On October 7, we enlisted to defend the State of Israel and its citizens after the terrible massacre carried out by the terrorist organization Hamas,' the letter continued. 'We will not agree to the continued employment of a lecturer who echoes anti-Semitic propaganda. We call on you, the university president, to dismiss him immediately.' Ben-Gurion University President Professor Daniel Haimovitch responded to the letter on his Facebook page, stating that the school was taking the matter seriously. 'Unfortunately, in recent days the university has found itself at the heart of a public storm following the exposure of the offensive and false statements of an outside lecturer against IDF soldiers,' Haimovitch wrote. 'These are offensive, libelous statements that deeply hurt our students, our faculty and all members of our community/ We have forwarded the matter to the relevant authorities for further processing. From now on, the duty of responsibility for his actions and their meaning lies with him&#8230; We cannot - and will not - remain silent in the face of statements of this kind.' Notably, the statement did not specify possible consequences for Ben-Daniel, including whether he would be fired. 'Dr. Ben Daniel is invited to move to teach at Berkeley or Columbia University in the U.S., where his antisemitic views will be accepted,' Ernest Ivanitzky, student coordinator for Im Tirtzu at Ben-Gurion University, said in a media statement. 'He has no place in Israeli academia, he should be fired immediately. His statements are a slap in the face of the students who are forced to study with him. A disgrace.'

Trump will pull funding from campuses that don’t crack down on ‘i...	All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.' By Ben Sales, JTA President Donald Trump threatened to pull funding from campuses that permit 'illegal protests,' said he would deport foreigners involved in those protests and appeared to endorse a ban on masks at demonstrations. The threat, made on social media, came a day after his administration said it was considering stopping more than $50 million in federal contracts with Columbia University over its 'ongoing inaction in the face of relentless harassment of Jewish students.' Columbia has faced bipartisan criticism after pro-Palestinian protesters recently occupied a building at Barnard College and injured a school employee. The president published the post hours before his speech to Congress on Tuesday. 'All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests,' he wrote on Truth Social. 'Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS! Thank you for your attention to this matter.' The post repeated a number of threats or pledges Trump made during his presidential campaign and since taking office in January. He has repeatedly taken aim at schools’ funding, either by threatening massive fines or a cut to federal grants. An executive order he signed instructed the administration to take 'actions to remove' non-citizen students who endorse terrorism. In endorsing a mask ban, Trump has joined a coalition of organizations pushing such measures in New York City and elsewhere. Proponents say mask bans at public gatherings prevent people from shielding their identity while breaking the law or harassing others. Opponents of the bans say they contravene free speech and the right to protest. Legislation banning 'masked harassment' has been introduced in New York’s state legislature. A number of Jewish groups support the mask ban, and Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt touted the idea at the group’s conference this week.

Arab leaders accept Egyptian plan for Gaza, oppose Trump’s ‘Gaza ...	Egypt, Jordan, and Gulf Arab states fear Trump's plan for an exodus of Palestinians and a US rebuild of Gaza would destabilize the entire region. By Algemeiner, WIN and Reuters Arab leaders adopted an Egyptian reconstruction plan for Gaza on Tuesday that would cost $53 billion and avoid displacing Palestinians from the enclave, in contrast to US President Donald Trump’s 'Middle East Riviera' vision. Egypt’s Reconstruction Plan for Gaza is a 112-page document that includes maps of how its land would be re-developed and dozens of colorful AI-generated images of housing developments, gardens and community centers. The plan includes a commercial harbor, a technology hub, beach hotels, and an airport. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said the proposal, welcomed in subsequent statements by Hamas and criticized by Israel, had been accepted at the closing of a summit in Cairo. Sisi said at the summit that he was certain Trump would be able to achieve peace in the conflict that has devastated the Gaza Strip. The major questions that need to be answered about Gaza’s future are who will run the enclave and which countries will provide the billions of dollars needed for reconstruction. Sisi said Egypt had worked in cooperation with Palestinians on creating an administrative committee of independent, professional Palestinian technocrats entrusted with the governance of Gaza after the end of the war. The committee would be responsible for the oversight of humanitarian aid and managing the Strip’s affairs for a temporary period, in preparation for the return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), he said. The other critical issue is the fate of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, the PA’s rival, which triggered the Gaza war by attacking Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. The Islamist faction that has run Gaza since 2007 said in a statement it agrees to the Egyptian committee proposal. Hamas has agreed it will not field candidates to the Cairo-proposed committee, but it would have to give its consent to the tasks, members and the agenda of the committee that would work under the PA’s supervision. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said late on Tuesday the names for the individuals participating in the committee had been decided. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the PA, said he welcomed the Egyptian idea and urged Trump to support such a plan that would not involve displacing Palestinian residents. Abbas, in power since 2005, also said he was ready to hold presidential and parliamentary elections if circumstances allowed, adding his PA was the only legitimate governing and military force in the Palestinian Territories. Hamas said it welcomed the elections. Abbas has seen his legitimacy steadily undermined by Israeli settlement building in the West Bank, which he oversees. Many Palestinians now regard his administration as corrupt, undemocratic, and out of touch. The Israeli foreign ministry in a statement called the plan 'rooted in outdated perspectives' and rejected the reliance on the PA while complaining that Hamas was left in power by the plan. Any reconstruction funding would require heavy buy-in from oil-rich Gulf Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which have the billions of dollars needed. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa said the reconstruction fund would seek international financing as well as oversight and likely be located in the World Bank. The UAE, which sees Hamas and other Islamists as an existential threat, wants an immediate and complete disarmament of the group, while other Arab countries advocate a gradual approach, a source close to the matter said. A source close to Saudi Arabia’s royal court says the continued armed presence of Hamas in Gaza was a stumbling block because of strong objections from the United States and Israel, which would need to sign off on any plan. In a speech at the summit, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan said international guarantees were needed that the current temporary ceasefire would remain in place and supported the PA’s role in governing the strip. Leaders of the UAE and Qatar did not speak during open sessions of the summit. Hamas was founded in 1987 by Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian Intifada, or uprising. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri on Tuesday rejected Israeli and US calls for the group to disarm, saying its right to resist was not negotiable. Abu Zuhri told Reuters the group would not accept any attempt to impose projects, or any form of non-Palestinian administration or the presence of foreign forces. Since Hamas drove the Palestinian Authority out of Gaza after a brief civil war in 2007, it has crushed all opposition there. Egypt, Jordan, and Gulf Arab states have for almost a month been consulting over an alternative to Trump’s ambition for an exodus of Palestinians and a US rebuild of Gaza, which they fear would destabilize the entire region. Israel was unlikely to oppose an Arab entity taking responsibility for Gaza’s government if Hamas was off the scene, said a source familiar with the matter. But an Israeli official told Reuters that Israel‘s war aims from the beginning have been to destroy Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. 'Therefore, if they are going to get Hamas to agree to demilitarize, it needs to be immediately. Nothing else will be acceptable,' the official said.

Netanyahu: 'Furthermore, the Shin Bet director deemed it unnecessary to wake the prime minister on the night of the attack, despite it being the most critical and fundamental decision imaginable.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following the release of Shin Bet's probe into Hamas's October 7th attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the agency for failing to inform him of Hamas's plans to attack Israel. In a statement, Netanyahu said, 'The intelligence picture was misinterpreted, leading to a flawed perception.' 'In the ongoing intelligence assessments, including just days before the massacre, the Shin Bet's central thesis was that Hamas aimed to maintain calm and that no escalation was expected,' the statement continued. The prime minister's statement responded to Shin Bet’s probe, which suggested that government policies were partly to blame for Hamas's decision to carry out their attack plans. Shin Bet stated that government policies regarding the Temple Mount, the treatment of Palestinian prisoners, and the judicial overhaul were likely contributing factors to Hamas's decision to attack Israel. Netanyahu continued in his statement, 'Bar firmly stated that Hamas aimed to avoid a confrontation with Israel. He even believed there was potential for long-term stability in Gaza if Israel offered a positive economic outlook,' the statement said. 'Most alarming of all, the Shin Bet and its director failed to address, even at the most basic level, the 'Walls of Jericho' plan to destroy Israel,' Netanyahu’s statement added. 'This was neither included in the ongoing intelligence assessments nor considered on the night of October 7, despite the fact that the Shin Bet had been aware of the plan since 2018,' the statement continued. 'Furthermore, the Shin Bet director deemed it unnecessary to wake the prime minister on the night of the attack, despite it being the most critical and fundamental decision imaginable,' it said. Shin Bet acknowledged its failures in its October 7th probe, including: failing to warn the public about Hamas's plans to attack, misunderstanding Hamas’s intentions, failing to recognize Hamas as having a military and instead viewing them solely as a terror group, and the belief that terrorists were planning a major attack in Judea and Samaria rather than Israel's southern border communities.

Hostage seeks to return religious books to soldier who left them ...	Freed hostage Omer Shem Tov recited 'Kiddush' (Sabbath sanctification) with grape juice he received while in captivity. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During his captivity in Gaza, Omer Shem Tov read a Chabad religious booklet and Tehillim (Psalms) left behind by soldiers, his parents told Channel 13. The Chabad booklet, Dvar Malchus, which contained religious texts for weekly study, belonged to a soldier named Yoel Elbaz. The family said they are trying to locate the soldier to express their gratitude. Shem Tov also found a copy of Tehillim, Chapter 100, and read a Hebrew translation of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest five times. Omer’s father, Malki, told Israel National News that his son fought against the odds to maintain his religious observance during captivity. Shem Tov recited Kiddush (Sabbath sanctification) with grape juice he received while in captivity. Malki Shem Tov commented, 'These things really gave him strength. The faith, knowing that he was being watched over from above, helped him survive.' Despite the meager rations, Omer Shem Tov wanted to fast on Yom Kippur but didn’t know the date. He realized that the Israeli radio station he had been allowed to listen to had gone silent, which meant it was Yom Kippur. He expressed disappointment that he hadn’t known ahead of time so he could have fasted. 'We never lost hope or faith; we stayed positive, even during the hardest times,' he said. 'There were certainly challenges along the way, but we always knew Omer would come home. He shared with us that throughout his entire captivity, he held onto the certainty that he would return. Despite the unimaginable hardships he endured, he never once lost hope or faith.' Freed hostage and IDF soldier Agam Berger discovered a book by Rabbi Haim Druckman in Gaza and consulted it to determine whether one could eat nonkosher meat in life-threatening situations. The book, which had been distributed in Bnei Akiva yeshivas and girls' high schools, was accidentally left behind by an IDF soldier. Berger, who maintained her Jewish observance during captivity, said that after reading the book, she learned that she was permitted to eat nonkosher meat if her life was in danger.

Shem Tov made Kiddush with grape juice he received while in captivity. Malki Shem Tov commented, 'These things really gave him strength. The faith, knowing that he was being watched over from above, helped him survive.' Despite the meager rations, Omer Shem Tov wanted to fast on Yom Kippur but didn’t know the date. He realized that the Israeli radio station he had been allowed to listen to had gone silent, which meant it was Yom Kippur. He expressed disappointment that he hadn’t known ahead of time so he could have fasted. 'We never lost hope or faith; we stayed positive, even during the hardest times,' he said. 'There were certainly challenges along the way, but we always knew Omer would come home. He shared with us that throughout his entire captivity, he held onto the certainty that he would return. Despite the unimaginable hardships he endured, he never once lost hope or faith.' Freed hostage and IDF soldier Agam Berger discovered a book by Rabbi Haim Druckman in Gaza and consulted it to determine whether one could eat nonkosher meat in life-threatening situations. The book, which had been distributed in Bnei Akiva yeshivas and girls' high schools, was accidentally left behind by an IDF soldier. Berger, who maintained her Jewish observance during captivity, said that after reading the book, she learned that she was permitted to eat nonkosher meat if her life was in danger.

Air France denies deliberately mislabeling non-kosher meals on fl...	More troublingly, Air France has not indicated whether the flight attendant involved would face any consequences or if staff would receive additional training on respecting religious dietary requirements. By Jewish Breaking News Air France is facing scrutiny after a flight attendant allegedly labeled regular meals as kosher and served them to a Jewish family on a flight from Mauritius to Paris last month. Traveling with eight family members, including children as young as 3 and an elderly relative of 73, Divora Marinelli had ordered kosher meals in advance for their 12-hour flight. Upon check-in, the family was informed their kosher meals wouldn’t be available. Already facing a long journey without proper food, they boarded the plane resigned to hunger, she tells DansDeals. What happened next went beyond mere inconvenience. After takeoff, flight attendants served the family meals with 'KSML' written on them—the standard industry abbreviation for kosher meals. But Marinelli quickly realized something was wrong. The meals weren’t kosher at all. Instead, a flight attendant had apparently taken regular meal trays and simply written 'KSML' on them, presenting them as kosher-compliant. By the time Marinelli discovered the deception, some of her children had already begun eating the non-kosher food. Her son had even directly asked a flight attendant if his meal was kosher, to which the attendant reportedly confirmed it was. Marinelli immediately alerted the lead flight attendant, who investigated the situation. According to Marinelli, the supervisor confirmed that another crew member had indeed marked regular meals as kosher and distributed them to the family under false pretenses. The lead flight attendant then proceeded to document the incident in an official report. According to DansDeals, the airline’s response has been minimal. Each affected family member received a 30 Euro voucher as compensation. More troublingly, Air France has not indicated whether the flight attendant involved would face any consequences or if staff would receive additional training on respecting religious dietary requirements. When the story gained traction on social media, Air France issued a statement claiming otherwise. 'Due to a supply shortage at the local caterer, customers were informed when they arrived at the airport that their special meals would be unavailable and that vegetarian product trays would be provided as a replacement. Once on board, these trays were served to them, marked by the local caterer KSML, purely so that they could be identified by the crew to facilitate service,' the Airline wrote on X. 'Air France regrets this confusing identification and points out that the crew never intended to mislead customers about the quality of the tray offered and that customers were well aware of the vegetarian meal served.' However, Marinelli firmly says she was 'absolutely not informed' that a vegetarian product would be offered and would have refused that, noting that other religious Jews were on the flight as well. She also disputed Air France’s claim about unintentional mislabeling, referencing the report filed by the lead flight attendant. When asked by DansDeals whether they would provide a copy of the report, Air France responded, 'We do not have any further comments beyond the statement we shared.'

Israeli army restricts soldiers’ social media use following Oct. ...	The investigation found that photos shared by soldiers on their first and last days in their roles allowed Hamas to create a detailed model of the Nahal Oz base. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israel Defense Forces is moving to tighten restrictions on soldiers’ social media use after an internal probe revealed that Hamas exploited online posts to map out Nahal Oz base before its October 7 attack. During the October 7 attack on Nahal Oz, 53 soldiers were killed and 10 more were taken captive. New measures include a ban on photography inside IDF facilities, strict penalties for violations, and security classifications for a wider range of military roles. Soldiers and officers in various positions will also be prohibited from using Facebook and other platforms to prevent intelligence leaks. Additionally, the army will restrict the public from filming civilian-attended ceremonies and events. The investigation found that photos shared by soldiers on their first and last days in their roles allowed Hamas to create a detailed model of the base. This intelligence enabled the group to locate generators, surveillance cameras, safe rooms, the coordination center, patrol movements, and the sleeping quarters of commanders. While the probe noted that Hamas was also able to gather intelligence on Nahal Oz using drones and from the news media, investigators found that soldiers left enough indicators on social media to give Hamas an almost complete breakdown of the base ahead of the October 7 attack. Palestinians captured during the war told interrogators they were even able to build models of parts of Nahal Oz for training. Investigators also found that soldiers at Nahal Oz received no warning before the attack. Protocols did not address responding to rocket fire or protecting unarmed non-combat soldiers, and that drills simulating a ground assault had not taken place in years. According to a series of army probes — summaries of which were released publicly on Thursday — some 5,000 terrorists from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad managed to attack numerous Israeli communities and overrun the army’s border positions. The army’s chain of command broke amid the chaos and soldiers were outnumbered. For years, the army misunderstood Hamas’s intentions, and as October 7 approached, intelligence about the looming attack was misinterpreted. The military was also more focused on threats from Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah in Lebanon. The army’s probes only deal with issues of operations, intelligence and command, not decisions made by the political echelon. There have been growing calls for the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to investigate political and military failures. Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. They may include personal recommendations about individuals under investigation, though the government is not bound to act on them. Pressed by lawmakers to explain why no state commission of inquiry has been established into the failures of October 7 after 17 months Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he opposed a 'politically biased' panel. His remarks were marred by scuffles that broke out between bereaved families and Knesset guards. The last state commission of inquiry, which investigated Israel’s worst civilian disaster — a stampede that killed 45 people at a holy site on Mount Meron — held Netanyahu personally responsible for the tragedy in a report released in April. At least 1,180 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 59 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

Israel: Hamas has ‘a few days’ to agree to extended truce	If no ceasefire extension is reached, the plan is to conquer the Gaza Strip with more than 50,000 soldiers, relocating the civilian population to humanitarian zones and waging a 'ruthless ground campaign.' By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS The Hamas terror organization only has 'a few days' to agree to a U.S.-proposed ceasefire extension, an Israeli government spokesman confirmed on Tuesday. 'If they don’t, the Cabinet will convene and decide on the next steps,' Omer Dostri, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s spokesman, told Israel’s Army Radio. The Security Cabinet, which is responsible for defense-related decisions and composed of senior ministers, is scheduled to meet on Sunday at 4 p.m., the Ynet outlet reported on Tuesday, noting that the forum would convene only after Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir was sworn in as the 24th chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces. Jerusalem is developing a plan to resume the war in the Strip in four to six weeks in a decisive campaign to wipe out Hamas, The Washington Free Beacon reported on Friday, citing several current and former Israeli officials. Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed Zamir to develop the plan, which is projected for completion when he enters office on Thursday, according to the report. The plan is to conquer the entire Gaza Strip in one fell swoop with more than 50,000 soldiers, relocating the civilian population to humanitarian zones and waging a 'ruthless ground campaign' in terrorist-heavy areas that will receive no humanitarian aid, according to the Beacon. The campaign is to commence with a heavy aerial assault, followed by a reduction of aid entering the Strip. IDF divisions would simultaneously enter the Strip in the north, center and south, carving it into three parts. The campaign could be paused if the Hamas leadership agrees to free captives, or if it disarms and goes into exile, the report added. Israeli assessments indicate that Palestinian terrorist groups in the Strip are still holding 59 hostages. Of these, 24 are believed to be alive—all men—while 35, including three women, are believed to be deceased. Two of the living hostages and three of the deceased are foreign nationals. Phase 1 of the ceasefire, which went into effect on Jan. 19, formally expired at midnight on Saturday. Jerusalem subsequently announced it had suspended all humanitarian aid after Hamas rejected U.S. Mideast envoy Witkoff’s plan to extend the temporary ceasefire deal during the Ramadan and Passover period. 'Saturday was the last day of the first phase of the framework for the release of our hostages. Israel has fully implemented its part, including the part of humanitarian aid, fully and down to the last day,' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told international media on Tuesday. He noted that Israel had agreed to the U.S. bridging proposal, but that 'unfortunately, Hamas rejected the offer. Accordingly, Israel stopped enabling the entry of aid into Gaza.' Any aid that ends up in the hands of Hamas 'is not humanitarian,' charged the foreign minister. 'Unfortunately, Hamas’s takeover of goods turned it into an economic engine for them. It became the number one budget income for Hamas in Gaza. They use that money for terror, to restore terror capabilities and get more young terrorists to join their organization.' Not content with appropriating the aid, 'They are shooting the civilians who try to get access to the aid. They use it as an engine in their war against Israel,' Jerusalem’s top diplomat added, declaring: 'This can not continue and will not continue.'

Shuli Har-Melech, 25, and his wife were returning home to Homesh when they were ambushed by five terrorists with automatic weapons who killed Shuli and critically wounded pregnant Limor. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli Knesset member Limor Son Har-Melech was not informed by the authorities that the terrorist who murdered her husband in 2003 was being released as part of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, she revealed on Tuesday. Speaking at the Knesset with the families of hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, the lawmaker said, 'This morning, I woke up to the news that the terrorist who murdered my husband was released. No one likes this. I listen and understand and am in pain in a way that I cannot describe to you.' HaKol HaYehudi reporter Elchanan Groner revealed earlier on Tuesday that Muaid Hamad, convicted for multiple murders, including those of Shalom 'Shuli' Har-Melech and Esther Galia, was in the second wave of prisoners released by Israel as part of the ceasefire. פשוט טירוף: מחבלים שוחררו ומשפחות הנרצחים לא עודכנו אפילו.במהלך הלילה במסגרת מחקר על משוחררי העסקה גיליתי שמואיד חמאד הוא אחד המשוחררים בעסקה האחרונה (שוחרר בפעימה השניה).חמאד רצח את שולי הר מלך ופצע קשה את רעייתו @limor_sonhrmelh , רצח את אסתר גאליה, דוד ציון ועוד שלושה חיילים… pic.twitter.com/ykV1GmCLl6 &mdash; אלחנן גרונר (@elchanangr) March 4, 2025 The Israel Defense Forces killed Khaled Najjar, another of the terrorists involved in the Aug. 28, 2003 murder of Shuli Har-Melech, in Rafah in May of last year.

IDF kills terrorist who opened fire at Samaria checkpoint	Overnight Monday, Israeli forces killed the head of the Hamas terror network in the northern Samaria city of Jenin. By JNS Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian terrorist who opened fire at an army checkpoint near the Jewish community of Homesh in northern Samaria, the Israel Defense Forces said. 'A short time ago, a terrorist fired at an IDF force at a checkpoint near the village of Burqa in the Samaria Brigade [deployment area]. Forces responded by firing at the terrorist and killing him,' the IDF stated. No Israeli troops were hurt in the attempted attack, it added. At the same time, the Hatzalah Judea and Samaria rescue group said that soldiers were conducting searches after gunfire was reported near the town of Nili, located in western Samaria close to the city of Modi’in.

Report: Russian missile experts visited Iran ahead of ballistic m...	Senior Russian missile experts visited Iran twice last year, according to analysis of travel records. By World Israel News Staff Russia has deepened its ties to Iran’s production of missiles over the past year, according to a report by Reuters. Based on an analysis of travel records, the report found that two delegations of senior Russian missile specialists traveled to Iran over the past. Documents cited by the report show that seven Russian weapons experts traveled from Moscow to Tehran on two separate occasions, April 24 and September 17, 2024. Passenger manifests and booking records indicate that six of the seven carried official state business passports, a designation used by government officials and military personnel abroad. The exact purpose of these visits remains unclear. However, both trips took place just weeks before major Iranian attacks on Israel, on April 14 and October 1. Following the Iranian offensives, Israeli counterstrikes targeted Iranian air defenses, some of which were supplied by Russia. A senior Iranian defense ministry official stated that Russian missile specialists had made multiple visits to Iranian missile production sites, including underground facilities, last year. Some of these visits reportedly occurred in September, though the specific locations remain undisclosed. A Western defense official monitoring Iran-Russia defense relations confirmed to Reuters that an unspecified number of Russian missile experts visited an Iranian missile base near the port of Amirabad on the Caspian Sea coast in September. The seven Russian specialists identified in the records have extensive military backgrounds, with two holding the rank of colonel and two ranked as lieutenant colonels. Their expertise spans air-defense missile systems, artillery, rocketry, advanced weapons development, and missile testing. However, employment records reviewed by Reuters range from 2021 to 2024, leaving uncertainty about their current roles. When contacted by phone, five of the identified individuals denied traveling to Iran or working for the military, while another declined to comment and one disconnected the call. The revelations underscore growing military collaboration between Russia and Iran, particularly in missile technology, at a time of heightened regional tensions and evolving geopolitical alliances.

Trump suspends weapons shipments to Ukraine following showdown wi...	According to Fox News, the suspension primarily affects previously approved aid not yet delivered as Trump has not given a penny to Ukraine since taking office. By Jewish Breaking News Following a dramatic showdown in the Oval Office last week with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, President Donald Trump has paused all weapons shipments to the war-torn country. The Ukrainian president was told to leave and 'come back when he is ready for peace' after Trump accused him of 'gambling with' a third world war. On Monday, Trump expressed fresh outrage at Zelensky for suggesting the war’s end could be 'very, very far away.' 'This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer!' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelensky, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the US. Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?' Trump’s warnings became more explicit when speaking with reporters. 'It should not be that hard a deal to make. It could be made very fast,' he said. 'Now, maybe somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, and if somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, I think that person won’t be around very long.' Hours later, the White House announced the suspension of all US military aid to Ukraine. 'The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,' the White House statement reads. According to Fox News, the suspension primarily affects previously approved aid not yet delivered as Trump has not given a penny to Ukraine since taking office. Congress has approved $175 billion in total assistance for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion nearly three years ago. In December, just before leaving office, Joe Biden announced an additional $5.9 billion in security and budget assistance. The aid has been crucial for Ukraine’s survival. Some American funds help pay teachers’ and doctors’ salaries and keep basic government functions running while the country fights Russian forces. In total, the US has pledged $31.7 billion worth of weapons through presidential drawdown authority, with most of it already shipped. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is looking to warm relations with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. State and Treasury departments have reportedly been ordered to draft lists of sanctions that could be lifted during upcoming talks with Russian officials over Ukraine’s fate.

UNRWA official calls aid agency a casualty of October 7 during Ha...	During his remarks, Abu Hasna said Israel used October 7 as an excuse 'to liquidate UNRWA' and push the international community into ditching the aid group. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon A spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) attended a Hamas-affiliated webinar last month alongside one of the terror group's operatives and claimed that officials with the embattled aid agency were 'also victims' of the October 7 terror rampage through Israel. Adnan Abu Hasna, an UNRWA media adviser, participated in a February 19 online briefing organized by the Lebanon-based advocacy group Association 302 for Palestinian Refugees. The organization is led by Ali Hweidi, who also serves as an official in the Popular Conference for Palestinians Abroad, a group that Israel designated as a Hamas front in 2021. The briefing, which also included a Hamas official, was broadcast on a media outlet linked to the terror group. Abu Hasna argued that UNRWA was also a casualty on the day Hamas slaughtered more than 1,200 Israelis in cold blood, an attack the terrorists carried out alongside more than a dozen UNRWA employees. The aid group's participation on October 7 prompted international donors, including the United States, to temporarily pull their funding, leaving it scrambling for cash. The Trump administration permanently froze all U.S. funding to UNRWA shortly after taking office. 'At the end of the day, we at UNRWA were one of the victims of what happened on October 7,' Abu Hasna said in Arabic during the briefing, which was titled 'UNRWA After the Ban Law and the Arrival of Trump: Dangers and Coping Mechanisms.' It centered on ways the aid group and its supporters can sow divisions between the Trump administration and European countries that still support UNRWA's role as the chief humanitarian aid group in Gaza. Israel in January formally banned the aid group from operating, citing its role in the October 7 attack and longstanding concerns over its anti-Semitic educational materials. Speaking alongside UNRWA's Abu Hasna was Ahmed Al-Hajj, a Hamas official based in Lebanon, and Abdelhamid Siyam, a Rutgers University professor who formerly worked for the United Nations. Another participant, Saleh Abdel Ati, is a former member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a designated terror group. Abu Hasna's participation in the briefing did not raise any red flags with UNRWA, even as the agency tries to rehabilitate its image in the wake of October 7. In the months after the war in Gaza broke it, Israel revealed that scores of UNRWA employees are card-carrying Hamas foot soldiers. Hamas also used UNRWA-run facilities, including hospitals, to hide weapons, transport hostages, and plan further terror attacks on Israel. Abu Hasna, an UNRWA spokesman told the Washington Free Beacon, 'is permitted to participate in public events to clarify the agency's position. Participation in events does not endorse the organizers' position, nor their political affiliation.' During his remarks, Abu Hasna said Israel used October 7 as an excuse 'to liquidate UNRWA' and push the international community into ditching the aid group. Israel, he claimed, 'began to talk openly about the need to liquidate UNRWA' and spent more than $150 million on a supposed 'counter-media' initiative meant 'to distort the image of UNRWA.' 'If you type UNRWA in Google now, search engines direct you to something that resembles that this is a terrorist organization,' he lamented. An independent U.N. investigation determined that UNRWA employees did in fact participate in the October 7 attacks. The agency fired nine officials as a result. Abu Hasna during the briefing acknowledged this investigation but said only that 'some people may have participated.' Elsewhere in the briefing, Hamas official Al-Hajj advocated for sowing divisions between Europe and the Trump administration in a bid to keep international dollars flowing into UNRWA. The briefing was broadcast on Facebook and presented by the European Palestinian Media Center, a media outlet once helmed by Dutch activist Amin Abou Rashed. Dutch authorities arrested Rashed and his daughter in 2023 for allegedly raising millions of dollars for Hamas.

‘There are degrees of hell in hell’ – freed hostage’s parents spe...	Starved of food and companionship, Omer Shem Tov used his faith and mental toughness to survive Hamas captivity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Starved of food and companionship, Omer Shem Tov used his faith and emotional strength to survive Hamas captivity, his parents told Channel 13 in an interview Monday. Omer was kidnapped from the Nova dance festival during Hamas's October 7, 2023, invasion, along with two friends, Maya and Itay Regev. They remained together until the brother and sister were released in the first hostage deal, which occurred in late November that year. He didn’t see another friendly face for the next 13 months, and for a whopping 50 days, he was in complete isolation, his parents, Shelly and Malki, said. The terrorists put him in a very deep tunnel that was pitch dark and so low he couldn’t stand up, and so narrow he couldn’t stretch his arms out, they said. 'They gave him a flashlight and a just a tiny bit of food and sea water, and left him there,' Malki said. He had to ration himself, eating at first two pitot a day, then one, then a half, then just a cookie, because he didn't know how long he'd be there. 'Mom, I was so thin I could feel my bones,' Shelly recounted him telling her. Then the battery in the flashlight died, and for five days, he was 'in total, utter darkness,' Malki said. 'On the fifth day, he spoke to God,' Shelly said, 'praying, ‘Please, God, get me out of here, it doesn’t matter to where,’ and he said that two hours later his captor came.' The Hamas terrorists took him to a wider tunnel, one tiled with white tiles, which seemed like real light to him. 'Even in hell there seem to be degrees of hell,' his father remarked with a small chuckle. The Shem Tovs spoke about Omer’s faith and how it helped him. Once, when he saw a terrorist using his prayer beads, they said, 'Omer told him, ‘Come, I’ll teach you something else: ‘God was, is, and will always be king,’' a common line in Jewish prayer, said especially on the holidays. His captors also gave him a book on the weekly Torah readings that a Jewish soldier had left behind, 'which he’d like to return' now, the Shem Tovs said with a smile, as the man’s name was written on it. 'He also received Psalm 100,' Shelly said, 'which I would read all the time here&#8230; and he read this psalm in captivity every day.' 'It’s unbelievable,' she said, marveling at the coincidence. Omer also told his parents that he never showed fear to his captors, knowing that if he did, 'they would take advantage of it.' This included when IDF tanks rumbled right over his tunnel, shaking the ground, and he could even hear soldiers speaking in Hebrew – and his captors told him, his parents said, that if they got too close or attempted a rescue, 'they would shoot him in the head.' Shelly, who sat by Omer’s bedside the entire first night that he returned, not sleeping and just holding his hand and watching him breathe, said that the word 'joy' has a different meaning for her now. Instead of 'waking up in fear every morning&#8230; it’s opening your eyes and saying, ‘Wow. Wow,’' she recounted with a huge smile and sparkling eyes. Seeing him for the first time in 505 days and hugging him fiercely 'was really like giving birth to my child again,' she said.

Putin to broker nuclear talks with Iran – report	Russian president Vladimir Putin reportedly agrees to request by President Donald Trump to help facilitate talks with Tehran on Iran's nuclear program and support for terror groups. By World Israel News Staff Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to aid the Trump administration in bringing Tehran to the negotiating table on a number of key issues, including Iran's nuclear aspirations, according to a report Tuesday by Bloomberg. President Donald Trump reportedly requested that his Russian counterpart help facilitate talks between the U.S. and Iran, acting as an intermediary between the two countries. Trump is said to have proposed the arrangement during a call with Putin last month, while senior American officials reportedly raised the idea with Russian leaders in Saudi Arabia days after Trump's call to Putin. In particular, Trump requested that Putin help the U.S. initiate a dialogue with Tehran regarding the Iran nuclear program, a possible new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 agreement, as well as Iran's support for terrorist proxy groups across the Middle East including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Yemenite Houthis. The White House has not yet responded to the report. Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said Moscow supported talks between Iran and the U.S. and would be willing to help open a line of communication. 'Russia believes that the United States and Iran should resolve all problems through negotiations,' Peskov said, adding that Russia 'is ready to do everything in its power to achieve this.' On Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei neither confirmed nor denied that Russia had offered to broker talks with the U.S. 'Given the significance of these matters, it’s possible that many parties will show good will and readiness to help with various problems,' Baghaei said 'From this perspective, it’s natural that countries will present an offer of help if it’s needed.'

Israeli lawmakers urge repatriation of 100 children rescued from ...	Eligible for citizenship, they must be brought to Israel after the severe abuse they suffered at the hands of the Lev Tahor cult, MKs told. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Knesset Committee for Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs urged the government Monday to repatriate 100 of 160 children rescued in December from a Jewish cult in Guatemala who are seemingly eligible for Israeli citizenship. The other 60 are American and Canadian citizens. In the hearing, the MKs were told that the minors being held in various shelters in the Central American country, whose authorities raided the compound of the radical Lev Tahor sect after allegations of severe child abuse there prompted them to act. They will not be kept in the facilities much longer, however, and are in great danger of being returned to the cult if the Israeli government doesn’t act immediately, the aunt of four of the children told the Committee. 'The police in Guatemala did the hard work for the State of Israel, and now the government must complete the work and bring them to Israel,' said Orit Cohen Amir. 'If the Israeli government does not wake up, the children will return to experiencing mental, sexual and physical abuse.' Shas MK Yinon Azoulay agreed that the issue was urgent. 'The children in the cult are in danger of death,' he said, and the government must bring them to the country 'and ensur[e] they are in appropriate absorption frameworks.' This would need intense psychological treatment for the terrible sexual and physical traumas they have undergone, the MKs were told. The cult starves its members due to its twisted ideals of kashruth, it is 'forbidden to receive medical treatment,' cult survivor Amir Boyer attested, and 'there is no contact with the outside world.' It has been previously reported that Lev Tahor leaders have used even young girls in the group as their sex slaves, and Azoulay testified that 'within the cult there are children who are 13 years old who are already parents.' A legal representative of the families of those ensnared, Maya Nussbaum, said that if a rescue operation is not implemented, 'We fear that &#8230; the children will be smuggled to secret locations around the world as has been the case until now. The legal phase has already exhausted itself, now is the time for active actions to bring the survivors.' The children will have homes to go to, she noted, as 'We have submitted dozens of requests for guardianship to date.' MK Gilad Kariv, the Committee’s chairman, said that his group will be keeping a 'close' eye on the issue, as the State 'cannot remain indifferent' to the children who are residents of Israel and is 'obligated to work to return them to the country and provide them with protection - as we would do for any Israeli citizen who is in danger overseas.' In response, a representative of the Prime Minister's Office called it a 'complicated matter with many aspects and we are trying to understand all the details.' By contrast, an attorney from the Justice Ministry said, 'We have an excellent understanding of the international legal tools that need to be worked on &#8230; thanks to the Israeli delegation that went to Guatemala.' 'The children are currently not under the effective control of the cult, and this allows us to use legal tools to bring them to Israel,' Yaakov Friedberg said, while noting that 33 guardianship orders have been ordered to date. Foreign Ministry officials noted that the ministry is 'in constant contact' with the Guatemalan authorities on the issue and that 'the State of Israel's involvement in the return of the children is clear and unequivocal.' Kariv demanded to receive by next week a 'clear directive from the Prime Minister’s Office' on 'how it intends to act on the issue,' including timetables on the children’s return.

Pro-annexation Israeli minister heads to US ahead of expected Tru...	Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announces trip to the US this week – as date of expected Trump announcement on future of Judea and Samaria nears. By World Israel News Staff A right-wing Israeli government minister announced he is flying to the U.S. for a meeting with his American counterpart, amid speculation President Donald Trump is poised to make a major announcement on the future of Judea and Samaria. On Tuesday, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) announced that he has departed for the U.S., where he will meet with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. 'The purpose of the visit is to strengthen the economic cooperation between Israel and the United States, promote joint economic initiatives, and deepen the strategic alliance between the countries,' Smotrich tweeted. 'In addition, I will emphasize in my meetings Israel’s resolute stance in the fight against terror and the need for clear American backing for the continuation of our security operations in the war.' 'This visit constitutes another building block in strengthening the strategic and economic ties between Jerusalem and Washington, stemming from a shared commitment to the stability and security of Israel and the entire region.' Notably, the timing of Smotrich’s visit coincides with the timing of an announcement by the Trump administration on Judea and Samaria, and Israel’s plans to apply sovereignty over part or all of the area. On February 5th, in response to questions regarding the future of Judea and Samaria and Israeli plans to extend sovereignty over the area, Trump said his administration hasn’t taken a position on it yet,' adding that the White House will be 'making an announcement probably on that very specific topic over the next four weeks.' Wednesday marks four weeks to the day since Trump’s comments hinting at an announcement on the issue. Smotrich, a former right-wing activist who cofounded the watchdog group Regavim to monitor illegal Arab construction in Israel, Judea, and Samaria, is a long-time supporter of extending Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. The Israeli government shelved its plans to annex parts of Judea and Samaria in 2020, in order to facilitate the signing of the Abraham Accords. According to then-U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, Israel committed to suspend its annexation plans until after the 2024 presidential election.

IDF hits Assad assets in northwestern Syria	Syrian media outlets earlier on Thursday night reported that an Israeli strike had hit an 'air defense base' belonging to Assad’s former army. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israeli fighter jets attacked a military site of Syria’s former Assad regime near Qardaha in northwestern Syria on Monday night in response to 'recent developments in the area,' the Israel Defense Forces said. 'The IDF continues to monitor developments in the area and will act as necessary in order to defend the citizens of the State of Israel,' the military said, confirming earlier local reports. The attack targeted 'a military site where weapons belonging to the previous Syrian regime were stored,' the statement added. It did not specify which developments prompted the strike. Syrian media outlets earlier on Thursday night reported that an Israeli strike had hit an 'air defense base' belonging to Assad’s former army. Since the fall of the Iranian- and Russian-backed Assad regime on Dec. 8, Israel has taken up positions inside and beyond the Golan Heights buffer zone, including on the strategic Syrian side of Mount Hermon. The Israeli Air Force has conducted hundreds of strikes on former Assad military assets to prevent them from falling into the hands of hostile forces. In a series of strikes last week, Israeli jets hit military targets throughout Syria’s southern region, including 'command centers and multiple sites containing weapons,' over the course of several hours, according to the IDF. In an address to new officers at an IDF graduation ceremony last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the Sunni jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, whose leaders rule Syria following the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime in December, that Israel 'will not allow forces of HTS or the new Syrian army to enter the territory south of Damascus.' The IDF 'will remain in the Hermon sector and the buffer zone [in the Syrian Golan Heights] indefinitely to protect our communities and thwart any threat,' he said.

‘Pre-Oct. 7 situation in Lebanon is no more’	Maj. Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser and ex-head of the IDF’s Military Intelligence Research Department, described the changes to the situation in the north as 'historic.' By Yaakov Lappin, JNS The Israel Defense Forces has fundamentally reshaped its enforcement policy against Hezbollah’s activities in Lebanon, marking a significant departure from the pre-war status quo, an IDF official told JNS on Monday. 'The guiding principle today is, the situation we were in before Oct. 6, [2023], where Hezbollah could erect a tent on the border and we would think about it, is no more,' said the official. In addition to retaining for the foreseeable future five positions in Lebanese territory following its withdrawal from Southern Lebanon as part of the Nov. 27, 2024 ceasefire with Lebanon, Israel has been working steadily to enforce the truce. It is aided in this effort by the fact that the Lebanese terrorist group has been severely weakened by its year-long war with the Jewish state. In the final months of the war in the north, the IDF destroyed an enormous number of Hezbollah facilities and weapons, targeted its senior and intermediate command levels and killed more than 4,000 Hezbollah terror operatives. Israel also attacked Hezbollah’s financial system and strongholds across Lebanon. The Shi’ite terror organization has been struggling to recover ever since. Lebanon has taken steps to prevent Iranian funds from being smuggled into the country to Hezbollah, while the IDF has been demonstrating its ability and willingness to turn actionable intelligence into strikes. On Wednesday, Feb. 26, the Israeli Air Force eliminated Mahran Ali Nasser al-Din, a significant member of Hezbollah’s Unit 4400. The IDF described Unit 4400 as 'responsible for smuggling weapons into Lebanese territory from Iran and its proxies, aiming to maximize Hezbollah’s weapons stockpiles. Since its establishment, Unit 4400 has established numerous smuggling routes along the Syria-Lebanon border.' Al-Din played a major role in these operations. 'This activity, which facilitates Hezbollah’s armament, constitutes a clear threat to the security of the State of Israel and violates the understandings reached between Israel and Lebanon,' the IDF said. The next day, on Feb. 27, the IDF announced that it had identified activity inside a Hezbollah observation post in the area of Aainata in southern Lebanon, in violation of the ceasefire, which requires that Hezbollah withdraw north of the Litani River. The IAF proceeded to strike the post. That same day, the IAF eliminated Hezbollah terrorist Mohammed Mahdi Ali Shaheen near Hermel. Shaheen had been coordinating terrorist transactions for the purchase of weapons on the Syria-Lebanon border since the understandings between Lebanon and Israel came into effect,' according to the IDF. Shaheen was part of Hezbollah’s Geographical Unit, which according to the Israeli military is responsible for the Beqaa area and had recently been involved in transporting weapons from Syria to Lebanon. His actions posed a serious threat, according to the IDF. Maj. Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser and ex-head of the IDF’s Military Intelligence Research Department, described the changes to the situation in the north as 'historic.' 'The situation in the north is totally different than when it was in the beginning of the war,' he said on Sunday during a call with reporters organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. For such dramatic changes to occur in so short a time is 'very rare,' he added. Following the collapse of the Assad regime in December, he continued, Hezbollah’s strategic position has fundamentally changed. For the first time in its history it now finds itself without a land bridge from Iran via Syria to Lebanon, he said. According to Col. (res.) Barak Ben-Zur, a former IDF Military Intelligence officer and ex-head of a research unit at the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet), the collapse of the Syrian regime was a massive blow to Hezbollah’s main backer, Iran. 'The Assad family regime made a strategic decision, since the signing of the Israel-Egypt peace agreement, to seek another regional pillar to replace Egypt—this was Iran,' he told JNS on Monday. That Iran 'did not deliver' is the most important takeaway from the situation, according to Amidror. Ben-Zur explained how since the 1980s Iran had established a regional array, building up Hezbollah and entrenching itself in Syria. That effort included bases, 'tactical forces, intelligence-gathering capabilities on Israel and a command-and-control system,' he said. 'All of this ended with the rise of the Sunni government and the expulsion of Assad and his supporters' from Syria, he added. 'This has created a strategic opportunity that alters reality and allows Israel to deepen Hezbollah’s isolation after a series of operations weakened its capabilities,' he continued. He warned, however, that Israel has not yet developed a fully coordinated strategic policy to reach this goal. 'The Israeli defense establishment must dedicate a staff study to this issue, as strategic opportunities are time-sensitive and can close after a period,' he told JNS. 'Alongside such a maneuver, preventing a renewal of the Iranian front within Syria is no less important a goal, and perhaps, more so,' he said. 'At this stage, it is difficult to point to Israeli focus on this issue, and the building of a strategic plan designed to fulfill these objectives.'

US defense chief backs Israeli buffer zones in Syria, Lebanon	US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks with Israeli Defense Minister, backing Netanyahu government's call to eliminate Hamas rule in Gaza, prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration's defense chief spoke by phone with his Israel counterpart Monday night, discussing regional threats, including Iran's nuclear program, the future of the Gaza Strip, and the U.S.-Israel alliance. In a statement released overnight, Pentagon Press Secretary John Ullyot said that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) spoke about bilateral interests, regional developments and opportunities, and security assistance priorities during their call. 'The Secretary reaffirmed that the United States remains 100 percent committed to Israel's security and emphasized the unbreakable bond that exists between the United States and Israel,' Ullyot said. 'Both leaders agreed that Iran remains a threat to regional security and agreed to work together on this challenge.' Hours later, Defense Minister Katz tweeted a summary of their conversation, claiming that Hegseth endorsed Israel's goal of 'eliminating' Hamas rule in the Gaza Strip and the need to return all of the 59 remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza. 'Great conversation with SecDef Pete Hegseth. I thanked him for the Donald Trump administration’s support in expediting military aid to Israel and its unwavering commitment to Israel’s security.' 'We agreed: All hostages must be brought home, and Hamas rule in Gaza must be eliminated. Iran remains the greatest threat to regional security – we will work together to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons.' During their call, Hegseth also gave his backing for the IDF's ongoing counter-terror operation in Samaria, as well as the establishment of Israeli buffer zones inside southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan Heights. 'The defense minister briefed the defense secretary about IDF operations in Judea and Samaria against terror in refugee camps, and emphasized the importance of security zones in Lebanon and Syria, and thanked him for the backing,' the Defense Ministry said Monday.

‘There are degrees of hell in hell’ – freed hostage’s parents spe...	Starved of food and companionship, Omer Shem Tov used his faith and mental toughness to survive Hamas captivity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Starved of food and companionship, Omer Shem Tov used his faith and mental toughness to survive Hamas captivity, his parents told Channel 13 in an interview Monday. Omer was kidnapped from the Nova dance festival during Hamas' October 7 2023 invasion along with two friends, Maya and Itay Regev, and they stayed together until the brother and sister were released in the first hostage deal, which occurred in late November that year. He didn’t see another hostage for the next 13 months, and for a whopping 50 days he was even in complete isolation, Shelly and Malki said. The terrorists put him in a very deep tunnel that was pitch dark and so low he couldn’t stand up, and so narrow he couldn’t stretch his arms out, they said. 'They gave him a flashlight and a just a tiny bit of food, and sea water, and left him there,' Malki described. He had to ration himself, eating at first two pitot a day, then one, then a half, then just a cookie a day, because he didn't know how long he'd be there. 'Mom, I was so thin I could feel my bones,' Shelly recounted him telling her. Then the battery in the flashlight died and for five days he was 'in total, utter darkness,' Malki said. 'On the fifth day he spoke to God,' Shelly said, 'praying, ‘Please, God, get me out of here, it doesn’t matter to where,’ and he said that two hours later his captor came.' The Hamas terrorists took him to a wider tunnel, one tiled with white tiles, which seemed like real light to him. 'Even in hell there seem to be degrees of hell,' his father remarked with a small chuckle. The Shem Tovs spoke more about Omer’s faith and how it helped him. Once, when he saw a terrorist using his prayer beads, they said, 'Omer told him, ‘Come, I’ll teach you something else: ‘God was, is, and will always be king,’' a common line in Jewish prayer, said especially on the holidays. His captors also once gave him a book on the weekly Torah readings that a Jewish soldier had left behind, 'which he’d like to return' now, the Shem Tovs said with a smile, as the man’s name was written on it. 'He also received Psalm 100,' Shelly said, 'which I would read all the time here&#8230; and he read this psalm in captivity every day.' 'It’s unbelievable,' she said, marveling at the coincidence. Omer also told his parents that he never showed fear to his captors, knowing that if he did, 'they would take advantage of it.' This included when IDF tanks rumbled right over his tunnel, shaking the ground, and he could even hear soldiers speaking in Hebrew – and his captors told him, his parents said, that if they got too close or attempted a rescue, 'they would shoot him in the head.' Shelly, who said that she sat by Omer’s bedside the whole first night he returned, not sleeping, just holding his hand and watching him breathe, said that the word 'joy' has a different meaning for her now. Instead of 'waking up in fear every morning&#8230; it’s opening your eyes and saying, ‘Wow. Wow,’' she recounted with a huge smile and sparkling eyes. Seeing him for the first time in 505 days and hugging him fiercely 'was really like giving birth to my child again,' she said.

IDF soldier’s family reveals first photo in Hamas captivity	Soldier severely wounded and kidnapped on October 7th is still alive, according to recently released hostages. By World Israel News Staff The family of an IDF soldier abducted by Hamas published a photograph of him in captivity, along with a heartfelt plea for the continuation of the ceasefire and hostage deal. Matan Angrest, 21, was dragged unconscious from a tank by Hamas terrorists, during the attack on the Nahal Oz base on October 7th, 2023. Angrest sustained major injuries during the battle, and according to released hostages, he is severely wounded and has not received proper medical care. In the images published by Angrest's family, he is seen with a battered, bruised face and bloodied eye. According to the family, the images were taken at least six months after the terror onslaught. The photographs are screenshots from a Hamas propaganda video featuring Angrest, which the family has chosen not to release in full. The family added that released hostages have said he is suffering mistreatment and abuse due to his status as an IDF soldier. Despite his health condition, he was excluded from the first phase of the hostage release deal because he serving in the military when he was kidnapped. No male Israeli soldiers abducted on October 7th were released in the first phase of the truce. Angrest’s family also said he was 'undergoing hellish torments, torturous interrogations and is being held in inhumane conditions.' 'We heard from released hostages that our beloved son Matan is alive. It was incredibly emotional for us,' Angrest's father Hagai said during an appearance at Hostage's Square in mid-February. 'The time has come to bring him back, along with all the others,' he continued, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'advance the second phase of the deal immediately. We all saw the horrific images, scenes of a Holocaust in 2025, here in Israel. Bring Matan and the rest of the hostages home now. Their situation is dire, and it is time to bring them back.'

Hamas replaced by international coalition in Egypt’s plan for Gaz...	Egyptian 'day after' plan for Gaza missing critical details, such as how Hamas will be ousted from power. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror group will no longer govern the Gaza Strip, which will instead by run by an international coalition of Arab, Muslim, and Western countries, according to an Egyptian plan for the coastal enclave set to be unveiled on Tuesday. Egypt, which has staunchly refused President Donald Trump's request for the country to accept Gazan refugees, said it has drafted an alternative plan for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Strip. According to a Reuters report, the plan is missing numerous critical details that are necessary for its implementation. The plan does not specify how Hamas will be persuaded to step down, nor does it specify how the Strip will be governed without the terror group in control. 'There will be no major international funding for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza if Hamas remains the dominant and armed political element on the ground controlling local governance,' an introduction to the plan reads. The document also does not state who should pay for the reconstruction efforts in Gaza. The Arab League is expected to hold a special summit focused on the future of Gaza, with the meeting to be held in Egypt later on Tuesday. The summit was called after Trump said that the U.S. would encourage the emigration of Gazans from the territory, which would then come under American control during the rebuilding process. In a statement to Reuters, a senior Hamas official said that the terror group was not in contact with Egypt regarding the proposal. 'The day after in Gaza must only be decided by the Palestinians,' Sami Abu Zurhi said. 'Hamas rejects any attempt to impose projects or any form of non-Palestinian administration, or the presence of any foreign forces on the land of the Gaza Strip.' An anonymous Palestinian Authority official told Reuters that 'we agreed with the Egyptians on a committee made of Palestinian experts that will help the Palestinian Authority in running the Gaza Strip for six months. The committee is made of Palestinian experts and coordinates with the PA, and doesn't answer to non-Palestinian bodies.'

MK: ‘Haifa attacker was insane, no such thing as Druze terrorism’	Druze citizens of Israel are known for their loyalty to the state, with nearly all of the community's men serving in the military. By World Israel News Staff The Druze community is insisting that the perpetrator of a deadly stabbing attack, who hails from a Druze background, was mentally ill and not motivated by terror. Yitro Shahin, 20, fatally stabbed an elderly man and wounded four other people at Haifa's HaMifratz bus depot on Monday afternoon, with witnesses reporting that he screamed 'Allahu Akbar' before attacking. Shahin, who was born and raised in Germany but has family roots in the northern city of Shfar'am, was shot dead by security guards at the bus station. The Shahin family told Hebrew-language media outlets that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, has numerous family members who serve in the IDF, including an uncle who is a disabled veteran, and that he was not motivated by Islamic ideology. Druze citizens of Israel are known for their loyalty to the state, with nearly all of the community's men serving in the military. They have faced historic and ongoing persecution from Muslims throughout the Middle East. 'The attacker was recognized by the National Insurance Institute as a mentally ill person and received a disability stipend. He was hospitalized several times in a mental health facility,' MK Hamed Amar, a Druze member of the Yisrael Beitenu party, told Ynet. 'There is no Druze terrorist, there has never been a Druze terrorist, and there will never be a Druze terrorist,' he continued. 'Such an act of terrorism is contrary to every moral and human value and certainly does not reflect the loyal spirit of the Druze community in Israel, which is a full partner in defending the state and its values,' Amar said in a separate media statement. The victim of Shahin's attack was identified as Hassan Dahamshah, an Arab-Israeli from Kfar Kanna. Dahamshah's family told Ynet that Shahin's relatives had contacted them to ask for forgiveness. Dr. Ahmad Karim, the victim's nephew, said that the attacker should have been supervised more closely due to his mental issues. 'As a doctor, I can say that any person with [this level of] psychiatric illness should be in an appropriate setting, and not roaming around like this on a bus or train.' Karim added that the family was still in shock from the incident, and that 'it's not easy to accept [the killing of their relative] and move on.' However, Karim said, 'we accept [the Shahin family's] apology.'

Investigation reveals IDF failed to protect Kfar Aza residents	The military didn’t arrive at the kibbutz until nearly two hours after the invasion, during which time the local security squad displayed remarkable heroism in its defense against the terrorists. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An investigation into Hamas's invasion of Kfar Aza on October 7th revealed that the IDF failed to protect the kibbutz's residents, while the local security squad, which suffered heavy losses, fought valiantly. On October 7, 2023, at around 6:30 a.m., 250 terrorists from the Gaza City Brigade, armed with explosives and weapons, invaded Kfar Aza. They began killing residents, looting property, and taking hostages. Although 100 terrorists were neutralized inside the kibbutz and 50 just outside, Hamas still caused significant damage to the kibbutz, which will require extensive reconstruction. The military did not arrive at the kibbutz until nearly two hours after the invasion, during which time the local security squad displayed remarkable heroism in its defense against the attackers. The security squad, which also fought terrorists outside the kibbutz, suffered heavy losses. Among the Kfar Aza residents, 62 were murdered and 19 were kidnapped. Two of the hostages were accidentally killed by friendly fire, and two remain in Gaza. The investigation found that the military was unprepared for the attack and had no plans for dealing with a Hamas invasion. Not only did the military arrive late to the kibbutz, but they were also poorly equipped and lacked coordinated intelligence and a plan, leading to chaos. Additionally, the evacuation of residents was poorly organized and not executed safely. Although several airstrikes were conducted against Hamas terrorists, they had little to no effect. The investigation was carried out by the 55th Reserve Paratroopers Brigade, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Oded Ziman, and included interviews with kibbutz residents and members of the security squad. An internal IDF probe described Hamas's capture of the Nahal Oz base as 'the biggest failure' of October 7th. The investigation, shared with local media on Monday night, revealed that Nahal Oz, located just half a mile from the Gaza border, was meant to be a forward base but was instead treated as a rear outpost due to financial constraints. It was overrun in less than two hours.

Russia invites Israel to May 9 event; US, EU unwelcome	This year is a round anniversary since the German surrender to the Red Army 80 years ago. By Canaan Lidor, JNS Russia has invited Israel to attend its Victory Day commemorations in May alongside representatives of China, Brazil, Slovakia and Serbia—but not Germany, the United States or most European Union’s member states, Russian media reported Sunday. The annual May 9 commemorations on Red Square in Moscow feature a military parade and speeches by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in recognition of the sacrifices made by his country in its war against Germany in World War II. This year is a round anniversary since the German surrender to the Red Army 80 years ago. A national holiday, May 9 is a major patriotic holiday in Russia and throughout much of the post-Soviet world. The holiday’s main event is the Red Square parade. In contrast to past anniversaries this year, Russia did not invite the United States, most of the European Union, Canada, Australia and other countries it deems 'unfriendly,' according to News.ru. Western leaders have attended the event in the past, including in 2005 when Putin hosted U.S. President George W. Bush and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac. Israel’s then president Moshe Katsav represented it at that event. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last attended the parade in 2018 as one of the only Western leaders present. Israel’s Knesset designated May 9 the previous year as an official holiday. Israel is one of the only countries outside the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States where May 9 is on the official calendar. The day’s addition to the calendar was widely seen as a gesture to Russia but also as recognizing the thousands of Jewish Red Army war veterans living in Israel. Former U.S. president Barack Obama did not attend the 2015 parade, nor did his French counterpart François Hollande. Both leaders stayed away following Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine the previous year. Those countries, as well as Germany and Israel, were nonetheless represented at the 2015 event by their diplomatic corps. Compiled in 2021, the list of 'unfriendly nations' includes the United States, most E.U. member states, Canada and Australia. Russian media noted that this means that Germany would for the first time be absent from the anniversary event. Alexander Tolmachev, a lawmaker in Russia’s Duma, told News.ru on Sunday that Germany cannot be a welcome guest on Red Square 'when its tanks are burning again from Russian shells.' Tolmachev used the initials of the defunct Federal Republic of Germany, also known as West Germany, to refer to present-day Germany. He was referencing military aid given by Germany to Ukraine, including tanks. The United States has supplied weapons to Ukraine and imposed, along with other Western countries, biting sanctions on Russia. Like its Western allies, Israel has also condemned Russia’s invasion, but has not been vocal on the issue as some. When it invaded Ukraine, Russia had military bases in Syria, where it had helped prop up the regime of Bashar Assad until it collapsed in December. Israel has conducted military operations in Syria, mainly against Hezbollah and other terrorist groups, and has sought to avoid confrontations with Russia in Syria and beyond. Israel and Russia reportedly had worked out a procedure for coordinating Israeli military activity in Syria, until this mechanism was suspended following the military escalation that began on Oct. 7, 2023. Last month, Israel voted at the United Nations along with the United States, Russia and Hungary, as well as about a dozen countries in the developing world, against a nonbinding General Assembly resolution condemning Russia as the aggressor in the ongoing war in Ukraine. Almost all other European Union countries voted in favor. U.S. President Donald Trump has outlined a shift in Washington’s policy on Ukraine, from unconditional aid in the war with Russia to an off-ramp toward a negotiated end to the conflict. A spokesperson for Israel’s foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a JNS query regarding who will represent Israel at this year’s event. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, was also invited and plans to attend, according to News.ru.

Internal IDF probe: Battle for Nahal Oz base ‘biggest failure’ of...	The probe also highlighted the heroism of the soldiers who risked their lives to fend off the attack. By JNS Staff A probe by the Israel Defense Forces into the capture of its Nahal Oz military base by Hamas and Palestinian terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, which was made public on Monday, described the ability to defend the border outpost as 'the biggest failure' that day. At the same time, it highlighted the heroism of the soldiers who risked their lives to fend off the attack. The investigation, which was shared with local media on Monday night, revealed that Nahal Oz, just half a mile from the Gaza border, was supposed to be a forward base but was treated as a rear outpost amid financial constraints. It was overrun in just under two hours. As the terrorists launched their assault at 6:29 a.m. on Oct. 7, 162 soldiers were stationed at Nahal Oz—only 90 of them armed. Of the 90, 81 were trained as combat soldiers. The probe noted that Nahal Oz’s perimeter was secured by a single guard, plus three other guards stationed inside the outpost to prevent the theft of weapons, adding that the battle for control was decided within minutes. Some 215 terrorists from Hamas’s Shejaiya Battalion led the assault, according to the probe. They managed to kill 53 soldiers, in addition to kidnapping three troops and seven female IDF observers. The IDF fighters deployed to Nahal Oz, working in cooperation with the Israeli Air Force, managed to eliminate 71 terrorists during the firefight. By analyzing hundreds of social-media posts from IDF soldiers at Nahal Oz, Hamas managed to create an accurate map of the base and knew where soldiers slept, as well as the location of shelters, communication equipment, surveillance cameras and the war room. 'The best time to attack the outpost is first light. The recommended day of attack—the weekend and on Jewish holidays when some soldiers are at home on leave,' a seized Hamas file read. 'The recommendation: high-trajectory [rocket] fire that will bring the soldiers into shelters.' The probe highlighted the bravery of Golani company commander Maj. Shilo Har-Even, 25, who despite being seriously wounded led counter-attacks against terrorists at Nahal Oz until he was killed in battle. Hamas also faced fierce resistance from IDF Warrant Officer Ibrahim Kharuba, 39, a Bedouin soldier who fought to protect the defenseless female observers. During the battle, Kharuba was said to have told the lookouts that it would be an honor to die protecting them and the Jewish state. A devout Muslim, he was killed in a shootout. Following the probe, Har-Even and Kharuba were both recommended for the Medal of Valor, the Jewish nation’s highest military decoration. The probe, which concludes that the army failed to prepare for a large-scale ground invasion, in particular under rocket fire, was presented to Defense Minister Israel Katz by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. On Thursday, the IDF presented the findings of its wide-ranging internal probes into the failures leading up to and during the Hamas-led attacks, and the resulting massacre of 1,200 people in Israel’s south on Oct. 7. 'The State of Israel chose a policy of ‘conflict management’ vis-à-vis Hamas, whose purpose is to preserve and improve the existing reality, and from which the military methods of operation were derived,' the IDF charged in the probes, which were geared to draw operational lessons and not take aim at decisions by the political echelons. In total, 5,500 terrorists infiltrated Israel through 114 breaches in the border, and also used seven vessels and six paragliders, according to the IDF’s findings. The Hamas-led terrorists were said to have breached the security barrier under the cover of at least 3,889 rockets and 57 drones. The military now understands that the terror organization had gradually prepared plans to 'break the defense of the Gaza Division' since 2016. Yet when the Military Intelligence Directorate obtained Hamas’s plans, dubbed 'Jericho Wall,' in 2022, they were dismissed as unrealistic. 'The responsibility is mine. I was the commander of the army on Oct. 7, and I also bear the full responsibility for all of you,' stated Halevi, who has taken the blame for the military’s failures and plans to resign in March, in remarks published by the IDF on Thursday evening.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During a Knesset plenum debate, MK Chili Tropper read aloud from a letter that freed hostage Yarden Bibas had addressed to Netanyahu. Bibas, along with his wife Shiri and their two children, Ariel (4) and Kfir (9 months), were kidnapped by Hamas from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th. Yarden Bibas, the sole survivor of the family, was released before the bodies of his wife and children were returned to Israel. The letter began, 'Mr. Prime Minister, my name is Yarden Bibas. As you listen to this speech, I am sitting shiva for my wife, Shiri, and my children, Kfir and Ariel—innocent, pure souls who were kidnapped from our home and murdered while in captivity. They could and should have been saved.' Bibas pointed out that on the morning of October 7th, 'The state was not in Nir Oz,' and instead, the kibbutz had to rely on local heroes to defend the community against the Hamas onslaught. 'Today, 514 days later, I return from Gaza to face an unimaginable reality: I had to bury my entire family in a single day. I wouldn’t wish this horrific nightmare on anyone. Despite the overwhelming pain, I ask you, in this moment, to hold back. The time for revenge has not yet arrived.' 'At this stage,' Bibas wrote, 'We are obligated to immediately bring back our brothers.' Bibas also mentioned his friends David Cunio and his brother Ariel, whom he befriended at a young age, and who are now being held captive by Hamas. Bibas declared that the hostages should be freed before any strategy to eliminate Hamas is implemented. 'Once we bring David and all the hostages home, I will be the first to support any action to dismantle Hamas. As a resident of Nir Oz, I understand that we must defeat Hamas because, without doing so, we will never have security. But we must always honor the sanctity of life, respect the dignity of the dead, and ensure no one is left behind—because without these principles, we lose our very essence.' The letter also called for a state commission of inquiry into the causes of the October 7th invasion. 'So many civilians are asking for forgiveness, yet so few politicians are doing the same. So many civilians and soldiers are taking responsibility, while so few government officials are,' Bibas wrote.

Katz: 'We will resume fighting, and they will face the IDF with force and methods they have never encountered before—until we achieve complete victory.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a stark warning to Hamas, stating that they would face 'the gates of hell' if they refuse to release the remaining hostages. At an event commemorating the 33rd anniversary of Menachem Begin's passing, Katz said, 'In recent days, with a heavy heart, we have recovered the remains of eight additional captives who were murdered by Hamas in Gaza.' Katz reaffirmed the government's commitment to bringing home all remaining hostages, both living and deceased. 'The ceasefire agreement with Hamas and the heavy toll Israel has endured — and is willing to continue paying — was aimed at securing the swift release of all living Israeli hostages and returning the remains of those who have passed. This is our moral obligation and ultimate objective. In these critical days, we are working tirelessly to achieve this goal.' However, with Hamas rejecting the hostage release proposal put forward by U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, the terror group has created an impasse in negotiations. Despite this, Katz indicated there would be a few more days of negotiations in an attempt to revive the deal, but he emphasized that Israel would send no humanitarian aid into Gaza, fearing it would be stolen by Hamas. 'Despite ongoing violations by Hamas and its rejection of the proposal from President Trump's Special Envoy for the Middle East, Steven Witkoff, we have agreed to the mediators' request for additional negotiation time. In the meantime, we have halted all humanitarian aid to Gaza,' he stated. Katz warned, 'Make no mistake, Hamas — this is just the beginning. If Hamas does not release the hostages soon, the gates of Gaza will close, and the gates of hell will open.' 'We will resume fighting, and they will face the IDF with force and tactics unlike anything they have encountered before — until we achieve complete victory. We will never allow Hamas to rule Gaza. This conflict will end with two clear outcomes: the release of all our hostages and the total defeat of Hamas' rule in Gaza,' he declared.

Iranian VP resigns as regime rejects US talks	The Leader Khamenei said that we will not talk to the United States, and I announce that we will not talk to the United States. It is over,' Pezeshkian declared. By Jewish Breaking News The Iranian rial has collapsed to historic lows, hovering above 920,000 against the US dollar. Oil tankers drift aimlessly at sea, unable to deliver their cargo. Frozen assets remain locked away in foreign banks. This is the reality of Iran under what Donald Trump dubbed his 'maximum pressure' campaign – a strategy now continuing into Trump’s second term that has pushed the Islamic Republic’s economy to the brink. 'We are in a full-scale war with the enemy, and they are imposing economic pressure on us. The situation today is worse than the eight-year war with Iraq,' President Masoud Pezeshkian told parliament on Sunday. 'With Trump’s signature, the country’s oil tankers and gas ships are left adrift, wondering how to get the energy to its destination.' The Iranian president also pointed to financial challenges caused by the non-repayment of debts by several countries. '$6bn,' he noted bluntly. 'Qatar will not return $6bn, and Iraq and Turkey are not paying back their debts either.' Frozen in South Korean banks due to US sanctions and later transferred to accounts in Doha as part of a 2023 prisoner swap deal, the funds remain inaccessible following what state-run ISNA reports describe as a 'quiet understanding' between Washington and Qatar. Still, Iran is refusing to bend to American demands for negotiations. 'The Leader Khamenei said that we will not talk to the United States, and I announce that we will not talk to the United States. It is over,' Pezeshkian declared. 'I believe in dialogue and will remain so, but what the Leader has determined regarding negotiations with the United States, we will stand on this position until the end and will not act on anything else.' Meanwhile, Iranian Vice President Mohammad Javad Zarif has announced his resignation. Though ISNA insists his resignation bears no relation to leaderships refusal to engage with Washington, political observers note that Zarif, who previously crafted the 2015 nuclear agreement, likely joined Pezeshkian’s government with hopes of reviving diplomatic channels.

40% of Israelis fear Trump could abandon Israel	More than half of right-wing Israelis believe such a scenario is unlikely, though approximately one-third consider it a real possibility. By TPS A significant number of Israelis fear that there is a high possibility of US President Donald Trump abandoning Israel if Jerusalem’s policies don’t align with US interests, according to a survey released on Monday. The survey, commissioned by The Israeli Democracy Institute, comes on the heels of a heated exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday. The Jerusalem-based research center Israel Democracy Institute asked Israelis what the likelihood is that President Trump would turn his back on Israel if he perceives its policies aren’t in line with Washington. Approximately half of the Israeli public believes such a scenario is either quite unlikely or very unlikely, the survey found. However, a significant portion — around 40% — worries that the possibility of Trump and Israel having a falling out is either quite high or very high. 'President Trump is unpredictable,' Prof. Eyal Zisser, Chair of The Department for Middle Eastern and African History of the Tel Aviv University, told The Press Service of Israel. 'Israel is slightly different from Ukraine, because we have the support of the Republican Party and because Israel is the strategic ally of the US. But if Israel irritates Trump, he can as well turn his back to us as he did to Ukraine.' The survey revealed notable differences across demographic groups. Among Jewish Israelis, 41% believe there is a high chance of an American pivot away from Israel, compared to 30% among Arab Israelis. Political affiliation shows even starker contrasts. More than half of left-wing Israelis believe there’s a high or very high chance Trump would withdraw support, while only about one-third think this is unlikely. Conversely, more than half of right-wing Israelis believe such a scenario is unlikely, though approximately one-third consider it a real possibility. Centrists remain divided on the issue. The February 2025 Israeli Voice Index, conducted by the Viterbi Center at the Israel Democracy Institute, surveyed 759 Israeli adults online and by phone from February 25-28, before Zelensky’s Oval Office meeting. The results had a margin of error of 3.5%. Zelensky was expected to sign a minerals agreement with the US. Instead, in front of live cameras, Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance argued with Zelensky over Russia’s commitment to resolving the war through diplomacy.

Argentine President Milei to visit Israel this month	The South American leader has broken with decades of Argentinian foreign policy tradition by firmly siding with Israel since taking office over a year ago, propelling relations between the two nations to unprecedented heights. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS Argentinian President Javier Milei is scheduled to visit Israel later this month in his second visit to the country in as many years. The March 23 visit, which is to include a landmark address to the Knesset, comes as the Argentinian leader has emerged as one of Israel’s most vocal supporters, firmly aligning himself with both Jerusalem and Washington. Milei is also expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to Israeli officials. The planned trip follows an invitation to formally address the Israeli parliament extended to Milei last month by Knesset Speaker Amir Ohama. The South American leader has broken with decades of Argentinian foreign policy tradition by firmly siding with Israel since taking office over a year ago, propelling relations between the two nations to unprecedented heights. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were first established 75 years ago. Last year, in one of his first official trips as president, Milei paid a wartime solidarity visit to Israel, where he reiterated his pledge to move his country’s embassy to Jerusalem. An iconoclast and political outsider, Milei was elected in November 2023 amid a burgeoning economic crisis and skyrocketing inflation that has long beleaguered the large South American country, which is making major strides toward recovery under his leadership. A week after his election victory, he visited the United States for government meetings, stopping at the grave in New York of the late Lubavitcher Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. It was his third such visit that year. Since taking office, he has listed Hamas as a terrorist organization and called out Iran’s terrorism, vowing to try in absentia Iranian suspects in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires. Last month, Milei declared two days of national mourning for the Bibas children, Ariel, 4, and nine-month-old baby Kfir, who were murdered in captivity by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, along with their mother Shiri. The family, which held Israeli, Argentine and German citizenship, had become symbols of the plight of the 250 hostages abducted by Hamas during the terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre.

By Joshua Marks, JNS Itzik Elgarat, who was murdered while in Hamas captivity in Gaza and whose body was returned to Israel last week, was laid to rest at Kibbutz Nir Oz on Monday. As the funeral procession set out from Rishon LeZion toward Nir Oz, Itzik’s brother Dani recited the Kaddish. Along the route to the kibbutz, thousands stood with Israeli flags to pay their respects. The funeral in Nir Oz was also attended by thousands. Eulogies were delivered by his brother Dani, his sister Rachel Danzig—who survived the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre—his nephews Amit, Tor and Mor, his niece Reut Goldstein, and The Democrats chairman Yair Golan.

UN’s nuclear watchdog warns Iran has enough enriched uranium for ...	Iran's nuclear program has dramatically expanded the country's stockpile of 60% enriched uranium, International Atomic Energy Agency warns, with enough fissile material to produce six nuclear warheads. By World Israel News Staff The United Nations' nuclear watchdog body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has reported a significant increase in Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, raising concerns about the country's potential to develop nuclear weapons. According to IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi, Iran’s 60% enriched uranium reserves have reached 275 kilograms—an increase of approximately one nuclear weapon’s worth per month since last December. The latest report, presented to the IAEA Board of Governors on Monday, underscores the acceleration of Tehran’s nuclear program since President Donald Trump's election victory. The agency has determined that Iran now possesses enough 60% enriched uranium that, if further refined to 90% weapons-grade level, could produce at least six nuclear weapons. This calculation does not include the country’s additional stockpiles of 20% and lower-enriched uranium, which could further expand its nuclear capabilities. Israeli and some U.S. intelligence estimates suggest that Iran could potentially develop an even larger number of nuclear weapons than the IAEA projects, particularly if Tehran opts for smaller warhead designs. These concerns have been amplified by Iran’s acceleration of uranium enrichment, which reportedly spiked in response to the IAEA Board’s condemnation of its nuclear violations in November 2024. The alarming revelations come amid political upheaval in Tehran, as Iranian leadership on Sunday forced out Vice President Javad Zarif, one of the government’s key figures advocating for diplomacy with the West. Zarif's departure raises further questions about Iran’s willingness to engage in nuclear negotiations or de-escalate tensions with the international community. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has expanded sanctions against Iran, as part of its policy of 'maximum pressure,' to force Tehran to either abandon its atomic aspirations or to return to the negotiating table to reach a deal to replace the 2015 nuclear agreement.

Russia accuses Zelensky of being ‘traitor to Jews,’ and a ‘pure N...	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterates claim that Ukraine's Jewish president is a 'pure Nazi,' calling him a 'traitor to the Jewish people' while defending Russia's invasion. By World Israel News Staff Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Ukraine's Jewish president of being a 'pure Nazi' who betrayed 'the Jewish people,' referencing the Putin government's past accusations of Nazism by Kyiv. Speaking with the Russian defense ministry's official media outlet Krasnaya Zvezda, Lavrov said over the weekend that Volodymyr Zelensky is 'nazifying' Ukraine, justifying Russia's February 2022 invasion of its neighbor and the continuing war between the two countries. 'Zelensky has turned 180 degrees from a man who came to power on slogans of peace, on slogans of ‘leave the Russian language alone, it is our common language, our common culture,'' Lavrov said. 'And in six months he has turned into a pure Nazi and, as Russian President Putin correctly said, into a traitor to the Jewish people.' The comments came after President Donald Trump ordered Zelensky out of the White House following a stormy televised meeting between the two leaders, as Trump attempted to win Zelensky's support for a deal trading American aid for mineral development rights in Ukraine. The Trump administration has pushed Zelensky's government to accept a ceasefire with Russia that does not mandate a full withdrawal to the pre-war borders. As part of the deal, Trump has offered to provide additional U.S. aid to Ukraine, with Kyiv granting the U.S. rights to extract mineral deposits in the Eastern European country - a move supporters say would tacitly ensure American support of Ukraine's current borders. Zelensky has rejected the plan, demanding America press Russia for a full withdrawal. Kyiv also criticized the mineral development proposal, saying its terms are overly favorable for the U.S. During his interview over the weekend, Lavrov warned that Russia would not accept a prolonged European military presence in Ukraine, including under a peacekeeping mandate. 'Just as [the Ukrainian government] was brought to power on bayonets and pushed forward, they now want to prop them up with their bayonets in the form of peacekeeping units. But this will mean that the root causes [of the war] will not disappear.' 'When we ask these thinkers what will hypothetically happen to the part they take under control, they respond that nothing will change – it will remain Ukraine. I asked one person: will the Russian language be banned there? He said nothing. They cannot utter words of condemnation for what has happened.'

Netanyahu apologizes to freed hostage: ‘I regret it took so long’	Israeli Prime Minister consoles freed hostage who lost his wife, daughters, and brother to Hamas terrorism, laments his lengthy captivity in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with former Gaza hostage Eli Sharabi Sunday evening, offering his condolences to the bereaved father and husband, while also lamenting his 16 months in captivity. 'I welcome your return home. I know that you are enduring difficult days. My wife and I would like to console you on your terrible loss – of Lianne, Noiya and Yahel, and your brother Yossi,' Netanyahu said. Sharabi's wife, Lianne, and the couple's two daughters were murdered by Hamas terrorists during the invasion of October 7th, 2023. While Eli and his brother Yossi were both taken hostage, Yossi died in captivity in the Gaza Strip. 'I understand the magnitude of the loss; this is awful,' Netanyahu continued, apologizing for the time it took to bring Sharabi back to Israel. 'I want you to know that I regret that it took us such a long time. We fought hard to get you out; your brother and the entire family fought hard. Sharon was in close contact with me the entire time,' Netanyahu said of Sharabi's other brother. 'I tried to speak with you about 10 days ago and I am pleased that it is happening now. I greatly appreciate the bravery with which you have told about what you endured, and it is very important that you also tell this to President Trump,' Netanyahu continued, referencing President Donald Trump's invitation to the 53-year-old former hostage. On Sunday, Sharon Sharabi revealed that Eli and a number of other freed hostages are slated to travel to Washington D.C. on Tuesday to meet with Trump. 'I wish you a successful trip, and when you return, I would be pleased for us to meet, when it is possible. We embrace you will all our hearts,' Netanyahu added. Sharabi thanked Netanyahu for the call, while emphasizing the need to bring the remaining hostages home as soon as possible. 'I thank you for your efforts in this direction. Sharon and I will make our efforts with President Trump, and maybe with our joint efforts we will bring this saga to a close.'

By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Two Democrats are presenting this week a bill to the New York State assembly that would outlaw the display of terrorist flags, slapping wrongdoers with a punishment of up to four years in prison, The New York Post reported Sunday. Called the Stand Against Flags of Enemy Terrorists Act, it was authored by State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblyman Micah Lasher. It would amend the classification of what is considered aggravated harassment in the first degree to include instances when a person displays a symbol of a foreign terrorist organization with the intent to harass, annoy, threaten or another person. There are some symbols that 'cross the line' from free speech to fomenting hate, Lasher told the daily, 'and the emblems of mass-murdering terrorist organizations certainly belong in that category.' Flags of Hezbollah, Hamas, and other Middle East terror groups would join the Nazi swastika, and KKK symbols of flaming crosses and nooses as emblems that cannot be brandished about in public. Anti-Israel activists have often flown Hamas flags at the myriad protests they have held throughout New York City since the Gazan terror organization led an assault on Israel on October 7, 2023 in which they massacred 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, sparking the war that lasted 15 months before a tenuous ceasefire began in January. Protesters have also worn Hezbollah headbands and displayed pictures of terror leaders assassinated by Israel such as Hamas political head Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah as they marched and chanted slogans calling for Israel’s destruction, such as 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.' Hoylman-Sigal, who represents a large portion of the West Side of Manhattan, home to thousands of Jews, condemned the incidents as antisemitic. 'Since the October 7th terror attack in Israel, we’ve witnessed a disturbing rise in antisemitic instances here at home, including using symbols and flags of terrorist organizations to harass and intimidate Jewish New Yorkers at their synagogues, businesses and homes, simply because they’re Jewish,' he said in a statement, adding that 'no one should be allowed' to do so. Eric Goldstein, CEO of the UJA-Federation of New York, applauded the move. 'No one should have to face intimidation or the feeling that they are unsafe because of their Jewish identity,' he said. 'The S.A.F.E.T.Y. Act is a necessary and sensible measure to prevent the use of terrorist symbols as a tool of hate and intimidation.' Last summer, a poll by the New York Solidarity Network found that 44% of Jewish respondents said they personally felt unsafe as Jews in New York City, and 67% of Orthodox and identifiably Jewish respondents said they felt unsafe. This accorded with local police statistics, which showed that in the first half of 2024, a whopping 200 of 329 hate crimes targeted Jews.

Israel pushes to keep Russian bases in Syria as Turkish threat gr...	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has previously called for an alliance of Islamic countries in Syria against what he described as Israel’s 'expansionist policies.' By Jewish Breaking News Turkey’s ever-growing influence in post-Assad Syria has Israel nervous, with Israeli officials now lobbying Washington to maintain Russian military bases as a counterweight. At the heart of Israel’s anxiety is the rise of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group now leading Syria’s new government. HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has attempted to present himself as a moderate, promising inclusive governance and even promising to leave Israel one. 'We don’t want conflict either with Israel or with other countries. Syria won’t be used to target other countries. Syrians are tired and just need to live in peace,' al-Sharaa told foreign journalists in December. 'Our first concern is to get people to return home, whether from abroad or displaced people in Syria. We need to secure this transitional period, while providing the necessary assistance for the return of displaced persons, refugees and Syrians in general.' But Israel remains unconvinced, viewing HTS assurances with deep skepticism. Furthermore, Israeli officials believe that Turkey is supporting Iran’s efforts to rebuild Hezbollah and fear that it wishes to open an entirely new hostile front. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has previously called for an alliance of Islamic countries in Syria against what he described as Israel’s 'expansionist policies.' According to Reuters, Israeli intelligence presented American officials with a 'white paper' in February documenting Turkey’s covert activities in Syria. At this meeting, Israel advocated for maintaining Russia’s strategic military presence in Tartus and airbase in Latakia, arguing this would provide Moscow with substantial regional influence. Whether the current US administration will be receptive to Israel’s position remains to be seen. Some analysts believe President Trump, with his unique relationship with dictator Vladimir Putin, might be more open to allowing Russian bases to remain in Syria as part of a broader regional strategy.

Netanyahu’s office: Intelligence officer didn’t pass on alert to ...	An internal military probe into the hours leading up to the massacre published on Thursday revealed that the first signs of an impending invasion were detected around 9 p.m., some nine-and-a-half hours before Hamas and Palestinian Arabs breached the border fence. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office acknowledged over the weekend that the intelligence officers of six key leaders, including the premier, were alerted some three hours before the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. The intelligence officers received the Israel Defense Forces’ alert along with a note that Hamas was operating as usual and that the military’s Southern Command would discuss the issue in the morning, said the Prime Minister’s Office, adding that Netanyahu’s officer forwarded the message to the PMO military secretary, Maj. Gen. Avi Gil, but decided not to wake up the premier as the missive did not convey urgency. Netanyahu 'has full confidence in the military secretariat of his office,' his office emphasized in the statement, which came in response to a Channel 12 News report that seemed to shift blame onto the intelligence officer. Saturday’s Channel 12 report cited outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi as saying that the military did not publicize the claim that the PMO had been alerted to Hamas’s suspicious activities ahead of time 'even though this could have helped us in the face of the bad things that are being said about us. 'If the prime minister’s intelligence officer was a person of integrity, he should already have told him [Netanyahu] that he knew about [Hamas’s preparations on the eve of the attack] and did not update [Netanyahu]. He [the officer] did not do this,' Halevi added, according to the report. An internal military probe into the hours leading up to the massacre published on Thursday revealed that the first signs of an impending invasion were detected around 9 p.m., some nine-and-a-half hours before Hamas and Palestinian Arabs breached the border fence. Warning signs included preparations for rocket fire, operatives entering tunnels and the activation of dozens of Israeli SIM cards inside the Strip. The offices of Netanyahu and then-Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant were informed of the developments during the night; however, political officials were not woken up by their military secretaries. After the attack was launched at 6:29 a.m. the next day—the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah—some 5,500 terrorists infiltrated Israeli territory through 114 breaches in the security fence, and using seven vessels and six paragliders, according to the IDF’s findings. The Hamas-led terrorists were said to have breached the border under the cover of 3,889 rockets and 57 drones. The military now understands that Hamas had prepared plans to 'break the defense of the Gaza Division' since 2016. Yet when the Military Intelligence Directorate obtained Hamas’s attack plans, dubbed 'Jericho Wall,' in 2022, they were dismissed as unrealistic. Halevi was not informed of the 'Jericho Wall' plan and only heard about it some two weeks into the war, the IDF investigation claimed.

‘Sad moment for cinema’ – Israel rips Academy Award for documenta...	The movie, about Israeli demolitions in illegal Palestinian villages, 'distort Israel’s image in the world,' he wrote. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Culture and Sport Minister Miki Zohar slammed the Oscar award given Sunday to a joint Israeli-Palestinian documentary that casts Israel in a 'distorted' negative light. 'The Oscar win for the film ‘No Other Country’ is a sad moment for the world of cinema – instead of presenting the complexity of our reality, the filmmakers chose to echo narratives that distort Israel’s image in the world,' Zohar posted to X. 'Freedom of expression is an important value, but turning the slander of Israel into a tool for international promotion is not creativity – it is sabotage of the State of Israel, and after the massacre of October 7 and the ongoing war, it doubly hurts,' he added. In his acceptance speech, the movie’s chief protagonist, Basel Adra, called Israel’s actions 'ethnic cleansing,' and said that he hoped that his newborn daughter 'will not have to live the same life I'm living now, always fearing settlers, violence, home demolitions and forcible displacements. We call on the world to take serious actions to stop the injustice.' His Israeli film-partner, Yuval Abraham, appealed to the American government to stop helping to 'block' what he called 'a different path, a political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people.' He also told the audience that 'the terrible destruction of Gaza must end, the Israeli hostages who were taken in the crimes of October 7th must be released.' Abraham had been condemned in Israel when in acceptance speeches at previous awards ceremonies, he spoke about Gaza being devastated while not even mentioning the fact that Hamas had taken 251 hostages during its October 7, 2023 invasion of Israel, 62 of whom are still in captivity, although more than half are known to be dead. The film describes the efforts of Palestinian and Israeli activists to stop repeated demolitions of homes and evictions from the South Hebron Hills Masafer Yatta group of Palestinian villages that are located in an official IDF firing zone, and thus a closed military site. The villagers have appealed several times to Israel’s highest court since 1999, when the government first issued eviction orders to Masafer Yatta residents. In 2022, the High Court of Justice ruled that there were no legal barriers to expelling the residents in order to enable military training. Since then, the Civil Administration has occasionally sent in bulldozers and men to demolish a few houses or other structures, confiscate vehicles and equipment, and issue 'stop work' orders to block expansion of the villages, which receive no permits to build due to their illegal status. International pressure has successfully prevented any wholesale destruction of the 13 tiny communities. Only two have been taken down so far, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which noted in 2022 there were a total of 215 Palestinian households in the area, with about 1,150 people in all. Unlike many films made in Israel, the documentary received no government support due to its negative portrayal of the country, and officially it is labeled a Palestinian-Norwegian film. The award for Best Documentary Film was reportedly going to be presented by Israeli actress Gal Gadot but ultimately it was presented by Samuel L. Jackson and Selena Gomez.

Israeli scientists identify two types of heart scars, paving the ...	By Pesach Benson, TPS Challenging conventional medical wisdom, Israeli scientists found that scar tissue formation in the heart occurs through two distinct mechanisms — a discovery that could lead to new and more targeted therapeutic approaches for heart disease. The findings of what the Weizmann Institute researchers describe as 'hot fibrosis' and 'cold fibrosis' were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, Cell Systems. The research began as an unexpected collaboration between two scientists at the Weizmann Institute. Prof. Eldad Tzahor, an expert in heart disease, learned about a mathematical model developed by his neighbor, Prof. Uri Alon. That model, initially designed to classify scar tissue in various organs, suggested that fibrosis could be categorized based on interactions between just two cell types: fibroblasts, which produce collagen and provide tissue structure, and macrophages, immune cells involved in tissue repair and inflammation. 'At first, it sounded too simplistic to me,' admitted Tzahor. 'Biological systems are incredibly complex, but the idea intrigued me. It was a great opportunity to collaborate with Uri, so I proposed we test the model on heart disease.' Scar tissue forms in the heart when muscle cells are damaged, often due to heart attacks. While this scar tissue helps maintain the organ’s structural integrity, it does not contract effectively, leading to impaired heart function over time. Since there is currently no effective treatment to eliminate or reverse heart fibrosis, medical efforts focus on prevention and minimizing scar formation. The first mechanism, 'hot fibrosis,' involves active interactions between myofibroblasts and macrophages. Because macrophages are immune system cells often linked to inflammation and fever, this type of fibrosis was named 'hot.' The second mechanism, 'cold fibrosis,' is independent of macrophages; instead, myofibroblasts sustain the fibrosis process autonomously by secreting molecules that perpetuate scar formation. 'In medical textbooks, microscopic images of heart scars appear uniform, leading to the assumption that all fibrosis in the heart follows the same biological pathway,' explained Shoval Miyara, a joint doctoral student of Professors Tzahor and Alon and one of the research leaders. 'Our findings challenge that notion and show that these are, actually, two different diseases requiring different treatments,' she added. Using real human heart tissue samples, the research team confirmed the model’s predictions. The findings are particularly significant given the staggering number of heart cells affected by fibrosis. The left ventricle of the human heart contains roughly four billion muscle cells. During a heart attack around one billion — or 25 percent — die. Understanding how scars form and how they can be treated more precisely may improve long-term survival and quality of life for millions of patients worldwide. 'If we can identify whether a patient has hot or cold fibrosis, we could tailor treatments to target the specific process involved,' said Tzahor. 'This could lead to more effective therapies and better outcomes for people with heart disease.' The practical applications of this discovery could significantly impact cardiology and fibrosis treatment across various medical fields. Understanding whether a patient has 'hot fibrosis' or 'cold fibrosis' could allow doctors to prescribe tailored treatments that specifically address the underlying biological mechanism. For example, drug companies may one day develop anti-inflammatory or immune-modulating therapies for hot fibrosis and drugs that block fibroblast self-sustaining signals for cold fibrosis. The research could open new avenues for diagnostic tools that differentiate between the two fibrosis types. Since fibrosis is a major factor in lung (pulmonary fibrosis), kidney, and liver diseases (cirrhosis), researchers may examine whether these organs also develop hot and cold fibrosis. The study hinted that a similar classification could apply to scars that form after a stroke or in cancerous tissues. 'This collaboration changed my perspective on the biology of the heart,' said Alon. 'Our combination of mathematical models, fundamental biology, and medical research has revealed something new. Now, future studies can explore whether this hot-cold fibrosis distinction applies to scarring in other organs.'

Former Hamas hostage Emily Damari undergoes surgeries for injurie...	Damari lost two fingers when she was shot by Hamas gunmen during the Oct. 7, 2023, kidnapping from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. By JNS Emily Damari, a British-Israeli woman who was taken captive during Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre and held for 471 days in Gaza, underwent a series of surgeries on her hand and leg on Sunday due to complications from the wounds inflicted on her by the Palestinian terrorist organization. In a statement from Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer in Ramat Gan before the operation, Damari said she 'fully embraced' her scars, explaining, 'To me, they represent freedom, hope and strength. 'My recovery will take time and my hand will never fully recover, but the intense pain I had for a year and a half due to the nerves being sewn together after my first operation at Shifa Hospital in Gaza is now no longer with me and the large scar, that was caused by an open, festering wound that did not heal for four months because of the conditions of the tunnels I was held in, is now looking better,' she continued. Damari and two other Israeli hostages were handed over by Hamas to a team of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza on Jan. 19, as part of the ceasefire agreement with the terrorist organization. Following a medical examination and reunion with their mothers at an IDF reception point near the Gaza border and their subsequent transfer to the hospital via helicopter, Sheba General Hospital Director Dr. Yael Frenkel Nir told reporters that the women’s physical condition was good enough to allow them to focus on reuniting with other family members. Damari lost two fingers when she was shot by Hamas gunmen during the Oct. 7, 2023, kidnapping from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Emily’s mother, Mandy, said on Sunday that her daughter had been 'sewn up like a pin cushion' in Gaza, leaving her in considerable pain. Hamas did not provide anything besides an expired bottle of iodine during her captivity, Mandy Damari noted, adding that 'it is nothing short of a miracle that she did not contract a life-threatening infection.' For long stretches of time, the group kept her in its underground tunnels network with no sanitation or access to clean water, Emily Damari said. 'It was shocking but not surprising to see how emaciated some of the other hostages were when they came out. Hamas has created hell on Earth, the conditions down there are unimaginable,' she said. 'I want to thank President [U.S. President Donald] Trump again for securing the deal to get me home. Please help us to bring home Gali, Ziv and all of the remaining hostages as well, before it is too late for all of them,' Damari pleaded, referencing twin brothers Gali and Ziv Berman, her close friends from Kibbutz Kfar Aza who were abducted alongside her during the attack. Israeli assessments indicate that Palestinian terrorist groups in the Strip are holding 59 hostages. Of these, 24 are believed to be alive—all men—while 35, including three women, are believed to be deceased. Two of the living hostages and three of the deceased are foreign nationals.

Elderly man murdered, 4 wounded in Haifa terror attack	Arab terrorist stabs pedestrians at bus stop in northern Israeli city of Haifa, murdering one and wounding four others. By World Israel News Staff At least five people were wounded, including one fatally, in a terrorist stabbing attack in the northern Israeli city of Haifa Monday morning. The attack occurred at a bus stop adjacent to the Lev HaMifratz Mall (Cinemall), near the Haifa Central Bus Station just after 9:50 a.m. Monday when a terrorist began stabbing pedestrians waiting at the bus stop. There are currently unverified reports that a second terrorist was also involved in the attack. Police have dispatched forces to the area and launched a manhunt for additional terrorists. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were called to the scene to treat the wounded and evacuate them to Rambam Medical Center in Haifa. Paramedics were forced to declare one victim, a 70-year-old man, dead at the scene. According to an MDA spokesperson, four other victims were treated at the scene before being evacuated to Rambam Medical Center, including three people in serious condition including a man and a woman in their early 30s and a teenage boy roughly 15 years of age. In addition, a 70-year-old woman is listed in moderate condition. MDA chief spokesman Zaki Heller said that the terrorist responsible for the stabbing was shot and killed during the attack by soldiers and armed civilians. Witnesses say the terrorist took a bus to Haifa, and, upon his arrival, got off the bus and began shouting 'Allahu Akbar' before stabbing his victims. The attack comes just days after a Palestinian Arab terrorist illegally residing in northern Israel rammed into pedestrians waiting at a bus stop at Karkur Junction near Pardes Hanna last Thursday, injuring 14 people, one of them critically.

HaLevi: Many Oct. 7th victims’ last words were ‘Where’s the IDF?’	Herzi HaLevi admitted that the army never believed that Hamas was capable of carrying out a terror onslaught on the scale of October 7th. By World Israel News Staff Outgoing IDF Chief-of-Staff Herzi HaLevi spoke of the Israeli military's profound failures on October 7th, saying that he is aware that the final thoughts of many murdered on that day were questioning the IDF's whereabouts. 'I know lots of people were murdered, and their last words were, ‘Where is the IDF?’ I know that,' HaLevi, who resigned from his role in January, told Channel 12 News in an interview broadcast Sunday evening. HaLevi said that the army did not believe that Hamas was capable of carrying out a terror onslaught on that scale. 'We considered Hamas to be a limited military force. We didn’t see a scenario of a wide surprise attack as a realistic scenario. And if there was to be something like that, our assumption was that we would get a warning ahead of time from [military] intelligence,' he said. He added that when he considered which of Israel's borders posed the biggest security risk, 'I put the Gaza as the last border that needed attention.' HaLevi stressed that the Israeli military was confident in the Gaza border, including a prevailing belief that 'the subterranean barrier was very high quality,' that Israeli had superior intelligence gathering and that the physical topography of the region was advantageous to Israel. 'We thought our situation overall was good,' he said. HaLevi spoke of the IDF's failed defense of many Gaza-adjacent kibbutzim, confirming the claims of many residents that troops never reached some communities at all while the invasion was ongoing. 'The results were terrible. As someone from Nir Oz told me, the first soldier arrived after the last terrorist had left,' HaLevi said. 'That’s the worst thing that we could hear.' HaLevi is being succeeded by Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who is slated to take office on Thursday, March 5. Zamir has already summoned senior military officials to Southern Command for a meeting this Friday, underscoring Israel's threat to return to war against Hamas in Gaza.

Israel considering cutting electricity to Gaza, evacuating Gazans...	Israeli government mulling plans to pressure Hamas to resume hostage releases, including cutting electricity transfers to the Gaza Strip, resuming war on Hamas, and evacuating Gazans from the northern Gaza Strip. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's government is considering a number of measures to pressure Hamas into releasing additional hostages, the Israeli national broadcaster Kan reported Sunday night, after the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas lapsed over the weekend. On Sunday, the first phase of the January 19th ceasefire ended, with no agreement on either a continuation of the existing hostages-for-truce arrangement or implementation of the second phase of the hostage deal. While Israel embraced an American proposal to extend the truce through the Ramadan and Passover holidays, ending on April 19th, in exchange for the release of all remaining hostages in two transfers, Hamas has insisted Israel negotiate the full withdrawal of IDF forces from Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Sunday that the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip be halted until Hamas agrees to resume the release of hostages held in Gaza. Later that day, Israeli media outlets reported that Jerusalem has drafted a plan to pressure Hamas into resuming the hostage releases. According to Channel 14, Energy Minister Eli Cohen (Likud) is set to formally propose to the Israeli cabinet that Israel cut off Gaza from Israel's electric grid. Following the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7th, Israel cut Gaza off from its electric grid, leaving the coastal enclave reliant on electric generators, leading to rolling blackouts. Last July, however, Israel resumed the transfer of electricity to parts of the Gaza Strip, powering a number of public facilities, including water treatment plants and desalination operations. Should Israel adopt Cohen's plan, it could potentially leave Gaza with total blackouts, once the current supply of fuel has been exhausted. Kan reported that in addition to cutting off Gaza from the electric grid, Jerusalem is considering evacuating the northern Gaza Strip once again, sealing off the area and relocating residents to the Khan Yunis and Rafah districts. Furthermore, Israel is mulling resuming hostilities in the Gaza Strip within a week, including the use of heavy air munitions barred by the Biden administration.
