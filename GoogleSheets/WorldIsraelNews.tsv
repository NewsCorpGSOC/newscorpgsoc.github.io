By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump are expected to meet twice on Tuesday. A working meeting is scheduled for noon and later that evening the world leaders will have a casual dinner along with their spouses White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed at a press conference on Friday.

The letter concludes with, 'It will be my honor to host you as my first foreign leader during my second term.' The meeting comes several weeks after Trump’s inauguration and the beginning of the hostage release deal and Gaza ceasefire The two leaders are likely to discuss the hostage release deal and the likelihood of extended the Gaza ceasefire beyond six weeks. Trump and Netanyahu will also deal with issues concerning Iran and the ceasefire in Lebanon. Trump’s Middle East advisor Steve Witkoff was in Israel last week and met with Netanyahu. Witkoff toured the Netzarim corridor with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer. On Thursday, Witkoff met with the families of hostages and said, 'President Trump sends his best blessings. I just want you to know that the people of the United States are with you.'

Yarden Bibas, Ofer Kalderon, Keith Siegel redeemed after 484 days...	In exchange, Jerusalem on Saturday was set to free 183 Palestinian terrorists—18 serving life sentence, 54 serving lengthy terms and 111 arrested since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. By JNS Yarden Bibas, Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegel were freed on Saturday after 484 days in Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian terrorists handed over Bibas and Kalderon to the Red Cross in Khan Yunis, in the Strip’s south, while Siegel was released in Gaza City. 'The government of Israel is committed to returning all of the hostages and the missing,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office. The statement concluded with a quote from the Bible: 'I will save you from the hands of the wicked and deliver you from the grasp of the cruel' (Jeremiah 15:21). The Hostage and Missing Families Forum issued a statement saying: 'Their release today brings a ray of light in the darkness, offering hope and demonstrating the triumph of the human spirit. Yet their return also reminds us that 79 hostages remain in Gaza, still waiting to be saved. We will not rest until every phase of this deal is completed and every hostage is returned—the living to reunite with their loved ones, and the deceased for proper burial with dignity​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​.' In exchange, Jerusalem on Saturday was set to free 183 Palestinian terrorists—18 serving life sentence, 54 serving lengthy terms and 111 arrested since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre.

Bibas’s wife, Shiri, 33, and their two sons, Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 2, are on the list of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. Hamas, however, has claimed that Shiri and the children have been killed. Kalderon, 54, a dual Israeli-French citizen, was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023, along with his son Erez, 12, and daughter, Sahar, 16. The children were among the 105 captives freed in November 2023 as part of a ceasefire-for-terrorists agreement. Freed hostage Ofer Kalderon meets IDF troops, Feb. 1, 2025.

His wife, Aviva, was among those who returned as part of the November 2023 swap with Hamas. On Thursday, three Israelis—IDF soldier Agam Berger, 20, along with civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80—and five Thais were redeemed from terrorist captivity in Gaza as part of Hamas’s truce with Jerusalem. According to Israeli estimates, there are 79 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 76 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, 175 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 35 bodies, 34 of them taken during the cross-border invasion and that of IDF Lt. Hadar Goldin, which was taken by the Palestinian terrorist group in 2014.

US Secretary of State Rubio: ‘The real test is when Gaza ceasefir...	If the people who are in charge of Gaza are the same guys that created October 7th, then we still have the same problem.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the ultimate challenge in the current conflict with Gaza is the fate of Hamas once the ceasefire phases end. In an interview with Megyn Kelly on Thursday, Rubio addressed the possibility of Hamas remaining in power in the Gaza Strip. 'The core problem here remains, and that is ultimately&#8230; an entity like Hamas, whose expressed purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state, and who is willing to commit horrifying atrocities against civilians,' he said. He called Hamas’s governance of Gaza 'a threat to Israel's national security.' He added, 'What country in the world can be expected to live alongside an enemy armed, capable, and willing to commit horrifying atrocities?' Although Rubio said he approved of the ceasefire deal, he acknowledged that it came at an 'extraordinary cost' and called it 'unfair' that 250 terrorists were released for every Israeli hostage. Rubio also observed, 'But it tells you how much, you know, we value life compared to what the other side, the Hamas animals, view this.' 'The real challenge here is going to be what happens when the ceasefire period expires. Who's going to govern Gaza? Who's going to rebuild Gaza? Who's going to be in charge of Gaza? Because if the people who are in charge of Gaza are the same guys that created October 7th, then we still have the same problem,' he continued. Although he acknowledged the severity of the challenge of post-war Gaza, Rubio also highlighted potential advantages and accomplishments. He expressed hope that the Lebanese government would become more powerful than Hezbollah, that relations between Syria's new regime and Israel would remain stable, and that Iran would be weakened, with most of its proxies defeated. Rubio also expressed hope for normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, despite the Saudis’ insistence on a Palestinian state as a precondition. 'So there's a lot of work to be done there. None of it is certain. All of it is hard, but real opportunities that we couldn't have even imagined 90 days ago,' Rubio concluded.

‘A bad but necessary deal’: Five members of his family were murde...	This is a bad deal, very bad, but the alternative is that much worse,' Almog said. 'We must look ahead, put today aside, and recognize that releasing prisoners serves a greater purpose.' By Debbie Weiss, The Algemeiner While the release of three Israeli hostages on Thursday brought relief and elation across Israel, it also triggered a wave of mixed emotions, especially among victims who saw the terrorists responsible for their suffering set free. One of them is Oran Almog, who was just ten years old when a Palestinian terrorist disguised as a pregnant woman blew up the restaurant he was in, killing five members of his family and leaving him blind. Yet, while Thursday’s release of Sami Jaradat — the mastermind behind the October 2003 massacre of Almog’s family — was a deeply personal blow, the return of hostages remained a necessary step, he said. 'That the terrorist who killed my family will find himself free is deeply painful, heartbreaking even,' he told The Algemeiner. 'But at the same time, I know that even today — especially today — I must set aside my personal pain and focus on the significance of this deal. And the significance is clear. We are getting our hostages home, and that is the only thing that matters.' Almog’s father, Moshe Almog, his younger brother, Tomer, his grandparents Admiral (res.) Ze’ev and Ruth Almog, and his cousin, Asaf, were murdered when the suicide bomber, Hanadi Jaradat, a 29-year-old lawyer from Jenin, managed to get past the security guard of the Maxim restaurant — jointly owned by a Jewish Israeli and an Arab Israeli — and blow herself up. Sixteen other people were also murdered in the attack, among them four children. Almog lost his eyesight, and his mother, sister, and aunt were among the 60 injured Israelis. 'Sami Jaradat’s continued imprisonment will never bring my family back, but his release can bring the hostages back home alive,' Almog explained. Emotional meeting between Agam Berger and her family at Beilinson Hospital in Israel. Photo: Haim Zach (GPO) Almog knows firsthand what it means to be on the receiving end of a hostage-prisoner exchange. Just two weeks after marking the 20th anniversary of the Maxim restaurant attack, another tragedy struck his family. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists brutally murdered Nadav and Yam and abducted Chen, Agam, Gal, and Tal from the Almog-Goldstein family in Kfar Azza. Fifty-one days later, in November 2023, they were released from Hamas captivity in a temporary ceasefire deal. Under the current ceasefire agreement reached earlier this month, Hamas will release a total 33 Israeli hostages, eight of whom are deceased, according to the terrorist group. In exchange, Israel will free over 1,900 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom were serving multiple life sentences on terrorism offenses. Thursday saw the release of three Israelis — including IDF surveillance soldier Agam Berger, 20, and civilians Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80 — and five Thai nationals, who were working in Israeli kibbutzim when they were abducted. 'This is a bad deal, very bad, but the alternative is that much worse,' Almog said. 'We must look ahead, put today aside, and recognize that releasing prisoners serves a greater purpose.' However, Almog expressed hope that Israel would move toward a more decisive and uncompromising approach in its fight against terrorism. 'I sincerely hope that as a country, we will have the wisdom to decisively thwart terrorism,' he said, emphasizing the need to break free from the ongoing cycle of prisoner exchanges. 'I don’t want us to find ourselves trapped in a cycle of releasing terrorists, only for them to return to terror, and then repeat the process again and again,' he added. Almog has previously addressed the UN Security Council, urging action against the so-called 'pay-for-slay' scheme, in which terrorists and their families receive monthly stipends from the Palestinian Authority. The terrorist behind the murder of Almog’s family received $3,000 a month while behind bars, making him almost a millionaire by the time of his release. Still, Almog concluded with a deeply uplifting message for the returning hostages, confident that they would have a chance at a good life, drawing from his own experiences since the terror attack. Oran Almog. Photo: Facebook After his release from the hospital, he began a long rehabilitation process, culminating in third place at the World Blind Sailing Championship with Etgarim, a nonprofit founded by disabled veterans and rehabilitation experts, and supported by the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (IFCJ). He was chosen to light a torch at Israel’s Independence Day ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the state and, despite his disability, insisted on enlisting in the IDF, serving in an elite unit. Today, he is a managing partner at a financial technology fund, works with Etgarim, and shares his story globally through lectures. 'I know the hostages will be able to return, to live, and to live well. With enough support — and a great deal of willpower — it is truly possible to rebuild life, even after the deepest catastrophes,' he said.

Israel in ‘precarious position’ as China cozies up with Iran, exp...	Any notion that China could serve as a viable alternative to the U.S. as a hegemonic guarantor in the region is illusory,' said Zineb Riboua, a research fellow and program manager at the Hudson Institute’s Center for Peace and Security in the Middle East. By Izzy Salant, JNS Israel is in a 'precarious position,' as China has demonstrated a 'clear inclination' to align with Iran and its proxies after Oct. 7, Zineb Riboua, a research fellow and program manager at the Hudson Institute’s Center for Peace and Security in the Middle East, told JNS. Beijing opposes not only the Jewish state but also U.S. allies in the region, according to Riboua. 'This has been evident both rhetorically and practically,' she said. 'Rhetorically, Beijing has framed the United States as the primary culprit for instability in the Middle East, reinforcing anti-American narratives,' she told JNS. 'Practically, by continuing to purchase Iranian oil, China has provided Tehran with critical financial resources, indirectly enabling its network of regional proxies.' Riboua, who recently published a commentary article about 'China’s ambitions in the Middle East and Africa,' told JNS that China’s shift 'places Israel in a precarious position, where it must now recognize that China cannot be relied upon as a strategic partner on a wide range of issues.' 'Beijing’s interests in the region are fundamentally transactional, and while it may seek to deepen economic ties with Israel—particularly in the high-tech sector—it does so primarily to serve its own technological ambitions rather than to foster a genuine partnership,' she said. In the analysis, Riboua wrote, citing U.S. intelligence sources, that China has provided weapons directly to the Houthis in Yemen in exchange for safe passage of Chinese ships. This has, in part, allowed the Houthis to operate even at a limited capacity since Hezbollah’s collapse last year and the regime’s weakened state, according to Riboua. (The Trump administration is taking action to redesignate the Houthis as a terror group.) Experts told JNS in January 2024 that Israel must decrease its reliance on China before Beijing can disrupt vital infrastructure. Bilateral commodities trading (excluding diamonds) between China and Israel peaked at $21 billion in 2022, according to the Institute for National Security Studies, a think tank affiliated with Tel Aviv University. Riboua told JNS that unlike the United States, 'which provides Israel with military, diplomatic and strategic backing, China offers no real security guarantees and does not share Israel’s core geopolitical concerns.' 'It has consistently sided with actors hostile to Israel, whether through its rhetorical alignment with Iran’s anti-Western axis or its economic support that indirectly empowers Israel’s adversaries,' she said. 'Any notion that China could serve as a viable alternative to the U.S. as a hegemonic guarantor in the region is illusory.' But Riboua thinks that China will probably keep intensifying 'its efforts to cultivate closer ties with Israel, particularly in areas of advanced technology, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity—sectors where Israel is a global leader.' 'Beijing’s strategic interest in these domains stems not from a commitment to Israel’s security or prosperity, but rather from its broader ambition to compete with the United States in next-generation technologies,' she said. 'This dynamic places Israel in a delicate position, as it must balance the economic opportunities of engagement with China against the geopolitical risks of empowering a state that ultimately seeks to undermine U.S. influence,' she added.

Agam Berger and other hostages maintained Jewish observance durin...	Liri Albag: 'Despite the difficult conditions and limited options, Agam chose to stay true to her values and her faith.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Agam Berger, the IDF lookout who was released on Thursday, and other hostages maintained religious observance during their captivity in Gaza. On Thursday, eight hostages were released in Gaza, including five Thai workers and three Israelis: Agam Berger, Yehud, and Gadi Moses. Agam Berger was reunited with the four other female IDF lookouts who were released last week: Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19. Liri Albag reported that Agam Berger held fast to her religious observance during her captivity, including keeping kosher and observing Shabbat. 'Despite the difficult conditions and limited options, Agam chose to stay true to her values and her faith,' Liri said. Liri's mother, Merav, said that her daughter did not eat any of the non-kosher meat offered to her during captivity, despite the lack of food. Prior to her daughter's release, Merav Berger requested that if her daughter would be released on Saturday, that those involved and the media should avoid violating Shabbat. 'I will wait for Agam, with G-d's help, when she comes, with as little Shabbat desecration as possible,' she shared. 'From you I ask, those who embrace us and who have gone this entire journey with us, and who have the great merit of bringing our children home - please do not desecrate Shabbat.' In addition to Berger, other released hostages said they refused leavened food during Passover and fasted on Yom Kippur, despite suffering severe malnutrition. For 16 months, Arbel Yehud was kept underground in complete isolation. She also suffered from severe malnutrition and was treated cruelly by her Hamas captors. 'I was alone,' Yehud said after she was freed. Although she was told that her brother, Dolev Yehud, was killed during the October 7th attack, she was unaware of the full extent of the invasion. Videos circulated on social media on Thursday showing a mob of Gaza civilians taunting and harassing hostages as they were being escorted to the Red Cross. One of the most harrowing images was of a frightened Arbel Yehud surrounded by hostile Gazans. Commenting on the video, Yehud said, 'What you saw today—the armed men escorting me—that is just a fraction of the horror.' Gadi Moses, who is 80, said that during his captivity, he focused on the day he would return to rebuild his community of Nir Oz. 'I never broke, I never cried—I just waited for the moment I would be free,' he told his family.

Hamas sends Israel names of hostages slated for release on Saturd...	Hamas propaganda chief Abu Obeida named them Ofer Kalderon, 54, Keith Siegel, 65, and Yarden Bibas, 35, in a post on his official Telegram channel. By JNS Jerusalem has received the names of the three hostages who are set to be released from captivity in the Gaza Strip under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office confirmed on Friday. 'A detailed response will be provided after reviewing the list and updating families,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said. The captives scheduled for release are three men, Hamas propaganda chief Abu Obeida said, naming them as Ofer Kalderon, 54, Keith Siegel, 65, and Yarden Bibas, 35, in a post on his official Telegram channel. The only men set to be released in this first phase of the ceasefire agreement are those aged 50 and above, or who are ill or wounded. Under the terms of the agreement, the Palestinian terrorist group was obligated to release women and children hostages before men. Bibas’s wife, Shiri, 33, and their two young sons, Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 2, are on the list of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the truce. Hamas, however, has claimed that Shiri, Ariel and Kfir have been killed. Siegel is a dual Israeli-American citizen. According to Israeli estimates, there are 82 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 79 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, 172 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 35 bodies, 34 of them taken during the cross-border invasion and that of IDF Lt. Hadar Goldin, which was taken by the Palestinian terrorist group in 2014.

Hamas confirms death of terror chief Mohammed Deif months after I...	Deif is believed to have collaborated closely with the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, managing military operations and coordinating with the group’s top commanders throughout the conflict. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas officially confirmed on Thursday that its military chief, Mohammed Deif, was killed during the Gaza war, almost six months after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported his death. Deif, the architect of Hamas’s military capabilities, is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the terrorist group’s invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — which sparked the Gaza war. Abu Ubaida, a Hamas spokesperson, also reported the deaths of Deif’s deputy, Khan Younis Brigade commander Rafa Salama, as well as senior operatives Marwan Issa, Ghazi Abu Tama’a, Raad Thabet, Ahmed Ghandour, and Ayman Nofal. According to the IDF, Deif was killed in an airstrike in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on July 13 of last year. Following weeks of intelligence assessments, Israeli authorities gathered evidence to confirm Deif’s death before publicly announcing it in early August. 'IDF fighter jets struck in the area of Khan Yunis, and … it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike,' the military said. 'His elimination serves the objectives of the war and demonstrates Israel’s ability to carry out targeted strikes with precision.' At the time, Hamas neither confirmed nor denied Deif’s death, but one official, Ezzat Rashaq, stated that any announcements regarding the deaths of its leaders would be made solely by the organization. 'Unless either of them [the Hamas political and military leadership] announces it, no news published in the media or by any other parties can be confirmed,' Rashaq said. In November, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Deif, as well as for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. Deif is believed to have collaborated closely with the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, managing military operations and coordinating with the group’s top commanders throughout the conflict. After Deif’s assassination, then-defense minister Gallant posted an image on social media praising the Israeli military’s accomplishment. 'The assassination of mass murderer Mohammed Deif — ‘Gaza’s Bin Laden’ — is a major step toward dismantling Hamas as a military and governing entity, and achieving the war’s objectives,' he said.

Trump reiterates view that Egypt, Jordan will take in Palestinian...	They will do it. They will do it. They’re gonna do it, OK?' Trump said. 'We do a lot for them, and they’re gonna do it.' By JNS A reporter asked U.S. President Donald Trump during a press conference as the president signed executive orders about Trump’s plan to send Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan. Trump called on Arab nations last week, specifically Egypt and Jordan, to take in more Palestinians to 'clean out' the Gaza Strip. Both King Abdullah II of Jordan and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi have rejected that plan. The reporter asked Trump on Thursday what he planned to do to make the countries take Palestinians in. 'Is there anything you can do to make them do that, I mean tariffs against those countries for example?' the reporter asked. 'They will do it. They will do it. They’re gonna do it, OK?' Trump said. 'We do a lot for them, and they’re gonna do it.' 'What’s amazing about this is that Gaza was Egyptian prior to 1967 and Jordan is majority Palestinian,' wrote the conservative commentator Dave Rubin.

Israeli hostage held in Iraq to be exchanged for Hezbollah terror...	One of the terrorists slated for release is Imad Ahmaz, a senior member of Hezbollah's naval force who was captured three months ago. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov, who was kidnapped in Iraq two years ago, will be released in exchange for eight Hezbollah terrorists. The British website Amwaj reports that, in exchange for Tsurkov, Israel will release Hezbollah terrorists captured since the beginning of the conflict with Lebanon, which began on October 8, 2023, when Hezbollah launched missiles into Israel. One of the terrorists slated for release is Imad Ahmaz, a senior member of Hezbollah's naval force who was captured three months ago in a special operation by Shayetet 13. Last week, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein told Axios that Tsurkov is still alive after two years in captivity, and that Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani is working toward Tsurkov’s release. In a September 2023 interview, the Iraqi Prime Minister said it wasn’t clear who was responsible for abducting Tsurkov. 'The incident damages the reputation of Iraq’s stability and the capability of our security agencies,' he said. Tsurkov’s family stated they spoke with her the day before she was captured, and that nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 'We talked the day before the kidnapping, a completely normal and standard conversation about the interviews she had done, about what was left for her to do,' they said. Tsurkov, a researcher specializing in the Middle East at Princeton University, traveled to Iraq on her Russian passport to conduct research for her doctoral dissertation. However, for Israeli citizens, traveling to enemy nations is prohibited, even with a foreign passport, due to security concerns. Tsurkov was captured by Kataib Hezbollah, a Shiite militia backed by Iran. When the incident occurred, the Israeli Prime Minister’s office issued a statement. 'We hold Iraq responsible for her safety and well-being. She is an academic who visited Iraq on her Russian passport, at her own initiative, to conduct research for her doctorate and academic work on behalf of Princeton University in the US,' the statement said. 'The matter is being handled by the relevant parties in the State of Israel out of concern for Elizabeth Tsurkov’s security and well-being,' it continued.

Despite being left behind, she spent her final moments with the departing captives, braiding their hair as a gesture of love and strength. By Jewish Breaking News In a touching tribute, El Al Airlines employees wore braided hair adorned with yellow ribbons to honor Agam Berger, who was released from Hamas captivity today after 482 days. The gesture carries deep symbolism, as many of the recently freed female hostages returned home with braids done by Agam herself. Despite being left behind, she spent her final moments with the departing captives, braiding their hair as a gesture of love and strength. As an IDF observer stationed at a military base near Gaza, Agam was abducted on October 7, 2023. Her small yet powerful act of kindness during captivity transformed the braid into a symbol of resilience, humanity, and hope. Today, El Al employees proudly continue that legacy, celebrating her return and honoring the strength of all those who endured captivity.

How did so many Thai farmers end up held hostage by Hamas?	Thai ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya said Thursday that there are now more than 38,000 Thai workers in the country. By The Associated Press Five Thai nationals held hostage by Hamas since its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel were released Thursday. They were among 31 Thais taken by the terrorist group, of whom 23 have already been released. Another two have been confirmed dead, and the status of one remaining person is not clear. According to Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, including the two who died in Hamas captivity. They were among tens of thousands of Thai workers in Israel. Here’s a look at what they were doing there. Why are there so many Thais in Israel? Israel once relied heavily on Palestinian workers, but it started bringing in large numbers of migrant workers after the 1987-93 Palestinian revolt known as the first Intifada. Most came from Thailand, and Thais remain the largest group of foreign agricultural laborers in Israel today, earning considerably more than they can at home. Thailand and Israel implemented a bilateral agreement a decade ago to ease the way for workers in the agriculture sector. Israel has come under criticism for the conditions under which the Thai farm laborers work. In a 2015 report, Human Rights Watch said they often were housed in makeshift and inadequate accommodations and 'were paid salaries significantly below the legal minimum wage, forced to work long hours in excess of the legal maximum, subjected to unsafe working conditions and denied their right to change employers.' A watchdog group found more recently that most were still paid below the legal minimum wage. How many Thais work in Israel? There were about 30,000 Thai workers, primarily working on farms, in Israel prior to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas. In the wake of the attack, some 7,000 returned home, primarily on government evacuation flights, but higher wages have continued to attract new arrivals. Thai ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya said Thursday that there are now more than 38,000 Thai workers in the country. What happened after they left? Faced with a labor shortage in the wake of the exodus after the Hamas attack, Israel’s Agriculture Ministry announced incentives to try and attract foreign workers back to evacuated areas. Among other things, it offered to extend work visas and to pay bonuses of about $500 a month. Thailand's Labor Ministry granted 3,966 Thai workers permission to work in Israel in 2024, keeping Israel in the top four destinations for Thais working abroad last year. Thai migrant workers generally come from poorer regions of the country, especially the northeast, and even before the bonuses the jobs in Israel paid many times what they could make at home.

Israel releases Palestinian terrorists after delay over ‘horrific...	In photos and videos shared on social media, Yehud was seen scared as she walked through a chaotic crowd, surrounded by rifle-wielding terrorists, toward the Red Cross convoy. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Israel on Thursday released 110 Palestinian prisoners after delaying the process due to outrage over the chaotic mobbing of freed Israeli hostages at a handover point in Gaza, the Prime Minister’s Office confirmed. 'Israel insists that the lessons be learned and that strict care be taken in the next phases regarding the safe return of our hostages,' the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas freed three Israeli and five Thai hostages after 482 days in captivity on Thursday, with the handovers taking place in both northern and southern Gaza. In the southern city of Khan Younis, armed terrorists transferred the hostages to the Red Cross amid chaos — with people chanting for Hamas’s military wing, known as the al-Qassam Brigades, and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who masterminded the terrorist group’s invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and was killed by Israeli forces a year later — while the hostages looked fearful and struggled to walk through the crowd.

In photos and videos shared on social media, Yehud was seen scared as she walked through a chaotic crowd, surrounded by rifle-wielding terrorists, toward the Red Cross convoy. After the incidents, Netanyahu, along with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, ordered a delay in the release of the Palestinian terrorists scheduled to be freed under the Gaza ceasefire deal with Hamas until the safe exit of hostages in the next phases of the agreement could be assured. Jerusalem demanded that mediators Qatar and Egypt, who helped negotiate the ceasefire, 'guarantee the safety of our hostages,' Netanyahu’s office said in a statement, describing the 'horrific scenes' of Yehud and Mozes being taunted and mobbed. 'This is further proof of the unimaginable cruelty of the Hamas terrorist organization,' the statement continued. Following Netanyahu’s demand, however, 'the mediators have conveyed a commitment, according to which the safe exit of our hostages who are due to be released in the next phases has been assured,' his office said. Earlier on Thursday, Israeli soldier Agam Berger, 20, who was kidnapped from an Israeli military field observers’ base in Nahal Oz, was transferred into Red Cross custody following a Hamas handover ceremony in northern Gaza. All three Israelis were among the 251 hostages who were kidnapped during the Hamas-led rampage across southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were murdered, on Oct. 7, 2023. The five released Thais were all foreign agricultural workers who were also taken hostage during the Oct. 7 onslaught. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) named them as Thaenna Pongsak, Sathian Suwannakhan, Sriaoun Watchara, Saethao Bannawat, and Rumnao Surasak.

During the first 42 days of the agreement, Hamas pledged to release 33 hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, where they have largely been imprisoned for involvement in terrorist activities. Of those set to be released in the coming weeks, 32 were sentenced to life and 48 were serving long sentences, including Zakaria Zubeidi, Mohammad Abu Warda, and Sami Jaradat, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. Zubeidi, who led the Palestinian faction Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in Jenin and briefly escaped from Israel’s Gilboa Prison in 2021, will not be deported due to his conviction on terrorism offenses rather than murder, and is expected to return to Ramallah. Abu Warda and Jaradat, responsible for attacks that killed 66 Israelis in the late 1990s and early 2000s, are scheduled to be deported and banned from re-entering Israeli territory The post Israel releases Palestinian terrorists after delay over ‘horrific’ Gaza mobbing of freed hostages appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/israel-releases-palestinian-terrorists-after-delay-over-horrific-gaza-mobbing-of-freed-hostages/	2025-01-31T02:11:28-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/F250130FFF002-scaled.jpg
IDF soldier killed, four wounded fighting terrorists in Jenin	Liam Hazi is the first Israeli casualty in 'Operation Iron Wall,' which the IDF initiated on Jan. 21 in Judea and Samaria. By JNS An Israeli soldier was killed in combat and four others were wounded on Thursday during a firefight with terrorists in Jenin in Samaria, the Israel Defense Forces said. Staff Sgt. Liam Hazi, 20, of the Kfir Brigade’s Haruv reconnaissance unit is the first Israeli casualty in 'Operation Iron Wall,' which the IDF initiated on Jan. 21 in Judea and Samariaagainst terrorist networks. Of the four wounded, one was severely hurt, and the three others sustained light wounds, according to the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit. Hazi’s unit was conducting house searches when it encountered a group of armed terrorists who opened fire on the troops at close range, the report said. The terrorists escaped. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the IDF Spokesperson, said in a statement: 'We mourn with the family and accompany them in these difficult hours. We continue to act resolutely against terrorism everywhere, including in Judea and Samaria. Tonight, too, we remember those who fell in the battles on Oct. 7, 2023, and the heavy price paid by IDF regular and reserve fighters throughout the war.' Earlier on Thursday, the IDF said the Israeli Air Force had carried out a strike against terrorists in Samaria on Wednesday, killing 10 of them. Another terrorist, Col. Kassem Aklik, a senior officer in the Palestinian Authority security forces and a member of the Fatah movement of P.A. chief Mahmoud Abbas, was killed by ground troops on Thursday, the army added. The strike is a 'direct continuation of the intensive counter-terrorism activity of the Shin Bet and the IDF against terrorist infrastructures in the northern Samaria region,' read a statement by the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit. Aklik was killed in Nablus, the army said. He had planned several attacks against Israelis and had tried to escape when officers from the Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit approached a building where he was staying, the statement said. Aklik was carrying a pistol, according to the statement. The officers shot and killed him.

Netanyahu spokesman: hostage deal ‘not a failure, but it came at ...	In exchange for 33 Israeli hostages in the first part of the deal, 735 Palestinian prisoners will be set loose from Israeli jails, some of whom have killed Israelis. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Omer Dostri, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s spokesman, told The Jerusalem Post on Thursday that the hostage release deal was not a failure but admitted it came at a price. Just a few days before Netanyahu's departure to Washington to meet with US President Donald Trump, Dostri said, 'I wouldn’t call the deal a failure, but it isn’t perfect – it came at a cost.' He emphasized that the security cabinet's main priority is the release of the hostages. 'Once that is achieved, we will ensure that Hamas is no longer in Gaza,' he said. According to the agreement, 33 Israeli hostages will be released in the first phase of the deal, mainly women, children, the sick, and the elderly. In exchange, 735 Palestinian prisoners will be set free from Israeli jails, some of whom have killed Israelis and are serving life sentences. When The Jerusalem Post asked why Israel seems to be paying a higher price to release these hostages than it did in November 2023, when 100 hostages were freed, Dostri replied: 'In the early days of the war, Hamas was under tremendous pressure – the Biden administration and the international community were fully behind Israel,' he explained. 'Since then, the Biden administration stepped back and placed pressure on Israel, giving Hamas a tailwind. Only recently have we begun reversing that trend, applying military pressure in northern Gaza, while Trump has also pressured Hamas,' Dostri added. He said one of the biggest mistakes the Biden administration made was publicly displaying a shipment of weapons to Israel prior to the IDF entering Rafah. 'I see that as a moral disgrace and a serious operational mistake,' he said. 'If the goal is to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, how do you justify withholding arms from Israel?' Regarding US President Donald Trump, Dostri said, 'His statements continue to show strong support for Israel. There are people in his administration who are very pro-Israel, very hawkish in our favor. We expect a sympathetic government and are happy to cooperate – we can achieve great things with him in the Middle East.' Dostri said that when Netanyahu meets with Trump in the Oval Office, the two are likely to discuss the ongoing ceasefire and hostage negotiations, Iran, the potential normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia, and Trump’s proposal to relocate Gazans to Egypt and Jordan during Gaza's rebuilding phase after the war.

Mossad head concerned Gaza cleanup efforts may damage dead hostag...	Barnea said, 'It’s awful. It could cause more cases like Ron Arad,' referring to the Israeli Air Force officer who was captured in Lebanon in 1986 and declared dead in 2008. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News At a meeting with the families of hostages, Mossad chief David Barnea expressed concern that bulldozers used to clear the wreckage in Gaza might damage the bodies of deceased hostages. Speaking to the families on Monday, Barnea said, 'It’s awful. It could cause more cases like Ron Arad,' referring to the Israeli Air Force officer who was captured in Lebanon in 1986 and, after no information was provided about his condition, was declared dead in 2008. 'We have a responsibility to bring everyone home,' Barnea added. At the meeting, Barnea also informed the families that the list of 33 hostages slated for release in phase one of the current agreement was created immediately after the hostage-release deal in November 2023. The circumstances for many of the hostages have changed since November 23, although there has been limited information about their condition. Hamas reported to Israel early this week that 8 of the 33 captives slated for release are dead. Israel has demanded information and clarity on the status of hostage Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir. The first phase of the hostage-release deal was meant to prioritize women, children, the elderly, and the ill. Although Shiri Bibas and her children were on the list of hostages slated for release in the initial stage, their absence from previous releases has raised concerns. Hamas reported that living hostages would return in the first part of the agreement, and the bodies of deceased captives would be handed over later. Last week, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari expressed 'grave concerns' over the fate of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir. The Israeli government is insisting on clarity regarding their status to provide answers to their family. Relatives of the Bibas family said that their 'world came crashing down' when Shiri and her children were not included in the list of hostages slated for release on Saturday.

Dutch parliament conditions Palestinian NGO funding on recognitio...	This week’s resolution also came two months after a violent attack in Amsterdam against visiting Israeli soccer fans by a mob of rioters, many of them Muslim. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner The Dutch Parliament passed a resolution on Tuesday to make funding for Palestinian NGOs depend on their recognition of Israel’s right to exist. The Dutch House of Representatives passed a resolution by a margin of 70-67 requiring greater transparency from NGOs, including detailed information about board members and funded projects, while ensuring that subsidized organizations align with the Netherlands’ foreign policy, including recognition of the state of Israel. The motion also addresses terror ties, citing the Netherlands’ decision to halt subsidies to the Ramallah-based Union of Agricultural Work Committee (UAWC) following a terror attack by employees with ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), an internationally designated terrorist organization. Last year, Dutch lawmakers discovered that the previous government had continued funding a terror-linked NGO, despite knowing they had subsidized the salaries of two Palestinians convicted in the 2019 murder of a 17-year-old Israeli girl. These two Palestinians were members of the PFLP, while also being employed by the UAWC, which has received over 20 million euros in funding from the Dutch government over the past decade. In 2020, the government suspended funding to the UAWC pending an investigation into the 2019 bombing. This week’s resolution also came two months after a violent attack in Amsterdam against visiting Israeli soccer fans by a mob of rioters, many of them Muslim. Olga Deutsch, vice president of NGO Monitor, an independent Jerusalem-based research organization, explained that the lack of vetting and oversight mechanisms has allowed billions of euros to be diverted to antisemitic, anti-Israel, and terror-affiliated organizations. 'The need to change these practices became even more salient following the Hamas massacre of Oct. 7, 2023,' she told the Algemeiner. Deutsch pointed out that the Dutch government supported numerous organizations that misused aid funds, with a large portion being directed toward political warfare against Israel and the global Jewish community. This 'endangers the safety of global Jewish communities … as it radicalizes discourse, spreads fear, and promotes narratives that translate into attacks against Jews,' she added. Last year, NGO Monitor presented a report to the Dutch Parliament warning that foreign aid to Palestinian organizations was being misused for terrorism and radicalism. NGO Monitor revealed that from 2021 to 2027, Dutch government grantees included NGOs involved in anti-Israel campaigns. These included Al Mezan, which engages in legal action against Israel and has ties to PFLP and Hamas; the Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR), which collaborates with terror groups such as Hamas, PFLP, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ); and Oxfam-Novib, which, along with other organizations, sued the Netherlands in 2023 to stop arms exports to Israel. Deutsch emphasized that the latest resolution is crucial as global discussions unfold about Gaza’s future post-ceasefire, urging the international community to rethink and restructure aid distribution. 'The donor community must ensure that aid is not diverted to Hamas and other terror organizations, as was the case before Oct. 7,' she said. During this legislative session, the Dutch Parliament also adopted a motion urging the government to support Gaza reconstruction plans and fundraising efforts. However, lawmakers rejected several proposals related to Israel and the Palestinians, including one to tighten labeling and tariff enforcement on Israeli settlements. They also denied motions to link Dutch aid for Gaza’s reconstruction to Dutch companies and restrict it to civilian infrastructure, as well as to provide January funding to UNRWA, the controversial UN agency for Palestinian refugees that has come under fire for several links to Hamas.

UNRWA activities become illegal in Israel	According to Israel, hundreds of UNRWA workers have engaged in terrorism in recent years, including the killers of Yonatan Samerano, an IDF soldier slain on Oct. 7, 2023, whose body was taken to Gaza. By Canaan Lindor, JNS Laws that ban UNRWA in Israel went into effect on Thursday, barring the United Nations aid agency for Palestinians from maintaining a presence or activities in that country, and prohibiting Israeli officials from engaging in contact with it. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel welcomed the development. 'UNRWA lies at the heart of the Arab-Jewish conflict. It has always been a non-neutral political organization, and it actually paved the way for October 7th. Any other country in the world would have shut down such an organization within 24 hours of its employees having massacred civilians. I will continue to do everything in my power to bring about the complete closure of the organization,' she tweeted. On Oct. 28, the Knesset passed, by large majorities, two laws banning UNRWA following the exposure of UNRWA staff complicity in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, and despite pressure from the United States and other countries against the move. Three months later, the laws have come into effect. The ban is by far the most robust step ever taken by Israel against UNRWA, whose largest donors have been the United States and the European Union. The agency has for decades been accused of providing cover and income to Palestinian terrorists while undermining peace efforts, including via its schools’ curriculum. Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Aryeh King celebrated the development by uncorking a bottle of sparkling wine outside the shuttered UNRWA office in Jerusalem’s northeastern Ma’alot Dafna neighborhood. 'It’s a happy, special and historic day,' he said, popping open the bottle to cheers from supporters. Shai Glick from the B’tsalmo human rights group attended the event and spray-painted over the sign of the former UNRWA offices. UNRWA, or the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, 'has an impressive-sounding name, but it’s just a terrorist group,' Glick said. Engaged in terrorism According to Israel, hundreds of UNRWA workers have engaged in terrorism in recent years, including the killers of Yonatan Samerano, an IDF soldier slain on Oct. 7, 2023, whose body was taken to Gaza. Israel identified one of them as UNRWA social worker Faisal Ali Mussalem al Naami. On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump temporarily suspended U.S. foreign aid to UNRWA, pending reviews of existing development programs. Several countries froze their funding to UNRWA, which usually enjoy a budget of about $1 billion annually. Only the U.S. and New Zealand have not reinstated their funding. Switzerland reinstated it only partially, according to UN Watch, a watchdog group based in Geneva. On Saturday, Israel notified the United Nations it must evacuate all UNRWA premises by Jan. 30. UN Watch wrote in a recent report that UNRWA officials meet 'routinely' with Lebanese and Gazan terrorist groups, 'mutually praise each other for ‘cooperation’ and describe each other as ‘partners.’' Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of UNRWA, said that the agency will continue to deliver on its mandate until it physically cannot do so. UNRWA caters to several millions of people it defines as refugees in Judea and Samaria, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Israel’s laws may complicate its ability to bring goods and staff into Judea and Samaria and Gaza. Through UNRWA, the United Nations employs a unique refugee definition for Palestinians. UNRWA defines as refugees not only those who fled the war in 1948 but their descendants in perpetuity, until a 'just solution' emerges for their status. The United Nations has a different definition for all other refugees, who cannot give the title to their descendants and often lose it when they are naturalized elsewhere. Critics of the UNRWA definition say it’s designed to perpetuate the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

Barnard names new head of women’s center: Anti-Israel gender prof...	When Columbia slapped suspensions on students who stormed the building and invited police to maintain order on campus, meanwhile, Jordan-Young rallied to their defense. By Jessica Costescu and Jessica Schwalb, The Washington Free Beacon Rebecca Jordan-Young, a gender studies professor at Barnard College, is a member of the school's Faculty for Justice in Palestine chapter. Last spring, she volunteered to serve as a 'protest marshal,' part of a group of faculty members and staff who helped student radicals secure the perimeter of their illegal encampment and stood by as those students stormed a Columbia University campus building, photos obtained by the Washington Free Beacon show. Now, she will lead the Barnard Center for Research on Women. Barnard named Jordan-Young the center's interim director on Friday. The role opened up after Premilla Nadasen, a Barnard history professor, resigned last month, citing her discontent with stricter campus event rules and 'surveillance cameras' implemented in the wake of the illegal encampments that roiled Barnard and Columbia. Jordan-Young's appointment ensures that another ally of anti-Israel students will lead the center, which was established in 1971 to 'assure that women can live and work in dignity, autonomy, and equality.' It has since expanded its scope to encompass a wider array of social justice projects, including the 'gay liberation movement,' the 'histories of racism, slavery, and colonialism' in the field of botany, and the 'intersections of social reproduction, racial capitalism, care, the state, and liberatory social change.' Anti-Israel and pro-Hamas activism is also included within that scope. Under Nadasen, the Center for Research on Women was advertised as the host of the infamous 'Resistance 101' event held last March, which featured a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terror group and saw speakers explicitly call for terrorism against Jews. When a doctoral student complained to Columbia, organizers moved the event. A flyer advertising last year's 'Resistance 101' event. Though Nadasen later denied any affiliation to 'Resistance 101,' her successor has offered explicit support for Barnard and Columbia's campus radicals. Photographs obtained by the Free Beacon show Jordan-Young standing by as student radicals stormed Hamilton Hall in April. In one photo, Jordan-Young is shown standing just steps away from a group of protesters who blocked a side entrance to the building. In a separate video, Jordan-Young is shown conversing with other faculty members as students occupy Hamilton Hall. Metadata from the video show a timestamp of April 30 at approximately 2 a.m., shortly after students first stormed the building. Jordan-Young pictured near a crowd of students during the Hamilton Hall storming. Jordan-Young wore one of the neon vests associated with 'protest marshals,' a group of volunteer faculty members and staff who supported encampment participants by standing guard at the encampment's entrance. A photograph taken on April 29 shows Jordan-Young doing just that. Jordan-Young (far-left corner) helps guard the encampment entrance. When Columbia slapped suspensions on students who stormed the building and invited police to maintain order on campus, meanwhile, Jordan-Young rallied to their defense. She went on strike in May in solidarity with those students, with the Faculty for Justice in Palestine group she belongs to saying its members would 'not return to campus nor engage remotely for administrative service work … until police are removed from our campus.' In her own statement, Jordan-Young said the 'protests on campus were peaceful until the NYPD was called in.' Months later, in September, Jordan-Young's anti-Israel faculty group held a 'Barnard Community in Crisis: Faculty Teach-In.' Jordan-Young dressed in a pink wig and clown makeup and called herself 'Both Sides Bozo,' a reference to a university that she said is all about 'facts and objectivity and established things and not, like, ethics, which really has no place in a university or college.' Jordan-Young as 'Both Sides Bozo.' Shoshana Aufzien, a freshman at Barnard, witnessed that event in person. Jordan-Young's appointment to run the Center for Research on Women, she said, 'undermines [the] institution’s credibility.' Alon Levin, a Ph.D. student at Columbia’s School of Engineering, echoed that assessment. 'In a race to destroy any lasting legitimacy the Columbia brand maintains, the Barnard Center for Research on Women is undoubtedly a top contender,' he told the Free Beacon. The Barnard Center for Research on Women and Jordan-Young did not respond to requests for comment. Jordan-Young’s appointment comes as a new wave of anti-Israel radicalism sweeps Columbia. Student activists, for example, kicked off the spring semester by storming an Israeli history class. They targeted Jews in the class with anti-Semitic flyers that glorified Hamas, depicted a trampled Star of David, and called for violence. One flyer stated, 'THE ENEMY WILL NOT SEE TOMORROW' and featured an upside-down triangle—a symbol Hamas uses to denote Israeli targets—to spell 'TOMORROW.' The flyer depicted a truck full of Hamas terrorists brandishing RPGs and machine guns. Last week, Columbia identified and suspended one student activist involved. Days later, on Monday, the school announced that it identified two more participants from an 'affiliated institution' and referred those participants to their 'home institution for further investigation and discipline.' Columbia's affiliated institutions include Barnard, Union Theological Seminary, and Teachers College.

Netanyahu condemns ‘unimaginable cruelty’ of Hamas after hostages...	Otzma Yehudit Party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir called the display a 'horror' scene demonstrating that 'this is not a total victory but a total failure, in a reckless deal like no other.' By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday condemned the crowds of Gazans that mobbed three Israeli hostages as they were being released by Hamas. 'I view the shocking scenes during the release of our hostages as very serious,' wrote Netanyahu after the release of Arbel Yehud, Gadi Mozes, Agam Berger and five Thai citizens, all of whom were abducted to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. 'This is further proof of the unimaginable cruelty of the Hamas terrorist organization. I demand that the mediators ensure that such horrific scenes do not recur, and guarantee the safety of our hostages. Those who dare harm our hostages do so at their own peril,' Netanyahu wrote. Footage from the release shows massive crowds, apparently in a state of jubilation, swarming around cars transporting the hostages and around the Hamas terrorists escorting the Israelis from the vehicles. Otzma Yehudit Party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir, a critic of the ceasefire deal who recently took his party out of the government because of it, called the display a 'horror' scene demonstrating that 'this is not a total victory but a total failure, in a reckless deal like no other. The government, he continued, 'could have withheld humanitarian aid, fuel, electricity and water from the bloodthirsty mob that is now trying to lynch our hostages and crushed them militarily.' Israel has agreed to release 110 terrorists in exchange for the latest group of hostages, including Zakaria Zubeidi, Mohammad Abu Warda and Sami Jaradat, according to Channel 12. Zubeidi led Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the Samaria city of Jenin and briefly escaped from Israel’s high-security Gilboa Prison in September 2021. Since Zubeidi was not convicted of murder but of other terror offenses, he will not be deported and is expected to be released back to Samaria. The deal that Hamas and Israel initiated on Jan. 19 was for the release of more than 90 hostages for close to 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Israel has agreed to redeploy in the Gaza Strip and allow the repopulation of the area’s north. The first phase of the deal involves the release of 33 hostages in exchange for more than 700 Palestinian prisoners and more than 1,000 detainees over a 42-day period. Of the 33 Israel hostages on the first phase list, 10 have returned so far.

Arbel Yehud, Agam Berger and Gadi Mozes home after 482 days in ca...	An Israeli security source told the country’s Kan News that Jerusalem’s political echelon had decided to freeze the release of the Arab terrorists in response to the way Yehud and Mozes were treated on Thursday. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Three Israelis and five Thais were redeemed from terrorist captivity in the Gaza Strip on Thursday as part of Hamas’s truce with Jerusalem, 482 days after they were taken captive during the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. Israeli civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80, were handed over by Hamas to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross on Thursday afternoon in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis. Mozes was taken from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz alongside his wife, Margalit, who was one of the first captives released in the 2023 truce. The five released Thais—all foreign workers who taken hostage during the Oct. 7 cross-border assault—were named by the Israel Defense Forces as Thaenna Pongsak, Sathian Suwannakhan, Sriaoun Watchara, Saethao Bannawat and Rumnao Surasak. 'According to information provided by the Red Cross, seven hostages, including an Israeli male and female hostage and five foreign nationals, were handed over to it and are making their way to the IDF and [Israel Security Agency] forces in the Gaza Strip,' the military confirmed. The army subsequently confirmed that the seven returnees have 'now crossed the border into Israeli territory with IDF and ISA forces.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that Jerusalem appealed to mediators Qatar and Egypt following the 'horrific scenes' of Yehud and Mozes being publicly taunted by their captors and a mob of thousands of Palestinians as they were transferred to the Red Cross. 'This is further proof of the unimaginable cruelty of the Hamas terrorist organization,' Jerusalem’s Prime Minister’s Office stated, demanding that Doha and Cairo work to 'guarantee the safety of our hostages.' Yehud and Mozes had been held by Iranian-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists who participated in the Oct. 7 attack alongside Hamas. Islamic Jihad issued a statement on Thursday morning saying that it had 'completed the procedures for handing over the hostages Arbel Yehud and Gadi Mozes,' in what Hebrew media interpreted as the terror group having transferred the two to Hamas ahead of their release. Earlier on Thursday, Israeli soldier Agam Berger, 20, who was kidnapped from the IDF field observers’ base in Nahal Oz, was transferred into Red Cross custody following a Hamas handover ceremony in Gaza’s north. 'Agam Berger, accompanied by IDF and [Israel Security Agency] forces, recently crossed the border into the territory of the State of Israel,' the military stated. Berger was reunited with her family at the reception point near the border before being evacuated to a hospital, it said. 'Thank God we have reached this moment and our heroine Agam has returned to us after 482 days in the hands of the enemy,' the family said in a statement after the reunion. 'Our girl is strong, believing and brave.' 'We would like to thank the security forces and the entire people of Israel for all the support and prayers,' added the family’s statement. Netanyahu’s office stated, 'The government, together with all security officials, will accompany her and her family. The Israeli government is committed to returning all of the hostages and the missing.' The PMO statement concluded with a quote from the Bible: 'And I will return the captivity of My people Israel' (Amos 9:14). Dr. Lena Koren Feldman, director of Rabin Medical Center’s Beilinson Hospital, told Israel’s Channel 12 News that the four IDF soldiers kidnapped alongside Berger and who were released by Hamas on Saturday screamed with excitement when they saw her being freed. As Berger was being released, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, met in Jerusalem with Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Shas Party leader Aryeh Deri to discuss the implementation of the hostage deal. Witkoff, who arrived in the Jewish state on Wednesday, met on Thursday afternoon with the four previously freed soldiers at Beilinson Hospital. The presidential envoy also visited 'Hostage Square' in central Tel Aviv. Jerusalem is preparing to free several high-profile Palestinian terrorists in exchange for the hostages, Hebrew media reported on Wednesday. Among the 110 terrorists scheduled to be released are Zakaria Zubeidi, Mohammad Abu Warda and Sami Jaradat, according to Channel 12. Zubeidi led Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the Samaria city of Jenin and briefly escaped from Israel’s high-security Gilboa Prison in 2021. Since Zubeidi was not convicted of murder but of other terror offenses, he will not be deported and is expected to be released back to Samaria. Abu Warda and Jaradat were responsible for terrorist attacks that combined killed 66 Israelis in the late ’90s and early 2000s. Both are scheduled to be deported and banned from returning to Israeli territory. However, an Israeli security source told the country’s Kan News that Jerusalem’s political echelon had decided to freeze the release of the Arab terrorists in response to the way Yehud and Mozes were treated on Thursday. The IDF said on Thursday morning that its Judea and Samaria Division had completed 'preparations for the next wave of released terrorists, by reinforcing defense at checkpoints and in various sectors.' The IDF voted to take immediate action against expected 'disturbances and terror activities' surrounding the release of terrorists into the area. The Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) also made 'warning calls' to families of terrorists who are expected to be released, it noted.

Gazans who sped north are deciding on their own to go back south	There is shelter and food for them in the south, whereas the center and northern areas of Gaza are destroyed, they noted. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Some of the over 300,000 Gazans who sped north to get to their hometowns as soon as the IDF allowed them to cross the former no-go zone of the Netzarim Corridor just a few days ago are regretting that decision and have begun returning south, Abu Ali Express reported Thursday. The Israeli Telegram channel ran a translated Arab news clip from Tuesday, where a female interviewer spoke with young men striding along the A-Rashid coastal road that was serving as the main route for Gazans to head back home in the north – but they were using it to go in the opposite direction. When she asked where they were from, they said they had been in the south, they walked to their old neighborhood in the north, and were now returning to the south. 'We walked there yesterday, and today we are coming back,' one told her. When she asked what the atmosphere was like 'in Gaza [City],' and how they found the going, they answered immediately, 'Destruction, complete destruction.' They had no interest in staying under such circumstances, with their houses gone and 'huge sand dunes in their place,' they said. One commented, 'We’ll leave it in God’s hands,' while another young man, with a more practical bent, said, 'Find people a solution. Where should we go?' 'We want to live, sleep, we want to find shelter&#8230; there is no shelter there,' he added, so they were 'returning home,' referring to where they had stayed safe over the course of the war. 'That’s the best solution,' he declared. When the interviewer asked if they really thought that it was the right move to return, he responded, 'Yes, yes. Now that is our place, the one we want to return to.' A whole family then passed by on a horse-drawn cart and when she called out, 'Are you also returning?' they answered, 'Yes, [because] there’s no water, no nothing.' Several people could also be heard saying off-camera to 'Open the crossing points' for them, meaning the border crossings to allow them to leave the Gaza Strip. The only other country besides Israel that has a land border with Gaza is Egypt, and it has kept its gates very firmly shut against any kind of mass influx of Gazan refugees for the entire war. Over the last few days, U.S. President Donald Trump has brought up the idea to both Egyptian and Jordanian leaders of allowing entry to tens of thousands of Gazans at least until the devastation of war can be cleared somewhat, and has been firmly turned down. The interviewer was thrown by what she had seen and heard, saying, 'This is indeed an unusual situation, dear viewers, the return of those who had been uprooted from Gaza City going back to the places they had left' in the south. She specifically named the Al Mouassi safe zone, which was set up by Israel along the coast near Khan Yunis some nine months ago and is well supplied with humanitarian aid. She also noted that there was no problem to walk in either direction on the coast, in which no officials or soldiers of any kind could be seen.

Agam Berger’s separate release in Jabalya used for propaganda pur...	The stage where the IDF observer was taken to be displayed was decorated with pictures of the terrorists’ supposed victory over various IDF divisions. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The separate release Thursday morning of IDF observer Agam Berger was carefully staged for propaganda purposes by Gazan terrorists, according to a report in The Jerusalem Post following the event. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) took Berger to Jabalya to be turned over to the Red Cross, a city that has been the site of months of fighting over several rounds during the course of the war between the IDF and the terrorists. It wanted specifically to declare victory over the IDF there, analyst Seth Frantzman wrote, and decorated the stage where it displayed Berger accordingly. Printed in English and Arabic on a huge poster that formed the backdrop of the stage were slogans such as 'Gaza is the graveyard of the criminal Zionists,' 'Palestine – The victory of the oppressed people vs the Nazi Zionists,' and The Palestinians fighters of freedom will always be the victories [sic].' The bunting in front contained childish approximations of the logos of various IDF divisions and brigades that had fought in Gaza in general and Jabalya in particular, with images of defeat skewering them. Thus, the Givati symbol of a red fox and a sword was turned into a running animal with a sword stabbing it through the back and the caption 'Jabalya is the grave of Givati.' While the IDF did suffer a few dozen losses in Jabalya, thousands of terrorists were killed and captured in the fighting in the city. The image labeled 'Kfir,' another infantry division, had a sword buried in the helmet worn by a skull, while yellow, blue and red lines that form part of the Nachal symbol were shown being scythed in half by a sickle named Beit Hanoun, as if that brigade’s soldiers were defeated in that town, which is the opposite of what really happened there. The terrorists misspelled each one of these divisions’ names, which could be considered an unprofessional touch. Berger was led onto the stage by dozens of uniformed, masked terrorists wearing green headbands who had given her some kind of certificate of release to hold, exactly like other hostages. Black-clad terrorists holding long guns stood on stage and some filmed the proceedings, in which Berger was made to smile for the cameras and an audience of Gazans that was kept at a distance before a stylized handover was enacted and she was whisked away by Red Cross vehicles and transported to safety in Israel. The two other Israeli hostages released Thursday, Gadi Mozes and Arbel Yehoud, and the five Thai hostages, had a seemingly much more frightening time before their release. Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas jointly took them to Khan Younis to be freed close to the destroyed home of assassinated Hamas head Yahya Sinwar. Huge crowds formed and their captors were hard-pressed to open the doors of the cars they had arrived in, needing to push back their fellow citizens. Arab media showed Yehoud completely surrounded by helmeted terrorists who were walking her very slowly toward the Red Cross cars, literally pushing through a huge shouting and jeering mob, in order to get to a Red Cross car.

Almisshal was reportedly put in charge of two separate hostage release ceremonies held in the Gaza Strip after Hamas reached a temporary ceasefire deal with Israel. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon A journalist with the Qatar-funded Al Jazeera news network reportedly produced videos for Hamas documenting its recent release of Israeli hostages. The reporter, Tamer Almisshal, is said to have orchestrated elaborate propaganda ceremonies on the terror group’s behalf, according to Israel’s i24 News. Almisshal is listed on Al Jazeera’s website as a 'producer and presenter of investigative programmes.' He began working at the Doha-based news network in 2008 and spent time as a correspondent in the Gaza Strip before relocating to Qatar. Almisshal is said to moonlight as a producer for Hamas’s propaganda arm, i24 said in a Hebrew-language report televised on Wednesday. He is one of several Al Jazeera journalists alleged to work with the terror group and even serve in its ranks. Israel shuttered Al Jazeera’s offices in May 2024, deeming it a national security threat. Breaking: Senior Al Jazeera Journalist Produced Hamas' Hostage Release Ceremonies According to @BaruchYedid in an exposé for @i24NEWS_HE, the Qatari network's Tamer Mishel produced the ceremonies as well as the recent documentary, 'What is Hidden is Greater,' in which Al… pic.twitter.com/SAyCG3CAdC &mdash; Eitan Fischberger (@EFischberger) January 29, 2025 Almisshal was reportedly put in charge of two separate hostage release ceremonies held in the Gaza Strip after Hamas reached a temporary ceasefire deal with Israel. The Al Jazeera reporter was put 'in charge of the stage, the banners, the narrative, and the idea of dressing the female soldiers in IDF uniforms,' according to an English translation of i24’s report. 'He is the one Hamas designated for this task.' Hamas's elaborate ceremonies drew widespread attention in Israel and raised concerns that the terror group remains a competent fighting force, even after more than a year of war. The Israeli report suggests that the ceremonies were part of a propaganda push by Hamas to demonstrate strength and reassert its control over Gaza. 'So while in Israel we’re racking our brains: Is this staged? Is this real? Does this indicate Hamas’s strength? This is a full theatrical performance, orchestrated by one of Al Jazeera’s most skilled reporters, Tamer Almisshal, originally from Gaza,' i24 said. When the first group of Israeli hostages were released earlier this month, throngs of armed Hamas soldiers surrounded an ambulance delivering the captives back to Israel. The terrorists had traded in their civilian clothes for military fatigues, sending a message to Israel that Hamas is no longer hiding in tunnels and civilian homes. As part of this power play, Hamas released carefully tailored images and videos meant to convey its strength. Almisshal was quoted at the time as saying that Hamas intentionally chose to parade through Gaza's Saraya Square during the first prisoner swap. 'This area, heavily targeted by Israeli operations, sends a message: You didn’t break us—Hamas is still here,' he said. Almisshal is also said to be the producer behind a recent Al Jazeera documentary on Hamas that featured exclusive footage of the terror group’s former leader, Yahya Sinwar. Almisshal reportedly maintains a relationship with Ezzedine Haddad, a commander in Hamas’s armed wing responsible for overseeing the prisoner swaps with Israel. Al Jazeera did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Israeli report. Multiple Al Jazeera journalists celebrated Hamas’s Oct. 7 terror spree and were reportedly embedded with militants as they stormed the Jewish state that morning. 'This is the day that restored the honor and prestige to [our] nation,' Al Jazeera presenter Jamal Rayyan tweeted—and subsequently deleted—at the time. The Doha-based outlet also came under fire for publishing a comedy skit that mocked the Oct. 7 attack. When Israel banned the outlet from operating in the country, officials accused Al Jazeera of 'broadcasting propaganda in the service of Hamas, in Arabic and English, to viewers around the world, and even passing sensitive information to the enemy.'

Passenger jet with 64 aboard collides with Army helicopter while ...	President Donald Trump said he had been 'fully briefed on this terrible accident' and, referring to the passengers, added, 'May God Bless their souls.' By The Associated Press An American Airlines jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members collided Wednesday with an Army helicopter while landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, prompting a large search-and-rescue operation in the nearby Potomac River. There were multiple fatalities, according to a person familiar with the matter, but the precise number of victims was unclear as rescue crews hunted for any survivors. Three soldiers were onboard the helicopter, an Army official said. There was no immediate word on the cause of the collision, but all takeoffs and landings from the airport were halted as dive teams scoured the site and helicopters from law enforcement agencies across the region flew over the scene in methodical search for bodies. 'We are going to recover our fellow citizens,' District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a somber news conference at the airport Thursday morning in which she declined to say how many bodies had been recovered. Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said, 'When one person dies it’s a tragedy, but when many, many, many people die it’s an unbearable sorrow.' President Donald Trump said he had been 'fully briefed on this terrible accident' and, referring to the passengers, added, 'May God Bless their souls.' Passengers on the flight included a group of figure skaters, their coaches and family members who were returning from a development camp that followed the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. 'We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’ families closely in our hearts,' U.S. Figure Skating said in a statement. The Federal Aviation Administration said the midair crash occurred before 9 p.m. EST when a regional jet that had departed from Wichita, Kansas, collided with a military helicopter on a training flight while on approach to an airport runway. It occurred in some of the most tightly controlled and monitored airspace in the world, just over three miles south of the White House and the Capitol. Investigators will try to piece together the aircrafts' final moments before their collision, including contact with air traffic controllers as well as a loss of altitude by the passenger jet. American Airlines Flight 5342 was inbound to Reagan National at an altitude of about 400 feet and a speed of about 140 miles per hour when it suffered a rapid loss of altitude over the Potomac River, according to data from its radio transponder. The Canadian-made Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet, manufactured in 2004, can be configured to carry up to 70 passengers. A few minutes before landing, air traffic controllers asked the arriving commercial jet if it could land on the shorter Runway 33 at Reagan National and the pilots said they were able. Controllers then cleared the plane to land on Runway 33. Flight tracking sites showed the plane adjust its approach to the new runway. Less than 30 seconds before the crash, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the arriving plane in sight. The controller made another radio call to the helicopter moments later: 'PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.' Seconds after that, the two aircraft collided. The plane’s radio transponder stopped transmitting about 2,400 feet short of the runway, roughly over the middle of the river. Video from an observation camera at the nearby Kennedy Center showed two sets of lights consistent with aircraft appearing to join in a fireball. 'I know that flight. I've flown it several times myself,' said Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas. He said he expected that many people in Wichita would know people who were on the flight. 'This is a very personal circumstance,' he said. The collision occurred on a warm winter evening in Washington, with temperatures registering as high as 60 degrees Fahrenheit, following a stretch days earlier of intense cold and ice. On Wednesday, the Potomac River was 36 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The National Weather Service reported that wind gusts of up to 25 mph were possible in the area throughout the evening. American Airlines CEO Robert Isom expressed 'deep sorrow' for the crash and said the company was focused on the needs of passengers, crew, first responders and families and loved ones of those involved. Some 300 first responders were on scene. Inflatable rescue boats were launched into the Potomac River from a point along the George Washington Parkway, just north of the airport, and first responders set up light towers from the shore to illuminate the area near the collision site. At least a half-dozen boats were scanning the water using searchlights. 'It’s a highly complex operation,' said D.C. fire chief John Donnelly. 'The conditions out there are extremely rough for the responders.' The U.S. Army described the helicopter as a UH-60 Blackhawk based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. The helicopter was on a training flight. Military aircraft frequently conduct training flights in and around the congested and heavily-restricted airspace around the nation’s capital for familiarization and continuity of government planning. The crash is serving as a major test for two of the Trump administration’s newest agency leaders. Pete Hegseth, sworn in days ago as defense secretary, posted on social media that an investigation has been 'launched immediately' by the Army and the Defense Department. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, just sworn in earlier this week, said at a somber news conference at the airport early Thursday that his agency would provide all possible resources to the investigation. The last fatal crash involving a U.S. commercial airline occured in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. Everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane was killed, including 45 passengers, 2 pilots and 2 flight attendants. Another person on the ground also died, bringing the total death toll to 50. An investigation determined that the captain accidentally caused the plane to stall as it approached the airport in Buffalo. Reagan Airport will reopen at 11 a.m. Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration announced. The FAA has previously said it would be closed until 5 a.m. Friday. Located along the Potomac River, just southwest of the city. Reagan National is a popular choice because it’s much closer than the larger Dulles International Airport, which is deeper in Virginia. Depending on the runway being used, flights into Reagan can offer passengers spectacular views of landmarks like the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the National Mall and the U.S. Capitol. It’s a postcard-worthy welcome for tourists visiting the city. The incident recalled the crash of an Air Florida flight that plummeted into the Potomac on January 13, 1982, that killed 78 people. That crash was attributed to bad weather.

IDF soldier Agam Berger freed after 482 days in Gaza captivity	Israeli civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80, are expected to be freed later in the day, in addition to five Thais. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israel Defense Forces soldier Agam Berger, 20, was freed by Hamas on Thursday as part of the terror group’s ceasefire agreement with Israel, 482 days after she was taken captive during the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. 'Agam Berger, accompanied by IDF and [Israel Security Agency] forces, recently crossed the border into the territory of the State of Israel,' the military stated.

Israeli officials previously told Hebrew media the hostages could be freed separately, possibly in multiple locations throughout the Strip. Arab media reported on Thursday morning that Palestinian terrorists were also seen preparing for the hostages’ handover to representatives of the Red Cross in the southern city of Khan Yunis, near the building where slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in October.

No weapons, malfunctioning bomb shelters: Sderot on Oct. 7th	Hamas terrorists, armed with automatic rifles, easily outgunned members of the city's emergency squad, who had only their personal handguns. By World Israel News Staff Initial findings from a probe of security failures in Sderot on October 7th paint a disturbing picture, as disorganization and logistical issues appear to have exacerbated the horrific events of that day. According to a summary of the report from Hebrew-language outlet Ynet, the city's emergency response squad was woefully underprepared and incapable of effectively battling a terrorist invasion. The report found that the emergency squad members were only armed with their personal handguns, while Hamas terrorists roaming the street had automatic rifles. Months before the invasion, the resignation of Sderot Police Chief Kobi Harush triggered a bureaucratic policy, which required the members of the city's emergency squad members to return their automatic weapons to the IDF's Gaza Division. Harush, who resigned because he was diagnosed with cancer, was designated by the army to be the ultimate authority responsible for the emergency squad's rifles. Army policy required the weapons to be turned over to the military, until a new police chief in the city could be held responsible for the arms once again. Sderot Mayor Alon Davidi was reportedly not informed about the return of the weapons. Prior to the terror onslaught, Ronen Gabbay, Sderot's then-recently appointed Chief of Police, had made a request to the military for the return of the automatic weapons. Lengthy bureaucratic delays meant on October 7th, Gabbay's request was still being processed by the army. Additionally, the IDF did not schedule and carry out consistent training sessions with Sderot's emergency squad, in violation of army and security policies. Sderot's municipal bomb shelters, which were controlled by a central electronic system, failed to open during air raid sirens on October 7th. Families of victims murdered on that day are suing Motorola, which produced the 'smart' shelters, and the city of Sderot. If the doors of the shelters had opened, victims could have been protected from Hamas gunmen and rocket fire, the plaintiffs say.

Behind the release of five Thai hostages	Foreign Minister Gideon Saar urged his Thai counterpart to press the Egyptian and Qatari mediators while final deal details were being discussed. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Five Thai hostages are to be freed Thursday along with three Israelis due to behind-the-scenes diplomatic work of Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. About two weeks before the agreement was signed between Israel and Hamas to exchange 33 Israeli hostages for a ceasefire, a withdrawal of IDF forces to the borders of Gaza, and hundreds of Palestinian terrorists, Saar called his Thai counterpart, Maris Sangiampongsa. He explained the parameters of the incipient deal and told the kingdom’s top diplomat that he believed Thailand could take advantage of it to free at least some Thai hostages as well, just as happened in the only other deal to date, in late November 2023. At that time, over a period of a week, 86 Israeli women and children out of 251 taken captive during the Hamas-led invasion and massacre seven weeks earlier were freed in return for a temporary ceasefire, increased humanitarian aid, and some 250 female and underage Palestinian prisoners. During the staged release, 23 of 31 Thai agricultural workers who had been kidnapped from the border kibbutzim in which they worked were freed in small groups as well, without Hamas demanding anything of Thailand in return. It was reported at the time that Thai officials negotiated for their release through the Iranians, who were not part of any negotiating channel being used by Israel. This time, Saar recommended that the Thais press the American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators who were working hard to get the deal across the finish line before President Trump took office. Saar similarly briefed Nepalese Foreign Minister Dr. Arzu Rana Deuba, as one citizen from her country is also still being held captive in Gaza. These efforts have seemingly been crowned with partial if not full success with the announcement earlier in the week by Hamas that it would free five of the eight remaining Thai hostages. Their first destination in Israel will be the Shamir Medical Center, where their compatriots had been taken care of after their release fourtenn months ago. 'We don't know what their situation is. It can be very complex, and we are prepared to provide the best medical care,' said hospital director Dr. Osnat Levtzion Korach. 'The fact that they have no families and are foreign citizens means that the hospital staff becomes a family for them upon their return to Israel, with a lot of warmth, love, pampering and a lot of attention,' she added. To aid in their psychological rehabilitation, the hospital will provide a Thai-speaking psychologist and interpreters with the assistance of the Thai embassy, with whom they are in constant contact, she said. Also based on their previous experience, the hospital has already prepared a small Buddhist temple for the separate complex where the hostages will recuperate in a homey atmosphere, much like their Israeli counterparts. After this release, there will still be five foreigners left in Hamas captivity, two of whom, a Thai agricultural worker and Nepalese agricultural student, are still believed to be alive. Two other Thais and a Tanzanian agricultural intern are known to be dead.

Who is Arbel Yehud, held hostage in Gaza for 15 months?	Yehud is thought to be the last surviving Israeli female civilian hostage in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Israeli hostage Arbel Yehud, who was kidnapped from the Gaza-adjacent Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th, 2023, is expected to be released later today (Thursday, January 30). She was 28 years old when she was abducted from her home, alongside her boyfriend, Ariel Cunio, who will remain in Gaza until the next phase of the hostage deal. Yehud's brother, Dolev, was initially believed to also have been kidnapped. In June 2024, some 8 months after the massacre, his remains were discovered in the kibbutz. Yehud was slated to be freed last Saturday, alongside three female soldiers, in line with the order of releases outlined in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement. However, less than 24 hours before the exchange was set to take place, the Hamas terror group informed Israel that it would release an additional female soldier, rather than Yehud. This change was significant due to the fact that it marked a clear violation of the ceasefire. At the time, Hamas claimed that the delay in Yehud's release was due to a dispute with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), the terror group that abducted her and has been holding her captive for more than 15 months. PIJ claimed that because Yehud allegedly underwent training as part of Israel's space program, she should be categorized as a soldier, not a civilian. This would force Israel to release a large number of terrorists from prison in order to secure her return. After Israel exerted pressure on Hamas by refusing to allow displaced Gazans to return to their homes in the north of the Strip until Yehud is scheduled for release, the terror group agreed to arrange her release five days later than originally anticipated. Yehud is thought to be the last surviving Israeli female civilian hostage in Gaza. One other civilian woman, Shiri Bibas, who was kidnapped with her toddler and infant sons, is still held captive. Israel has expressed 'grave concerns' regarding the fate of the Bibas family.

Will arch-terrorist Marwan Barghouti be freed in hostage deal?	Hamas appears confident that the mass murderer will be freed during the current ceasefire. By World Israel News Staff One of the most high-profile Palestinian terrorists of the First and Second Intifadas is expected to be released from an Israeli prison during the next phase of the hostage deal, Hamas officials say. Marwan Barghouti, who is serving multiple life sentences for planning deadly terror attacks that killed dozens of Israelis, is widely considered a folk hero among Palestinians. A wildly popular figure in both Gaza and Palestinian Authority-controlled enclaves in Judea and Samaria, polls have consistently found that Barghouti is the Palestinians' top choice for their leader. While Israel refused to release Barghouti in previous exchanges, including the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal, Hamas appears confident that the mass murderer will be freed during the current ceasefire. According to Hebrew-language media outlet KAN News, Hamas has told Barghouti's family to prepare for his release in the near future. 'It’s painful. It’s outrageous. Victims are outraged,' Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, president of the Shurat HaDin advocacy group for victims of terror, told The Media Line. 'How can it be that someone responsible for so many deaths could walk free? This is not just about Barghouti—it’s about justice for all victims.' Darshan-Leitner noted that 'Barghouti is not just any prisoner. His release would send a message that acts of terror can be forgiven, which is a dangerous precedent. The pain of the victims' families cannot simply be ignored in political negotiations.' Barghouti's son, Arab, told The Media Line that he was certain his father would be freed soon. 'We really trust that he will be released at the end of this because he belongs amongst the Palestinian people, and his influence is very positive for the Palestinian unity,' he said. If Barghouti is freed, he may be deported to Turkey, Qatar, or another state that has hosted exiled Palestinian terrorists.

3 Turks attempting to infiltrate from Lebanon killed by IDF	It's unclear if the Turkish nationals were affiliated with Hezbollah or another terror group. By World Israel News Staff Three Turkish nationals attempting to illegally cross from southern Lebanon into Israel were killed by an Israeli Air Force airstrike, according to a media statement from Turkey's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday. ''We wish Allah’s mercy upon our citizens and extend our condolences to their families,' the Ministry said, adding that Ankara is attempting to repatriate the bodies for burial in Turkey. 'We condemn in the strongest terms this unlawful attack that resulted in the death of our citizens,' the statement continued, without acknowledging the suspicious activity in which the slain men were engaged. 'As we have emphasized on every occasion, Israel must immediately end its aggressive policies that disregard human life and escalate tensions in our region,' the Ministry added. While the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not state the location or date of the strike, it appears that Ankara is referring to an incident that took place on January 11. On that day, the IDF released a statement acknowledging that it had killed three suspects who were trying to illegally infiltrate into Israeli territory from the Lebanese side of Mount Dov. The IDF statement did not provide details regarding the identity of the men. It's unclear if the Turkish nationals were affiliated with Hezbollah or another terror group. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is openly hostile towards the Jewish State, having repeatedly expressed support for Hamas and hosting the terror group's leadership. In November 2024, Erdoğan praised the ICC warrants issued against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Erdoğan has previously referred to Netanyahu as 'worse than Hitler' and a 'vampire that feeds on blood.' The Turkish leader has also claimed that Israel is a 'terrorist state' engaged in a 'genocide' against the Palestinian people.

Israel demands Hamas clarify condition of hostage mother Shiri Bi...	Although Shiri Bibas and her children were on the list of the 33 hostages slated for release in the initial stage, their absence from previous releases has been noted. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel has demanded information and clarity on the status of hostage mother Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir. The first phase of the hostage release deal was meant to prioritize women, children, the elderly, and the ill. Although Shiri Bibas and her children were on the list of the 33 hostages slated for release in the initial stage, their absence from previous releases has been noted. Hamas reported that 25 of the 33 hostages slated for release are alive and would return in the first part of the agreement, while the bodies of deceased captives would be handed over later. Last week, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari expressed 'grave concerns' over the fate of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir. The Israeli government is insisting on clarity regarding their status so that they can provide answers to the family. Relatives of the Bibas family expressed that their 'world came crashing down' when Shiri and her children were not on the list of hostages slated for release on Saturday. Yarden Bibas, Shiri Bibas’s husband and the father of the children, is scheduled to be released later in the first phase of the hostage deal. On Saturday night, relatives of the Bibas family released a statement criticizing the Israeli media for not addressing 'our pain, our struggle, and, most importantly, the urgent need to address the complexity and tragedy of their absence from the list.' The statement continued, 'Does the profound worry for their lives override the fact that they are innocent civilians in captivity who must be brought home?' they asked. 'Does the deep concern for Shiri’s life erase the need to show her photo as a kidnapped civilian in Gaza, whose fate remains uncertain?' 'The answer is—no.' The statement went on to express happiness over the release of four female soldiers-Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, and Liri Albag-on Saturday night, while resolving to continue fighting for the return of the Bibas family. 'Liri, Daniela, Naama, and Karina — We are waiting to see you smile, surrounded by love, back home with your amazing families. Shiri, Yarden, Ariel, and Kfir — We will keep hoping and fighting for your return. It’s not over until it’s over,' the relatives’ statement concluded.

Combative Jewish lawmaker Randy Fine, a Trump favorite, wins Flor...	Soon after announcing his candidacy, he tweeted '#BombsAway' at pro-Palestinian Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, which Muslim-rights groups and the Anti-Defamation League condemned as a threat. By Andrew Lapin, JTA Randy Fine, a Jewish Florida state senator whose bruising demeanor has made him a new favorite on the right, easily won the Republican primary for an open House seat. An Associated Press estimate showed that Fine took more than 80% of the GOP vote on Tuesday. The district is deep red, making his victory in the April 1 special election all but assured. He would replace Michael Waltz, who left Congress to become Trump’s national security advisor. Fine decided to run in the district, even though he does not currently live there, after receiving an enthusiastic endorsement from President Donald Trump. He did not immediately return a Jewish Telegraphic Agency request for comment on his victory. But on social media, he made clear the spiritual reason why he ran. The northeast Florida district has few Jews but many conservative Christians. 'G-d saved @realDonaldTrump’s life so he could save the world,' the state senator wrote on X. 'And tonight, both of them, powered by my amazing family and all of you who voted for me, put me one step closer to being able to help him do that. I swear I won’t let any of you down.' Fine has used his Jewish and ardent pro-Israel background to court controversy. Soon after announcing his candidacy, he tweeted '#BombsAway' at pro-Palestinian Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, which Muslim-rights groups and the Anti-Defamation League condemned as a threat. (Fine denied he meant the remark as a threat.) In his home state he has called progressive Jewish critics 'Judenrat,' a term denoting Jewish councils who helped the Nazis. He has also clashed with the LGBTQ community and with local judges, and was formerly a close ally of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis until Fine became frustrated with DeSantis’s handling of antisemitism and Israel issues. Many Jews have embraced him, and he received endorsements from the Republican Jewish Coalition and the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC, whom he thanked on X after his victory with the message 'Supporting Israel IS America first.' Fine also has a legislative track record of fighting antisemitism, having passed laws in his home state to help law enforcement prosecute white nationalists. He recently prompted a textbook review for antisemitism and anti-Israel bias across Florida’s public university system.

‘It’s devastating to see your home like this’: Returning to ruins...	In Metula, Israel’s northernmost city, hardly any house has been spared from either a direct hit or shrapnel. In the homes that somehow avoided being hit, an atmosphere of neglect and despair pervades. By Anna Epshtein, TPS 'Oh my! There is a rat here!' Lili screams as she opens a drawer in the kitchen. The smell of the dead animal hangs in the air. Curious teenage volunteers who were emptying drawers in an adjoining room approach to look, then scrunch their faces in disgust. Unshaken, Lili takes a serving spoon and uses it to lift the rat into the garbage bag, together with the rest of the drawer’s contents — papers, small plastic containers and scattered toothpicks. Lili Medalsi is a volunteer coordinator at the organization called 'Habaita,' and her job for the near future is helping northern Israelis make their abandoned homes livable — or helping them say goodbye like she did for her own house. 'When my partner and I first came here after the ceasefire, we froze in place and could not move. We stood like this for three hours and then left. Could not do a thing,' Shahaf Daniel, who used to rent the upper floor of this house in Metula, told The Press Service of Israel. 'It’s devastating to see you home like this.' Rat excrement is scattered all over. In a bedroom on the first floor, a hole in a wall – the result of rocket shrapnel – creates an expressive frame through which to view a neighbor’s half-destroyed house. After the war with Hamas broke out on October 7, 2023, more than 70,000 residents of the Israeli north were evacuated from their homes as Hezbollah began launching daily barrages of rockets and drones. In Metula, Israel’s northernmost city, hardly any house has been spared from either a direct hit or shrapnel. In the homes that somehow avoided being hit, an atmosphere of neglect and despair pervades. Since a ceasefire with Hezbollah took effect on November 27, hundreds of volunteers from all over Israel have been coming to the north to help the residents restore not just their homes, but also hope that life can get back to normal. Inside the ‘War Room’ In a small room above the dining hall in Kibbutz Amir, some 10 km from the Lebanese border, a dozen teenagers are juggling Excel spreadsheets on their computers, with a background buzz of phone conversations. A bald, bearded man moves among them, one hand holding a cell phone to his ear, the other hand intensely gesturing. The man is Nathanel Barak, the head of the Upper Galilee Pre-Military Academy, which has more than 200 students. Bringing his military attitude to the civilian task of organizing the volunteers’ work, he partnered with two organizations involved in helping Israeli civilians since October 7 – Lev Ehad and Habaita – to open what everyone here refers to as 'the war room,' where coordinators connect returning homeowners with volunteers. 'When a family enters their home after more than a year, it is often a shock. Rats have eaten the pipes, there is this smell… They don’t just need extra hands for cleaning – they need emotional support, and that’s what volunteers bring,' Barak told TPS-IL. 'What really helps people is this feeling that they don’t deal with this alone, that good people from all over the country come to help them.' Most of the volunteers here are Barak’s students, but many more have come to help from all walks of Israeli society: families with kids, youth and pensioners. Some come to the north for a day, others stay for a week or even more. At nearby Kibbutz Malkiya, once a popular tourist destination right on the border with Lebanon, orange-jacketed workers from Tel Aviv patching up a pock-marked road are the only people around. Seats at a nearby bus stop are covered with a thick layer of faded leaves. Inside a gloomy concrete building that used to house a different pre-military academy, a group of people who could hardly be brought together under any other circumstances are gathering for dinner of couscous and vegetables – several youths from Haifa, a pensioner from Modiin, and an American pastor from Seattle — after a busy day of cleaning homes. 'We helped two nice old ladies in Kiryat Shmona today in their gardens,' Mika Mazor, a twentysomething from Haifa said. 'They were so glad we came. They put on some music, and we chatted, and it felt like we really made some difference there.' One of Mika’s friends interjects, 'It’s so weird that we are here, right?’ We all have lives… But it feels so good to be here now.' Not Staying Medalsi, who helped clean Daniel’s house, told TPS-IL that she also has a house in Metula, but doesn’t intend to continue to living in the city. 'The community is dispersed throughout the whole country. Before businesses here will come back to life -– and I pray they will -– much time will pass,' Medalsi explained. 'Metula is going to be in building scaffolding for a long time. I found myself in another part of the country during the war. But it is a personal victory for me that I am back to the north now, helping people.' She recalled being in her kitchen preparing to bake herself a birthday cake on October 9 when she needed to evacuate. When she returned to her house for the first time after the ceasefire was declared, the ingredients were still sitting on the counter. The dozens of houseplants she cared for were all dead. 'I finally locked my house a week ago after I painted it and fixed the holes. I pressed myself to the wall and said good bye,' she said. 'I’m not coming back.' Meanwhile, Shahaf Daniel and her partner pack all the belongings they want to take with them and take a walk around the empty house. They don’t plan to stay in Metula either. 'I need my country to do something for me to come back here. It’s impossible that Lebanese villages stay like these, so close to us. I do not want to be afraid that they watch me, or that a rocket hits me,' said Shachaf. 'They need to be moved further from the border, and the IDF needs to be here. Then I can start to consider getting back.'

Targeted mRNA therapy holds promise for Crohn’s disease, colitis,...	The findings suggest that lipid composition can direct mRNA-based drugs to target organs, such as the intestines, without passing through the liver. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli researchers unveiled on Wednesday a new method of delivering drugs that could lead to more effective treatments for gastrointestinal conditions such as Crohn’s disease and colitis, and opens a door to targeted therapies for other conditions. Typically, when drugs are injected into the bloodstream, they pass through the liver, where they can either be processed or broken down. This process can limit the effectiveness of medications designed to target specific organs or cells, especially if the liver metabolizes the drugs before they can reach their intended destination. In the case of mRNA-based drugs — which use messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct cells to produce specific proteins that can treat or prevent disease — the liver is the primary site of drug breakdown. However, Tel Aviv University researchers led by Dr. Riccardo Rampado and Prof. Dan Peer demonstrated that it is possible to bypass the liver and control where in the body mRNA-based drugs are delivered by altering the composition of lipid nanoparticles that encapsulate the mRNA. The study was recently published in the peer-reviewed Advanced Science journal. The findings suggest that lipid composition can direct mRNA-based drugs to target organs, such as the intestines, without passing through the liver. The team’s proof-of-concept study focused on delivering mRNA encoding interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory protein, to the intestines of animal models suffering from Crohn’s disease and colitis. The mRNA was encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles with a higher phospholipid content than those used in typical mRNA vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccine. The researchers found that increasing the phospholipid ratio to 30% enabled the particles to navigate through the bloodstream directly to the intestines. This approach not only targeted the inflamed tissues but also encouraged immune cells in the intestine to produce the therapeutic protein, significantly improving symptoms of both conditions. By adjusting the lipid composition, the researchers could potentially deliver mRNA-based drugs to other organs, including the pancreas, further expanding the range of treatable diseases. 'It’s all in the formulation,' Peer said. For example, medicine might enable the targeting of immune cells in the pancreas to treat conditions like type 1 diabetes or even autoimmune disorders affecting the pancreas. Similarly, the approach could potentially be adapted to target other organs, such as the brain, liver, or lungs, allowing for more tailored and effective therapies. Moreover, many side effects occur as a result of drugs passing through multiple organs. Direct delivery would minimize those side effects.

IDF downs drone carrying 13 rifles, ammo near Egypt border	On Nov. 27, the IDF shot down another drone carrying weapons and ammo and crossed from Egyptian territory into the western Negev. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces on Wednesday downed an unmanned aerial vehicle carrying 13 rifles with ammunition that had crossed into Israeli territory from Egypt, according to the military. Soldiers of the IDF’s Paran Brigade shot down the drone, which was then handed over to security forces for inspection, the IDF stated. כוחות צה״ל זיהו במהלך הלילה, רחפן שחצה משטח מצרים לשטח מדינת ישראל במרחב חטיבת פארן. הרחפן הופל על-ידי הכוח שהגיע לנקודה ואותרו על הרחפן 13 כלי נשק ומחסניות נוספות. אמצעי הלחימה שהוחרמו הועברו לטיפול כוחות הביטחון pic.twitter.com/ywFBbA6XA9 &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) January 29, 2025 On Nov. 27, the IDF shot down another drone carrying weapons and ammo and crossed from Egyptian territory into the western Negev. The UAV 'was shot down by the forces of the Caracal Battalion, who arrived at the scene and discovered four rifles, five cartridges and hundreds of bullets on the drone,' the military stated at the time. On Oct. 30, four rifles and a handgun were found after Paran Brigade soldiers downed yet another drone that had crossed the border from Egypt. The previous week, eight handguns, along with magazines, were discovered at a UAV crash site.

Three Israeli hostages, five Thais slated for release Thursday	Some of the families of hostages scheduled to be released have been informed that there are fears for their loved ones’ lives after Hamas provided Israel with information on the captives on Monday. By JNS Israel received from Hamas a list of three Israeli hostages and five Thai captives expected to be released tomorrow, Israel’s public broadcaster Kan News reported on Wednesday. According to reports, they are expected to be Arbel Yehud, a civilian, Agam Berger, an IDF lookout, and Gadi Moses, an 80-year-old. On Saturday, Hamas failed to provide a list detailing the status of the hostages slated to be released in the initial stage, as required by the terms of the deal, prompting Jerusalem to postpone the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza. However, they were allowed to return on Monday morning. Hamas further violated the agreement by not freeing female civilians first. Instead of releasing Yehud, the Palestinian terror group released four female soldiers on Saturday: Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19. Yehud was taken hostage with her boyfriend, Ariel Cunio, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023. Cunio, 27, is presumed to be alive but is not listed among those to be released in the first phase of the agreement. Shiri Bibas, 33, another female civilian hostage, and her two young sons are on the list of hostages to be released during the first phase. However, Hamas claimed in November that they had been killed. Some of the families of hostages scheduled to be released have been informed that there are fears for their loved ones’ lives, after Hamas provided Israel with information on the captives on Monday. The list did not specify the status of individuals, and instead only included an overall number of captives who are claimed to be alive. While Israeli officials are unable to provide relatives with definitive news regarding the possible deaths of their loved ones, the numbers were said to match the intelligence Jerusalem already possessed. Three civilian women—Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher—were released on Jan. 19 in return for 90 terrorists (30 for each civilian) shortly after the ceasefire went into effect.

Israel arrests 12 Arabs for celebrating release of terrorists in ...	The eastern Jerusalem and Aqab village residents had waved Hamas flags and shot in the air to show support for one of the terrorists freed Saturday. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Twelve Arabs were arrested Tuesday night by Israeli authorities after they were involved in a demonstration showing support for a terrorist who was released as part of the exchange for four hostages Saturday. The police and Shabak tracked them down using video footage that was circulated online of the event and conducting several intelligence operations. On the clip, the mix of residents of eastern Jerusalem and the village of Aqab on the northern edge of the capital could be seen celebrating the freedom of Zayeed Ashraf by waving Hamas flags, chanting in support for the Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, and expressing joy by shooting into the air in the village. When the police, Shabak, Border Police undercover unit and IDF forces raided their homes, they found Hamas flags, posters, fireworks, a large sum of money, and other incriminatory items. One of those arrested was Ashraf’s brother, who played a central role in the celebratory demonstration. The forces also seized the vehicles the suspects used in their party. In 2002, Ashraf sent a suicide bomber to blow himself up on a bus on Allenby Street in Tel Aviv, killing six people, and he was sentenced to six life terms as a result. Immediately upon his release, he gave an interview to the Qatari TV channel Al-Araby to claim that Israel 'starves' its prisoners 'on a daily basis,' although he did not look particularly thin in the video clips showing him being carried on the shoulders of his fellow villagers. Nine other suspects from Kafr Aqab and the village of Kafr A-Ram near Ramallah were also arrested for similarly expressing solidarity with released terrorists. 'The Israel Police and the Shabak will not allow any displays of joy or expressions of identification with and support for the Hamas terrorist organization and terrorists,' the authorities said in a statement. 'The security forces will use all means at their disposal to maintain security and order.' Defense Minister Yisrael Katz had ordered that a joint force be established specifically to prevent such demonstrations, considering them incitement and encouragement of terrorism. The twelve were taken to the Jerusalem District Police's Serious Crimes Unit for further questioning. They will be brought Wednesday to court for the police to ask to extend their detention in custody.

IDF forces to remain in Jenin after operation completed	Israel 'declares war on Palestinian terror in Judea and Samaria,' as defense minister says IDF forces will stay in Jenin even after the current counter-terror operation is completed. By World Israel News Staff Israel's latest counter-terror operation in northern Samaria constitutes a 'declaration of war' on Palestinian terrorism, the Israeli defense chief Israel Katz announced Wednesday, vowing to keep IDF forces in the Palestinian Authority-administered city of Jenin even after the operation is completed. Earlier this month, Israeli forces launched Operation Iron Wall against the Jenin Brigades, an umbrella group of terrorist organizations in the city of Jenin in northern Samaria. The operation was launched after the Palestinian Authority's paramilitary security force failed to wrest control of the city from rival groups during clashes in December and January. On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) visited IDF forces operating in Jenin, accompanied by Central Command Chief Major General Avi Blot, Judea and Samaria Division Commander Brigadier General Yaki Dolf, Menashe Brigade Commander Colonel A., and other senior officers. During his visit, Katz held a situational assessment on-site and stated that Operation Iron Wall would expand to additional terror camps beyond Jenin. He emphasized the need to act with full force to implement the policy of eliminating terrorists and dismantling terrorist infrastructure in the camp, ensuring that terrorism does not return after the operation concludes. Katz was briefed by IDF officers about the massive weapons seizures in the Jenin refugee camp, which some officers described as being 'just like in Gaza.' The Defense Minister said that Israel has 'declared war on Palestinian terrorism in Judea and Samaria,' and that Operation Iron Wall will 'dismantle the terror infrastructure built in Palestinian refugee camps, funded and armed by Iran.' 'The IDF is operating with full force in the Jenin refugee camp to eliminate terrorists and destroy terror infrastructure, as we have seen here today.' Katz added that IDF forces will remain in Jenin even after the current operation is completed, hinting at a long-term deployment, and a possible alteration to the status quo in the PA-administered city. 'The Jenin refugee camp will not return to what it was. After the operation is completed, IDF forces will remain in the camp to ensure that terrorism does not return.' 'I am sending a clear message to the Palestinian Authority: Stop funding terrorism and the murder of Jews, and start seriously fighting terror. Those who finance the families of terrorist murderers and educate their children to seek Israel’s destruction endanger their own existence.'

Hidden for millennia: Roman-era papyrus details tax evasion and s...	Dr. Avner Eckner, of Hebrew University, suggested that the two defendants were either engaged in evading Roman taxes or possibly fulfilling a Biblical duty to redeem enslaved Jews. By Pesach Benson, TPS A newly analyzed papyrus has unveiled a spectacular case of forgery and fiscal fraud in the Roman Empire, providing scholars with rare insight into the legal and administrative workings of the imperial state. Discovered among the collections of the Israel Antiquities Authority and recently published in the international scholarly journal Tyche, the document details a financial crime involving tax fraud and the illegal sale and manumission of slaves in the Roman provinces of Judea and Arabia. The case, which took place against the backdrop of political unrest in the region, offers a direct look at Roman jurisdiction, legal practice, and the turbulent relationship between the empire and its subjects. The Greek-language papyrus, the longest ever found in the Judean Desert with over 133 lines of text, had remained unnoticed for decades after being misclassified as Nabataean. Its significance came to light in 2014 when Professor Hannah Cotton-Paltiel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem rediscovered it while organizing documentary papyri at the Israel Antiquities Authority’s scrolls laboratory. Upon realizing the misclassification, Cotton-Paltiel exclaimed, 'It’s Greek to me!' In recognition of her role in its rediscovery, the document has been named P. Cotton in line with papyrological conventions. Understanding the importance of the document, she assembled a team of scholars from the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the University of Vienna, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to decipher the text. They determined that the papyrus contained notes from prosecutors preparing for a trial before Roman officials on the eve of the Bar Kochba revolt (132–136 CE). The text includes a draft transcript of the judicial hearing itself, making it a rare and valuable source for understanding Roman legal procedures. The language is strikingly direct, capturing exchanges between prosecutors as they strategized and assessed evidence. 'This papyrus is extraordinary because it provides direct insight into trial preparations in this part of the Roman Empire,' said Dr. Anna Dolganov of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The case revolves around two defendants, Gadalias and Saulos, who were accused of tax evasion and document forgery. Gadalias, the son of a notary and possibly a Roman citizen, had a history of criminal activities, including counterfeiting, extortion, and inciting rebellion. Saulos, his accomplice, orchestrated fraudulent transactions with forged documents involving the selling and freeing of slaves. 'Freeing slaves does not appear to be a profitable business model,' said Dr. Avner Eckner of Hebrew University, suggesting that the two were either engaged in evading Roman taxes or possibly fulfilling a Biblical duty to redeem enslaved Jews. Said Dolganov, 'Forgery and tax fraud carried severe penalties under Roman law, including hard labor or even capital punishment.' The historical context surrounding the case adds another layer of intrigue. The trial took place between two significant Jewish revolts against Roman rule: the Jewish Diaspora revolt (115–117 CE) and the Bar Kochba revolt (132–136 CE). The text suggests that Gadalias and Saulos may have been involved in rebellious activities during Emperor Hadrian’s visit to the region in 129–130 CE. Their case also names Tineius Rufus, the governor of Judea at the time the Bar Kochba revolt erupted, suggesting that Roman authorities were deeply concerned about the implications of their actions. 'Whether they were indeed involved in rebellion remains an open question, but the insinuation speaks to the charged atmosphere of the time,' explained Dolganov. Beyond its historical and political implications, the papyrus sheds new light on Roman law in the Greek-speaking eastern empire. It references the governor’s assize tour of his province to hear legal cases and administer justice. The reference to compulsory jury service confirms that legal institutions known from Egypt were also in effect in other provinces. 'This document shows that core Roman institutions documented in Egypt were also implemented throughout the empire,' noted Prof. Fritz Mitthof of the University of Vienna. Additionally, the papyrus highlights the Roman state’s ability to regulate private transactions even in the empire’s distant regions. The outcome of the trial may have been disrupted by the rebellion, leaving unanswered questions about the fate of the accused, the researchers said. The document was likely hidden in a cave in the Judaean Desert during the Bar Kochba revolt.

Senate Dems block bill to impose sanctions on International Crimi...	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote on Tuesday that he supports imposing sanctions on the court in response to its investigation of Israel but that the bill’s provisions were overly broad. By Andrew Bernard, JNS Democrats in the U.S. Senate blocked a bill on Tuesday that would impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court over its decision to investigate and issue warrants for the arrest of Israeli officials, including the Israeli prime minister. Republicans needed 60 votes to invoke cloture and proceed, but the vote failed 54-45, with Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) the lone Democrat to vote 'yea.' The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Illegitimate Court Counteraction (ICC) Act earlier this month 243-140, with 45 Democrats voting in favor. The bill instructs the U.S. president to impose sanctions within 60 days on anyone who 'has directly engaged in or otherwise aided any effort by the International Criminal Court to investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute' U.S. citizens or the citizens of U.S. allies not party to the ICC’s Rome Statute, including Israel. In November, the ICC, a stand-alone court in The Hague which is not part of the United Nations, issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, the former defense minister, for alleged 'crimes against humanity and war crimes' in Gaza. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote on Tuesday that he supports imposing sanctions on the court in response to its investigation of Israel but that the bill’s provisions were overly broad. 'The ICC bill is one I largely support and would like to see become law,' Schumer said. 'However, as much as I oppose the ICC’s deep bias against Israel, and as much as I want to see that institution drastically reformed and reshaped, the bill before us is poorly drafted and deeply problematic.' In the floor debate on the bill, Republicans and Democrats disagreed on how wide a net ought to be cast in applying sanctions to ICC employees and contractors. 'Others have said the ICC bill targets ‘citizens of our allies,’' Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said. 'Yes, if you are involved in illegitimately targeting Americans, you could face sanctions.' 'This bill does not, once again, sanction foreign nations like the United Kingdom, but if British nationals at the court are targeting American citizens, you better believe they could face sanctions,' Cotton added. Fetterman wrote that he was 'deeply disappointed' about the outcome of the vote. 'My vote follows Israel—not the ICC that equivocated the democratically elected leader of our special ally to the terrorists and rapists of Hamas,' Fetterman said.

Trump’s intelligence director nominee denies meeting Hezbollah of...	Tulsi Gabbard said she did talk in 2017 with the head of Lebanese intelligence, who was close to the terror group. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News In the runup to her Senate confirmation hearing Thursday, Tulsi Gabbard, U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee for Director of Intelligence, denied meeting with a senior Hezbollah official during a trip to Syria in 2017. A New York Times report Wednesday revealed that during her visit, which she made in her position as a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, she met with then-dictator Bashar al-Assad, who was overthrown last month by Islamist rebels. Citing 'current and former officials briefed on the intelligence,' the report said that soon afterwards, the Americans intercepted a phone call in which one Hezbollah member told another that Gabbard had met with someone he called in Arabic 'the boss,' or 'the big guy.' Some intelligence personnel thought this was a reference to a high-ranking member of the Iranian terror proxy, while others thought the person may instead have been a Lebanese government official with close ties to Hezbollah, said the report. Gabbard repudiated the idea that she had met directly with a member of the terror organization, but conceded that she had met with several Lebanese officials during her trip. This included the country’s then-intelligence chief, who was considered close to the group that had been a powerful and long-time agent of Iran within the Lebanese government. Hezbollah’s influence has since been considerably diminished after the IDF decimated its leadership and destroyed most of its armaments and offensive military capabilities late last year, and weakened its patron in airstrikes that took out most of Iran’s air defenses after Tehran launched hundreds of missiles at Israel, which were almost all intercepted and did little harm. Gabbard confidantes noted that she had disclosed the identities of all the people she met with on her trip 'and they said the intelligence in question was misinterpreted,' the report said. Although she is essentially an isolationist like Trump with little interest in getting involved in 'counterproductive wars of regime change,' she has also described herself as a hawk 'when it comes to the war against terrorists,' calling Islamic extremists 'the real enemy' of the U.S. Although not always so, she has recently been a firm supporter of Israel, immediately labeling Hamas an Islamist terrorist organization that 'needs to be defeated militarily and ideologically' after the group led a surprise invasion of the Jewish state in October 2023, slaughtering 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages into captivity. She was opposed to a UN ceasefire resolution last year, saying, 'We have to be realists about the threat that continues to exist for the people of Israel. So as long as Hamas is in power, the people of Israel will not be secure and cannot live in peace.' As director of national intelligence, Gabbard would be the head of the entire U.S. intelligence community, acting as the principal adviser to the president, the National Security Council, and the Homeland Security Council for intelligence matters related to national security. In terms of relevant experience for the position, she has no intelligence background but is a Lieutenant Colonel in the army reserves with top-secret security clearance who served in places such as Iraq and Kuwait. The 43-year-old turned Republican and became an enthusiastic Trump supporter two years ago.

Congressional Republicans push to replace ‘West Bank’ with ‘Judea...	Republican lawmakers relaunch bid, supported by President Donald Trump, to end use of the phrase 'West Bank' in all official federal documents in favor of the area's historical name, Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff A Republican congresswoman is rebooting legislative efforts to replace the term 'West Bank' with 'Judea and Samaria' in all official federal documents. New York Rep. Claudia Tenney announced last week at a meeting of the Congressional Israel Allies Caucus that she plans on reintroducing a bill which would replace the term 'West Bank' with the historical name for the territories occupied by Jordan west of the Jordan River from 1948-1967. 'We need to make sure that we don’t allow the language, the tradition, the history of Israel, to be weaponized by terms like ‘West Bank,’' Tenney said, noting that President Donald Trump has expressed support for the move. 'President Trump has said this is going to be a very priority task for him to get this done,' Tenney said. 'It’s the beginning of us shifting the language, and what we’re doing and making sure that we always protect the historical homeland of the Jews, and that is in Israel, and Israel includes Judea and Samaria.' Last February, Tenney introduced a bill, cosponsored by fellow Republican lawmakers Anthony D’Esposito and Randy Weber, which, if passed would 'require all official United States documents and materials to use the term 'Judea and Samaria' instead of the 'West Bank'.' 'The term Judea and Samaria dates back millennia to the ancient Kingdoms of Judah and Samaria,' Tenney said after the drafting of the 2024 bill. 'In 1967, after Israel’s Arab neighbors launched the Six-Day War, Israel reclaimed Judea and Samaria from Jordan. The term 'West Bank' is used to delegitimize Israel’s historical claim to this land.' In December, Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas introduced parallel legislation to the Senate. According to a report by Yedioth Aharanoth, Cotton is also planning to reintroduce his bill this year.

US halts funding for Gaza condoms	Trump White House slams $50 million program funding Gaza condoms as a 'preposterous waste of taxpayer money,' while past attacks suggest Hamas may have used condoms for makeshift balloon bombs. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration has halted American funding for a program supplying the Gaza Strip with condoms, the new White House press secretary said Tuesday. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt castigated the program during her press briefing representing the Trump administration, telling reporters Tuesday that funding Gaza condoms was a 'preposterous waste' of American tax dollars. 'That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money. So that's what this pause is focused on, being good stewards of tax dollars,' Leavitt said. According to the White House press secretary, the new Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Elon Musk, and the Office of Budget Management had found 'that there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.' The two offices also reported that the U.S. was poised to transfer $37 million to the World Health Organization, before Trump cut America's ties with the organization. The $50 million Gaza condom program was cut after Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a directive over the weekend halting nearly all foreign aid programs, pending a systematic internal review of every program receiving American funds. Rubio's internal memo came in response to an executive order issued by President Donald Trump last week on the first day of his second term, ordering federal authorities to pause foreign aid while scrutinizing U.S. funding for programs abroad. Military aid to Egypt and Israel were both granted waivers from the order, as were emergency food programs. A White House official told Fox News that under Trump's executive order, programs contradicting the White House's 'priorities' will see their funding terminated, citing both the Gaza condom program and U.S. funding for the WHO. 'If the activity is not in conflict with the President’s priorities, it will continue with no issues,' the White House official said. 'This is similar to how HHS stopped the flow of grant money to the WHO after President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the organization. Or how the State Department halted several million dollars going to condoms in Gaza this past weekend.' Aside from concerns over the misuse of American taxpayer funds, the Gaza condom program has raised fears that the aid could indirectly support terrorism by organizations like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which have in the past used condoms for makeshift balloon-based incendiary bombs to spark fires in Israeli territory.

Israeli contractor mistakenly shot dead by IDF in Gaza	We can't fathom that we're speaking about him in the past tense,' says friend of man killed in friendly-fire incident. By World Israel News Staff A civilian contractor working for as an engineer for the Defense Ministry was mistakenly shot and killed by IDF forces in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, the military said in a media statement. Hebrew-language media identified the slain man as Kobi Avitan, a 39-year-old father of three and Eilat resident. According to reports, Avitan was operating an excavator to clear damaged structures in the Netzarim Corridor area of central Gaza. Throughout the war, the Defense Ministry has hired civilian contractors for engineering and other activities within the Strip. This practices eases the burden on IDF troops and allows the military to leverage them for combat missions, rather than other tasks. An initial IDF investigation found that a soldier guarding a post near Netzarim opened fire on Avitan after falsely identifying him as a terrorist. 'Kobi was a man with a huge heart. We can't fathom that we're speaking about him in the past tense. Whatever we needed, he was the first to come and help, always volunteering,' Nati Twito a friend of Avitan, told Walla. 'He volunteered in many places, in anything he could help with, he was there. This is a massive tragedy. Everyone is shocked and in disbelief, unable to comprehend that Kobi is no longer with us,' Twito added. The slaying of Avitan marked the first time since the beginning of the ceasefire that an Israeli was killed in the coastal enclave. The last fatalities before the ceasefire occurred in Beit Hanoun on January 13th, when Hamas terrorists fired an anti-tank missile at a building, killing five soldiers from the Nahal Brigade. In May 2024, another civilian contractor, identified as Liron Yitzhak, 30, was killed during an attack by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip. 840 Israeli soldiers and police officers have been killed since the war began on October 7th, 2023.

Israeli tourists required to disclose IDF service before entering...	Visa application to New Zealand asks Israelis if they have 'committed or been involved in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or human rights abuses.' By World Israel News Staff New Zealand recently denied a tourist visa to an Israeli citizen who served in Gaza, signaling that the country is adopting a policy similar to that of neighboring Australia. According to a Zman Israel report, New Zealand now requires Israelis to disclose extensive details about their military service when applying for a visa. The country requires Israelis to detail sensitive information about their military service, including their army identification numbers, their roles and details of their duties, locations of the bases where they served, the name of their unit or corps, and more. Israelis who served in classified roles are forbidden from providing many these details, making it impossible for them to apply for a visa at this time, Zman Israel reported. An additional questionnaire asks applicants if they have 'committed or been involved in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or human rights abuses.' The application also asks if Israelis are associated with 'a group or organization that has used or promoted violence or human rights abuses to further their aims.' One Israeli, speaking anonymously to Zman Israel, said that he had been denied a visa after revealing he had performed military service in Gaza, despite answering no to the questions about being complicit in human rights violations and war crimes. Notably, INZ, New Zealand’s immigration authority, did not dispute that they had denied a visa to an Israeli solely because he had served in the Gaza Strip. 'INZ understands the difficult situation this crisis is causing for many and has great sympathy for those separated from their loved ones during this stressful time,' the INZ told Zman Israel. 'A visitor visa can be declined for a number of reasons, and it is difficult for us to comment on why a person’s application was declined without the details of their application. Immigration instructions do not prevent individuals who have served in this conflict from applying for or being granted a visitor visa.'

Emiratis to acquire 30% stake in Israeli security company	Israel’s Ministry of Defense must grant permission for the deal to move forward. By World Israel News Staff A major military technology firm in the United Arab Emirates is gearing up to purchase a large stake in an Israeli security company, illustrating the growing defense-focused ties between the UAE and the Jewish State. The EDGE Group, an Emirati technology and defense conglomerate, is expected to pay more than $10 million for 30 percent of Israeli company Third Eye Systems, which manufactures smart cameras for detecting UAVs and drones. The outline for the deal would see EDGE Group purchase the shares, then the two companies establish a joint venture, according to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Walla. In that new company, which will focus on electrical optical identification systems, EDGE Group will invest an additional $12 million and will hold a controlling 51 percent stake in the company. 43 percent of the new venture will be held by Third Eye Systems, with an undisclosed body holding the remaining 6 percent. However, due to the sensitive nature of the military technology included in the agreement, Israel’s Ministry of Defense must grant permission for the deal to move forward. Third Eye Systems is chaired by retired Major General Didi Yaari, former commander of the Israeli Navy and the ex-CEO of Rafael, Israel’s most prominent defense manufacturing company. Its clients include the Ministry of Defense, Israel Aerospace Industries, and Elbit Systems. Currently, Third Eye Systems is traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange at a valuation of 84 million shekels ($23 million), with its stock surging 23 percent following the announcement of the potential deal with EDGE Group, Walla reported. One of the world’s top manufacturers and suppliers of precision guided munitions, the EDGE Group has made a number of high-profile investments in other defense companies in recent years. In 2021, the EDGE Group signed an agreement with Israel Aerospace Industries to manufacture autonomous vessels for military and commercial use.

Freed hostage Naama Levy: ‘I saw how you were fighting for me’	I’m safe and protected, surrounded by family and friends, and feeling better with each passing day.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Freed hostage Naama Levy posted on social media Tuesday for the first time since her release, thanking her family, the IDF, and Israel. 'I want to thank the IDF soldiers and all the people of Israel. Even in captivity, I saw how you were fighting for me! Thank you, everyone; I love you,' she posted. 'I’m home. After 477 days, I’m finally home,' she wrote. 'I’m safe and protected, surrounded by family and friends, and feeling better with each passing day.' 'During the first 50 days since October 7, I was alone most of the time,' Naama Levy wrote, alluding to reports that she had been kept in tunnels for the first months of her captivity with little or no social contact. When she was able to connect with other female IDF lookouts and civilians held with her, Naama Levy said they gave her 'strength and hope.' She said they 'supported one another until the day of our release and continue to do so afterward.' On Saturday, four female hostages were released: Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, and Liri Albag. All four were IDF lookouts who were taken captive at their post in Nahal Oz on October 7, 2023. A fifth lookout, Agam Berger, who was captured with them, is expected to be released on Thursday. Naama Levy expressed her hope that Agam would return soon, and wrote, 'We are waiting for Agam and the rest of the hostages to return so that we can complete the recovery process.' Liri Albag, who was freed along with Naama Levy on Saturday, told her family that Gazan civilians were complicit in Hamas's crimes. 'Liri told me, ‘Dad, there are two million terrorists, make no mistake. I sat with an eight-year-old boy, and with four-year-old children who would say 'We spit on the Jews,' do you understand what that means?’ Eli Albag, Liri's father, told 103FM on Monday. He didn't answer questions about how Liri was treated in captivity, given that there are still hostages in danger in Gaza, but said, 'Let’s just say they aren’t our friends. They are our enemy who want to kill us.'

Defense Minister Katz says Israel will remain on Mount Hermon ‘in...	This is the most far-reaching statement Katz has made so far regarding the length of time Israeli troops would be stationed in the Syrian buffer zone. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz declared on Tuesday that Israel will keep troops at the Mount Hermon post in Syria 'indefinitely.' This is the most far-reaching statement Katz has made so far regarding the length of time Israeli troops would be stationed in the Syrian buffer zone. During a visit Tuesday to the military post at the peak of Mount Hermon, Katz assessed the current security situation and spoke with military officers about operational activities to safeguard Israel's border and to defend against hostile forces. 'I’m here to make sure the IDF is fully prepared, both defensively and offensively, for an extended presence at the Hermon posts,' Katz said. 'The IDF will remain on the summit of Mount Hermon and in the security zone for an indefinite period to safeguard the Golan Heights, northern communities, and all citizens of Israel,' he continued. 'We will not return to the horrors of October 7, nor will we rely on others for our defense—here or anywhere else. We place our full trust in the IDF’s commanders and soldiers, both regular and reserve, to ensure the security of Israel’s residents,' Katz stated. He added, 'We will not allow hostile forces to establish a foothold in the security zone in southern Syria and will take decisive action against any emerging threats.' Katz explained that Israel would strive to maintain friendly relations with local populations, with special emphasis on the Druze, given their history of solidarity with Israel. In December, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Israel's newly acquired positions in Syria. Netanyahu said the visit was intended 'to determine the best arrangement' for ensuring Israel’s security. 'I am here at the summit of Mount Hermon,' he said. 'It brings back memories. Fifty-three years ago, I was here with my soldiers on a patrol with the Israel Defense Forces. The place hasn’t changed; it’s still the same. But its significance to Israel’s security has only increased in recent years, especially in light of the dramatic events unfolding below us in Syria in recent weeks.'

Trump’s pick for FBI director faces accusations of jeopardizing s...	The mounting evidence of Patel’s alleged misconduct has galvanized opposition to his nomination hearing this Thursday. By Jewish Breaking News Explosive new allegations have surfaced questioning Kash Patel’s judgment as his confirmation hearing for FBI director fast approaches. According to CBS, a former FBI official has come forward to Senate Democrats with damaging claims that Patel disregarded established security protocols during a 2020 hostage recovery mission in Yemen. While serving at the National Security Council, Patel allegedly leaked details of the delicate prisoner exchange to the Wall Street Journal before the Americans were safely in U.S. custody. It sent shockwaves through the FBI’s Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell who viewed the leak as an unconscionable breach of protocol. This wasn’t an isolated incident either. During a high-stakes rescue operation in late 2020, Navy SEAL Team 6 was tasked with rescuing American citizen Philip Walton, who had been abducted from his farm in Niger and taken across the border to Nigeria. The kidnappers demanded a $1 million ransom for Walton’s release, and intelligence suggested they were considering transferring him to a terrorist group operating in the region. To save Walton, the SEALs needed to parachute into northern Nigeria and trek for miles to reach the compound where Walton was being held. Dangerously, Patel incorrectly assured Defense Department officials that diplomatic clearance had been obtained from Nigeria for U.S. forces to enter their airspace. While ultimately Walton was successfully rescued, Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper later wrote in his memoir that Patel’s actions had needlessly endangered the SEAL team by pushing them to their operational limits before the assault phase even began. The mounting evidence of Patel’s alleged misconduct has galvanized opposition to his nomination hearing this Thursday. Senator Dick Durbin has already declared his intention to vote against confirmation, stating unequivocally that Patel 'has neither the experience, the temperament, nor the judgment to lead the FBI.' However, Patel’s allies have rushed to his defense, dismissing the allegations as politically motivated attacks. Alex Gray, a former National Security Council chief of staff, praised Patel’s leadership capabilities, describing his tenure as marked by exceptional skill and professionalism, and credited him as a key contributor to Trump’s foreign policy team during his first term as president.

UNSC to address crisis at UNRWA ahead of Israeli ban	Danon stressed that months of talks with the United Nations to address the situation have been met with 'blatant disregard.' By Joshua Marks, JNS The United Nations Security Council is set to convene on Tuesday to address the escalating crisis at the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which Israel has outlawed citing allegations that Hamas terrorists were employed by the agency. Algeria, which assumed the Security Council presidency in January, requested the meeting. This will be the second Council session this month dedicated to UNRWA’s situation. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini and Norwegian Refugee Council Secretary-General Jan Egeland are expected to brief the assembly during the session. Israel notified the United Nations on Saturday that it must evacuate all UNRWA premises in Jerusalem no later than Jan. 30, as Knesset legislation banning the agency’s operations within the Jewish state will take effect on Thursday. 'Israel expects that UNRWA [will] take all the necessary steps to cease its operations in Jerusalem and evacuate all premises in which it operates in the city within the stated time frame,' wrote Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon in a letter addressed to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres. Outlawing UNRWA in Israel 'came as a direct response to the acute national security risks posed by the widespread infiltration of UNRWA’s ranks by Hamas and other terrorist organizations, and the agency’s persistent refusal to address the very grave and material concerns raised by Israel, and to remedy this intolerable situation,' the letter notes. Danon stressed that months of talks with the United Nations to address the situation have been met with 'blatant disregard.' On Nov. 4, the Israeli parliament terminated the 1967 agreement outlining the terms of its relations with UNRWA. The director general of Israel’s Foreign Ministry sent a letter to U.N. General Assembly President Philémon Yang of Cameroon explaining that Jerusalem 'withdraws its request issued to UNRWA,' and instead 'will continue to work with international partners, including other United Nations agencies, to ensure the facilitation of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not undermine Israel’s security.' Then-Foreign Minister Israel Katz said, 'UNRWA, whose employees took part in the Oct. 7 massacre and many of whose workers are Hamas operatives, is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip, not part of the solution.' The United Nations was 'provided with countless pieces of evidence regarding Hamas operatives who work at UNRWA and about the use of UNRWA facilities for terrorism, and nothing was done,' he added. Lazzarini has warned that the Israeli actions against UNRWA would worsen humanitarian conditions, disrupt the social system and erode Palestinian trust in the international community. Lazzarini also cautioned that banning UNRWA could undermine the fragile ceasefire established on Jan. 19 after more than 15 months of war. He emphasized UNRWA’s essential role, noting it has already provided food aid to over one million people in Gaza during the ceasefire, and stressed the need for the agency’s continued operations to prevent further humanitarian collapse.

Israel shuts down Raed Salah’s ‘Afsha’a Al-Islam’ committees for ...	Salah, who heads the committees, has been arrested several times for incitement in sermons and on social media, and for fundraising for Hamas. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli government declared the 'Afsha’a Al-Islam' committees led by Sheikh Raed Salah a terrorist organization and shut down its offices in Umm al-Fahm on Tuesday. Defense Minister Israel Katz signed the order citing intelligence indicating that the committees are affiliated with the outlawed Northern Faction of the Islamic Movement, which is linked to Hamas. The better-known Hamas is the Muslim Brotherhood’s Palestinian branch while the Islamic Movement was founded as the Israeli branch. The Islamic Movement split in 1996 over the issue of participating in Israeli elections. The Southern Branch, regarded as more pragmatic, is active in Israeli politics. Its party, Ra’am, has five seats in the Israeli Knesset and supported the formation of Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid’s government in 2021 — the first time an Israeli-Arab party ever formally backed a governing coalition. The Northern Branch, led by Salah, was outlawed in Israel in 2015 over its close ties with Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. The Northern Faction is especially active in Jerusalem. It created the Mourabitoun, a squad of Palestinian men and women specifically to harass Jews visiting the Temple Mount. Jews who appear to be possibly praying may be shouted at, cursed and even physically assaulted by the Mourabitoun. Many are equipped with computers and iPads to record their activities for Hamas media. They are also known for flying Hamas flags and banners on the Temple Mount. Salah, who heads the committees, has been arrested several times for incitement in sermons and on social media, and for fundraising for Hamas.

The full details of Netanyahu’s trip could be announced after Wednesday’s scheduled visit to Jerusalem by U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington next week, Hebrew media reported on Tuesday. While Netanyahu’s visit to the United States has not been finalized, the reported plans are for him to depart on Sunday and return two days later. Asked about the prospects for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians aboard Air Force One on Monday, Trump revealed he would be discussing the issue with Netanyahu during a meeting in Washington 'in the not-too-distant future.' Following earlier reports about the possible visit, Israeli Prime Minister’s Office Spokesperson Omer Dostri said in a statement posted to social media that, 'contrary to reports, an official invitation for the prime minister to visit the White House has not yet been received.' 'If and when an official invitation to visit is received, we will follow all accepted procedures,' added Dostri. According to unnamed American officials cited by AFP on Tuesday, the full details of Netanyahu’s trip could be announced after Wednesday’s scheduled visit to Jerusalem by U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff.

The last Jews of Damascus: A journey through memory and ruins	Seven old Jews, a locked synagogue, and a ruin. That’s what remains of the Jewish community of Syria. By Jonathan Spyer, The Middle East Forum In Damascus again after a hiatus of nearly eight years, I decided to see what remained of the city’s once flourishing Jewish community. The dictator was gone. The new Islamist rulers had yet to fully stamp their authority on the city and the country. It seemed an ideal time. The Jewish Quarter of Damascus is located in the old city. There were 50,000 Jews in Syria at the beginning of the 20th century – an ancient and historic community dating to antiquity. The Jews of Syria were divided by city origin, with two old communities – Damascus and Aleppo – maintaining a rivalry. A third, newer community had been established later in Qamishli, in the Kurdish-majority northeast. There were 50,000 Jews in Syria at the beginning of the 20th century – an ancient and historic community dating to antiquity. The Jewish community was further subdivided into descendants of Sephardim who arrived after 1492, Jews of Italian descent, Kurdish Jews, and 'Musta’arabin' (Arabized) or Mizrahi Jews, whose families never left the Levant. Of these, the Jews of Aleppo and Qamishli have departed in their entirety. The seven or eight elderly Jewish residents of Damascus are the last remnant. (The exact number is disputed). My friend Firas and I set out from Bab Touma one Saturday morning to see what we could find. Firas is a Syrian Kurd, a former YPG (People’s Defense Units) fighter, and a former resident of Damascus. I had read that one of the three synagogues of the neighborhood, the Elfrange, still had services. I had the vague idea that I might arrive for the Saturday morning prayers and make the acquaintance of whomever I might find there. It took us a while to find the entrance to the synagogue. When we did, the door was padlocked. No one was around. We asked a neighboring shop owner what he knew about the 'Jewish synagogue.' 'Abu Ibrahim has the keys,' he replied. 'He runs a school here. But he isn’t here today. Give me your phone number and I’ll pass it on to him.' We did so without much hope. 'Do you know where we could find any of the Jews still living in the city?' I asked The shop owner considered for a moment. 'There’s an old woman living close by. But she’s lost her mind and can’t tell you much. Then there’s another old woman, two doors down from here. You see that black iron door? That’s where she lives. I think she’s there now. Go and knock and maybe she’ll answer.' So we did. No answer again. Dejected, and with a growing sense of absurdity, we wandered past the dilapidated houses, asking various passersby for clues. 'There’s a Jewish man living in that street right there,' a woman told us, pointing to a street on the left. 'His name’s Ibrahim.' We went down the small, dusty street and asked the owner of a small hummus restaurant whether he knew which house was Ibrahim’s. Our question caused an argument between the young man and his friend who was with him. 'Don’t know,' the friend told us. 'No idea. Don’t know.' Damascus is a city of deep suspicions, covered by a layer of slightly too-sweet politeness. But in this case, the young hummus restaurant owner took pity on us, and pointed to a ramshackle house opposite. 'He’s there. He lives there alone. But he might not answer.' 'He doesn’t want to speak to anyone,' his friend added. We went over and Firas hammered on the door. Once. Twice. And then, more or less despairingly, a third time. As we were about to leave, a small, elderly man appeared on the balcony facing the street. Firas shouted that I was a Jewish journalist who had come to find out about the Jews of Damascus. After a long pause, the old man pulled a string on the balcony that was attached to the front door and it clicked open. Inside, we found everything in an astonishing state of dereliction. Old bicycles, clocks, and ornaments, and rotting carpets and packing cases were all piled up in the courtyard and the adjoining rooms. This had very obviously once been a house owned by a wealthy family. Nothing remained of that. The old man motioned to us to come upstairs. We sat with him next to the balcony. While speaking Damascus Arabic, laced with Hebrew words here and there, he produced a phone with a Channel 11 report on the Jews of Damascus on it. He motioned to me to read the Hebrew. I did so and, satisfied, he began to tell us about himself and his family, the Hilwanis of Damascus. His name is Fuad Hilwani. Most of the family had left in 1992, he said, when Hafez Assad chose to allow the remaining 4,000 Jews in Syria to depart. He described the severely curtailed lives they had lived up to that point, under the pervasive surveillance of the regime’s intelligence branches. Jews needed permission even to leave the neighborhood. He had stayed to look after his ailing mother, who died a few years later. He had a brother in New York, and one in Israel. I congratulated him on his family’s house, saying it must have been illustrious at one time. He gave me a searching look, as though suspecting me of mockery. Then he said: 'This wasn’t our house. It belonged to the Totah family. I’m just watching it so that Abu Ibrahim and those behind him don’t come and take it.' Then he launched into a complicated account of efforts by a power structure connected to the old regime to move in on remaining Jewish properties in the city. He then mentioned a general connected to Maher Assad’s notorious 4th Division, a by-word for criminality and cruelty under the Assads. (Maher is former president Bashar al-Assad’s younger brother.) There had been violence and intimidation, and even an act of murder. I haven’t been able to fully verify these claims, so I won’t repeat them. At the end of this, Hilwani offered to read our fortunes, and following this bade us goodbye. 'Shabbat Shalom,' he wished me, as we stood on the stairs. Back at my hotel in Bab Touma, I searched for anything I could find on the Totah family and their properties in the Jewish Quarter. On a site that collects memories of the vanished Jewish communities of the Arab world, I found the following description: 'The Beit Tuta (also known as Beit Totah) was an opulent Damascene courtyard house owned by the Tuta family from the mid-19th to early 20th century. It boasted both traditional, open-air reception rooms and Western-style reception rooms.' I thought of the junk piled high in the courtyard and the rooms around it, and the old Jewish man, alone, its curious sentinel. THERE WAS still one synagogue I wanted to see – the Eliyahu Hanavi, in the neighborhood of Jobar, a couple of kilometers from the old city. It is described by the 13th-century Jewish traveler Samuel ben Samson as a 'beautiful synagogue situated outside the city' and by Israel Joseph Benjamin in 1864 as 'supported by 13 marble pillars, six on the right and seven on the left side, and everywhere inlaid with marble.' However, the synagogue was destroyed in 2014 during the Syrian civil war by a regime artillery shell. We found a local Jobar man to take us there, but there wasn’t much to see except rubble. Part of a single wall is still standing. I had heard that the area where the synagogue had stood was mined, but our guide immediately clambered up on it, so we followed suit. I saw that there was an UNRWA school close by, and I remembered that the Assad regime had a practice of housing Palestinian refugees close to traditionally Jewish areas of Damascus. After a couple of minutes, we had company. A motorcycle roared up. Two young men, both in black, one with a long black beard, the other wearing a leather jacket, climbed off. Representatives of the new regime. They climbed up to the highest point of the rubble that once was the Jobar synagogue and called us to join them. Out of breath, we did so. 'You can’t film there,' the bearded young man told us matter-of-factly. 'And no photos. This is a Jewish religious site. And of course, we respect all religions.' 'Who are you?' asked Firas, though it was obvious. 'We’re from the ‘organization’ [haya in Arabic, referring to Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham],' the bearded young man replied. 'And if you want to photograph, you should go to the Air Force Intelligence building at the Abbasin Circle, and get permission.' It wasn’t quite clear why having respect for all religions involved forbidding photography of a ruined synagogue. But we didn’t contest the point. After escorting us about 45 meters from the ruin, the two climbed back on their motorcycle and roared off through the dust. So that was the 'mukhabarat' (secret police) of the new regime, it occurred to me. Still learning the trade. The old lot would have checked my camera to see if I had already taken some pictures. They would learn quickly, no doubt. Fuad Hilwani had scoffed at my question whether he thought that the fall of Assad would change anything. Abu Ibrahim, he had said, would make a deal with the new regime, that was all. Fifty-fifty (i.e., of mutual benefit – to the new regime and to Abu Ibrahim). Seven old Jews, a locked synagogue, and a ruin. That’s what remains of the Jewish community of Syria.

PA continues unbridled building on nature reserve	Israeli groups demand government action with the Judean Desert ecosystem under dire threat from the massive illegal construction projects. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israeli groups demanded again Tuesday immediate government action to counter the Palestinian Authority’s ongoing unbridled building on what is supposed to be a protected nature reserve. 'The Judean Desert has more concrete than mountain goats, a dubious achievement, courtesy of the Palestinian Authority,' charged the Regavim Movement, an NGO dedicated to the protection of Israel's national lands and resources. 'We expect - we demand - substantial action to restore the fragile desert ecosystem, which has suffered too long from the Palestinian Authority's rampant illegal construction,' the group said. To illustrate how bad the problem is, Regavim released Tuesday together with the Gush Etzion and Har Hebron Regional Councils, a parody of National Geographic nature films that it called a 'National Catastrophic' documentary that featured 'The Desert Block.' Mimicking precisely the style of the famed series, it showed the desert landscape being destroyed by miles of roads, walls and buildings, while the narrator talks of how the concrete 'desert block knows no fear,' and 'conditions are ideal' so 'it grows wild,' constantly 'invading new areas, striking roots of steel and stone' while being 'sustained' by 'a constant flow of money from around the world.' The government has done nothing for years despite the massive Palestinian encroachment on what is known as the 'Wye-designated nature reserve,' which had been placed under PA jurisdiction in the 1998 Wye River Agreement that constituted the third part of the Oslo Accords. Last June, the Cabinet formally decided to enforce the law to try to belatedly prevent at least part of the decimation of its unique ecosystem. The first enforcement action was finally implemented last month, but only against illegal construction that had taken place since that decision. Even then, no further action was taken, although Regavim’s field coordinators quickly documented additional new development and construction work in the northern part of the reserve, as well as massive construction in the southern part, including road paving, electrical infrastructure and construction of multi-story structures. 'There is no vacuum. Wherever Israeli authorities are absent, hostile elements fill the void,' said Moshe Shmueli, one of the coordinators. 'After too many years of systematic destruction of the Judean Desert's natural resources, there's no time to lose - we must correct this immediately.' Gush Etzion Regional Council head Yaron Rosenthal noted that environmental groups, which should naturally be at the forefront of such a struggle, have not come to their aid. 'The Judean Desert is being systematically destroyed by the Palestinian Authority, with little response from environmental groups,' he said. 'We, who cherish the desert, and the nature, our environment and the Land of Israel, are committed to countering this damage and safeguarding our desert from further harm.'

Iranian FM calls to ‘expel Israelis to Greenland,’ warns against ...	Iran's foreign minister denounces Donald Trump's proposal to relocate 1.5 million Gazans, mockingly calls for deportation of Israeli Jews to Greenland, while warning of a 'very bad disaster' if US or Israel attack Iran's nuclear program. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Iran's foreign minister derided President Donald Trump's proposal to relocate two-thirds of the population of the Gaza Strip to third-party countries, mockingly suggesting instead that Israel's population be deported to Greenland. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi spoke with Britain's Sky News in an interview aired on Tuesday, warning against potential airstrikes by Israel or the U.S. against Iran's nuclear program, calling any such strike 'crazy,' and suggesting it would lead to a 'very bad disaster.' 'We have made it clear,' Araghchi said, 'that any attack to our nuclear facilities would be faced with an immediate and decisive response. But I don't think they will do that crazy thing. This is really crazy. And this would turn the whole region into a very bad disaster.' Araghchi said Tehran is willing to work with Trump, despite his withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal during his first term, and the imposition of tough sanctions on Iran. But the foreign minister mocked the president's efforts to find countries willing to take in large numbers of Gazan refugees, as well as Trump's proclaimed desire to acquire Greenland from Denmark. 'My suggestion is something else,' Araghchi said. 'Instead of Palestinians, try to expel Israelis, take them to Greenland so they can kill two birds with one stone.' Turning to Iran's battered proxies, Araghchi acknowledged that Hamas and Hezbollah 'have been weakened,' but emphasized that both groups are 'rebuilding themselves.' 'Hamas and Hezbollah have been damaged. But at the same time, they are rebuilding themselves, because as I said, this is a school of thought, this is an idea, this is a cause, this is an ideal that will always be there.'

In statement marking 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, President Trump calls for 'end to antisemitism,' while celebrating the 're-founding' of the Jewish national home in Israel. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump called for an 'end to antisemitism' Monday night, while celebrating the establishment of the state of Israel in a statement issued marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. In his statement, released Monday night, the president called the Holocaust, and specifically the genocide at Auschwitz-Birkenau, 'one of the darkest chapters in human history.' Trump lamented the persistence of antisemitism around the globe, and called for its eradication in the U.S. 'The poison of anti-Semitism still courses through the veins of cowards in dark corners of the world. So today, we renew our promise that anti-Semitism has no place in a civilized society, no place in our foreign policy, and no place in the United States of America.' In a nod to historical Jewish claims to the Land of Israel, the president not only reasserted America's 'bonds of friendship with the State of Israel,' but also hailed the creation of the modern State of Israel in 1948 as the 'refounding' of the Jewish national home. 'In the years since the liberation of Auschwitz on this day eight decades ago, the grave offenses that took place during the Holocaust and the cries of the Jewish people have echoed throughout the halls of history,' Trump said. 'In the wake of the oppression, persecution, and injustice committed at Auschwitz and elsewhere in Europe, the Jewish people gallantly persevered to re-found their homeland in the modern State of Israel — our mighty friend. To this day, the Jewish people proudly represent the peak of human tenacity and the pinnacle of human triumph.'

Freed hostage – ‘There are two million terrorists in Gaza’	Albag was one of four soldiers released Saturday who disrupted Hamas’ attempt to humiliate them on a stage, showing their spirits were unbroken. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Liri Albag, one of the four IDF soldiers released Saturday by Hamas in exchange for 200 terrorists, told her father that no one was innocent in Gaza, her father reported to 103FM Monday. 'Liri told me, ‘Dad, there are two million terrorists, make no mistake. I sat with an eight-year-old boy, and with four-year-old children who would say 'We spit on the Jews,' do you understand what that means?’' Eli Albag told interviewers Yinon Magal and Ben Caspit. When asked how his daughter was treated in captivity, he answered that as there are still hostages in danger in Gaza, he couldn’t talk freely, 'but let’s just say they aren’t our friends. They are our enemy who want to kill us.' 'We have to get everyone back and be on guard,' he continued, 'and if they shoot the tiniest thing [at Israel] they should be obliterated.' He also talked about the show of humiliation Hamas tried to put on before letting the young women go, setting up a stage where the four were presented to a crowd of hostile Arabs. 'The Hamas terrorists demanded that the girls speak, so Liri and the others said, ‘Not only will we not speak, we’re going to make a victory gesture and ruin the whole show for them.’ As soon as they made the gesture they took the girls off the stage,' Albag said. As seen by millions around the world, the four raised their arms and waved to the crowd, pointed forefingers in the air to signal they were 'No. 1,' and made the 'V' for victory sign, all the while smiling jubilantly, showing that their spirits had not been broken after 15 months of harsh imprisonment. 'She told me that had they let her speak she would have said one sentence in Arabic – ‘My name is Liri Albag and I’m number one,’' he recounted. The proud father talked of his daughter’s strength, saying that its extent surprised her family, and called her a hero. He said that his daughter had hinted that she had saved the life of Amit Soussana, a 40-year-old kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza and released along with some 85 women and children in the week-long hostage deal in late November 2023. Soussana, who was the first former hostage to describe publicly how she had been sexually abused and tortured in captivity, will reveal the details that Liri would not talk about on the news show Uvda Tuesday night, he said. Albag took the opportunity on the radio to clarify that his harsh words the previous day against those who opposed the current hostage deal, where he said in part that 'The people will hold you accountable,' were only directed at the country’s leaders. 'God forbid, I don't judge bereaved families,' he said. 'They are our soul. It is thanks to the fallen that my children are here.' 'Every bereaved family has the right to say what they want &#8230; and I will accept everything with love from them. God forbid that what I said is taken out of context,' he added. Bereaved families of fallen soldiers and especially families of those murdered by all the Palestinian prisoners released in the deal so far have spoken out against the agreement, believing it to be a moral capitulation and a future security nightmare for Israel that will cost the lives of many more victims of terror in the future.

Washington Post cites sanctioned terror financier Samidoun in sym...	The U.S. Department of Treasury slapped sanctions on Samidoun just months ago for providing material support to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a terrorist organization that participated in Hamas's Oct. 7 terror attack. By Lexi Boccuzzi, The Washington Free Beacon The Washington Post cited the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, an anti-Semitic organization under U.S. sanctions for providing material support to terrorists, in a sympathetic piece highlighting the 'Palestinian prisoners' freed as part of the Israel-Hamas hostage deal. The Post described Samidoun as an 'activist network supporting Palestinian prisoners' and linked to a blog post on the group's website titled, '90 Palestinian prisoners liberated by the Resistance on the first day of the Flood of the Free.' The blog included photos from Gaza featuring Hamas flags and photos of the terror group's deceased leader, Yahya Sinwar. It also noted that '90 Palestinian prisoners were liberated from the jails of the Zionist occupation regime in the first day of the Flood of the Free (Toufan al-Ahrar) prisoner exchange, achieved by the Palestinian Resistance as part of the first stage of the ceasefire agreement imposed by the occupier.' The Post did not note that the U.S. Department of Treasury slapped sanctions on Samidoun just months ago for providing material support to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a terrorist organization that participated in Hamas's Oct. 7 terror attack. It did, however, cite Samidoun to assert that the freed 'Palestinian prisoners' include 'journalists, activists, teachers, students, and close relatives of high-profile Hamas figures.' The Post went on to highlight a number of the released 'prisoners,' including one member of the PFLP, which the outlet described as 'a small leftist armed group.' In another case, the Post described Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a terror organization that is holding Israeli hostage Arbel Yehoud, a female civilian, as a 'militant group.' The piece reflects the extreme anti-Israel bias seen at the Post in the wake of Oct. 7. As of last summer, at least six members of the Post's foreign desk previously wrote for Al Jazeera, the Doha-based news outlet bankrolled in part by Qatar's Hamas-friendly government, the Washington Free Beacon reported. The Department of Treasury, in a joint action with Canada's government, announced its Samidoun sanctions in October, describing the group as 'a sham charity that serves as an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) terrorist organization.' The punitive measures bar U.S. citizens from doing business with Samidoun, and the group must forfeit any properties held in the country. The Post's decision to cite Samidoun in the wake of those sanctions aligns the outlet with some of the country's most extreme anti-Israel student groups. In November, less than a month after the Department of Treasury unveiled the sanctions, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) distributed pamphlets encouraging classmates to 'get involved' with Samidoun, the Free Beacon reported. The pamphlets called for 'revolution and resistance until liberation and return' and encouraged readers to 'let your discomfort be your radicalization' and 'kill the beast from within.' A QR code on the pamphlets, like the Post's article, led to a webpage that directed visitors to Samidoun's site. CUAD is a coalition of Columbia University student groups that formed after the school suspended its Students for Justice in Palestine chapter. The coalition was instrumental in organizing the illegal encampments that plagued Columbia in the spring. Its members distributed the pamphlets just outside of Columbia's gates, and experts argued that they may have provided material support to a terror organization by doing so. 'A reasonable argument could be made that whoever produced these flyers are providing material support to a designated terrorist organization,' Foundation for Defense of Democracies senior vice president for research Jonathan Schanzer told the Free Beacon at the time. 'In short, Samidoun shouldn't be anywhere in the United States anymore.' Niha Masih, one of the Post's authors of the piece, has a long history of accusing Israel of genocide. In a 2014 social media post, she wrote, 'For those gtng gleeful by Hamas rocket video pls rmbr Israel has killed more than 1800 civilians in #Gaza - any othr place it wd be genocide.' The Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Iranian FM: ‘Crazy’ US or Israeli attack on nuke sites won’t happ...	Trump on Jan. 23 said he hoped that Israel would not attack Iran’s nuclear faculties, but appeared to suggest that this was a possibility if the Islamic Republic does not accept a deal on its nuclear program. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday that he does not believe that the United States or Israel will attack Tehran’s nuclear facilities, calling the idea 'really crazy' in an interview with Sky News Arabia. 'This is not a new threat. And they know that this is not a real threat,' the Iranian diplomat told the U.K. broadcaster. 'They know our capabilities to respond, and we have made it clear that any attack to our nuclear facilities would be faced with an immediate and decisive response.' He continued: 'I don’t think that they will do that crazy thing. This is really crazy,' adding that a strike inside the Islamic Republic would immediately turn the entire region into 'a very bad disaster.' While Iran was prepared to listen to U.S. President Donald Trump, 'lots of things should be done by the other side' for Tehran to commit to negotiating a new nuclear deal with Washington, he said. 'There should be enough confidence for Iran to once again engage into negotiations, and I think we are still a bit far from that—as I said, we are waiting to hear. Yes, to have a deal is nice, of course, but what kind of a deal?' said the Iranian diplomat. 'Diplomacy is based on hopes. So we never lose our hopes for any diplomatic effort and for any initiative.' Asked by Sky News about concerns regarding the Islamic regime’s threats to pursue an 'alternative course' if diplomacy with the United States failed, Araghchi claimed he did not know what Tehran would do. 'We tried the path of negotiations and confidence-building in our peaceful nuclear program,' he said, echoing the Islamic Republic’s oft-repeated claim that it has ramped up uranium enrichment for civilian purposes only. 'But then it turned into a bad experience. Sanctions came back. So what is the alternative? I don’t know,' he added. He claimed that there was an ongoing 'hot debate' inside Iran 'at all levels' regarding what the nation should do if nuclear diplomacy fails. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 85, is believed to have the final say on whether or not the country accepts a nuclear agreement. Trump on Jan. 23 said he hoped that Israel would not attack Iran’s nuclear faculties, but appeared to suggest that this was a possibility if the Islamic Republic does not accept a deal on its nuclear program. 'We’ll have to see. I’m going to be meeting with various people over the next couple of days. Hopefully, that can be worked out without having to worry about it,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the possibility of an Israeli strike, according to a readout. 'It would really be nice if that could be worked out without having to go that further step. Hopefully, that can be worked out. Iran hopefully will make a deal, and if they don’t make a deal, I guess that’s OK too,' he said. During his first term in 2018, Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 JCPOA nuclear agreement with Iran and stepped up sanctions on the regime in Tehran. The deal offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for its promise to dial back its nuclear program for a maximum of 10 years. Before he began his second term as president, Trump said he planned to renew his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran, including by issuing punishing sanctions and targeting Tehran’s oil revenue. Britain’s The Daily Telegraph cited anonymous Iranian government officials as saying over the weekend that the Islamic regime regards Trump’s return to the White House as 'an existential threat.' 'In Iraq and Yemen, [Iranian proxy] forces have been told not to target any American assets, and if they do, they are explicitly warned against using Iranian weapons,' the senior official told the daily. 'They have been told to keep defensive positions for a while and to avoid any actions that might provoke the Americans.' Araghchi in the interview with Sky News Arabia on Tuesday confirmed that the Islamic Republic regards Trump’s second term as commander-in-chief as 'different and much more difficult than the previous time.' Commenting on Trump’s suggestion to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza and build a life somewhere else, primarily in other Arab nations, the diplomat told Sky News that 'Palestinians cannot be expelled.' 'My suggestion is something else: Instead of Palestinians, try to expel Israelis. Take them to Greenland, so they can kill two birds with one stone,' he said, referencing Trump’s plans to purchase the territory. Araghchi dismissed the assassination of Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah by Israel, as well as the fall of allied dictator Bashar Assad in Syria, as 'things that happen in the world.' Switching to Farsi, he said that while 'the resistance has been rendered several serious blows, we have to know that resistance is a school of thought; a cause that is still alive, it is still there and is still breathing.' 'It is true that Hamas and Hezbollah have been damaged,' Araghchi acknowledged. 'At the same time, they are rebuilding themselves,' he said, vowing that the two Iranian-backed groups will 'always be there.' Earlier this month, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian denied to NBC that Tehran had suffered major defeats during recent conflicts, in which Israel incapacitated its strongest proxy, Hezbollah, in Lebanon. 'We’re more coherent, we’re more robust, we have better participation, we have a more solid security in the country,' the Iranian president claimed in a rare interview with the American television network.

Palestinian statehood a ‘red-line’ for Saudi-Israel normalization...	There is no other solution than the two-state solution,' says Saudi prince and diplomat, insisting that any deal between Riyadh and Jerusalem must include Israel's agreement to the establishment of a Palestinian state. By World Israel News Staff Palestinian statehood is a 'red line' for Saudi Arabia's acceptance of a deal normalizing relations with Israel, a senior member of the Saudi royal family said over the weekend. Riyadh's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Prince Khalid bin Bandar, spoke with Times Radio in an interview aired on Sunday, discussing, among other things, the Trump administration's efforts to expand the Abraham Accords and the possibility of achieving full diplomatic relations with Israel. 'We cannot have a normalization with Israel without a solution for the Palestinians. And the solution for the Palestinians is a state, it is very clear,' the ambassador said, when asked what it would take for Riyadh to join the Abraham Accords. 'That doesn't mean we can't have discussions. Saudi Arabia is a country that engages with everyone, whether we like it or not,' bin Bandar continued, emphasizing that Palestinian statehood is one of his country's 'red lines' for agreeing to normalize relations with Israel. 'We believe engagement is the way to move things forward, and so we are happy to continuously engage in processes with anyone, but we do have some red lines, and for us to end the last 75 years of pain and suffering caused by one problem has to include a Palestinian state.' Bin Bandar said it would be 'difficult' to secure a deal with the current Israeli government, but said the obstacles were not insurmountable. 'I mean, it's difficult, otherwise, we'd have been there. We would have found the solution. But let's not forget, this plot of land has been fought over consistently for 6,000 years.' 'It is not an easy thing to find, whether it's during the Crusades, before every civilization on earth, certainly in the three continents of Asia, Africa, and Europe has fought over the same plot of land. I can't think of anywhere that's had that much done to it.' The 47-year-old Saudi envoy said he was not optimistic regarding the prospects for a deal with Israel in the near future 'because we have a lot of problems in the way,' while acknowledging the legitimate concerns of Israelis following the Hamas invasion of October 7th, 2023. 'We also have to remember, there's another side, we have to find a solution that fits the Israelis.' 'That adds a level of complication, particularly with the current government in Israel, but I think we have to address, when someone is struggling through emotion and trauma and difficulty, which both the Israelis and the Palestinians have been for the last year, you have to hold them, you have to be kind to them, you have to be soft with them, but you also have to be very straight, and we have to be more straight with the Israelis and say, look, this is the only option.'

Trump pushes Gazan relocation plan in call with Egyptian presiden...	I'd like to get Gazans living somewhere they can live without disruption,' Trump says, doubling down on call for Egypt and Jordan to take in Gazan refugees. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump is continuing his push to find third-party countries to host Gaza refugees, despite initial opposition to his plan. Speaking with reporters on Air Force One on Monday while en route to Joint Base Andrews, the president discussed his telephone call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday. Over the weekend, Trump spoke with both Jordan’s King Abdullah II and al-Sisi about the prospect of the two countries taking in some of the roughly 1.5 million Gazans the Trump administration hopes to relocate as part of a voluntary mass migration during which the Gaza Strip could be rehabilitated and rebuilt. In his comments to the press over the weekend, Trump said the move could be either temporary or 'long-term.' While the Egyptian Foreign Ministry immediately rejected the proposal, calling it an 'infringement' on the rights of Palestinian Arabs, Trump said that when he discussed the plan with al-Sisi, the Egyptian president responded by calling for 'peace in the Middle East.' 'His response [was] that he’d like to see peace in the Middle East,' Trump said. 'I’d like to see peace in the Middle East.' 'I’d like to get them living in an area where they can live without disruption and revolution and violence,' the president continued. 'When you look at the Gaza Strip it’s been hell for so many years.' 'It just seems to me there's been various civilizations on that Strip and, you know, it didn't start here. It started thousands of years before, and there's always been violence associated with it.' 'So I think you could get people living in areas that are a lot safer and maybe a lot better and maybe a lot more comfortable.' Trump reiterated his call for Egypt to 'take some' of Gaza’s displaced residents. 'I wish [Sisi] would take some [Gazans]. We helped them a lot, and I'm sure he'd help us. He's a friend of mine. He's in a very rough part of the world, to be honest. As they say, It's a rough neighborhood. But I think he would do it, and I think the King of Jordan would do it too.' The Trump administration has also reportedly reached out to other countries, including Albania and Indonesia - both of which have Muslim majorities - for his Gaza relocation plan. The president declined to say whether he still supports Palestinian statehood, and responded to questions in that vein by stating that he will be 'speaking with Bibi Netanyahu in the not-too-distant future.' 'He's coming here to meet with me,' Trump continued, adding that the meeting will be 'very soon.' Two sources cited by The Times of Israel said that the Prime Minister’s Office is in talks with Washington for a trip to Washington beginning next Sunday and concluding the following Wednesday.

‘Don’t return home, Hezbollah still a danger’ – Mayor to northern...	If someone thinks these concrete slabs will stop Hezbollah, they are mistaken,' says Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avichai Stern. By World Israel News Staff The mayor of Kiryat Shmona slammed the defense and security establishment for failing to secure the northern border, even after 15 months of war against the Hezbollah terror group, in a fiery video posted to social media on Monday. Avichai Stern, the mayor of Israel's northernmost city, called on residents not to return to their homes until the state provides proper protection against a potential Hezbollah invasion. According to official statements, northerners are slated to return to evacuated cities and towns by March 1, 2025. Clad in a bulletproof vest, Stern filmed himself standing near the Israel-Lebanon border fence, adjacent to the Margaliot moshav. Pointing to a chain link fence that had been smashed to the ground, Stern noted that the border appeared to be completely unsecured in the area. He gestured towards large concrete slabs, which did not form a complete barrier and appeared to have been haphazardly placed along the border as a temporary solution. 'Tell me, have we learned nothing?' Stern said, filming past the fence towards a valley, which is Lebanese territory. From the video, it appears that Hezbollah operatives could easily make their way from the other end of the valley into Israel. 'These concrete slabs are really going to stop Hezbollah terrorists? They're going to prevent the next October 7th massacre in the north?' Stern continued, saying that 'if someone thinks these concrete slabs will stop Hezbollah, they are mistaken.' They mayor said that 'it really looks like we've learned nothing from October 7th. This is how we remove threats? They're telling us it's safe to come home when this is the situation?' He sarcastically added that 'maybe [the authorities] will tell us to just live inside of our bomb shelters.' Visibly angry, Stern concluded by saying that 'this is no how you provide security to the residents of the north.'

‘I wanted to make easy money’ – IDF reservist on spying for Iran	My son is an Israeli patriot, he was raised that way, in uniform from the age of 14,' says father of accused Iranian spy. By World Israel News Staff One of the IDF reservists recently arrested on charges of spying for Iran claimed to investigators that he was looking to 'make easy money,' according to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Mako. The indictment filed against Yuri Eliasfov, 21, who served in the IDF's Iron Dome unit, states that he sent a video of the air defense system's internal systems and technology to an Iranian agent, in exchange for payment. During his interrogation, Eliasfov claimed that he had reached out to an Iranian handler in order to 'make easy money.' He referred to the Iranian as a 'sucker' whom he believed he could 'take advantage of,' and added that 'at no point did I endanger IDF soldiers.' After carrying out several tasks for the Iranian, Eliasfov recruited his friend Georgy Andreyev, also 21. Andreyev is facing much less serious charges for crimes, including spray-painting pro-Iran graffiti. Eliasfov reportedly received $2,500 for his participation, and Andreyev just $50. Speaking to Hebrew-language outlet Ynet, Andreyev's parents vehemently denied that he would have knowingly acted on behalf of Iran. 'My son is an Israeli patriot - he was raised that way too,' Andreyev's father, also named Georgy, said. 'He studied at at a military school from the age of 14, served three years in the army, and volunteered for the reserves. His mother and I have no doubt that he would never do anything to aid our enemies.' A neighbor of the Eliasfov family expressed shock about his arrest. 'Yuri served in the army and the reserves. He was a source of pride to everyone in the neighborhood, including me,' they told Ynet. 'The [Eliasfov] family is very nice, two parents and four children. I hear the suspicions against Yuri and it kills me. It's hard for me to believe that he did it for money. The family doesn't have a financial problem, they are a normal, ordinary family.'

Israeli president accuses United Nations of ‘moral bankruptcy’ du...	Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Israel's president castigates the UN, claiming the body has become 'weaponized' by terrorists and demonstrating 'moral bankruptcy' after October 7th. By World Israel News Staff Israeli President Isaac Herzog addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, castigating the international body during a special session marking International Holocaust Memorial Day and the 80th anniversary of the the liberation of Auschwitz. Repeatedly invoking the UN's history of anti-Israel bias and its refusal to side with the Jewish state after the Hamas invasion of October 7th, Herzog accused the UN of falling short of the principles upon which it was established during World War II. 'How is it possible that international institutions, which began as an anti-Nazi alliance, are allowing antisemitic genocidal doctrines to flourish uninterrupted in the wake of the largest massacre of Jews since World War II?' Herzog noted the yellow ribbon pin on his lapel, worn in honor of the Israeli hostages still held captive in the Gaza Strip. 'I stand before you as president of a nation that is determined and proud, and yet - anguished and incomplete. Although the Israeli people have been overcome with emotion seeing seven of our daughters at last emerge heroically from hell - still, ninety Israelis and foreign nationals remain in Hamas captivity.' 'We are anxiously awaiting six more to be freed this week, and awaiting all others. I call on all representatives in this General Assembly, all who consider themselves part of the civilized world, to throw your weight to ensure our hostages return to their homes - every single one of them. Bring them home now!' The president repeatedly castigated the UN, accusing it of 'moral bankruptcy' and lamenting that many member states have lost their 'moral compass.' 'How is it possible that the moral compass of so many in the family of nations has become so disoriented, that they no longer recognize the clear truth: That just as terrorists use civilians as human shields, they also weaponize the international institutions, undermining the most basic, fundamental reason for their establishment?' 'How is it possible that the same institutions established in the wake of the greatest genocide in history – the Holocaust - are manipulating the definition of genocide for the sole purpose of attacking Israel and the Jewish people?' Herzog lashed out against other international institutions as well, including the International Criminal Court in The Hague, citing its November, 2024 arrest warrants issued against Israel's prime minister and former defense minister. 'Rather than fulfilling its purpose, and fighting courageously against a global epidemic of jihadist, murderous, and abhorrent terror, time and again this assembly has exhibited moral bankruptcy.' 'International forums and institutions such as the International Criminal Court opt for outrageous hypocrisy and protection of the perpetrators of the atrocities. They blur the distinction between good and evil, creating a distorted symmetry between the victim and the murderous monster.' He noted that terrorists who carried out the atrocities of October 7th took their inspiration from Nazism and Hitler. 'This is an urgent wake-up call for all of humanity: antisemitism, savagery, cruelty, and racism are still thriving on our planet.' Regarding Iran, the President pointed out the absurdity of Iran, as a UN member, threatening another member state without unequivocal condemnation. 'The world cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the threat posed by Iran to the entire world, and especially to the State of Israel,' he said, adding, 'This is a moment of truth for us all: We either bow our heads – or unite and take action to halt the danger.' The President stated that while criticism of Israel is legitimate, 'It is time to acknowledge: Challenging our right to exist is not diplomacy, it is plain antisemitism.'

Jerusalem braces for release of Second Intifada-era terrorists	Many of the terrorists released to eastern Jerusalem were critical actors within the murderous terror infrastructure of the Second Intifada,' warns NGO head. By World Israel News Staff The head of an NGO which advocates for Israeli sovereignty in the capital city is warning that Israel must prepare to meet the security challenges posed by the impending release of notorious terrorists during the ongoing ceasefire and hostage deal. Maor Tzemach, the chairman of Your Jerusalem, spoke to World Israel News about the significance of nearly 2,000 terrorists to eastern Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria. Tzemach stressed to WIN that the prisoners to be freed in the coming weeks have committed serious crimes against the State of Israel. Some of those to be freed are responsible for several of the deadliest terror attacks carried out in the Jerusalem area during the early 2000s. 'These terrorists being released to eastern Jerusalem were critical actors within the murderous terror infrastructure of the Second Intifada,' Tzemach told WIN. 'During that period, hundreds of Israeli civilians were murdered the streets of Jerusalem,' he said, warning that many of the planners and operatives of these attacks will soon be walking the streets of Israel's capital once again. Members of the the Silwan terror cell and the Hamas operative responsible for the the Line 32 bus massacre, which killed 29 Israelis, are set to be released in the near future. 'Residents of Jerusalem are experiencing great pain. Yes, we are extremely happy that the hostages are coming home, but on the other hand, we are paying a heavy price,' Tzemach said. In order to stymie a potential wave of terror following the release of the prisoners, 'the army needs to engage in an full-scale effort to cleanse Judea and Samaria of terror nests, like it did 20 years ago with Operation Cast Lead,' Tzemach told WIN. 'This needs to happen in Jenin, in Tulkarem, in Shechem (Nablus). There's no choice. In the next few months, we need to mow the lawn of terror to the lowest possible point. In Jerusalem, Israel needs to apply the same policy. Security forces must go house-by-house in eastern Jerusalem, seizing weapons and arresting terror operatives. We also have to clamp down on incitement wherever it's happening, especially in mosques.' Beyond the injustice of seeing mass murderers released after serving less than 20 years in prison, Tzemach said that Jerusalemites are concerned about a new wave of terror targeting the city. '80 percent of the terrorists released in the Shalit deal went back to terror,' he noted. 'We're concerned about 'new blood' flowing into existing terror cells in Jerusalem, and that's coupled with the huge pain that these Second Intifada-era terrorists did not serve out their full sentences.'

Freed hostages report spending months in tunnels without human co...	Some of the hostages were held in underground tunnels with no daylight and were deprived of human contact, sometimes for as long as eight months. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A number of hostages who have been released report having been confined for months in underground tunnels with no human contact, an Israeli general reported on Monday. Although many of the freed captives appeared cheerful and energetic upon their release, Eitan Gonen, father of Romi Gonen, cautioned that this was not a sign that Hamas treated the hostages well. Eitan Gonen told Walla, 'The smiles aren’t a reflection of the conditions they endured; they’re expressions of the hostages’ joy at being freed from the Nazis. If you were rescued from hell and someone extended their hand to you, wouldn’t you smile?' Some of the hostages were held in underground tunnels with no daylight and were deprived of human contact, sometimes for as long as eight months. 'Some of them were alone the entire time. Those who were together fared better,' said Colonel Dr. Avi Banov, deputy chief of the Israeli military’s medical corps, during an online press briefing. Under the current hostage release deal, seven women were freed in exchange for 290 Palestinian prisoners. Many of the hostages have experienced 'mild starvation' after being fed extremely meager rations of only rice or bread for over a year. Just prior to their release, Hamas allowed them to shower and provided additional food. According to reports, Hamas gave soon-to-be-released hostages extra food and stimulants to create the illusion that they were well-treated. Several of the hostages suffered serious injuries sustained on October 7th and did not receive adequate medical treatment during their captivity. Emily Damari lost three fingers after being shot in the hand on October 7th, and Daniella Gilboa has a bullet lodged in her leg, which will be surgically removed now that she has been released. Some of the hostages were able to hear news about the war on the radio, along with messages from their families. Eitan Gonen described the effect hearing such messages had on his daughter, Romi. 'Even if only 10% of the interviews reached the hostages’ ears, it was enough to give them strength,' he said. 'It gave her a lot of strength, energy, and great hope.'

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that he plans to implement U.S. President Donald Trump's emigration plan for Gaza. Trump is pressuring Egypt and Jordan to accept large numbers of refugees from the Gaza Strip, suggesting that the move could be either temporary or permanent. Smotrich said, 'Gaza is a breeding ground for violence that causes suffering for both the people of Israel and the residents of Gaza.' He explained that Arab states have allowed the Gaza issue to fester, using it as a 'weapon' against Israel. Smotrich added, 'It is clear that, in the long term, promoting emigration is the only solution that can bring peace and security to the people of Israel while also easing the suffering of Gaza's Arab residents.' 'I am working together with the Prime Minister and the cabinet to develop an operational plan and ensure that President Trump's vision is brought to fruition,' Smotrich said. Although Egypt and Jordan have rejected the plan, Smotrich dismissed their response as 'feeble opposition' and expressed confidence that Trump could pressure the countries into agreeing. Smotrich said, 'We saw yesterday how Trump led a move against Colombia to expel migrants despite its opposition. When he wants something to happen, it happens.' Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump described the war-torn coastal enclave as 'a real mess' and said he expected Jordan and Egypt to take in the bulk of Gaza’s population, which numbers around 2.2 million people. In discussing his phone call with Jordanian King Abdullah II on Saturday, Trump said he hopes the monarch will 'take people' into his kingdom. 'I said to him, ‘I’d love you to take on more because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it’s a mess; it’s a real mess.' I’d like him to take people.' Trump also mentioned his upcoming call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, scheduled for Sunday, saying he has a similar message for Cairo, hoping to secure refuge for around 1.5 million Gazans.

Holocaust survivors’ fear losing reparations over facial recognit...	For these individuals, the task of downloading and using a smartphone app, managing a steady camera, and navigating technical instructions is daunting, if not insurmountable. By Pesach Benson, TPS A controversial new requirement for Holocaust survivors to prove their existence using a facial recognition app has sparked frustration and anger among some Holocaust survivors The move, announced by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (Claims Conference), mandates that approximately 70,000 survivors globally must annually verify their identity via the 'Paneem' app starting in 2025. The measure was enacted to comply with demands from the German government. As of 2024, the German government has paid approximately $90 billion in indemnification to individuals for suffering and losses resulting from Nazi persecution through negotiations from the Claims Conference. In 2024, the Claims Conference distributed approximately $535 million in direct compensation to over 115,000 survivors in 84 countries and allocated approximately $888 million in grants to over 300 social service agencies worldwide that provide vital services for Holocaust survivors, such as home care, food, and medicine. However, advocates for survivors living in Israel criticized the app as an unnecessary technological and bureaucratic burden on elderly individuals. 'This requirement is a significant obstacle for survivors, especially those without family support. Given their advanced age and health conditions, we should be making their lives easier, not more difficult,' said Orly Sivan, CEO of the Tel Aviv-based Aviv Association for Holocaust Survivors. 'As an organization that is well aware of the difficulties and bureaucratic barriers that Holocaust survivors face in exercising their rights, we are very concerned about the implications of the new requirement that does not take into account the situation and cognitive and digital abilities of Holocaust survivors in Israel,' she added. A spokesperson for the Claims Conference told TPS-IL that the Paneem app is 'successfully operating' in most countries where survivors now live. She added that after three weeks, more than half of the Holocaust survivors living in Israel successfully registered. 'This achievement was made possible thanks to the various support channels operated by the Claims Conference in collaboration with organizations supporting the Holocaust survivor population in Israel,' the spokesperson said. 'We are aware of the challenges related to this new system for survivors in Israel and are working closely with organizations, authorities, and government ministries to provide the most comprehensive assistance to Holocaust survivors. The Claims Conference is committed to ensuring that all Holocaust survivors receive their full entitlements and will not stand down until every survivor in Israel is registered,' she added. The average age of Holocaust survivors in Israel is 87, with many living alone and grappling with health limitations. 'Considering their advanced age, their health condition, and the challenges that come with this age, the expectation is that it is precisely in these years that the bodies that pay compensation to Holocaust survivors will find ways to make things easier for Holocaust survivors and reduce the bureaucracy required to exercise their rights,' Sivan said. For these individuals, the task of downloading and using a smartphone app, managing a steady camera, and navigating technical instructions is daunting, if not insurmountable. The association said it has been inundated with complaints from survivors unable to download the app or understand how to use it. On Monday, the world commemorates International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland by Soviet soldiers in 1945.

New details emerge on Hamas’s new leader Mohammed Sinwar	Estimates now suggest that Hamas has approximately 15,000 new operatives, despite the heavy damage inflicted on its infrastructure by the IDF. By Jewish Breaking News New details have emerged regarding Hamas’s new leader in Gaza. Following his older brother Yahya Sinwar’s elimination by Israeli forces in October, the Wall Street Journal reported that Mohammed Sinwar took over direct command over Gaza operations and is now directing all negotiations with Israel. Under his leadership, Hamas has intensified recruitment efforts by promising food and medical assistance to families. Most of Mohammed's recruitment efforts reportedly take place at funerals and prayer gatherings. Estimates now suggest that Hamas has approximately 15,000 new operatives despite the heavy damage inflicted on its infrastructure by the IDF. According to the New York Post, the now 50-year-old brother was exposed to extremist ideology from very early on. While still a baby, his brother Yahya was already attending sermons by Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who was notorious for using the Quran to justify violence against Israel. During this period, Mohammed began developing a relationship with Mohammed Deif, who would later become one of the architects behind the October 7 massacre. With his brother already imprisoned in Israel at age 13 for terrorist attacks, by his late teens, Mohammed had already drawn his own unwanted attention. His first arrest in 1991 marked the beginning of a short but tumultuous period that would see him cycle through various prisons throughout the decade, including time in Palestinian custody under Israeli pressure. Mohammed is believed to be responsible for planning the kidnapping of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006. Dubbed ‘The Shadow’ for his ability to operate beneath the radar, Mahmoud turned the Shalit kidnapping into a family victory. The young Israeli soldier became valuable currency in a high-stakes prisoner swap that ultimately freed Yahya Sinwar from Israeli prison in 2011. The brothers’ bond would prove lethal. Together, they helped orchestrate the devastating attack against Israel that left more than 1,200 dead and saw 251 people taken hostage. Yahya is gone, and it’s only a matter of time before everyone responsible for that blood-soaked day is brought to justice.

Israeli female astronaut will go to space with NASA	Israel, despite being a small country, stands at the global forefront of the space field and serves as a significant factor in leading international space programs,' President Isaac Herzog said in a recorded video address from New York. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS Israel has reached an agreement with NASA to send the first Israeli woman astronaut into space, Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology Gila Gamliel said on Monday. The remarks come as Israel is expanding cooperation in space technology with longtime allies such as the U.S., Italy, and Azerbaijan, as well as with regional parties to the landmark 2020 Abraham Accords such as the United Arab Emirates. 'I received a confirmation from NASA to send the first Israeli woman astronaut into space,' Gamliel said at the 20th Ilan Ramon International Space Conference in Tel Aviv. 'We in Israel have now begun the process of searching for our candidate among our brave women.' The annual event—named after the first Israeli astronaut, Ilan Ramon, who died in the 2003 Columbia Space Shuttle disaster—promotes international collaboration and innovation in space exploration. This year’s conference was attended by Omran Sharaf, the UAE assistant foreign minister for advanced science and technology; and the president of the Italian Space Agency, Professor Teodoro Valente. Valente signed an accord with his Israeli counterpart, Uri Oron, to develop a payload for a mission to the moon. 'Our space cooperation is really improving,' the Italian Space Agency president told JNS. 'Just a few days ago our vice prime minister was here to support cooperation between our two countries—and space is one part of [that].' Heads of the Israeli and Italian space agencies, Uri Oron and Prof. Teodoro Valente, sign an MOU on the sidelines of the Ilan Ramon Conference. Jan. 27, 2025. Credit: Oz Shechter/GPO 'Israel, despite being a small country, stands at the global forefront of the space field and serves as a significant factor in leading international space programs,' President Isaac Herzog said in a recorded video address from New York, where he is attending the U.N. General Assembly’s event marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. 'We are already promoting cooperation with countries that have signed the Abraham Accords, and I am confident that in the near future we will see additional cooperation which will contribute to both Israel and the international space community,' Herzog said. Gamliel, who visited NASA’s Space Center in Houston in September, noted that nine nano-satellites built by Israeli high school students, including from a school along the Gaza border, will soon be sent into space aboard SpaceX rockets. The launch is slated to take place in March off the West Coast of the United States. 'We are building the future not just for ourselves, but for those who are no longer here,' said Or Ziner, a high school senior from southern Israel who headed the satellite project at her school, and who recounted growing up with rocket sirens warning of rockets from Gaza. 'My father’s mission was not just a historic one for Israel but for the entire Jewish community,' Ramon’s son Iftah said at the event. 'The mission, a mix of different countries and cultures, became a symbol of pride, hope and possibility.' 'Twenty years ago, we began a journey that would transform how the world sees Israel’s place in space exploration,' Gamliel said. 'By continuing to forge international partnerships and collaborations we aim to solidify Israel’s status as a global leader in the space industry while contributing to the advancement of global space exploration and innovation.'

Israel: Eight dead in Hamas list of 33 hostages to be freed	Defense Minister Israel Katz on Sunday reaffirmed Israel’s commitment to the truce and warned of severe consequences for violations. By JNS Eight of the 33 hostages intended for release during the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal are dead, according to a list provided by Hamas. Israeli government spokesman David Mencer confirmed that the terrorist group stated the remaining 25 hostages are alive. The list was delivered to Israel overnight on Sunday. After repeatedly violating the truce deal with Israel, Hamas is to release three additional captives on Thursday, the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem announced on Sunday night. The hostages to be released are civilian Arbel Yehud, IDF soldier Agam Berger and an unidentified man. Three more abductees are to be freed on Saturday, in accordance with the terms of the ceasefire. So far, seven hostages have been freed. However, 87 of the 251 individuals taken by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack remain in Gaza. This includes the remains of at least 34 hostages, confirmed dead by the Israel Defense Forces. Hamas is also holding two Israeli civilians who entered Gaza in 2014 and 2015, as well as the body of an IDF soldier killed in 2014. Another soldier’s remains were recovered earlier this month. Hamas failed to provide the list on Saturday, as required by the terms of the ceasefire, prompting Jerusalem to postpone the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza. On Monday, Palestinians began crossing on foot via a coastal road through the Netzarim Corridor south of Gaza City. Vehicle crossings via a parallel highway inland followed, leading to heavy traffic. While vehicles are subject to inspection under the ceasefire agreement, the details of the inspection process remain unclear. Defense Minister Israel Katz on Sunday reaffirmed Israel’s commitment to the truce and warned of severe consequences for violations, stating, 'We will not allow a return to the reality of October 7, [2023].' In the first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is to release 33 hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian terrorists, including many convicted of deadly attacks. So far, seven hostages have been released in exchange for more than 300 terrorists. The next two projected phases present greater challenges. Hamas has stated it will not release the remaining 60 hostages unless Israel ends the war, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains committed to dismantling Hamas and ending its 18-year rule over Gaza. The future of negotiations remains uncertain as both sides prepare for difficult talks.

Holocaust survivors make new lives in Israel despite war	Israel is home to 123,715 Holocaust survivors, according to the Holocaust Survivors’ Rights Authority. By Pesach Benson, TPS Since the outbreak of war on October 7, 2023, 68 Holocaust survivors have immigrated to Israel, with 50 arriving in 2024, the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration announced on Monday to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The oldest among these new arrivals is 98, while the youngest is 81. The majority of survivors came from Russia (36), followed by France (13), Ukraine (8), the United States (6), Germany (3), and Canada (2). Many chose to settle in the Mediterranean coastal cities of Netanya, Ashdod, Nahariya, Haifa, and Bat Yam, while others moved to locations such as Jerusalem, Karmiel, Beersheva, Ra’anana, Holon, and Rehovot. Said Immigratin and Absorption Minister Ofir Sofer welcomed the new immigrants, stating, 'We welcome everyone who chooses to immigrate to Israel with open arms. The data on immigrants over the past year show that many Jews have decided to immigrate now, including Holocaust survivors at an advanced age,' said Immigration and Absorption Minister Ofir Sofer. 'At the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration, we provide Holocaust survivors who immigrate with a full support package that includes eligibility for advancement in the waiting list for public housing, financial grants, assistance and additional benefits, which will allow them to live with dignity in the State of Israel,' Sofer added. Israel is home to 123,715 Holocaust survivors, according to the Holocaust Survivors’ Rights Authority. This figure represents a decline from 136,989 at the end of 2023, as over 13,000 survivors passed away during 2024. The average age of survivors is 88, with 257 individuals over the age of 100 still receiving welfare services. International Holocaust Remembrance Day commemorates the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland by Soviet soldiers in 1945.

‘An Insult’ – Holocaust museum chairman blasts Elon Musk’s addres...	Dani Dayan, chairman of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem and a former Israeli diplomat, blasts pro-Trump billionaire over video address to German nationalist party calling for rejection of war guilt, restoration of German national pride. By World Israel News Staff A former Israeli diplomat, who now heads the country's national Holocaust memorial museum, chastised billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk over a video statement made via satellite at an election event organized by a German nationalist party. On Saturday, Musk made a statement by video at an event in the eastern city of Halle, addressing the official launch of the right-wing AfD (Alternative For Germany) 2025 election campaign. During the event, Musk said it was time to embrace German national pride against multiculturalism, saying that today's Germans should not bear the guilty of their parents and grandparents for the legacy of the Holocaust. 'I think there is too much focus on past guilt,' Musk said, 'and we need to move beyond that. Children should not feel guilty for the sins of their parents - their great grandparents even.' A day later, Dani Dayan, the chairman of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Museum in Jerusalem and a former Israeli consul-general in New York who once served as chief of the Yesha Council - an umbrella group representing all Israeli towns in Judea and Samaria - condemned Musk's comments, calling them an 'insult' to Holocaust victims. 'Contrary to Elon Musk's advice,' tweeted Dayan, 'the remembrance and acknowledgement of the dark past of the country and its people should be central in shaping the German society.' 'Failing to do so is an insult to the victims of Nazism and a clear danger to the democratic future of Germany.' Musk's comments came just two days before International Holocaust Remembrance Day was observed on Monday.

Hamas rejects Gazan relocation plan, buts hints it may surrender ...	Senior Hamas officials blast proposal by President Donald Trump to relocate 1.5 million Gazans to Egypt or Jordan, while expressing openness to talks with the US to give up on post-war control over the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization on Sunday condemned plans by the Trump administration to relocate two-thirds of the population of the Gaza Strip to a third-party country, while expressing a willingness to enter into talks with the U.S. to discuss postwar arrangements for governing Gaza which do not include Hamas. On Sunday, Hamas' Sami Abu Zuhri lambasted Trump's proposal to relocate 1.5 million Gazans to a third-party country - possibly Jordan or Egypt - either temporarily or on a 'long-term' basis. Over the weekend, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he had spoken with Jordan's King Abdullah II, and that he was slated to speak with Egypt's president on the issue. Abu Zuhri rejected the proposal, saying that only the withdrawal of Israeli forces and end to the current war could address the lingering issues between Israel and the Gaza Strip. However, senior Hamas politburo member Moussa Abu Marzouk told the Saudi outlet Al Arabiya that the terror group may be willing to cede control of the Gaza Strip after the current war with Israel, adding that Hamas is willing to enter into talks with the U.S. with the aim of finding some arrangement for the coastal enclave's administration. Last year, AFP reported that Hamas and the Palestinian Authority's Fatah party had signed an outline for a deal, under which a non-partisan committee of 10-15 prominent Gazans would be established by Hamas and Fatah to govern Gaza after the current war. While Israel has said in the past it would not accept either Hamas control nor Palestinian Authority involvement in post-war Gaza, Abu Marzouk said the terror group is 'open to dialogue with all parties - besides Israel.' Abu Marzouk echoed Abu Zuhri's opposition to Trump's relocation plan, saying:'No Palestinian or Arab will accept Trump’s idea of displacement.' 'It will not succeed.'

‘Concrete warnings’ force Diaspora Minister to cancel trip to Bru...	Amichai Chikli said his physical safety was the concern, while an anti-Israel NGO claimed potential legal action against him had deterred the minister. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Minister for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli was forced to cancel his visit to the European Parliament to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day Monday due to concerns that were purposefully left vague. 'In light of concrete warnings, and in accordance with the guidance of security officials,' the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) announced Sunday night, the minister would not be flying to Brussels. The announcement is considered quite unusual, and no further information was forthcoming from the PMO. Chikli was scheduled to speak at a side event of the remembrance ceremony. European website Euronews reported that families of Hamas hostages and European Jewish leaders had protested to members of the Parliament as well as its president that the minister was not a 'worthy representative' as he opposed the current hostage deal. Chikli had said that his vote against the agreement was due to the sheer number of the Palestinian prisoners who were to be released in exchange, as well as the fact that so many were multiple murderers. 'Given the high rates of return to terrorism directly and indirectly (which stand at about 80%), this deal&#8230; could very likely be a death sentence for dozens if not hundreds of Israelis' in the future, he added. 'I also fear that given the threshold set at this stage, we will have difficulty realizing Phase 2, in which we will be required to pay higher prices for soldiers and men of fighting age.' Those opposing his presence also wrote of Chikli’s ostensible 'extreme and polarizing positions' in supporting far-right politicians in Europe whose parties have had a history of antisemitism but are currently supportive of Israel, recognizing the threat of Muslim extremism in their own countries. The minister’s participation 'could overshadow the vital message of the conference and undermine the credibility of the European Parliament's efforts to combat antisemitism and hatred,' they wrote. Chikli claimed that the directive not to go was given by the National Security Council and had to do with his physical security. 'I regretted receiving an instruction this evening from security officials to cancel my participation in the International Holocaust Remembrance Day events in the European Parliament,' he said. 'Unfortunately, the capital of Europe, Brussels, has become an unsafe place for Jews and Israelis.' By contrast, the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), which has filed criminal complaints in many countries against IDF soldiers for war crimes they allegedly committed in Gaza, claimed Chikli’s cancellation as their victory. 'The minister who threatened HRF chairman Dyab Aboujahjah canceled a visit to Brussels, citing 'security concerns,'' the group posted to X. 'We are convinced that this decision has more to do with avoiding justice and legal action.' Earlier this month, Chikli had written on X in reply to a post by the chairman, 'Hello to our human rights activist. Keep an eye on your pager,' referring to Israel’s successful attack in September on a few thousand Hezbollah terrorists by detonating beepers that had been booby-trapped then sold to the terror organization by third parties. The Belgian-Lebanese Aboujahjah claimed that the poke was an 'open threat' that was 'a blatant act of terrorism and incitement' and that he would be filing a lawsuit against the minister.

Irish president bashes Israel at Holocaust memorial event	Ireland's Michael Higgins 'resorted to cheap and despicable provocation,' said Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar blasted the Irish president Sunday after he took the opportunity of speaking at a Holocaust memorial event to bash Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 'Even on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Irish President Michael Higgins failed to rise above himself and resorted to cheap and despicable provocation,' the foreign minister said. 'What a despicable person,' Saar added. 'What a twisted policy.' After speaking about the importance of Holocaust education so as to prevent another such genocide, Higgins segued into remarks about the war. He gave a nod to the 'the horrific acts of October 7' but immediately added 'and its response.' He then referred only to Israel’s actions without naming Hamas as the perpetrators of the massacre that caused the war, or mentioning that had Hamas released the hostages the war could have ended months ago. He spoke of 'the loss of civilian lives, the majority women and children,' which, as Saar pointed out, was a parroting of Hamas propaganda points, as the ratio of noncombatants to combatants' deaths has been two to one in the war, an unprecedently low number. He also talked about the 'horrific destruction' of homes and 'necessary institutions' in Gaza, as if Israel had no reason for demolishing them when the IDF has proven repeatedly that Hamas has used homes, schools and hospitals as military sites, in breach of international law. Several members of the audience, including Holocaust survivors, stood up and turned their backs on him. Some were asked to leave by security guards, and a few were forcibly removed when they refused. Lior Tibet, an Israeli who teaches the Holocaust at University College Dublin, was one of them, and said she was shocked at the woman’s request. 'I asked her, ‘How can you take a Jewish person out of this commemoration event? I didn’t do anything wrong.’ This was the only way I could protest about it,' she told The Irish Times. 'The last 15 months have been unbearable here,' she added, referring to the Israel-Hamas war. 'We feel like we are talking to the walls when we talk about antisemitism. It is really disheartening to us to see no one gives us a voice.' Several more people demonstrably walked out of the hall in solidarity with those who had been removed. In all, some 20 out of the audience of 500 left the speech and were not allowed back in. Higgins is known for his anti-Israel stance, and he was asked by several prominent leaders of the Jewish community not to speak at the event since they felt his presence would be inappropriate, but he came anyway. The Irish government in general is one of Israel’s sharpest critics in Europe, and it reached the point in December that Saar closed the Israeli embassy in Dublin. 'The actions and antisemitic rhetoric used by Ireland against Israel are rooted in the delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state, along with double standards. Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel,' the foreign ministry said in an explanatory statement.

Trump slaps tariffs on Colombia after its Israel-bashing Marxist ...	The fresh sanctions also suggest that Trump, unlike the Biden White House, is ready to confront a host of far-left Latin American governments that have stoked anti-American and anti-Western fervor for years. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon President Donald Trump announced sweeping punitive measures against Colombia on Sunday after its Marxist president, Gustavo Petro, denied entry to two U.S. military deportation planes filled with migrants. Trump in turn imposed an 'emergency' 25 percent tariff on Colombian goods—and it took Petro less than an hour to offer his presidential plane to pick up the migrants. Other measures include a travel ban on Colombian government officials and their 'allies and supporters,' as well as visa sanctions on 'all Party Members, Family Members, and Supporters of the Colombia government' Trump announced in a statement. 'These measures are just the beginning,' Trump said. 'We will not allow the Colombia Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!' Petro made amends to receive the migrants shortly thereafter, announcing in a statement that he would send his presidential plane. 'The Government of Colombia, under the leadership of President Gustavo Petro, has arranged for the presidential plane to facilitate the dignified return of Colombian nationals who were to arrive in the country today in the morning hours, coming from deportation flights,' the statement said. The ordeal comes as an early diplomatic standoff stemming from the mass deportations Trump campaigned on. In his first week back in the White House, Trump began military deportation flights to Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico. He also sent 1,500 active-duty troops to the southern border, with additional deployments set to follow, and launched illegal immigration raids in major cities across the country. A majority of U.S. adults, 55 percent, support Trump's mass deportations, according to a New York Times poll conducted shortly before Trump's inauguration. The situation began earlier on Sunday when Petro, a former member of the Marxist M-19 guerilla group, prevented two American military planes from landing in his country. The planes were carrying around 80 Colombian migrants who were deported under Trump’s tough new border policies. Mexico similarly blocked a U.S. deportation plane from taking off last week, but the Trump administration resolved the situation, and Mexico accepted four deportation flights on Thursday. Petro’s decision to block the planes serves as an early test for the Trump administration as it seeks to seal up America’s porous southern border and deport scores of illegals, many of whom are convicted violent criminals. The fresh sanctions also suggest that Trump, unlike the Biden White House, is ready to confront a host of far-left Latin American governments that have stoked anti-American and anti-Western fervor for years. In Colombia's case, Petro has established himself as a fierce opponent of Israel’s government, accusing it of 'genocide' and severing diplomatic ties after Hamas’s Oct. 7 terror spree. While the Colombian deportation flights were initially cleared for landing, Petro revoked their diplomatic clearances at the last moment, according to NBC News. 'The US cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals,' Petro said in a Spanish-language message on X. I deny the entry of American planes carrying Colombian migrants into our territory. The United States must establish a protocol for the dignified treatment of migrants before we receive them.' Trump, in turn, took aim at Petro, calling him a 'socialist' who 'is already very unpopular amongst his people.' Donald Trump's statement on Colombian president Gustavo Petro. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that, under Trump, 'America will no longer be lied to nor taken advantage of.' 'It is the responsibility of each nation to take back their citizens who are illegally present in the United States in a serious and expeditious manner,' Rubio said in a statement provided to the Washington Free Beacon. 'Colombian President Petro had authorized flights and provided all needed authorizations and then canceled his authorization when the planes were in the air.' 'As demonstrated by today’s actions, we are unwavering in our commitment to end illegal immigration and bolster America’s border security.' Petro spent his youth as a member of Colombia’s far-left M-19 militant group, which sought to violently topple the government. In 1985, the group stormed Colombia’s national judicial building, sparking a clash that killed 94 people and that is remembered as 'one of the bloodiest acts in the country’s recent history,' according to the New York Times. Petro was also known as a close adviser to Venezuela’s former anti-American president, Hugo Chavez. As Colombia's president, Petro modeled himself as a socialist revolutionary, finding common cause with the Hamas terrorist group after its shocking terror attack on Israel. Some of his comments around the Middle East war drew accusations of anti-Semitism from Jewish advocacy groups. In September, roughly one year after Hamas’s attack, Petro accused the global media of covering up alleged Israeli crimes, likening them to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. 'Anyone who defends this genocide or remains silent in the face of it has destroyed their own human condition,' Petro said at the time. 'It would seem as if Goebbels is the one who directs the world's communications so that tens of thousands of journalists are silenced in the face of their murdered colleagues and 20,000 babies torn to pieces by bombs.' Rep. Brian Mast (R., Fla.) said Trump's actions to confront Petro show 'the rule of law and the law of the jungle have returned.' 'We don't allow our people to cross Colombia's borders illegally, they shouldn't allow theirs to cross ours illegally,' he told the Free Beacon. 'If they do, they should work with us to clean up the mess.'

We want to say thank you to all who were with us all this time. We continue to pray for everybody,' said Orly Gilboa mother of returned hostage Daniella. By Crystal Jones, TPS Relatives of Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag, expressed their happiness that the women are now home with them at an emotional Sunday night meeting with reporters at the Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva. At the same time, they continued to emphasize that the 'fight is not over'' until all the hostages in Gaza are brought back. Yoni Levy, the father of Naama Levy, said: 'This is the moment I prayed for for 477 days. On October 7th, we returned to be the family of Naama Levy. 'The soldiers turned to be the symbol of the voice that was not heard. I’m sure these events will be investigated,' he said. 'Naama is safe with us, but the fight is not over. The hostages are still there. They are our daughters and sons. All of the country wants the hostages at home. Please continue to fight until the last hostage gets back home.' Daniella’s mother Orly said: 'Daniella is at home. How long I waited to say these words. My daughter is pale, she suffered, but she remained the same Daniella. She also kept her Israeli spirit.' Orly noted that the family added an extra letter to their daughter’s name in line with Jewish belief that this can be a source of spiritual protection. 'She was kidnapped as Danielle, we added the last letter to her name after she was kidnapped. She learned about this while in Gaza.' She continued: 'We won’t stop until Agam returns home too, and all other hostages. I ask that the deal will be completed. 'Our family, the family of the hostages, need to see all of them returning home. We want to say thank you to all who were with us all this time. We continue to pray for everybody.' In English, she added:'Thank you President Trump for everything you’re doing for the hostages. If anyone can bring world peace, its definitely you. 'We are confident you will do whatever it takes to get us there.' Liri’s father, Eli Albag told journalists: 'Liri is back. But there are 90 hostages. The Bibas family, Agam Berger, Arbel Yehud – were meant to be released. I want to say thank you to the state of Israel that hostages have begun to return. 'Those in the government who opposed the deal – the people will settle the account with you. The PM took a brave step. 'For the families who lost their loved ones – we’ll never forget you. My heart is broken, and on the day I need to be happy, I am not. My soul is with these soldiers who fell in battle. 'Thank you to president Trump and Biden. Thank you to everybody, to the people of Israel.' Karina Ariev’s sister Shasha told press: 'We are here tonight, first to say thank you to all of you. A huge thanks goes to the soldiers, who are on the frontline day and night, protecting all of us… 'At the same time, we cannot forget the young brave souls lost…You were there for her and we don’t take that for granted.' She went on to urge the campaign to bring the rets of the hostages home as she continued: 'Karina knows exactly what that feels like [to be a Hamas hostage] and she can’t stop thinking about all of them. 'Like all of us, she hopes and prays they will return home. We will not rest until they are all back home with us.' The four released women, all aged between 19 and 20, were freed on Saturday as Israel freed 200 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists. The first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how many are alive. So far, seven Israelis have been released. The fate of the remaining 65 hostages will be determined by negotiations to begin on the 16th day of the ceasefire. Critics say the phased approach condemns hostages not freed in the beginning to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 90 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead.

Israel bans plane landings at Paphos, Cyprus fearing security con...	The Israeli government currently does not advise against traveling to Paphos, and the decision to prohibit Israeli carriers from landing there reportedly stems from security considerations related to the airport. By JNS The Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) banned Israeli airlines on Monday from landing at Paphos International Airport in southwestern Cyprus due to unspecified security concerns, according to Hebrew media reports. The ISA ordered Israeli airlines El Al, Arkia and Israir to 'concentrate flights to and from Cyprus at Larnaca Airport based on various security considerations,' according to a statement cited by Ynet. The ISA directive would remain in place for the entire month of January but could possibly be extended, according to Mako, a Channel 12 News outlet. El Al had already redirected its Cyprus flights to Larnaca for several days, informing its passengers in announcements before takeoff and offering them transportation by bus to Paphos, according to the report. The Israeli government currently does not advise against traveling to Paphos, and the decision to prohibit Israeli carriers from landing there reportedly stems from security considerations related to the airport. Israel’s National Security Council has said that since the start of the war against Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, many Israelis have temporarily relocated to Cyprus, raising concerns about Iranian terror activity there. In June, Hezbollah terror leader Hassan Nasrallah threatened that Cyprus would be considered 'a part of the war' if Nicosia continued to allow Jerusalem to use its airports and bases for military exercises.

IDF reservist soldiers outed as Iranian spies	Israeli authorities arrest two IDF reserve soldiers suspected of spying for Iran, transferring classified military documents to their Iranian handlers. By World Israel News Staff Two Israeli reserve soldiers were arrested recently, after they allegedly were recruited as spies on behalf of Iran, authorities announced Monday. In a joint statement released by Israel Police's Lahav 433 unit and the Shin Bet internal security Agency Monday morning, authorities revealed that two reservists from the Haifa district were arrested earlier this month on suspicion of espionage and committing acts of vandalism on behalf of Iranian intelligence agencies. The suspects were identified in a preliminary indictment filed Monday morning as Yuri Eliaspov and Georgi Andreyev. The full indictment is expected to be filed in the next few days. Investigators claim Eliaspov had been in contact with an Iranian operative for several months and carried out security-related missions under his direction in exchange for financial compensation. These missions included spraying graffiti with the phrase 'Children of Ruhollah' in various locations across the country, as well as transferring classified material he obtained during his military service in the Air Defense Division to his handler. The investigation also found that Eliaspov suggested to his friend, Andreyev, that he, too, establish contact with the Iranian handler to carry out missions for financial compensation, despite knowing that the handler was an Iranian agent. Georgi agreed to Yuri's proposal and began communicating with the Iranian handler, carrying out missions such as graffiti spraying and assisting Eliaspov with hanging a sign under the handler’s instructions. Authorities say the two suspects were aware they were being directed by an Iranian agent, partly based on media reports they had seen at the time about the arrest and interrogation of Israeli citizens who had been in contact with Iranian intelligence and carried out similar missions. The investigation also revealed that Iranian operatives are attempting to recruit Israelis through social media platforms.

Hebrew University offers full scholarship to freed hostages	The program is designed to serve as a cornerstone for these individuals’ return to normalcy, equipping them with the tools to achieve their personal and professional aspirations. By JNS The Hebrew University of Jerusalem is offering full scholarships in any field of study to all released hostages, the school announced on Sunday. The university is offering full scholarships for a three-year academic degree—covering both bachelor’s and master’s programs—to all captives freed from Gaza, along with a dedicated fund to ensure children who were held hostage can access higher education in the future. A bachelor’s degree in Israel normally requires three years of full-time study. The initiative includes personalized academic guidance, psychological support, and career counseling, aiming to provide a foundation for their recovery and reintegration. The program is designed to serve as a cornerstone for these individuals’ return to normalcy, equipping them with the tools to achieve their personal and professional aspirations. 'We are committed to standing by all who experienced the horrors of October 7 and the prolonged captivity under Hamas. It is our responsibility to support them in every way possible,' said Professor Tamir Sheafer, rector of the Hebrew University. 'We aim to help them rebuild a hopeful future and provide a solid anchor in their long rehabilitation journey. As Israel’s leading academic institution, we believe in the transformative power of higher education and its potential to drive personal and societal change. This initiative reflects our deep ethical and social commitment,' Sheafer said.

Ex-minister slams Israel’s ‘total surrender’ as Palestinians floo...	After deal reached to secure release of hostage Arbel Yehoud, IDF opens up Netzarim Corridor to Gazans, leading to mass migration northward - including openly armed terrorists flouting ceasefire. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Thousands of Gazans surged north through the Netzarim Corridor Monday morning, after Israeli forces lifted the travel ban on the strategic are bisecting the Gaza Strip. After reaching an agreement overnight with the Hamas terror organization securing the release of hostage Arbel Yehoud and two other civilian captives for this Thursday, Israel pulled back IDF forces from parts of the Netzarim Corridor - which separates northern Gaza from the rest of the Gaza Strip - allowing Gazans traveling by foot to move northward, back to population centers including Gaza City, Jabalya, and Beit Hanoun. Beginning at 7:00 a.m., masses of Gazans began moving through the corridor, Arabic media outlets reported. The Hamas-run Gaza interior ministry confirmed to AFP that the corridor had been opened to pedestrian traffic. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal completed earlier this month, civilians are permitted to move from southern Gaza into the northern Strip by foot. While the ceasefire deal bans the carrying of any weapons through the Netzarim Corridor, no enforcement mechanism was put in place. Images from the corridor Monday morning revealed numerous terrorists openly brandishing firearms as they moved northward. Former National Security Minister MK Itamar Ben-Gvir, whose Otzma Yehudit faction bolted the government last week in protest of the ceasefire deal, castigated the return of Gazans to the northern Strip. 'The opening of the Nitzanim crossing this morning and the entry of tens of thousands of Gazans into the northern part of the Strip are Hamas' victory images and another humiliating part of this reckless deal,' Ben-Gvir tweeted. 'This does not look like a 'decisive victory' – this looks like total surrender. The heroic IDF soldiers did not fight and sacrifice their lives in the Strip to enable these images. We must return to the war – and destroy!' Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) tweeted shortly after the opening of the Netzarim Corridor that the IDF will 'vigorously enforce' the ceasefire in northern Gaza. 'We will continue to vigorously enforce the ceasefires in the north and the south. Anyone who violates the rules or threatens IDF forces - will bear the full price. We will not allow a return to the reality of October 7th.'

Lebanese military accused of leaking secrets to Hezbollah	Israel-Lebanon ceasefire jeopardized after senior Lebanese army intelligence official reportedly handed over classified information from US, French peacekeeping committee to Hezbollah terror organization. By World Israel News Staff A senior Lebanese army official leaked military secrets from a joint American-French peacekeeping mission to the Hezbollah terror organization, according to a report by Britain's The Times on Sunday. As part of the ceasefire deal between Israel, Lebanon, and Hezbollah, signed in late November, 2024, the U.S. and France formed a joint observer mission with the United Nations to ensure the implementation of the ceasefire deal, and to investigate claims of violations. Citing unnamed intelligence sources, Sunday's report claimed that Suhil Bahij Gharb, the chief of the Lebanese army's intel division for southern Lebanon handed Hezbollah a dossier taken from the security control room of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) used by France and the U.S. to monitor the ongoing ceasefire. The incident was reported just hours after the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon was originally slated to be completed. Israel delayed the pullout, however, citing both Hezbollah's continued presence south of the Litani River - in violation of the ceasefire deal - and the failure of the Lebanese army to assume security control over areas ostensibly under control by the government in Beirut. Later on Sunday, the White House confirmed that the withdrawal has been delayed, setting a new deadline of February 18th. At least 22 people were killed during clashes between Lebanese rioters and Israeli troops across southern Lebanon Sunday, as thousands of civilians and soldiers approached towns still under Israeli security control. Many of the rioters waved Hezbollah flags, leading to accusations that the confrontations were instigated by the terror group. According to Sunday's report, Gharb - a member of Lebanon's Shi'ite minority - is not the only senior Lebanese army official to leak security information to Hezbollah - dozens of other officers reportedly handed over sensitive material to the pro-Iranian terror group, giving Hezbollah advanced knowledge of impending raids, enabling its operatives to move weapons caches. 'Hezbollah use internal, sensitive information regarding the Lebanese army to hide its actions from the international entities in charge of regional security,' a security document cited by Sunday's report claims. 'More than one member of the Lebanese army is leaking information to Hezbollah,' Hilal Khashan, a political science professor at the American University of Beirut said. 'The fact that the top echelon of the military maintains close ties with the US does not prevent co-operation between army officers, even on an individual basis, with Hezbollah.' The Lebanese military and UNIFIL both declined to comment on the report.

Iranian cyberattack terrorizes Israeli daycares	Iranian hackers infiltrate panic buttons in daycare centers, playing pro-terror messages and air raid sirens. By World Israel News Staff Iranian hackers attacked an Israeli company that provides panic buttons in daycare facilities, maliciously sounding alarms in childcare centers, as well as playing threatening messages in Arabic and songs glorifying terrorism. The pro-Palestinian Handala hacking group, which is believed to be composed of Iranian actors, has carried out numerous attacks on Israeli targets in recent years. On Sunday, Handala infiltrated Magar-Tech, an Israeli business that installs panic buttons in childcare facilities, which can be used to summon emergency services. After hacking Magar-Tech, the group sounded air raid sirens via the buttons, as well as Arabic-language pro-terror songs and messages. According to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Ynet, the hack affected approximately 20 daycare centers in Israel. Leveraging a list of customer names and phone numbers with Magar-Tech's internal systems, Handala then sent threatening text messages to some 10,000 Israelis. In a statement, the National Cyber ​​Directorate recommends that municipal administrators using Magar-Tech's panic buttons advise daycare facilities to disconnect from the system for several days, as well as change their passwords. The Iranian attack group claims that beyond terrorizing childcare centers, it also successfully hacked into the National Security Ministry's internal systems. On their Telegram channels, the group posted screenshots depicting stolen files that were said to contain personal information about police officers. Handala said it had obtained the personal details of those who hold firearms, along with information about vehicles belonging to municipal police forces. In March 2022, an Iranian hacking group published personal documents belonging to Mossad chief David Barnea. The materials included his Israeli identification card, flight tickets, and tax documents, along with purported satellite images of his home and a clip of him making silly faces during a personal video chat. A tax document included in the leak was addressed to Barnea’s wife, indicating that she owed a five-figure sum to the Israeli tax authorities.

‘Clearly terror’ – IDF soldier nearly stabbed in Beersheba attack	His entire body is covered in bruises, and he has numerous cuts, including to his clothing, from the knife attack,' says soldier's family. By World Israel News Staff The family of an Israeli soldier attacked by Arabs is speaking out, claiming that the police are downplaying the seriousness of the incident. Nathan, 21, whose last name was withheld in Hebrew-language media reports, required medical attention after being beaten by two Arab men last week in the southern city of Beersheba. The soldier's family told Hebrew-language outlet Walla that Nathan works as a courier for a food delivery service during his time off from the army. He was wearing his IDF uniform, en route to a customer, when suddenly a car attempted to run his motorcycle off the road. 'Two Arab guys approached him in a white Hyundai and started shouting at him - 'Soldier, are you cold?' 'Oh, you dog,'' his parents told Walla. The men drove dangerously close to Nathan's motorcycle, forcing Nathan to pull over on the side of the road. The men then exited the vehicle and began beating him. According to his parents, Nathan saw one of the men retrieve a knife from his pocket, so he put on his helmet in the hopes it would protect him. The perpetrators 'were trying to stab him, but he pushed them away,' his parents said. 'His entire body is covered in bruises, and he has numerous cuts, including to his clothing, from the knife attack.' A video provided by the family to Walla showed Nathan's military jacket damaged by several deep slashes. After others attempted to intervene and the police were called, the attackers fled. According to Nathan's family, the police are categorizing the attack as a 'road rage' incident. 'It is clear to all of us that this is nationalistic incident,' his family said, using a common Hebrew term to describe politically motivated terror attacks by Arabs against Israelis. 'Today he was the victim, but tomorrow it could be another soldier.'

Hamas to release three hostages Thursday, provides list of live a...	An Israeli diplomatic source verified that Hamas had provided details about the hostages included in the first phase of the deal, including who is alive and who is deceased. By World Israel News staff Hamas is set to release three hostages—Arbel Yehoud, Agam Berger, and an additional male—on Thursday, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) confirmed following an announcement by Qatar's Foreign Ministry on Sunday. The Qatari ministry also noted that Hamas plans to release three more hostages on Saturday as part of the ongoing ceasefire agreement. According to the PMO, mediators have received the full list of hostages slated for release during the initial phase of the agreement. This list was initially expected last week. In exchange, Qatar's Foreign Ministry announced that Israel will permit displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza starting Monday morning. Discussions surrounding the timing of Arbel Yehoud’s release had been central to negotiations about allowing Gaza residents to return to the northern Strip via the Netzarim Corridor. Negotiators had debated whether to permit the return of residents immediately after Arbel’s release or upon the agreement for her release. Sources from the negotiations told Israel’s public broadcaster, KAN, that Palestinian Islamic Jihad dropped its demand to label Yehoud as a member of the security forces, agreeing instead to recognize her as a civilian. Arab media reports indicatded that Yehoud could be released as early as Tuesday or Wednesday. Qatar previously announced that Yehoud and two others would be released before Friday, linked to Israel's decision to open the Netzarim Corridor. However, earlier reports revealed complications when Islamic Jihad’s leader, Ziyad al-Nakhaleh, objected to Yehoud’s release without a higher price—such as the release of prisoners serving life sentences—due to claims about her security background. An Israeli diplomatic source verified that Hamas had provided details about the hostages included in the first phase of the deal, including who is alive and who is deceased. The Prime Minister emphasized Israel's commitment to securing the return of all hostages and maintaining the ceasefire agreement's terms.

IDF will not withdraw from Lebanon, truce extended by three weeks	Israel's withdrawal process is conditional on the Lebanese Army deploying in Southern Lebanon and fully enforcing the agreement, while Hezbollah withdraws beyond the Litani. By JNS The U.S.-monitored arrangement between Lebanon and Israel will carry on until Feb. 18, the White House stated on Sunday evening—the day the prior agreement, struck on Nov. 26, was slated to end. 'The government of Lebanon, the government of Israel and the government of the United States will also begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after Oct. 7, 2023,' the White House stated. Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council of the White House, said on Friday that a 'short, temporary ceasefire extension' was 'urgently needed.' U.S. President Donald Trump 'is committed to ensuring Israeli citizens can safely return to their homes in northern Israel,' while also supporting Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and the new Lebanese government, Hughes stated. Israel announced on Friday that it would not withdraw all of its forces from Southern Lebanon by Sunday. Hezbollah warned that it would consider the truce terminated, and the Lebanese government urged the Trump administration to intervene. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office stated on Friday that the Israeli military’s 'withdrawal process is conditional on the Lebanese Army deploying in Southern Lebanon and fully and effectively enforcing the agreement, while Hezbollah withdraws beyond the Litani,' the river in the southern part of the country. 'Since the ceasefire agreement has not yet been fully enforced by the State of Lebanon, the phased withdrawal process will continue, in full coordination with the United States,' the Israeli government said. Israel 'will not endanger its communities and citizens and will insist on the full implementation of the objective of the fighting in the north, which is the safe return of residents to their homes,' it added. The 60-day ceasefire went into effect on Nov. 27 and was slated to expire on Sunday. Hostilities began on Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel in solidarity, it said, with Hamas in Gaza. In a deliberation held at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee three weeks ago, Maj. Gen. Uri Gordin, the head of the Israeli Defense Forces Northern Command, said that Hezbollah has committed hundreds of violations of the ceasefire terms, Israel’s public broadcaster Kan News reported recently. Gordin added that the Lebanese Armed Forces are aiding the Shi’ite terrorist organization in locations where the Lebanese army is manned by Shi’ite commanders and companies. The IDF did not comment on the report.

Conflicting reports on possible release of hostage Arbel Yehud	Although Arab sources indicate Arbel Yehud will be released later in the week, Israeli sources say no agreement has been reached yet. By JNS Arbel Yehud, 29, an Israeli civilian held in the Gaza Strip who was expected to be freed on Sunday according to the ceasefire agreement with Hamas, may be released later this week. Various Arab media reports, citing either Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad sources, said Yehud will be released on or before Saturday. Sky News Arabia reported that Yehud would be released in exchange for 30 terrorists held by Israel and the return of Arabs to the northern Gaza Strip. However, Israel Hayom, citing an Israeli source familiar with the matter, said that contrary to reports, an agreement hasn’t been reached on the release of Yehud, and contacts with mediators continue. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal, Hamas was supposed to free female civilian hostages before female soldiers. Instead, Hamas released four female IDF soldiers on Saturday: Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said that it would not allow Gazan residents to return to the north of the Gaza Strip until Yehud is free. On Sunday, thousands of Gazans were waiting on the main roads leading north. Yehud is reportedly being held by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist group. PIJ has falsely classified Yehud as an IDF soldier, according to reports. Yehud was taken hostage with her boyfriend, Ariel Cunio, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023, the day of the Hamas-led invasion. Ariel Cunio, 27, is presumed to be alive but is not listed among those to be released in the first phase of the agreement. The only men expected to be freed in the first phase are those ill, wounded or aged 50 and above. Ariel’s brother David, 34, was also kidnapped by Hamas, together with his wife, Sharon, and their 3-year-old twins. Sharon and the children were released during the first ceasefire on Nov. 27, 2023. Shiri Bibas, 33, another female civilian hostage, and her two young sons are on the list of the 33 hostages to be released now. Hamas, however, claimed in November that they were killed. Three civilian women—Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher—were released last Sunday in return for 90 terrorists (30 for each civilian) shortly after the ceasefire went into effect.

Hamas altered appearance of hostages before they were released – ...	The terror group used 'accelerated rehabilitation' methods on them to create the impression they had been treated better than they actually were. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas reportedly altered the appearance of hostages before their release, according to a report by N12. Although the hostages reported receiving very little food and water during their 477 days of captivity, they appeared alert and well. This was because the terror group used 'accelerated rehabilitation' methods on them to create the impression they had been treated better than they actually were. These methods included providing the soon-to-be-released hostages with nutritious food and stimulants before handing them over to the Red Cross. This practice came to light through the accounts of the hostages upon their return to Israel. On Saturday, Karina Ariev, Liri Albag, Daniella Gilboa, and Naama Levy were released from Hamas captivity. Hostages released last week, including Emily Damari, Romi Gonen, and Doron Steinbrecher, were taken to Sheba Medical Center after a week of medical checks and treatment. Some family members commented that their loved ones looked better than expected, but the testimonies of the hostages tell a different story. According to their reports, the hostages were forced to drink seawater and were given only bread and rice to eat. The four women released on Saturday explained that early in their captivity, they were cared for by an elderly hostage who ensured they could shower and had food. The hostages said they were forced to cook and clean for Gazan families and to look after their children. They revealed that the elderly hostage was later killed in Gaza. The released hostages said they were moved frequently and kept in civilian homes and Gaza tunnels, often in unsanitary conditions. Their Hamas captors also moved them around Gaza City and disguised them as Arab women. The freed hostages said they appeared on Arab media, including Al Jazeera, and learned about the hostage releases in November. One of them mentioned hearing her family send birthday greetings on the radio. They said their Hamas captors told them about events of the war in Gaza, including the collapse of a building in December that killed 21 soldiers. The hostages reported that their captors often treated them with contempt, mockingly referring to them as 'the soldiers.'

Released prisoner who assaulted female guard threatened to ‘haunt...	He knows a lot of personal details about me – who my parents are, where I live, that my fiancé is an IDF soldier in Nablus.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A terrorist released in exchange for Israeli hostages threatened to 'haunt' the female guard he raped for the rest of her life. A former female guard at Gilboa prison described her trauma at hearing that terrorist Muhammad Attallah, who was imprisoned for murder before raping her and other female guards, would be released. She told Reshet Bet Radio that she had voiced her objection to his release and had mentioned that he had her personal information and had threatened to pursue her. 'He knows a lot of personal details about me – who my parents are, where I live, that my fiancé is an IDF soldier in Nablus. He’s convinced that my child is actually his,' she said. 'I’m warning about this before anything happens. He’s threatened to haunt me for the rest of my life and said he would take me to Nablus. I’ve already sacrificed too much, too many times,' she added. The former guard said the prison service did nothing to prepare her for his release and that she has been suffering a 'regression' in her recovery from the assault. She compared her unheeded warnings to the lack of attention the female lookouts received when they warned that Hamas was training for an invasion. 'I warned the authorities before the rape. I said to the intelligence officer and my commanders, ‘He's strange. He talks to me about things he's not supposed to.'' Last week, female guards at Gilboa Prison appealed to the Supreme Court that a prisoner who raped them be released abroad and not within Israel. In their appeal, the guards said that the decision to release Atallah within Israel did not take into account the fact that he was a danger to others as well as to the guards themselves. The attorney for the women said, 'Exiling the terrorist to Nablus poses a direct and immediate threat to the safety of the female guards. It appears those within the defense echelon view abandoning female guards—essentially IDF soldiers—as an acceptable course of action. We urge the Supreme Court to intervene and insist that the terrorist be sent abroad, in order to ensure the safety of the guards’ lives.'

Katz hints to US Secretary of Defense Hegseth about military acti...	On January 10, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led a discussion to assess the Israeli military's readiness for a potential third strike on Iran. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a letter congratulating the new U.S. Secretary of Defense, Peter Hegseth, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz hinted at potential military action against Iran 'in the upcoming months.' Katz wrote, 'The upcoming months present us with challenges that require military readiness and opportunities that allow us to further our strategic goals. I am confident that together we can succeed, creating long-term stability and a better future for the region.' Katz also recently remarked that Israel is at a high level of preparedness to strike Iranian military targets, particularly its nuclear facilities—an assessment echoed by U.S. officials. He continued, 'The defense alliance between our nations is marked by shared goals and values of peace, security, and prosperity. The longstanding commitment and support of the United States to Israel’s security and its qualitative military edge is of great value.' Katz and others observed that Israel's counterattack against Iran on October 26 revealed the vulnerability of Iran's strategic sites and demonstrated the precision of the Israeli Air Force in hitting sensitive targets. On January 10, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led a discussion to assess the Israeli military's readiness for a potential third strike on Iran. The meeting also addressed the anticipated shift toward a tougher U.S. policy on Iran under the incoming Trump administration. After meeting with Donald Trump on November 10, Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer reportedly came away with the impression that the president-elect would support an Israeli Air Force strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities or potentially authorize a U.S. strike, according to Axios, citing unnamed sources. When asked by reporters after the meeting about the possibility of a U.S. strike on Iran, Trump responded, 'It’s a military strategy, and I’m not answering a question on our military strategy. Only a stupid person would answer.'

Defense minister to begin interviewing candidates for next Israel...	The last time an IDF chief of staff resigned before the end of his term was Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz, who resigned in 2007 over IDF failures during the Second Lebanon War of 2006. By Pesach Benson, TPS Defense Minister Yisrael Katz announced on Sunday he will begin interviewing candidates to replace Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi as Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces. Katz said he will interview Maj.-Gen. Amir Baram who is Deputy Chief of Staff; Maj.-Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, who is the Defense Ministry’s Director General; and Maj.-Gen. Tamir Yadai, former chief of ground forces. Halevi and Maj.-Gen. Yaron Finkelman, commander of the Southern Command, who was responsible for military readiness and activities in southern Israel and along the Gaza border announced their resignations on Tuesday. The last time an IDF chief of staff resigned before the end of his term was Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz, who resigned in 2007 over IDF failures during the Second Lebanon War of 2006. Halevi previously signaled he would offer his resignation around the end of January when the army’s internal inquiries into October 7 are submitted to Defense Minister Israel Katz. Katz refuses to sign off on promotions of officers to the ranks of major general or give generals new roles until he reviews the army’s findings. There have been growing calls for the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to investigate political and military failures. Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. They may include personal recommendations about individuals under investigation, though the government is not bound to act on the recommendations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the governing coalition say an independent commission should only be appointed after the war. The last state commission of inquiry, which investigated Israel’s worst civilian disaster — a stampede that killed 45 people at a holy site on Mount Meron — held Netanyahu personally responsible for the tragedy in a report released in April.

Ministers back bill letting Jews buy land in Judea and Samaria	Residents of Judea and Samaria have circumvented the law until now by opening companies with the Civil Administration and purchasing land through those companies. By JNS Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday approved government backing for a Knesset bill that would allow Jews to directly purchase land in Judea and Samaria without going through the Civil Administration. Hebrew media is characterizing it as a step on the way to the annexation of Judea and Samaria. Until now, only citizens of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan could purchase land directly in Judea and Samaria. Jordan, which occupied Judea and Samaria between 1948 and 1967, had applied to the region the 'The law on renting and selling immovable property to Foreigners,' aka the 'Jordanian Law.' It prohibits the purchase of land in Judea and Samaria by foreigners who do not have Jordanian citizenship. Israel has not annexed Judea and Samaria, instead setting up a body called the Civil Administration in 1981 to replace the military government that ruled there since Israel liberated the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War. The Civil Administration has maintained a combination of Ottoman, Jordanian and British Mandate laws in the region. The bill would repeal the 'Jordanian Law.' The new legislation states, 'This reality, which sets limits on the right of a citizen of the State of Israel to acquire rights in real estate in the Judea and Samaria region only because of being an Israeli citizen, is unacceptable. 'Therefore, it is proposed to establish in primary legislation that every person will be allowed to acquire rights in real estate in the Judea and Samaria region, as in any other place,' it said. Previous Israeli efforts to cancel the 'Jordanian Law' have failed. In 2022, Israel’s High Court of Justice rejected a petition by the Regavim group to change the law. The court said it is a political decision and legislation is required to change it. Residents of Judea and Samaria have circumvented the law until now by opening companies with the Civil Administration and purchasing land through those companies. Sponsoring the proposed law are members of the Knesset Land of Israel Caucus, a group of Israeli parliament members whose mission is to strengthen Israel’s hold on Judea and Samaria. Forty members of the caucus signed onto the bill, which they say is 'correcting a historical injustice and stopping racial discrimination.' 'While the Palestinians are shouting about fake ‘apartheid,’ right here in Israel, Jordanian apartheid against Jews is taking place,' said MK Moshe Solomon of the Religious Zionism Party and one of the heads of the Land of Israel Caucus. The law will fix an upside-down situation in which a Jewish state has permitted 'racist discrimination against Jews to exist since the British Mandate,' he said.

‘Electronic Intifada’ co-founder arrested in Switzerland	Zurich Canton Councilor Mario Fehr told the Swiss newspaper, 'We do not want an Islamist Jew-hater who calls for violence in Switzerland.' By JNS Ali Abunimah, co-founder and executive director of the anti-Israel Electronic Intifada website, was arrested by Swiss police ahead of a speaking engagement in Zurich on Saturday, the organization said. The Palestinian-American activist 'is currently being detained and has had access to legal counsel,' according to the Saturday statement. Electronic Intifada said that Abunimah was also interrogated by police at Zurich Airport for an hour before being allowed to enter the country. According to the report by Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Abunimah had been invited by The Palestine Committee Zurich. The Swiss daily added that local police had been notified of Abunimah’s planned appearance and submitted a request to the Federal Office of Police that he be banned.

In a statement, the committee said it was 'outraged' by what it called a 'reminder of the increasing attempts to stifle voices calling for justice and accountability.' The Arab organization called on the U.S. State Department to 'fulfill its responsibility to protect the rights of its citizens abroad and do what it can to secure the safe and immediate release of Abunimah.' Abunimah previously celebrated Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, murder of 1,200 people—primarily Jewish civilians—as an 'anti-colonial operation.' On Nov. 10, the Electronic Intifada founder wrote in a post on X, 'From ‘mass rapes‘ and ‘burned babies‘ on 7 October 2023, to ‘anti-Semitic pogroms‘ against genocidal ‘Israeli’ hooligans in the Netherlands now, the genocidal Zionist regime and its savage and barbaric Western accomplices lie and lie to justify and cover up their hideous crimes.' According to the NGO Monitor group, Abunimah frequently makes Holocaust references. He has called Gaza a 'concentration camp' and repeated a claim that Israeli army statements are the words 'of a Nazi.' The American activist has called the Gaza Strip a 'ghetto for surplus non-Jews,' compared the press in the Jewish state to Nazi Germany’s Der Sturmer, and declared in 2010 that 'Supporting Zionism is not atonement for the Holocaust, but its continuation in spirit.'

Elon Musk lauds ‘German pride,’ rejects Holocaust guilt in addres...	Days before Holocaust Remembrance Day, billionaire mogul Elon Musk says German's must embrace 'German pride' and 'move beyond past guilt,' in address to nationalist AfD party. By World Israel News Staff Billionaire tech mogul and administrator of the new federal Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk addressed a gathering of a right-wing German party Saturday, calling on Germans to look beyond the national guilty associated with the Holocaust and embrace 'German pride.' On Saturday, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party held an event in Halle in eastern Germany, kicking off its general election campaign ahead of a national vote slated for February 23rd. Since the collapse of the ruling coalition, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz' center-left Social Democratic Party, the rightist AfD has gained significant ground, and is currently polling in second place, with 20-21% of recent polls, behind the center-right Christian Democratic Union, with 30%. In the 2021 election, by comparison, the AfD received just 10% of the vote, making it the fifth largest party in Germany. During Saturday's event, Musk addressed AfD supporters in a video message urging Germans to reclaim their national pride. In his video message, Musk emphasized 'that people take pride in Germany and being German.' Speaking just two days before International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Musk appeared to reference the legacy of the Holocaust, telling attendees that in Germany 'there is too much focus on past guilty, and we need to move beyond that.' 'Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great grandparents.' 'We need to look at the future of Germany with optimism and enthusiasm. It's important to be proud of these German culture and values. It's about preserving German culture and protecting the German people. Convince people to vote AfD.' Musk took aim at multiculturalism during his address, and in particular Germany's liberal immigration policies, urging party chief Alice Weidel not to allow the AfD's values to be subverted by 'some kind of multiculturalism that dilutes everything.'

11 dead in clashes near Israel, Lebanon border	Beirut claims 11 dead, dozens wounded after Lebanese soldiers and civilians clash with IDF forces in southern Lebanon as Israeli withdrawal delayed. By World Israel News Staff Eleven people were killed and dozens more wounded after clashes broke out between Israeli forces and Lebanese civilians and soldiers in southern Lebanon Sunday morning. Thousands of Lebanese approached IDF soldiers stationed across southern Lebanon Sunday, anticipating the withdrawal of Israeli forces as part of the November 2024 ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah. Earlier, however, Israel announced that given the recent discoveries of Hezbollah weapons caches near the Israeli border, the continued presence of Hezbollah forces south of the Litani River, and the failure of the Lebanese Army to assume full military control over the country - all violations of the ceasefire deal - the IDF would remain in southern Lebanon beyond the January 26th deadline. The Israeli military's chief Arabic spokesman, Col. Avichay Adraee, warned locals against approaching towns under IDF security control, releasing a map of areas where movement is restricted. 'The IDF has no intention of attacking you, but for now, movement south of this line is prohibited until further notice. Anyone crossing south does so at their own risk.' Nevertheless, mobs of Lebanese - many of them waving Hezbollah flags - gathered at the entrances of villages in southern Lebanon, confronting the IDF forces stationed in the area, leading to clashes, including the use of live fire. In at least some of the clashes, Lebanese Army soldiers were involved, including in an incident in the town of Mais al-Jabal, during which one Lebanese soldier was killed and another wounded. According to a statement by the Lebanese health ministry, 11 people were killed during the clashes Sunday, with at least 83 more wounded. 'The aggressions of the Israeli enemy against citizens trying to return to their villages that are still under occupation have left 11 people dead, including a soldier of the Lebanese army, and two women, as well as 83 wounded so far,' the ministry said. In a statement issued Sunday afternoon, the Israeli military confirmed hte clashes and the use of gunfire in several incidents. 'Earlier today, IDF forces operating in the southern Lebanon area fired warning shots to neutralize a threat at several locations where suspects were spotted approaching them,' an IDF spokesperson said. 'Several suspects were detained in the area as they acted near IDF forces and posed a tangible threat. The suspects are currently being interrogated on-site.' 'The IDF is deployed in southern Lebanon, continuing to operate in accordance with the understandings between Israel and Lebanon and monitoring Hezbollah's attempts to return to the southern Lebanon area.' 'The IDF will act to eliminate any threat to the State of Israel and its forces.'

Trump halts nearly all foreign aid	President Donald Trump imposes near-total ban on foreign aid - with the exception of military aid to Egypt and Israel. By World Israel News Staff The United States State Department has frozen nearly all foreign aid programs, according to multiple reports Friday. Politico, the BBC, and CNN all obtained memos circulated by Trump administration Secretary of State Marco Rubio halting spending on virtually every foreign aid program, including military aid to Ukraine. The order was based on an executive order signed by President Donald Trump during his first day in office on Monday, entitled 'Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid.' Trump's order instructed federal officials to suspend aid programs for a 90-day reassessment period, during which each program will be scrutinized for its impact on 'American interests' and alignment with 'American values.' 'It is the policy of United States that no further United States foreign assistance shall be disbursed in a manner that is not fully aligned with the foreign policy of the President of the United States,' the order reads in part. While no aid will be disbursed during the 90-day assessment period, exceptions were made in the case of military aid to Israel and Egypt, Politico and CNN reported. Waivers have also been issued for emergency food programs and payment for preexisting expenses. One State Department official said that the department's internal leadership was stunned by the move. 'State just totally went nuclear on foreign assistance,' the source said. Along with Ukraine, the freeze also impacts Jordan and Taiwan, officials cited by Politico said. According to the BBC, the vast majority of the $68 billion the U.S. spent on foreign aid in 2023 will be impacted by the freeze. 'No new funds shall be obligated for new awards or extensions of existing awards until each proposed new award or extension has been reviewed and approved,' the internal State Department document reportedly reads.

Jailed terrorist refused to be released as part of hostage deal	A different terrorist was released in his stead as part of the exchange for the four IDF observers. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A Palestinian who was supposed to be released among the 200 terrorists exchanged for four IDF observers preferred staying in jail than being sent to the Gaza Strip, Channel 11 reported Saturday. The man, who is a member of Fatah, the movement behind the Palestinian Authority (PA) that is a bitter rival of the Hamas organization, was reportedly being threatened by the Islamist forces who still rule Gaza despite having been militarily decimated by Israel. He therefore demanded to be released to the PA-controlled territory in Judea and Samaria, or be deported to another country. When he was told that it was either Gaza or to stay in Ketziot Prison, he opted not to be freed and his place was taken by another terrorist. 'This is a very unusual story,' said reporter Roi Yanovsky, 'but it could above all show what the status of Hamas still is in Gaza, certainly for someone who can be fingered as opposing it, and the fear of this prisoner who is identified with Fatah to return to Gaza.' Another prisoner had made similar demands, but when the choice of Gaza or remaining imprisoned was presented to him, he chose to get on the bus taking 16 of the released terrorists to the Strip via the Kerem Shalom crossing. While 137 terrorists belonging to Hamas were freed, as well as 29 belonging to direct Iranian proxy Palestinian Islamic Jihad, 26 Fatah terrorists were also released in this second of six hostages-for-security prisoners exchanges. Out of the 200 terrorists in total who were released, over half of them serving multiple life sentences for the murders they planned or committed, 114 were taken to Ramallah, the PA’s capital, and a further 70 were deported to Egypt. Those brought to Cairo will be taken about a week from now to exile in a different country, possibly Turkey, Qatar or Algeria. Despite being ordered by Defense Minister Yisrael Katz to prevent public celebrations over the release of the murderers in Judea and Samaria, the IDF did not manage to stop jubilant crowds from gathering in such places as Kafr Aqab and Beit Hanina in eastern Jerusalem to hail them as heroes, carrying the freed prisoners on their shoulders, shooting repeatedly into the air, and waving multiple flags of Hamas as a sign of victory.

Trump announces lifting of arms limitations on Israel	President Trump says weapons ordered by IDF but blocked by Biden administration will now be transferred to Israel, marking end to partial arms embargo imposed during Gaza war. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump announced over the weekend the lifting of restrictions on arms sales imposed by the Biden administration on the Israeli military. Trump took to his Truth Social account Saturday night, writing that weapons systems which 'were ordered and paid for' by Israel but blocked by the Biden administration are now being transferred to the IDF. 'A lot of things that were ordered and paid for by Israel, but have not been sent by Biden, are now on their way!' The decision marks a reversal of the May, 2024 decision by the Biden White House to hold up the transfer of some offensive weapons systems, including a shipment of MK-84 (BLU-117) 2,000-pound aerial bombs Israel had purchased. The administration said the limits on weapons sales were imposed after Jerusalem refused to back down from its planned ground operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the last major remaining Hamas stronghold in the Gaza Strip at the time. Last Friday, Axios published a report citing three Israeli officials who claimed that the Trump administration had ordered the Defense Department to lift the arms limitations put in place by President Biden. The Pentagon notified Israel that day of the lifting of the ban. The transfer of the 1,800 MK-84 bombs held up by the Biden White House will be completed within the next few days, the officials said. A week earlier, Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Mike Herzog said Jerusalem expected the new administration to lift the arms limits imposed by Biden. 'We believe that Trump is going to release, at the beginning of his term, the munitions that haven't been released until now by the Biden administration,' Herzog said.

Rabbi’s letter fetches $700,000 at auction	The letter was discovered within a remarkable volume containing hundreds of manuscripts and signatures from prominent 18th-century Moroccan Torah scholars. By Assaf Golan, JNS A historic handwritten letter by Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar (c1696-1743), the revered author of the biblical commentary 'Or HaChaim,' sold for $700,000 (2.5 million shekels) at auction in Jerusalem on Wednesday. The sale, conducted by Kedem Auction House, includes an additional 25% commission fee. The manuscript, which emerged from a comprehensive collection assembled by Israeli attorney Avigdor Klagsbald, features the distinctive signature of Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar and addresses the Jewish religious judges of Meknes regarding tax relief for a community member. The letter was discovered within a remarkable volume containing hundreds of manuscripts and signatures from prominent 18th-century Moroccan Torah scholars, including Rabbi Yaakov ibn Tzur and Rabbi Yehudah ben Attar. A rare handwritten letter by Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar, author of 'Or HaChaim.' Credit: Kedem Auction House. Chaim ibn Attar‘s legacy extends far beyond this single document. As a leading advocate for Jewish emigration to the Land of Israel, he led by example during a period of severe persecution and famine in Morocco. These challenging circumstances not only influenced his decision to immigrate but also impacted the writing of his seminal work 'Or HaChaim,' where he acknowledged variations in commentary length due to the period’s upheavals. In a journey that would shape Jerusalem’s religious landscape, Chaim ibn Attar arrived first in Acre with 30 students, intending to establish a yeshivah. After navigating through epidemics in the Galilee, he eventually settled in Jerusalem, where he purchased a historic courtyard—now known as the Old Yishuv Courtyard, it is traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, commonly known as the Ari, two centuries earlier—and established his study hall. Chaim ibn Attar, a Sephardic rabbi, achieved unprecedented recognition among Chassidic communities throughout Europe, with his writings becoming cornerstone texts in Chassidic thought. The study hall he founded demonstrated similar resilience, surviving the 1948 Jordanian destruction of Jewish institutions and later undergoing renovation on Or HaChaim Street in the Jewish Quarter following the Six-Day War. Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar’s influence continues well beyond his brief life, which ended at age 47 in 1743. His tomb on Jerusalem’s Mount of Olives serves as a significant pilgrimage site, drawing thousands annually who seek blessings at the final resting place of this influential scholar.

Palestinian Authority chairman congratulates terrorist mastermind...	Yasser Abu Bakr orchestrated multiple deadly terror attacks, including one in which a nine-month-old baby was murdered. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israeli politicians slammed Palestinian Authority (PA) chairman Mahmoud Abbas for congratulating a terrorist convicted of multiple murders upon his release as part of the Israel-Hamas hostage deal Saturday, saying it demonstrated the PA leader's support for terrorism. On Saturday, Abbas called Yasser Abu Bakr, a senior member of the PA’s own terrorist force, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, who had been freed after serving 23 years of a 115-year sentence imposed after he planned several terror attacks and armed the men who carried them out. The terrorists operating on Abu Bakr's behalf opened fire on guests at a Netanya hotel lobby in 2002, murdering Israel Yahya and his nine-month-old baby, Malka and wounding 50 others. Abu Bakr was also behind the murder of a police officer, and planned a suicide bombing of a Tel Aviv hospital. 'This was for the homeland, but they went overboard with you,' Abbas reportedly said, seemingly referring to the long sentence Abu Bakr had received. 'I don’t think that there’s any reason to celebrate after all those thousands died in Gaza,' Abu Bakr allegedly responded. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was incensed by the call, saying that through showing sympathy for a child-murderer the PA president was revealing his group’s true beliefs. 'Mahmoud Abbas was and remains an enemy who supports terror,' he posted to X, 'and the Authority he heads was and remains a terrorist organization and not a 'partner' for anything.' 'His phone call tonight to the murderer of Jews is a wake-up call to those who still delude themselves about the Palestinian Authority as an alternative to Hamas in Gaza after the war,' he continued. 'It will not happen. Not in Gaza, nor in Judea and Samaria.' Otzma Yehudit Chairman Itamar Ben-Gvir, who resigned from the government in protest of the hostage deal, criticized the way the coalition was handling it and the ceasefire. 'Close your eyes to the Palestinian terrorist authority that rewards murderers of Jews and educates them in terrorism,' he wrote. 'Release thousands of murderers and terrorists. Stop the war in Gaza. Withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor and northern Gaza. Transfer bulldozers to Hamas.' 'And of course, don't forget to tell us that they are deterred. It's time to change the approach,' he urged. Israel Beitenu head Avigdor Liberman of the Opposition also condemned Abbas. 'Holocaust-denying Abu Mazen [Abbas’ nom de guerre] is again showing his true face – a terror supporter who congratulates low-down murderers,' he said. 'Anyone who embraces terrorists with blood on their hands is himself a terrorist, and cannot be a partner in any initiative, especially not to oversee the Rafah crossing,' he added. Israel is reportedly considering allowing the PA to be in charge of the Gazan side of its southern border with Egypt, which Hamas had used for decades as a smuggling route for weapons of every kind. Abu Bakr was one of the 200 terrorists Israel released Saturday in exchange for four female IDF border observers who had been abducted during the Hamas-led invasion and massacre on October 7, 2023.

Three IDF soldiers wounded in Jenin counterterror op	Israeli ground forces launched the operation with the stated goal of preserving Jerusalem’s ability to swiftly act against terrorist groups in Jenin, known among Palestinians as the 'Martyrs’ Capital.' By JNS Three Israel Defense Forces soldiers were wounded, one seriously, during counter-terrorism operations in the Palestinian city of Jenin in northern Samaria on Saturday, according to the military. The troops, all members of the Egoz commando unit, were evacuated to the hospital for treatment and their families were informed. Israeli forces engaged in firefights with terrorists in Jenin’s refugee camp on Saturday, according to Arab media reports. During the clashes, explosives were reportedly used against IDF troops. Since the start of 'Operation Iron Wall' in Jenin on Jan. 21, Israeli security forces have killed a dozen terrorists and arrested some 20 wanted individuals, the IDF announced on Friday.

On Tuesday night, an unnamed senior security force told the Channel 14 News broadcaster that the large-scale campaign against Iranian-backed terrorist groups in northern Samaria could take months.

Herzi Halevi said on Thursday that Jenin has become a haven for 'those who want to organize an attack and those who carried out an attack and are looking for a safe place,' saying it is 'very appropriate to go hard on the Jenin camp.' 'We need to be prepared for continuous operations in the Jenin refugee camp, to handle pressure and, at the same time, know how to do other things as well,' the chief of staff said. 'Few casualties on our side, many casualties for the enemy, destruction of infrastructure. I think such a continuous effort will bring the Jenin refugee camp to a different place.'

Hamas violates ceasefire, doesn’t give status update on hostages	Hamas has not told Israel which hostages are living or dead, despite promise to do so by second week of truce. By World Israel News Staff Hamas has not given Israel a list of the remaining hostages specifying their health status, marking the second time the terror group has failed to abide by the terms of the ceasefire in days. According to the truce, Hamas is required to provide Israel with critical information about the hostages, including whether they are living, dead, or experiencing life-threatening health issues, by the end o the second week of the ceasefire. Israel had requested the list before ceasefire came into effect, but Hamas claimed that it needed a break in the fighting in order to obtain that information about the hostages. However, even after the second batch of Israeli hostages and Palestinian terrorists were freed, Hamas has not held up its end of the agreement. On Saturday, Hamas released four female soldiers who had been held captive in the Strip since October 2023, in exchange for the release of 200 Palestinian prisoners, 120 of which were murderers serving life sentences. However, Hamas did not release Arbel Yehud, who is believed to be the last living female civilian hostage held in the Strip. While Israel welcomed the return of the female soldiers, Jerusalem stressed that Hamas had violated the ceasefire by failing to return Yehud. Hamas claimed that Yehud is being held by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terror group, which had decided to categorize her as a 'soldier' due to the fact that she underwent training as pat of Israel's space program at some point in her life. Under the terms of the agreement, Israel releases a larger number of prisoners for soldiers, and a smaller number for civilians. Because of Hamas' violations of the truce, Israel is not allowing displaced Gazan civilians to return to their homes in the northern Strip. The Israeli government has said it will not grant them permission to do so until Yehud is freed.

Israel to UNRWA: Shut down and leave Jerusalem by Jan. 30	UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini claimed that UNRWA was planning to 'stay and deliver' services in Palestinian enclaves. By World Israel News Staff Israel confirmed to the United Nations last week that the UNRWA organization is required to halt its activities in Jerusalem and vacate its offices by Thursday, January 30th. 'UNRWA is required to cease its operations in Jerusalem and evacuate all premises in which it operates in the city no later' than the January 30th deadline, Israel's Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, wrote to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres last Friday. New laws recently passed by the Knesset have barred UNRWA from operating in Israel, as well as severely restricting their capabilities to operate in Palestinian Authority-controlled territory in Judea and Samaria, along with the Gaza Strip. Earlier in January, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini claimed that UNRWA was planning to 'stay and deliver' services in Palestinian enclaves. Lazzarini admitted that because UNRWA has 'no bureaucratic or operational relations' with Israel, the organization's continued functioning is a challenge. While there has been ample evidence provided by Israel regarding UNRWA employees' ties to Hamas, its leadership has long downplayed the phenomenon. Dozens of UNRWA employees took part in the October 7th massacres, including kidnapping Israelis. One video from a kibbutz security camera shows gunmen fatally shooting Israeli civilians, then loading a body into an official UN vehicle. Israeli intelligence estimates that more than 10 percent of UNRWA employees in the Strip are affiliated with Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terror groups. 'The U.N. has been unable and or unwilling to eliminate Hamas militants and their supporters, as well as those from other terrorist groups, from their ranks,' James Lindsay, who served as UNRWA’s general counsel until 2007, told the New York Times in December 2024. 'UNRWA hiring practices and the makeup of the labor pool from which UNRWA draws its employees suggests to me that the numbers the Israelis are talking about are probably pretty close to the truth.'

U.S. intel – 15,000 new Hamas recruits balance out war casualties	Some Israeli assessments estimate the number of Hamas fighters killed at 20,000. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror group recruited up to 15,000 new operatives during the recent war with Israel, meaning that the organization has replaced nearly all of the terrorists slain during the conflict. U.S. Congressional sources, citing intelligence reports, told Reuters that it's believed Hamas has gained between 10,000 and 15,000 new members. Notably, the sources say, almost an identical number of Hamas operatives are believed to have been killed in battle against the Israeli military. Some Israeli assessments estimate the number of Hamas fighters killed at 20,000. In a media statement, Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said that the recruitment of new terror operatives does not correlate with a greater threat posed by Hamas. 'Even if they recruit young people, they don’t have the weapons or training facilities to turn them into effective fighters,' he said. 'Yes, they can incite hatred against Israel, but without equipment or training, they can’t mount a significant threat.' Outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Herzi HaLevi wrote in his resignation letter that the army had 'inflicted severe damage on Hamas’s military wing.' But HaLevi warned that Hamas had not yet been defeated. 'The war’s objectives have yet to be fully achieved. The IDF will continue to fight to dismantle Hamas’s governance and military capabilities, to secure the return of all the hostages, and to strengthen the security conditions that will allow the safe return of residents to their homes in the south and north,' he wrote. During a recent speech, outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared to blame Israel for Hamas clinging on to power in the Strip. Blinken charged that Israel’s hesitancy to promote new governance in the coastal enclave had created a power vacuum, which served Hamas’s interests. 'Each time Israel completes its military operations and pulls back, Hamas militants regroup and reemerge because there’s nothing else to fill the void,' Blinken said. 'Indeed, we assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost,' he added. 'That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war.'

Trump pressuring Egypt, Jordan to take in Gazans	President Trump calls Gaza Strip 'a real mess,' hopes to find Arab state to take in 1.5 million Gazans during Gaza's reconstruction. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump is pressuring Cairo and Amman to take in large numbers of refugees from the Gaza Strip, suggesting the move could be either temporary or permanent. Speaking with reporters onboard Air Force One on Saturday, the president called the war-torn coastal enclave 'a real mess,' and said he expected Jordan and Egypt taking in the bulk of the Gaza Strip's population of 2.2 million people. Discussing his phone call with Jordanian King Abdullah II on Saturday, Trump said he hopes the monarch will 'take people' into his kingdom. 'I said to him 'I'd love you to take on more because I'm looking at the whole Gaza strip right now and it's a mess, it's a real mess'. I'd like him to take people.' Trump also alluded to his upcoming call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi slated for Sunday, saying he has a similar message for Cairo, with the hopes of securing refuge for some 1.5 million Gazans. 'I'd like Egypt to take people,' Trump told reporters. 'You're talking about a million and half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say, ‘You know it’s, over.’' 'Something has to happen. It's literally a demolition site, almost everything is demolished and people are dying there, so I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change,' Trump continued. Trump added that he hoped to see Arab states be actively involved in providing a solution for Gazans, so that they 'could live in peace for a change.' When asked be reporters whether he expected Jordan and Egypt to house the refugees temporarily or long term, Trump said 'it could be either.' It 'could be temporary or long term,' Trump said. Last week, NBC News reported that the Trump administration is mulling plans to encourage a third-party state, possibly Indonesia, to temporarily take in large numbers of Gazans during Gaza's reconstruction. Jakarta responded negatively to the report, saying that any such move would be 'entirely unacceptable.'

Bibas family: ‘World came crashing down’ when hostage mother and ...	Shiri Silberman Bibas and her two young sons, Kfir and Ariel, were supposed to have been released according to the terms of the hostage release agreement. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Relatives of the Bibas family, held captive in Gaza, expressed that their 'world came crashing down' when the mother and children were not on the list of hostages slated for release on Saturday. Shiri Silberman Bibas and her two young sons, Kfir and Ariel, were supposed to have been released according to the terms of the hostage release agreement that said civilian women and children were the first to be released. Yarden Bibas, Shiri Silberman Bibas' husband and father of the children, is scheduled to be released later in the first phase of the hostage deal. On Saturday night, relatives of the Bibas family released a statement criticizing the Israeli media for not addressing 'our pain, our struggle, and most importantly, the urgent need to address the complexity and tragedy of their absence from the list.' The statement continued,'Does the profound worry for their lives override the fact that they are innocent civilians in captivity, who must be brought home?' they asked. 'Does the deep concern for Shiri's life erase the need to show her photo as a kidnapped civilian in Gaza, whose fate remains uncertain?' 'The answer is—no.' The statement went on to express happiness over the release of four female soldiers on Saturday night while resolving to keep fighting for the return of the Bibas family. 'Liri, Daniela, Naama, and Karina — We are waiting to see you smile, surrounded by love, back home with your amazing families. Shiri, Yarden, Ariel, and Kfir — We will keep hoping and fighting for your return. It’s not over until it's over,' the relatives’ statement concluded. On Satuday, Hamas released four female soldiers Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev. According to the hostage release agreement, civilian women and children were supposed to have been freed before soldiers. Regarding the Bibas family, on Saturday night, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said there are 'grave concerns for their fate.' Hagari added that said Israel awaits more details about the Bibas family soon. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Gazans would not be allowed to return to their homes in northern Gaza until female civilian hostage Arbel Yehud is released according to the agreement.

The four women, who were kidnapped from Nahal Oz on October 7, 2023 while working as military observers, were held together with a fifth female soldier, Agam Berger. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Four female soldiers released on Saturday night—Liri Albag, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, and Karina Ariev—shared details about the 477 days they spent as hostages in Gaza. The four women, who were kidnapped from Nahal Oz on October 7, 2023 while working as military observers, were held together with a fifth female soldier, Agam Berger, who is slated for release next week. They told Kan News it was difficult to leave Agam Berger behind when they received news of their release. The women explained that early in their captivity, they were cared for by an elderly hostage who ensured they could shower and had food. The hostages said that they were forced to cook and clean for Gazan families and to look after their children. They revealed that the elderly hostage was later killed in Gaza. The released hostages said they were moved frequently and kept in civilian homes and Gaza tunnels, often in unsanitary conditions. Their Hamas captors also moved them around Gaza City and disguised them as Arab women. The freed hostages said they appeared on Arab media and on Al Jazeera and that they they learned about the hostage releases in November. One of them mentioned hearing her family send birthday greetings on the radio. They said their Hamas captors told them about events of the war in Gaza, including the collapse of a building in December that killed 21 soldiers. The hostages reported that their captors often treated them with contempt, mockingly referring to them as 'the soldiers.' They described Liri Albag as 'the group leader' during their captivity. The freed hostages told their parents, 'There were times when we had no food, and when the IDF launched attacks on nearby areas, it was terrifying. But we supported one another and helped each other survive.' Prior to their release, Hamas cynically staged a 'release ceremony' for them, parading them onstage in front of a crowd in Gaza City. They were given identification tags around their necks, which included details of their captivity, such as the kidnapping and release dates, their full names, and ID card numbers. The four hostages said that during the ceremony, they 'showed them on the stage that it did not bother us. We are stronger than that.'

Hamas frees 4 female Israeli soldiers, keeps one civilian behind	In exchange, Israel is expected to release 200 Palestinian terrorists, many who were serving life sentences for murder. By JNS and WIN Israelis on Saturday rejoiced at the return of four female IDF soldiers—Karina Ariev, 20, Daniella Gilboa, 20, Naama Levy, 20, and Liri Albag, 19—who were abducted from the Nahal Oz base during the Hamas-led invasion of the northwestern Negev on Oct. 7, 2023. The Israel Defense Forces earlier Saturday completed preparations for the return of the captives, who were brought to a military facility near the border for a preliminary physical and psychological examination. Thereafter, they were slated to meet with their parents—this time fathers as well as mothers—for the first time since being kidnapped 477 days ago. They will then be flown by helicopter to Beilinson Hospital in Petach Tikvah, near Tel Aviv. If they had needed urgent care, they would have been taken to a hospital closer to the Gaza Strip—either Soroka Medical Center in Beersheva or Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon—but this was not the case. In exchange, Jerusalem is expected to release 200 Palestinian terrorists (50 for each soldier—30 serving life sentences and 20 who were supposed to remain in prison for up to 15 years). Terrorists who were 'convicted of murder, of manufacturing weapons used for murder, or of directing the carrying out a fatal attack' are to be deported to the Gaza Strip or abroad, instead of to Judea, Samaria and eastern Jerusalem. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal, Hamas was supposed to free female civilian hostages before soldiers. One civilian woman, 29-year-old Arbel Yehud, remains in Gaza. It is not clear whether her exclusion from Saturday’s release will complicate the agreement. Shiri Bibas, 33, another female civilian hostage, was taken with her two children, and they are included on the list of the 33 hostages to be released. Hamas, however, claimed in November that they were killed. Three civilian women—Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher—were released last Sunday in return for 90 terrorists (30 for each civilian) shortly after the ceasefire went into effect. Of the hostages whom Hamas kidnapped on Oct. 7, 87 are still in Gaza, including 30 who are believed to be dead. Hamas also holds three additional hostages taken before the 2023 attack.

According to the agreement, Hamas was supposed to release female civilian captives, including Arbel Yehud, before freeing female soldiers. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel announced on Saturday that Palestinians would not be allowed to return to their homes in northern Gaza until Hamas releases the civilian captive, female hostage Arbel Yehud, according to the hostage release agreement. Hamas released four female IDF soldiers on Saturday: Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, and Liri Albag. According to the agreement, Hamas was supposed to release female civilian captives, including Arbel Yehud, before freeing female soldiers. Palestinian Islamic Jihad, believed to be holding Yehud hostage, said they would release her 'according to the terms of the deal.' The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the release of the four female soldiers but added that Gazans would not be allowed to return to the north until Arbel Yehud is released. 'Israel has received four female soldiers who had been taken hostage by the Hamas terrorist group today. In exchange, the country will release security prisoners as part of the agreement,' according to a statement from the Prime Minister's Office. 'In accordance with the agreement, Israel will not permit Gazans to move north of the Gaza Strip until arrangements are made for the release of civilian Arbel Yehud, who was scheduled to be freed today,' the statement continued. The decision was reportedly made after a discussion with Netanyahu about the names of the four hostages to be released, but was not announced prior to their release due to concerns that Hamas might sabotage the deal. Walla reports that Israel asked the Trump Administration to pressure Qatar and Egypt to demand Arbel Yehud's release. Yehud was scheduled to be released in the previous hostage release agreement in November 2023, but remained in captivity after the deal collapsed. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari announced that 'Hamas did not abide by its obligation in the deal to free civilian women first.' He insisted that Arbel Yehud must be released and, concerning the Bibas family, said, 'We have heavy concerns for their fate.' Hagari also said Israel was committed to the return of Agam Berger, the only one of the five female soldiers still held captive in Gaza.

By Philissa Cramer, JTA Before she was released from Gaza last week, Emily Damari asked her captors for a favor: to let her neighbor Keith Siegel go free instead. That’s according to a report in Israeli media on Friday, five days after Damari was released and on the eve of a second expected release of Israeli hostages from Gaza. Siegel, 65, and Damari were both taken captive by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, from Kfar Aza, the kibbutz of roughly 760 people in southern Israel where they lived. Damari, 28, is the same age as one of Siegel’s four children; his wife Aviva was also abducted but released in November 2023 during a temporary ceasefire. The request was denied, according to the report, which first aired on Israel’s Channel 12. Israel and Hamas agreed on a schedule for the release of 33 hostages, most of them alive, over six weeks as part of a ceasefire deal; the schedule calls for women to be released first, followed by older and sick men, including Siegel. The report suggests that at least some remaining hostages are being kept together and offers new evidence that Siegel is alive inside Gaza. An immigrant from the United States, Siegel appeared in a hostage video released by Hamas last April. His mother died in December in North Carolina, where he grew up. Since her release, Damari has become a symbol in Israel because she returned with bandages making her injured hand resemble the 'rock on' emoji. Among those welcoming her as she was driven back into Israel was Keith Siegel’s daughter Shir, who posted on Instagram later that night, 'I am speechless. … My sister is home. I hugged her.

US drops Judea, Samaria residents from sanctions list	Fifty-eight individuals and organizations were deleted from the list, including one Palestinian terrorist organization, the 'Lion’s Den' from Nablus in Samaria. By JNS U.S. President Donald Trump’s revocation of sanctions implemented against Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria by the Biden administration came into effect on Friday, with the West Bank-Related Sanctions program having been removed from the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) website. According to the OAFC, all persons designated for financial sanctions under former President Joe Biden’s Executive Order 14115 of Feb. 1, 2024, were removed from the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List). 'All property and interests in property blocked under E.O. 14115 are unblocked,' the OAFC confirmed on Friday. Fifty-eight individuals and organizations were deleted from the list, including one Palestinian terrorist organization, the 'Lion’s Den' from Nablus in Samaria. 'The previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal and radical practices within every agency and office of the federal government,' Trump said on Monday, after revoking a host of what he called 'harmful' executive orders and actions of the former administration. In addition to revoking the order regarding residents of Judea and Samaria, Trump also canceled Executive Order 14022 from April 1, 2021, in which Biden ended the 'national emergency' with respect to the International Criminal Court. The court, which is based in The Hague and is independent of the United Nations, has issued arrest warrants for Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. By revoking Biden’s executive order, Trump returned Executive Order 13928 from June 11, 2020, which referred to the court’s 'illegitimate assertions of jurisdiction over personnel of the United States and certain of its allies' and sanctioned those connected to the court who asserted such jurisdiction. After Trump defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris in November’s presidential election, leaders and activists across the Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria were nearly unanimous in their praises for the Republican candidate. Attorney Marc Zell, a resident of Tekoa in Gush Etzion in Judea who serves as chairman of Republicans Overseas Israel, told JNS, 'In the previous Trump administration, the secretary of state [Mike Pompeo] stated unequivocally that Jewish presence, settlement and development in Judea and Samaria is both legal and appropriate. 'The Harris-Biden-Obama administration rescinded this policy and reverted to the Obama-Biden administration policy, which treated Jewish presence in Judea and Samaria as an obstacle to peace and ‘illegitimate.’ This will likely change dramatically during the coming Trump administration—for the better,' Zell said.

Freeing terrorists a moral and security ‘failure,’ bereaved famil...	We’ve seen how released terrorists quickly reintegrate into their networks, sometimes even assuming leadership roles. In some cases, they orchestrate attacks within months of their release. This is not speculation; it’s documented reality,' former prison manager Menashe Nahum said. By Sveta Listratov, TPS As Israel prepares to release more than 1,000 Palestinian terrorists in exchange for hostages, experts and bereaved families questioned the security implications and the justice of freeing inmates, many of whom are serving life sentences for murder. 'This part of the agreement with Hamas signals to terrorists that violence pays off, undermining the sacrifices of soldiers and civilians who gave their lives for the country,' Herzl Hajaj told The Press Service of Israel. His daughter, Lt. Shir Hajaj, was one of four soldiers killed in a truck-ramming attack in Jerusalem in 2017. Hajaj leads the Choosing Life forum, which consists of hundreds of Israeli families of terror victims. Security analysts warned TPS-IL of a potential surge in terrorism from the release of terrorists. 'Every deal like this is a morale booster for terrorist organizations. It’s not just about manpower; it’s about showing their supporters that their methods work and that Israel can be pressured into releasing high-profile prisoners,' Menashe Nahum explained to TPS-IL. Nahum has extensive experience managing Israel’s high-security prisons including a decade at the Ramon Prison, Israel’s largest. 'We’ve seen how released terrorists quickly reintegrate into their networks, sometimes even assuming leadership roles. In some cases, they orchestrate attacks within months of their release. This is not speculation; it’s documented reality,' Nahum said. Many of the 1,027 terrorists freed in the Gilad Shalit exchange of 2011 returned to terror, including Yahya Sinwar, who masterminded the October 7 attacks. Ronen Bar, head of the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet), reportedly told government ministers in January that 82% of the prisoners released for Shalit returned to terror. A legal petition filed by the Choosing Life Forum against the release of 292 terrorists serving life sentences was dismissed by the High Court of Justice, leaving the families in pain. 'They are exploding with rage, with fear. They don’t have much to do about it but protest, shout, yet no one is paying attention to it. This decision devalues the lives of every Israeli victim of terrorism. It’s not just a security issue—it’s a moral failure,' Hajaj tearfully told TPS-IL. Nahum personally knows many of the terrorists due to be released from their time behind bars. Among those widely expected to be released on Saturday is Zakaria Zubeidi, a former Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades commander in Jenin, responsible for multiple terror attacks. Six people were killed in 2002 when terrorists ordered by Zubeidi attacked a Likud branch building in Beit Shean with guns and grenades as party members were voting in a primary. 'The Shin Bet marked him as a potential leader of Fatah,' Nahum told TPS-IL. 'Zubeidi knows Judea and Samaria well, is familiar with Israelis, and built an extensive network of connections. Ruthless and cunning, he was the mastermind behind the daring escape from Gilboa Prison. He will cause significant trouble,' Nahum explained. Another terrorist set to be released in the deal is Mahmoud Atallah, who has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering a Palestinian woman he suspected of collaborating with Israel. Atallah was indicted in September for raping a female soldier working in the Gilboa Prison and sexually assaulting another guard. The case became a major scandal when information surfaced indicating prison officials had turned a blind eye to the attacks. 'He is a cruel man, a soldier of Zubeidi, committed to serving the interests of his people through terror,' Nahum said of Atallah. Another terrorist on the list expected to be freed later in the deal is Mohan Ashreen, who masterminded a 2002 suicide bombing at Netanya’s Park Hotel on Passover night. The attack killed 30 and injured 160. 'Imagine someone like this returning to Qalqilya, Nablus, or Ramallah. The weight of a man like this, who carried out one of the worst terror attacks on Passover night, is immense,' Nahum said. Responding to a question from TPS-IL, David Mencer, spokesman for the National Public Diplomacy Directorate in the Office of the Prime Minister said the agreement to release Palestinian prisoners is 'painful,' adding, 'but it was necessary to secure the return of our hostages. These convicted murderers will not be allowed to return to Judea and Samaria or Israel. They will be sent to third-party countries, and we are taking steps to minimize the risk they pose.' The first phase of the ceasefire will see 33 Israeli hostages freed over several weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how many of the 33 hostages are alive. Three have already been freed and four more are due to return on Saturday. Said Nahum, 'The emotional pull to bring our hostages home is undeniable. But as a nation, we must weigh that against the long-term security of every citizen. The hardest decisions are those where every choice carries a cost.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 94 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead.

Senate confirms Pete Hegseth as Defense Secretary	During his confirmation hearing, Hegseth framed himself as a much-needed agent of change, emphasizing his combat experience and deployments in the war on terror. By Alana Goodman, The Washington Free Beacon The Senate voted to confirm Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense on Friday following a tough confirmation battle in which Democrats and the media badgered him with personal attacks. Hegseth, a former Army National Guard officer and Fox News host won confirmation with a 51 to 50 vote. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote, making him the second VP to do so after Mike Pence helped secure Betsy Devos's confirmation as education secretary in 2017. Hegseth’s ascension comes after a monthlong effort from Democrats to sink the nomination. It also follows a flurry of anonymously sourced media articles that accused him of drinking excessively and running a misogynistic workplace while leading the veterans’ organization Concerned Veterans for America (CVA). Democrats leaned heavily on the reports while questioning Hegseth during his confirmation hearing. One of the sources behind the claims was former CVA employee Kat Dugan, who had worked for the organization for eight months before leaving after receiving a poor performance review, the Washington Free Beacon reported. In a last-ditch effort to stall his nomination this week, an affidavit from Hegseth’s former sister-in-law was leaked to NBC News, accusing Hegseth of abusing his ex-wife. Both Hegseth and his ex-wife publicly denied the allegation. During his confirmation hearing, Hegseth framed himself as a much-needed agent of change, emphasizing his combat experience and deployments in the war on terror and noting that prior defense secretaries often came from the upper ranks of the Pentagon, politics, and the defense industry. 'I've led troops in combat. I've been on patrol for days. I've pulled the trigger downrange, heard bullets whiz by, flex-cuffed insurgents, called in close air support, led medevacs, dodged IEDs, pulled out dead bodies, and knelt before a battlefield cross,' said Hegseth. 'This is not academic for me. This is my life. I led then, and I will lead now.' Pete Hegseth’s first words as Secretary of Defense: 'All praise and glory to God. His will be done.' Amen. pic.twitter.com/h4rBFq6ck4 — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) January 25, 2025 BREAKING: Pete Hegseth has officially been sworn in as the Secretary of Defense of the United States pic.twitter.com/Fhu8Re1bzn &mdash; America (@america) January 25, 2025 The post Senate confirms Pete Hegseth as Defense Secretary appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/senate-confirms-pete-hegseth-as-defense-secretary/	2025-01-25T10:26:20-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GiJo1McX0AACi3q.jpeg
‘Punishment of bullets’: Hamas executes 11 Palestinians accused o...	These executions are likely only the start of a widespread crackdown on those in Gaza who are suspected of 'collaborating with Israel.' By Jack Elbaum, The Algemeiner Hamas murdered 11 Palestinians in Gaza on Thursday which the terrorist organization accused of 'collaborating' with Israel, according to Hamas-aligned media sources. Gaza Now, a Hamas-aligned news outlet based in Gaza, reported on Thursday that 'six collaborators of the Zionist occupation were executed in Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip, a short while ago.' 'And punishing 17 others by shooting them in the feet as a result of exploiting the suffering of the people of Gaza and cooperating with the occupation in suffocating the people, raising prices, and stealing humanitarian aid, including merchants,' Gaza Now added. Then, the news outlet reported that 'five collaborators of the Zionist occupation were executed in the southern Gaza Strip a short while ago, bringing the number of collaborators executed today to 11.' Video posted by Gaza Now shows what appear to be Hamas terrorists shooting civilians who are lying on the ground. According to the outlet, these executions are likely only the start of a widespread crackdown on those in Gaza who are suspected of 'collaborating with Israel.' Adding that executions will begin to take place across the Gaza Strip, not just in Rafah, the outlet said that 'a special unit of the security services in Gaza will strike with an iron fist, and there will be no repentance for anyone except the punishment of bullets.' In response to the news, Hamza Hawidy, a Palestinian originally from Gaza City who is a peace activist, explained that this was to be 'expected' from Hamas, which has ruled Gaza with brutal force since it first took over the coastal enclave in the mid-2000s. 'This isn’t a novel tactic,' Hawidy argued. 'It’s an age-old strategy employed by Hamas to silence critics and instill fear among citizens who oppose their rule. I would greatly welcome a position from the pro-Palestinian movement advocating for pressure on Hamas to end its ongoing oppression of the people in Gaza.' Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, who is a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank and a Palestinian peace activist originally from Gaza, argued that 'many ‘human rights’ organizations around the world have long seen the videos of Hamas’s terrorist thugs brutalizing the civilian population in Gaza, never saying a word of acknowledgment or condemnation because, apparently, Palestinian lives are only worthwhile when Israeli military attacks kill them.' He added that 'anyone who is still remaining silent about Hamas’s brutal anti-Palestinian terrorism in Gaza after the ceasefire, when there is conclusive, visual, and overwhelming evidence of the group’s criminality, deserves to be ridiculed and forever shunned by the human rights activism and advocacy communities.'

Israeli forces to stay in south Lebanon beyond withdrawal deadlin...	The statement did not say how much longer Israeli forces might remain in south Lebanon, where the Israeli military says it has been seizing Hezbollah weapons and dismantling infrastructure used by the Shi’ite armed group. By Reuters and The Algemeiner Israeli forces will remain in southern Lebanon beyond a 60-day deadline stipulated in a ceasefire deal with the Iran-backed terrorist organization Hezbollah because its terms have not been fully implemented, the Israeli prime minister’s office said on Friday. Under the agreement, which took effect on Nov. 27, Hezbollah weapons and fighters must be removed from areas south of the Litani River and Israeli troops should withdraw as the Lebanese military deploys into the region, all within a 60-day timeframe, meaning by Sunday at 4 am (0200 GMT). The deal, brokered by the United States and France, ended more than a year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, which for years has wielded significant influence across Lebanon. The fighting peaked with a major Israeli offensive that left Hezbollah severely weakened and displaced more than 1.2 million people in Lebanon. In a statement, Netanyahu’s office said the Israeli military‘s withdrawal process was 'contingent on the Lebanese army deploying in southern Lebanon and fully and effectively enforcing the agreement, while Hezbollah withdraws beyond the Litani.' 'Since the ceasefire agreement has not yet been fully enforced by the Lebanese state, the gradual withdrawal process will continue, in full coordination with the United States.' The statement did not say how much longer Israeli forces might remain in south Lebanon, where the Israeli military says it has been seizing Hezbollah weapons and dismantling infrastructure used by the Shi’ite armed group. There was no immediate comment from Lebanon. HEZBOLLAH HAMMERED IN CONFLICT WITH ISRAEL A Hezbollah official, asked for comment, referred Reuters to a statement issued by the group on Thursday. This said that any delay of the withdrawal would be an unacceptable breach of the agreement and put the onus on the Lebanese state to act. It said the state would have to deal with such a violation 'through all means and methods guaranteed by international charters.' The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel said its campaign against Hezbollah aimed to secure the return home of tens of thousands of people forced to leave their homes in northern Israel by Hezbollah rocket fire. It inflicted major blows on Hezbollah during the conflict, killing its leader Hassan Nasrallah and thousands of the group’s fighters and destroying much of its arsenal. Hezbollah was further weakened in December when its Syrian ally, Bashar al-Assad, was toppled from power by rebels, cutting its overland supply route from Iran. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, noted that Israel was removing forces from Lebanon and the Lebanese army was going to locations of Hezbollah ammunition stores and destroying them, but added that more time was needed to 'achieve results.' The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said any 'renewal of hostilities would be a devastating blow for civilians still struggling to rebuild their lives.' 'Regional and international mediators must ensure this truce evolves into a lasting ceasefire, with a firm commitment to protecting all civilians and civilian infrastructure,' Maureen Philippon, Country Director NRC in Lebanon, said in a statement. More than 100,000 people remain displaced across Lebanon and the continued presence of Israeli troops is preventing civilians from returning home, according to the NRC.

Israel redeems four female IDF soldiers from Hamas captivity in G...	In exchange, Jerusalem is expected to release 200 Palestinian terrorists (50 for each soldier—30 serving life sentences and 20 who were supposed to remain in prison for up to 15 years). By JNS Israelis on Saturday rejoiced at the return of four female IDF soldiers—Karina Ariev, 20, Daniella Gilboa, 20, Naama Levy, 20, and Liri Albag, 19—who were abducted from the Nahal Oz base during the Hamas-led invasion of the northwestern Negev on Oct. 7, 2023. The Israel Defense Forces earlier Saturday completed preparations for the return of the captives, who were brought to a military facility near the border for a preliminary physical and psychological examination. Thereafter, they were slated to meet with their parents—this time fathers as well as mothers—for the first time since being kidnapped 477 days ago. They will then be flown by helicopter to Beilinson Hospital in Petach Tikvah, near Tel Aviv. If they had needed urgent care, they would have been taken to a hospital closer to the Gaza Strip—either Soroka Medical Center in Beersheva or Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon—but this was not the case. In exchange, Jerusalem is expected to release 200 Palestinian terrorists (50 for each soldier—30 serving life sentences and 20 who were supposed to remain in prison for up to 15 years). Terrorists who were 'convicted of murder, of manufacturing weapons used for murder, or of directing the carrying out a fatal attack' are to be deported to the Gaza Strip or abroad, instead of to Judea, Samaria and eastern Jerusalem. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal, Hamas was supposed to free female civilian hostages before soldiers. One civilian woman, 29-year-old Arbel Yehud, remains in Gaza. It is not clear whether her exclusion from Saturday’s release will complicate the agreement. Shiri Bibas, 33, another female civilian hostage, was taken with her two children, and they are included on the list of the 33 hostages to be released. Hamas, however, claimed in November that they were killed. Three civilian women—Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher—were released last Sunday in return for 90 terrorists (30 for each civilian) shortly after the ceasefire went into effect. Of the hostages whom Hamas kidnapped on Oct. 7, 87 are still in Gaza, including 30 who are believed to be dead. Hamas also holds three additional hostages taken before the 2023 attack.

Israel accepts 4 hostages despite Hamas violating deal	Israel had communicated its expectation that female civilian hostages, including Arbel Yehud, would be prioritized under the agreement. By World Israel News The list of Israeli hostages scheduled for release on Saturday, as announced by Hamas, includes female IDF soldiers Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, and Liri Albag. Although Hamas published the list at 5:00pm, the IDF requested that Israeli media delay publication until the families of the hostages had been notified. The Israeli government, however, has expressed strong reservations regarding the list, citing significant deviations from the terms of the agreed-upon deal. Discussions are now underway between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz, and top security officials on how to address this breach. The Disputed List of Hostages According to an official statement from Netanyahu’s office, the names provided by Hamas do not align with the original agreement. Under the terms of the deal, Hamas was also required to provide information about the status of the 26 remaining hostages who are slated for release in the initial phase. This list would, for the first time, offer official information about the Bibas family—parents Shiri and Yarden, and their children Ariel and Kfir—who have been held in Gaza. Escalating Concerns Over Civilian Hostages A critical point of contention is the inclusion of female civilian hostages in the release schedule. For each female civilian hostage released, the deal stipulates that Israel will free 30 Palestinian prisoners, while 50 prisoners are to be released for each female IDF soldier. Israel had communicated its expectation that female civilian hostages, including Arbel Yehud, would be prioritized under the agreement. However, Yehud’s situation highlights a complication: she is believed to be held by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group rather than Hamas. This has led to concerns in Jerusalem about delays in her release. The agreement outlines a specific sequence for hostage releases. Any deviation from this order has significant implications for the trust and execution of the deal. Israel’s Potential Responses Hamas’ violation of the agreement has placed Israel in a challenging position. The government has a range of options to consider, including withdrawing its commitment to allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza or modifying the list of Palestinian prisoners slated for release. The Palestinian prisoners include individuals serving life sentences for murder and other terror-related offenses, making their release a contentious issue domestically. Any adjustments to the prisoner list could further complicate the fragile negotiations. Next Steps in Negotiations Amid these developments, high-level discussions continue between Netanyahu, his negotiating team, and international mediators. The outcome of these talks will likely shape Israel’s response to Hamas and determine whether the agreement can proceed or if further complications will arise. As tensions remain high, both sides are under pressure to uphold their commitments to the agreement. For Israel, ensuring the safe return of hostages is paramount, while for Hamas, compliance with the terms may impact its standing in the ongoing conflict.

Discussions are now underway between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz, and top security officials on how to address this breach. By World Israel News In a development fraught with tension, Hamas submitted a list of hostages scheduled for release on Saturday afternoon to mediators. The Israeli government, however, has expressed strong reservations regarding the list, citing significant deviations from the terms of the agreed-upon deal. Discussions are now underway between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz, and top security officials on how to address this breach. The Disputed List of Hostages According to an official statement from Netanyahu’s office, the names provided by Hamas do not align with the original agreement. Diplomatic sources revealed that the agreement stipulated that the next release would include three soldiers and one civilian but the names on the list fail to meet this criterion. Consequently, Israel is holding consultations to decide its next steps. Under the terms of the deal, Hamas was also required to provide information about the status of the 26 remaining hostages who are slated for release in the initial phase.

Israeli ambassador Danon slams UN’s silence over Bibas children h...	Danon pointed out the hypocrisy of the UN's intense focus on the fate of children in Gaza and the lack of attention paid to the youngest Israeli hostages. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, criticized the UN Security Council on Thursday for its silence over the plight of the Bibas children still held in Gaza. He pointed out the hypocrisy of the body's focus on the fate of children in Gaza but not one word about the youngest Israeli hostages. 'Why didn't you hold a discussion on the situation of children in Israel?' Danon asked. He added, 'You are blind to their pain and their tears.' Danon held up a picture of Kfir Bibas and said, 'Perhaps you have forgotten about little Kfir Bibas, but I promise you, we haven't.' He continued, 'Kfir Bibas was nine months old when he was ripped from his bed, along with his four-year-old brother, Ariel, and his parents, Shiri and Yarden. He has remained in the darkness of Hamas's terror dungeons.' Since the family was kidnapped on October 7th, 2023, neither the Israeli government nor relatives have received any news about them, including the state of their health. Danon included the Red Cross in his criticism, saying, 'We have received no word, nothing, about [Kfir's] condition. No visits from the Red Cross, no offers of assistance, and no outrage from the UN.' He continued, 'Do you not hear the cries of Israeli children? Do you not feel the pain of Israeli children? Do you not see their tears? If you did, if you cared for anything other than political agendas, this session would discuss Kfir Bibas and all those Israel children still suffering as well.' 'Our children, every single one, deserve more than your silence. They deserve more than your indifference. They deserve their lives back,' Danon said. Danon then pointed out the irony of the UN's intense focus on children in Gaza, when Hamas puts the children of Gaza in danger by embedding terror infrastructure in schools and hospitals, effectively using children as human shields. 'Hamas, not Israel, is the one who turned Gaza into a war zone. Hamas, not Israel, is using children as human shields. Hamas, not Israel, is placing its terror infrastructure in schools, hospitals, and residential neighborhoods. 'When will you do something effective against Hamas to change the future of the children of the world?'

Report: Chinese chemical shipments en route to rebuild Iran’s mis...	The sources didn’t confirm whether the Chinese government knew about the transfers. By Jewish Breaking News Two Iranian vessels loaded with missile-grade chemicals are en route from Chinese ports, raising new questions about Beijing’s role in arming Israel’s greatest adversary. Intelligence officials caught China red-handed supplying Iran’s missile program last week when they tracked the Iranian vessel Golbon loading up with missile fuel precursors at Taicang port near Shanghai. Packed with 34 containers of sodium perchlorate, the ship departed China’s Daishan island on Tuesday. Two sources who leaked the story to the Financial Times estimate that with 1,000 tons of chemical precursor Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps will be able to produce fuel for 260 medium-range missiles. Owned by Iranian entities, the ships are expected to make the three-week voyage to Tehran without making any port calls, which is common for sanction evaders. The sources didn’t confirm whether the Chinese government knew about the transfers. However, Beijing has faced repeated criticism from Washington and its allies for supporting both Iran and Russia. Iran has reportedly moved around 3 million barrels of oil from its Chinese storage reserves last month. According to the Wall Street Journal, the oil came from a massive 25 million barrel stockpile that Iran had stored in China back in 2018, when Tehran feared Trump-era sanctions would block their exports. While Iran had tried to sell this stored oil before, Chinese officials only approved the recent sales after meetings with Iranian representatives in late 2023. Needless to say, the billions to be made from its illegal oil sales could help Iran rebuild its terror networks in the Middle East. With President Donald Trump vowing to tighten the noose, Tehran appears to be racing against time to maximize the little time it has left under Biden’s failed policies. Iran’s infamous shadow tanker fleet grew by 132 vessels last year under Biden’s watch according to United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), pushing their total 'ghost fleet' to 477 ships. While UANI’s intelligence efforts led to over 330 ships losing their flags and helped trigger U.S. sanctions on 139 vessels, Iran still managed to export 587 million barrels through their covert shipping operations in 2024.

GOP-controlled Congress considers bill sanctioning Palestinian go...	The Palestinian government pays around $16 million a month to imprisoned terrorists, including nearly 900 Gaza-based Hamas fighters captured in the wake of Oct. 7, according to estimates. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon The Republican-controlled Congress is moving on legislation that would authorize wide-ranging sanctions on the Palestinian government and any international partner that has aided its terrorist payment program, known as 'pay-to-slay,' according to a copy of the bill obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. Republicans in the House and Senate jointly introduced the bill with broad backing, signaling that the measure is an early priority in both legislative chambers. The legislation would impose sanctions on the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for providing millions of dollars to imprisoned terrorists and their families. It also would sanction any 'foreign persons' known to facilitate these payments or help the Palestinian government administer the program. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) is shepherding the bill in the Senate, with Mike Lawler (R., N.Y.) introducing the House version. Eight Senate Republican leaders, including Texas's Ted Cruz, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, Florida's Rick Scott, North Carolina's Ted Budd, and Tennessee's Bill Hagerty, are also backing the bill. The measure is likely to garner broad support in the GOP-controlled House, which has already moved on separate legislation to sanction the International Criminal Court for its persecution of Israel on the international stage. In the Senate, it would need at least some Democratic support to cross the upper chamber's 60-vote threshold. Both parties overwhelmingly supported a similar 2018 law, the Taylor Force Act, which forced the American government to freeze Palestinian aid until the terrorist payments program ends. The latest bill, dubbed the PLO and PA Terror Payments Accountability Act, builds on the 2018 law by sanctioning not just the Palestinian government but its international enablers, a provision that could impact foreign financial institutions and the United Nations, which provides financial resources to both the PLO and PA. 'Despite the enactment of the Taylor Force Act, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority have continued their system of compensation that incentivizes, encourages, rewards, and supports acts of terrorism,' the bill states. In an attempt to build further pressure on the Palestinian government, the legislation targets a host of affiliated entities that have helped keep cash flowing to imprisoned terrorists. Those entities include: the Commission of Prisoners and Released Prisoners, the Institute for the Care of the Families of the Martyrs and the Wounded, the Palestine National Fund, and the National Association of the Families of the Martyrs of Palestine. Sanctions, meanwhile, would be applied on any foreign financial institution that facilitates transactions on the Palestinian government’s behalf. 'The Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization continue to support terrorism against Israel by providing hundreds of millions of dollars per year in their reprehensible ‘pay-for-slay’ program,' Cotton told the Free Beacon. 'Anti-Semitic Palestinian terrorists know they can expect payment as a reward for killing Israelis and Americans—with thousands of Palestinian terrorists tied to October 7 eligible for these terror payments.' The Palestinian government pays around $16 million a month to imprisoned terrorists, including nearly 900 Gaza-based Hamas fighters captured in the wake of Oct. 7, according to estimates. The Biden State Department, in a private 2022 report obtained by the Free Beacon, determined that the PA allocates hundreds of millions of dollars annually to imprisoned terrorists and their families. The assessment, however, did not stop the administration from funneling millions in taxpayer funds to the Palestinian government, likely in violation of the 2018 Taylor Force Act. Regional observers expect the Trump administration to reassess U.S. funding to the Palestinian government, particularly as the administration shapes a new foreign policy meant to eliminate questionable foreign aid initiatives. President Donald Trump froze aid to the Palestinian Authority during his first term, and the Biden administration restarted it. Lawler said it 'is well past time' Congress puts an end to the pay-to-slay program. 'The PLO and PA Terror Payments Accountability Act will ensure those who finance and enable these horrific acts are held fully accountable,' he said. 'By imposing tough sanctions on those behind these payments, we are delivering a clear and unwavering message: terrorism will not be tolerated or rewarded.' The bill is the first of several pieces of legislation meant to strengthen America’s support for Israel as it winds down more than a year of fighting with Hamas and Hezbollah. The Senate is expected to soon take up legislation that would compel the U.S. government to refer to the 'West Bank ' territory as 'Judea and Samaria,' Israel’s official term for the region, according to congressional sources familiar with the effort. Government documents and communications have long referred to the territory as the 'West Bank,' undermining Israel’s historical ties to the region.

Hamas is ‘making a big comeback’ in Gaza during ceasefire, expert...	Dr. Michael Milshtein: 'From their perspective, the cost (of the Gaza war) was justified. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas is rebuilding in Gaza and, from their own point of view, the terror group is 'making a big comeback,' experts warn. Dr. Michael Milshtein, a senior researcher at the Dayan Center at Tel Aviv University, told 103FM on Thursday that Hamas is using the ceasefire as an opportunity to attempt to reassert its control over Gaza. 'Their situation isn't that bad. It feels terrible to say it, especially since we were hoping to see an organization that was battered, beaten, and barely hanging on,' Milshtein said. He mentioned that Hamas has announced schools re-opening, although 85% of them no longer exist, and a deployment of 6,000 Hamas' police' on the streets. 'We need to understand the mindset of many Palestinians, particularly Hamas. From their perspective, the cost was justified. In their eyes, 50,000 lives lost and the destruction of Gaza are seen as the necessary price for the harm done to Israel and to reclaim their national pride,' Milshtein said. 'I'm not endorsing their views, but this is their narrative, and it's crucial that we recognize it,' he added. Since the ceasefire, Hamas terrorists, who were dressed in regular clothes, are now parading through the streets in Gaza wearing the terror organization's uniforms. Images show Hamas terrorists standing on top of vehicles and brandishing weapons, surrounded by cheering crowds. During the 15-month war with Hamas, Israel dismantled 24 Hamas battalions and killed 20,000-25,000 terrorists. However, Yoni Ben-Menachem, a senior Middle East analyst for the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, said, 'The transfer of many IDF troops to southern Lebanon eased the pressure on Hamas, allowing them a chance to regroup.' He continued, 'This shift enabled Hamas to rebuild, and just last month, they managed to recruit 4,000 new fighters, funded by the sale of humanitarian aid entering Gaza.' 'Hamas is rebuilding, and it's possible that they'll try to maintain control of Gaza. With the ceasefire in place, Hamas has the freedom to act as it wishes, and it has managed to survive militarily,' Ben-Menachem said. He added, 'As of yesterday, 600 trucks carrying aid are entering Gaza daily, marking a significant increase. Hamas will likely exploit this aid by selling it and using the proceeds to recruit more terrorists.'

Nashville school shooter praised Hitler, said he was ‘influenced’...	The shooter, who like Owens is black, also posted a flyer from the Goyim Defense League, an antisemitic hate group which, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), has an 'overarching goal to expel Jews from America.' By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The teenager accused of perpetrating a fatal school shooting in Nashville, Tennessee on Wednesday praised Adolf Hitler, shared neo-Nazi content, and said he was inspired by anti-Israel commentator Candace Owens, according to reports of the alleged shooter’s purported manifesto. Police identified the shooter as Solomon Henderson, a 17-year-old student at Antioch High School, saying he shot and killed Josselin Corea Escalante, who was 16, and wounded two others in the school’s cafeteria before turning the gun on himself. Authorities are also investigating a racist and antisemitic manifesto full of online writings and social media posts that emerged following the shooting that has been attributed to Henderson to determine if the materials were actually the work of the alleged shooter. Multiple local media outlets, including NewsChannel 5 Nashville and The Tennessean newspaper, reported that the documents indicated that the suspect harbored a litany of antisemitic beliefs and drew inspiration from Owens, a far-right media personality. 'Candace Owens has influenced me above all each time she spoke I was stunned by her insights and her own views helped push me further and further into the belief of violence over the Jewish question,' the manifesto reportedly said. Henderson, who like Owens is black, also posted a flyer from the Goyim Defense League, an antisemitic hate group which, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), has an 'overarching goal to expel Jews from America.' The suspect’s purported writings indicate he was mentally deteriorating and suffered from self-loathing. Henderson reportedly wrote that he 'was ashamed to be black.' He also repudiated Antioch High School, which has a heavily Black and Hispanic student body, with the use of derogatory racial terms. The ADL’s Center on Extremism issued an analysis of the document, saying it appears to be authentic. 'Our analysts located a sprawling manifesto full of anti-black content, references to accelerationism, and antisemitism,' Carla Hill of the Center on Extremism, told The Tennessean. 'It also plagiarized from various far-right manifestos and publications, including Terrorgram Collective [a white supremacist group] and a manifesto by Matthew Harris.' Harris, who is black, was arrested in 2022 for threatening a mass shooting against the University of California, Los Angeles, where he had worked as a philosophy instructor. He posted a manifesto that included calls for violence against Jews and white people. In the 15 months since the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Owens has established herself as a fierce critic of the Jewish state who has also been accused of antisemitism. After parting ways with The Daily Wire, a politically conservative media company, last year amid controversy over her comments regarding Jews and Israel, Owens has made those subjects top priorities in her new show. In late July, for example, Owens said that the Star of David originated from an evil, child-sacrificing, pagan deity and has only become associated with Judaism within the past few hundred years. In a June episode, Owens argued that 'it seems like our country [the US] is being held hostage by Israel.' She lamented, 'I’m going to get in so much trouble for that. I don’t care.' She also falsely suggested in the same episode that AIPAC, the foremost pro-Israel lobbying organization in the US, was behind the assassination of former US President John F. Kennedy. Weeks later, Owens promoted a series of talking points downplaying the atrocities of the Holocaust and said experiments by Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele performed on Jews during World War II sounded 'like bizarre propaganda.' In an August interview, Owens claimed that Judaism is a 'pedophile-centric religion that believes in demons … [and] child sacrifice.' She has also suggested without evidence that Israel was established to shield 'pedophiles' from accountability. As a result of her comments, Owens received the 'Antisemite of the Year' award for 2024 from the US-based advocacy group StopAntisemitism. The controversial media personality happily accepted the distinction while stating that the charge of antisemitism no longer maintains 'any real meaning.' Owens then claimed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is actually the most prominent antisemite, because he has 'murdered and killed and maimed more actual Semites this year' than anyone else. Owens issued a statement on Thursday in response to reports noting her name being mentioned in the alleged Nashville shooter’s purported writings. 'It is truly sickening that people would use the death of a young 16-year-old girl to try to quickly score political points, rather than to responsibly make sure that what they are sharing is accurate,' Owens said, calling the manifesto 'an obvious troll.'

Hungarian and Israeli ministers condemn ICC over arrest warrants ...	Saar also updated Peter Szertö on developments in Syria and Lebanon, where a two-month ceasefire with Hezbollah is due to expire on Sunday. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar slammed the International Criminal Court during a joint media appearance in Budapest with his Hungarian counterpart, Peter Szertö on Thursday. 'The politically corrupt International Criminal Court in The Hague has chosen, in an unprecedented manner, to act against a democratic state that is the most attacked and threatened in the world,' said Sa’ar. 'This is an attack on Israel’s right to defend itself.' Szertö backed Israel’s position against the ICC’s issuance of arrest warrants targeting Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Galant. The meeting touched on the specific case of Omri Miran, an Israeli-Hungarian citizen held hostage in Gaza, whose release is expected in the second phase of a ceasefire with Hamas. Saar thanked Szertö for Hungary’s support in securing Miran’s release. Miran, now 47, was taken captive on October 7 from Kibbutz Nahal Oz. The last sign of life came when he appeared in a Hamas propaganda video released in April 2024. The first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how many are alive. Israelis celebrated the return of the first three, Doron Steinbrecher, Romi Gonen and Emily Damari, on Sunday. The fate of the remaining 65 hostages, including Miran, will be determined by negotiations to begin on the 16th day of the ceasefire. Critics say the phased approach condemns hostages not freed in the beginning to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. Saar also updated Szerto on developments in Syria and Lebanon, where a two-month ceasefire with Hezbollah is due to expire on Sunday. Sa’ar also warned of the Houthi threat to Red Sea shipping and urged Budapest to designate the Houthis as a terrorist organization following the U.S. The International Criminal Court issued unprecedented arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in November, the first time warrants have been issued against leaders from a democratic country. Both officials would be liable for arrest if they travel to countries that are party to the ICC. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Deif. Although he was killed in an airstrike in July, Hamas never confirmed Deif’s death. Israel is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction. The ICC charter prohibits the court from prosecuting nationals of countries with independent judiciaries. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 94 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead.

Thai farm workers attacked on Oct. 7 return to Negev farms	Ten foreigners are among the more than 90 hostages, living and dead, still being held by Hamas in Gaza, including eight Thai workers as well as a Nepalese and Tanzanian student. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS A Thai agriculture worker crouched on top of the refrigerator in the small room in the cowshed in the southern kibbutz of Alumim, eyeing the removable ceiling panels for an emergency getaway. It was Oct. 7, 2023, and Hamas terrorists had stormed this agricultural community, less than 2.5 miles from the Gaza border, using guns, hand grenades and a rocket-propelled grenade launcher to attack a group of Thai foreign workers and Nepali agricultural students, killing 22 of them (12 Thai and 10 Nepalese citizens) and abducting others to Gaza. Their mobile caravan dormitories, nearest to the entry point of the terrorists, were adjacent to the cowshed. All had been set ablaze. From his hiding place in the cowshed’s medicine room, Korawit Kaeokoed, 37, who had been milking the cows overnight before the attack got underway, messaged his wife in Thailand that he wouldn’t make it out alive. The cowshed at Kibbutz Alumim after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023. Credit: Courtesy. Back to Thailand Kaeokoed would remain hidden for the next 20 hours, using his sweatshirt, doused with a liquid solution normally used to prevent cows from becoming dehydrated, to cover his mouth to avoid breathing in the smoke that was spreading everywhere. It was only early the next morning that he was rescued by kibbutz members who fought off the terrorist onslaught on this Orthodox village on that fateful autumn day 15 months ago. They managed to stop the invaders from reaching the kibbutz members’ living quarters and prevented a bigger massacre like those that took place in nearby communities. Safe at last, Kaeokoed saw the scorched bodies of friends stretched on the ground outside the cowshed. The following week, he was among 9,000 Thais who returned to their country, out of the nearly 30,000 who were employed in Israel’s agricultural sector before the war. In all, 39 Thai citizens were killed in the Oct. 7 massacres, the third-largest group after Israelis and Americans.

Return Almost all of the Thai workers who left Israel right after the assault have since returned, some like Kaeokoed to the communities that came under attack on Oct. 7. After less than three months at home, he was already back in Israel last January, even as the war against Hamas continued to rage. 'Israel good,' Kaeokoed told JNS on Wednesday at the newly rebuilt cowshed where he had his close encounter with death. 'No work, no money in Thailand,' he added noting that he was glad to be back at the kibbutz supporting his family, who live in the impoverished north of the Southeast Asian country. He vividly remembers everything he went through, showing JNS where he hid and where he had urgently messaged his employer: 'Gaza here, Gaza here,' when he first caught sight of the invader. Unfinished story Ten foreigners are among the more than 90 hostages, living and dead, still being held by Hamas in Gaza, including eight Thai workers as well as a Nepalese and Tanzanian student. Bipin Joshi, the 23-year-old Nepalese student who was abducted from this kibbutz, managed to pick up a terrorist grenade and throw it outside his bomb shelter, before being seized. Last year, the community held a joint memorial for the slain workers and students, as well as the Israelis who were killed fighting off the intrusion, at the site of their former caravans. ‘We are their friends’ For war-scarred kibbutz members, the return of the Thai workers during the war was a heartwarming surprise. 'We were really shocked,' said Gilad Hunwald, 45, who runs the avocado sector at the kibbutz. 'One day, all of a sudden I saw they had returned,' he said. 'I come back,' Kaeokoed told him. 'We are their [the Thais’] friends,' Hunwald told JNS.

The dramatic operations Israel coordinated with the US—and those ...	Throughout the months of fighting, the two countries conducted a complex give-and-take relationship that sometimes spilled over into confrontations, both public and private. By Itay Ilnai, JNS In early September, senior IDF officers were humming the biggest hit by Israeli musician Daniel Solomon, 'So Many Ways.' The military was preparing for a commando operation codenamed 'Many Ways' to destroy a secret precision missile factory that Iran had built on Syrian soil. Fighters from the Israeli Air Force’s Shaldag commando unit, who were to lead the operation, had already packed their equipment and were ready to fly to the target, which was hidden deep underground, not far from the city of Masyaf in Syria’s northwest. The daring operation had been approved by the IAF commander, the IDF chief of staff, the defense minister and the prime minister, and all that remained was the final approval to send the fighters to the helicopters. At that point, the ground maneuver against Hamas in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, was nearing completion, IAF strikes in Lebanon were becoming more efficient, and about a month earlier, Hezbollah’s 'chief of staff' Fuad Shukr had been eliminated in an impressive targeted killing. The political and military leadership in Israel, which had gained confidence as days passed since the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on the northwestern Negev, felt that the time was right to also strike the Iranian missile factory. But there was one thing that worried decision-makers in Jerusalem before they would approve the Shaldag operation in the heart of Syria: the Biden administration. IDF troops operating in an underground missile factory in Syria. (IDF) ‘A clear no-go‘ In fact, America had worried Israeli decision-makers from the very first moment of the war, and vice versa. Throughout the months of fighting, the two countries conducted a complex give-and-take relationship that sometimes spilled over into confrontations, both public and private. 'It was really like a tug of war,' an Israeli source who was deeply involved in the feverish contacts with Washington, told Israel Hayom. 'The problem was that by the time of the proposed Shaldag operation in Syria, the rope with the U.S. was stretched to the limit. 'The main thing the U.S. feared throughout was opening a front against Iran and deteriorating into an all-out war. The key word in this aspect was stability. … 'You can’t tell the Americans, ‘Listen, we’re in trouble in Gaza and Lebanon, war with Iran is about to break out, so we decided to also carry out a raid deep in Syria.’ From their perspective, it was a clear no-go,' said the source. He was not the only one who thought so. In the days before the operation, just by chance, a senior Israeli official met IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and whispered words of warning in his ear. That official, who had visited the White House a few days earlier and sensed which way the winds were blowing there, told the chief of staff privately that if Israel carried out the operation without getting U.S. approval in advance, 'it would be the point of no return in relations with them.' Halevi also believed that there was no choice but to coordinate the operation with the Americans. Beyond the fear of severing ties with the White House, the action was to take place deep in Syrian territory. If something went wrong, Halevi knew, the Americans would be the only ones who could help. The solution to the dilemma, as always throughout the Israeli-American roller coaster during the war, focused on presentation: In coordination between the political and military echelons in Israel, it was decided that the one who would inform the Americans about the operation would be the chief of staff. The recipient of the news on the other side would be his good friend, CENTCOM commander Gen. Michael Kurilla. Reassuring messages It was not by chance that the sensitive task was assigned to Halevi. It stemmed from the assumption that the IDF chief of staff was perceived in the White House as a moderate and level-headed figure, who acts out of practical motives and himself prefers to avoid escalation with Iran. 'The military, and the chief of staff in particular, are perceived by the Americans as the sane element in Israel,' an Israeli source puts it. But more important, a professional relationship developed between Halevi and Kurilla throughout the months of the Swords of Iron/Northern Arrows war that evolved into a close friendship. During the war, Kurilla visited Israel 15 times, and often sat down for a heart-to-heart talk with Halevi in the chief of staff’s office on the 14th floor of the General Staff tower at the Kirya military headquarters, on the couches overlooking Tel Aviv’s skyline. The two battle-hardened generals probably will never admit it, but a source who knows both of them describes the friendship between them with a very non-military word—love. Israel sought to take advantage of this love. With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s approval, Halevi met privately with Kurilla, updated his American counterpart on the details of the operation in Syria and its necessity, reassured him about opening a front against Iran, and asked him to gently convey the message to his bosses in Washington. Halevi emphasized that the missiles Iran was producing near Masyaf could reach all parts of the Middle East and one day hit American bases. Kurilla proved, and not for the first time, his diplomatic abilities. The American general prepared CENTCOM forces for the operation in Syria, and did so under Tehran’s radar, and to a large extent also under Washington’s. Only at the right moment, according to sources in Israel, did Kurilla update Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and the White House on all the details of the operation, while repeating the reassuring messages conveyed to him by IDF Chief of Staff Halevi. The White House was persuaded not to thwart the action in Syria. The rest is history. Divide and conquer The case of 'Operation Many Ways' is just one expression of how the relationship between Israel and the U.S. was conducted during the war. On the one hand, cooperation between the sides reached the level of unequivocal American support for Israel, meticulous approval of Israeli attack plans by American officials, and personal involvement of senior White House officials in Israeli Cabinet meetings and General Staff forums, as had not been seen before. On the other hand, Israel-U.S. relations during the war did not proceed smoothly or in perfect harmony, far from it. There were also cases where Israel launched critical operations without updating the U.S in advance—such as in the case of the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah—or carried out moves contrary to the White House’s clear position and aroused its anger, such as the entry into Rafah. More than once, passionate arguments erupted between the sides that escalated to shouting and even cursing. 'He’s a f****** liar,' U.S. President Joe Biden said about Netanyahu after Israel entered Rafah by ground, according to an American report. Despite these disagreements, some of which delayed war moves, from Netanyahu’s perspective, the continued American support for Israel was a priceless gift. Conversations with a long line of sources reveal that the entire Israeli political and security leadership, from the prime minister down, was and remains in agreement that without backing from the Biden administration, Israel would have been forced to stop the war before achieving all its goals. Beyond the American armaments that crossed the Atlantic Ocean and enabled the continuation of IDF attacks in Gaza and Lebanon, the most important thing from Israel’s perspective was America’s position in the U.N. Security Council and its ability to veto any resolution that would effectively end the war. 'Contrary to popular opinion in Israel, without the Americans, we would have closed this war long ago,' as a senior Israeli official puts it. 'That’s why we had to tread carefully with them and walk on eggshells.' Those shells were particularly fragile. The war broke out with Biden in the White House, whose interests did not always align with Israel’s offensive approach, or as a senior Israeli bluntly puts it: 'The Democratic administration is anti-combat.' As fate would have it, the war took place in a U.S. election year, in which Biden was under pressure from elements in the Democratic Party who were shocked by the images of destruction streaming from the Gaza Strip, and called for reducing support for Israel and immediately stopping the war. Israel, therefore, had to navigate the political thicket of Washington, while stretching the American rope to the limit without breaking it. This juggling act relied on personal connections forged between senior Israelis and Americans, careful listening to the nuances of administration officials, and a deep understanding of the decision-making system in Washington. The Americans also knew how to employ divide-and-conquer tactics. They, for example, drew closer to former Minister Benny Gantz, and later to former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, assuming they could help them exert pressure on Netanyahu and within the Cabinet. The Americans also knew when to call on senior IDF officers for help, especially the chief of staff, when they lost trust in Israeli politicians. 'There were times when U.S. Secretary of State Blinken arrived in the country and the chief of staff asked to brief him, but Netanyahu blocked it,' says an Israeli source. 'But Blinken almost always insisted that Herzi come to meet with him, and so it was. He trusted Herzi.' Halevi, in a sense, became the White House’s Kurilla. The Dermer axis Only just before the Biden administration gave way to that of Donald Trump did those in Israel’s political and military system allow themselves to reveal the behind-the-scenes of managing contacts with Washington. This Israel Hayom investigation, based on hours of in-depth conversations with those who were at the center of decision-making in Israel, seeks to map out the complex web of relations between Israel and the U.S. as it developed during the war and behind closed doors. 'If you judge it now in retrospect after 15 months, I don’t see a single move we wanted to make that didn’t happen in the end,' said an enthusiastic Israeli source who was deeply involved in the ties with Washington. It seems that indeed, Israel managed the fragile relations with big sister America efficiently. An in-depth look at the web of relations between the countries reveals that even if things often slid into ego battles and credit levels within the Israeli system, the relationship between Jerusalem and Washington was conducted throughout the war in a kind of chaotic synergy that proved its effectiveness. The central figure in this aspect is Ron Dermer, Netanyahu’s ultimate confidant, who is officially defined as minister for strategic affairs but in practice serves as Netanyahu’s long arm for American affairs. The experienced Dermer learned well how to stretch the rope with Washington to the limit, especially with Democratic administrations. Throughout the Oct. 7 war, it seems that Dermer was the central axis who managed the relationship with America for Netanyahu, especially with the White House. He spoke regularly with Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and White House envoy to the Middle East Brett McGurk, and shuttled between Washington and Jerusalem to grease the squeaky wheels between the capitals, while leveraging his deep familiarity with the American system. 'Dermer knows how to confront the U.S., manage crises with it,' said a senior Israeli source privy to the matters. 'Dermer and Netanyahu were not willing to accept any dictates from the Americans, but where possible, they did accommodate them. Israel and the U.S. may not have been on the same paragraph throughout the war, but Dermer made sure they always remained on the same page.' Message to Hezbollah The relationship between Israel and the U.S. shadows all the main events of the war. Already in the evening hours of Oct. 7, 2023, Halevi called Kurilla and updated him on what was happening. Halevi did not have to beg for help. Kurilla offered it on his own initiative. 'What do you need?' he asked. The Israeli chief of staff explained to his counterpart that he was mainly worried that Hezbollah would raise its head and join Hamas in a ground attack on the northern border. 'If you have an aircraft carrier of yours in the Mediterranean, and if American planes take off from their bases in the Middle East and patrol along Lebanon’s coastline, that could help,' Halevi said. Kurilla promised to check what he could do. In parallel, Netanyahu conveyed identical messages to Sullivan, and later that day also spoke with Biden. 'Israel will win the war against Hamas,' Netanyahu told the president, 'But Hezbollah needs to get the message from the U.S.: ‘Don’t enter the war.’' Another figure who maintained telephone contact with Washington is Gallant, who spoke with his counterpart Austin. During the war, these two men would ultimately speak by phone about 200 times and meet on four occasions. The two former generals would find a common language. In the first days of the war, the Americans significantly reinforced their forces in the Middle East and sent two aircraft carriers to the region. 'The American actions definitely helped,' said a senior Israeli. But even if Hezbollah initially remained on the fence and contented itself with bombarding Israel from afar, in Israel, they knew that one or two aircraft carriers would not suffice in the long run. In the first meetings of the War Cabinet, the chief of staff estimated it would take the IDF about a year to defeat Hamas’s 'military' wing, and that for this he would need a lot of resources. As Halevi phrased it, the U.S. was the main factor that would drive the wheels of Israel’s 'war economy.' Indeed, during the war, the U.S. would transfer more precision munitions to Israel than in all the previous 15 years combined, along with many additional systems. The chief of staff knew he could not afford to lose this supply line. At times, this almost happened. ‘We had no partner’ What began on the right foot nearly came to a blow-up very quickly. On Oct. 10, three days after Hamas’s surprise attack, discussions were held in Israel about launching a preemptive strike in Lebanon. The IDF had already built a plan to inflict extensive damage on Hezbollah’s rocket array (most of the organization’s missiles were still in warehouses at the time, which made hitting them en masse easier), and one piece of intelligence that reached military intelligence contributed another coveted target to the attack. On the afternoon of Oct. 11, 2023, senior Hezbollah officials were scheduled to meet, including Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, his deputy Hashem Safieddine and the commander of the organization’s Southern Lebanon sector Ibrahim Aqil (all of whom would eventually be killed), with three senior officials of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. It was a golden opportunity. The possibility of eliminating Hezbollah’s leadership appealed to Halevi and Gallant. The two men also estimated that if they launched an extensive attack in Lebanon, about 15,000 Hezbollah operatives would receive orders to move to the front and equip themselves with emergency communication devices, a plan well known to the intelligence community in Israel. Those communication devices, as Gallant and Halevi already knew then, were booby-trapped and could explode on command. Such an order, if given at the right time, could deliver a decisive blow to the organization (in the end, the communication devices would explode about a year later, when most were in warehouses and not on the bodies of Hezbollah members). On the morning of Oct. 11, Gallant presented the detailed plan in Netanyahu’s office in Tel Aviv, and spoke about restoring Israeli deterrence and creating a strategic advantage for the continuation of the war. The prime minister seemed to Gallant to be depressed and pessimistic. 'If you attack Hezbollah,' Netanyahu said and pointed beyond the window pane, 'all these buildings will collapse from their counter-response.' Call with Biden Gallant continued to try, but Netanyahu was not convinced. 'Before we do this, I want to talk to the [U.S.] president,' the prime minister finally told the defense minister. Gallant knew at that moment that the attack would not go ahead: He felt that Netanyahu was seeking to use the U.S., and its tendency to avoid escalations, to thwart the attack in Lebanon. While Netanyahu waited for his call with Biden, Gallant and Dermer entered an office, and at one o’clock in the afternoon called from there to Sullivan, the person closest to Biden. When Sullivan heard about the Israeli plan, as expected, he asked the Israeli ministers to wait. 'I need to talk about this with the president.' The problem was that the meeting of Hezbollah’s leadership was scheduled to take place in a few hours. There was not much time left to make the decision. In another channel, Halevi also tried in his way to convince Biden to support launching an attack in Lebanon. Halevi believed that if he just clearly explained to the president why Israel needed to attack, Biden would accede to the request. Halevi would discover, perhaps for the first time but certainly not the last, that it’s not easy to convince Biden to go on the offensive. 'If Mike Pompeo [Trump’s secretary of state] was still in office, I would have told him, ‘Let’s go for this move together,’ and we would have had a partner,' said a source who was involved then in Cabinet discussions. 'But in the Biden administration, we had no partner.' Halevi and Gallant were indeed determined to launch the attack in Lebanon even without approval from Biden—'What do we have an army for if not to use it,' Gallant pounded on the Cabinet table—but they did not have a majority. Netanyahu and Dermer, along with Gantz and former IDF chief of staff Gadi Eizenkot, who were added to the War Cabinet that evening, voted against the attack and cited their fear of opening another front in the north and the lack of American support. Dermer emphasized that he was willing to go after Lebanon without the White House, but not without Israeli unity—and the preemptive strike was finally taken off the table. The one most disappointed by this was Gallant. 'I told you we should have attacked Lebanon first, finished the war against the stronger Hezbollah, and only then moved on to the weaker enemy, Hamas,' he said bitterly in almost every Cabinet meeting throughout the war. The Democratic primaries Throughout the first stage of the war in Gaza, the Americans pressed, time after time, to increase humanitarian aid to the Strip, especially due to the growing pressure on Biden from within the Democratic Party ahead of the presidential primaries. After the IDF moved into Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip, and while American patience was running out and even threatening the continuation of the fighting, Israel had to make a decision: It was clear to the IDF that the next move should be a ground entry into Rafah in Gaza and in Lebanon. However, various considerations caused the military to recommend to the Cabinet to choose only one of the two arenas. 'It wasn’t possible to enter Rafah and Lebanon with full force simultaneously,' said an Israeli source. 'In the end, the decision was to go to Rafah.' This was not going to be simple. According to a source who was involved in contacts with the U.S. ahead of the entry into Rafah, 'Rafah was an excruciating tango dance of several weeks' with the Americans. 'There’s no doubt this was the biggest clash with them during the war,' another senior Israeli said.

‘F**k Netanyahu’ – Senior UN official publicly curses Israeli PM	Pro-Hamas United Nations health official curses Israeli prime minister after Gaza ceasefire delayed for hours over Hamas refusal to handover hostage list; launches into racist tirade against Jewish head of UN monitor group. By World Israel News Staff A radical anti-Israel United Nations official with a history of pro-Hamas rhetoric publicly cursed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week, after Hamas' refusal to provide Israel with a list of hostages slated for release led to the delayed implementation of the Gaza ceasefire. Tlaleng Mofokeng, a South African physician serving as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health, blasted Netanyahu Sunday, after the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip was briefly delayed, following Hamas' failure to handover a list of hostages set for release later that day. The ceasefire, which had been set to go into effect at 8:30 a.m., was delayed until 11:15 a.m.. 'F**k him,' Mofokeng tweeted Sunday, in response to an Al Jazeera article on the delay. A day later, Mofokeng launched into a racist tirade spanning multiple posts after Hillel Neuer, the Director-General of the NGO UN Watch, condemned Mofokeng's comments on Netanyahu and criticized the failure of senior UN leaders to respond. 'The absolute nerve to still be harassing UNRWA at this stage is astounding,' Mofokeng wrote in a tweet aimed at Neuer. 'You are an evil man you bastard. Then they gloat about presenting to the Swiss to ensure they defund as punishment UNRWA. Evil scum. Enjoy your testimony.' Mofokeng repeatedly lambasted Neuer while referring to him as 'that white man.' 'If you know that white man who is presenting to the Swiss house about defunding UNRWA, tell him to get my name out of his filthy mouth.' 'My fave is that same white man posts but limits his comments to his followers. So you’re a silly little loser too. Can’t even say shit with your chest. Big mouth but scared to leave your section open for comment. I’d still be watching you but it’s the cowardliness it is fitting.' After stirring criticism with her comments, Mofokeng defend her online behavior, writing that she was 'influenced' by the pain of the Gaza war. 'The loss of life and devastation in Gaza is heartbreaking and deeply personal for those of us engaged in human rights work. I am in touch with victims of the violence everyday and grieve deeply for those detained & killed and the destruction of the health infrastructure in Gaza.' 'The tone of my communications online and offline are influenced by this pain and grief. In this critical juncture, between heartache and hope, I remain committed to fostering thoughtful and respectful dialogue, particularly on matters as urgent and sensitive as human rights.' Elsewhere, Mofokeng has denied that Hamas is a terrorist organization, called for sanctions against Israel and the diplomatic isolation of the Jewish state, and tweeted that 'Israel must pay.' On Monday, Mofokeng tweeted an anti-Israel slogan widely perceived as endorsing the destruction of the Jewish state. 'From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free. 'RESIST. RESIST. RESIST,' Mofokeng wrote in a separate tweet. 'Peace follows liberation.'

It would be nice' to resolve Iranian nuclear crisis without Israeli strikes, President Trump says, refusing to answer whether he would back IDF attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump refused to say whether not he would support Israeli airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, declining a direct question by a reporter on the subject. The president fielded questions from reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on Thursday, following reports that Trump is poised to tap his special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to handle talks with Iran regarding the rogue Islamic state's nuclear program. Witkoff has led Trump's efforts to secure and maintain a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, beginning his efforts in Doha, Qatar even before President Trump's inauguration this Monday. Trump refused to answer a question posed by a reporter in the Oval Office Thursday as to whether he would back or oppose an Israeli air campaign targeting Iran's nuclear program. 'I'm not going to answer that,' Trump responded, while saying that he would be discussing the issue with top aides in the near future. Trump added that he would prefer the Iranian nuclear crisis be resolved 'without&#8230;that further step.' 'I'm going to be meeting with various people over the next couple of days. We'll see. But hopefully, that can be worked out without having to worry about it.' 'It would really be nice if that could be worked out without having to go that further step.' When pressed to provide details regarding with whom he plans to discuss the issue, Trump said only that he planned to meet with 'very high level people.' 'Look, Iran hopefully will make a deal, and if they don't make a deal, I guess that's okay, too.'

Israeli interior minister: Shin Bet overturned decision to deny T...	The terrorist was transferred for questioning to security officials, who allowed him to enter Israel. By JNS Staff The foreign national who wounded four people in a terrorist stabbing spree in Tel Aviv was initially denied entry to Israel, but security officials overruled that decision, Interior Minister Moshe Arbel said on Tuesday. 'I commend and appreciate the border inspectors of the Population and Immigration Authority, who recognized [the threat] and had sought to prevent the entry into Israel of the terrorist of the Tel Aviv attack in real time upon his arrival at Ben-Gurion Airport on Jan. 18,' stated Arbel. According to Arbel, the terrorist was 'transferred for questioning to security officials, who unfortunately allowed him to enter Israel.' He urged Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) chief Ronen Bar 'to probe this serious incident and draw lessons from it as soon as possible.' The Israel Security Agency subsequently issued a statement confirming that it was investigating, noting that the assailant 'underwent a security assessment that included interrogations as well as additional checks, at the end of which it was decided that there was no data that would establish grounds to prevent his entry into Israel for security reasons.' The attacker, a 29-year-old man identified via an ID card found on his person, was reportedly a U.S. permanent resident born in Morocco. He was shot and killed at the scene by Israeli security personnel in the area. Israel’s Channel 12 reported that the terrorist was in the United States on a DV-1 visa, suggesting that he obtained a Green Card in the Diversity Visa Program that U.S. President Donald Trump has attempted to end. Israel’s Ynet news outlet said the terrorist, identified as Kaddi Abdelaziz, had shared anti-Israel content on Facebook. In one post, he reportedly accused the Jewish state of starving civilians in northern Gaza, claiming that half a million Palestinians were 'at risk of dying from hunger.' Abdelaziz also shared a video praising Islam accompanied by the slogan 'Free Palestine,' as well as a photo of slain terrorist Ibrahim al-Nabulsi. Following the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led massacre, Abdelaziz was said to have shared a post referring to the terror attack as a potential reason for 'doubling the number of martyrs for Islam.' His Facebook profile was deleted shortly after his identity was first published in the media. The U.S. State Department told Ynet on Tuesday night that it was 'aware of the reports' that a Green Card holder was involved, and conveyed 'its deepest condolences to the victims and the families of all those injured.' A spokesperson for the Immigration and Population Authority told JNS on Wednesday that the terrorist did not enter Israel through the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, but applied for a visa using his non-U.S. passport. Israel was admitted to the Visa Waiver Program in 2023, making it the first Middle Eastern nation with reciprocal, visa-free travel to America. Jerusalem had sought acceptance into the Visa Waiver Program for decades. One of the issues holding up its admittance had been the requirement that Israeli authorities treat all U.S. citizens equally, including Palestinian Arabs who hold American citizenship.

Report: IDF was aware of ‘unusual’ Hamas activity hours before Oc...	The decision not to brace for a possible assault was made by 'wide consensus' across the Military Intelligence Directorate and the broader army. By JNS Staff The Israel Defense Forces detected preparations for Hamas rocket fire and other 'unusual activity' in the Gaza Strip on the eve of the Oct. 7, 2023 cross-border massacre but decided not to raise the alert level, according to intelligence documents cited by Ynet on Thursday. The decision not to brace for a possible assault was made by 'wide consensus' across the Military Intelligence Directorate and the broader army, according to the report. This was part of an attempt to avoid burning sources, amid other 'calming indications' suggesting that Hamas was merely preparing an exercise. The information was reportedly included in official records seen by top government and security officials and presented in their arguments in favor of the resignation of IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. Halevi announced his resignation on Tuesday, citing his 'responsibility for the IDF’s failure' during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 massacre, in which Gaza terrorists murdered some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. At 2 a.m. on Oct. 7, the Israeli Air Force command center was informed of unusual activity in the Hamas aerial units, according to Ynet. At the same time, additional indications of preparations for rocket launches were reported. The alarming signs were reportedly discussed in a phone conversation that included OC Southern Command Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and senior IDF officers, as well as representatives of the air force and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet). The chief of Military Intelligence and the head of the IAF, Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar, did not participate, according to the report. OC Operations Directorate Maj. Gen. Oded Basyuk was updated on the call and ordered some action to be taken. 'After consulting with the deputy head of Shin Bet, the commander of Southern Command, the operations commander and the intelligence research department chief, there are three possible scenarios,' Basyuk wrote according to files obtained by the Hebrew outlet. The three scenarios he outlined according to the report were a Hamas drill, preparations by the terrorist group to defend against an IDF assault, or preparations 'for an operation against Israel in the coming hours, including incursion from the sea or a strike on the gas rig, breaching the border, abduction, shooting attack, rocket attack or an aerial incursion.' Basyuk reportedly ordered a review of Israel’s aerial defenses around the gas rig, but concluded that 'there must be careful preparation to protect sensitive sources and coordinate actions with Military Intelligence.' Halevi was said to have held consultations with Basyuk and Finkelman at 4 a.m., after which he ordered an aerial surveillance mission, arguing that even if Hamas was conducting a drill, it would be an opportunity to gather intel. The chief of staff scheduled a meeting with some senior commanders at 8:30 a.m. 'barring significant developments,' according to Ynet. Around 6:30 a.m., air-raid sirens were activated warning of significant rocket fire from Gaza, followed by a ground assault led by some 3,800 terrorists of Hamas’s Nukhba forces, who headed the invasion, as well as 2,200 other terrorists and looters from the coastal enclave. The IDF’s Spokesperson’s Unit told Ynet that the files it had obtained were not part of the official probe into the Oct. 7 failure, which is ongoing. 'The IDF will complete its inquiries into the Oct. 7 massacre in the coming weeks and will present its findings to the public,' it said. In January 2024, Israel’s Walla news outlet cited military sources as claiming that while the IDF was aware of Hamas’s repeated attempts to blow up the security fence on the Gaza border in preparation for the Oct. 7 attacks, it opted to dismiss the rehearsals as a 'provocation.' An intelligence document compiled by the Gaza Division some three weeks before Oct. 7 warned that the Iranian-backed terror group was preparing for an attack in which at least 200 captives would be taken. It was revealed in February that hours before Hamas launched its attack, IDF intelligence learned that hundreds of terrorists in Gaza had activated Israeli SIM cards in their phones. The activations were detected around midnight on the night of Oct. 6, six and a half hours before terrorists breached the border fence. In October, The New York Times reported that Unit 8200, the military’s elite signals intelligence unit, stopped listening to Hamas’s handheld radios a year before the attacks, deciding it was a 'waste of effort.'

Harvest smarter, not harder: Israeli machine learning meets tomat...	This innovative approach offers a cost-effective, non-invasive method to predict critical quality parameters of tomatoes, including weight, firmness, and lycopene content, long before harvest, the researchers said. By Pesach Benson, TPS Revolutionizing harvesting, Israeli researchers harnessed artificial intelligence and technology to offer a cost-effective and non-invasive way to predict the quality parameters of tomatoes. Led by Dr. David Helman of Hebrew University in collaboration with Bar-Ilan University and the Volcani Institute – Agricultural Research Organization, the researchers used a handheld hyperspectral camera to get detailed insights into tomatoes, then used machine learning algorithms to process the data. The team found the results were remarkably accurate. 'Our research aims to bridge the gap between advanced imaging technology, AI, and practical agricultural applications,' said Helman. 'This work has the potential to revolutionize quality monitoring not only in tomatoes but also in other crops. Our next step is to build a low-cost device, ToMAI-SENS, for use across the fruit value chain, from farms to consumers.' This innovative approach offers a cost-effective, non-invasive method to predict critical quality parameters of tomatoes, including weight, firmness, and lycopene content, long before harvest, the researchers said. The study’s findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture. Using a hyperspectral camera, the team analyzed 567 tomatoes from five different cultivars. Hyperspectral imaging captures light across various spectral bands, enabling detailed insights into the physical and chemical properties of the fruit. Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks processed this data to predict seven essential parameters, including total soluble solids, citric acid, ascorbic acid, and pH. One key breakthrough was the efficiency of band selection. By requiring only five spectral bands for accurate predictions, the model opens the door to developing affordable, portable devices for widespread use. The technology can be adapted for other produce and opens up the possibility of farmers monitoring produce quality during the ripening stages, enabling optimal harvest timing and enhancing crop quality.

US security firm prepares to enter Gaza ahead of Palestinians’ re...	Funding for the coalition does not come from Jerusalem but is managed by the countries that mediated the agreement with Hamas: Qatar, Egypt, and the United States, with Doha believed to be providing most of the funds. By JNS Preparations are underway for a U.S. security firm to start inspecting vehicles returning to the northern Gaza Strip through the Netzarim Corridor next week in accordance with the Hamas-Israel ceasefire agreement, the Ynet news outlet reported on Thursday afternoon. Representatives of the company, which employs approximately 100 former military and CIA operatives, arrived in the Jewish state in recent days ahead of a pilot set to kick off on Sunday, according to the report. An international consortium has been established to facilitate the safe return of Palestinians to northern Gaza, according to Ynet. Participants include Safe Reach Solutions (SRS), a logistics planning and operations firm; UG Solutions, which provides integrated security solutions; and an unnamed Egyptian security and inspection company. Funding for the coalition does not come from Jerusalem but is managed by the countries that mediated the agreement with Hamas: Qatar, Egypt and the United States. Doha is believed to be providing most of the funds. According to the terms of the deal between the Jewish state and the Palestinian terror group, seven days after the Jan. 19 implementation of the agreement, noncombatants will be allowed to return to the northern Strip by foot, without weapons or security checks, via Al-Rashid Street. Vehicles may also return northward via the Netzarim Corridor on the seventh day, subject to inspection by the private security company, which was selected by the mediators and coordinated with Israel. On day 22 of the deal, unarmed Palestinians will be allowed to return to the northern Strip on foot via Salah a-Din road, also without inspection. Earlier this week, the Israel Defense Forces reiterated that Palestinians will be allowed to return northwards if Hamas adheres to the ceasefire.

Netanyahu defends Elon Musk amid Nazi salute accusations	Israel's prime minister calls tech mogul and US DOGE administrator Elon Musk a 'great friend of Israel,' pushing back against criticism of the billionaire over gesture some compared to Hitler salute. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly defended South African-born billionaire Elon Musk on Thursday, after the tech mogul and administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Donald Trump was accused of making a Nazi salute at an inauguration event Monday. Raising his arm to wave to the crowd twice during the event, critics quickly compared Musk's gesture to the Nazi salute. 'For the record, the distance between Trump declaring that he was saved by God to make America great again & Musk delivering the Hitler salute was less than 4 hours,' tweeted Steve Schmidt, a former Republican campaign official who left the party in 2018, becoming a vocal Trump critic. Some lawmakers, including New York Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler, accused Musk of antisemitism. 'This abhorrent gesture has no place in our society and belongs in the darkest chapters of human history,' Nadler tweeted. 'I urge all of my colleagues to unite in condemning this hateful gesture for what it is: antisemitism.' The Anti-Defamation League, which has criticized Musk in the past, rejected the comparison, however, calling the movement an 'awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm.' On Thursday, Musk posted a brief comment to his X/Twitter account, pushing back on the 'radical leftists' comparing his gesture to the Nazi salute, noting support on the far-left for the virulently antisemitic Hamas terror organization. 'The radical leftists are really upset that they had to take time out of their busy day praising Hamas to call me a Nazi.' Hours later, Prime Minister Netanyahu used his personal X account to defend Musk from accusations of antisemitism. 'Elon Musk is being falsely smeared,' Netanyahu tweeted. 'Elon is a great friend of Israel. He visited Israel after the October 7 massacre in which Hamas terrorists committed the worst atrocity against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.' 'He has since repeatedly and forcefully supported Israel’s right to defend itself against genocidal terrorists and regimes who seek to annihilate the one and only Jewish state.'

Iranian vice president denies Tehran had foreknowledge of Hamas' invasion of Israel, distancing itself from the attacks and suggesting they hurt Iran's interests. By World Israel News Staff A top Iranian official on Wednesday denied that Tehran had foreknowledge of Hamas' invasion of Israel on October 7th, 2023, and distanced his government from the attacks, suggesting they had negative repercussions for Iran. Iranian Vice President Mohammad Javad Zarif, who formerly served as Foreign Minister, spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday, discussing the ongoing stalemate of Iran's nuclear program, its ties to Hamas, and the impact of the October 7th invasion of Israel on Iran. Zarif reiterated previous claims by Iranian leaders that Tehran was unaware of Hamas' plans to invade Israel, and even suggested that the attacks were detrimental to Iran's foreign policy. 'We did not know about October 7,' Zarif said. 'We were supposed to have a meeting with the Americans on JCPOA renewal on October 9, which was undermined and destroyed by this operation.' 'Tehran's allies in the region, including Hamas, have always worked for their own cause, even at our expense,' Zarif continued. 'We never tried to cash [in on] our investment in the region.' Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made similar comments days after October 7th, denying any connection with the attacks, while appearing to laud Hamas, a long-time Iranian proxy. During his address on Wednesday, Zarif - who was instrumental in crafting the 2015 Iran nuclear deal while serving as foreign minister - denied Tehran has any ambitions for obtaining atomic weapons. 'Had we wanted to build a nuclear weapon, we could have done it a long time ago. But a program to build nuclear weapons is not going to be like our program.' Zarif said he hoped the new American president will 'choose rationality' during his second term in office and 'be more serious, more focused, more realistic.'

Trump puts Houthis back on terror blacklist	Former president Joe Biden had removed the Iran-backed group's Foreign Terrorist Organization designation right after assuming office. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that will put the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen back onto the government’s Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) blacklist. The order 'directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with others, to recommend the re-designation of the Houthis within 30 days.' In explaining the reasoning for the re-designation, the White House said that 'As a result of the Biden administration’s weak policy, the Houthis have fired at U.S. Navy warships dozens of times, launched numerous attacks on civilian infrastructure in partner nations, and attacked commercial vessels transiting Bab al-Mandeb more than 100 times.' 'It is now the policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the Houthis’ capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and thereby end their attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea,' the statement added. Trump had put the organization, officially named Ansar Allah, on the list of the most seriously proscribed terrorists as one of his final acts in office in January 2021. The new Biden administration immediately reversed the decision. It did not take further action even as the Houthis began supporting Hamas in its war with Israel by firing over 300 drones and missiles at the Jewish state. More important to the world at large, the Islamists also began launching missiles at cargo ships in international shipping lanes that were headed toward the Jewish state and the Suez Canal, as well as at Western military ships that started patrolling the lanes to protect them. They also seized several ships and held their crews captive for months at a time. These acts of war forced most companies to avoid the area and travel much further distances to get their products – mostly oil – to their customers in Europe, thus creating backlogs on production lines and raising prices. While the U.S. and Great Britain bombed Houthi sites in Yemen several times over the past year, this did not deter the terrorists. The Israeli air force has also struck military infrastructure sites, including power stations and ports held by the Shiite rebel group that is in control of large areas of the Muslim country. Last week, outgoing president Joe Biden labeled the group a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). This is not as serious a designation, as, for example, individuals affiliated with an FTO are automatically barred from entering the U.S., whereas this does not apply to those on the SDGT list. Trump’s order also 'directs the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Secretary of State to jointly review United Nations partners, nongovernmental organizations, and contractors operating in Yemen.' 'Following this review, the President will direct USAID to end its relationship with entities that have made payments to the Houthis, or which have opposed international efforts to counter the Houthis while turning a blind eye towards the Houthis’ terrorism and abuses,' the White House statement concluded.

Israel demands Arbel Yehud be among next wave of hostages release...	Under the agreement, Hamas is expected to provide the names of the four female hostages to be freed by Friday, a day before their scheduled release. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israel is insisting that 29-year-old Arbel Yehud be among the second group of hostages released by Hamas as part of the ceasefire agreement with the terrorist group, according to Hebrew media reports. Three civilian women were released after the ceasefire went into effect on Sunday. Yehud was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023, and is reportedly being held in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, by a Salafi group affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The deal prioritizes the release of living female civilians, and Israel insists on strict adherence to its terms. We are counting the days, soon we will also count the hours and minutes.We are waiting for you, dear girl.Hold on a little longerArbel Yehud@Bring_Daughters pic.twitter.com/c6abDVf6go &mdash; armandoparlati_BRING_THEM_HOME (@armandoparlati) January 22, 2025 Under the agreement, Hamas is expected to provide the names of the four female hostages to be freed by Friday, a day before their scheduled release. Yehud’s brother Dolev was murdered on Oct. 7, and her partner and some of her relatives were abducted. Some have since been freed. A space exploration enthusiast, Yehud previously worked as an instructor on the subject in the Eshkol Regional Council. Yehud is among seven remaining female hostages from the original list of 33 to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire, including civilian Shiri Silberman Bibas and five soldiers: Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Danielle Gilboa and Naama Levy. For each soldier released, Israel is to release 50 Palestinian prisoners, including convicted terrorists.

Hamas accused of diverting aid as over 2,400 trucks enter Gaza	The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that 897 aid trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday alone. By JNS Despite over 2,400 aid trucks having entered the Gaza Strip since the Israel-Hamas ceasefire on Sunday, Gaza residents say the aid is not reaching them. They are accusing Hamas of diverting it and selling it, Hebrew media reported on Thursday. 'We don’t see any aid or goods at reasonable prices. Why?' lamented one resident, according to Channel 12 News. Another said, 'Hamas steals the aid and sells it to merchants, who then set exorbitant prices at the expense of our entire people.' The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that 897 aid trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday alone, following 630 on Sunday and 915 on Monday. The ceasefire agreement mandates the daily entry of at least 600 aid trucks, including 50 carrying fuel, with half destined for northern Gaza.

Trump’s sanctions could ‘destroy’ the ICC, insiders fear	Officials at the International Criminal Court say the body is planning for 'worst case scenario' ahead of sanctions by both the U.S. Congress and the White House, fearing the moves could constitute an existential threat to the court. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, coupled with punitive measures sought by Congress, could pose an 'existential threat' to the International Criminal Court, according to a report by The Guardian which cited multiple court officials. The ICC, a tribunal established by the Rome Statue in The Hague, has for months faced blowback over its November, 2023 decision to issue international arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud) over their role in the war against the Hamas terror organization following the October 7th, 2023 invasion. Last summer, even prior to the final issuing of the warrants, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation sanctioning senior ICC officials, barring their entry to the United States and preventing them from conducting transactions with American financial institutions. While the Democratic-majority Senate blocked the bill from moving forward last year, the upper chamber's new Republican Majority Leader has vowed to ensure the resubmitted bill's passage. According to ICC officials cited in the Guardian report, however, the court is even more concerned with steps President Donald Trump could take independently of Congress. The sources said that the sanctions sought by Congress, targeting senior ICC officials, would pose challenges for the court, but would ultimately be manageable. But officials in the ICC are also planning for what some called the 'worst case scenario,' in which Trump issues executive orders targeting the ICC as an institution, rather than singling out senior ICC members. 'The concern is the sanctions will be used to shut the court down, to destroy it rather than just tie its hands,' one ICC official told The Guardian. Barring American banks, insurers, or telecommunications and tech companies from working with the ICC could potentially cripple the court, ICC officials fretted. Tech giant Microsoft's partnership with the ICC is one example of the court's potential vulnerability to broad American sanctions. Should Trump sign a sweeping order targeting all cooperation by American companies with the ICC, the court could lose access to Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, used for virtually of the court's data storage needs. 'We essentially store all of our evidence in the cloud,' one official said. Trump already reimposed more narrowly focused sanctions on some ICC officials, by striking down an executive order issued by Joe Biden rescinding a 2020 Trump order penned in response to an ICC bid to probe Americans involved in the Afghanistan war. But the Trump administration is reportedly seeking broader and tougher sanctions on the ICC over its November arrest warrants, as a means of punishing the court for stepping out of its jurisdiction over member states bound by the Rome Statute. Both the U.S. and Israel are non-member states, and have warned the ICC not to impose itself on countries which are not signatories to the Rome Statute.

Survivor of Hamas massacre to represent Israel at Eurovision	Yuval Rephael played dead for eight hours in a portable bomb shelter as Hamas terrorists repeatedly entered and sprayed gunfire into the room. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A survivor of the Hamas massacre at the Nova dance rave was chosen to be Israel's representative at this year’s Eurovision song contest after winning the 'Rising Star' competition Wednesday evening. In the final round, Yuval Rephael, a neophyte singer, beat Valerie Hamaty, an Arab Christian who has performed before at Memorial Day ceremonies, and for wounded IDF soldiers over the course of the war. Rephael received a 98% approval from the audience at her first audition, the highest of the season, and her performance wowed one judge to the point that he said on the spot that she was 'unequivocally' his pick to represent Israel at the annual European competition. In a pre-taped interview aired as she stood onstage, Rephael told the story of how she had escaped death at the festival held in a forest near Kibbutz Re’im on the Gazan border on October 7th. 'I was in a migunit (portable bomb shelter),' she said, 'on Route 232 between Be’eri and Re’im,' which was later nicknamed the 'road of death' because Hamas terrorists ambushed and slaughtered dozens upon dozens of those trying to flee the carnage, as well as rescuers racing down the narrow highway trying to get to them. Terrorists entered the small concrete room 'some 20 times over eight hours,' spraying the interior with machine gun fire and tossing grenades, she recalled. 'We were around 50 people inside,' she said. 'Eleven of us came out.' They hid underneath the bodies of those who had been murdered, and while hiding she called her father, begging him to call the police. He told her, 'Yuvali, take a deep breath, hide, play dead.' She said she hung onto this scrap of a 'tool' to survive, and it worked. Rephael stated that she had absolutely 'refused' to become a post-trauma victim in the year since, and started talking everywhere about her experience, including the UN, which she said also helped her heal. She wanted to appear in the talent show because it would be a combination 'of the two things holding me together right now, music and public diplomacy. I am dying to represent' the country, she said. The 24-year-old’s English is nearly perfect, as her family spent three years in Switzerland during her childhood. It would 'close a circle' for her, she said, to perform in Basel at Eurovision 2025 this May. While Israelis certainly thought she was an excellent choice to symbolize courage and human triumph over the barbarity and evil of terrorism, haters of the Jewish state lost no time making poisonous comments on social media to link Rephael to Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza. Israel’s representative last year, Eden Golan, was inundated with hatred both before and during the contest, with thousands demonstrating against Israel in Malmo, Sweden while she sang a song whose explicit references to the slaughter at the Nova festival had to be removed because they were 'political,' according to the Eurovision powers-that-be. Golan and her singing team had to be protected by Israel’s security service, the Shabak, and their movements in the city were extremely limited due to fears for t heir physical safety.

Jerusalem man arrested for colluding with Hezbollah	Arab resident of the Israeli capital arrested recently over ties to the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah, and terrorists in the Samarian city of Jenin. By World Israel News Staff An Arab resident of Jerusalem was arrested less than a month ago, over his ties with Hezbollah and other Islamist terror groups. On Thursday, Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency and the Israel Police released a joint statement revealing that the suspect, a resident of the Issawiya neighborhood in eastern Jerusalem, was arrested during a joint raid on his home on December 25, 2024. Following his arrest, the suspect was transferred for investigation by the Shin Bet and the police department's Jerusalem Central Unit. The joint investigation found that the suspect had established contact with Hezbollah operatives and had joined an online group several years ago called the 'Axis of Resistance,' affiliated with Hezbollah. As part of this activity, the suspect communicated with a female Hezbollah operative abroad and shared information with her. This operative had previously recruited other east Jerusalem residents who were recently indicted for contact with a foreign hostile agent. Additionally, the suspect himself had ties with other east Jerusalem residents linked to the Hezbollah operative and shared sensitive security information with one of them, including photographs of sensitive locations. Furthermore, the suspect established ties and met with Islamist terrorists in Jenin, where he was photographed holding weapons. The suspect’s detention was extended multiple times by a Jerusalem court. At the conclusion of the investigation by the Jerusalem Central Unit and the Shin Bet, a prosecutor's statement was filed against him, and his detention was further extended until January 23. An indictment is pending by the Jerusalem District Attorney's Office. 'The Israel Police and the Shin Bet will continue to work with all security forces to arrest terror operatives and thwart terrorist activities, with the goal of protecting the citizens of the State of Israel,' the Israel Police and Shin Bet said in a joint statement.

Israeli troops kill two terrorists responsible for deadly shootin...	IDF forces operating in Jenin eliminate two of the three Palestinian terrorists responsible for the shooting attack in Samaria earlier this month that left three Israelis dead and six wounded. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Two terrorists responsible for a deadly terrorist shooting attack that left three Israelis dead earlier this month were killed by IDF forces during an ongoing counterterror operation in the northern Samaria city of Jenin, an army spokesperson announced Thursday morning. As part of the brigade-level operation in the Jenin area overnight, IDF soldiers from the Duvdevan special forces unit and agents from the Shin Bet internal security agency eliminated two terrorists responsible for the deadly shooting attack in the village of Funduq, which straddles Route 55 in Samaria, on January 6th. During the night, in a counter-terrorism operation by security forces in the Jenin area, under the guidance of Shin Bet intelligence, IDF forces initiated what the army described as a 'pressure cooker procedure' to flush out terrorists holed up in a structure in the Samaria village of Burqin. During an exchange of fire with two terrorists who had barricaded themselves inside, IDF soldiers eliminated the terrorists. The two neutralized terrorists have been identified as Mohammad Nazzal and Katiba Shalabi, residents of Qabatiya and members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist group. A third terrorist not involved in the gunbattle overnight, who remains at large, was also responsible for the January 6th attack, which left two men and one man dead, with six others wounded. Additionally, during the overnight operation, several other terrorists who aided the perpetrators of the deadly attack were arrested and transferred to the Shin Bet for interrogation. During the gunbattle overnight, an IDF soldier sustained moderate injuries and was evacuated to a hospital for medical treatment. His family has been notified.

IDF troops to remain in Lebanon past withdrawal date: Report	After Hezbollah and Lebanese Army fail to adhere to southern Lebanon security commitment, Israel planning to keep troops in the region for the foreseeable future. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli army is planning to keep troops deployed in southern Lebanon for the foreseeable pressure, despite international pressure for Jerusalem to adhere to an agreement which required soldiers to be withdrawn by January 27. As part of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollahsouth of the Litani River which was signed in November, Hezbollah was obliged to withdraw its operatives from the region south of the Litani River. 6,000 Lebanese Army troops were required to be deployed in the area and ensure that Hezbollah does not maintain a presence in the area. Because Hezbollah has not withdrawn its forces and the Lebanese Army has not made significant progress in controlling the area, Israel has decided that its soldiers with remain in southern Lebanon for the time being, according to a Channel 14 report. A senior political source told the outlet that the IDF does not expect renewed fire from Hezbollah, despite troops remaining on Lebanese territory. However, the IDF is preparing for a number of 'potential scenarios,' which include increased Hezbollah aggression. Additionally, the January 27 deadline was pushed by the Biden Administration, the source said. They added that Israel expects newly-inaugurated President Donald Trump to give Jerusalem flexibility regarding the timing of the withdrawal. A report from the Jerusalem Post slightly contradicted the Channel 14 report, stressing that Israeli officials are seeking American approval to remain in southern Lebanon. According to the Post, Israeli officials are lobbying the Trump administration to keep troops on the ground for an additional 30 days. During that time, soldiers will engage in additional raids to destroy Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure. Since the start of the ceasefire in late November, Hezbollah has violated the truce dozens of times. Within the first few days of the agreement, Hezbollah fired mortars into the Golan Heights. The terror group has also attempted to access weapons caches and move the location of rocket launchers.

‘We need a happy ending’ – Liri Albag’s boyfriend speaks out	Nir Alboro found out his girlfriend was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists via social media, says he felt the world was 'collapsing.' By World Israel News Staff Liri Albag's boyfriend made a public statement for the first time about her kidnapping, writing that he was 'collapsing' and urging the Israeli government to do everything in its power to bring her home. Nir Alboro, who had not previously spoken to the media about his girlfriend's abduction, wrote an emotional post on Instagram about his relationship with the kidnapped soldier. Alboro, who served in a combat unit, was seriously wounded in a roadside car bombing during his military service. On the day of the attack, he wrote, Albag was at the airport and minutes away from boarding a flight to the United States. When she was called by Alboro's family and informed about the attack, 'she dropped everything and rushed to the hospital, and did not leave my side for a moment.' Due to the extent of his injuries, Alboro was hospitalized for more than a year. During that time, Albag was a constant source of support and positivity. 'She is an angel. She was always there for me when I needed help,' he wrote. Alboro recalled that on the morning of October 7th, he saw that there were air raid sirens in Gaza-adjacent communities, including the Nahal Oz base. Albag had only arrived at the base after finishing a training course two days before the attack. The two exchanged messages until 8:10 a.m., when contact was suddenly cut off from Albag's end. 'I found out Liri was kidnpped through a Telegram video,' Alboro recounted. 'A friend sent me the clip and asked if it was Liri. I couldn't believe it. I felt like the world was collapsing from under me.' Alboro said that he was shocked that 'such a thing could happen, that they could kidnap Liri while she was in her pajamas.' He urged Israelis to 'tell my story,' stressing that he believes it will eventually 'have a happy ending.'

Judea and Samaria ‘flooded’ with Iranian weapons	Ex-Shin Bet official says that Israel must shift focus to fighting terror in Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff Palestinian terrorists in Judea and Samaria are heavily armed with weapons smuggled into territory by Iran, a former intelligence official told Hebrew-language media on Wednesday. Yossi Amrousi, who was a senior agent at the Shin Bet internal intelligence agency, told Radio103 FM that he backs aggressive anti-terror raids in the region. 'We know that northern Samaria is flooded with Iranian weapons, weapons that are much more aggressive,' Amrousi said. He noted that many of the weapons include advanced 'explosives, as we saw in the recent attack in which an IDF soldier was killed.' Amrousi warned that residents of Israeli communities on the so-called 'Seam line,' bordering PA-controlled cities, could potentially be subjected to an October 7th-style attack. 'If Hamas in Judea and Samaria had the same tools as Hamas in Gaza, what happened in Kfar Aza [a kibbutz targeted by Hamas] would happen in Kfar Saba [a Tel Aviv suburb in central Israel],' he said. He encouraged the IDF to adopt tactics used to fight terror in Gaza, including 'displacing the [civilian] population from a certain area, and going rom house to house until we reach the last of the terrorists.' Amrousi said he was concerned that the release of terrorists, who are considered folk heroes among many Palestinians, will likely encourage future attacks. 'Zakaria Zubeidi is supposed to return to Jenin, and he is an inspiring figure' for terror, Amrousi said. Terrorists could launch attack simply to celebrate the release of these prisoners, he stressed. 'The IDF and Shin Bet must be working at full strength. If the [released prisoners ] return to terror activity, they will have to be thwarted, eliminated or arrested,' he said. He said that he supported the recently launched Operation Iron Wall, which targets terrorists and their infrastructure in Judea and Samaira. However, Amrousi noted that 'on the surface,' this operation does not appear 'significantly different' from previous campaigns that failed to permanently root out the threat.

Hamas commander seen alive after IDF reported it eliminated him	Palestinian media showed footage of Hussein Fayyad, commander of the Hamas Beit Hanoun Brigade, speaking at a funeral. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A Hamas commander the IDF announced it had eliminated in May was seen alive on Wednesday. Palestinian media showed footage of Hussein Fayyad, commander of the Hamas Beit Hanoun Brigade, speaking at a funeral. The IDF reported that Fayyad was killed in an operation that included the 98th Division, the Air Force and the elite Yahalom unit. Fayyad was filmed saying, 'When the strong doesn't achieve its goals, it is defeated; but the weak, which prevented the strong from achieving its goals - it is the victor,' he claimed. Although such errors are rare, it is not the first time the IDF has caught its own mistakes reporting that certain terrorists have been killed. The IDF reported that it had eliminated the commander of the Tel a-Sultan Battalion in Rafah, Mahmoud Hamdan, but he was later seen standing next to Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas who was later killed in an Israeli military operation. In December, the IDF raided Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza to destroy terrorist infrastructure and to battle terrorists who were hiding there. Hamas had been using the densely populated neighborhood as an area to launch weapons and attacks against IDF soldiers. During raids, Israel's military discovered a significant arsenal, including improvised explosive devices (IEDs), RPG launchers, firearms, and loaded magazines. The raid was carried out based on intelligence indicating the presence of Hamas in the area. Airstrikes and ground forces killed numerous terrorists, while others were arrested. In a separate operation, a Hamas squad planning attacks on Israeli forces was eliminated. Additionally, Israeli Air Force jets struck a Hamas command and control facility, which had previously been a health clinic. According to the IDF, significant quantities of weapons were stored there. The army stated it took measures to minimize civilian casualties, employing precision-guided weapons and aerial surveillance.

Trump administration directs all federal diversity, equity and in...	Agencies must also cancel any DEI-related training and end any related contracts, and federal workers are being asked to report to Trump’s Office of Personnel Management if they suspect any DEI-related program has been renamed to obfuscate its purpose within 10 days or face 'adverse consequences.' By The Associated Press President Donald Trump’s administration has moved to end affirmative action in federal contracting and directed that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave and eventually be laid off. The moves Tuesday follow an executive order Trump signed on his first day ordering a sweeping dismantling of the federal government’s diversity and inclusion programs that could touch on everything from anti-bias training to funding for minority farmers and homeowners. Trump has called the programs 'discrimination' and insisted on restoring strictly 'merit-based' hiring. The executive order on affirmative action revokes an order issued by President Lyndon Johnson, and curtails DEI programs by federal contractors and grant recipients. It’s using one of the key tools utilized by the Biden administration to promote DEI programs across the private sector — pushing their use by federal contractors — to now eradicate them. The Office of Personnel Management in a Tuesday memo directed agencies to place DEI office staffers on paid leave by 5 p.m. Wednesday, and take down all public DEI-focused webpages by the same deadline. Several federal departments had removed the webpages even before the memorandum. Agencies must also cancel any DEI-related training and end any related contracts, and federal workers are being asked to report to Trump’s Office of Personnel Management if they suspect any DEI-related program has been renamed to obfuscate its purpose within 10 days or face 'adverse consequences.' By Thursday, federal agencies are directed to compile a list of federal DEI offices and workers as of Election Day. By next Friday, they are expected to develop a plan to execute a 'reduction-in-force action' against those federal workers. The memo was first reported by CBS News. The move comes after Monday’s executive order accused former President Joe Biden of forcing 'discrimination' programs into 'virtually all aspects of the federal government' through 'diversity, equity and inclusion' programs, known as DEI. That step is the first salvo in an aggressive campaign to upend DEI efforts nationwide, including leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to investigate private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against groups such as white men. The executive order picks up where Trump’s first administration left off: One of Trump’s final acts during his first term was an executive order banning federal agency contractors and recipients of federal funding from conducting anti-bias training that addressed concepts like systemic racism. Biden promptly rescinded that order on his first day in office and issued a pair of executive orders — now rescinded — outlining a plan to promote DEI throughout the federal government. While many changes may take months or even years to implement, Trump’s new anti-DEI agenda is more aggressive than his first and comes amid far more amenable terrain in the corporate world. Prominent companies from Walmart to Facebook have already scaled back or ended some of their diversity practices in response to Trump’s election and conservative-backed lawsuits against them. Here’s a look at some of the policies and programs that Trump will aim to dismantle: Diversity offices, training and accountability Trump’s order will immediately gut Biden’s wide-ranging effort to embed diversity and inclusion practices in the federal workforce, the nation’s largest at about 2.4 million people. Biden had mandated all agencies to develop a diversity plan, issue yearly progress reports, and contribute data for a government-wide dashboard to track demographic trends in hiring and promotions. The administration also set up a Chief Diversity Officers Council to oversee the implementation of the DEI plan. The government released its first DEI progress report in 2022 that included demographic data for the federal workforce, which is about 60% white and 55% male overall, and more than 75% white and more than 60% male at the senior executive level. Trump’s executive order will toss out equity plans developed by federal agencies and terminate any roles or offices dedicated to promoting diversity. It will include eliminating initiatives such as DEI-related training or diversity goals in performance reviews. Federal grant and benefits programs Trump’s order paves the way for an aggressive but bureaucratically complicated overhaul of billions of dollars in federal spending. The order does not specify which programs it will target but mandates a government-wide review to ensure that contracts and grants are compliant with the Trump administration’s anti-DEI stance. It also proposes that the federal government settle ongoing lawsuits against federal programs that benefit historically underserved communities, including some that date back decades. Trump’s executive order is a 'seismic shift and a complete change in the focus and direction of the federal government,' said Dan Lennington, deputy council for the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, which has pursued several lawsuits against federal programs. The institute recently released an influential report listing dozens of programs the Trump administration should consider dismantling, such as credits for minority farmers or emergency relief assistance for majority-Black neighborhoods. He acknowledged that unwinding some entrenched programs may be difficult. For example, the Treasury Department implements housing and other assistance programs through block grants to states that have their own methods for implementing diversity criteria. Pay equity and hiring practices It’s not clear whether the Trump administration will target every initiative that stemmed from Biden’s DEI executive order. For example, the Biden administration banned federal agencies from asking about an applicant’s salary history when setting compensation, a practice many civil rights activists say perpetuates pay disparities for women and people of color. It took three years for the Biden administration to issue the final regulations, and Trump would have to embark on a similar rule-making process, including a notice and comment period, to rescind it, said Chiraag Bains, former deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Biden and now a nonresident senior fellow with Brookings Metro. Noreen Farrell, executive director of gender rights group Equal Rights Advocates, said that she was hopeful that the Trump administration 'will not go out of its way to undo the rule,' which she said has proved popular in some state and cities that have enacted similar policies. And Biden’s DEI plan encompassed some initiatives with bipartisan support, said Bains. For example, he tasked the Chief Diversity Officers Executive Council with expanding federal employment opportunities for those with criminal records. That initiative stems from the Fair Chance Act, which Trump signed into law in 2019 and bans federal agencies and contractors from asking about an applicant’s criminal history before a conditional job offer is made. Bains said that’s what Biden’s DEI policies were about: ensuring that the federal government was structured to include historically marginalized communities, not institute 'reverse discrimination against white men.' Despite the sweeping language of Trump’s order, Farrell said, 'the reality of implementing such massive structural changes is far more complex.' 'Federal agencies have deeply embedded policies and procedures that can’t simply be switched off overnight,' she added.

It’s especially meaningful that this year’s awards are going to a number of Israeli authors and books on Israel,' Elisa Spungen Bildner, the Jewish Book Council’s president, said in a statement. By Andrew Silow-Carroll, JTA Israeli journalist Lee Yaron’s account of the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel and their aftermath was named the book of the year at the 74th National Jewish Book Awards, making her the youngest author ever to win the honor. The Jewish Book Council, which sponsors the awards, said that '10/7: 100 Human Stories,' provides 'a vital window into the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how internal political turmoil in Israel has affected it, offering the narratives not of politicians or the military but of the lives of everyday people who lived tenuously on the border with Gaza.' Yaron, 30, speaking to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency last September, said that her impulse to interview survivors, first responders and eyewitnesses to the attacks grew out of her own grief and sense of shock over the Hamas attacks, which killed some 1,200 people and took hundreds hostage. 'I had a mission, I knew what I needed to do, and I was focused on this,' said Yaron, who divides her time between New York and Israel. 'The book helped me to deal with my grief and my sense of hopelessness.' Yaron is among a number of Israeli authors, as well as books about Israel, due to be honored by the JBC at the Marlene Meyerson JCC Manhattan Wednesday evening as part of the JCC’s Books That Changed My Life Festival. Amir Tibon won the award for autobiography and memoir for 'The Gates of Gaza: A Story of Betrayal, Survival, and Hope in Israel’s Borderlands,' which centers on his rescue by his father and mother as Hamas terrorists invaded his neighborhood at Kibbutz Nahal Oz. Ayelet Tsabari won the JJ Greenberg Memorial Award for Fiction, her first, for her novel 'Songs for the Brokenhearted,' a family drama that draws on her Yemeni Jewish background. The Hebrew Fiction in Translation award went to Maya Arad for her book 'The Hebrew Teacher,' translated by Jessica Cohen. The collection of novellas largely focuses on Israelis living in the United States. In the visual arts category, several authors shared the award for '101 Treasures from the National Library of Israel'; the Jerusalem-based library last year celebrated its move to a new state-of-the-art building. 'It’s especially meaningful that this year’s awards are going to a number of Israeli authors and books on Israel,' Elisa Spungen Bildner, the Jewish Book Council’s president, said in a statement. 'These works offer critical opportunities for engagement, debate, and dialogue for our community–one of the most fundamental roles of literature. We are proud to uplift and support these books and bring them to new readers across the world.' The JBC also honored Rabbi Irving (Yitz) Greenberg, 91, with its Lifetime Achievement Award for his latest book, 'The Triumph of Life: A Narrative Theology of Judaism.' Greenberg is a leading Modern Orthodox theologian, and the JBC said his book represents a 'culmination of his many decades of thinking and teaching about Jewish philosophy and theology,' according to the statement. Yael van der Wooden won the Goldberg Prize for Debut Fiction for her novel 'The Safekeep.' The highly anticipated novel, by a writer who is originally from Tel Aviv and currently resides in the Netherlands, is a love story set in a 1960s Holland haunted by the legacy of World War II. The JBC presented its Mentorship Award to Aaron Lansky, the founder of the Yiddish Book Center, a repository, museum and Yiddish learning center in Amherst, Massachusetts. Lansky, 69, who according to the judges 'fundamentally reshaped the fate of one of the great Jewish languages’ histories,' is set to retire in June. The mentorship award is named in honor of Carolyn Starman Hessel, the former executive director of the Jewish Book Council.

Judean town names planned neighborhood in honor of Trump	The T-1 area spans approximately 12,000 dunams (4,000 acres) and connects Ma’ale Adumim with Jerusalem. By JNS The mayor of Ma’ale Adumim, an Israeli town in Judea, announced on Tuesday the renaming of municipal lands as Trump One, or T-1, in honor of U.S. President Donald Trump. 'Trump’s second term is a unique opportunity to strengthen Jewish communities, especially in Judea and Samaria,' Ma’ale Adumim Mayor Guy Yifrach wrote in a statement announcing the renaming. (The area previously known as E-1, or Mevaseret Adumim). 'We trust Trump and believe that he will promote construction in the region in the coming months,' added Yifrach. The T-1 area spans approximately 12,000 dunams (4,000 acres) and connects Ma’ale Adumim with Jerusalem. Like all Israeli communities in Judea and Samaria, Ma’aleh Adumim is considered illegal by most European Union countries, which have protested plans to expand Ma’ale Adumin specifically. The Biden administration called the project 'inconsistent with international law' last year. Proponents of the expansion say it will bolster national security and address the housing shortage in the Greater Jerusalem area, as well as increase Jewish presence in Judea and Samaria. Successive Israeli governments have, however, delayed the area’s development because of its diplomatic sensitivity. Yifrach called T-1 is 'a strategic asset' for Israel, adding that the fact it’s uninhabited 'is a historical folly. The time has come to implement the vision of Israel’s leaders, who saw the development of the area as a strategic goal, and to strengthen the territorial contiguity between Ma’ale Adumim and Jerusalem.'

Houthis release 25-man crew of hijacked ship linked to Israel	Since Hamas’s October 7 attack, the Houthis have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Yemen’s Houthi rebels released the 25-man crew of the Israel-linked MV Galaxy Leader on Wednesday one year after hijacking the vessel, the Houthi-owned Masirah TV reported. The vessel is owned by Galaxy Maritime, which is indirectly owned by Israeli businessman Abraham Ungar. The Galaxy Leader was chartered to a Japanese company and flying a Bahamian flag when the Houthis hijacked it near the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah on Nov. 19. The crew, who are nationals of the Philippines, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Mexico, were handed over to Oman, according to Galaxy Maritime. The Houthis said on Sunday that they would limit their attacks on Red Sea shipping to commercial vessels owned by Israel or flying its flag according to the Yemen-based Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center. The announcement came one day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect. The Houthis vowed in early December to target any Israel-bound ship in the Red Sea, regardless of its ownership. From bases along the Yemeni coast, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels have attacked or harassed around 100 ships in the Red Sea as they traverse the Bab el-Mandeb Straits, a narrow maritime choke point between the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. The majority of the world’s oil passes through the strait from the Indian Ocean towards the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea. Their attacks have brought the Port of Eilat to a standstill. Port management placed around one-quarter of the 120 workers on unpaid leave, cut back the work hours of 20 others in July. The attacks also had a devastating impact on Egypt as Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty recently confirmed that revenue from the Suez Canal has dropped 60%. Since Hamas’s October 7 attack, the Houthis have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel. The majority have been intercepted before reaching Israeli airspace. Israel launched several retaliatory airstrikes on Houthi positions, most recently on Jan. 10.

The London-based Asharq Al-Awsat daily reported that Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Mossad director David Barnea reached an agreement with Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office denied media reports on Wednesday that an agreement was reached to allow the Palestinian Authority to take control of Gaza’s Rafah border crossing with Egypt. 'The report is incorrect despite efforts by the Palestinian Authority to create a false picture to the effect that it controls the crossing,' Netanyahu’s office said. 'According to the agreement, [Israel] forces are positioned around the crossing and there is no passage without [Israeli] supervision, oversight and advance approval.' The crossing is currently manned by the Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet). 'The technical management inside the crossing is being carried out by Gazans not affiliated with Hamas, with security by the Shin Bet, who have been managing civilian services in the Strip, such as electricity, water and sewage, since the start of the war. Their work is supervised by the international EUBAM force,' the statement said, referring to the European Union Border Assistance Mission. 'The only practical involvement of the Palestinian Authority is its stamp on the passports, which according to the existing international arrangement, is the only way Gazans may leave the Strip in order to enter, or be received in, other countries,' the statement added. The London-based Asharq Al-Awsat daily reported that Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Mossad director David Barnea reached an agreement with Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad. The paper also reported that Israel proposed a partial withdrawal of its forces from the Philadelphi corridor. This corridor is a buffer zone that runs the length of the 14-km Gaza-Egypt border. It was created in 2006 to prevent weapons smuggling after Israel disengaged from the Strip but Hamas violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority the following year. Egypt demands a full Israeli withdrawal from the buffer zone. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 94 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead.

IDF investigating possible terror drone found near Jewish town in...	The Fighting for Life NGO, which organizes protests against terrorism in Samaria, said that the only explanation for the incident was that terrorists were training for another Oct. 7-style attack. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces on Wednesday responded to reports of a possible armed drone discovered outside the Jewish town of Yitzhar in Samaria, a military spokesperson told JNS. Troops were called to the scene after residents found 'a suspicious object in the form of a drone,' the IDF spokesperson confirmed. The soldiers moved to close the area until bomb disposal experts could be brought in to neutralize the object, according to the military. According to the Israel Hayom daily, the incident marked the second time a suspicious drone has been found in the vicinity of Yitzhar. The previous UAV was found to be carrying a mock bomb, residents said. Locals told the newspaper that the drone discovered on Wednesday appeared to have been launched from the Palestinian village of Madama, less than a mile north of Yitzhar. A drone carrying an IED fell next to Yitzhar in Samaria. Bomb squad is on the way to see if it's real or a fake test bomb. This is a very serious threat to all Jewish towns in J&S. &mdash; Daniel | דניאל (@DanitheSett) January 22, 2025 The Fighting for Life NGO, which organizes protests against terrorism in Samaria, said that the only explanation for the incident was that terrorists were training for another Oct. 7-style attack. 'It starts with failed attempts, but even the first rockets were flying tubes that we laughed at, and the enemy learned,' the NGO said. 'What started as rock-throwing terror from the village on the nearby road quickly turned into explosive drones—and who knows what else the enemy is planning.' The organization called on the military to enter the villages surrounding Yitzhar, 'evacuate the terrorist population and to ensure that no infrastructure that terrorists could one day use is left standing.' On Tuesday, the IDF launched 'Operation Iron Wall' against Iranian-backed Palestinian terror organizations in Jenin in northern Samaria. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed that Jerusalem would 'not allow the arms of the Iranian octopus and radical Sunni Islam to endanger the lives of the [Israeli] residents and establish an eastern terrorist front.' While the operation is initially only focused on the terrorist hub of Jenin, an unnamed senior security force told the Channel 14 News broadcaster on Tuesday evening that the large-scale campaign could last months. 'When it ends, the terror camps will cease to exist. What we did in Gaza, we will do to them as well; we will leave them in ruins,' the source said.

UN chief warns against Israeli annexation of Judea, Samaria	United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warns that Israel may take advantage of Trump's presidency to annex Judea and Samaria, hold Gaza Strip 'in limbo' under de facto Israeli administration. By World Israel News Staff The United Nations Secretary-General warned Wednesday that Israel may try to apply sovereignty over Judea and Samaria during President Donald Trump's second term in office, and could effectively maintain control over the Gaza Strip without formally annexing the territory. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed mixed feelings regarding the truce in the Gaza Strip between Israel and the Hamas terror organization, saying he is currently 'optimistic about the situation,' while adding it is unclear if the ceasefire will hold through all three of its planned phases. Guterres warned that Israel may keep Gaza in 'limbo,' preventing the coastal enclave from either self-rule, control by the Palestinian Authority, or administration by an international force. Furthermore, the Secretary-General said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could return to his shelved 2019 sovereignty plan for Judea and Samaria. 'There's a risk that Israel will feel this is the moment to annex the West Bank and keep the Gaza Strip in a state of limbo,' Guterres said. On the eve of Israel's second Knesset election in 2019, Netanyahu vowed that if elected again as premier, he would annex large swaths of Judea and Samaria, beginning with the Jordan Valley. The plan was to have been integrated into the Trump administration's Deal of the Century, which would have enabled Israel to apply sovereignty over all Jewish towns in Judea and Samaria, in exchange for a commitment to accept the establishment of a Palestinian state if the Palestinian Authority adopted the Trump proposal. In his address at Davos, Guterres also urged Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions, and to 'engage constructively' with Israel, the U.S., and moderate Arab states. 'The most relevant question is Iran and relations between Iran, Israel and the United States.' 'Here my hope is that the Iranians understand that it is important to once and for all make it clear that they will renounce to have nuclear weapons, at the same time that they engage constructively with the other countries of the region.'

Israel not committing to Palestinian state in exchange for Saudi ...	Netanyahu confident tells the Knesset Israel has not committed to backing Palestinian statehood in exchange for a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia, says Jerusalem will work with US and regional allies to devise day-after plan for Gaza Strip. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Israeli government has not made no commitments to recognize a Palestinian state in exchange for a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia, a senior Israeli minister and confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Knesset on Wednesday. Opposition MK Oded Forer (Yisrael Beytenu) asked Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer - a former ambassador to the United States who has not been elected to the Knesset, but is a member of Netanyahu's inner circle of advisors - whether the government had promised to back the establishment of a Palestinian state as part of a deal expanding President Donald Trump's Abraham Accords to include Saudi Arabia. 'There isn't any such promise regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state, none at all,' Dermer insisted. Dermer also told the Knesset that Jerusalem will work closely with the Trump administration and regional allies to devise a plan for the post-war management of the Gaza Strip, without elaborating on who would be charged with securing or administering the coastal enclave. 'For a while now, I’ve been hearing the need for an Israeli plan, and we’re actively working on it. I’m directly involved in shaping this strategy for the day after in Gaza.' 'Since it’s an Israeli initiative, we must align with both the United States and regional powers. I’m very optimistic that we can achieve effective management in Gaza post-conflict, fully in line with the Prime Minister’s framework. We’ll focus on action rather than words.' Turning to the ongoing ceasefire in Lebanon between Israel and the Hezbollah terror organization, Dermer said Israel retains the right and 'the ability to enforce any violation and will do what is necessary to maintain the security of the residents of the north.' Dermer spoke shortly after the IDF revealed that Israeli forces had uncovered rocket launchers, anti-tank missiles, and other heavy weaponry hidden in caches in the Mount Dov area on the Lebanon-Israel border.

Released hostage Emily Damari’s injured hand becomes an instant s...	Together, the symbol is emerging as a companion to the yellow ribbon, which has become a ubiquitous symbol of advocacy for the hostages. By Philissa Cramer, JTA Within hours of her release from captivity in Gaza, Emily Damari’s hand had become a new Israeli icon. Damari was injured on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists shot her and took her hostage. It became clear after she was released on the first day of a ceasefire on Sunday that she had lost the ring and middle finger on her left hand. The clearest evidence came in a photograph released by the Israeli government, and later confirmed by pictures her family shared, showing Damari video chatting with her brother and father. In it, she was smiling as she showed off her hand, which was bandaged, with her thumb, index and pinky fingers visible. Soon, supporters had added bandages to the 'rock on' emoji, which uses the same configuration of fingers, to transform Damari’s injury into a symbol of defiance. Damari’s mother, Mandy, added the emoji to her handle on the social network X, and posted a photo with her daughter grinning while displaying the wounded hand. I told Emily about all the @SpursOfficial fans who released yellow balloons and created a 'She's one of our own' chant for her. She is so touched and we can't wait to join you again for a match Let's keep going for the 94 remaining hostages, including 8 with British links pic.twitter.com/7YMK6UtA90 &mdash; Mandy Damari (@DamariMandy) January 22, 2025 The most widely circulated version was made by Aviad Amergi, an Israeli sneaker artist, who posted it on Instagram along with the words, 'A great small victory.' His followers quickly requested that he turn it into a sticker for WhatsApp, the messaging platform that is massively popular in Israel, where it soon circulated widely. Others adapted Damari’s gesture as well. A drawing of Damari’s hands demonstrating the Jewish priestly blessing circulated online, with words from the biblical benediction: 'May God bless you and keep you.' The drawing was attributed to Moshe Shapira, a Jerusalem artist and architect, whose son Aner was killed on Oct. 7 after saving the lives of others. The Israeli soccer play Ohad Hazut made the sign with his hands after a win on Monday, writing on Instagram, 'An important victory.' And at least one Israeli has even had the image etched onto his leg as a tattoo, according to a video shared by the pro-Israel influencer Hen Mazzig. Emily Damari is officially an icon of resilience in Israel pic.twitter.com/vGf8nHAVWx &mdash; Hen Mazzig (@HenMazzig) January 20, 2025 Together, the symbol is emerging as a companion to 'We Will Dance Again,' the refrain adopted by survivors of the Nova music festival massacre, as a show of resilience for Israelis traumatized by Oct. 7. It also joins the yellow ribbon, which has become a ubiquitous symbol of advocacy for the hostages. 'There are many symbols of victory, this is my symbol,' tweeted the Israeli artist Nemo Shiff alongside several renditions of Damari’s hand. 'For me, it symbolizes survival and bravery against all odds.' Some — including Lihi Lapid, the writer who is the wife of Yair Lapid, the Israeli parliamentary opposition leader — have also noted that the configuration of Damari’s remaining fingers is the same as the sign for 'I love you' in American Sign Language. Damari herself channeled both interpretations in her first Instagram post after returning to Israel. ''Love, love, love,' she posted, in a video visible to her friends and family but soon shared much more widely. 'I have returned to my beloved life.' She ended her post with the 'rock on' emoji.

More foreign air carriers announcing return to Israel	Air France will begin flying to Israel on Saturday, British Airways on April 5. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Encouraged by the successful start of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire Sunday, more foreign air carriers are returning to Israel, with Air France announcing that its first daily flight will take off from Paris on Saturday. The airline will be followed next week by the low-cost subsidiary that it shares with KLM, Transavia France. The Lufthansa Group, which includes its own airline as well as Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings, announced last week that all its carriers will gradually resume air service beginning February 1. That date will also see the return of the Italian flag carrier, ITA, to its daily Rome-Tel Aviv route. British Airways was more cautious, announcing that it would restart its daily Heathrow-Ben Gurion run only on April 5. According to Globes, other major airlines, such as Air India, Air Baltic and Iberia, are expected to announce their decision to restart operations in Israel in the coming days. The report also said that American Airlines is 'currently considering a return.' American, Delta and United are the three huge American companies that regularly plied routes from Tel Aviv to many cities in the U.S. before pulling out after the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7, 2023 due to safety concerns. Delta was already scheduled to resume its own flights in April, after announcing several times over the last 15 months that it would do so but always stepping back after flare-ups in the fighting. It remains to be seen if it moves up the timetable due to its rival’s decision, and if United follows suit. Since the war began, the only major carrier with direct flights from Israel to the U.S. has been El Al, and ticket prices skyrocketed as it took advantage of its monopoly. In an effort to break El Al’s domination, small Israeli carrier Arkia announced nine days ago that on February 8 it would begin three weekly flights directly to JFK Airport in New York in partnership with Airtech, a new company formed by members of Israel’s high-tech industry, who were especially suffering from the lack of flights. Ben Gurion Airport is currently served by 33 carriers, which is half its normal complement. These include the Chinese Hainan Airlines, FlyDubai of the UAE, small European national carriers, and Ethiopian Airlines to Africa.

Ramaswamy leaves Trump administration after one day	Trump spokesperson Anna Kelly confirmed his exit and suggested the billionaire is preparing to pursue political office in Ohio. By Jewish Breaking News Trump 2.0 has only just started, and it has already had its first political casualty. Back in November, then president-elect Donald Trump tapped Vivek Ramaswamy along with tech tycoon Elon Musk to lead a new agency focused on cutting federal spending and reducing government bureaucracy. The Department of Government Efficiency, dubbed ‘DOGE,’ will operate outside traditional government structures with a mandate to identify and eliminate excessive regulation and spending. The name references a cryptocurrency meme associated with Musk, who has pledged to target $2 trillion in federal budget cuts. But much like his run for president was short-lived, so was Ramaswamy’s time at DOGE. 1 day to be precise. On Monday, Trump spokesperson Anna Kelly confirmed his exit and suggested the billionaire is preparing to pursue political office in Ohio. The timing aligns with the 2026 Ohio gubernatorial race, as current Governor Mike DeWine will be term-limited and unable to seek reelection. 'Vivek Ramaswamy helped create DOGE,' Kelly told Fox News. 'He intends to run for elected office soon, which requires him to remain outside of DOGE, based on the structure that we announced today. We thank him immensely for his contributions over the last 2 months and expect him to play a vital role in making America great again.' Soon after, Ramaswamy took to social media to put out his own statement. 'It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I’m confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government. I’ll have more to say very soon about my future plans in Ohio. Most importantly, we’re all-in to help President Trump make America great again!' he wrote. Trump’s first term was notably marked with a rash of exits. In just four years he went through four chiefs of staff, four national security advisors, five secretaries of defense, six communications directors, and numerous other high-ranking officials who either resigned, were fired, or were replaced. Although no specific reasons were provided in Kelly’s announcement, news of Ramaswamy’s departure follows his controversial statements about American culture on X in late December. He argued that American families should have 'fewer sleepovers' and 'more weekend science competitions.' 'A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,' Ramaswamy wrote. Three sources tell Politico this deeply troubled Trump’s inner circle, especially Musk, who allegedly was the driving force in getting a DOGE desk all to himself. 'They wanted him out before the tweet — but kicked him to the curb when that came out,' said one source with knowledge of the matter. Musk has been making quite the headlines with the influence he is wielding in Trump’s new administration, having allegedly helped orchestrate the release of an Italian journalist from Iran’s notorious Evin Prison, and his broad support of the surging far-right AfD party in Germany.

Trump announces $500 Billion in AI infrastructure investment	Stargate will be 'building the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of AI,' Trump said, adding that the project will create 100,000 American jobs. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a $500 billion private sector investment to build artificial intelligence infrastructure, calling it the 'largest AI infrastructure project in history.' OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle will launch a joint venture called Stargate, committing $100 billion upfront with plans to invest up to $500 billion over the next four years. Stargate is set to begin with a data center project in Texas before expanding nationwide to enhance AI training and deployment, according to the Financial Times. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison confirmed Tuesday at the White House that the project is under construction. Stargate will be 'building the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of AI,' Trump said, adding that the project will create 100,000 American jobs. Trump’s announcement comes amid AI industry leaders’ warnings that the United States must rapidly upgrade its digital infrastructure, including data centers, chips, and key resources. Recent AI developments such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT demand massive computing power to run and have strained existing resources, the Times reported. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has urged officials to support the buildout, warning that China could soon outpace the United States in the AI arms race. 'If the U.S. doesn't attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects—strengthening the Chinese Communist Party's global influence,' OpenAI said in its policy white paper last week, estimating that there are '$175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects.' In early January, Hussain Sajwani, chairman of Dubai-based property developer Damac, announced a $20 billion investment in U.S. data centers at a meeting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son made a separate pledge last month to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. Trump hailed the commitment as 'a monumental demonstration of confidence in America’s future.' Since his inauguration on Monday, Trump has signed dozens of executive orders and memorandums, including a national emergency declaration at the southern border, measures to bolster domestic energy production, and the termination of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs within the federal government. Trump has also withdrawn the United States from the Paris climate accords and the World Health Organization.

Trump nominee rips ‘antisemitic’ UN, defends Israel’s ‘biblical r...	Congresswoman tapped by Trump to serve as American ambassador to the United Nations backs Israel's 'biblical right' to Judea and Samaria, rips UN as 'antisemitic,' and vows to reassess support for funding of UN programs. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Senators questioned President Donald Trump's nominee for Ambassador to the United Nations on Tuesday, grilling the congresswoman over her views regarding the international body, Palestinian statehood, and the future of American funding for various UN agencies, including the controversial Palestinian relief organization UNRWA. Rep. Elise Stefanik appeared in the U.S. Senate Tuesday for a hearing on her nomination, which must be confirmed by a majority of the upper chamber of Congress. Fielding questions from lawmakers at the hearing, Stefanik called the United Nations 'antisemitic,' pledging to both work towards reforming the UN and reconsidering American funding for some of its activities. Stefanik vowed that under her leadership, the American mission to the UN would 'be a voice of moral clarity on the UN Security Council and at the United Nations at large for the world to hear the importance of standing with Israel.' Regarding the $18 billion the U.S. provides the United Nations annually, Stefanik promised a comprehensive reassessment of taxpayer funding for every UN program currently receiving American government funds. 'If confirmed, I am committed to a full review across the UN’s programs. I think it’s very important that we do a full review, as the president announced the executive order today as well regarding all of foreign aid, and I would make sure that we are being good stewards of US taxpayer dollars.' In particular, Stefanik took aim at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), over the agency's ties to Palestinian terrorism, including links to Hamas and the October 7th, 2023 invasion of Israel. 'There were individuals in UNRWA who participated, who executed and committed terrorist acts against Israel on Oct. 7. [Yahyah] Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, carried an UNRWA passport. You had a Hamas data center under UNRWA headquarters, so the rot is deep,' Stefanik said. 'Congress made the right decision. I was proud to be one of the leaders when it came to defunding UNRWA, and I am committed to holding them accountable.' During the hearing, Chris Van Hollen, Maryland's senior Democratic senator, questioned Stefanik whether she supported Palestinian self-determination or Israel's biblical rights to Judea and Samaria as parts of the ancient Jewish homeland. Van Hollen claimed Stefanik had in private expressed support for Palestinian self-determination, as well as Israel's 'biblical right to the entire West Bank,' citing the views of Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. 'I believe the Palestinian people deserve so much better than the failures that they’ve had under terrorist leadership,' Stefanik said, regarding Palestinian self-determination. 'Of course they deserve human rights.' Regarding whether she believes in Israel's 'biblical right' to Judea and Samaria, Stefanik simply replied 'yes.'

From the frontlines to the book: Israeli brigade officer chronicl...	One of the most challenging missions Zilberman’s unit faced was the evacuation of 150,000 civilians in Khan Yunis. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Lt.-Col. Eli Zilberman’s Namer APC rumbled across the Gaza border on October 27, 2023. The smell of smoke and the relentless whistling of mortar fire greeted his unit as it advanced into Gaza City. 'We weren’t just fighting terrorists,' Zilberman recalled. 'We were fighting an entrenched system that had infiltrated every aspect of life in Gaza.' Within hours, the realities of war would set in: comrades injured, civilians displaced, and the brutal sights of urban combat etched into their memories. For Zilberman, a 35-year-old father of two and a successful tech entrepreneur, war was a return to a life he thought he had left behind. But when Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, Zilberman answered the call of duty — and documented his experiences. His just-released book, Lions on Namer APCs, recounts fierce battles in northern Gaza, Khan Yunis, and Rafah, and witnessing Hamas’s deep entrenchment within Gaza’s civilian infrastructure. 'Initially, I just wanted to document what I was experiencing for my wife and myself,' Zilberman told The Press Service of Israel. 'It started as short notes on my phone, written in the early hours after long days of fighting. But as the war continued, I realized these accounts needed to be preserved, not just for me but for everyone touched by this war.' Writing a book was not something Zilberman ever envisioned. He was busy running two Israeli tech startups. But when a friend’s desperate call on the morning of October 7 alerted him to the chaos unfolding in southern Israel, Zilberman donned his uniform and rushed to the battlefield. 'There’s hardly a house in Gaza without some connection to Hamas,' Zilberman told TPS-IL. 'One particularly striking moment came when our unit uncovered a luxurious home stocked with Hamas equipment. Seeing an affluent home turned into a hub for Hamas terror operations left me stunned. It wasn’t poverty driving this, it was ideology. That’s the enemy we’re up against.' He added, 'We didn’t see much opposition to Hamas from the population. Mostly, we saw people’s understandable negative reactions to having to leave their homes, but no significant resentment toward Hamas for causing it.' One of the most challenging missions Zilberman’s unit faced was the evacuation of 150,000 civilians in Khan Yunis. 'It was a logistical and moral tightrope,' he said. 'We had to separate terrorists from civilian families, all while under fire.' Soldiers worked tirelessly, checking IDs, questioning evacuees, and using intelligence gathered during the process to locate hidden arms caches. 'The sheer scale of the operation—combined with the constant threat of ambush—was unlike anything we had trained for,' Zilberman recalled to TPS-IL. Regarding the ceasefire, Zilberman remains steadfast that the fight must continue, that the truce is the beginning of a longer battle. 'Bringing the hostages home is our sacred duty. But we can’t stop there,' he insisted. 'We need to ensure that Hamas can never again carry out the atrocities of October 7. We owe it to our fallen soldiers and their families,' he says. 'It’s not just about winning—it’s about ensuring that our children can grow up in safety.' Said Zilberman, 'This book isn’t just my story. It’s the story of every soldier who fought, every family who made the ultimate sacrifice, and every Israeli who lived through this war.'

PA must pay terror victims, Israel’s top court says	The ruling clears the path for terror victims or their relatives to file civil lawsuits and receive compensation. By JNS Israel’s Supreme Court last week dismissed a petition against a law that compensates victims of Palestinian terrorist attacks using Palestinian Authority funds. Asher Stub, an attorney from the Justice for Terror Victims group that initiated the law submitted by Knesset member Yitzhak Pindrus and others, told JNS on Monday that the Supreme Court’s ruling 'cleared the last hurdle' between victims and compensation. The petition dismissed was filed last year by the Palestinian Authority against legislation passed by the Knesset in March 2024 titled the 'Compensation of Victims of Terrorism Bill (Exemplary Compensation).' It asserted that the Palestinian Authority, which spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on paying salaries to terrorists in Israeli prisons, is encouraging terrorism and is, therefore, liable to pay damages in civil lawsuits. The money is to be deducted from tax revenue that Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority on goods passing through border crossings. The Palestinian Authority claimed the law abused punitive damages mechanisms, adding the law would cause its 'collapse.' It also said Israel lacked legal justification to confiscate its tax revenue. Justice Yitzhak Amit wrote in his ruling that the Palestinian Authority’s petition omits how it 'pays terrorists and members of terrorists’ families money and benefits at significant rates, in close connection to the criminal acts of terrorism they committed.' The Palestinian Authority’s Martyrs’ Fund, also known as the 'pay for slay' policy, is a cornerstone of P.A. law, granting terrorists or their next of kin the right to receive payments as long as they live. The ruling clears the path for terror victims or their relatives to file civil lawsuits and receive compensation, Stub said. His organization, Justice for Terror Victims, is handling lawsuits for about 35 families on a nonprofit basis, he said, adding that the statute of limitations on relevant lawsuits is seven years. According to the Palestinian Authority’s estimates in its petition, it stands to lose approximately NIS 2 billion shekels ($562 million) from immediate tax revenues plus another NIS 5 billion ($1.4 billion) in funds that Israel is already holding that belongs to the Palestinian Authority, it argued. In the ruling, Justices Khaled Kabub and Yael Wilner condemned the Palestinian Authority’s 'reliance on Israeli constitutional law, which primarily protects human rights, to avoid the consequences of its support for terrorism against the state and its citizens.' They called this 'repugnant both morally and legally.' 'We are proud to assist many victims in filing lawsuits under this new law and will persist in fighting terrorism and its financial backers,' Stub said. In a statement after the court’s decision, Stub and Sander Gerber, a global investment manager, called the petition’s dismissal 'a groundbreaking step in our efforts to stop the Palestinian Authority’s’ pay for slay’ policy and secure rightful compensation for terror victims.'

Father of hostage meets ICC prosecutor to push for Netanyahu’s ar...	Yehuda Cohen said he was using this pressure tactic to ensure the implementation of the second phase of the deal, when male soldiers are to be released. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A father of a soldier that Hamas is holding hostage met the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague Tuesday to push for the implementation of the body’s arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Yehuda Cohen, whose son Nimrod was captured by Hamas forces in his tank on the border during the terror organization’s invasion of Israel October 7, 2023, said that his motivation was to pressure Netanyahu to keep all stages of the just-completed deal with Hamas, and not stop after the first phase. 'My motivation in the meeting was the promise of a ceasefire,' he told Kan News. 'And the promise that phase two of the deal will be implemented,' when his son as well as the other younger male hostages are to be freed in exchange for Israel’s complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the release of more than a thousand Palestinian security prisoners. He met with Karim Khan 'In the interest of the State of Israel,' he insisted. 'Because the Israeli government is not working to save Israeli citizens, we need to go to external bodies. From [President Donald] Trump, through foreign governments, international organizations and also a body like the ICC.' In an interview with Ynet, Cohen said that Khan had spoken to him 'respectfully,' but said that he couldn’t talk about the warrants, which charge Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant with committing war crimes in Gaza, a charge vociferously denied by almost the entire political spectrum in Israel. Cohen begged to differ, as he told the Knesset’s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee last week. 'Netanyahu is committing war crimes against Israeli soldiers by prolonging a pointless war for more than a year,' he said. 'If supporting these arrest warrants pushes Netanyahu to abandon his private interests to pursue the deal and comply with it down to the last hostage – I’ll do it.' Cohen had outlined his plan to go to the Hague last month, telling the legislature’s Finance Committee that he was going to meet Khan 'to support his lawsuit against Netanyahu, who is not only committing genocide in Gaza but is also committing genocide in Israel – 2,000 deaths.' His number was apparently a rounding upward of the 1,200 people murdered by Hamas and other terrorists in their October 7, 2023 invasion and the number of IDF soldiers and civilians who have died during the war, whether in the fighting or as a result of missile attacks launched by Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen. He also accused the government of paying the hostage families in an effort to dull their protests over the course of the war. Cohen told the Committee that he and the other families receive NIS 90,000 each quarter and an additional NIS 10,000 a month from the government. He said that he was going to fly to the Hague with this 'hush money' that the State is giving him 'as a bribe, perhaps to keep quiet, perhaps [as a way of saying] ‘Wait about your son, you’re making money from it meanwhile.' He noted that 'as an Israeli patriot' for having served in the army, working in a high-tech company that brings in foreign currency to the country, and paying his taxes, 'I have to go to an international legal body to help us pressure Mr. Netanyahu, the defendant, to make a deal to release all the hostages, including my son who is at the end of the list because he is a soldier and went to serve the country.'

IDF bringing Gaza war tactics to Judea & Samaria, says defense ch...	Israeli military reports more than 10 Palestinian terrorists killed in ongoing counter-terror operation in northern Samaria city of Jenin, including aerial strikes and joint ground operation applying tactics used in Gaza war. By World Israel News Staff Israeli forces conducting a joint counter-terror operation in the northern Samaria city of Jenin have killed more than 10 terrorists since the operation was launched yesterday, an IDF spokesman announced Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, the Israeli military announced the launch of Operation Iron Wall, a joint effort of the IDF, Israel Police, and Shin Bet internal security agency to dismantle terror cells operating out of the Palestinian Authority-administered city of Jenin. For years, rogue terror groups, working together under the umbrella organization dubbed the Jenin Brigades, have dominated the city, with the Palestinian Authority's paramilitary security force operating in Jenin only intermittently. Following attacks by the Jenin Brigades on PA forces late last year, the Palestinian National Security Forces launched its largest operation in Jenin in years in an effort to reassert Palestinian Authority control over the city. Several days ago, however, PNSF officers withdrew from Jenin, prior to the launch of the Israeli operation. By Tuesday afternoon, Palestinian health services had reported that six terrorists were killed, with 35 more people reported wounded in clashes between Jenin terrorists and Israeli forces. On Wednesday morning, the IDF said over 10 terrorists have been eliminated, without providing details on the number of wounded. 'Security forces attacked terror infrastructure, targeted several terrorists, and neutralized explosives in Jenin,' the IDF said. 'Over the past 24 hours, the forces have neutralized more than ten terrorists. Additionally, aerial strikes were carried out against terror infrastructure in the area, and numerous explosives planted by terrorists along routes were destroyed.' Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) said the operation marked a 'shift in the IDF's security approach to Judea and Samaria.' The operation, he continued is aimed at 'eliminating terrorists and terror infrastructure' in Jenin's refugee camp, 'ensuring that terrorism does not resurface in the camp after the operation ends—serves as a key lesson learned from the repeated raid strategy in Gaza.'

Trump mulling trip to Middle East	President Trump takes credit for the staggered release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza as part of the ceasefire deal, says the captives would never have been freed 'if I weren't here.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump is considering a trip to the Middle East, he said Tuesday, as his special envoy to the region confirmed reports he will be visiting Israel and Gaza in the near future. Earlier this week, reports cited Trump transition team officials who claimed that special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who represented the incoming administration in hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar, is mulling a trip to the Gaza Strip, along with regular visits to the region, to ensure the full implementation of the three-phase Gaza ceasefire deal. On Monday, Witkoff confirmed that he is planning a trip to the coastal enclave, though he did not provide details regarding the visit. A day later, President Trump told reporters in the White House that he may visit the Middle East soon, while emphasizing that no trip was planned as of yet. 'We’re thinking about going to the Middle East — not yet,' Trump said in response to a question. Turning to the three recently released Israeli hostages who were returned to Israel on Sunday, the president lamented the injuries they had suffered on October 7th, including Emily Damari's loss of two of her fingers. 'The hostages are coming back. Some of them have been very, you know, very damaged. You look at the young lady with her hand practically blown off.' At the same time, Trump took credit for the hostage deal and the captives' return, saying that were it not for the efforts of his transition team to broker a deal, the captives 'would have all died' in Gaza. 'You know how that happened, right? Did you know that? But when you find out, you're not going to be too happy because it was terrible. But the hostages are starting to come back.' 'If I weren't here, they wouldn't be back ever. They would have all died.' 'It should have never happened. October 7th should have never happened. Nobody should be dead. But through weakness, they allowed it to happen. And then it was a disaster from there.'

Tel Aviv terrorist ‘raised suspicions,’ was detained at airport	The Shin Bet said it had questioned Kaddi, but found 'no information that established grounds to prevent his entry into Israel.' By World Israel News Staff A Moroccan national who wounded four Israelis in a stabbing attack in Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening had been detained and interrogated upon landing at Ben Gurion Airport, but was ultimately allowed to enter Israel. According to Hebrew-language media reports, Abdelaziz Kaddi, who held Moroccan citizenship and was a permanent resident of the Untied States, was flagged by security at the airport and taken aside for questioning. Interior Minister Moshe Arbel said in a media statement that Kaddi had raised suspicions among Border Control officers, who detained and interrogated him. Arbel said that the officers did not want to grant Kaddi permission to enter the country, and had transferred him to the Shin Bet security agency for additional questioning. However, Arbel charged, the Shin Bet overruled the airport staff's decision and granted Kaddi a tourist visa and entry into the country. He urged Shin Bet head Ronen Bar 'investigate this serious incident and draw lessons from it as soon as possible.' In a statement, the Shin Bet said it had questioned Kaddi, but found 'no information that established grounds to prevent his entry into Israel for security reasons.' Kaddi carried out his attack in the Nachalat Binyamin neighborhood in Tel Aviv, stabbing four civilian men before being shot dead by an off-duty female Border Police officer. While Israeli officials are confident that Kaddi acted alone once in Israel, it's unclear if he received help in planning the attack. As of Wednesday morning, two of the victims, aged 24 and 28, were in moderate condition. Two other victims, aged 24 and 59, were listed as being in good condition. On Saturday, a Palestinian terrorist from Tulkarem stabbed an Israeli man in Tel Aviv. The victim is in stable condition. The 19-year-old perpetrator, who was illegally residing in Israel, attempted to stab additional people and was shot dead by an armed civilian.

Israeli President Herzog said his belief in Palestinian state was...	Herzog said the idea of leaving territories to prepare for a Palestinian state is 'not realistic at all. It doesn't make sense to Israelis.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who has supported a two-state solution, said the October 7th massacre was a 'wake up call.' Speaking at the Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland to CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Tuesday, Herzog said, 'The idea of the two-state solution is something which, on record, I supported in the past, many times.' He added, 'But I would say that I had a wake-up call following Oct. 7, in the sense that I want to hear my neighbors say how much they object, regret, condemn and do not accept in any way the terrible tragedy of the terror attack of Oct. 7 and the fact that terror cannot be the tool to get there.' Although Herzog said the Palestinians 'deserve' peace, he added that in the post-October 7th reality, Israelis are less likely to make concessions needed to establish a Palestinian State. 'One has to understand the state of mind of Israelis, to come after such a horror and a national trauma, surrounded from seven different frontiers, and expect Israelis to say, 'Hey guys, we are just — we are withdrawing, we're pulling out from that settlement,' or otherwise,' said Herzog. 'That's not realistic at all. It doesn't make sense to Israelis. They need to see something that makes sense regarding their personal security and safety.' Herzog said that normalization with Saudi Arabia was something Israel 'should strive for.' However, regarding the repeated statements by Saudi leaders that Israel should show a commitment to establishing a Palestinian state before normalization could proceed, Herzog said the details and 'nitty gritty' could be worked out through negotiations. He said, 'Regarding the nitty gritty or the conditions, I would ignore some or all the statements. I think these things need to be discussed in closed rooms. I assume the Oval Office will be involved in it as well,' said Herzog. 'Israel is here in this region forever, and that's why we should aim for it, apart also from the fact that Saudi Arabia itself is a key to regional stability.' Regarding Donald Trump's new administraation, Herzog predicted that dealing with the Iranian threat would be the US President's top foreign policy priority. 'Iran will be a main issue on his agenda in the very near future, and it will have to be deliberated,' Herzog stated. 'Iran cannot have nuclear capabilities, and has to stop with its proxies and axis of evil.' He said that Iran is 'rushing' and 'working day and night' to build nuclear weapons. Herzog expressed hope that the ceasefire and hostage release agreement with Hamas would hold and last through its second and third phases. 'I believe that there is a clear potential of getting to the second stage. There is a desire, and we meant it when we signed the agreement,' he said. Herzog added that he believed there was a 'potential' to reach the third phase.

Mother reports terrorist son to the police, thwarting his attack ...	The police had received information from the suspect's mother that he had sent a message to his sister threatening an attack. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A mother reported her son to the police after he threatened a violent attack. The Jerusalem police arrested the man, who is in his twenties, in the Old City soon after he revealed his attack plans. The police, who apprehended the man in a store near Lion's Gate, had received information from his mother that he had sent a message to his sister threatening an violence. He wrote, 'I am going to carry out an attack,' and added, 'I have repented now, and I am praying in al-Aqsa Mosque.' Israel police uploaded a message to Facebook by the man claiming that his mother treated him badly by throwing him out of her home. He wrote, 'Good morning, how are you? Tell my mother… that I am going to carry out an attack and hurt all of you; I swear to Allah that I will destroy all of you. By Allah, I will do it.' A court extended the man's detention, and an indictment was filed. Dean Elsdunne, international spokesperson of the Israel Police, told the Jerusalem Post, 'The arrest of this individual serves as a critical example of our proactive law enforcement and commitment to protecting the public.' 'The Israel Police acted swiftly in response to the threat posed by the suspect and his disturbing messages, ensuring that potential harm to the public was averted,' he added. 'In this case, the suspect's mother played a critical role by reporting the threat, allowing our officers to take swift action. While the Israel Police are always actively monitoring and responding to potential threats, early intervention from the public, as demonstrated here, is vital in preventing tragic events. 'We urge families and communities to remain vigilant and report any suspicious behavior or threats. Public cooperation is essential in reinforcing our efforts to protect the safety of all.' The police Facebook page further stated, 'The police will continue to utilize all available resources to address any threat to the security of Israel's citizens.'

While his family members were released in November 2023, Sasha Trufanov has remained in captivity, appearing in two propaganda videos released by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. By World Israel News and JBN Russian-Israeli hostage Sasha Trufanov is in unstable condition. In an interview with state-run 24 TV Station, Russian Ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov claims that the 28-year-old was wounded during his abduction on October 7 but has assurance from Hamas that he will be released 'alive and healthy.' 'His state of health is not entirely satisfactory,' Viktorov said during the broadcast. 'We hope that for the remaining few days, his health will not deteriorate.' Trufanov was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz during Hamas’s infamous massacre along with his mother, grandmother, and girlfriend. His father was killed during the assault. While his family members were released as part of a short-lived ceasefire in November 2023, Trufanov has remained in captivity, appearing in two propaganda videos released by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. According to Viktorov, Trufanov’s release is expected within the next 3-4 weeks as part of the broader hostage deal framework. He is among 33 hostages scheduled for release during the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, which prioritizes those in the 'humanitarian' category including women, children, elderly, and wounded individuals. This coming Saturday, four Israeli women hostages are scheduled to be released in exchange for a second round of Arab prisoners, Hamas official Taher al-Nunu tells AFP. Additional groups of three are expected to be released on days 14 and 21, with three more on day 28, another three on day 35, and the remaining 14 hostages in the final week. Seven female hostages remain from the initial group of 33 slated for release during the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. These women are Arbel Yehud (29), Shiri Silberman Bibas (33), Liri Albag (19), Karina Ariev (20), Agam Berger (21), Danielle Gilboa (20), and Naama Levy (20). Under the 42-day ceasefire agreement, Hamas has 24 hours to notify Israel of the names of those being released 24 hours in advance. In this Sunday’s exchange that saw hostages Emily Damari (28), Romi Gonen (24), and Doron Steinbrecher (31) freed, Hamas was late in delivering the names beforehand.

‘A new chapter’: Jerusalem celebrates Trump inauguration	The Friends of Zion Museum event attracted ambassadors, Holocaust survivors, members of Israel’s Republican community, and evangelical supporters all united in support of Donald Trump. By Sveta Listratov, TPS The Friends of Zion Museum was Jerusalem’s hottest spot on Sunday night as hundreds of people flocked to watch the inauguration of President Donald Trump. The queue of people waiting to enter stretched across several small streets. But while the main event in Washington was thousands of miles away, for the attendees, this was also a day of celebration for Israel. 'This is the beginning of a new era. It’s for the State of Israel. This is a new partnership. It’s going to be four amazing years with the President of the United States,' Mike Evans, founder of the Friends of Zion Museum, told The Press Service of Israel. 'We evangelicals believe in Genesis, where God says, ‘I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee.’ When America blesses Israel, God blesses America,' he said. The event attracted ambassadors, Holocaust survivors, members of Israel’s Republican community, and evangelical supporters. The swearing-in ceremony was broadcast live on screens across the Museum’s campus. The crowd cheered in standing ovations throughout Trump’s speech, particularly when he spoke about the release of Israeli hostages that took place a day before his inauguration. 'Hamas now understands that working with Trump’s terms is the only way forward; otherwise, hell will break loose,' Evans told the gathering. Evans also predicted significant developments in the region. 'There’s no doubt Trump will support Israel in taking action against Iran, recognizing it as a mutual enemy of Israel and the West. We will soon witness Saudi Arabia coming closer to Israel, and peace will expand, with Egypt contributing to the long-awaited change in the Middle East.' 'This was the most exciting event I’ve attended all year,' Tomer Shlomi, who traveled from northern Israel, told TPS-IL. Carlos Hernandes Sanchez, a Spanish student at Haifa University came with several other international students 'to see the atmosphere and meet the friends of Israel who are not Jewish,' he explained to TPS-IL. 'It’s a new chapter. I am quite optimistic about it for Israel,' he said.

Israel strips Amnesty of tax benefits over anti-Israel activities	Earlier this month, Amnesty International’s international board suspended its Israel branch for two years. By JNS Israel’s Tax Authority has revoked Amnesty International’s tax benefits, accusing the organization of supporting anti-Israel activities and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Monday’s decision follows an inquiry launched in July 2023 and months of review by a special team established by Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. 'Whoever acts against the State of Israel will not be eligible for benefits from the State of Israel,' said Smotrich. The Finance Ministry’s decision to revoke tax benefits stemmed partly from allegations that Amnesty Israel mirrored calls from its parent organization, including support for arms embargoes and tourism boycotts in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria. Ministry Director-General Shlomi Heizler argued that such actions violated Israel’s Boycott Law, asserting that Amnesty Israel lacks independence due to its reliance on international funding, which constitutes 80% of its budget. Amnesty International’s international board earlier this month suspended its Israel branch for two years, citing failure to align with Amnesty’s research, discrediting its findings, and allegations of 'anti-Palestinian racism.' The Israeli branch, founded in 1964 and one of Amnesty’s oldest chapters, denies the racism claims and disputes the parent organization’s accusations of genocide and apartheid against Israel, labeling the findings flawed and inconsistent with international definitions.

Smotrich: US guaranteed Israel’s right to resume fighting in Gaza	Commenting on the conditions for the agreement with Hamas to last through the second stage, Smotrich said that 'our condition is that there is no Hamas.' By Akiva Van Koningsveld and Amelie Botbol, JNS The U.S. has provided Israel with a written guarantee that Jerusalem can resume its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip if negotiations for the second and third phases of the ceasefire agreement fail, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told JNS on Tuesday. U.S. President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden have provided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with an official missive confirming that 'the State of Israel will be able to return to the war on day 43' if talks fail during the 42-day first phase of the agreement, Smotrich said, speaking at a meeting of his Religious Zionism Party in the Knesset in Jerusalem. This guarantee was also given to Netanyahu during phone calls with Trump and American government officials, the finance minister said, adding, 'These two things together create an American guarantee allowing us to return to war.' Commenting on the conditions for the agreement with Hamas to last through the second stage, Smotrich said that 'our condition is that there is no Hamas.' If the terrorist organization agrees, 'great, we don’t want to fight. But if it doesn’t agree, we can return to the war,' he concluded. While the Religious Zionism Party voted against the hostage deal with Hamas—which calls for the release of thousands of terrorists and an Israeli withdrawal from strategic areas in the Strip—it decided against leaving Netanyahu’s government over the deal to ensure that the war 'does not end a moment before complete victory,' said Smotrich. Smotrich had previously demanded that Netanyahu commit to resuming the war to dismantle Hamas terrorist infrastructure and secure the release through military pressure of all hostages following the deal’s first phase, which will only see 30 out of the 94 captives still held in Gaza freed. This commitment was a condition for the party remaining in the coalition. U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, whom President Donald Trump has credited with getting the deal over the finish line, refused to confirm the existence of formal guarantees in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 News after the inauguration on Monday. 'I don’t want to discuss promises that were made; the agreement speaks for itself,' the U.S. envoy stated, adding: 'I think that everyone is well-motivated to negotiate in a good-faith way and see if we can resolve all of this amicably and in a peaceful way and in a diplomatic way.' On Sunday, three Israeli women taken hostage during the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre and held captive in Gaza for 471 days were freed as part of the first phase of the U.S.- and Qatar-brokered agreement with Hamas. Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday he’s not confident that the ceasefire deal with Hamas will hold through all three phases. 'It’s not our war. It is their war. I am not confident. But I think they’re very weakened on the other side,' he said in response to a question in the Oval Office while signing orders in the first hours of his presidency. Asked about the future governance of the Gaza Strip, the president said he believed 'you certainly can’t have the people that were there,' in an apparent reference to the Iranian-backed Hamas terror organization. Talks on the second phase of the deal are scheduled to commence in early February.

Taking responsibility for Oct 7th failures, IDF chief of staff re...	Lt. Gen Herzi Halevi, chief of Israel's military, announces his resignation, while taking responsibility for the IDF's failures on and before October 7th, 2023. By JNS Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi has informed Defense Minister Israel Katz that he will be resigning as of March, Hebrew media reported on Tuesday. Halevi, who succeeded Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi in January 2023, said his decision to step down stemmed from his 'responsibility for the IDF’s failure' during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border massacre, in which Gaza terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. 'At this juncture, when the IDF has recorded significant achievements and is in the process of implementing a deal to release the hostages, I request to end my position on March 6, 2025,' Halevi wrote to Katz. The chief of staff vowed in the letter to transfer his command of the military 'in a qualitative and thorough manner' to his successor. With his resignation, Halevi will become the third-shortest-serving permanent IDF chief of staff after Dan Halutz, who stepped down from the role after some 20 months following the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war. Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster noted that Halevi requested to Katz that he conclude his position after the first 42-day phase of the current hostage deal with Hamas is expected to end on March 1. Hamas’s Oct. 7 assault—the deadliest single-day attack in the Jewish state’s history and the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust—led to a multi-front war against Iran’s proxies and militant allies in the region. The military’s intelligence lapses prior to the terror attack, as well as its failure to swiftly repel the mass infiltration from Gaza, has prompted a flurry of resignations in the IDF, including by top officials.

Calls for Trump to demand extradition of freed terrorists who mur...	Pro-Israel group notes terrorists slated for release under hostage deal include convicted killers responsible for the murder of 16 American citizens in Israel, calls on President Trump to demand their extradition for the Palestinian Authority. By World Israel News Staff A pro-Israel advocacy group is calling on President Donald Trump to demand the extradition of Palestinian terrorists freed under the hostage deal who were convicted of murdering American citizens. Americans For A Safe Israel (AFSI) noted that the killers of 16 Americans are expected to be released in the Gaza agreement. Among the Palestinian Arab terrorists who are being released by Israel are: Mohammad Abu Warda, who was responsible for the February 25, 1996 bus bombing in Jerusalem, in which 26 passengers were murdered, including American citizens Sara Duker, Matthew Eisenfeld, and Ira Weinstein. Wael Qassem, Wassam Abbasi and Mohammed Odeh, who were responsible for the July 31, 2002 bombing at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in which nine people were killed, including U.S. citizens Marla Bennett, Benjamin Blutstein, Dina Carter, Janis Ruth Coulter, and David Gritz. Nassim Zaatari, who was involved in the August 19, 2003 bus bombing in Jerusalem in which 23 people were murdered, including American citizens Mordechai Reinitz, Yitzhak Reinitz, Goldie Taubenfeld, and 3 month-old Shmuel Taubenfeld. Ahmed Obeid, who was involved in the September 9, 2003 bombing of Cafe Hillel in Jerusalem, killing seven people, including U.S. citizens David Applebaum and his daughter Nava Applebaum. Abu Gaanam, who murdered three Jerusalem bus passengers, including elderly American Jewish peace activist Richard Lakin, on October 13, 2015. Khalil Jabarin, who murdered American citizen Ari Fuld at the Gush Etzion Junction on September 16, 2018. Americans For A Safe Israel's national chairman Moshe Phillips said that despite the terrorists having been prosecuted and serving time in Israel for the murders, they can still be charged and punished in the American legal system. 'U.S. law permits the prosecution, in America, of terrorists who kill Americans abroad. There is no legal obstacle of ‘double jeopardy,’ since they have never been prosecuted in the United States. President Trump should demand that the Palestinian Authority immediately surrender these killers of Americans so they will face justice here.' 'Allowing killers of Americans to walk free undermines America’s war against terror. It also sends a dangerous message to terrorists everywhere that they can freely murder Americans, knowing they will be released if their comrades take hostages in the future. Failure to bring these killers to justice thus incentivizes terrorism against Americans.'

6 dead, dozens wounded as IDF launches counter-terror op in Jenin	After Palestinian Authority forces pull out, Israeli army launches Operation Iron Wall against terrorist gangs in northern Samaria city of Jenin, with at least 6 dead in initial fighting. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli forces launched a major counter-terror operation in the northern Samaria city of Jenin Tuesday, an IDF spokesperson announced Tuesday afternoon. The counter-terror sweep, dubbed Operation Iron Wall, was launched in conjunction with the Shin Bet internal security agency and Israel Police, and is aimed at rogue terror groups which have dominated the city in recent years, after Palestinian Authority forces failed to reclaim control of Jenin, despite heavy fighting in December and early January. The Palestinian Authority's paramilitary force withdrew from Jenin prior to the launch of the IDF operation, which includes air support, the PA's WAFA mouthpiece reported. Video footage from the operation showed the use of armored vehicles in support of infantry units during battles in Jenin which left multiple terrorists dead and dozens wounded. According to the Palestinian Authority's health ministry, 6 were killed and 35 more wounded in clashes with IDF forces. According to a report by The Jerusalem Post which cited an Israeli security source, Tuesday's operation was launched in response to the deadly terrorist shooting in the Palestinian Authority-administered town of Al Funduq in Samaria on January 6th. Three Israelis were murdered in the attack, which was perpetrated by terrorists with ties to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad's forces in Jenin. 'On the directive of the Security Cabinet, the IDF, the ISA and the Israel Police have today begun an extensive and significant military operation to defeat terrorism in Jenin – 'Iron Wall',' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday. 'This is an additional step in achieving the objective that we have set – bolstering security in Judea and Samaria.' 'We are acting methodically and with determination against the Iranian axis wherever it reaches – in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Judea and Samaria – and we are still active.'

‘I thought I’d die in Gaza’ – Released hostages begin to share th...	Held both above and below ground and moved dozens of times, one was forced to have a medical procedure without anesthetics. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The three hostages released Sunday have begun to share details of their captivity and the terror they felt even as they were being released with a crowd of Hamas fighters around them, Channel 12 reported Tuesday. Doron Steinbrecher, Romy Gonen and Emily Damari were often but not always kept together, they said, cooking and helping each other. Gonen, who had been a medic, cared for Damari’s wounded hand and leg as best she could under the circumstances, according to a different Hebrew-language report on the hostages. They were moved dozens of times over the 15 months of the war, with some of them forced to spend the vast majority of their captivity in tunnels, not seeing the light of day. Some also spent time in places above ground, including humanitarian areas set up by the IDF in the Gaza Strip for civilians who were ordered out of their cities before the army would engage Hamas forces there. Some of them received medications they needed, but at least one had to undergo a medical procedure without being given any anesthetic for the pain. Their captors sometimes allowed them to watch the rallies for the hostages in Israel on television, and even heard their families on the radio fighting for them. They also were exposed to what happened during the Hamas-led invasion, they said. 'We understood that our families survived but found out that we had lost a lot of friends,' they said. They were terrified about what would happen to them, with one of them saying, 'I didn’t think I would return, I was sure I would die in Gaza.' They had no idea they were going to be freed until Sunday morning, they said, and 'couldn’t believe it when they told us we would be home very soon.' Their joy was tempered with fear at the end, because of Hamas’ last act of cruelty. 'We were deathly afraid at the transfer point from the hands of the terrorists to the Red Cross,' they noted, 'because of the combination of the armed terrorists and the crowds of Gazans' that surrounded them as they moved from the Hamas car to those of the international body, whose sole role in the conflict has been as a taxi service between Gaza and Israel for released hostages. Video of the transfer that Hamas publicized showed the women getting out of their car completely surrounded and hemmed in by dozens of uniformed and masked men holding automatic weapons. Many of the Arabs dressed in civilian clothing were yelling things like 'Allahu Akbar [God is great]' as they held up cellphones to record the event, a fact that belies the image Hamas tries to project to the world of a poor and starving population. The vagueness of which hostage said what was due to the censorship rules the media outlet has to abide by, the report noted.

Elon Musk’s straight-armed gesture at inauguration event ignites ...	Jerry Nadler, the Jewish Democratic congressman from Manhattan, called the gesture antisemitic and said other officials should condemn it. By Philissa Cramer, JTA When Elon Musk gave his own victory speech following Donald Trump’s inauguration, it was something he did — rather than something he said — which ignited the biggest reaction. The billionaire, who was Trump’s top donor during the 2024 election, told a crowd in Washington, D.C., 'This is what victory feels like.' Then he saluted those in attendance, twice, with a straight-armed salute. 'My heart goes out to you,' Musk then said. 'It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured.' To some of his supporters and fans, the salute appeared to be a gesture of his gratitude that was distorted as clips were shared on social media. To many others, mostly among his critics but also including some on the far right, it bore an uncanny resemblance to the straight-armed, palm-down salute of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party. 'For the record, the distance between Trump declaring that he was saved by God to make America great again & Musk delivering the Hitler salute was less than 4 hours,' tweeted Steve Schmidt, a former Republican operative turned critic of the party with 1.4 million followers on X, the social network Musk owns. 'My first glimpse of the inauguration is Elon Musk grabbing his chest and throwing a seig heil. Not encouraging,' tweeted Mike Rothschild, a writer whose books, including 'Jewish Space Lasers,' examine antisemitic conspiracy theories on the far right. Jerry Nadler, the Jewish Democratic congressman from Manhattan, called the gesture antisemitic and said other officials should condemn it. 'I never imagined we would see the day when what appears to be a Heil Hitler salute would be made behind the Presidential seal,' Nadler tweeted. 'This abhorrent gesture has no place in our society and belongs in the darkest chapters of human history. I urge all of my colleagues to unite in condemning this hateful gesture for what it is: antisemitism.' Full video:pic.twitter.com/OoJHbegUq7 &mdash; Yehuda Teitelbaum (@chalavyishmael) January 20, 2025 Around the same time as Nadler’s tweet, the Anti-Defamation League, the antisemitism watchdog group, issued its own ruling: 'not a Nazi salute.' The ADL has tangled with Musk over hate speech regulation on X; the group’s CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, has also praised Musk’s business acumen. 'This is a delicate moment. It’s a new day and yet so many are on edge. Our politics are inflamed, and social media only adds to the anxiety. It seems that @elonmusk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge,' the group tweeted . 'In this moment, all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath,' the ADL added. 'This is a new beginning. Let’s hope for healing and work toward unity in the months and years ahead.' CNN stopped its broadcast of Musk’s speech for two anchors to discuss what one called an 'odd-looking salute.' The anchors did not explicitly compare Musk’s gesture to a 'Heil Hitler' salute. (Trump’s legal team previously sued CNN over its on-air hosts’ comparisons of his rhetoric to that of the Nazis, seeking $475 million in a suit that a Trump-appointed federal judge later dismissed .) But Kasie Hunt noted that Musk is a supporter of a German far-right party and made the analogy obliquely. 'Yes, that salute was evocative of things that we have seen throughout history,' Hunt said. She also signaled that she believed Musk’s supporters would understand the salute the same way she had, saying, 'I think our viewers are smart and they can take a look at that but it’s not something you typically see at American political rallies.' The Nazi salute was itself borrowed from Italian fascists, who adapted it from the ancient Romans. Musk did not immediately comment on the uproar on his account on X. The Jewish pro-Trump pundit Batya Ungar-Sargon, who sides with Musk on speech issues but disagrees with him on the value of issuing visas to workers from abroad, said she attributed his gesture to his famous awkwardness. 'As a person with a *strong* track record of criticizing Elon Musk, I feel extremely confident asserting that this was not a Nazi salute,' she tweeted. 'Elon Musk is a friend to the Jews. This is a man with Aspergers exuberantly throwing his heart to the crowd. We don’t need to invent outrage.' Later, she posted again about Musk’s gesture with a reference to a scientific theory under which a hypothetical subject can be seen in multiple ways with equal accuracy. 'Man it’s not even 5pm on Inauguration Day and we already have a Schroedingers Nazi salute,' Ungar-Sargon wrote . 'Gonna be a long four years…' The post Elon Musk’s straight-armed gesture at inauguration event ignites comparisons to Nazi salute appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/elon-musks-straight-armed-gesture-at-inauguration-event-ignites-comparisons-to-nazi-salute/	2025-01-21T03:37:53-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/musk-salutr.jpg
Rumors swirl of Sen. John Fetterman switching to Republican Party...	If he maintains his conservative lean, rural PA and suburban Republicans will back him,' commented one analyst. By Jewish Breaking News NJ Assemblyman Jamel Holley ignited speculation with a social media post stating, 'Just left a conversation and my source indicated to me that a key Democratic senator is expected to change party affiliation to Republican by next week. Wow!' Rumors point to Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman as the potential defector. Analysts suggest that Fetterman’s shift toward conservative policies has alienated far-left Democrats in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, leading to primary challenges and a lack of party support. 'If he maintains his conservative lean, rural PA and suburban Republicans will back him,' commented one analyst.

Hamas praises Trump, credits him with securing Gaza ceasefire	Trump is a 'serious president,' says senior Hamas leader, lauding the new president for 'ending the war' in the Gaza Strip and welcoming Trump's Middle East envoy to visit Gaza. By World Israel News Staff A top Hamas official praised President Donald Trump on the eve of his inauguration, crediting the incoming president with achieving the recently implemented Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. Mousa Abu Marzouk, a member of Hamas’ ruling politburo and former politburo chairman who now lives in exile in Qatar, told The New York Times via telephone Sunday that the deal reached between Israel and Hamas in Doha last week was achieved thanks to the intervention of then-President-elect Donald Trump and his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. During the interview, Marzouk lauded Trump as a 'serious president,' adding that the hostage deal, which went into effect Sunday morning, could not have been achieved without Trump’s involvement. Marzouk went on to describe the agreement as 'ending the war' in Gaza. 'If not for President Trump, his insistence on ending the war, and his dispatching of a decisive representative,' referring to Witkoff, 'the deal wouldn’t have happened.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior Israeli leaders have stated publicly Israel may resume the war against Hamas after the first six-week phase of the deal. 'Truthfully, Trump gets the credit for ending the war,' Marzouk said. The American-educated former chief of Hamas’ political echelon expressed optimism regarding the prospects of long-term dialogue with the Trump administration, saying he is hopeful the terror group can reach 'understandings' with the U.S. 'We’re prepared for a dialogue with America and achieving understandings on everything.' Marzouk responded to reports from the Trump transition team that Witkoff is mulling a visit to the Gaza Strip itself. 'He can come and see the people and try to understand their feelings and wishes so that the American position can be based on the interests of all the parties, and not only one party,' said Marzouk.

Senate confirms Rubio in 99 to 0 vote, cementing Trump’s first of...	Rubio and President Donald Trump both vowed to rein in the diplomatic agency by refocusing it on what the newly installed White House described Monday as an 'America-First foreign policy.' By The Washington Free Beacon The Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Marco Rubio as America's new Secretary of State on Monday evening, fast-tracking the now-former Florida senator through a confirmation process in which he gained broad backing from lawmakers in both parties. Senators voted to confirm Rubio, who was first elected to represent the Sunshine State in the upper chamber in 2011, in a 99 to 0 vote. During his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio earned praise from both Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he once served as a senior member. Rubio takes over a State Department that aggressively pursued liberal policies under the Biden administration, including through diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives that cost millions in taxpayer dollars. Rubio and President Donald Trump both vowed to rein in the diplomatic agency by refocusing it on what the newly installed White House described Monday as an 'America-First foreign policy.' Rubio is already scheduled to meet this week with the foreign ministers from top U.S. allies in India, Japan, and Australia. The discussions, officials told the Associated Press, are aimed toward combating China’s aggression in the Indo-Pacific region. Rubio described China as a top foreign policy challenge when he appeared before the Senate last week. He also promised to more forcefully confront China’s mass human rights abuses, including most notably its oppression of the Uyghur population. Rubio will play a critical role in shaping the Trump administration’s Middle East policies following four years of often public bickering between Israel and the Biden administration. Those policies are certain to include robust support for the Jewish state. Rubio will immediately oversee a tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which came after Trump promised to rain 'hell' on Hamas if the hostages were not released. 'There are opportunities available in the Middle East that did not exist 90 days ago,' Rubio said during his Senate confirmation hearing, crediting Israel with fundamentally reshaping the region by wiping out Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iranian proxy groups. In keeping with Trump’s pledge to eradicate wasteful spending and stop the American government’s embrace of left-wing policies, Rubio signaled his desire to abandon international institutions that pursue anti-Israel and anti-American policies. This includes the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is facing tough U.S. sanctions for trying to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'The ICC has done tremendous damage to its global credibility,' Rubio said last week. 'This is a test run. This is a trial run to see, can we go after a head of state from a nation that’s not a member. If we can go after them and get it done with regards to Israel, they will apply that to the United States at some point.' U.S. foreign assistance, Rubio added, 'is not charity. Fealty to progressive politics became the benchmark for success. That view is diminishing very quickly.' Ahead of Rubio confirmation, a large number of State Department diplomats vacated their posts at the Trump administration’s behest, including political appointees and career foreign service officers who served in senior roles under former president Joe Biden. A similar effort is reportedly underway at the White House National Security Council.

‘Hostages’ voted Hebrew word of the year	Runner-up words were gevurah (heroism) and hutar l’pirsum (it was allowed to be published), the academy said. By Pesach Benson, TPS In solidarity with the captives held by Hamas for 473 days, Israeli voters selected the word 'hostages' (hatufim in Hebrew) as 2024’s Word of the Year, the Hebrew Language Academy announced on Monday. 'In these days when we are all following with anticipation and vigilance the release of the kidnapped men and women from Hamas captivity in Gaza, the public voted en masse and chose the word 'hostages' as the word of the year – by a majority of 45%,' the academy said. 'This year, the year of the longest and most difficult war in our history, was also a year in which we sometimes felt at a loss for words. And yet, throughout the year, words stood out that reflected reality: the pain, sorrow, and anger on the one hand, and the pride, exaltation, and gratitude to those who sacrificed their lives on the other. The words chosen for the top spots represent this whole,' the academy explained. 'We all hope that on the eve of Hebrew Day next year, we will be torn between words that indicate joy and peace,' it added. Runner-up words were gevurah('heroism') and hutar l’pirsum ('it was allowed to be published'), the academy said. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 94 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. The academy announces its annual word of the year on the Hebrew birthday of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, a linguist who was the driving force behind reviving Hebrew as a modern spoken language. Born in present-day Belarus in 1858, he moved to Israel in 1881. Living in Jerusalem, he wrote the first dictionary of modern Hebrew and published a Hebrew language newspaper. His initiative was controversial, with many people believing that using Hebrew for everyday conversation profaned the language. Ben-Yehuda died of tuberculosis in 1922.

IDF: Gazans can return to north next week if Hamas honors deal	The IDF also warned against approaching Israeli territory and the buffer zone near the border, calling the latter area 'extremely dangerous.' By JNS Unarmed Palestinians will be allowed to return to the northern Gaza Strip without needing to pass security checkpoints starting next week if Hamas adheres to the ceasefire deal, the Israeli military reiterated on Tuesday. Jerusalem remains 'committed to ensuring all aspects of the agreement are implemented,' tweeted Israel Defense Forces Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, head of the Arab Media Branch in the IDF’s Spokesperson’s Unit, on Tuesday. 'If Hamas adheres to all the details of the agreement, starting next week, the residents of the Gaza Strip will be able to return to the northern part of the Strip, and directives will be issued in this regard,' wrote Adraee. In the meantime, the spokesman warned Gazans against approaching the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the Strip’s south from its north. 'Per the agreement, IDF forces will remain deployed in specific areas of the Gaza Strip. Do not approach IDF forces in the area until further notice. Approaching the forces exposes you to danger,' he said. Adraee also warned against approaching Israeli territory and the buffer zone near the border, calling the latter area 'extremely dangerous.' Video footage aired by Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster on Tuesday showed armed members of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s 'armed wing,' burying terrorists in the Jabaliya area in northern Gaza. הלוויה במחנה הפליטים ג'באליא בצפון הרצועה, הארונות מכוסים בדגלי חמאס ומלווים באנשי הזרוע הצבאית של חמאס pic.twitter.com/BcvbeaTMfk &mdash; Nurit Yohanan (@nurityohanan) January 21, 2025 According to the terms of the deal between the Jewish state and the Palestinian terror group, seven days after the Jan. 19 implementation of the agreement, noncombatants will be allowed to return to the northern Strip by foot, without weapons or security checks, via Al-Rashid Street. Vehicles may also return northward via the Netzarim Corridor on the seventh day, subject to inspection by a private security company designated by the mediators and coordinated with Jerusalem. On day 22 of the deal, unarmed Palestinians will be allowed to return to the northern Strip on foot via Salah a-Din road, also without inspection. On Monday evening, Hamas announced it would next free four more hostages on Saturday, backtracking on previous threats to delay their release by a day. Hamas reversed course following Israeli appeals to the mediators, Ynet reported. An Israeli government source stressed in comments cited by local media that a Sunday release would violate the terms of the deal, which calls for four captives to be returned seven days after Jan. 19. Hebrew media had previously reported that the government in Jerusalem was trying to determine whether the terror organization’s reported threat constituted a legitimate announcement or psychological warfare.

Israeli defense chief orders army to block Palestinian victory ce...	Defense Minister Israel Katz instructs IDF to take steps to prevent public celebrations in Judea and Samaria over the release of Palestinian terrorists as part of the hostage deal with Hamas. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's defense minister has ordered the IDF to actively prevent public celebrations and victory marches by Palestinian Arabs in Judea and Samaria, following the release of jail terrorists as part of the hostage deal with Hamas. Israel released 90 jailed Palestinian terrorists on Sunday, in the first stage of a staggered swap which is set to span six weeks. Hamas is slated to release 30 additional Israeli hostages, both dead and alive, while Israel has committed to release 30 jailed terrorists for every freed Israeli civilian, and 50 for each IDF soldier released from captivity. On Monday, Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) penned a letter to IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, instructing the military to prevent public gatherings in Judea and Samaria celebrating the terrorist releases, to actively target armed terrorists who take part in any victory parades, and to crack down on terror groups operating in the area. 'All necessary measures must be taken to prevent the recurrence of release celebrations and large Palestinian processions in honor of the release of Palestinian terrorists to Judea and Samaria – and to target any armed Palestinian terrorist participating in these processions,' wrote Katz. 'The fight against Palestinian terrorism in Judea and Samaria is now the top priority for the IDF and the State of Israel,' Katz continued, citing recent attacks, including a deadly shooting in Samaria, and efforts by Iranian-backed terror cells to expand operations in Judea and Samaria. 'The Iranian terror network and radical Sunni Islamic [groups] primarily operate within Palestinian refugee camps to advance advanced terror means, funding, and directives for carrying out terror activities against IDF soldiers and Jewish settlers. Action must be taken against them with full force to eliminate the terror infrastructure.' 'Victory celebrations for terrorists must not provide additional encouragement to terrorism. It is our duty to provide full protection to the settlers and communities in Judea and Samaria and along the security barrier.'

Trump ‘not confident’ Gaza ceasefire will last, hints US may help...	Hours after taking office, President Trump says he is 'not confident' that the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip will hold through all three stages, while adding Hamas 'weakened' and most of its leaders dead. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump said Monday he is not very confident the recently implemented ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas will hold through all three planned phases, while suggesting his administration may aid in the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. Hours after his inauguration on Monday, President Trump spoke with reporters in the Oval Office as he signed a series of executive orders, overturning dozens of policies put in place by the Biden administration. When asked by a reporter whether he is confident the ceasefire in Gaza - which went into effect Sunday morning - will hold, Trump responded that he is 'not confident.' 'I am not confident. It's not our war. It is their war. I am not confident. But I think they are very weakened on the other side,' Trump said, referring to the leadership of Hamas and the terror group's patron, Iran. When questioned regarding the future of the Gaza Strip and the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the coastal enclave after the war, Trump said Gaza has been left by 15 months of war 'like a massive demolition site' and will have to be 'rebuilt in a different way.' Trump said he 'might' aid in the reconstruction of Gaza after the war, while suggesting Strip's 'phenomenal location' on the coast give it tremendous potential. 'You know, everything's good,' he said. 'Some beautiful things could be done with it, but it's very interesting, but some fantastic things could be done with Gaza.' The president ruled out Hamas' return to power after the war, saying the terror group 'didn't exactly run [Gaza] well, they ran [it] viciously and badly,' adding that 'You certainly can't have the people that were there. Most of them are dead.'

Iran ‘terrified’ for nuclear program as Trump takes office: Analy...	Iran researcher says that regime is concerned about Trump, now willing to engage inn negotiations over future of its nuclear development program. By World Israel News Staff The Iranian regime is extremely concerned about the future of its nuclear program and crippling economic sanctions following the inauguration of President Donald Trump, an Iranian affairs analyst told Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv. Benny Sabati, an Iran researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, said that 'the Iranian regime is really afraid of Trump taking office.' He noted that 'every day, there is another statement from a senior Iranian official, declaring that the regime wants talks and that they want negotiations, and do not want nuclear weapons, and that the economic situation is difficult.' Sabati said these statements 'really scream 'come talk to us.'' He noted that the willingness to engage in talks was mostly coming from the more 'moderate wing of the Iranian regime,' which may include President Masoud Pezeshkian and his advisors. Sabati explained that Trump's election had exacerbated existing schisms with Iran's leadership. 'The regime is in conflict with itself, because there are two schools of thought within the Iranian regime. Iran is in a kind of mess,' he told Ma'ariv. With its public threats to Israel, Tehran 'has climbed a very high tree, and it is difficult for it to get down.' The conservative flank of the Iranian government includes many influential personalities who are 'unwilling to agree to talks and negotiations,' Sabati said. Those leaders are pushing for Iran to emphasize its strength, along with encouraging the 'Revolutionary Guards continue to bare their teeth.' Sabati said that the Iranian people - unlike their government - are excited about Trump's election, and have high hopes for the American president's potential impact on their country. 'The public is very happy with Trump's inauguration. They believe that his arrival will bring about a very significant change in the Iranian regime, and perhaps even overthrow it,' Sabati said. 'These are [the Iranian people's] heartfelt wishes.'

Trump nixes sanctions on Israeli settlers – days after Biden exte...	As one of his first acts after taking office, Trump rolls back dozens of Biden's executive orders, including sanctions against a list of Israeli residents of Judea and Samaria - days after Biden extended the order for another year. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Just hours after taking office on Monday, President Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders revoking orders put in place by his predecessor, Joe Biden, including several targeting Israel or Israeli citizens. Among the executive orders Trump signed Monday overturning Biden-era policies was a measure terminating restrictions on arms sales to Israel imposed during the war in Gaza. Additionally, Trump signed a sweeping order overturning 66 of Biden's executive orders and 12 of his presidential memorandums, including the February 1st, 2024 Executive Order 14115, which targeted Israelis living in Judea and Samaria whom the Biden White House designated as 'extremist settlers.' Last Tuesday, then-President Biden issued a new order extending the sanctions by one year. Biden issued a statement defending the move, calling the alleged actions of the sanctioned settlers an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' to American national security and foreign policy. 'The situation in the West Bank — in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction — has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region,' Biden claimed. 'These actions undermine the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution and ensuring Israelis and Palestinians can attain equal measures of security, prosperity, and freedom.' The original February 2024 executive order was issued in response to claims by left-wing NGOs in Israel and reports by the United Nations accusing Israeli residents of Judea and Samaria of violence and harassment against Palestinian Arabs in the wake of the October 7th, 2023 invasion.

Scared of Trump? Hamas back to original hostage release dates	Hamas said that the next hostage release will take place on Saturday, January 25, as was originally scheduled. By World Israel News Staff Hamas has reversed a decision to change the dates upon which it releases hostages, after American and Israeli commentators noted that the delay constitutes a violation of the newly-implemented ceasefire with Israel. The terror group said in a media statement on Monday evening that it would deviate from the agreed-upon terms in the truce, which require Hamas to provide Israel with the names of hostages to be released on Fridays and transfer the captives to the Red Cross on Saturdays. For seemingly no other reason besides psychological warfare, Hamas announced that it would delay the process by 24 hours, giving Israel the names on Saturdays and only releasing the kidnapped Israelis on Sundays, forcing the hostages to spend yet another day in captivity. But in a hastily-released statement published hours later on Monday night, Hamas clarified that it would indeed abide the original terms of the agreement. Hamas said that the next hostage release will take place on Saturday, January 25, as was originally scheduled. President Donald Trump has stressed that he expects both Hamas and Israel to respect the terms of the ceasefire, threatening serious consequences for violations of the truce. The terror group may have backed down from its original plan to the delay the release under pressure from the Trump administration. According to Hebrew-language media reports, Israeli officials expect the release of one civilian and three female soldiers, who were kidnapped from the Gaza-adjacent Nahal Oz base. Over the next month, three hostages are expected to release on Saturdays. A final group of 14 hostages is expected to be released on the last day of the first phase of the ceasefire. If the ceasefire holds and all 33 hostages are released in the initial stage, Israel and Hamas will continue negotiations for the second and third phases of the truce. There are currently 94 hostages held in the Gaza Strip. The post Scared of Trump?

IDF preparing for major operations in Judea and Samaria	As thousands of terrorists to be released to Judea and Samaria, IDF readying to crack down on terror. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military is gearing up for 'significant operations' in Judea and Samaria, following a ceasefire with Hamas that will free thousands of Palestinian terrorists from prison and return them to the region. 'Along with the intense defense preparations in the Gaza Strip, we must be prepared for significant operations in Judea and Samaria in the coming days in order to preempt and catch the terrorists before they reach our civilians,' IDF Chief of Staff Herzi HaLevi said in remarks published by the military. Halevi also added that the IDF's senior leadership must 'formulate plans for the continuation of the fighting, both in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.' Nearly 2,000 terrorists are currently slated for release during the ceasefire, including some of the masterminds of the deadliest Palestinian terror attacks in Israeli history. Mohammed Abu Warda, who is currently serving 48 life sentences for his involvement in a series of bus bombings during the Second Intifada, is expected to be released within the next month. Zakaria Zubeidi, the commander of the Al Aqsa Marytrs' Brigade in Jenin who successfully escaped Gilboa Prison in 20212, is also set to be freed. Since October 7th, 2023, Israel has been fighting a war on multiple fronts, enduring attacks originating from Gaza, Judea and Samaria, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Yemen. With a ceasefire appearing to hold in Gaza and Lebanon, Syria focused on its internal struggles, and the Iranian axis weakened, the IDF is likely shifting its focus to Judea and Samaria. Iran has long worked to instigate violence and unrest within Judea and Samaria, with Tehran working to smuggle weapons to terrorists based in Palestinian Authority-controlled territory. Although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has referred to the Gaza ceasefire as a 'temporary pause,' President Donald Trump has stressed that he expects a permanent end to the fighting.

Trump removes Biden-era weapon shipment restrictions on Israel	Trump’s executive order signals a complete reversal of Biden’s approach, removing all conditions on military aid to Israel. By Jewish Breaking News President Donald Trump signed an executive order today removing all restrictions on U.S. weapons shipments to Israel that were previously imposed by the Biden administration. The move was hailed by Israeli leaders as a significant step in safety and security for Israel. Background: Biden and Harris Policies on Arms to Israel During President Joe Biden’s administration, restrictions were placed on certain arms transfers to Israel following international concerns over the use of advanced U.S. weaponry in conflicts with Gaza. Vice President Kamala Harris, reportedly pushed for tighter scrutiny of military aid to Israel. This led to delays and limitations on high-tech arms deliveries, including precision-guided munitions. The Biden administration justified these measures as necessary to balance U.S. support for Israel with concerns over civilian casualties in military operations. However, the policy faced backlash from pro-Israel lawmakers and advocacy groups, who argued it undermined Israel’s ability to defend itself against terrorist threats such as Hamas. Trump’s Decision Trump’s executive order signals a complete reversal of Biden’s approach, removing all conditions on military aid to Israel. In his announcement, Trump emphasized the importance of Israel’s security and its right to defend itself, calling the restrictions 'unnecessary and harmful to our greatest ally in the Middle East.' Implications The decision is expected to accelerate the delivery of advanced weaponry, including precision-guided missiles and defense systems, bolstering Israel’s military capabilities. Critics argue that removing restrictions may exacerbate tensions in the region and lead to increased scrutiny from international watchdogs. This executive order underscores Trump’s broader foreign policy pivot toward solidifying alliances with key partners while taking a harder stance against adversaries in the Middle East. The move may also influence U.S. domestic politics, with Democrats likely to push back on what they see as an overly aggressive policy shift.

Hamas used ‘altered images’ to fake huge turnout at hostage relea...	A few hundred people crammed together to make it look like endless masses.' By World Israel News Former IDF spokesperson Peter Lerner, a seasoned expert in media coverage, recently shed light on Hamas's ongoing manipulation of public perception during the release of three Israeli hostages on Sunday. The hostages, freed after 15 months of captivity as part of a 42-day ceasefire agreement, were handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza amidst highly orchestrated media optics. Lerner took to social media platform X to address the portrayal of events on the ground, calling out the staged scenes meant to project Hamas's strength. 'I was asked several times today about the optics of Hamas’ obvious strength. Here’s the real optics,' he posted, sharing both authentic and altered images to highlight the manipulation. 'A few hundred people crammed together to make it look like endless masses. Today the images from the ground were orchestrated by Hamas; they wanted to project power. Everything they show is manipulation.' This strategy of media control is not new for Hamas. During the 2014 Operation Protective Edge, the group implemented a strict campaign to control narratives coming out of Gaza. Documents from the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center reveal that Hamas’s Ministry of Interior and its media division issued explicit directives to shape coverage. Journalists were prohibited from photographing rocket launch sites or showing Hamas operatives’ faces, and every terrorist casualty had to be reported as an 'innocent civilian.' The risks for journalists who defied these orders were significant. According to Honest Reporting, reporters who documented rocket launchers near civilian areas were expelled from Gaza if they exposed the findings. Others waited until they were safely outside Gaza before sharing their accounts of what they had witnessed. These documented examples of Hamas inflating casualty numbers and tightly controlling media narratives reveal a consistent strategy over the past decade. Lerner has also been vocal about Israel's shortcomings in public relations, particularly after the October 7 attacks. In an interview with Haaretz, he criticized Israeli leadership for failing to provide a coherent communication strategy as global sympathy for Israel began to wane. Having participated in 750 international interviews, Lerner described feeling unsupported by the government in addressing pressing questions about Israel’s objectives and future plans. 'I, as a spokesperson, started fielding questions on the subject already on October 10: ‘What are your goals, what are you trying to achieve, what are your plans for the future?’' Lerner explained. 'Very soon I understood that I didn’t have the answers to these questions. Not because they haven’t decided, but because they’re just never going to decide.' As Hamas continues its calculated efforts to influence global opinion, Lerner’s insights serve as a reminder of the importance of countering propaganda with transparency and factual reporting. These tactics, rooted in manipulation, highlight the ongoing challenges of navigating narratives in one of the world’s most complex conflicts.

By World Israel News At a rally marking his post-inauguration, former President Donald Trump declared a 'golden era' in U.S.-Israel relations, turning a typically political event into a platform for advocacy and human connection. The event, defined by its emotional weight, featured former hostage Noa Argamani and families of Israeli captives who remain in Gaza. Wearing yellow scarves symbolizing hope and solidarity, the group stood as a living testament to the ongoing crisis and the human toll it has taken. Introduced by Middle East negotiator Steve Witkoff, Argamani and the families joined Trump on stage in a moment that underscored the urgency of their plight. Argamani's visibly sorrowful demeanor—stemming from her boyfriend Avinatan Or's continued captivity—added a personal dimension to the broader narrative of international diplomacy. Trump's promise to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship and his commitment to securing the release of hostages resonated deeply with the audience. Witkoff, the event’s sole speaker before Trump, praised the former president's leadership in brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Highlighting the role of decisive leadership in achieving the fragile peace and recent hostage releases, Witkoff credited Trump with breakthroughs that many had deemed impossible. The rally took a poignant turn as families of hostages joined him on stage, marking a powerful moment of unity and purpose. Throughout the evening, Trump, joined by former First Lady Melania Trump and Senator JD Vance, personally greeted each family member, shaking hands and offering words of encouragement. While the rally also touched on broader political themes, the presence of these families became the symbolic heart of the event, signaling a clear alignment with Israel during a fraught moment in international relations. The inclusion of these families highlighted the administration’s stance on combating terrorism and supporting Israel, underscoring a commitment that extends beyond diplomacy to address deeply personal human struggles. For the families, it was not just a political moment but a platform to bring global attention to their cause—a cause that Trump vowed to champion as part of his broader foreign policy objectives. In his speech, Trump left no ambiguity about his allegiance, ensuring that the U.S.-Israel alliance would remain a cornerstone of his administration’s strategy. The rally, charged with raw emotion and strategic messaging, bridged the personal and political, turning a routine event into a call for unity and action in the face of adversity.

Hamas violates hostage deal by delaying next release of hostages	The terror group announced on Monday that the next four hostages would be released to Israel next Sunday rather than on Saturday, as previously agreed. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas has violated the terms of the hostage deal by delaying the next release of captives from Saturday to Sunday. The terror group announced on Monday that the next four hostages would be released to Israel next Sunday rather than on Saturday, as previously agreed. Hamas spokesperson Nahed Fakhoury said, 'The second phase of the initial process will begin on Saturday, January 25, 2025. On this day, the resistance will submit the names of Israeli captives to be released, and in return, Israel will present a list of Palestinian prisoners to be freed. The exchange itself is scheduled to occur on Sunday, January 26, 2025, based on these lists.' Israeli officials expect the release of one civilian and three female soldier observers kidnapped from the Nahal Oz base on October 7. As with previous releases, the hostages are expected to be brought by Hamas to the Red Cross in Gaza before being transported to Israel to be reunited with their families and receive medical care. Prior to the release of three female civilian hostages on Sunday, Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher, and Emily Damari, Hamas delayed releasing the names on Saturday afternoon, as required by the agreement. Although the delay didn't lead to a breakdown in the hostage deal, an Israeli official warned that such infractions by Hamas should not be frequent. In the following weeks, 33 hostages are slated to be released, most of them women, children, men over 50, and ill hostages. The 33 hostages are Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Ohad Ben Ami, the four members of the Bibas family, Yarden, Shiri, Ariel, Kfir, Agam Berger, and Romi Gonen. Other names include: Daniella Gilboa, Emily Damari, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, Omer Wenkert, Alexander Troufanov, Arbel Yehud, Ohad Yahalomi, Eliya Cohen, Or Levy, Naama Levy, Oded Lifshitz, Gadi Moshe Mozes, Avera Mengistu, Shlomo Mansour, Keith Samuel Siegel, Tsahi Idan, Ofer Calderon, Tal Shoham, Doron Steinbrecher, Omer Shem-Tov, Itzik Elgarat, Hisham al-Sayed, and Eli Sharabi.

British, Israeli soccer teams celebrate return of Hamas hostage, ...	Tottenham fans have shown solidarity with Damari many times since she was kidnapped in 2023 by releasing yellow balloons in her honor, hanging posters about her, and tying hundreds of yellow ribbons around the team’s home stadium. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The English Premier League soccer team Tottenham Spurs and the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team in Israel celebrated the return home of British-Israeli dual citizen Emily Damari as one of the three civilian hostages who were released from Hamas captivity on Sunday as part of the ceasefire deal between Israel and the terrorist organization. Damari, a 28-year-old passionate Tottenham supporter, as well as Nova music festival survivor Romi Gonen, 23, and veterinary nurse Doron Steinbrecher, 30, returned to Israel on Sunday morning after being abducted more than 15 months ago during the Hamas-led terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Damari, the only British hostage still in captivity, and Steinbrecher were both kidnapped from their homes in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. On Sunday, the official account on X for Tottenham supporters in Israel shared a photo of Damari and the caption read, 'Emily is coming home TODAY! #ShesOneOfOurOwn.' At several soccer matches since Damari’s abduction, fans of the north London team have chanted 'Emily Damari, she’s one of our own, she’s one of our own, Emily Damari, bring her home.' Former Tottenham player Ramon Vega also shared his excitement about Damari’s return. After Tottenham loss to Everton 3-2 on Sunday, the 53-year-old Swiss soccer player wrote on X: 'At least one positive thought today from the Spurs family! Welcome home, Emily. COYS Spurs!' At least one positive thought today from the Spurs family! Welcome home, Emily. COYS Spurs! &mdash; Ramon Vega (@Ramon_Vega71) January 19, 2025 Tottenham fans have shown solidarity with Damari many times since she was kidnapped in 2023. They released yellow balloons in her honor, hung posters about her, and tied hundreds of yellow ribbons around the team’s home stadium. Last week, Arsenal and Tottenham fans united in support of Damari at the north London derby. Maccabi Tel Aviv additionally celebrated Damari’s return home on Sunday. 'Our Emily is back home!' the team wrote in a Hebrew-language post on Instagram. 'We waited and prayed for 471 days for your return and today the heart is filled with happiness that you are back with us together with Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbercher.' Former Maccabi Tel Aviv player Yonatan Cohen, who now plays for the Australian team Melbourne City, also commented on Damari’s return in a Hebrew-language post on Instagram and revealed that he has been in contact with her family since her abduction. 'After the cursed day of October 7, when Emily was taken, her family reached out to me and told me about her — her joy for life, her strength, and the light she brought everywhere she went. Her story deeply touched me, and since that day, I’ve been in regular contact with her family. Emily has been on my mind constantly,' he wrote on Instagram. 'For every match, in every stadium, I wore a shirt with her picture on it, and I prayed every day that she would return to her beloved family. With every goal and every happy moment, I wished in my heart for her to smile her big smile again. When we moved to Australia, I packed her shirt with me, and I’ve been waiting ever since for the day she would become a symbol of our victory.' 'Emily’s touching comeback, full of pride and joy, is not just a victory for her family and the people of Israel — it is a victory of faith and of hope, that the good will always win,' Cohen added. 'Emily and family, today I’m excited to send you a strong hug from afar and wish you to quickly return to normal, wrapped in the warmth and love of your family and relatives. I’m already waiting to see each other when I get back to Israel. You are our victory!' The Israeli soccer team Hapoel Haifa shared several messages on social media celebrating the return of the three hostages with special attention given to Gonen, an avid fan of the team who they’ve honored in previous matches. Hapoel Haifa team members and its coach recorded a personal video message for Gonen, welcoming her back home. They also offered her free season tickets and a shirt bearing her name. Hapoel Haifa said that on Monday, before its match against M.S. Ashdod, it will hold a ceremony to celebrate the return of the three hostages.

Trump to immediately halt funding to UNRWA	The executive order is one of several expected to be signed by Trump during his first week back in office. By Jewish Breaking News Former President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order halting U.S. foreign assistance immediately upon assuming office for a second term, with UNRWA reportedly at the top of the list. UNRWA, the United Nations agency responsible for distributing aid in Gaza, has faced repeated accusations of ties to Hamas. The UN recently admitted that nine of its staff may have been involved in the October 7 attack on Israel. 'The United States and American citizens have been some of the most generous people in the entire world,' an incoming White House policy adviser stated. 'But at this point, we have to understand that foreign policy is domestic policy, and if this is not aligned with our interests, then Uncle Sam should not be opening up his pocketbook any longer.' The executive order is one of several expected to be signed by Trump during his first week back in office. Other anticipated directives include: Removing insubordinate government employees. Reversing Joe Biden’s green energy projects. Keeping TikTok operational. Declaring a state of emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. Ending 'catch and release' immigration policies. Designating Mexican drug cartels as 'foreign terrorist organizations.' Trump’s administration has signaled an aggressive approach to fulfilling campaign promises and reshaping U.S. foreign and domestic priorities.

‘The circle has closed’: 10 years after falling in combat, Oron S...	Before the funeral, Zehava Shaul met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and expressed her gratitude for recovering the body. By TPS Thousands gathered today to pay their last respects to Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul, whose body was recovered from Gaza on Sunday. Shaul, who would be 34 today, was killed on July 20, 2014 in Gaza City’s Shejaya neighborhood. He and six other soldiers were killed when their armored personnel carrier was attacked by anti-tank missiles. He was laid to rest in the northern Israeli community of Poriya. 'After so many years, I can’t believe it is happening. I still have not proceeded the fact that you are here, and that we saying good bye to you,' Oron’s brother, Ofek said. 'This hurting, devastating journey of us has come to an end,' Ofek Shaul said. 'We are sad and happy. We should be happy that you can finally rest in the place you loved so much. The circle has closed today.' Another brother, Aviram, mentioned that Oron had insisted on being drafted into a combat unit despite having health issues. 'The whole country holds its breath and salutes you today,' Aviram said. Their mother Zehava Shaul said she was grateful to all those who made the funeral possible. 'I did not believe he would return. I thank everybody – the IDF, the Shin Bet, the Prime Minister – that they did one good thing and brought you to me,' she said. Before the funeral, Zehava Shaul met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and expressed her gratitude for recovering the body. In his eulogy, President Isaac Herzog said, 'He always knew that he was fighting for his nation, his country, for the light.' Herzog reiterated Israel’s commitment to leaving no soldier behind and apologized for the lengthy wait to bring Oron home. He also assured the family of Lt.

Poll: 21% of US voters support Hamas over Israel in conflict	The Harvard/Harris survey also found that a majority of the American public believes that the negotiations led by the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump led to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. By JNS Twenty-one percent of American voters say they support Hamas over Israel in Jerusalem’s ongoing war against the U.S.-designated terrorist organization, according to a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll published over the weekend. Harvard/Harris surveyed a representative sample of 2,650 registered voters on Jan. 15-16. (The reported margin of error for the total sample is plus or minus 1.9 percentage points at a confidence level of 95%.) Asked 'Do you support more Israel or more Hamas?' in the war, 75% of Democrats backed the Jewish state, while 25% expressed more approval for the Palestinian terrorist group. Among Republican voters, 81% said they supported Jerusalem more, compared to 19% for Hamas. Support for Hamas polled the highest among the 25 to 34 age group, where almost one-third said they favored the terrorists over Israel. The Harvard/Harris survey also found that a majority of the American public believes that the negotiations led by the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump led to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. Fifty-seven percent of respondents said that Hamas 'agreed to the deal because of negotiations' led by Trump’s team, compared to 43% who thought that outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden made it happen. Eighty-four percent of Republicans said Trump was responsible, compared to 75% of Democrats who thought that Biden’s negotiations led Hamas to accept the truce. Among independent voters, 60% credited Trump and 40% Biden. The vast majority of respondents, 82%, said they backed 'the ceasefire deal reached between Israel and Hamas which aims to end the war in Gaza and release hostages.' Support for the deal was higher among Democrats, 87% of whom said they backed the deal, with 81% of Republicans expressing approval. Trump on Sunday evening hailed the ceasefire agreement as a 'first step toward lasting peace in the Middle East.' Speaking at a rally hours before being inaugurated as the 47th president of the United States, Trump called the agreement that freed hostages Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari 'epic.' 'This week, we achieved an epic ceasefire agreement as a first step toward lasting peace in the Middle East. And this agreement could only have happened as a result of our historic victory in November,' he told attendees at the Capitol One Arena in Washington, D.C. 'I’m glad to report that the first hostages have just been released,' he added. 'Our incoming administration has achieved all of this in the Middle East in less than three months without being president. We’ve achieved more without being president than they’ve achieved in four years with being president,' Trump said, thanking incoming Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. 'He’s an amazing guy. I said: I got to get myself a negotiator. We have to get a good negotiator. A lot of guys are knowledgeable, but they can’t negotiate. They don’t have the personality or whatever,' said Trump. 'And Steve does, and Steve’s a great negotiator, very successful guy, but he’s our new special envoy to the Middle East for helping reach this great breakthrough, and really couldn’t have been done without Steve.' Israel reportedly signaled its support for the deal—which calls for the release of thousands of terrorists and an Israel Defense Forces withdrawal from strategic areas in the Gaza Strip—after being pressured by Witkoff.

These pardons remain controversial as the individuals involved have not been charged but played pivotal roles in contentious events of recent years. By Jewish Breaking News None of those pardoned are known to have been found guilty of any pardonable crimes, but these are being viewed as preemptive pardons. Gen.

Hamas claims victory while admitting leadership decimated by Isra...	PA slams rival, saying the release of even 2,000 prisoners was not worth the price Gazans paid in deaths, injuries and six times more being arrested by Israel forces. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hamas claimed victory Sunday after a ceasefire went into effect in the Gaza Strip, while admitting that almost its entire leadership was decimated by the IDF in the last 15 months of war. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Hezbollah-owned Al Manar TV that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'thought he was able to end the resistance in Gaza&#8230;. But he failed, and the resistance remained steadfast in the field, and even attained achievements that are recorded for it.' Hamdan’s definition of achieving a win was that Israel 'was forced to negotiate with' Hamas, and 'wanted to recover its prisoners by force, but it could not achieve that except through negotiations, while the resistance remained steadfast on the ground by the will of its people.' He also couched the loss of almost the whole top political and military echelon of both Hamas and Hezbollah to IDF forces as being 'natural for the leaders of the resistance to lead the ranks of the martyrs.' Among the names he listed of his own organization were Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by IDF soldiers in Gaza, deputy leader of Hamas’ political bureau, Saleh Al-Arouri, who was assassinated in an airstrike in Beirut, and Marwan Issa, the deputy head of Hamas's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, who was considered Hamas’ No. 3 leader, in an airstrike in Gaza. Although both Israel and the U.S. had confirmed Issa’s death last March, this was the first time a Hamas official admitted the fact. Hamdan also hinted that Hamas was not deterred by its losses, saying that 'the battle area was Gaza, but it was not a battle for Gaza alone, but a battle to liberate Palestine and Jerusalem, and it is the beginning of the great liberation process.' Hamdan’s triumphant pose was mocked by its bitter nationalist rival, the Palestinian Authority (PA), whose popularity in the area of Judea and Samaria that it controls is very much eclipsed by Hamas. In an interview with the Saudi al-Arabiya channel, Mahmoud al-Habash, an adviser to PA President Mahmoud Abbas, said that in exchange for the expected release of perhaps 1,500 to 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed, 120,000 had been injured, and more than 13,000 Palestinians had been arrested by Israel over the course of the war. The arrests al-Habash mentioned were made by the IDF both in the Gaza Strip and the PA, with about a third of the terrorists caught in Judea and Samaria being members of the Islamist Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and most of the rest belonging to the PA’s own Fatah movement. Hamdan then demanded that Hamas acknowledge that it failed, instead of using 'empty slogans about victory.' As he noted in a separate interview with the Saudi Al-Hadath channel, the end result of 15 months of war was a tripling of the number of Palestinians prisoners now held in Israeli jails. 'Have their goals been achieved, or do they see that what happened on October 7 achieved what they wanted when Hamas did what they did?' he also asked, while deliberately obscuring the fact that the terrorists had massacred, raped and burned to death 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians, in their surprise invasion of southern Israel. 'Did we win by losing our loved ones?' he asked rhetorically, and went on to accuse Hamas of 'using' the 'sacred cause' of the Palestinians 'just to achieve political gains that may not be yours,' in a veiled reference to Iran, Hamas’ main financial backer and arms supplier. What Iran has long called its 'axis of resistance' against Israel, 'was exposed as an empty axis that has no value or meaning' and is instead 'a trader in the Palestinian people,' who are 'now facing a major catastrophe,' he added.

‘Don’t negotiate with terrorists’ – Republican senator blasts hos...	We didn't' negotiate with Japan' - Republican senator blasts hostage deal with Hamas, blames Joe Biden's pressure on Israel during Gaza war for failure to secure hostages' release early on. By World Israel News Staff Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas condemned the hostage deal and ceasefire reached between Israel and the Hamas terror organization in brokered talks in Doha, Qatar last week, and castigated the Biden administration's handling of the Gaza war. Speaking with Fox News' Mark Levin on Saturday, Cotton said the deal with Hamas created a dangerous precedent of negotiating with terrorist organizations, saying the U.S. should have backed Israel's position throughout the war seeking the unconditional defeat of Hamas and return of the hostages. 'We shouldn't negotiate with terrorists. We shouldn't ask Israel or any other country to negotiate with terrorists. You know we didn't negotiate with Japan after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We said unconditional surrender and release the 40,000 Americans you hold, and that's what they did,' Cotton said. Cotton, a pro-Israel stalwart who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Republican Conference, blamed President Joe Biden for the failure to secure the release of the remaining hostages prior to last week's deal, citing the administration's pressure on Israel and restrictions on arms transfers during the Gaza war. 'We wouldn't be in this position here in January of 2025, if that's the position Joe Biden had taken in October of 2023. If we had simply backed Israel to the hilt, from the beginning of this war, providing Israel the weapons that it needed, when it needed them, and in the quantities that it needed them, and certainly not putting diplomatic and political pressure on Israel to cut bad deals for the last 15 months, and in all of these exit speeches and exit interviews.' 'We should have simply backed Israel from the beginning of the war, provided it with the weapons it needed when it needed them, and not exerted political and diplomatic pressure on Israel to sign bad deals.' Cotton cited Biden's Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who recently acknowledged that Hamas had responded to foreign pressure on Israel by toughening its position in talks or withdrawing from the negotiations altogether. 'Blinken admitted that every time international pressure was exerted on Israel, it caused Hamas to distance itself from the negotiations or raise more baseless demands.' 'The reason we are in a situation where there are still about 100 hostages left in Gaza is that Joe Biden was a weak and failed president who did not support Israel.' 'Tony Blinken has admitted that every time U.S. or international pressure was brought to bear on Israel, it caused Hamas to walk away from the table or to make more unreasonable demands, because they thought that Joe Biden or European leaders would put the pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu that Hamas couldn't on the battlefield.' 'So the reason we're in this position, where there are still almost a 100 hostages left in Gaza, seven of whom are American, is because Joe Biden has been a weak, failed president, who hasn't backed Israel.'

Yemen’s Houthis signal they’ll now limit their attacks in the Red...	The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. By The Associated Press Yemen's Houthi rebels have signaled they now will limit their attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships, just as a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip entered its second day Monday. The Houthis' announcement, made in an email sent to shippers and others on Sunday, likely won't be enough to encourage global firms to reenter the route that's crucial for cargo and energy shipments moving between Asia and Europe. Their attacks have halved traffic through the region, cutting deeply into revenues for Egypt, which runs the Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. 'The ceasefire is considered fragile,' said Jakob P. Larsen, the head of maritime security for BIMCO, the largest international association representing shipowners. 'It is assessed that even minor deviations from the ceasefire agreements could lead to hostilities, which would subsequently prompt the Houthis to again direct threats against a broader range of international shipping.' The Houthis separately planned a military statement on Monday, likely about the decision. The Houthis made the announcement through their Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center, saying it was 'stopping sanctions' on the other vessels it has previously targeted since November 2023. For Israeli ships, those 'sanctions &#8230; will be stopped upon the full implementation of all phases' of the ceasefire, it added. However, the center-left opened resuming attacks against both the United States and the United Kingdom, which have launched airstrikes targeting the rebels over their seaborne assaults. 'In the event of any aggression &#8230; the sanctions will be reinstated against the aggressor state,' the center said. 'You will be promptly informed of such measures should they be implemented.' The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. The Iranian-backed Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels had maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked had little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The tempo of Houthi attacks has slowed in recent weeks, particularly involving ships at sea. That may be due in part to the U.S. airstrike campaign. The U.S. and its partners alone have struck the Houthis over 260 times, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. However, the rebels had continued to launch drones and missiles targeting Israel, which has warned it will continue to strike Houthi leadership. Another wild card is President Donald Trump after he is inaugurated Monday. He may reapply a foreign terrorist organization designation on the Houthis that President Joe Biden revoked, which could spark attacks again. 'Uncertainty is further exacerbated by today’s inauguration of Trump,' Larsen said. 'It remains unclear how the Trump administration will act in the conflict with the Houthis and whether potential punitive actions against them will be considered.'

Donald Trump to be sworn in as 47th president	Breaking with diplomatic custom, Trump has extended invitations to several international leaders, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, Argentine President Javier Milei, and Chinese President Xi Jinping. By Jewish Breaking News Marking an unprecedented return to the White House after a four-year absence, history will be made today as Donald Trump is sworn in at 12 noon as the 47th President of the United States. In a last-minute change announced Friday, the inauguration ceremony will move inside the Capitol building due to frigid temperatures, as opposed to the traditional West Lawn venue overlooking the National Mall. Despite the change affecting the distribution of over 220,000 public tickets, Trump has assured supporters they can watch via live feed at Washington’s Capital One Arena where he plans to make an appearance later. The guest list includes former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, though notably, Michelle Obama will be absent. Both Hillary Clinton and Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump defeated in different presidential races will both be in attendance. Silicon Valley will be well represented as well, with tech titans Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and TikTok CEO Shou Chew joining as VIP guests. Breaking with diplomatic custom, Trump has extended invitations to several international leaders, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, Argentine President Javier Milei, and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Chief Justice John Roberts will administer the oath of office to Trump for the second time, while J.D. Vance will be sworn in as Vice President. Following the constitutional proceedings, Trump will deliver his inaugural address in the Rotunda of the Capitol. The last time a president took the oath of office inside was Ronald Reagan during his second inauguration in 1985, also due to extremely cold weather. Following the indoor ceremony, Trump will participate in the traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. It might be hard to find tickets this late for Trump 2.0, as this year’s inauguration day will feature top celebrity performers. Country music star Carrie Underwood will perform 'America the Beautiful' during tomorrow’s inauguration ceremony, while Lee Greenwood will deliver his patriotic anthem 'God Bless the USA.' Three official inaugural balls will showcase performances by Jason Aldean, Rascal Flatts, Gavin DeGraw, and the Village People. Last night, a pre-inauguration rally featured the Village People performing their classic 'YMCA,' alongside Kid Rock and Billy Ray Cyrus. With Trump’s return to office, Israeli officials are expressing renewed optimism particularly after yesterday’s release of three hostages. U.S. officials warn that Hamas must honor its ceasefire agreement, or face what Trump himself stated, 'all hell will break loose.'

‘Part of them is still in that tunnel’: Freed hostages begin comp...	Six hospitals nationwide are prepared for hostage reception—four in central Israel and two near the border with Gaza—along with a multidisciplinary expert team assembled to conduct the examinations. By Maytal Yasur Beit-Or, JNS Emily Damari (28), Doron Steinbrecher (31) and Romi Gonen (24) have begun their journey back to life at Sheba Medical Center following 471 days in Hamas captivity. Medical teams, having spent months preparing for the hostages’ return, prioritized the family reunions while establishing the foundation for an intricate medical and psychological rehabilitation process. Following the hostages’ return yesterday, Hospital Director Dr. Yael Frankel Nir announced: 'I am deeply moved to report that we have received the three hostages. Their medical condition allows us to focus on family reunification. We will proceed with examinations in the coming days. We had the privilege of meeting them … and we continue this journey until the last hostage returns.' Dr. Sefi Mendlovich, Deputy Director General of the Israeli Health Ministry, stated: 'Today we welcome Emily, Doron, and Romi after 471 days in Hamas captivity. This represents an unimaginable reality. We, as medical authorities within the healthcare system, stand fully prepared to address all medical conditions.' Immediate priority: Nutrition The primary medical concern currently centers on refeeding syndrome. Following 15 months of malnutrition, sudden food reintroduction risks dangerous disruptions to the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance. Previous hostage exchanges revealed weight losses of between 10% to 17% of body mass, translating to 17-33 pounds. Given the three women’s extended period in captivity, the medical team anticipates even more complex challenges. Consequently, they must undergo extensive medical evaluation. The established medical protocol encompasses comprehensive testing: infectious disease screening, thorough nutritional assessment including vitamin levels, potassium, zinc and vitamin B12, pregnancy testing for women of reproductive age, blood clot screening—a condition previously observed in hostages due to prolonged immobility—and detailed examinations of neurological, respiratory and cardiac function. Systematic readiness Six hospitals nationwide are prepared for hostage reception—four in central Israel and two near the border with Gaza. Health Ministry guidelines recommend a minimum four-day hospitalization, allowing for necessary testing and gradual adjustment. A multidisciplinary expert team was assembled to conduct the hostage examinations. The hospital deploys specialists across various fields: ophthalmologists assessing vision after extended darkness exposure, gynecologists performing comprehensive examinations, geriatric specialists evaluating prolonged immobility effects, dentists addressing captivity-related dental issues and mental health professionals providing immediate and long-term psychological support. Specialized psychological care 'We face both emotional and medical complexities,' emphasized Dr. Frankel-Nir. 'The care system we’ve developed is based on past experiences and insights from previous events.' The mental health team is focused on giving the returnees and their families privacy and peace, making sure they’re not overwhelmed by outside stresses or too many visitors. The care system extends beyond hospital discharge, continuing into community care. 'We’ve developed a comprehensive ongoing care program,' Dr. Mendlovich explained. 'Our aim is facilitating smooth transitions from hospitalization to daily life while maintaining thorough medical and psychological monitoring.' ‘Part of them is still in the tunnel’ Professor Hagai Levine, head of Health Services at the Hostages’ Families and Missing Forum, told Israel Hayom on Monday morning that recovery for the released hostages began the moment they were released, but will be a lifelong journey. 'Mentally, part of them is still in that tunnel,' he explained. 'They spent so long with their fellow hostages that they feel guilty about doing anything enjoyable—even though they should be able to. This sense of guilt toward those still in captivity is holding back their recovery.' Professor Levine noted that this extends to the families of those who’ve returned—they remain deeply involved in fighting for the release of those still held captive, driven by the same sense of obligation. 'Even Israeli society as a whole can’t fully move forward—and understandably so—while people are still focused on bringing everyone home.' Both the hostages’ physical and mental health will need to be addressed, said Levine. 'Physically, we check for various medical conditions—in past cases, we’ve found blood clots in leg veins, hormone imbalances and malnutrition. We screen for vitamin and mineral deficiencies, weight loss and skin problems. Some patients need physical therapy. On the psychological side, there’s a long road ahead—rebuilding trust and helping them regain a sense of control over their lives.' After suffering such trauma, a significant social adjustment will be required for the hostages to reintegrate back into their former lives, he explained. 'They need to relearn how to navigate everyday interactions and eventually return to work. It’s a complex, long-term recovery process that affects both the released hostages and their families. But full recovery is particularly challenging while others remain in captivity—they find it impossible to focus entirely on their own healing while knowing others are still held hostage.'

Israel poised to strike Iran’s nuclear program – report	Senior European diplomat claims Israel has already decided to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities, as European powers reach out to incoming Trump administration in bid to pressure Israel to hold off on attack. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli government has settled on a plan to strike Iran's nuclear facilities sometime in the near future, a senior European diplomat claims. On Friday, the Saudi-based Al Arabiya news outlet reported that European powers are growing increasingly concerned that Israel may attempt to bomb Iranian nuclear sites following President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday. A number of European governments have, according to the report, reached out to the Trump transition team, hoping to enlist the new administration's support in pressuring Israel not to carry out the planned strikes. One senior European diplomat told the outlet that Israel has already decided on the strikes, following months of deliberations. 'We believe Israel has taken the decision to attack following the developments in the Middle East over the last several months,' the diplomat was quoted as saying. The source did not claim that the Israeli attacks are imminent, but emphasized anxiety among European leaders regarding the prospect of such airstrikes sometime in the near future. Representatives from Germany, France, and Britain held talks with Iran last Monday regarding Tehran's nuclear program, following low-key talks last November. Last month, Britain, France, and Germany expressed 'extreme concern' over Iran's burgeoning uranium enrichment capabilities. Following President-elect Donald Trump's election in November, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan reportedly briefed President Joe Biden on options for American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, should Tehran attempt a sudden nuclear breakout. Given its current uranium enrichment levels, Iran's nuclear program is estimated to be as little as one week away from achieving the level of uranium enrichment necessary for an atomic bomb.

Izz al-Din Haddad emerges as key figure in Hamas’s rebuilding eff...	Israeli officials view Haddad as the successor to Mohammed Deif, who was killed in an airstrike in July. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Izz al-Din Haddad, commander of Hamas’s Northern Brigade, oversaw Sunday’s transfer of three Israeli hostages to the Red Cross and is viewed as a rising figure as the terror group looks to rebuild itself. Haddad, who helped plan and command the October 7 attacks, is currently tasked with rebuilding Hamas’s civilian governance and military capabilities, opening government offices, recruiting police volunteers, and managing the Netzarim corridor. An estimated 20,000 terrorists from Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other terror groups have been killed in the war. Haddad gained prominence during the seven-week war in Gaza in 2014 following Hamas’s kidnap and murder of three Israeli teens. On July 20, 2014, Haddad led a battle in which Hamas ambushed an Israeli armored personnel carrier in Shejaya killing seven soldiers and capturing the body of Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul. Shaul’s body was recovered by Israeli forces on Sunday. After the battle, Haddad was promoted to commander of Hamas’s Gaza Brigade, and he continued rising through the terror group’s ranks. Haddad was elevated to oversee Gaza’s northern and central regions after Ahmed al-Ghandour was eliminated in a November 2023 airstrike. Israeli officials view Haddad as the successor to Mohammed Deif, who was killed in an airstrike in July. Yahya Sinwar’s brother Mohammed, is Hamas’s de facto leader in Gaza. Following Sunday’s return of hostages Doron Steinbrecher, Romi Gonen and Emily Damari, Israel released 90 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists to their homes in Judea, Samaria and eastern Jerusalem. During the first phase of the ceasefire, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian terrorists in exchange for 30 captives. The exact number of terrorists released will depend on how many of the hostages are alive.

IDF soldier killed by roadside bomb in northern Samaria	Three more Israeli soldiers sustained injuries of various degrees in the incident, which took place in the Palestinian town of Tammun, northeast of the city of Nablus. By JNS Israel Defense Forces Sgt. 1st class (res.) Eviatar Ben Yehuda, 31, from Nitzan in the country’s south, was killed during 'operational activities' in northern Samaria, the military announced on Monday morning. An officer in Ben Yehuda’s unit, the 8211 Reserve Battalion of the IDF’s Ephraim Brigade, was seriously wounded in the same incident, according to military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. Three more Israeli soldiers sustained injuries of various degrees in the incident, which took place in the Palestinian town of Tammun, northeast of the city of Nablus (Shechem), according to Ynet. The soldiers had been traveling in a vehicle that hit an explosive device, according to the report. Last week, five members of the IDF’s Nahal Brigade were killed fighting Hamas in northern Gaza, according to the military. A truce with the Palestinian terrorist group went into effect at 11:15 a.m. on Sunday. The death toll among troops since the start of the IDF ground incursion in Gaza on Oct. 27, 2023, currently stands at 408, and at 841 on all fronts since the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Additionally, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage-rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Emily Damari, one of the three women released on the first day of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire Sunday, came out of captivity with two fingers missing on her hand. During the Hamas takeover of her kibbutz, Kfar Aza, the dual British-Israeli citizen had attempted to hide under her bed, but the terrorists caught her and at some point in the assault they blew off the two middle fingers of her left hand. The 27-year-old had also had shrapnel in her leg, her mother, Mandy, born in Beckenham, a town south of London, told British Jewish paper The JC Monday. 'I know at the beginning she was treated for her gunshot wound, but very shortly afterwards they just threw bandages at her and told her to treat herself,' she said, and her daughter was not given 'any other medication' by the terrorists who held her. In pictures of the reunion of Damari and her family after she arrived back in Israel, her hand could be seen heavily and professionally bandaged after being taken care of by IDF physicians. Damari already posted a story to Instagram Monday morning, to thank everyone and reveal a bit of her feelings about being free. 'I love, love, love,' she wrote, thanking God, her family, and 'the best friends one could possibly have in this world. I have returned to my beloved life.' 'I’ve managed to see just a tiny part of everything and my heart is bursting from all of the emotion. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I am the happiest person in the world just to be,' she concluded. She then added the emoji of a hand with the thumb, forefinger and pinkie up, which is a shortcut signal in sign language for 'I love you,' and now also symbolizes her own hand. Damari was not only 'the glue' that held all her friends together, as one of her best friends described her, and was an optimistic person, according to her mother, who was told by hostages freed six weeks into the war that Emily tried to help them in their dire circumstances. She was also mentally and physically tough, having done her service in the IDF in the Border Police, and continuing to do reserve duty after her mandatory stint was completed. When her mother traveled the globe in her unending efforts to raise awareness about the hostages and beg for world leaders’ help in releasing them, this aspect of her daughter’s history was deliberately left out in an effort to minimize the harm it could cause her in Hamas’ hands. Damari was not alone in Gaza, as Romi Gonen (24), who had been abducted from the Nova dance festival, was with her during their entire 15-month-long ordeal. It is not yet known if the third hostage released Sunday, Doron Steinbrecher (31), a dual Romanian-Israeli citizen who was also from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, was held with other hostages during any period of her captivity.

Released hostage Emily Damari lost two fingers during Oct. 7 inva...	She and Romi Gonen, who was freed with her, were together the whole time in captivity in Gaza. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Emily Damari, one of the three women released on the first day of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire Sunday, came out of captivity with two fingers missing on her hand.

Trump responsible for securing hostage deal, most Americans say	New poll shows vast majority of Americans support Israel over Hamas, while a similarly wide majority support the ceasefire deal in the Gaza Strip, with most Americans crediting Trump rather than Biden for the agreement. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A majority of Americans credit President-elect Donald Trump with securing last week's agreement between Israel and Hamas, as opposed to President Joe Biden. According to a poll published on Saturday by Harvard CAPS / HarrisX, which surveyed 2,650 registered voters last Wednesday and Thursday, just 39% of registered voters approve of President Biden's job performance at the end of his single term in office. By contrast, more than half (53%) of registered voters approve of President-elect Donald Trump's performance thus far, before inauguration day. While both Trump and Biden took credit for the hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire, which went into effect on Sunday, 57% of Americans - and 60% of independents - say Hamas agreed to the deal because of the influence of the incoming Trump administration, while 43% said Biden's negotiations had the largest impact. Two-thirds (66%) of voters back Trump's call to end the conflict in the Gaza Strip by 'demanding the full surrender of Hamas and the return of hostages,' while 34% of voters oppose it. A large majority (79%) of Americans say they back Israel over Hamas, with 21% favoring the terror organization. Republicans were slightly more likely to back Israel over Hamas, 81% to 19%, than Democrats, where the margin was 75% to 25%. Independents backed Israel 80% to 20%. Voters over 65 were most likely to back Israel, with 90% saying they supported the Jewish state over Hamas, compared to just 68% of voters between the ages of 25 and 34. However, the youngest cohort of voters, 18-24 year-olds, backed Israel over Hamas by a margin of 79% to 21%. Eighty-two percent of voters say they support the ceasefire deal in Gaza, including 87% of Democrats, 81% of Republicans, and 78% of independents.

Trump: ‘Biden didn’t achieve the hostage deal – my election did’	Hours before being sworn into office, President-elect Donald Trump hails 'epic ceasefire agreement' between Israel and Hamas, claiming it will lead to 'lasting peace in the Middle East.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump lauded the implementation of the hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire on Sunday, while rejecting President Joe Biden's claims that he was responsible for securing the long-sought agreement. Just hours before his inauguration on Monday, Trump addressed a rally in Washington D.C. on Sunday, vowing an end to 'America's decline.' During the event, Trump took credit for the deal reached between Israel and the Hamas terror organization in talks in Doha, Qatar last week, hours after President Biden touted the achievement shortly after three Israeli women - Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari - were transferred from Hamas back to Israel via the Red Cross. The incoming president also hailed the deal as heralding a fundamental shift in the Middle East. 'This week, we achieved an epic ceasefire agreement as a first step toward lasting peace in the Middle East — and this agreement could only have happened as a result of our historic victory in November,' Trump said. 'I’m glad to report that the first hostages have just been released, and who knows what’s going to happen.' 'I know that Biden is saying that he made the deal,' Trump continued, blaming his 2020 election opponent for the October 7th, 2023 invasion. 'First of all, [it] would have never happened if I were President. It would have never happened. There was not even a thought of it. Iran was broke, it had no money for Hezbollah, they had no money for Hamas. They had no money. They were broke. Totally broke.' Trump lauded his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, for his role in pressing Qatar and Israel in the final stages of talks. 'He’s an amazing guy. I said, ‘We have to get a good negotiator.’ A lot of guys are knowledgeable but they can’t negotiate. They don’t have the personality or whatever. And Steve does, and Steve’s a great negotiator…this breakthrough really couldn’t have been done without Steve.' 'Our incoming administration achieved all of this in the Middle East, in less than three months, without being President. We’ve achieved more without being President than they’ve achieved in four years with being President.'

Gazans praise Hamas after ceasefire ‘victory’	Gazans, who took to the streets to celebrate, waved Hamas flags and chanted slogans in support of the terror group. By World Israel News Staff Footage of the transfer of three Israeli hostages from Hamas captivity to the Red Cross revealed a stark reality in the Gaza Strip - after nearly 15 months of war, the Hamas terror group appears to remain firmly in control of the coastal enclave. In video shot from the scene, armed Hamas gunmen can be seen as the sole security force maintaining order, as mobs of Gazans attempted to reach the vehicles carrying released hostages Romi Gonen, Emily Damari, and Doron Steinbrecher. Gazans, who took to the streets to celebrate the ceasefire and prisoner releases, waved Hamas flags and chanted slogans in support of the terror group. As the IDF pulled back from numerous positions throughout the Strip and IDF aircraft ceased to fly overhead, Gazans thanked their leadership - the Hamas terror group - on social media for ending the conflict. 'How beautiful is the sky without planes,' one Gazan commenter wrote, according to a Jerusalem Post report. 'The sound of the drones killed us,' another Gazan responded. An anonymous resident of Gaza told the Post that despite the outward expressions of joy over the ceasefire, he and many others in the territory are furious at Hamas for the destruction they have wrought. 'I am a crushed human being living in Gaza, where I did not choose the war nor did I contribute to its outbreak, but I found myself trapped in a circle of death that haunts me every day. My life here has become dangerous, and all I seek is survival,' he told the Post. Israel 'handed us over to Hamas… May Allah take revenge. Where would we escape from the persecution and threats during the ceasefire?' In a clip that went viral, an older woman was seen scolding a man who was handing out sweets to celebrate Hamas' 'victory.' 'How can you celebrate when so many of our people have been killed?' she asks.

Who are the terrorists freed by Israel in the ceasefire deal?	Released prisoners dropped off near Ramallah, greeted by cheering crowds waving Hamas, Islamic Jihad flags. By World Israel News Staff Terrorists who shot and stabbed Israeli civilians are among the first 90 prisoners released by Israel, in exchange for the return of three Israeli captives kidnapped on October 7th, 2023. Around 90 people convicted of terror offenses, most of them women, were released from Ofer Prison hours after Hamas handed over Romi Gonen, Emily Damari, and Doron Steinbrecher to the Red Cross. The prisoners were bussed from Ofer Prison to the Ramallah area, where most of them reunited with their families and made their way home. 78 of the prisoners are residents of Palestinian Authority-controlled municipalities in Judea and Samaria. 12 prisoners, who are residents of eastern Jerusalem, were later bussed to the city. Hundreds gathered at the drop-off point near Ramallah, cheering on the released prisoners as they arrived during the early hours of Monday morning. Many in the crowd waved the flags of terror groups, including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Fatah, and Hezbollah. Hebrew and Arabic-language media reports regarding the gender breakdown of the prisoners were contradictory, with some indicating there were 62 women, while others saying there were 69 women among the 90 inmates who were released. Numerous prisoners who attempted to murder Israelis were set free in the exchange. Mahmoud Aliowat, 15, shot two Israelis in the Old City of Jerusalem in 2022. He spent less than three years in prison for the attempted murders. Ibrahim Zamar, who shot two people in the Sheikh Jarrah (Shimon HaTzadik) neighborhood in April 2023 when he was 15, was freed. Nawal Abed Fatiha, who holds Israeli citizenship, stabbed a 70=year-old Jerusalem man in 2020. He was freed after less than five years of incarceration. Khalida Jarrar, 62, a senior member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) terror group, was also freed in the exchange. She is believed to have masterminded a terror bombing which killed Rina Schnerb, 19, in 2019.

‘Allah loves the patient’ – Arab MK in cryptic post	The concept of patience, or steadfastness, is commonly promoted among Palestinian nationalists as a fundamental ideal in their battle to destroy the Jewish State. By World Israel News Staff An anti-Israel Arab lawmaker posted an ominous statement on his Facebook page moments, hours after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect, writing 'Allah loves the patient' in Arabic. MK Ahmad Tibi, a member of the anti-Zionist Ta'al party, has long supported Palestinian terror and justified deadly attacks against Israel. On Sunday evening, Tibi published a short message on his Facebook page, which read 'Allah loves the patient.' The concept of patience, or steadfastness, is commonly promoted among Palestinian nationalists as a fundamental ideal in their battle to destroy the Jewish State. For example, a Hamas spokesman praised Gazans for their 'steadfastness' in a media statement shortly after the ceasefire was declared. Social media users did not ignore the implications of Tibi's tweet, which appeared express support for a long-term struggle against Israel. 'When the Supreme Court is on your side, you feel safe' to post inflammatory statements, wrote one user. Many noted that as a member of the Knesset, Tibi receives a salary which is funded by the Israeli taxpayer. 'We are so lame,' wrote one Israeli user. 'We let them walk all over us, and we're actually funding this!' Tibi's colleague, MK Ayman Odeh, sparked controversy with his own social media post on Sunday evening. Odeh, who has often met with inmates convicted of terrorism offenses, drew a moral equivalency between the release of Israelis kidnapped by Hamas and incarcerated Palestinians. In a tweet, Odeh wrote that he was 'happy for the release of the hostages and prisoners' as part of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. 'Now we must free both peoples from the yoke of occupation. We were all born free,' he added. Otzma Yehudit MK Yitzhak Wasserlauf, who recently resigned from the government over his party's opposition to the ceasefire and hostage deal, responded to Odeh on social media platform X. 'At this time, when the entire Israeli nation — supporters and opponents of the deal alike — are weeping with excitement over the return of Romi, Emily and Doron, terrorist supporter Ayman Odeh is comparing vile murderers to our kidnapped daughters,' Wasserlauf wrote.

Hamas terrorists mock female hostages, release them with ‘goodie ...	The staged ceremony and its accompanying 'souvenirs' reveal the calculated cruelty of Hamas’s tactics. By World Israel News Staff In a disturbing revelation, Israeli media reported that Hamas forced three recently released hostages from Gaza—Emily Damari, Romi Gonen, and Doron Steinbrecher—to participate in a staged propaganda ceremony before their release. The hostages were handed 'gift bags' by their captors, an act that highlights the psychological manipulation employed by the terror group. The gift bags, reportedly handed to the hostages just before they were transferred to the Red Cross, included unsettling items: a photo of Gaza, photographs of the hostages during their captivity, and a so-called 'certificate of release.' According to Hebrew-language reports, these items were designed to leave a lasting psychological imprint on the survivors, embedding memories of their trauma into tangible objects. Emily Damari and Romi Gonen, held together in captivity, were allegedly coerced into posing for photos while smiling and holding their certificates. This grotesque ceremony, described as a 'farewell' by Hamas, forced the hostages to simulate gratitude toward their captors, further compounding their psychological distress. A video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) showed the hostages clutching these bags as they were handed over to Israeli troops, a chilling reminder of the torment they endured. Experts have pointed out that such staged acts serve dual purposes for Hamas. On one hand, they aim to perpetuate the group’s narrative of 'humanity' despite the underlying brutality of their actions. On the other, they act as a method of psychological warfare, ensuring that the trauma of captivity lingers long after the hostages have been freed. The staged ceremony and its accompanying 'souvenirs' reveal the calculated cruelty of Hamas’s tactics. For the survivors, these so-called gifts are not tokens of remembrance but haunting symbols of their ordeal, serving as constant reminders of the psychological and emotional scars left by their time in captivity.

Arab List MK Odeh compares hostages to convicted terrorists	MK Avigdor Liberman: 'Ayman Odeh has once again shown that he is acting as a spokesperson for Hamas in the Knesset.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News MK Ayman Odeh (Hadash-Ta'al) compared the three hostages released on Sunday to convicted terrorists freed from Israeli prisons as part of the ceasefire and hostage deal. Odeh wrote on X, 'I am relieved by the release of the hostages and prisoners. Both peoples deserve to be freed from the burden of occupation. We were all born to be free.' Yisrael Beytenu Chairman, Avigdor Liberman criticized Odeh's tweet and responded, 'Ayman Odeh has once again shown that he is acting as a spokesperson for Hamas in the Knesset. Anyone who equates our hostages with brutal terrorists should be sent to Gaza to stand with them.' On Sunday, three female hostages, Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher, and Emily Damari, were released in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners, including 69 women and 21 teenage boys. According to the agreement, in the coming weeks, a total of 33 prisoners, mainly women, men over 50, and ill hostages, will be released in exchange for 737 male and female Palestinian prisoners, many of whom have been convicted of serious crimes. In later phases of the agreement, 98 hostages will be released, both living and dead, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. This isn't the first time Odeh has compared Israeli civilians to Palestinian terrorists. In 2022, following a terrorist shooting spree that left five people dead in Bnei Brak, Odeh blamed the attack on Israel's presence in Judea and Samaria. 'Five civilians were killed today, each of them a world in its entirety. They are added to the 51 Palestinians killed since the beginning of the year, each one a world in its own right. The heart is torn in the face of the bereavement and loss of all families.' In a tweet that followed, he stated: 'I strongly oppose any harm to civilians, Palestinians or Israelis, and any harm to innocent people. It is time to end the source of hatred and that is the damned occupation, and to establish peace that will bring security and a normative life to both peoples.'

A deal that keeps Hamas in power is meaningless	Those who think that the Iran-backed Palestinian terrorist group Hamas will abandon its Jihad to murder more Jews and destroy Israel in the aftermath of the recent ceasefire-hostage agreement are mistaken. By Khaled Abu Toameh, Gatestone Institute The ceasefire-hostage deal does not require Hamas to disarm or cede control over the Gaza Strip. The terrorist group seems to be convinced that the deal will enable it to keep control of the Gaza Strip and prepare for more massacres of Jews. Shortly after the ceasefire-hostage deal was announced on January 15, Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya made it clear that his group intends to pursue its Jihad against Israel. The new US administration, to avoid more violence and bloodshed, must insist that Hamas be removed from power. This can only be accomplished by applying pressure and sanctions on Hamas's Qatari and Iranian sponsors. Those who think that the Iran-backed Palestinian terrorist group Hamas will abandon its Jihad (holy war) to murder more Jews and destroy Israel in the aftermath of the recent ceasefire-hostage agreement are mistaken. Although the agreement may put an end to the current conflict between Israel and Hamas, it does not, in any way, reflect a shift in the radical and dangerous ideology of the Islamist group, as outlined in its 1988 Covenant. The document quotes Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood organization (of which Hamas is an offshoot), as saying: 'Israel will arise and continue to exist until Islam abolishes it, as it abolished what went before.' The main points of the Hamas Covenant state: The Palestinian issue is a religious-political Muslim problem, and the conflict with Israel is between Muslims and the Jewish 'infidels.' All Palestine is Muslim land and no one has the right to give it up. An uncompromising Jihad must be waged against Israel, and any agreement recognizing its right to exist must be totally opposed. The ceasefire-hostage deal does not require Hamas to disarm or cede control over the Gaza Strip. As far as Hamas is concerned, this is just another deal similar to ceasefire agreements reached with Israel after previous rounds of fighting over the past 20 years. The terrorist group seems to be convinced that the deal will enable it to keep control of the Gaza Strip and prepare for more massacres of Jews. Shortly after the ceasefire-hostage deal was announced on January 15, Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya made it clear that his group intends to pursue its Jihad against Israel. Referring to the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, resulting in the murder of 1,200 Israelis and the wounding of thousands, al-Hayya said: 'The al-Aqsa Flood [the name Hamas uses to describe the October 7 atrocities] constitutes a significant turning point in the history of the Palestinian cause the resistance, and its repercussions won't stop until the liberation of occupied Jerusalem.' He went on to hail the October 7 massacres as 'a military and security achievement that will remain a source of pride for the Palestinian people,' and praised Iran for supporting the Palestinian 'resistance' and firing missiles at Israel during the war. In response to the ceasefire-hostage agreement, a Hamas statement said: 'This is an achievement for our people, our resistance, our nation, and the free people of the world. It is a turning point in the conflict with the [Israeli] enemy, on the path to achieving our people's goals of liberation and return.' 'Liberation' refers to Hamas's declared goal of eliminating Israel and replacing it with an Islamist state. 'Return' refers to the Palestinian demand to flood Israel with millions of 'refugees' so that Jews would become a minority in their own homeland. In yet another sign of Hamas's intention to continue the fight against Israel, supporters of the terrorist group took to the streets of the city of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip to celebrate the ceasefire-hostage deal and chanted: 'We will go to Jerusalem, we will sacrifice millions of martyrs!' Members of Hamas's military wing, Izz a-Din al-Qassam Brigades, also joined the celebration and declared: 'We are on the battlefield and we will remain on the battlefield.' The celebrations spread to the West Bank, where Hamas supporters in Ramallah, the de facto capital of the Palestinian Authority, chanted slogans in support of slain Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, the masterminds of the October 7 carnage. Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a former resident of the Gaza Strip and Senior Fellow with the Atlantic Council, wrote on January 14: 'The reality is that the Islamist terrorism of Hamas, masquerading as 'resistance,' has achieved nothing for the Palestinian people except for billions of dollars in wasted resources and tens of thousands of needless deaths, with Gaza in ruins after 20 years following the [Israeli] withdrawal of settlements [from the Gaza Strip] in 2005. Indeed, there will be a reckoning with Hamas after the war is over, and the group must be put on metaphoric, intellectual, and literal trials for its crimes against the Palestinian people's aspirations and national project&#8230;. 'Hamas's propaganda machine, run by Qatari-state media, Aljazeera Arabic, will work overtime to help the terror group turn a catastrophic disaster into a victory akin to the battles of Stalingrad and Leningrad, desperately seeking to promote terrorism and the armed resistance narrative as one that is heroic and valiant when it is cowardly, [and] ineffective&#8230;' A ceasefire-hostage deal that allows Hamas to remain in power means that it is only a matter of time before the terrorist groups attempts to launch another October 7-style attack on Israel. The new US administration, to avoid more violence and bloodshed, must insist that Hamas be removed from power. This can only be accomplished by applying pressure and sanctions on Hamas's Qatari and Iranian sponsors. Hamas must be totally defeated and eliminated, not rewarded for committing the biggest crime against Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas's defiant statements after the ceasefire-hostage agreement was reached, demonstrate the terrorist group's resolve to carry on attacking Israel. The statements also show that Hamas's leadership is willing to sacrifice more of its people to fulfill its objective of destroying Israel. Clearly, it has not learned any lesson from bringing disaster upon the Palestinians. Hamas leaders do not care if tens of thousands of Palestinians are killed as part of its Jihad against Israel. Furthermore, Hamas leaders apparently are not interested in rebuilding the Gaza Strip and providing its residents with safety, stability and prosperity. Rather, their primary goal, evidently, is still to murder as many Jews as possible. The only deal that will actually bring peace is a ceasefire where Hamas ceases to exist.

Female prison guards demand Palestinian prisoner who raped them b...	Terrorist Mahmoud Atallah, who is scheduled to be released in exchange for Israeli hostages sexually assaulted the Gilboa prison guards. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Female guards at Gilboa Prison appealed to the Supreme Court that a prisoner who raped them be released abroad and not within Israel. Terrorist Mahmoud Atallah, who is scheduled to be released in exchange for Israeli hostages, was convicted of serious crimes, including the sexual assault of the Gilboa prison guards. In their appeal, the guards said that the decision to release Atallah within Israel did not take into account the fact that he was a danger to others as well as to the guards themselves. The female guards said that if Atallah is released to Shechem as planned, he may be a danger to them, since he has threatened them directly and told them he has their personal information. The guards urged the court to approve an arrangement that would preserve their safety and not endanger the hostage release deal by sending Atallah abroad. 'The defense echelon has once again failed to protect the safety of female prison guards—this time, however, it is also permitting their blood to be shed,' said the guards' attorneys. 'Exiling the terrorist to Shechem poses a direct and immediate threat to the safety of the female guards. It appears those within the defense echelon view abandoning female guards—essentially IDF soldiers—as an acceptable course of action. We urge the Supreme Court to intervene and insist that the terrorist be sent abroad, in order to ensure the safety of the guards' lives.' A number of the 735 Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for 33 hostages in the first phase of the agreement have committed deadly crimes killing hundreds of Israelis. The following are some terrorists slated for release. Zakariya Zubeidi, the commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades of Fatah in Jenin, played a central role in orchestrating several terrorist attacks during the Second Intifada. He is responsible for the 2002 Likud branch attack in Beit She'anShe'an, which resulted in the deaths of six people. Zubeidi was also among the prisoners who escaped from Gilboa Prison in September 2021.

Netanyahu’s government shuffles positions as Otzmah Yehudit party...	An insider said Ben Gvir's party's departure is likely to spark a 'big internal fight' within Netanyahu's government and his Likud party over available positions. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News When the Otzma Yehudit Party, headed by National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, resigned on Sunday over its opposition to the hostage release deal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government prepared for a reshuffle. An insider said Ben Gvir's party's departure is likely to spark a 'big internal fight' within Netanyahu's government and his Likud party over available positions. Otzma Yehudit occupied three government ministries: the National Security Ministry, led by Ben Gvir; the Negev and Galilee Ministry, headed by Yitzhak Wasserlauf; and the Heritage Ministry, led by Amichai Eliyahu. These three ministers are scheduled to vacate their positions by Tuesday, giving Netanyahu little time to fill the roles. An insider indicates that Netanyahu is likely to appoint someone from his own party as National Security Minister, opening the door for Ben Gvir to return to the government if he wishes. One source indicated that Avi Dichter is likely to replace Ben Gvir as minister in charge of the police. Avi Dichter, a veteran of the elite commando unit Sayeret Matkal and former head of Shin Bet, assumed the role previously when it was known as the public security ministry. However, an Israel HaYom report indicated that Dichter may not be interested in the role. The newspaper posited that Eli Cohen may be chosen for the role despite allegations improperly issuing diplomatic passports. Regional Cooperation Minister David Amsalem may be considered for the Negev and Galilee Ministry. The Heritage Ministry, given its small size, may be absorbed into another ministry. In 2023, the Finance Ministry declared that the Heritage Ministry and the Negev and Galilee Ministry were superfluous and considered shelving them. 'Additional committee chair rotations are being planned. I anticipate a full reshuffle within Likud—deputy speakers, junior committee chairs, and possibly a promotion or two to minister,' the source explained. 'There are a lot of different options being considered, and the situation is shifting constantly,' the source added.

‘We’re on high alert’: Israel reinforces security after releasing...	The Israel Defense Forces said it was increasing patrols and checkpoints. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Following the release of three Israeli hostages from 471 days of captivity, Israel released 90 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists on Sunday, prompting the army to reinforce its forces in Judea and Samaria on Sunday. 'We’re on high alert,' a reserve soldier stationed near Hebron told The Press Service of Israel. The reservist said he was originally scheduled to go home for a few days off, but had to stay due to the lockdown. 'We need all available resources right now to deal with the threat, especially considering the volatile situation,' he explained. The Israel Defense Forces said it was increasing patrols and checkpoints. Members of 'The Watchers – Forum of the Wives of the Enlisted' said they were concerned over the implications of the ceasefire, pointing to ongoing violence in Shechem (Nablus), and Jenin, where the Palestinian Authority was recently in the midst of its own crackdown on terror groups. According to Moriya Michaeli, a representative of the forum, the threat of terrorism continues to grow as terror cells receive weapons from Iran smuggled through Jordan. 'This isn’t just a threat to the residents of Judea and Samaria, but to the entire population of Israel, from Ben Gurion Airport to the northern Golan Heights and beyond,' Michaeli told TPS-IL. 'The only solution to halting this escalating threat is a full-scale military operation aimed at dismantling the terror infrastructures in these areas. The situation in Judea and Samaria should be seen as an existential threat to the state of Israel, requiring an immediate and decisive response.' Protesters gathered outside the Ofer Prison, from where the Red Cross transported the freed terrorists to release points around Judea, Samaria and eastern Jerusalem. The demonstrators referred to comments by Ronen Bar, head of the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet), who told government ministers on Friday that 82% of the 1,027 prisoners released in the 2011 Gilad Shalit exchange returned to terror. Yaakov Uri, a resident of Karnei Shomron in Samaria shared his unease. 'The deal threatens the security of many Israeli citizens. Over half of the hostages are not being released in this deal, so it also seems flawed and risky. But we have no fear of terrorists returning to the region; it would not deter us from continuing to defend our homes,' he told TPS-IL. The first phase of the ceasefire will see 33 Israeli hostages freed over several weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how many of the 33 hostages are alive. Israel’s High Court of Justice rejected a legal petition against the release of the Palestinians on Sunday morning. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 94 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead.

A flawed ceasefire, but a chance to stop Iran	The Israeli government believes that removing the distraction in Gaza could be necessary to address the more dangerous threat lurking to the east. By Gregg Roman, Middle East Forum Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas is a bad deal. Jerusalem has agreed to an uneven exchange, freeing thousands of convicted terrorists in return for fewer than a hundred hostages. Some of the released prisoners will revert to violence. Yet a silver lining may outweigh immediate dangers. If the incoming Trump administration remains committed to halting Iran’s nuclear ambitions, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may conclude that acquiescing to Team Trump on Gaza might shift focus from Gaza to Tehran. With its proxies in retreat, Tehran is isolated, its path to the Mediterranean blocked. Israeli strategists argue that a resolution with Hamas, even if unfavorable on its face, allows Jerusalem to redirect military resources toward countering the Iranian nuclear program. Military planners point to secret sites like Fordow that require specialized ordnance to destroy. Only the United States can provide these munitions. Netanyahu has placed his trust in the incoming White House team, which has said repeatedly that it would not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. Secretary of State-designee Marco Rubio has defended Israel’s security requirements and called Iran the world’s leading state sponsor of terror. Pete Hegseth, who if confirmed will head the Defense Department, has said Israel should receive support to crush hostile forces and insists that Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iranian proxies have no rightful place in any government. Incoming National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has argued that the United States must seize the moment caused by the Hezbollah and Syria. Netanyahu’s critics see the hostage swap as capitulation. Many Israelis recall past deals in which freed terrorists perpetrated new attacks. Proponents of the ceasefire accept these risks but claim that ending the war spares Israel from becoming mired in a multi-front conflict. They argue that Hamas’s infrastructure is ravaged, and this pause not only frees hostages, but also enables Jerusalem to address its strategic priority: preventing a nuclear-armed Iran. While Tehran denies intending to build warheads, it enriches uranium to levels and in quantities that have few other purposes beyond weaponization. The International Atomic Energy Agency reports that Iran has enough material to make multiple bombs. The Trump administration’s appointees speak openly of stopping Iran’s program, whether diplomatically or, if necessary, by force. They also assert that a weakened Iranian regime can topple if placed under significant economic and political strain. The potential repercussions from the swift release of hostages may be painful for Israel. Still, Netanyahu believes any damage will be overshadowed if the Iranian regime is denied a nuclear bomb and the region is freed from Tehran’s grip. If the United States shares technology, intelligence, and diplomatic backing for a strike on underground Iranian sites, the price of acquiescing to President-elect Donald Trump’s push for a ceasefire may be worth it. The collapse of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Damascus showed how quickly a long-standing authoritarian state can implode if it loses foreign sponsors and domestic legitimacy. The same could be true for Iran. This effort carries risks. An open conflict with Iran could draw in multiple actors and bring retaliatory strikes on American or Israeli targets. Yet if Washington and Jerusalem do not act, Tehran soon may cross the nuclear threshold and reassert its influence in the region. The Israeli government believes that removing the distraction in Gaza could be necessary to address the more dangerous threat lurking to the east. If Tehran’s nuclear drive can be halted and its rulers deposed, the prisoner exchange with Hamas might be remembered as a short-term sacrifice that opened the door to lasting regional change.

‘The spectrum of feelings is almost paralyzing’: Israelis react a...	The hostages’ recovery from their ordeal will be lengthy, but for 'the waiting families, to know that the hostages are in their loving arms, it’s a wonderful feeling,' said a Tel Aviv resident. By Crystal Jones, TPS As Israelis welcomed the return of the first three hostages from Gaza on Sunday, individuals across the country shared feelings ranging from joy to anger and horror at the terms of the ceasefire deal with The Press Service of Israel. Doron Steinbrecher, Romi Gonen and Emily Damari were reunited with their families in Israel after 471 days in captivity. Shortly after their arrival, 90 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists were released from the Ofer Prison north of Jerusalem. Adele, a resident of Kibbutz Nirim, one of the Gaza border areas devastated by terrorists on October 7, described new-found fear. 'My feelings about the whole situation now is complex,' said the 70-year-old. 'On the one hand we are releasing convicts, convicted terrorists, to freedom. These are people with radical philosophy and blood on their hands. As someone who lives on the border, I also know that the fact that the Hamas are ending this war feeling emboldened, knowing that they can demand whatever they want from Israel, is a very frightening situation.' She went on to add, 'On the other hand, well they are still left standing, I understand that they have paid a very high price, lost their leaders, and Hezbollah has also been hit hard, Syria is a mess and Israel has shown her massive strength.' Shay Dickman also had mixed feelings. Her cousin, Carmel Gat, was one of six Israeli bodies recovered from a tunnel in Rafah in September. She told TPS-IL she was feeling 'great anticipation, great excitement,' then went on to express 'great anxiety, hoping nothing falls through, that nothing goes wrong.' Said Dickman, 'I know what it’s like to lose, the disappointment of a deal that doesn’t happen, of a deal that’s cut short. This shouldn’t happen to another family.' But at Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square, local resident Danny Shek told TPS-IL, 'These are the first [pieces of] good news in many, many months. On the one hand, when looking at the continuation of this process, there are still many tears to cry. But there’s excitement tonight, enormous excitement. These are three [people] who have been part of our lives virtually, for so, so long.' He said the hostages’ recovery from their ordeal will be lengthy, but for 'the waiting families, to know that the hostages are in their loving arms, it’s a wonderful feeling.' Lior Dodi, a 27-year-old from Jerusalem told TPS-IL the ceasefire was a setback for Israel’s war against terror. 'It’s a bad deal, It’s a deal that has to happen, it’s a deal that takes us back 20 years, and there’s nothing to do, they have to come home and we will win afterward,' he said. 'I’m feeling bad about it, I have a lot of friends who died in this war and in 2014,' Dodi added, referring to a seven-week war in Gaza that followed Hamas’s kidnap and murder of three teenagers in Gush Etzion. Another Israeli, Tali Stern, a 41-year-old mother from central Israel, told TPS-IL, 'I have not felt this emotionally drained or on edge since the beginning of the war.' She elaborated, 'I am furious at who we are giving back to these monsters and I think that in the long run this will have disastrous repercussions for our nation and I am waiting with my breath stuck in my throat to see our hostages returned. I am afraid to learn who is no longer alive, and I am afraid to see the physical consequences of more than a year being held by terrorists in horrific conditions.' She added, 'The spectrum of feelings is almost paralyzing and I have been mostly unable to accomplish anything today.' Shoshana Woznica, a 41-year-old resident from Ramat Beit Shemesh told TPS-IL, 'Obviously we all feel strongly that we want the hostages home and safe. We cry and pray for them like they are our own, but putting the rest of the country at risk by releasing dangerous criminals seems extremely wrong and foolhardy. The decision is being driven by strong emotions without logic.' Woznica argued, 'We have made kidnapping extremely worthwhile for them.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 94 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead.

Trump’s inauguration will be first attended by foreign leaders	Here is a look at the foreign leaders who are coming to Washington for the 60th inauguration. By The Associated Press For the first time in U.S. history, a president-elect will welcome foreign leaders for one of the most American political traditions — the peaceful transfer of power. President-elect Donald Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and conservative world leaders such as Argentine President Javier Milei and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni to the inauguration. Xi is sending his vice president as his representative. No heads of state have previously made an official visit to the U.S. for the inauguration. Some of them, such as Milei and Paraguay's President Santiago Peña, were special guests at the Hispanic inaugural ball Saturday night, where several of Trump’s nominees for key Cabinet positions made appearances. That included U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, chosen to lead the State Department, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tapped to head the Health and Human Services Department. Here is a look at the foreign leaders who are coming to Washington for the 60th inauguration: China Chinese President Xi Jinping was the first foreign leader whose invitation to the inauguration became public in December. Xi will not attend but is sending Vice President Han Zheng. The announcement to dispatch Han was made Friday by the country's foreign ministry, and it comes as the rivalry between the U.S. and China may escalate under Trump. Several of Trump’s Cabinet picks are known China hawks, including Rubio, who has called China 'the most potent, dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.' Trump has vowed to impose tariffs and other measures on China. But the two leaders spoke on the phone on Friday and discussed trade, fentanyl and TikTok. Trump said the call was a 'very good one.' Argentina Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after the Nov. 5 election, traveling from Buenos Aires to the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago club. Milei was scheduled to attend three inaugural galas over the weekend and one of the official inaugural balls that Trump will attend on Inauguration Day, as well as the swearing-in ceremony. Argentina's leader describes himself as an 'anarcho-capitalist.' He receives praise frequently from billionaire Elon Musk, who has grown closer to Trump since the election, for implementing a series of austerity measures that laid off tens of thousands of government workers, froze public infrastructure projects and imposed wage and pension freezes below inflation. Musk will lead a non-governmental effort to cut federal government spending, regulations and personnel. Milei hopes good relations with the U.S. could help Argentina reach a new deal with the International Monetary Fund. Italy Meloni is another leader who has recently visited Mar-a-Lago. Her weekly agenda says she will attend the swearing-in ceremony. Meloni kept unexpectedly good relations with Democratic President Joe Biden but is likely to form a more natural alliance with Trump. She is considered a key interlocutor between Europe and the U.S. Georgia Pro-Western former Georgia President Salome Zourabichvili will attend the ceremony as a guest of U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C. Georgia has been wracked by protests following a parliamentary election that opposition groups alleged was rigged. She has maintained she is still the legitimate leader of the former Soviet republic after Mikheil Kavelashvili was inaugurated as president late last month from a party that critics have accused of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. Kavelashvili's ruling party has denied those accusations. Zourabichvili told Fox News that Georgia could be 'the big success for America or the big problem for America' in the region because 'Russia is always trying to dominate.' France French President Emmanuel Macron, who met with Trump last month in Paris during the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening, won’t be at Trump’s inauguration. But figures from the country have said they are traveling for the inauguration. Eric Zemmour, a talk show pundit turned conservative politician, and his partner, Sarah Knafo, a member of the European Parliament, said they will attend. Prominent politician Marion Maréchal said in a statement that she would go as well. She is a member of the European Parliament and niece of the leading conservative figure in France eyeing the 2027 presidential election. Who else? The offices of Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and Paraguayan President Santiago Peña have said they were invited to the inauguration and planned to attend. Taiwan sent legislative speaker Han Kuo-yu and seven others to Washington for Trump’s inauguration, but Taiwan’s foreign ministry said its delegates would not attend the ceremony now that it has been moved indoors because of cold weather. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency, citing Taiwan’s foreign ministry, also reported that the delegates would meet American politicians and think tank scholars to cement Taiwan-U.S. relations. It’s unclear if they will meet Trump. Trump has criticized Taiwan for pulling some of the semiconductor industry from the U.S., but U.S.-Taiwan relations also significantly improved during his first term. On a phone call Friday between Trump and Xi, the Chinese president urged the incoming U.S. leader to approach the Taiwan issue 'with prudence' because it is about China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Beijing claims the self-governed island as Chinese territory and vows to annex it by force if necessary.

On last day in office, Biden takes credit for Israeli military vi...	The Middle East has been fundamentally transformed,' Biden says on eve of Trump's inauguration, touting Israeli victories against Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, and taking victory lap over implementation of Gaza ceasefire. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden hailed the implementation Sunday of the much-anticipated ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. Speaking shortly after the release of three Israeli women held captive by Hamas and their return to Israel, Biden gave a televised address marking his final day in office, touting Israeli military victories for having helped to reshape the Middle East. Biden noted that the hostage deal was based on the three-phase formula he had first presented last May, and celebrated the release of the first three hostages under the agreement. 'The deal that I first put forward last May for the Middle East has finally come to fruition. The ceasefire has gone into effect in Gaza, and today we’re seeing hostages be released.' 'Three Israeli women, held against their will in dark tunnels for 470 days, and four more women will be released in seven days, and additional hostages every seven days thereafter, including at least two American hostages in this initial phase.' The president expressed optimism that the ceasefire would continue into its second phase, with talks for a permanent end to the war. 'By the 16th day of the deal, talks will begin for the second phase. This phase includes the release of Israeli soldiers and a permanent end to the war, without Hamas in power or able to threaten Israel.' 'Hundreds of trucks are entering Gaza as I speak. They’re carrying assistance for civilians who suffered enormously from the war,' Biden continued. 'Today alone, we anticipate several hundred trucks will enter the Gaza Strip…and after so much pain and destruction and loss of life, today, the guns in Gaza have gone silent. This was the deal that I outlined for the world on May 31st.' 'I developed it in coordination with Egypt, Qatar, and Israel. I’ve worked for foreign policy in decades, and this was one of the toughest negotiations that I’ve been part of.' Biden credited Israel's military pressure on Hamas and the killing of senior Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, for the successful negotiations in Doha, Qatar, and linked other major defeats for Iran and its proxies in the region to Israeli military accomplishments. 'The road has been not easy and all and a long road. But we’ve reached the point today because of the pressure Israel built on Hamas, backed by the United States.' The Middle East, Biden continued, has been 'fundamentally transformed,' with the collapse of Hezbollah's influence in Lebanon, the ouster of the Assad regime in Syria, and a major weakening of Iran. 'Now the region has been fundamentally transformed. Hamas’ long-time leader Sinwar is dead. Hamas’ sponsors in the Middle East have been badly weakened by Israel, backed by the United States. Hezbollah, one of Hamas’ biggest backers, was significantly weakened on the battlefield and its leadership destroyed.' 'Even as we worked for diplomatic solutions in Lebanon, we provided ongoing assistance to support Israel’s military campaign against Hezbollah.' 'Israel’s campaign was extremely successful, so much so that by the end of November the United States had brokered a ceasefire in Lebanon. Hezbollah did what it had said it would never do…it cut a deal and abandoned Hamas.' 'In Lebanon there is finally a new president and prime minister, both of whom support a sovereign Lebanon without Hezbollah…running the show.' 'The Assad regime next door in Syria is gone.' 'Iran is in the weakest position in decades, after the U.S. military helped to defend Israel from Iranian missiles and supported Israel’s military response inside of Iran.'

Hamas will never rule Gaza, vows US national security advisor des...	If Hamas violates the deal, the United States will not interfere with Israeli moves to punish Hamas, Waltz indicated. By JNS Hamas will 'never govern Gaza,' President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said on Sunday, ahead of the U.S.-mediated ceasefire between the terrorist group and Israel. 'That is completely unacceptable,' Waltz said during an interview with CBS about the prospect of a Hamas-run Gaza. On Oct. 7, 2023, about 6,000 Hamas-led terrorists invaded Israel, murdered some 1,200 people and abducted another 251. Israel launched a campaign whose stated goal was to dismantle Hamas and retrieve the hostages. Earlier this month, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire whose first phase features the release of 33 out of 97 hostages still in Gaza in return for more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners; an Israeli redeployment in the Gaza Strip and a 42-day ceasefire. The remaining hostages are to be released in following phases whose details are yet to be negotiated. If Hamas violates the deal, the United States will not interfere with Israeli moves to punish Hamas, Waltz indicated. 'I want the Israeli people to hear me loud and clear. If Hamas reneges on this deal and Hamas backs out, moves the goalpost, what have you, we will support Israel in doing what it has to do,' he said. Waltz was optimistic when asked about the Trump administration’s chances of brokering a normalization deal between Jerusalem and Riyadh as part of the Abraham Accords. 'I do think we can expand it, and that will be between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which will be tremendous,' Waltz said.

Israeli firefighters welcomed to Los Angeles	The fires so far have burned a total of 40,697 acres, caused 27 fatalities, and destroyed 12,845 structures. By JNS U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) on Saturday welcomed an Israeli firefighting team that had arrived in Los Angeles to help battle the fires that have ravaged the city. 'Great to welcome brave Israeli firefighters to L.A. who have joined the effort to contain the #LosAngelesFires #Israel is not just sending firefighters but absorbing all costs to do so,' he tweeted. Israel’s Fire and Rescue Authority sent a team of five fire protection experts to California on Wednesday in an effort to assist firefighters battling the wildfires still blazing in Los Angeles. The delegation, which will remain in the United States for about a week, includes members who specialize in forest fire prevention, with experience gained from major blazes in Israel in past years. According to the the latest numbers provided by the CalFire website, the Pacific Palisades fire is 49% contained and the Eaton Fire, affecting Pasadena and Altadena, is 73% contained. The fires so far have burned a total of 40,697 acres, caused 27 fatalities and destroyed 12,845 structures. Both Southern California and Israel share similar climates, with hot and dry summer seasons and only limited rain in the winter months. This, coupled with strong winds, contributes to the outbreak of wildfires.

Three Israeli hostages handed over to Red Cross	Three Israeli women said to be in 'good' condition after 471 days in captivity ni the Gaza Strip. By JNS and World Israel News Staff The International Committee of the Red Cross has informed the Israel Defense Forces that the three Israeli hostages slated for release from Hamas captivity in Gaza have been handed over, the military said. 'According to information received from the Red Cross, three Israeli hostages were transferred to the Red Cross and they are on their way toward IDF and Israel Security Agency forces in Gaza,' the army stated. An Israeli official said the three were assessed as being in 'good' condition, Arutz Sheva reported. Footage broadcast on Israeli television appeared to show them alive, surrounded by armed Hamas terrorists in Gaza City’s Saraya Square. Israel’s Channel 12 News had cited the Palestinian Islamist organization as declaring that it would 'soon' hand over the captives, who were taken by terrorists during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist massacre and were held hostage in the Gaza Strip for 471 days. The Red Cross was expected to hand over the captives to Israeli special forces inside the Netzarim Corridor that splits the northern and southern Strip. Once that happens, it will be another approximately two hours until they arrive at the hospital in Israel, the army estimates. The mothers of the three hostages will first meet them at the reception complex near Kibbutz Re’im. The remaining family members will meet them at the hospital. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz arrived at the reception point near the border community of Kibbutz Re’im, his office said. 'I came here to make sure that the IDF is prepared to receive and escort the hostages who are returning to Israel today. We will not stop the war until all the hostages return home,' Katz said in the published remarks. The Israel Defense Forces shared footage on Sunday afternoon of the initial reception point, from where the released hostages are expected to be taken to hospitals, where they will be reunited with their families. After Hamas delivered to Jerusalem the names of the three female hostages set to be released, the ceasefire took effect at 11:15 a.m. Under the agreement with Hamas, the terrorist group should have provided the names of the hostages at least 24 hours ahead of the release of the three captives expected to be freed on Sunday at 4 p.m. Gonen, 24, was abducted from the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re’im after being shot by Hamas terrorists on the morning of Oct. 7, 2023, while Steinbrecher, 31, and Damari, 28, were taken from their homes in the border community of Kfar Aza. Steinbrecher is a dual Israeli-Romanian citizen, while Damari also holds British citizenship. Israel’s Health Ministry has formulated a new protocol for receiving and treating the captives due to be released, based on lessons learned from the November 2023 exchange of hostages for Palestinian terrorists. The protocol has detailed guidelines for medical examinations, mental health care, privacy protection and long-term support for returnees and their families, emphasizing personalized care and respect for dignity. Israel estimates that 25 of the 33 people on the list of hostages to be returned in the first stage of the renewed ceasefire deal are still alive. Ninety-four hostages abducted during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led massacre are still being held in Gaza, at least one-third of them dead. The 33 captives are considered 'humanitarian' cases—women, children, men over 50, wounded and ill, including two mentally ill Israelis who entered the Strip on their own over a decade ago (Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed).

Itamar Ben-Gvir and his Otzma Yehudit party quit Netanyahu govern...	Protesting the Gaza ceasefire and the release of hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and his Otzma Yehudit party bolt Netanyahu's government. By World Israel News Staff Israel's National Security Minister resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government Sunday, in protest of the Gaza ceasefire deal, which was approved by the cabinet Friday evening. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, chairman of the Otzma Yehudit party, submitted his letter of resignation Sunday morning, after the cabinet voted 24 to 8 in favor of the hostage and ceasefire deal with Hamas that would see the release of several thousand jailed Palestinian terrorists, including hundreds of convicted murderers, in exchange for the freeing of 97 Israeli captives, roughly half of whom are believed to be dead. The entire Otzma Yehudit party followed suit Sunday, with Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu and Minister for the Development of the Periphery, the Negev, and the Galilee Yitzhak Wasserlauf submitting their own letters of resignation from the government. Three Otzma MKs, Zvika Fogel, Limor Son Har-Melech, and Yitzhak Kreuzer, submitted their resignations from Knesset committee, in keeping with the party’s departure from the coalition. In a statement Sunday, the party castigated Prime Minister Netanyahu and the government for the 'approval of the reckless agreement with the terrorist organization Hamas, the release of hundreds of murderers who shed the blood of men, women and children - who are also being released to Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria, while renouncing the IDF's achievements in the war, the withdrawal of IDF forces from the Gaza Strip and the cessation of fighting in Gaza, in an agreement that constitutes a surrender to Hamas.' In his resignation letter, Ben-Gvir castigated the hostage deal, calling it a 'dangerous agreement,' which 'unfortunately constitutes a surrender to terrorism, crossing every ideological red line, and is in total contradiction with everything you laid out in the past.'

Trump’s hostage deal ultimatum was also aimed at Israel – report	The incoming president reportedly messaged Netanyahu that he 'has been a great friend of Israel and now it’s time to be a friend back.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News When incoming president Donald Trump warned that there would be 'hell to pay' if a hostage deal was not signed before he came into office, the message was seemingly directed just as much at Israel as Hamas, according to a Wall Street Journal report Saturday. Special Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last Saturday when he met with him that Trump had said in no uncertain terms, 'Make the deal.' 'The president has been a great friend of Israel and now it’s time to be a friend back,' Witkoff said to Netanyahu, according to the paper’s source. He also told the prime minister that the Israeli negotiators in Qatar needed the power to make decisions on their own and 'If Netanyahu didn’t want to work that way, everyone should just pack their bags and go home.' Just days later, the negotiating team, headed by Mossad chief David Barnea, returned with an agreement that was then authorized by the Cabinet on Friday night. The U.S. has many more sticks it can use against Israel than it does against Hamas, especially as Trump has made it clear that he would not involve the U.S. military in any conflict in the world right now. This can include the threats of withholding weapons as the Biden administration did in part, and declining to back Israel in international bodies such as the UN and International Criminal Court. There is always the possibility that support for a decisive Israeli strike on Iran, the master puppeteer and funder of all the terrorist organizations acting against the Jewish state, could be put on the line as well. While according to surveys, a majority of Israelis support the deal, a solid minority do not, including families of soldiers killed in the war and some families of the hostages themselves, who protested in Jerusalem Saturday night insisting that the long-term security of the state is in danger if the government carries through with the terms, and that this is more important than the fate of their loved ones. In the first phase of the ceasefire, set to last six weeks, 33 hostages – not all of them alive – are to be freed by Hamas in dribs and drabs of three each week, including women, children, men over age 50 and those injured or ill. Fully 14 of the hostages are going to be released only in the very last week, including Avraham Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, two mentally incapacitated Israelis who have been held in Gaza since 2014 and 2015, respectively, after they wandered into the Strip on their own. For its part, Israel will release up to 737 Palestinian security prisoners, including 290 who are serving multiple life sentences, and 1,167 Gazans who had been captured in the 15-month long war but were not part of the Hamas-led invasion force that massacred 1,200 people and abducted over 250 last October, 97 of whom are still in captivity, with perhaps half of them still alive. Since the 'price' for each live hostage returned is higher than the one for those who are dead, the number of prisoners may go down. Hamas has only committed to telling Israel 24 hours ahead of time which three hostages it is releasing in any of the five first weeks. For each live civilian female or child abductee, 30 security prisoners who are female or under age 19 will be released. Female IDF soldiers will exact a higher price, 50 security prisoners for each one. Every live abductee over age 50 returned will garner 30 terrorists who are sick or over the same age. For the nine sick or injured hostages who are not soldiers, 110 security prisoners will be released. The IDF will also withdraw from all population centers to kilometer-wide border zones within the Strip and allow the mass return of Gazans to their homes from the humanitarian safe areas in the southern part of the coastal enclave. Negotiations for the release of the rest of the hostages in phase two will begin in the middle of phase one. Netanyahu tried to spin the Cabinet’s authorization as one for a 'temporary' lull in the effort to destroy Hamas, saying that Trump had agreed that if Israel’s security demands aren’t met in the second phase, the IDF can 'return to the war.' However, in an interview with NBC, Trump said that the ceasefire 'better hold.'

3 of the top 5 NCAA men’s basketball teams are coached by Jews	March Madness should be fun for Jewish fans — and coaches — this year! By Jacob Gurvis, JTA We’re about halfway through the college basketball season, and it couldn’t be going much better for the nation’s top Jewish coaches. The Associated Press released its latest Top 25 Poll on Monday, and three of the top five men’s teams, along with one of the top five women’s teams, are coached by Jews. On the men’s side, Bruce Pearl’s Auburn is ranked No. 1, riding a nine-game winning streak to a 16-1 overall record and the top spot in the Southeastern Conference. Pearl, a former Maccabiah Games coach and the co-founder of the NCAA’s Jewish Coaches Association, is one of the more outspoken Jewish and pro-Israel coaches in all of college sports. Duke, led by coach Jon Scheyer, clocks in at No. 3 on the men’s side, with a 15-2 record and an 11-game winning streak of their own. Scheyer, who played professionally in Israel with Maccabi Tel Aviv after winning the NCAA title as a Duke player in 2010, has drawn support from the university’s Jewish student body. And at No. 5 in the men’s rankings is Florida, coached by Todd Golden. The Gators are also 15-2 and are coming off a tough one-point loss against Missouri on Tuesday. Golden is also an alum of Israel’s pro league, and he played for Pearl on the gold-medal-winning U.S. team at the 2009 Maccabiah Games. (Credit/JTA) On the women’s side, Lindsay Gottlieb’s University of Southern California ranks No. 4 on the AP’s latest list. The Trojans have won 12 straight and at 16-1 are in second place in the Big Ten, behind rival UCLA, which the AP ranked No. 1. Gottlieb, who earned her 300th career coaching win earlier this season, is a member of the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame of Northern California.

Report: Trump mulling temporarily moving some Gazans to Indonesia	Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly planning regular trips to Gaza and Israel to keep the pressure on both sides to implement the newly-signed ceasefire deal. By World Israel News Staff President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has floated a number of proposals for managing the post-war reconstruction of the Gaza Strip and ensuring full implementation of the ceasefire deal with Israel, according to a report by NBC News, including the possible temporary relocation of part of the Strip's population abroad. Citing an unnamed Trump transition official, the report claimed that the incoming president's Middle East special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is mulling regular trips to the region to ensure both sides remain in compliance with the truce. According to the report, Witkoff is even considering visiting the war-torn Gaza Strip itself. 'You have to be right on top of it, ready to snuff out a problem if it happens,' the official said of Witkoff's plans to frequent the region. The Trump transition official said the administration would need to keep a watchful eye not only on Hamas but also on right-wing Israeli 'radicals' to prevent a collapse of the ceasefire. 'Remember, there’s a lot of people, radicals, fanatics, not just from the Hamas side, from the right wing of the Israeli side, who are absolutely incentivized to blow this whole deal up.' In terms of planning the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip after the war with Israel is over, the official cited by the NBC News report said the incoming administration is considering wide-ranging proposals, including the temporarily relocation of part of Gaza's population to a third-party country. A number of possible destinations have been floated, the official said, including Indonesia. The official did not specify whether the Trump transition team has been in contact with foreign leaders, including Indonesia's, regarding the potential relocation. Nor did the official say if any effort has been made to feel-out support for such a move within the Gaza Strip.

Biden commutes 2,500 sentences, shattering single-day record days...	The outgoing president also received heavy criticism for his sweeping pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, after repeatedly promising not to do so. By The Washington Free Beacon President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of roughly 2,500 non-violent drug offenders Friday, breaking his own record for single-day commutations just days before leaving office. Those receiving clemency were 'serving disproportionately long sentences compared to the sentences they would receive today under current law, policy, and practice,' Biden said in a statement released Friday. 'This action is an important step toward righting historic wrongs, correcting sentencing disparities, and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending far too much time behind bars.' Biden had previously set the mark for single-day commutations in December, when he reduced the sentences of nearly 1,500 individuals and pardoned another 39. Biden came under fire for these grants of clemency, which included a corrupt Pennsylvania judge who sent juveniles to prison in exchange for kickbacks and a woman who murdered two husbands and an ex-boyfriend for insurance money. The outgoing president also received heavy criticism for his sweeping pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, after repeatedly promising not to do so. 'With this action, I have now issued more individual pardons and commutations than any president in U.S. history,' Biden said Friday. Biden indicated that more commutations might be on the way, saying he 'will continue to review additional commutations and pardons' prior to leaving office next week.

A closer look at the Palestinian prisoners due to be released	The final number of the terrorists to be released in the deal will depend on how many of the 33 hostages are alive. By Pesach Benson, TPS The first phase of a ceasefire agreement that goes into effect on Sunday will see 33 Israeli hostages freed in exchange for hundreds of imprisoned Palestinian terrorists. Israel released a list of 735 prisoners on Saturday to give families of their victims time to file legal petitions. Here is a look at some of the more notable figures on the list. — Mohammed Abu Warda: A Hamas member who sent suicide bombers to blow themselves up on Jerusalem busses in attacks that killed 45 people. Warda was sentenced to 48 life sentences. — Wael Qassem, Wassam Abbasi, and Mohammed Odeh: Members of a Hamas terror cell responsible for bombings that killed 35 people, including a Hebrew University cafeteria, Rishon LeZion’s Shefayim Club and a Jerusalem cafe. — Thabet Mardawi: A Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander serving 21 life terms plus 40 years for organizing suicide bombings in Hadera, Afula, Binyamina and Kiryat Motzkin, shooting attacks, and a car bombing. His attacks during the Second Intifada killed 20 people and injured around 150 more. — Omar al-Zaben: A Hamas commander serving 27 life sentences for attacks that killed 27 Israelis. — Abdullah Sharbati, Majdi Zaatari, and Samer al-Atrash: Members of a cell who masterminded a 2003 suicide bombing that killed 23 people in Jerusalem, including seven children. — Ahmad Barghouti: sentenced to 13 life terms for ordering attacks that killed 12 Israelis during the Second Intifada. Ahmad is a cousin of Marwan Barghouti, the highest profile terrorist who is expected to be deported a later stage. — Sami Jaradat: A Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander from the Jenin area involved in the 2003 bombing of a Haifa restaurant that killed 21 people. — Mohammed Naifeh: Planned attacks on Hermesh and Kibbutz Meter in which eight Israelis were killed. — Zakariya Zubeidi: A former Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades commander in Jenin, responsible for multiple terror attacks. Six people were killed when terrorists ordered by Zubeidi attacked a Likud branch building in Beit Shean with guns and grenades as party members were voting in a primary in 2002. Zubeidi was one of six Gilboa Prison escapees in 2021. — Mohammed Amoudi: Sent a suicide bomber to Tel Aviv who killed 11 people at a food stand in 2006. — Ramadan Mashahra: Was involved in the 2002 suicide bombing aboard a bus in Jerusalem that killed 19 people. — Shadi Amouri: A member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad who helped plan a 2002 car bombing that killed 17 people at the Megiddo Junction. — Ali Safuri: A senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad figure involved in multiple terror attacks which killed nine people and injured more than 100. The final number of the terrorists to be released in the deal will depend on how many of the 33 hostages are alive. The most contentious aspect of the agreement is that the fate of the remaining 65 hostages will be determined by negotiations to begin on the 16th day of the ceasefire. Critics say the phased approach condemns hostages not freed in the beginning to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 95 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead.

First three hostages to be released identified	Hamas says it will free three women on Sunday, including a dual British-Israeli citizen, a dual Romanian-Israeli citizen, and a young Israeli woman who was shot and wounded during the Supernova music festival. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization on Sunday revealed the names of the three hostages slated to be released during the first day of the ceasefire with Israel. After hours of delays, Israel announced that the ceasefire went into effect at 11:15 a.m. Sunday, after originally having been slated to begin at 8:30 a.m. The ceasefire was delayed after Hamas failed to handover a list of the first three hostages set to be released. Under the terms of last week's truce agreement, Hamas is required to notify Israel at least 24 hours in advance of the identities of the hostages set for release. With the first three hostages set to be released at 4:30 p.m. Sunday, the list was required by 4:30 p.m. Saturday afternoon. Israel repeatedly warned Saturday night and Sunday morning that it would not implement the ceasefire until the list was received. IDF artillery and warplanes struck Hamas targets across the Gaza Strip Sunday morning, after the 8:30 deadline for beginning the ceasefire. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry claimed that 13 people were killed and dozens more injured in the strikes. At 10:24 a.m., a Hamas spokesman finally published the list of hostages set to be released Sunday. The list includes Emily Damari, 28, Romi Gonen, 24, and Doron Steinbrecher, 31. Gonen was shot and wounded on the morning of October 7th while she attended the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. After she was wounded, Gonen was taken captive by Hamas terrorists and carried off into the Gaza Strip. Gonen was on the phone with her mother when she was shot. Steinbrecher and Damari are both residents of the border town of Kfar Azza. The two were seized by Hamas terrorists who overran their town and taken captive into the Gaza Strip. Damaria, a dual British-Israeli citizen, suffered multiple wounds during the terrorist attack on her home, being shot in the hand and suffering shrapnel wounds to one of her legs. Steinbrecher, who carries both Romanian and Israeli citizenship, was hiding under her bed when terrorists broke into her house and took her into captivity.

IDF bombs Hamas positions as ceasefire delayed	Israel delayed Gaza ceasefire for hours and struck multiple terror targets after Hamas refused to handover list of hostages to be released. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Implementation of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip was delayed Sunday morning, after the Hamas terror organization failed to provide a list of the three Israeli hostages slated for release later in the day. As part of the agreement signed last week, Hamas is obligated to provide Israel with the names of the hostages slated for release at least 24 hours prior to their return to Israel. While Hamas was required to identify the three by 4:30 p.m. Saturday - one full day before their scheduled return Sunday afternoon - the terror group declined to release the hostages' names by the scheduled start of the ceasefire at 8:30 a.m. Sunday. As a result, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office and the IDF announced the beginning of the ceasefire had been delayed. In the interim, IDF forces bombed and shelled Hamas positions across the Gaza Strip. According to Gaza health officials, 13 people were killed and dozens more injured in attacks on Gaza City, Beit Lahia, Khan Yunis, Beit Hanoun, and other sites across the Gaza Strip. At 10:24 a.m., Hamas finally released the names of three Israeli women slated for release Sunday afternoon. The Prime Minister's Office responded to the release of the hostage list, saying Israeli security officials were verifying the details. 'Israel has received the list of the hostages who are due to be released today according to the framework. The security establishment is now checking the details,' the GPO said. 'Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch has initially notified the hostages' families via IDF representatives.' Netanyahu's office said that following the publication of the hostage list, the ceasefire went into effect at 11:15 a.m. The post IDF bombs Hamas positions as ceasefire delayed appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/idf-bombs-hamas-positions-as-ceasefire-delayed/	2025-01-19T01:28:00-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gaza.png
Trump and top aide challenge Netanyahu’s claim ceasefire will be ...	Ceasefire deal 'better hold,' says Trump calling for an 'end' to Gaza war, as his incoming National Security Advisor vows to hostage families US will ensure all three phases of ceasefire deal will be implemented. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump and a top aide appeared to contradict claims by senior Israeli leaders over the weekend that Israel may resume its war against Hamas after the first phase of a three-part ceasefire. On Saturday, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had assured him that despite the cabinet ratifying the three-part hostage and ceasefire deal with Hamas Friday night, the IDF would resume its operations against the terror group in Gaza after the first phase of the deal. Netanyahu himself hinted at a renewal of the fighting, saying Saturday night that Israel is still committed to the destruction of Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never again threatens Israel's security. 'We retain the right to return to the war, if necessary, with the backing of the U.S.,' Netanyahu said, claiming that Trump himself had endorsed a return to fighting in Gaza during a call last week with the Israeli premier. Trump 'welcomed the agreement and rightly emphasized that the first stage of the agreement is a temporary ceasefire. That is what he said, ‘a temporary ceasefire’.' That same day, however, Trump appeared to contradict Netanyahu's claim during an interview with NBC News. Trump said that the new ceasefire 'better hold.' 'Well, we’re going to see very soon, and it better hold.' The incoming president recalled his recent telephone conversation with Netanyahu, saying that while he said Israel must do 'what has to be done,' he also emphasized that the war 'has to end.' 'Just keep doing what you have to do. You have to have — this has to end. We want it to end, but to keep doing what has to be done.' Trump said his administration would ensure the ceasefire holds, saying the maintenance of the truce would be a litmus test of American soft power abroad. 'The United States has to get respected again, and it has to get respected fast. But respect is the primary word that I use,' Trump said. 'If they respect us, it will hold. If they don’t respect us, all hell will break out.' Hours after the interview, Axios cited three sources who claimed that Trump's choice for National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, on Saturday pledged to relatives of hostages in Gaza that the Trump administration would ensure that the full three-stages of the ceasefire will be implemented. Hostage families have feared that the 64 other hostages remaining in Gaza not slated for release during the six-week initial phase will be left in the coastal enclave should Israel resume the war after phase one of the agreement. Waltz assured the families that the White House would push for talks aimed at securing the implementation of the second phase of the deal as soon as possible.

‘No surrender’ – 3 arrested in Jerusalem protests against ceasefi...	The ceasefire 'will plunge Israel into a national tragedy for decades to come,' says father of fallen soldier. By World Israel News Staff Thousands of protesters gathered in Jerusalem on Saturday evening, urging the government not to implement a ceasefire and hostage deal. Many of those participating in the protest are members of the Gvura Forum, an umbrella group advocating for the families of fallen soldiers and terror victims. Protesters held signs demanding the death penalty for terrorists and warning that freed terrorists have killed Israelis after their release. Some demonstrators dressed up as terrorists, painting their hands red to symbolize blood. Mock corpses wrapped in Jewish burial shrouds were carried by protesters, illustrating the potential murders of Israeli citizens following the mass release of terrorists. Yehoshua Shani, whose IDF soldier son was killed battling Hamas terrorists during the October 7th terror invasion, addressed the crowd. 'Hundreds of arch-terrorists will be released into the streets. We have seen in the past how this ended. Freeing hundreds of murderers and leaders of terrorist organizations during a time of war encourages terrorism, and an immediate risk to the security of Israeli citizens,' Shani said. Shani criticized the deal's framework, which see the 98 hostages freed in various phases. Many in Israel have expressed skepticism that the deal will hold for long enough to see the release of hostages included in the second and third stages. The current deal 'will leave behind dozens of new 'Ron Arads',' Shani said, referring to an Israeli pilot taken hostage in Syria in the 1980s, whose body has never been recovered. He added that the ceasefire 'will plunge Israel into a national tragedy for decades to come.' After demonstrators blocked traffic under the Chords Bridge, police worked to disperse the protest. Three demonstrators were arrested, according to a statement from the police.

Remains of IDF soldier killed in 2014 found in Gaza, returned to ...	IDF Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul was killed during fighting between Israel and Hamas in 2014, and his body was seized by terrorists and held in the Gaza Strip for over a decade. By World Israel News Staff The remains of an IDF soldier killed while fighting against Hamas terrorists in 2014 and held captive in the Gaza Strip for over a decade have been located by Israeli forces operating in the coastal enclave, the Israeli military announced Sunday morning. Oron Shaul, a 20-year-old IDF soldier, was fatally wounded after the armored personnel carrier he was riding in was struck by an anti-tank projectile fired by Hamas terrorists in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood of Gaza City. The remains of six other soldiers killed in the attack on the vehicle were later recovered by the IDF. However, terrorists pulled Shaul's remains from the wreckage of the destroyed APC and held them captive, along with the remains of another IDF soldier killed during the fighting - Hadar Goldin. On Sunday, Israeli's military and the Shin Bet internal security agency issued a joint statement announcing that Shaul's remains had been located in the Gaza Strip during a recent operation, adding that the slain soldier's body had been returned to Israel. 'Efforts to retrieve him, including the gathering of information and intelligence by the Prisoners and Missing Persons Headquarters and the Special Operations Division in Military Intelligence, have continued over the past decade, with intensified efforts during the war,' the IDF and Shin Bet said in the joint statement. 'Following an identification process conducted by the Institute of Forensic Medicine and the Military Rabbinate, IDF and Shin Bet representatives informed the family this morning.' 'The IDF and Shin Bet express their condolences to the family and will continue to support them.' Sunday's announcement did not provide details regarding where in Gaza Shaul's body was found, nor when or how the operation was conducted.

Islamic Jihad threatens to murder hostages before ceasefire start...	PIJ claims Israeli bombing is threatening the lives of hostages, hours before ceasefire is due to begin. By World Israel News Staff The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terror group threatened the lives of the Israeli hostages it is holding, saying they would be killed unless Israel stopped its military activities in Gaza Strip before the ceasefire is slated to come into effect at 8:30 a.m. on Sunday. PIJ attacked southern Israel alongside Hamas and other, smaller terror organizations on October 7th, taking a significant number of hostages. 'The people of the enemy prisoners must demand that the Zionist army stop the bombardment of the last hours, which is the reason for the killing of your children while the resistance is making the final field arrangements for their release,' PIJ spokesman Abu Hamza said in a statement released on social media platform Telegram. 'The intensity of the Zionist bombardment leads us towards two paths, the first of which is that the families of the Zionist prisoners receive their children in coffins or [safely] in their homes, and the choice of the last hours is in the hands of the Zionist army alone,' the statement concluded. While the text appeared to blame the potential deaths of hostages on IAF bombing, Hamas has murdered numerous captives, then blamed their deaths on the Israeli military. Bodies of some hostages - whom Hamas claimed were killed in airstrikes - were found to have been shot at point-blank range. Dozens of high-profile PIJ terrorists are expected to be released from Israeli prisons during the first phase of the ceasefire. Thabet Mardawi, a senior PIJ member convicted for his role in deadly terror attacks during the Second Intifada that killed 21 Israelis and wounded some 200, will be set free. High-profile attacks planned by Mardawi include a bus bombing near Jerusalem, shooting attack at Hadera's outdoor market, and a suicide bombing at Kibbutz Shluhot.

Netanyahu warns Hamas holding up ceasefire, hints Gaza war will r...	Defending controversial ceasefire plan against criticism from the Right, Prime Minister Netanyahu says hostage deal frozen until Hamas gives details of hostages' condition. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke out Saturday night in defense of his government's decision to ratify the hostage and ceasefire deal with Hamas over the weekend, raising the ire of many on the Israeli Right. In a televised address at 8:10 p.m., Netanyahu emphasized the return of Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip, while adding that his government would not compromise on the two other goals formally adopted by the cabinet following the October 7th invasion of Israel. 'It is this strength that has led us with determination to achieve all of the objectives of the war that we set: Returning all of our hostages, eliminating Hamas' military and governing capabilities and ensuring that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to our country,' Netanyahu said. 'As of today, we have returned home 157 of our hostages, 117 of whom alive. Under the agreement that has now been approved, we will return home another 33 of our brothers and sisters, most of them alive.' Despite the deal's provision for negotiations to make the truce permanent, Netanyahu said the incoming Trump administration supported limiting the ceasefire, making it 'temporary.' Trump 'welcomed the agreement and rightly emphasized that the first stage of the agreement is a temporary ceasefire. That is what he said, 'a temporary ceasefire'.' Netanyahu said that Israel had received explicit U.S. backing to resume the war in Gaza 'if necessary,' denying that the agreement commits Israel to a permanent end to the war. '. For many months, Hamas demanded that we promise in advance to end the war as a condition for its entering a framework for the release of the hostages, and it set all kinds of additional dictated terms.' 'I strongly opposed these dictated terms – and my position was accepted. We retain the right to return to the war, if necessary, with the backing of the U.S.' The agreement, set to go into effect Sunday morning at 8:30, includes a three-stage ceasefire, during which all of the 98 captives - alive and dead - still held in the Gaza Strip are to be returned to Israel. During the first stage, which will last for six weeks, 33 Israeli hostages are slated to be freed, in exchange for hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists, with 30 terrorists to be released for each Israeli civilian, and 50 for each female IDF soldier returned to Israel. The 33 hostages slated for return to Israel during the first six weeks include both living and dead captives, with Israeli officials estimating that 25 of the captives on the list are still alive while 8 others are believed to be dead, though Hamas has yet to handover information on the hostages' condition. Hamas has also failed thus far to provide a list of the three hostages who are set to be returned Sunday afternoon, despite the deal requiring 24-hour prior notification. Prior to Netanyahu's address Saturday night, the Prime Minister's Office warned Hamas that the implementation of the hostage deal cannot move forward until Israel receives the list of hostages set to be released Sunday afternoon. 'We will be unable to move forward with the framework until we receive the list of the hostages who will be released, as was agreed. Israel will not tolerate violations of the agreement. Hamas is solely responsible.' In addition, the deal provides for the massive expansion of international aid into the Gaza Strip, guaranteeing at least 600 aid trucks will enter the coastal enclave each day to deliver goods and fuel. The IDF will partially withdraw from key positions in Gaza, including the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, and allow the return en masse of Gazans to northern Gaza. While a joint team assembled by Qatar and Egypt will be assigned to use X-ray machines to check vehicles for weapons, pedestrians walking north will not be subjected to any security checks. In his Saturday night address, Netanyahu did not mention the planned withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor, but denied claims that the ceasefire deal required Israel to pullout from the Philadelphi Corridor on the Gaza-Egypt border. 'And the third principle – keeping the Philadelphi Corridor and the security buffer zone. When I say keeping the Philadelphi Corridor, not only will we not reduce our forces there, we will even increase them slightly, and this is contrary to all of the reports that I hear.' 'We promised in the agreement that Israel would keep full control in the Philadelphi Corridor and the security buffer around the entire Gaza Strip. We will not allow war materiel to be smuggled in, nor will we allow our hostages to be smuggled out.'

Supreme Court rejects petition against hostage deal and ceasefire	We call on all Israeli citizens to hug their children tightly and arm themselves,' warns NGO representing terror victims and bereaved families. By World Israel News Staff The Supreme Court rejected a petition on Sunday morning that sought an injunction to prevent the Israeli government from implementing a ceasefire and hostage deal. The justices made the decision without hearing oral arguments, solely based on written arguments submitted to the Court. The petition was filed by Choosing Life, an NGO composed of the family members of fallen soldiers and victims of terror attacks. In its ruling rejecting the petition, the Court wrote that it does not intervene on matters of national security and foreign policy. 'This is one of the cases in which the limits of the law is clear. Our hearts go out to the families of those who have not yet returned, as well as to those who see the murderers of their loved ones leave prison and their eyes are filled with tears. Alongside this, there is still hope that sons and daughters will indeed return to their homeland,' wrote Justice Dafna Barak Erez. 'The values ​​at the heart of the discussion, primarily the sanctity of life and the redemption of captives, are not in dispute; however, there is also a sharp debate regarding the implementation' of a ceasefire deal, she added. Choosing Life also requested that the family members of those murdered in terror attacks would receive an advance phone call warning them that their loved one's killers were being released from prison. The Court rejected the request, calling it 'unnecessary.' Following the ruling, Choosing Life said that the Court often intervenes on security matters, such as how prisoners are treated. 'Apparently, if we had petitioned to improve the conditions of the terrorists, the High Court would at least hold a hearing, but we are just families whose murderers of loved ones are released, so we're not important,' the NGO said in a media statement. 'We explained in the petition that the reckless decision [to release thousands of terrorists] was made, the streets will be filled with murderers, and there is no one to save them. Not the political echelon, not the security echelon, not the legal echelon. We call on all Israeli citizens to hug their children tightly and arm themselves.'

The following are some terrorists slated for release. Zakariya Zubeidi, the commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades of Fatah in Jenin, played a central role in orchestrating several terrorist attacks during the Second Intifada. He is responsible for the 2002 Likud branch attack in Beit She'an, which resulted in the deaths of six people. Zubeidi was also among the prisoners who escaped from Gilboa Prison in September 2021. Majdi Za'tari, from East Jerusalem, was sentenced to 23 life sentences and an additional 50 years in prison. He was convicted of orchestrating a suicide bombing on a bus in Jerusalem in August 2003, which resulted in the deaths of 23 people. Ahmed Barghouti, commander of the Fatah military wing in the Ramallah area, is serving 13 life sentences. He was convicted of carrying out a series of suicide attacks during the Second Intifada, which led to the deaths of 12 Israelis. Notably, his actions included the attack on the 'Seafood Market' restaurant in Tel Aviv, as well as bombings in Neve Ya'akov and Jaffa Street in Jerusalem. Thabet Mardawi, a high-ranking member of Islamic Jihad, was responsible for the deaths of 21 Israelis and the injuries of nearly 200 during the Second Intifada. He orchestrated a series of deadly attacks, including a suicide bombing at Kibbutz Shluhot, a shooting spree at a market in Hadera, an assault near Camp 80, and a bus bombing at Moza Junction.

Otzma Yehudit party to resign from Israeli government on Sunday	The move comes after Ben Gvir threatened to leave the government over the approval of the hostage release and ceasefire deal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Otzma Yehudit party, headed by National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, said it will resign from the Israeli government on Sunday. The move comes after Ben Gvir threatened to leave the government over the approval of the hostage release and ceasefire deal which he called 'reckless.' 'The approval of the agreement with the terrorist group Hamas is a reckless decision, involving the release of hundreds of individuals responsible for the deaths of countless civilians,' Otzma Yehudit wrote in a statement. 'This agreement undermines the IDF's hard-won achievements in the war, calls for the withdrawal of IDF forces from Gaza, and effectively halts the ongoing military efforts. It amounts to nothing less than surrender to Hamas,' the statement continued. The Otzma Yehudit ministers who are resigning are: Itamar Ben-Gvir, Yitzhak Wasserlauf, and Amichai Eliyahu, along with committee chairs MKs Zvika Fogel and Limor Son Har-Melech, as well as MK Yitzhak Kreuzer. 'The deal taking shape is reckless,' Ben-Gvir stated in a televised address on Thursday. He insisted that the agreement would 'erase the achievements of the war' by releasing hundreds of Palestinian terrorists and withdrawing from key areas in Gaza, ultimately leaving Hamas functional. 'This deal sends a message to Hamas that they can kidnap Israelis, attack us and in the end, they will get what they want,' he added. Two other ministers, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli, threatened to leave the government over the hostage and ceasefire deal. On Thursday, Smotrich and his party Religious Zionism indicated they would be willing to remain in the government and accept the first phase of the hostage release deal provided that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signs a statement that Israel will resume the war against Hamas immediately after. Although Smotrich and Chikli have not announced their resignation, they voted against the hostage deal on Friday. Smotrich stated that his party did 'everything possible to prevent a harmful deal that would jeopardize Israel's security.' He added, 'Unfortunately, Prime Minister Netanyahu chose to approve a disastrous and harmful deal—one that threatens Israel's national security and reverses many of the war's accomplishments.'
