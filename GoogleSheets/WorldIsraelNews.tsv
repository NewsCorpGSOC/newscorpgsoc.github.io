IDF reports it is battling newly recruited Hamas terrorists in Ga...	The source emphasized that there has been a notable decline in the quality of its forces. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As the IDF has returned to northern Gaza to battle Hamas, Israel's military admits that many of the terrorists they are fighting are new recruits. The aim of the renewed campaign in northern Gaza is to eliminate terrorist infrastructure. Galai Tzahal (IDF Radio) Military correspondent Doron Kadosh reported that many of the Hamas terrorists soldiers are fighting against have been recruited since the war. Officers said the goal of the current operation is to destroy Hamas's infrastructure to make additional missions unnecessary. Kadosh said, 'We are undertaking actions that were not part of previous operations. We are advancing into areas where the IDF will not need to return. This is not a raid; it is a full-scale operation aimed at completely dismantling the enemy and its infrastructure.' He added that although a large number of the terrorists are 'veteran' Hamas members, many have been enlisted recently. The Hamas terror organization has replaced a significant portion of its forces lost in combat with Israel since October 7, according to reports by Israeli media outlets. According to estimates from the Israeli military, the Gaza-based group had around 25,000 fighters in the coastal enclave before the October 7, 2023 invasion of southwestern Israel. Since then, the IDF estimates that between 17,000 and 20,000 Gaza-based terrorists have been killed, the majority of whom were from Hamas. Additionally, thousands have been rendered incapable of fighting due to injuries sustained during the conflict, and Israel has captured many others. Over 4,300 Gazans are currently being held by Israel, including many Hamas operatives. Despite these significant losses, Hamas has reportedly managed to replenish its ranks, according to a report by Israel's Channel 12. Together with the much smaller Palestinian Islamic Jihad organization, the two terror groups now have between 20,000 to 23,000 men under arms in the Gaza Strip, the report said. The source emphasized that regardless of the number terrorists commanded by Hamas before the war or at present, there has been a notable decline in the quality of its forces, with large numbers of untrained teenagers filling Hamas' ranks.

As ceasefire’s end approaches, Israeli officials doubt Lebanon’s ...	Jerusalem remains concerned about the Lebanese Armed Forces’ ability to fill the vacuum left by Hezbollah. By Baruch Yedid, TPS As the end of a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon approaches, Israeli officials are voicing skepticism about Beirut’s ability to enforce the agreement over the long term. A senior Israeli political source told The Press Service of Israel, 'Until January 27th, there is still an eternity in terms of the region. The decision to completely withdraw from Lebanon could be made even 24 hours before the end of the 60 days, and there is still a long process of electing a president in Lebanon, and more developments are expected in Syria. We are keeping the extension of the [Israel Defense Force’s] stay as an option for all intents and purposes.' Under the terms of a two-month ceasefire that went into effect on November 27, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its armed presence from areas of southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. Israeli forces will also withdraw from southern Lebanon in stages. The Lebanese Armed Forces is to be deployed in southern Lebanon including along the 120 km border with Israel, as will monitors from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. 'The first phase of the agreement is now a test for Israel and Lebanon. Can the Lebanese army confront Hezbollah and impose the terms of the agreement? If not, what happens after the 60 days?' the Israeli political source told TPS-IL. A second Israeli source familiar with US mediator Amos Hochstein’s efforts told TPS-IL Jerusalem remains concerned about the Lebanese Armed Forces’ ability to fill the vacuum left by Hezbollah. 'We are closely examining what is happening on the ground. If the Lebanese are not sufficiently deployed, then what happens on the 61st day will delay the continued implementation of the ceasefire,' he said. January 9 may be a critical juncture. That’s when Lebanon’s parliament gathers to elect a new president. President Michel Aoun’s six-year term ended in October 2023 and political deadlock has left the position vacant ever since. The election comes as Hezbollah is weakened by war and isolated by the overthrow of Syria’s Iran-backed government. By convention, the Lebanese presidency is held by a Maronite Christian. Hezbollah’s preferred candidate had been Suleiman Frangieh, a former cabinet minister, but Frangieh’s strength was his closeness to now-deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad. If a Hezbollah-backed candidate fails to win, it will lose significant political standing and possibly spur the Iran-backed terror group to return to war. The US, France and Saudi Arabia back Lebanese Army Chief Joseph Aoun. The ceasefire gives Israel the ability to respond to Hezbollah violations of the ceasefire, and Israeli forces have frequently uncovered weapons and terror infrastructure south of the Litani River. But repeated Lebanese accusations of 'Israeli violations have fueled tensions. A Lebanese MTV report suggested the U.S. might propose extending the ceasefire agreement for another 60 days to address these challenges. Meanwhile, Israel’s withdrawal from the town of Naqoura has begun. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

UN says Iran executed over 900 people in 2024, including dozens o...	One of the women executed for murder had killed her husband to prevent him from raping her daughter, stated UN rights office spokesperson Liz Throssell. By The Algemeiner and Reuters The number of people executed in Iran rose to 901 last year, including 31 women, some of whom were convicted of murdering their husbands to fend off rape or after being forced into marriage, the UN human rights office said on Tuesday. Most of the executions were for drug-related offenses, but political dissidents and people connected with mass protests in 2022 over the death in police custody of a 22-year-old woman were also among the victims, the UN statement said. 'It is deeply disturbing that yet again we see an increase in the number of people subjected to the death penalty in Iran year-on-year,' United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said in a statement sent to journalists. 'It is high time Iran stemmed this ever-swelling tide of executions.' In total, at least 901 people were executed by hanging last year in the Islamic Republic, compared with 853 in 2023, the UN rights office said. That represented the highest number since 2015, when 972 people were executed. Iran‘s diplomatic mission in Geneva did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the UN statement. The 2022 protests, which sparked some of the worst turmoil since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, followed the death in police detention of Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly flouting Iran‘s mandatory dress code. At least 31 women were executed in 2024, UN rights office spokesperson Liz Throssell told reporters at a Geneva press briefing, representing what she said was the highest number in at least 15 years. 'The majority of cases involved charges of murder. A significant number of the women were victims of domestic violence, child marriage or forced marriage,' she added. One of the women executed for murder had killed her husband to prevent him from raping her daughter, Throssell told Reuters after the briefing. Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist who won election as Iran‘s president in July 2024, made promises during his campaign to better protect the rights of women and minorities.

UAE in talks with US, Israel about provisional government for pos...	The diplomats and officials stressed the ideas that had emerged from the UAE talks lacked detail and had not been distilled into a formal, written plan nor adopted by any government. By The Algemeiner and Reuters The United Arab Emirates has discussed with Israel and the United States participating in a provisional administration of post–war Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority is able to take charge, according to people familiar with the talks. The behind-the-scenes discussions, reported by Reuters for the first time, included the possibility of the UAE and the United States, along with other nations, temporarily overseeing the governance, security, and reconstruction of Gaza after the Israeli military withdraws and until a Palestinian administration is able to take over, a dozen foreign diplomats and Western officials told Reuters. The UAE is a close security partner of the US and, unlike most Arab governments, has diplomatic ties with Israel. The diplomats and officials said this provides the Gulf state with some leverage over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. After more than a year of war, Israel remains reluctant to outline its own vision for Gaza and the international community has struggled to formulate a viable plan, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private. The diplomats and officials stressed the ideas that had emerged from the UAE talks lacked detail and had not been distilled into a formal, written plan nor adopted by any government. In the behind-the-scenes talks, Abu Dhabi is advocating for a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) to govern Gaza, Judea, Samaria, and East Jerusalem under an independent Palestinian state, the sources said — something that Israel has publicly opposed. 'The UAE will not participate in any plan that fails to include significant reform of the Palestinian Authority, its empowerment, and the establishment of a credible roadmap toward a Palestinian state,' a UAE official told Reuters, in response to questions about the discussions. 'These elements — which are currently lacking — are essential for the success of any post–Gaza plan.' The PA was established three decades ago under the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords, signed by Israel and Palestinians, and given limited authority over Judea and Samaria and Gaza. It still exercises limited self-governance in Judea and Samaria but was run out of Gaza in 2007 by Hamas after a brief civil war. A US State Department spokesperson told Reuters there had been talks with several partners, including the UAE, on options for governance, security, and reconstruction, and that various draft proposals, plans and ideas had been put forward by partners. 'These have been deliberative discussions that continue, as we seek the best way forward,' the spokesperson said, declining to comment further on 'private diplomatic conversations.' The Israeli prime minister’s office declined comment for this story. The Palestinian Authority did not respond to Reuters’ questions. In addition to reforming the PA, four of the diplomats and Western officials said that Emirati officials had suggested the use of private military contractors as part of a post–war peacekeeping force in Gaza. The other sources confirmed they were briefed on what they described as Emirati post–war proposals, which included the possible use of such forces. The diplomats and Western officials said any deployment of such contractors would spark concerns among Western nations. Private military contractors, hired by the United States and other governments, have faced accusations of torture, human rights abuses, and use of excessive force, among other allegations, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. The UAE official did not respond to questions about the use of military contractors. RECONSTRUCTION WILL TAKE YEARS Rebuilding Gaza, including its political institutions, is expected to take years and cost tens of billions of dollars, requiring substantial international support, following 15 months of the Israel-Hamas war. While the UAE has criticized the conduct of Israel‘s military and Netanyahu himself, Israel still wants the oil-rich nation involved in post–war Gaza, according to two former Israeli officials, who declined to be identified. Like Israel, the Gulf state opposes Hamas, a US-designated terrorist group that led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war. Abu Dhabi views Hamas and other Islamist groups as destabilizing forces. UAE officials have also expressed concern publicly over the war‘s impact on stability in the Middle East and on efforts towards greater regional integration and economic development. Asked whether Hamas was aware of proposals discussed by the UAE, Basem Naim, one of the organization’s senior officials, told Reuters that after the war, Gaza must be 'distinctly Palestinian' and without 'foreign interventions.' Washington is pushing, alongside mediators Egypt and Qatar, for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Israel and Hamas traded blame in late December for delays in reaching a ceasefire — which both sides had said appeared to be close last month. On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington wanted to see a ceasefire deal concluded in the next two weeks. When asked about the future of Gaza, Brian Hughes, a spokesman for Donald Trump’s transition team, said the US president-elect — who is due to take office on Jan. 20 — would work in close coordination with Arab and Israeli partners 'to ensure that Gaza can one day prosper.' REFORM OF PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY The Gulf state has said it would only send troops to a post–war multinational mission at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority and with the involvement of the US. Netanyahu, however, has said he is against the Palestinian Authority in its current form governing Gaza, citing his long-standing grievances over the PA’s school syllabus, which he says fuels hatred of Israel, and its policy of giving salaries to families of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel for their involvement in terrorist attacks and plots. The UAE has called for a new prime minister to lead the Palestinian Authority, which Emirati officials frequently criticized as corrupt and inept during the closed-door talks, the diplomats and officials said, without providing specifics. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, who took office in March, has pledged to implement reforms within the Palestinian Authority whose finances have been in disarray for years as donor states have cut back funding until corruption and waste are tackled. Emirati officials have mentioned former prime minister Salam Fayyad, a US-educated former World Bank official, as the type of person who would be credible to lead a revamped Palestinian Authority, according to the diplomats and officials. Fayyad served as prime minister from 2007 until resigning in 2013 after falling out with President Mahmoud Abbas, who remains in office. Reuters was unable to reach Fayyad for comment.

No hostage deal without full IDF withdrawal, end to war, Hamas de...	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is a 'partner' in war crimes against Gazans, Hamas claims, threatening to prosecute him for his alleged role in 'the war of extermination.' By World Israel News Staff A senior Hamas spokesman threatened to seek legal charges against a senior Biden administration official, while rejecting any compromise on the terror group's core demands in hostage deal talks with Israel. On Tuesday, senior Hamas spokesman and politburo member Osama Hamdan held a press conference in Algeria, discussing the war in Gaza, ceasefire talks, and the Biden administration. Hamdan pushed back on criticism by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who blamed Hamas intransigence for the failure to reach a ceasefire deal. 'His statements are misleading and we do not trust them, and his partnership in the crimes against our people will be pursued legally,' Hamdan said, accusing the American foreign affairs chief of being 'a partner in the war of extermination.' Turning to hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar, Hamdan said Hamas would not compromise on any of its core demands, insisting that no captives can be released until Israel agrees to a permanent end to the current war in Gaza and a full withdrawal of IDF forces from the Gaza Strip. 'Our stance is firm: A ceasefire, the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, prisoner exchanges, and Gaza’s reconstruction—no Israeli conditions.' Israel must agree to a 'complete end to the aggression and a full withdrawal from lands the occupation invaded,' Hamdan said. 'We are determined to stop the aggression and for the enemy to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and for relief and reconstruction to be without Israeli conditions,' Hamdan added. 'We hope that this will be achieved as soon as possible.' Regarding the administration of Gaza after the war, Hamdan said Hamas hopes to form a 'national committee' with other Palestinian Arab groups to govern the coastal enclave.

White House staff built a fortress around a fading President	Cabinet officials described a hierarchical structure where the White House simply handed down decisions and expected agencies to implement them, rather than involving cabinet secretaries in policy development. By Jewish Breaking News A coddled and increasingly confused Joe Biden has been trapped inside an elaborate protective bubble constructed by the president’s nervous staff. Multiple insiders revealed to the Washington Post that over the past few years a small cadre of trusted White House advisers implemented strict protocols for Biden that governed everything from meeting lengths to information flow. Senior Democratic lawmakers and even powerful cabinet members like Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen found their direct access to Biden increasingly limited, with key interactions often filtered through intermediaries like National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and senior counselor Steve Ricchetti. Cabinet officials described a hierarchical structure where the White House simply handed down decisions and expected agencies to implement them, rather than involving cabinet secretaries in policy development. Several officials noted difficulty in determining whether Biden’s limited engagement stemmed from age-related concerns or his preference for relying on a close-knit group of advisers. Meanwhile, press aides were instructed to exclude negative coverage from Biden’s news briefings, while presidential interactions became increasingly scripted. When meetings did occur, visitors were told to keep them focused and concise as the president’s energy and accuracy seemed to decline during lengthy sessions. 'I just thought that maybe the president just lost that fight,' Sen. Joe Manchin reflected on his meeting with Biden to the Journal. 'The ability to continue to stay on, just grind it, grind it, grind it.' During campaign events, donors were sometimes given pre-approved questions on notecards to read to the president. Even then, Biden occasionally stumbled, leaving donors puzzled when he made mistakes despite having the questions in advance. The turning point came after Biden’s disastrous June debate performance against Donald Trump made his cognitive challenges impossible to ignore. Despite mounting pressure over his candidacy, President Biden reportedly held a tense virtual meeting with the New Democrat Coalition on July 13. During the call, Biden insisted his polling numbers remained strong. However, when lawmakers challenged his assessment, the president grew visibly frustrated and abruptly ended the call. Eight days later, Biden dropped out of the race.

Israel shoots down nomination for new UN Mideast envoy	Jerusalem rejects United Nations nominee for new Middle East envoy, telling UN Secretary-General António Guterres to draft list of alternative candidates. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli government has rejected the nominee tapped to serve as the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Yedioth Aharanoth reported late Monday night. On November 21st, 2024, the previous UN Middle East envoy, Norway’s Tor Wennesland, announced his resignation from the position, after a rocky tenure. First appointed in December, 2020, Wennesland had been involved in mediating talks between Israel and Hamas prior to the October 7th, 2023 invasion. After the invasion, however, Wennesland admitted that he had misjudged Hamas. 'Politics failed,' he told The New York Times. 'Diplomacy failed. The international community failed. And the parties failed.' United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres recently submitted the nomination of a possible successor, former Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, to Israel for consideration. According to Monday night’s report, Israel rejected Haavisto, an ally of Guterres, over his close ties to the UN Secretary-General, marking a continuation of tensions between Jerusalem and the Portuguese politician who has served as chief UN officer since 2017. Israel also reportedly rejected Haavisto’s candidacy over his past criticisms of the Jewish state, his advocacy in favor of a two-state solution and the establishment of a Palestinian state, and concerns that if appointed, Haavisto would spark a further escalation of tensions between Jerusalem and the UN’s senior leadership. The Israeli government has requested that the United Nations submit a list of alternative candidates from which to choose a replacement for Wennesland. The decision not to accept Haavisto as Special Coordinator sends the matter back to Guterres, who is expected to consult with the United Nations Security Council and the Palestinian Authority.

Israel advances domestic defense manufacturing independence	The agreements were formalized in a signing ceremony with Defense Ministry Director General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and Elbit Systems President and CEO Bezhalel Machlis. By JNS On Tuesday, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced the signing of two significant agreements with Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems, valued at $275 million. These deals aim to advance domestic manufacturing independence and enhance local defense production. The first agreement focuses on the supply of thousands of munitions, while the second involves establishing a facility to produce critical raw materials for Israel’s defense industry. The agreements were formalized in a signing ceremony with Defense Ministry Director General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and Elbit Systems President and CEO Bezhalel Machlis.

'We initiated this historic move before the war, but accelerated it during the conflict,' said Zamir. 'Under both agreements, initial capabilities will soon expand, ultimately achieving full independence in both areas. This is a key lesson from the war that will empower the Israel Defense Forces to continue operating effectively in all theaters.' Machlis stated, 'Elbit Systems is a partner of the IDF and the Israeli Ministry of Defense in advancing the ‘Blue and White’ manufacturing policy and is committed to significantly contributing to the strengthening of the IDF’s munitions independence.'

Unmoved by Trump’s threats, Hamas demands post-war role in Gaza –...	The Gaza terror group reportedly is conditioning any release of Israeli hostages on Israel’s acceptance that Hamas will continue to play a role in governing the coastal enclave after the war. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization is demanding that it be guaranteed a role in governing the Gaza Strip even after the current war with Israel, according to a report by Israel’s national broadcaster, Kan. An Egyptian official cited by the report said that Hamas is insisting that any potential deal including the release of Israeli hostages also feature a provision enshrining the terror group’s right to a role in the post-war Gaza regime. Israel has hitherto insisted that the terror group be completely dismantled prior to the end of the war, and has refused proposals not only to enable Hamas to retain a role in governing Gaza after the war, but has also rejected suggestions that the Palestinian Authority’s ruling Fatah party assume control over the Gaza Strip. While President-elect Donald Trump has pressured Hamas to reach a deal with Israel to release the remaining 100 hostages – including repeated threats that there will be 'hell to pay' if the captives are not freed by inauguration day later this month – Trump’s remarks have had only a marginal influence on Hamas, the official said. Trump reiterated his threat on Monday, telling conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt that if 'If those hostages aren’t released by the time I get to office, there will be hell to pay.' The Egyptian source cited in the Kan report added that another barrier to an agreement is Israel’s hesitation in accepting a ceasefire which will mark the end of the war. Without Israel agreeing to conclude the war and a post-war role for Hamas in Gaza, the terror group is unlikely to even reach an agreement in hostage talks, the official said.

Israel-Turkey war a possibility, warns state commission	Nagel Committee, commissioned by Netanyahu government to assess military preparedness in face of looming threats, warns that Israel could face direct confrontation with Turkey, and must prepare for a possible war. By World Israel News Staff Israel could face a confrontation with Turkey, a state committee warned Monday, adding that a proxy conflict between the two could potentially escalate into a direct war. On Monday, the Nagel Committee submitted its findings to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Meeting with the ministers at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, the committee, headed by Prof. Jacob Nagel, discussed their report on Israel's military readiness and potential threats to state security, and the implications of both for the defense budget. The committee was commissioned by Netanyahu in August, to independently assess the needs of the IDF to confront changing threats Israel is likely to face over the next decade. Among the potential threats identified by the committee are Turkey and its proxies, chief among them Islamist rebel forces in Syria who have seized control over Damascus and who are now working to establish a new government. Warning of the possible dangers of an 'extremist Syrian force that also refuses to accept Israel's very existence,' the report noted in addition that the new Syrian leadership could bring Israel into a confrontation with the rebels' patron state, Turkey. 'The problem would escalate if the Syrian force practically became a 'Turkish' proxy, as part of Turkey's aspirations to restore the Ottoman legacy.' The positioning of Turkish forces within Syria, where Israel's military has operated regularly for over a decade - both to target pro-Iranian forces and to remove potential terrorist threats - could lead to the outbreak of a war between Israel and Turkey, the report hinted. 'The presence of Turkish proxies or forces in Syria could increase the risk of a direct Turkish-Israeli confrontation.' Turkey could also indirectly threaten Israel by aiding the new Syrian leadership in rebuilding the country's shattered military. 'Establishing strong ties with Turkey would shorten the process of the emergence of a new Syrian-Turkish threat.' 'In this context, it must be taken into account that the entry of the Turkish military into Syria could lead to the arming of Syria at a relatively rapid pace.' More broadly, the committee warned of possible 'drastic changes' in Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority that could lead to increased strategic threats to Israel.

Houthi deal? Biden releases 11 Yemenis from Guantanamo Bay	Eleven Yemeni nationals transferred to Oman, ahead of expected closure of Guantanamo Bay. By World Israel News Staff Eleven terrorists with Yemeni citizenship who were imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay were released by the Biden administration and transferred to Oman, the Pentagon said on Monday. The transfer comes as the Biden administration aims to shutter the military prison, which currently holds just 15 detainees. 'Although different processes, each of the Yemeni detainees underwent a thorough, interagency review by career professionals who unanimously determined all detainees as transfer eligible consistent with the national security interests of the United States,' the Department of Defense said in a statement. 'The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Oman and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility,' the DoD added. Moath Hamza Ahmed al-Alwi, an alleged al Qaeda terrorists and bodyguard for Osama bin Laden, was named as one of the 11 freed Yemenis. According to the New York Post, al-Awli was described in declassified documents as making 'several statements since early 2016 that suggest he maintains an extremist mindset.' Another freed Yemeni, Suhayl Abdul Anam al Sharabi, was said to have possibly been 'associated with an aborted 9/11-style hijacking plot in Southwest Asia' as a member of al Qaeda. According to the Washington Post, earlier Yemeni transferees to Oman have receied extensive support, likely paid for by the U.S. government. 'A previous group of Guantánamo detainees transferred to Oman were given housing, access to social welfare benefits — including health care, jobs and cars — and assistance starting, or reuniting with, families,' the Post reported. The release of the Yemenis comes amid repeated Houthi attacks against Israel and American military assets in the Middle East. U.S. efforts to deter the Houthis, including airstrikes on their territory in Yemen, have largely failed to stop the attacks. The post Houthi deal?

‘We built an igloo’ – Israelis rescued from freezing mountain	Three Israeli snowboarders rescued after getting stranded at summit of Mount Shiroma in Japan. By World Israel News Staff Three Israeli snowboarders were rescued on Tuesday after being trapped at the summit of a freezing mountain in Japan for nearly 24 hours. The men, identified by Hebrew-language media as Dor Mordechai, Yoav David and Yair Raz Yaya, deviated from an official trail on Mount Shirouma. Speaking to Ynet, David explained that the trio had planned to explore a well-known backcountry route, but due to a 'navigation' error found themselves stranded. The men, who are all IDF reservists, had a cellphone with which they were able to call for help. The Israeli Consulate in Japan, along with local Japanese police and rescue forces, were unable to immediately rescue the Israelis due to weather conditions. 'We built an igloo and cuddled together to stay warm,' David told Ynet. 'There were tough moments throughout the night, like when they told us it was impossible for us to be rescued by helicopter and that we'd need to spend the night in the snow, when we were already dehydrated and temperatures were low.' The recued men were transported to a local hospital, where they are in good condition despite suffering mild hypothermia and frostbite. In a statement, Israeli Ambassador to Japan Gilad Cohen thanked 'the extraordinary efforts of the Japanese police and the erscue forces on the ground for making the extraction possible.' Cohen also thanked 'the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the U.S. Embassy in Japan for their cooperation and assistance. The lives of Israelis abroad are our top priority.' 'The operations room team worked around the clock in full cooperation with the Israeli consulate, the unit for Israelis abroad, and the local police,' said Magnus Search and Rescue, a group that organizes extractions of Israelis abroad from life-threatening situations. 'Our efforts, in cooperation with all parties involved, led to the best result - the safe return of the travelers home. This is a moment of satisfaction and pride for all of us.'

‘They fought heroically’ – 2 IDF soldiers killed in Gaza	Deaths of Dvir Revach, 28, and Eitan Shkenazi, 24, bring total number of IDF soldiers killed since October 7th to 827. By World Israel News Staff Two Israeli soldiers were killed in battle in the Gaza Strip on Monday by antitank fire, with two others seriously wounded in the same incident. Major Dvir Zion Revah, 28, from Jerusalem, fell in the northern Strip. He served as a Company Commander in the Nahal Brigade's 932 Battalion, the IDF said in a statement. Revah's deputy, Eitan Shkenazi, 24, from Eli, was also killed in the attack, which saw Hamas terrorists launch an antitank missile at a building where soldiers were gathered. Shkenazi is survived by his wife, Hallel. He is the 10th soldier to fall in battle from his hometown of Eli since the beginning of the October 7th war. In a statement, Defense Minister Israel Katz eulogied Revah and Shkenazi, calling them 'Isreali heroes who fell in a battle against Hamas murderers.' Katz priased the slain soldiers for leading 'their fighters with courage and determination, for the security of the state. My heart goes out to their families and loved ones in these painful moments.' 'Eitan, deputy company commander&#8230;fought heroically and led his soldiers in the Nahal Brigade on their way to destroy the enemy, until he fell in battle,' Binyamin Regional Council head Israel Ganz said in a statement. 'He was raised and educated with self-sacrifice and the love of the nation and the Land, and that is how he lived - and how he fell. At this difficult hour, we embrace his dear wife Hallel, his parents, and his entire family. The entire nation of Israel is with you.' According to IDF statistics, Shkenazi and Revah's deaths bring the total of soldiers killed on or since October 7, 2023, to 827. 392 of those casualties fell during the ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, which began in late October 2023.

‘I’m with Israel’ – Trump doubles down on threats to Hamas if hos...	The hostages have to get out now,' says President-elect Donald Trump, reiterating his threat to Hamas that there will be 'hell to pay' if captives not freed by the time he takes office on January 20th. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump warned Monday that there 'will be hell to pay' if the remaining 100 hostages held in the Gaza Strip are not released by the time he takes office on January 20th. Echoing comments made via social media on the eve of the presidential election, Trump told conservative pundit and radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt that he is Israel's 'best friend,' touting his policies during his first term as president. 'I’m the best friend that Israel ever had,' said Trump. 'You look at what happened with all of the things that I’ve gotten, including Jerusalem being the capital, the embassy getting built. I got it built.' 'And of course, the Abraham Accords. Every major event that’s happened to Israel over the last fairly short period of time has been given through me. So I’m with Israel. I think that’s pretty obvious to everybody.' Trump called for the immediate release of the hostages held by Hamas and other terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip, warning that there would be 'hell to pay' if the captives are not freed by the time he takes office on January 20th. He also hinted at the use of force, criticizing President Joe Biden's statement in October 7th, warning Iran and its allies not to escalate the war. 'Exactly what it says. If those hostages aren’t released by the time I get to office, there will be hell to pay,' Trump continued. 'I don’t think I have to go into it anymore. It won’t be the word 'don’t'&#8230; There will be hell to pay. Those hostages have to get out. They have to get out now.' On the eve of last month's election, Trump took to his Truth Social account to warn criticize Biden's handling of the crisis, and to warn that there would be 'all hell to pay' if the hostages were not released by inauguration day.

Terrorist files medical malpractice suit for injuries sustained d...	Tel Aviv District Prosecutor's Office submitted the request for dismissal of the claim on the grounds that the state does not owe damages to a member of a terrorist organization who attacks Israelis. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's State Prosecution has requested a dismissal of medical malpractice claim made by a terrorist for injuries sustained during his attack against IDF soldiers, Arutz Sheva reports. Tel Aviv District Prosecutor's Office submitted the request for dismissal on the grounds that the state does not owe damages to a member of a terrorist organization who commits destructive acts against individuals and the State of Israel even after leaving prison. In October 2015, the terrorist who made the claim went from his home in Dura close to Hebron and entered Negohot in Samaria with a rifle and a knife, intending to attack Israeli security forces. When soldiers saw him, they fired, and he sustained injuries for which he received medical treatment in prison. The military court convicted the terrorist to 40 months in prison. Like many terrorists, he received money from the Palestinian Authority for his terrorist activity. On social media, his posts regularly praise Hamas, defame Israel, and encourage others to carry out terror attacks and seek 'martyrdom.' He also praised Hamas for carrying out atrocities against Israelis on October 7 and encouraged Palestinians to take Jewish captives. The prosecution seeks an outright dismissal of the convicted terrorist's claim and said, 'There is no justification for compensating individuals involved in terrorism for damages they claim, particularly when they are actively working against the State of Israel or its citizens.' On January 2, the Israeli NGO Regavim, which focuses on protecting the country's national lands and resources, published a detailed report revealing the involvement of members of the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF) in terrorist activities targeting Israelis. The report, titled *'Officers by Day—Terrorists by Night,'* documents that at least 16 PASF members were killed while carrying out attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers. In total, over 80 PASF members were killed, injured, or arrested between 2021 and 2023 for their participation in similar acts of terrorism.

El Al gives away free miles to over 80,000 IDF reservists	In total, some 81,000 reservists received the free points for a total of 18 million cumulative days of reserve duty, the airline said. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS Israel’s flagship carrier El Al gave out 1.8 billion miles to more than 80,000 Israel Defense Forces reservists in a 48-hour promotion this past week in recognition of their military service. The offer came amid a national public outcry and an ongoing investigation into allegations of price gouging over the last 15 months when the national carrier had a virtual monopoly on many routes, including the lucrative transatlantic flights to New York, after most foreign carriers suspended service to and from Tel Aviv. The short-lived promotion, which overwhelmed the carrier’s website and ended Wednesday, was available to reservists who were called up for more than 100 days of service, and gave them 100 frequent flyer points for each day served. In total, some 81,000 reservists received the free points for a total of 18 million cumulative days of reserve duty, the airline said. The total cost of the mileage giveaway, which was heavily advertised on television as well as on social media, was in the tens of thousands of shekels. In addition, reservists who served at least 60 days were offered full cash refunds for canceled flights, seat upgrades and extra baggage allowances. However, tens of thousands of eligible reservists were left disappointed as they did not manage to get through to claim their miles. While El Al has won accolades for flying continuously throughout the war, it has been heavily criticized for exorbitant pricing over the last 15 months when it raked in record-breaking profits. One video circulating in Israel decried the promotion as a 'dirty trick' that sought to cover up the carrier’s overcharging during the war by usage of slick marketing. Multiple foreign airlines have resumed service to Israel over the last month reducing prices to Europe, although the three major U.S. legacy carriers have not restarted flights to Israel yet.

Drill, baby, drill: Trump vows to reverse Biden’s ‘ridiculous’ of...	Trump, who is set to take office in two weeks, has repeatedly promised to roll back Biden’s climate change initiatives and restore American 'energy dominance.' By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Affirming his pledge to ramp up domestic energy production, President-elect Donald Trump on Monday vowed to reverse President Joe Biden’s 'ridiculous' ban on new offshore oil drilling and natural gas development across U.S. coastal waters. 'I see it just came over that Biden has banned all oil and gas drilling across 625 million acres of U.S. coastal territory. It's ridiculous. I'll unban it immediately,' Trump said in an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt. Biden’s ban covers new oil and gas development on all federal waters off the East and West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and portions of the northern Bering Sea in Alaska, according to Reuters. The move comes as Democratic lawmakers and environmental organizations have urged Biden to 'maximize permanent protections' against offshore drilling in the final weeks of his presidency. Trump, who is set to take office in two weeks, has repeatedly promised to roll back Biden’s climate change initiatives and restore American 'energy dominance.' 'This is a disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices,' Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday. 'Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby, drill.' The White House said Biden is invoking his authority under the 70-year-old Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which allows presidents to block areas from drilling and mineral leasing. The ban may be difficult for Trump to reverse as the Lands Act does not grant presidents the authority to overturn prior bans, according to a 2019 court ruling. 'Drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation's energy needs. It is not worth the risks,' Biden said in a statement. Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, slammed Biden’s decision as 'politically motivated,' urging Congress to 'use every tool at their disposal to reverse' the move and 'restore a pro-American energy approach to federal leasing.' Biden sold off nearly half of the U.S. oil reserve in 2022, with some going to the Chinese Communist Party and other foreign entities. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve now holds fewer than 400 million barrels, down from almost 600 million at the start of 2022.

UN accused of funding illegal construction in Israeli nature rese...	A sign near the pipeline claims the pipeline extends 5.8 kilometers and was constructed between October 2018 and January 2019 by a contractor identified as MEDCO Company. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Illegal water pipeline infrastructure bearing the logo of the UN Humanitarian Fund has been running through the heart of a protected nature reserve in the Judean Desert in violation of Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements, The Press Service of Israel can report. 'The UN is advancing the establishment of a Palestinian state at any cost, disregarding laws and agreements, and funding illegal construction—even in areas where the Palestinians explicitly agreed not to build,' legal expert Maurice Hirsch told The Press Service of Israel. 'This is a glaring example of negligence by Israel in the face of blatant violations,' added Hirsch, the former Director of the Military Prosecution for Judea and Samaria and current Director of the Initiative for Palestinian Authority Accountability and Reform at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. The area, known as the Judean Desert Nature Reserve, was originally designated as Area B, meaning it came under Palestinian Authority administrative jurisdiction and Israeli security responsibility. However, the 41,000-acre reserve, was enshrined as a 'no-build' zone under the 1998 Wye River Memorandum. However recent findings highlight systematic violations, apparently financed through international funding. A visit to the reserve in August revealed vast stretches of illegal construction, including villas, swimming pools, and the water pipeline. A sign near the pipeline credited funding to the UN Humanitarian Fund (UNHF), with claims suggesting the infrastructure serves illegal structures nearby. A separate sponsorship sign said the pipeline was funded by the UN Humanitarian Fund and implemented by the Arab Agronomists Association (AAA) in partnership with the municipality of Zatara, a Palestinian village southeast of Bethlehem. The sign claims the pipeline extends 5.8 kilometers and was constructed between October 2018 and January 2019 by a contractor identified as MEDCO Company. The sign also contained the coding 'OPT-18/DDA-3482/SA1/WASH/NGO/8999.' OPT commonly refers to 'Occupied Palestinian Territories' in UN documents. 'We’re looking at a UN-funded water pipeline project allegedly aimed at assisting marginalized communities, yet it’s located inside a nature reserve—a zone that should be protected from such activities,' said Naomi Kahn of Regavim, a non-governmental organization that monitors illegal Palestinian construction in Judea and Samaria. 'Not only is this infrastructure illegally placed within the reserve, but it is also supplying water to illegally built homes, not agricultural communities,' explained Kahn, who is director Regavim’s international division. Hirsch questioned the legality of the UN’s involvement in the project, stressing that international organizations are expected to act as neutral parties and respect local laws. 'There’s no need to negotiate with the UN about this illegal activity,' Hirsch told TPS-IL. 'These infrastructures should be dismantled immediately. Their actions—falsely claiming these funds are for communities far from the reserve—are blatantly dishonest.' An online search for MEDCO Company found no results beyond references to UN-funded pipeline projects, raising concerns about the firm’s legitimacy as a contractor. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) listed the project under the same code and provided additional financial details. According to OCHA, the Arab Agronomists Association received multiple payments totaling over $245,000 for the project, officially spanning from May 2018 to February 2019. However, observations on the ground reveal that the infrastructure primarily supports illegal construction within the Judean Desert Nature Reserve — a significant distance from Zatara, the community the project was allegedly meant to benefit. 'And even if this was built in Area C, did they secure the necessary permits? Everything is a lie upon a lie. Israel repeatedly turns a blind eye to such violations, and it simply doesn’t work,' Hirsch told TPS-IL. 'In recent years, the UN has increased the level of secrecy surrounding its funding to the Palestinians in order to shield its work from public scrutiny,' Anne Herzberg, Legal Advisor of NGO Monitor told TPS-IL. 'Donor nations should withhold funding and UN agencies should be blocked from operating in the region until its work is open to taxpayers for a full investigation and review,' she noted. OCHA did not respond to TPS-IL’s inquiries regarding the pipeline’s sponsorship or the MEDCO Company’s credentials. Illegal construction in the reserve has surged in recent years. Aerial surveys conducted by the NGO Regavim identified over 3,400 illegal structures in the reserve—up from just 268 at the time of the Wye River agreement. Israel began razing illegal Palestinian buildings inside the nature reserve in December. During the August tour of the reserve, TPS-IL also witnessed expansive illegal construction spanning kilometers, piles of construction debris and trash as well as scorch marks in the ground left behind by the burning of garbage. There were buildings in various stages of construction, ranging from still-wet cement foundations to a completed building resembling a guest house with a swimming pool. In response to enforcement queries, the Israel Defense Force’s Spokesperson’s Unit confirmed in January that responsibility for addressing illegal construction in the reserve was recently transferred to the military under directives from the Israeli government. 'In light of the Palestinian Authority’s violation of the Interim Agreement, enforcement responsibility in the reserve was transferred to the IDF,' the spokesperson told TPS-IL. 'Authorities have begun taking action under this directive.' The IDF declined to comment specifically on the UN-sponsored pipeline or its role in the illegally built compound.

By Pesach Benson, TPS The three Israelis killed in Monday’s shooting attack near Kedumim were identified as two retired educators and a police officer. The three were killed in the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq, near the town of Kedumim when terrorists opened fire on a bus and several vehicles. Another eight were injured. Israeli security forces are searching for two suspects seen in security footage taken at the scene. Police Master Sgt. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein, 36, fired at the terrorists before being fatally shot. A resident of the nearby community of Ein HaNatziv, Winkelstein is survived by his wife and two children. One of Winkelstein’s sons was in the car during the attack. He will be laid to rest in Jerusalem on Monday evening. Rachel Cohen, 73, and Aliza Raiz, 69, were both retired school counselors and residents of Kedumim. Cohen is survived by her husband and five daughters. Reiss, who was due to celebrate her 70th birthday in the coming days, is survived by her husband and children. Their funeral arrangements have not been announced yet. An eyewitness told The Press Service of Israel that the attack was 'a shooting spree.' Meanwhile, the Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba, where six of the victims were treated, said one man in his 60s was released from the operating room but remains in life-threatening condition. Another victim is in mild condition while four more were treated in the emergency room and released. Two women in their 70s and 80s were taken to the Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikvah with moderate injuries.

16 PA security personnel killed while attacking Israelis	This pattern of behavior remains unchanged. The Palestinian Authority not only fails to oppose terrorism, it actively endorses it,' the researchers concluded. By Josh Hasten, JNS Israeli NGO Regavim, dedicated to the protection of the country’s national lands and resources, released an extensive report on Jan. 2 highlighting the involvement of members of the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF) in terrorism targeting Israelis. No fewer than 16 PASF members were killed while attacking Israeli civilians and soldiers, the report, titled 'Officers by Day—Terrorists by Night,' reveals. More than 80 were killed, injured or arrested between 2021 and 2023 while engaging in comparable acts of terrorism. 'The Palestinian Authority’s involvement in encouraging and promoting terrorism goes beyond direct acts of violence, as the P.A. publicly celebrates terrorists who are not on the PASF payroll by providing military-style honor guards and funerals, particularly for those affiliated with Hamas,' Regavim added. While the PASF are cracking down on Islamist terrorists in P.A.-controlled cities, especially Jenin, Regavim’s researchers concluded that such confrontations are actually 'a means of consolidating the Palestinian Authority’s power and legitimacy as the best alternative for ‘the day after’ the ongoing war—in Judea and Samaria, as well as in Gaza.' Moshe Shmueli, director of Regavim’s Field Division and a high-ranking officer in the IDF reserves intimately familiar with the issue, said, 'These operations can best be described as window dressing—too little and far too late to be taken seriously. The P.A. is not part of the solution, it has been neck-deep in terrorism for decades, and recent theatrics have not changed the DNA of PASF.' The Regavim report shared that 'the P.A. honors fallen terrorists from the very same groups that are now ostensibly being targeted by [its] enforcement activities, naming streets, public squares, and even schools and educational programs after them, embedding their legacy into the community’s daily life. 'This glorification extends into cultural and educational domains, where terrorists are extolled through music, poetry and school curricula, influencing the next generation. 'Additionally, the P.A.’s ‘pay-for-slay’ program offers financial incentives to terrorists and their families, thereby economically rewarding acts of terrorism. 'This pattern of behavior remains unchanged. The Palestinian Authority not only fails to oppose terrorism, it actively endorses it,' the researchers concluded. The P.A. is protecting itself Maurice Hirsch, director of the Initiative for Palestinian Authority Accountability and Reform at the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs and the former director of the Military Prosecution in Judea and Samaria, commented on the report, telling JNS, 'The PASF has played a leading role in Palestinian terror against Israel for over two and a half decades. P.A. officials openly gloat about the fact. 'The Oslo delusion envisaged nothing more than a P.A. police force,' he added. However, the P.A. 'has built a huge terror army. That army has been funded and trained by both the U.S. and the Europeans. 'While the PASF either actively participated in terror or ignored the efforts of the other terror organizations to attack Israel and Israelis, it only kicked into action against Palestinians, as we are seeing in Jenin, when those terrorists threatened the Fatah’s dictatorial rule,' Hirsch said. Likud MK Dan Illouz told JNS, 'The P.A. is not a peace partner—it is a terror regime in suits. Its ‘security forces’ are nothing more than terrorists with badges, murdering Israelis while pretending to fight extremism. This is not a bug in the system, it is the system. It’s not infiltration, it’s policy.' The P.A. has 'fueled terror, paying salaries to murderers, glorifying jihad and inciting genocide against Jews' for decades. 'Enough with the illusions—this is a factory of hatred, not a future state,' he said. 'Israel must end all cooperation, cut all funding, and expose the P.A. for what it truly is—a clear and present danger to peace,' Illouz said. Next steps Naomi Kahn, director of Regavim’s International Division, told JNS, 'It’s time to stop living in the fantasy world in which the Palestinian Authority is a ‘moderating force,’ a ‘partner for peace,’ a ‘legitimate alternative’ for autonomous Arab governance of any territory from which terrorism can continue to threaten the lives of Israeli citizens. 'Regavim has been monitoring official Palestinian Authority publications, where the uncomfortable truth is clearly and repeatedly stated at every opportunity,' Kahn said. 'The P.A. will never stop funding, supporting and actively participating in violence against Israelis, and has never abandoned the raison d’être of the PLO, the founding pillar of the Palestinian Authority: the eradication of the State of Israel and the ethnic cleansing—through local and internationalized violent ‘resistance’—of every Jew from the Middle East.' Therefore, the Israeli government 'has a moral obligation to disempower these genocidal forces, to protect the lives of Jewish and non-Jewish citizens of Israel, to fight the forces of jihadism, and to reclaim historical, moral, political rights to life, liberty and sovereignty for the Jewish people in the Land of Israel,' Kahn said. MK Ohad Tal of the Religious Zionism Party told JNS he agreed that the P.A. must go. 'The fact that the Palestinian Authority and its officers encourage, support and even participate in terrorism is not new. Therefore, any call to strengthen the P.A. is a call to spread terrorism. After October 7, we are done fooling ourselves—the Palestinian Authority must be dismantled!' Tal said.

Justin Trudeau set to resign as party leader, drop out of race fo...	Facing a sinking approval rating and growing dissent within his own party, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reportedly is poised to resign as Liberal Party chairman, effectively dropping out of this year's race for premier. By World Israel News Staff Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is poised to announce his resignation as leader of the ruling Liberal Party this week, multiple Canadian media outlets reported over the weekend. According to sources cited by The Globe and Mail, Trudeau will likely make his formal announcement this week, sometime before a national caucus meeting this Wednesday. While the sources said that no final decision had been made on such an announcement, it appears likely Trudeau will resign in the near future. It is unclear whether Trudeau will stay on as premier to serve out the remainder of his term, or step down as prime minister immediately. Trudeau has served as Canada's head of government for nine years, through three federal elections, and is currently slated to remain in office through the next election, to be held no later than this October. Once boasting an approval rating of 65%, Trudeau now faces widespread disapproval in the Canadian electorate, with an approval rating of just 16%, according to an Angus Reid Institute poll released last week. 'It represents the lowest level of support for the party in Angus Reid Institute tracking dating back to 2014. It is also quite possibly the lowest vote intention the Liberals have ever received in the modern era,' the pollster said in a press release. Facing a general election sometime no later than October, the Liberal Party under Trudeau has seen its polling numbers sink, giving the Conservatives, under Pierre Poilievre, a significant lead. Trudeau's Liberal Party narrowly lost the popular vote to the Conservatives in 2021, while still winning a plurality of seats in Canada's House of Commons. Now, however, polls show the Conservatives receiving anywhere between 43% and 48% of the popular vote, while the latest Angus Reid poll gives the Liberals just 16%. Amid his poor polling numbers, Trudeau now faces a coup from his own party, including widespread calls for his resignation and the surprise departure of deputy premier and finance chief Chrystia Freeland from the Trudeau government. In a scathing letter, Freeland blasted Trudeau's 'political gimmicks.'

100,000 shekels and weapons seized in counter-terror raid	Wanted terrorist killed in shoot-out with security forces; explosives laboratory discovered at his home. By World Israel News Staff A counter-terror raid carried out on Sunday by Border Police unearthed nearly 100,000 shekels in cash, numerous guns and ammunition, and an explosives laboratory. Hassan Raba'a, a resident of Meithalun, a PA-controlled town in Samaria, began shooting at officers as they attempted to arrest him on terror charges. During the firefight, the man was shot dead. A search of his body found that he was carrying two handguns. After a subsequent search of his home, Border Police officers seized a shotgun, pipe bombs, ammunition, and 96,000 shekels in cash ($26,000). A warehouse on the man's property, which was being used for manufacturing explosives, was destroyed by security forces. Also on Sunday, during a routine inspection at the entrance to Nablus (Shechem), troops stopped a vehicle which was found to be carrying 20 pistols and cartridges. The driver was arrested and taken for questioning. Last week, in a joint operation between the Shin Bet, Border Police, and IDF, security forces carried out an undercover operation to arrest a wanted terrorist. Dressed in civilian clothes, security forces detained the man at a cafe in Nablus. After the suspect was arrested, violent clashes broke out between locals and security forces. Some threw firebombs, rocks, and other projectiles at the troops as they withdrew from the city. Security forces responded by shooting several of the rioters and neutralizing the threat, according to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Mako. According to analysts, Iran has been stepping up it attempts to smuggle weapons to Palestinian terrorists in Judea and Samaria in recent months. 'Iran is using its bases in Syria and the Captagon [amphetamine]-running networks to bring in weapons into Jordan and from there to Samaria — the ‘River’ Jordan is a creek,' Col. (res.) Eran Lerman, vice president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS), told JNS. 'They are also using Muslim Brotherhood infrastructures in Jordan to mobilize terrorists.'

Trump takes aim at Kamala’s ‘illegal’ pre-interview campaign paym...	Last year, Trump posted that, if reelected, he would investigate Comcast over what he called 'one-side[d] and vicious coverage' from the media conglomerate's flagship news channels, NBC and MSNBC. By Chuck Ross, The Washington Free Beacon President-elect Donald Trump accused MSNBC host Al Sharpton of taking illegal donations from the Kamala Harris campaign ahead of softball interviews with the Democrat last year, potentially spelling trouble for MSNBC and its parent company Comcast ahead of a planned corporate spinoff. In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump accused the Harris campaign of seeking to 'illegally buy endorsements' from Sharpton and celebrities like Beyoncé Knowles and Oprah Winfrey prior to the election. Trump's remarks were based on a Washington Free Beacon report that the Harris campaign donated $500,000 to Sharpton's nonprofit, the National Action Network, weeks before the activist interviewed Harris on his MSNBC show, PoliticsNation. 'Totally against the law,' Trump asserted. The comments raise questions about whether Trump could take action in his second presidential term to block Comcast's proposed spinoff of its news networks. The media giant in November announced plans to spin off NBC, MSNBC, and CNBC into a separate public company—a bid to separate its movie studios from the dwindling cable TV business. Comcast and MSNBC did not return requests for comment. At least one industry expert said that while he did not expect the spinoff to face headwinds from federal agencies, Trump was an 'X factor' that could gum up the process. Trump could 'slow-down or otherwise interfere with the transaction,' said investment analyst Blair Levin, who noted that MSNBC is a 'major Trump nemesis.' Last year, Trump posted that, if reelected, he would investigate Comcast over what he called 'one-side[d] and vicious coverage' from the media conglomerate's flagship news channels, NBC and MSNBC. And Trump could be emboldened to take on the media conglomerate after winning a $15 million legal settlement last month with ABC News over comments from host George Stephanopoulos, who falsely claimed Trump was found liable for raping a woman in the 1990s. Trump has stymied other media conglomerates in the past. Before the 2016 election, he came out against the proposed $85 billion merger between AT&T and Time Warner, the owner of the anti-Trump news channel CNN. The Department of Justice under Trump sued to block the merger in 2017. The merger was completed in 2018, but the companies spent years in court fighting the DOJ's lawsuit and subsequent appeal. Trump's new focus on the Harris campaign's payments to Sharpton's nonprofit could provide the impetus for him to get involved in the MSNBC spinoff. Trump did not describe what he believes is illegal about the Harris campaign's donations to the National Action Network, which Sharpton launched in 1991, the same year he stoked the anti-Semitic Crown Heights riots in New York City. MSNBC has tried to distance itself from the Sharpton donation, telling the Free Beacon that it was 'unaware' of the payment. The network, which prohibits employees from engaging in political activity without corporate approval, has declined to describe its discussions with Sharpton on the issue. The Society of Professional Journalists, a prominent media watchdog group, called the conflict of interest a 'black eye' that 'harms the credibility of the journalist, the news organization, and journalism overall.' Sharpton has been accused of using the National Action Network as a personal piggybank and wielding power against corporations. Sharpton landed his MSNBC show in 2011, a year after Comcast hired him to lobby on behalf of the media giant's merger with NBCUniversal. Sharpton's questionable lobbying role had generated scrutiny from outlets such as the New York Times, which wrote that it 'raises issues about [a] possible MSNBC job.' Byron Allen, one of the most successful black media moguls in the country, sued Comcast, Sharpton, and National Action Network in 2015 over what he called 'sham diversity agreements' between Sharpton and Comcast. Allen alleged that Sharpton 'has a business model and track record of obtaining payments from corporate entities in exchange for his support.' The National Action Network paid Sharpton more than $650,000 in salary in 2023, according to tax filings obtained by the Free Beacon. Sharpton and the National Action Network have not responded to numerous requests for comment. The Harris campaign's donation to the National Action Network came as it gave more than $5 million to black and Latino groups, seemingly to turn out voters in those demographics. The campaign gave $2 million to the National Urban League and $120,000 to Casa in Action, a Latino voter group. Those groups' leaders did not also work at major news organizations. The Harris campaign doled out millions more to celebrities and musicians who endorsed Harris at campaign rallies before the election. The campaign paid $2 million to Winfrey's production company after Winfrey hosted an arena event for Harris on September 19. The campaign paid $165,000 to Knowles's production company and $75,000 to Bruce Springsteen's company, the Free Beacon reported. Knowles endorsed Harris at a campaign event in Houston on October 25, though she did not perform any songs, much to the chagrin of Harris supporters and Knowles fans. Trump posted this week that 'Beyoncé didn't sing, Oprah didn't do much of anything … and Al is just a third rate Con Man.'

Israeli NBA sensation Deni Avdija’s career soars in Portland	Avdija's standout performances have earned him a starting spot for the Trail Blazers, who are currently 13th in the Western Conference with a 12-22 record. By Joshua Marks, JNS Deni Avdija, the Israeli NBA basketball player, is experiencing a career surge in the Pacific Northwest after being traded to the Portland Trail Blazers on July 6. The 24-year-old small forward, hailing from Beit Zera, a kibbutz just south of the Sea of Galilee, was a finalist for Player of the Month in the Western Conference for December, narrowly missing out to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder. During December, Avdija averaged 16.8 points (43.1% from three-point range), 5.2 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game. On January 3, his 24th birthday, he posted an impressive 19 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 assists in a 114-106 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Just two days later, Avdija excelled in a 105-102 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, securing another double-double with 19 points and 14 rebounds in a season-high 43 minutes of play. These standout performances have earned him a starting spot for the Trail Blazers, who are currently 13th in the Western Conference with a 12-22 record. Avdija was drafted ninth overall by the Washington Wizards in the 2020 NBA Draft, where he played for four seasons at the Capital One Arena before his recent trade. Before his NBA career, Avdija made his mark with Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv from 2017 to 2020, leading the team to three domestic league titles. He also won back-to-back gold medals at the FIBA U20 European Championship in 2018 in Germany and 2019 in Israel. His accolades include being named Israeli League MVP in 2020 and FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship MVP in 2019.

Israel raided Gaza hospital under full Hamas control with fake do...	Israel's Unit 504 investigators discovered that the hospital director was involved in planning and coordinating terror activity. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An IDF interrogation of Hamas terrorists revealed that the terror group was in complete control of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, Gaza, N12 reports. Israel's Unit 504 investigators discovered that the hospital director was involved in planning and coordinating terror activity and that Hamas terrorists planned to escape from the hospital in ambulances when the IDF raid began. The IDF and Shin Bet, Israel's security forces, raided the hospital last Friday on intelligence that terrorists were using the hospital as a headquarters. Around 240 Hamas terrorists were arrested in the raid, including many who participated in the October 7 massacre. An IDF reservist described his interrogation of a Hamas terrorist, who admitted that the hospital director was instrumental in directing terrorist activity. The reservist said, 'We discovered that the individual at the center of the event, orchestrating the terror and Hamas activities within the compound, was the hospital director himself.' The reservist added that Dr. Abu Safiyeh, the hospital director, 'strutted around like a peacock, certain that he wouldn't be arrested and fully convinced he was in control of the situation.' A second reservist confirmed that the hospital director was a member of Hamas. Abu Safiyeh 'really did walk around like a peacock' he said. 'He watched as his doctors were incriminated one by one, still convinced he wouldn't face arrest.' He added, 'But we soon saw through his disguise—it was nothing more than a facade. They were terrorists with blood on their hands. The hospital director finally realized that the entire ruse had unraveled, and in the end, he too was arrested.' Working in coordination with COGAT, the IDF completed the evacuation of 350 patients and medical professionals from the facility prior to the raid. Some of the 'patients' were really Hamas terrorists in disguise. Israel's military also ensured the delivery of food, fuel, and medical supplies to keep the treatment areas functioning. In addition, 95 patients and staff were transferred to the Indonesian hospital in Gaza, along with two generators and thousands of liters of essential supplies. The 401st brigade, located around the perimeter of the hospital, arrested terrorists and eliminated those who attacked troops or resisted arrest. Israeli special forces found in the hospital an arsenal of weapons, including grenades, firearms, and other military equipment.

Hostage list raises hopes Israel family still alive, PM denies re...	List of hostages purportedly provided by Hamas to Israel raises hopes that the Bibas family may still be alive in captivity - but Israel's prime minister downplays reports, saying list was drawn up by Israel months ago. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A list of Israeli captives in the Gaza Strip published by media outlets Monday has raised hopes among the families of captives that their loved ones may still be alive and up for release in the first phase of a possible ceasefire, while Israel's prime minister dismissed the document Monday. On Sunday, a senior Hamas official told Reuters that the terror group had submitted a list of 34 hostages who may be freed during the first phase of a ceasefire with Israel. A day later, media outlets including the BBC and Saudi Arabia's al-Sharq published the list, which included the names of 10 women, 11 elderly men, two children, and 11 men under 50. The full list included the following names:Romi Gonen (24); Emily Damari (28); Arbel Yehoud (29); Doron Steinbrecher (31); Ariel Bibas (5); Kfir Bibas (1); Shiri Silberman Bibas (33); Liri Albag (19); Karina Ariev (20); Agam Berger (20); Daniel Gilboa (20); Naama Levy (20); Ohad Ben-Ami (55); Gad Moshe Moses (80); Keith Shmuel Siegel (65); Offer Kaldaron (53); Eliyahu Sharabi (52); Itzhak Elgaret (69); Shlomo Mansur (86); Ohad Yahalomi (50); Yousef Yousef Alziadna (54); Oded Lifshitz (84); Tsachi Idan (50); Hisham al-Sayed (36); Yarden Bibas (35); Sagi Dekel Chen (36); Iair Horn (46); Omer Wenkert (23); Alexandre Troufanov (28); Eliya Cohen (27); Or Levy (34); Avera Mengistu (38); Tal Shoham (39); Omer Shem Tov (21). The list included the names of captives Hamas claimed had died in captivity, including members of the Bibas family, three of whom were allegedly killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023. In the past, however, Hamas has falsely claimed captives were killed by Israeli airstrikes, with the claim later being disproven. The inclusion of all four members of the Bibas family, including the father, Yarden, mother, Shiri, and sons Ariel and Kfir, has rekindled hopes Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were not, in fact, killed in November 2023. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downplayed the list, saying Monday that the document was in fact a list drafted by Israel and given to hostage deal brokers in July 2024. 'The list of hostages that has been published in the media was not provided to Israel by Hamas but was originally given by Israel to the mediators in July 2024,' Netanyahu said. 'As yet, Israel has not received any confirmation or comment by Hamas regarding the status of the hostages appearing on the list. Israel will continue to act relentlessly for the return of all of our hostages.' An Israeli source cited by Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, Monday morning said that 'contrary to denials by the Prime Minister's Office, Hamas has submitted a list of hostages to be released, but has not disclosed if any of them are alive.' There are no indications from the list published Monday whether the captives are alive. Hamas has reportedly sought to include dead hostages in the list of 34 captives to be released in the first phase of a ceasefire.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken says White House is pushing for ceasefire and hostage deal to be finalized in next two weeks, amid reports Hamas has handed over list of Israeli hostages. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration is working behind the scenes to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump two weeks from now. Speaking at a press conference in South Korea Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration remains hopeful it can finalize an agreement to free the remaining roughly 100 hostages and bring an end to the fighting in Gaza before the president leaves office. 'We very much want to bring this over the finish line in the next two weeks, the time we have remaining,' Blinken said. 'We have been working intensely to bring this agreement&#8230;that President Biden put forward back in May, and that the entire world got being, country after country&#8230;we're working very hard to bring that over the finish line.' Blinken suggested that recent talks in Doha, Qatar had displayed 'intensified engagement' by negotiators, including Hamas' delegation, potentially signaling that a breakthrough is possible. 'What we've seen in the last couple of weeks is a intensified engagement, including by Hamas. But we have yet to see agreement on the final points,' Blinken continued. 'We will work every minute of every day of those two weeks to try to get that to happen.' 'We want to reach the finish line in the talks for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip within two weeks, and get the hostages out of there.' Israel dispatched Mossad chief David Barnea, who is leading the Israeli negotiating team, back to Doha on Monday for the latest round of talks, after Biden administration envoy Brett McGurk arrived in the Qatari capital.

Iran’s illegal oil exports quadruple under Biden’s watch	Conservative estimates place the value of crude oil and condensate exports at $135 billion during Biden’s term, with an additional $25 billion from fuel oil exports. By Jewish Breaking News A damning investigation by oil tanker tracking firms has exposed the spectacular collapse of Iran sanctions under President Joe Biden, with the Islamic Republic managing to export an astronomical 2 billion barrels of oil during his presidency. Data from commodity intelligence firm Kpler reveals the full scope of Biden’s policy failure. When he took office in January 2021, Iran’s daily oil exports were constrained to under 400,000 barrels, in large part due to Trump’s 'maximum pressure' policy. By last year, that number had exploded to 1.6 million barrels per day. The regime’s sanctions-busting operation has also grown increasingly sophisticated. United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) identified 132 new vessels joining Iran’s 'ghost fleet,' bringing the total number of tankers involved in their illegal enterprise to 477. While UANI’s intelligence led to over 330 flag revocations and helped the U.S. government finally designate 139 vessels for sanctions, it comes as too little, too late, with Iran exporting 587 million barrels in 2024 alone. Conservative estimates place the value of crude oil and condensate exports at $135 billion during Biden’s term, with an additional $25 billion from fuel oil exports. However, experts note to Iran International that steep discounts of $10-30 per barrel are being offered to China which eagerly gobbles up 91% of Iran’s illicit exports. Even more troubling, Iran’s oil revenue flows through an opaque system of cash payments and barter arrangements with China, making it nearly impossible to track how these billions may be funding the regime’s nuclear program and regional terror proxies. Approximately $1 billion worth of oil is being held in China’s Dalian Port. Russia is also helping to prop up the Iranian regime. Last month, President Masoud Pezeshkian met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ashgabat to coordinate support on evading sanctions in the oil, gas, and energy sectors. 'We held talks with the Russian President. They lasted about an hour. We discussed once again the agreements and contracts that we have signed with Russia. We have a constructive interaction. We agreed to speed up the implementation of projects in the fields of gas, road and railway construction, water desalination, and other projects in the fields of energy, petrochemicals, and electricity supply,' Pezeshkian’s press service said in a statement.

Dozens of Gazan terrorists being treated in Israeli hospitals	The move was necessary due to the closure of the hospital in the terrorist detention facility of Sde Teiman. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Dozens of recently captured Gazan terrorists are being treated in Israeli hospitals due to the recent closure of the medical center in the large detention facility at the Sde Teiman military base, Channel 12 reported Sunday. Some 60 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad combatants of the 240 caught in the IDF raid ten days ago on the Kamal Adwan Hospital that had become a terror base in northern Gaza, have been brought to hospitals both near and far. These included Barzilai in Ashkelon and Assuta Ashdod just north of the Strip, as well as Ichilov in Tel Aviv, Wolfson in Holon and Shaare Zedek in Jerusalem, said the report. Among the captured terrorists were those who had participated in the Hamas-led invasion of Israel last October 7 in which 1,200 people were massacred, including women and children. The IDF and Ministry of Health had shut down the southern base’s medical facility in October due to the dwindling number of terrorists needing care. The Health Ministry stated at the time that 'Recently there has been a significant decrease in the volume of activity at the medical facility, due to the change in the activity of the detention facility and the transfer of detainees to other detention facilities. In fact, recently there have been no patients at all at the medical facility.' 'The army and the ministry are making the necessary adjustments to the infrastructure in order to respond according to needs,' the statement added, and later senior ministry officials clarified that 'in the event of renewed intensification of the fighting, the facility will be reactivated.' A Channel 12 report stated then that 'at the peak of the hospital’s activity' it contained 20 prisoners on average. The IDF began bringing those needing treatment to public Israeli hospitals, the report said, where they are guarded by the military police. The move was not without controversy, with a health system source telling the media outlet that 'A dedicated hospitalization facility for terrorists needs to be established' to prevent 'all terrorists' from being treated in Israel. The medical compound in Sde Teiman, the site where up to about a thousand Gazan terrorists have been held at a time after being caught during military operations in the Strip, was established towards the beginning of the war after large numbers of Israelis protested over wounded terrorists being treated in Israeli hospitals alongside injured IDF soldiers and civilians.

Israel gears up to combat lawfare against IDF soldiers abroad	As many as 50 police complaints have been filed, including the one in Brazil where a reservist fled before he was arrested. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An inter-ministry desk has been formed to analyze and combat the danger of legal action against IDF soldiers traveling in foreign countries, Haaretz reported Sunday. The report came after a Brazilian court ordered police Friday to launch an investigation into war crimes allegations against an Israeli tourist for his actions in the Gaza Strip as an IDF soldier. The Israeli foreign ministry warned the soldier about the arrest warrant and he managed to leave the country safely. The joint team from the Military Attorney General's Office, Foreign Ministry, IDF and the Shin Bet internal security service examines the risk to soldiers abroad of having such investigations opened against them, based on complaints filed by pro-Palestinian groups. These groups methodically comb through social media to find posts, videos and pictures that soldiers upload depicting their combat service, in order to use them to accuse the fighters of committing war crimes in Gaza. At least twelve complaints have been filed already, besides the one in Brazil, Channel 12 reported Sunday, in such countries as Belgium, Cyprus, Ireland, the Netherlands, Serbia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Haaretz’s list included France and South Africa. Channel 11 reported that since the beginning of the war, about 50 complaints have been filed against reservists, with 10 being investigated. Israeli officials are reportedly working hard with their foreign counterparts to limit the legal action. In most countries there is no current danger of mass arrests, the outlet said, and no official guidelines have been issued yet prohibiting travel to specific places. If an arrest does occur, the government is preparing to work with local law firms to assist the soldier immediately, Haaretz reported. Israeli officials have also warned travelers to reconsider their trips when they felt they were especially vulnerable, either because they were also citizens of the countries they were going to visit, or if intelligence was received regarding a specific person. Those most at risk would likely be reservists, as the IDF cannot control their visits abroad as they can the movements of conscripts and standing army personnel. The legal danger posed by posting online statements in favor of the war or clips of destroying Hamas-linked buildings in Gaza is a self-inflicted one that both the Foreign Ministry and IDF have warned against. The army seems to have little control over the phenomenon, even though a blanket directive has been given to reduce the soldiers' social media presence. Channel 11 reported that data from the IDF's Information Security Directorate reveals that IDF service members upload about a million items to social media every day.

Ancient monastery uncovered in southern Israel	1,500-year-old Byzantine monastery, featuring mosaic with Greek inscription of a verse from the Book of Deuteronomy, discovered near Kiryat Gat. By World Israel News Staff An ancient Christian monastery, dating back to the Byzantine period, was discovered in southern Israel recently, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced Monday morning. During excavations north of Kiryat Gat, conducted ahead of plans to build a new neighborhood, IAA teams discovered a colorful monastery floor, along with a Greek inscription of a biblical verse. The excavation revealed the remains of at least ten buildings, including the monastery, the winepress and a large warehouse building. The monastery is dated to the Byzantine period (5th-6th centuries CE), and it is part of an ancient site that already existed during the Roman period and continued for approximately 600 years. The findings revealed in the monastery and its environs include a great quantity of imported ware, coins, marble elements, metal and glass vessels, all attesting to the rich and significant community living here. The monastery’s mosaic floor features crosses, lions, doves, an amphora (a ceramic maritime shipping jug), flowers and geometric patterns. In its center, the ancient inscription in Greek was set — 'Blessed are you when you come in, and blessed are you when you go out' (Deuteronomy 28:6). The mosaic’s geometric patterns incorporate very small mosaic stones, which served to highlight the cross-shaped decorations. In addition to the monastery, a very sophisticated wine press was also uncovered, which was built and repaired several times over the years. The mosaic flooring of the fermentation rooms and the collecting vat integrated blue and white stones. In the plastered surfaces of the collecting vats you can see remnants of red paint. The northern collecting vat floor is built of slabs, upon some of which can be still be seen Greek letters, which served as masonry marks for the winepress builders. All of these features indicate that building and developing this winery involved significant financial resources, time, and a range of professional work and effort. According to Shira Lifshitz and Maayan Margulis, excavation managers on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, 'The early settlement is sited on a central road junction connecting the mountain region to the coastal plain.' 'It apparently served the area’s smaller settlements as well as travelers passing by. This is the largest and most significant Roman and Byzantine period site uncovered in this area. The findings indicate a succession of settlement starting from the early Roman period (1st century CE) and through until the end of the Byzantine period (end of the 6th century CE).' The Roman period settlement remains are more limited, but even they display richness in the variety and quality of the finds. In the Byzantine period one can see the settlement’s significant expansion, which included the construction of the monastery and the winepress. In addition, there is much evidence of local pottery production, such as detritus typical of a ceramic factory, garbage pits, misshapen vessels that were flawed in production, and even a number of vessels unique to this site. 'The discovery of the site highlights the historical richness of Kiryat Gat and its surroundings, shedding light on the centrality of the region in antiquity,' said Svetlana Talis, Director of the Southern Region at the Israel Antiquities Authority. 'The mosaic floor will be relocated to an open area in the city and made accessible to the public.' 'The mosaic discovered in Kiryat Gat is one of the most unique ever found in Israel,' adds Mark Avrahami, Head of Artistic Conservation at the Israel Antiquities Authority. 'Transferring mosaics is a complex process that requires great skill and precision. Soon, the ancient mosaic will be moved to the Israel Antiquities Authority's mosaic workshop for preservation before being displayed in the city.'

3 dead in drive-by shooting attack in Samaria	Three people murdered after terrorists open fire on a bus and private cars between the Israeli towns of Kedumim and Karnei Shomron in Samaria. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News At least nine people were wounded, including three fatally, in a shooting attack on a road in Samaria Monday morning. The attack took place when terrorists driving in a passing car opened fire on several Israeli vehicles on Route 55 in central Samaria, near the Palestinian Authority-administered town of Al Funduq, between the Israeli towns of Kedumim and Karnei Shomron. At least four Israeli vehicles were hit by gunfire during the attack, including three private cars and a passenger bus. Immediately after the shooting attack, the terrorists fled the scene in their vehicle. The IDF confirmed the attack, and said that security forces have been dispatched to the scene and that a manhunt has been launched for the perpetrators. 'Following the initial report, terrorists opened fire toward a civilian bus and vehicles adjacent to Al Funduq,' an army spokesperson said. 'As a result of the attack, a number of civilians were injured to varying degrees and are currently receiving medical treatment. Israeli Security Forces are pursuing the terrorists, setting up roadblocks and encircling several towns in the area.' Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah have been called to the scene to treat the victims and evacuate them to hospitals for treatment. According to preliminary reports, a total of nine people were wounded in the attack. Of those, three were initially listed in critical condition, before succumbing to their wounds. They include one man and two women. The six other victims are listed in conditions ranging from serious to light.

‘Jews are damned, have gone astray’ – Syrian school curriculum	The changes, which were posted on the Education Ministry's Facebook page, sparked near-instant backlash. By World Israel News Staff Changes made by Syria's new government the country's school curriculum have raised serious concerns, after lesson plans were edited to include messages condemning those who do not follow Islam. Islamist rebels recently ousted longtime leader Bashar al-Assad, who had long promoted secularism in the country and within its institutions, in a flash offensive. The current caretaker leader of Syria, Ahmad Al-Sharaa, who was previously affiliated with Al-Qaeda, has repeatedly claimed that Syria will grant full rights to all of its citizens, regardless of their faith. But changes to lesson plans posted online suggested that Syria's education system is currently undergoing an Islamic revamp. Lessons about evolution and the origins of life have been entirely removed from the curriculum, CNN reported. A document specifying edits to lesson plans showed language changed in a way that clearly states non-Muslims are misguided. The phrase 'path of goodness' was changed to 'Islamic path,' and 'those who have are damned and have gone astray' to 'Jews and Christians.' The changes, which were posted on the Education Ministry's Facebook page, sparked near-instant backlash. 'The current government is a caretaker government that does not have the right to make these amendments to the curricula,' one Syrian wrote in response on the ministry’s Facebook post. 'The curricula must be amended in accordance with the new constitution.' Another Syrian commented, 'How long does it take to write a constitution? [The Islamic rebel groups] are telling us three to four years. Time it takes to change the national curriculum? Three hours. What a farce.' In a statement, Education Minister Nazir Mohammad al-Qadri downplayed the changes.

Lebanon: IDF troops on territory are ‘danger to regional stabilit...	If the IDF remains in Lebanon past the 60-day deadline, there will be 'serious problems,' warns Lebanese official. By World Israel News Staff The Lebanese government is concerned by the likelihood that Israeli troops will remain on the ground in the country after the 60-day ceasefire expires at the end of January, despite a stipulation in the truce requiring the IDF to withdraw from the region. Israel has repeatedly signaled in recent days that it will probably maintain a troop presence in southern Lebanon for the foreseeable future, as the Lebanese Army has failed to drive Hezbollah operatives north of the Litani River and the terror organization appears to be regrouping in the area. Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati is currently attempting to garner international support to pressure Israel to withdraw, a source told Saudi outlet Asharq Al-Awsat. Mikati is warning that a continued IDF presence in southern Lebanon constitutes a 'danger to regional stability,' the source said. Since the implementation of the ceasefire in late November, Israel has continued carrying out airstrikes against threats, such as Hezbollah operatives and infrastructure in areas near the border. A Lebanese official complained to Arabic-language newspaper Al-Diyar that Jerusalem's continued military activity in southern Lebanon is tantamount to 'continuing the war as though the truce hadn't been signed.' The official added that if Israeli troops remain on Lebanese soil past the 60-day deadline, 'there will be serious complications and serious problems.' During a tour of the northern border on Sunday, Defense Minister Israel Katz stressed that Israel would continue to act in order to protect its national security. 'If Hezbollah does not withdraw beyond the Litani River, there will be no ceasefire, and Israel will act on its own to ensure the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes,' Katz said. He added that 'we will not allow a renewed threat to be created against the northern communities and the citizens of the State of Israel.'

Hamas claims it provided a list of 34 hostages, Israel denies it	The Hamas source also told Reuters that any hostage release deal is contingent on Israel withdrawing its troops from Gaza. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas told Reuters that it has provided a list of 34 hostages, but Israel has denied the claim. The Hamas source also told Reuters that any hostage release deal is contingent on Israel withdrawing its troops from Gaza. Israel has denied this report that Hamas has given a list of 34 hostages. As of now, Hamas has not given a list of hostages,' says the Prime Minister's Office in a statement. Channel 12 reported that Hamas did show a list of hostages, but did not indicate who on the list was still alive. Previously, it was reported that Israel gave Hamas a list of 34 hostages it wanted to be released in the first phase of a hostage release and prisoner exchange deal. However, Hamas agreed to release only 22, including elderly and female hostages, and refused to release any men of military age Israel had demanded. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said that Israel will not commit to a complete end of the war and a withdrawal of IDF soldiers at the outset, but has agreed to a phased deal with a temporary pause in fighting to allow the release of hostages. Last week, Netanyahu said The Hamas terror organization is not taking hostage deal and ceasefire talks in Doha, Qatar seriously and 'does not want' to reach an agreement. Hamas 'does not want there to be a deal,' Netanyahu said, according to a report by The Jerusalem Post. In an interview with The New York Times, outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken denied Netanyahu was responsible for the impasse in a hostage agreement. He said he was 'astonished' the world wasn't putting more pressure on Hamas. 'One of the things that I found a little astounding … you hear virtually nothing from anyone since Oct. 7 about Hamas.' He added, 'Why there hasn't been a unanimous chorus around the world for Hamas to put down its weapons, to give up the hostages, to surrender — I don't know what the answer is to that. Israel, on various occasions has offered safe passage to Hamas's leadership and fighters out of Gaza. Where is the world?'

Blinken: World pressure on Israel caused Hamas to reject hostage ...	Blinken said he believed Hamas wanted to forestall a hostage and ceasefire deal to expand the conflict from Israel and Gaza to Iran and its terror proxy groups. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told The New York Times that world pressure on Israel harmed hostage release deals and encouraged Hamas to repeatedly reject them while laying the blame at Israel's feet. Blinken described how public international pressure on Israel motivated Hamas to back off from hostage deals. 'Whenever there has been public daylight between the United States and Israel and the perception that pressure was growing on Israel, we've seen it: Hamas has pulled back from agreeing to a ceasefire and the release of hostages.' Blinken said he believed Hamas wanted to forestall a hostage and ceasefire deal to expand the conflict from Israel and Gaza to Iran and its terror proxy groups. Blinken said, 'Hamas, when they saw Israel under pressure publicly, they pulled back. The other thing that got Hamas to pull back was their belief, their hope that there would be a wider conflict, that Hezbollah would attack Israel, that Iran would attack Israel, that other actors would attack Israel, and that Israel would have its hands full. Hamas could continue what it was doing. So we've worked very hard to make sure that that didn't happen.' When the New York Times interviewer alleged that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created obstacles to a hostage release deal in July, Blinken refuted the claim and defended Netanyahu. Blinken said, 'What we've seen time and again is Hamas not concluding a deal that it should have concluded. There have been times when actions that Israel has taken have, yes, made it more difficult. But there's been a rationale for those actions.' The outgoing Secretary of State said it was 'astounding' that world opinion focused on blaming Israel for the lack of a hostage agreement and ceasefire rather than Hamas. Blinken explained, 'One of the things that I found a little astounding &#8230; you hear virtually nothing from anyone since Oct. 7 about Hamas.' He added, 'Why there hasn't been a unanimous chorus around the world for Hamas to put down its weapons, to give up the hostages, to surrender — I don't know what the answer is to that.

Dahoah-Halevy stated that had this information been detected, analyzed, and processed by Israeli intelligence, the IDF might have been more prepared to respond to the Hamas attack. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A Middle Eastern Affairs researcher has pointed out that hours before the invasion and massacre on October 7th, 2023, Hamas posted on Telegram warnings about the impending attack. Lt. Col. (res.) Jonathan Dahoah-Halevi, a senior researcher on Middle East affairs and radical Islam at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, published the report. The report revealed that detailed information about the attacks was posted prior to October 7th on the Telegram channel 'Military Tactics' connected with the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military force of Hamas. Dahoah-Halevy stated that had this information been detected, analyzed, and processed by Israeli intelligence, the IDF might have been more prepared to respond to the Hamas attack. One of the messages sent shortly after midnight said, 'The 5,12 people of the dawn are the people of Allah.' This may seem on the surface to be an encouragement to wake early and pray, but Dahoah-Halevy explains that the time 5:12 is a hint that their followers should be ready not only to pray to Allah but to attack Israel. A second message posted at 00:22 said, 'We say to the Zionist enemy, no one has previously experienced the [operation] that will come to you.' A few seconds later, another post said, 'There are many, many, many, many, many surprises.' Other messages sent throughout the night and in the early morning hours said, 'We swear by Allah, we will humiliate you and annihilate you completely, and you will suffer in the next stages, you and your faint-hearted settlers.' It continued: 'The pure guns are ready, and your heads are the target.' 'We will fight you in all [fighting] arenas, and the Al-Qassam Brigades [Hamas] and the Al-Quds Brigades [Islamic Jihad] will boom with the thunder of gunfire and explosions in every [fighting] arena. The media chatter endlessly about the number of dead and seriously wounded among the enemy.' 'Your attacks against the Al-Aqsa [Mosque] recently will be redoubled on you with fire and flames,' it added. 'You have been warned. What is about to happen will be a massive [event].' The Telegram channel also posted warnings as early as September 17th, threatening Israels living in the Gaza envelope. One message said, 'No one will be able to give you the security you dream of. Soon, you will witness the blood of your soldiers staining the fangs of our lions. A major security incident is coming, and it will be soon.'

Iran armed the Houthis for ‘years’ of attacks against Israel	Some experts suggest the only path to neutralizing the Houthi threat lies in eliminating its leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. By Jewish Breaking News With Hamas and Hezbollah taking heavy losses from Israeli forces, Iran has begun funneling more weapons to its Houthi terror proxy. As part of its global jihad, the Islamic Republic has provided the Houthis with enough military supplies to sustain attacks on Israel and international shipping routes for 'years to come,' Yemen’s military spokesman Abdul Basit Al-Baher tells The Telegraph. 'This is clear evidence that Iran is increasing its support for the Houthis after the weakening of Hamas and Hezbollah and the fall of the Assad regime in the region,' he said, noting the Houthis have received from Iran 'high-level missiles and aircraft' alongside 'workshops for assembling and manufacturing drones and developing missiles.' In spite of fierce Israeli bombardment and joint U.S.-British strikes against their weapons facilities, Houthi terrorists managed to launch their sixth missile attack on Israel last Thursday in a span of less than two weeks. The Houthis currently control territory containing roughly 80 percent of Yemen’s population, presenting a formidable challenge for Israel’s intelligence gathering. Coupled with distance and lack of a shared border, the IDF is reportedly relying on allied tribal sources and the Yemeni government for intelligence information. Israeli security sources, who previously dismissed the Houthis as a regional nuisance, now acknowledge being caught flat-footed. 'All the time, we were under the conception that the Houthis weren’t an Israeli problem, more for the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE,' one intelligence source admitted. 'They don’t have the capacity of Hezbollah, but still, they have their own production. Some of that was hit by the US-UK attacks but not all of it, and it’s scattered around Yemen so it’s not easy to locate or tackle as it’s not in one place,' he said. 'But I don’t see this being able to continue for years.' Some experts suggest the only path to neutralizing the Houthi threat lies in eliminating its leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. 'The Houthis’ whole regime is one Shiite tribe which relies on its megalomaniac leader, and if Israel and the allies eliminate Abdul-Malik and his brother, the whole regime will collapse,' another Israeli security source tells The Telegraph. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s return to office is expected to trigger intensified strikes against the Houthis, particularly given Trump’s pledge to reapply 'maximum pressure' against Iran and their terror proxies throughout the Middle East.

High Court: Israel can retain bodies of slain terrorists for pote...	Justice David Mintz emphasized the court’s limited authority to intervene in security-related government decisions, noting intervention is reserved for extreme circumstances. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s High Court of Justice unanimously ruled on Sunday that the state is not obligated to release for burial the bodies of slain terrorists who were Israeli citizens. The decision upheld the state’s position that retaining these bodies may be necessary for potential negotiations to secure the return of Israeli hostages and deceased individuals held by Hamas in Gaza. The ruling followed six petitions filed last year by relatives of the deceased. The petitioners argued the policy was unlawful, exceeded legal authority, and inflicted significant harm on the dignity of both the deceased and their families. The state contended that negotiations for hostages and the dead are in a sensitive and dynamic phase. It maintained that retaining the bodies remains a critical option for advancing these talks. Justice David Mintz, writing for the three-judge panel, emphasized the court’s limited authority to intervene in security-related government decisions, noting intervention is reserved for extreme circumstances. He further cited a 1945 regulation granting the military commander authority to withhold the release of terrorist bodies, a power affirmed by a prior court ruling to apply to Israeli citizens. Mintz concluded that the government’s decision is a temporary measure subject to ongoing cabinet review. Given the current security landscape and the evolving nature of negotiations, the court found no grounds for interference.

Israeli embassy original target in Taylor Swift terror plot	The plot’s discovery triggered one of 2024’s largest counter-terrorism investigations, involving intelligence and law enforcement agencies from at least six countries, the Post reported. By Erez Linn, JNS In a chilling revelation of threats facing Israeli diplomatic missions, a 19-year-old ISIS supporter considered attacking the Israeli embassy in Vienna before planning to target a Taylor Swift concert, The Washington Post reported on Sunday. The case highlights security concerns for Israeli interests in Europe. Before settling on the concert venue as his target, Beran Aliji, a dual citizen of Austria and North Macedonia, had carefully evaluated other high-profile locations, including the Israeli embassy, Kurdish diplomats and a Shi’ite mosque, according to police records obtained by the newspaper. The discovery prompted heightened security measures at Israeli diplomatic facilities across Europe, as investigators uncovered evidence of Aliji’s extensive consumption of terrorist propaganda and his pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State. By July, amid what he described as a mental-health crisis, the Austrian teenager quit his factory apprenticeship and isolated himself in his apartment, becoming obsessed with thoughts of death, he later told police. Without money or prospects, and lacking close friendships, he immersed himself in violent videos and secret chatrooms devoted to the Islamic State. 'These are bitter, angry people,' Bruce Riedel, a counter-terrorism expert and 30-year veteran of the CIA, said. The case reflects a broader pattern of self-radicalization that concerns Israeli and Western security officials. The investigation revealed hundreds of text messages and multiple police reports showing how Aliji sought guidance from individuals he believed to be Islamic State members. 'My operation is to take place at a big concert,' he wrote in one message, according to Austrian records. 'I will try to get a gun and bombs. If that doesn’t work, I will use big knives. Or I will kill a police officer and take his rifle.' The plot’s discovery triggered one of 2024’s largest counter-terrorism investigations, involving intelligence and law enforcement agencies from at least six countries, the Post reported. While initial speculation connected the plot to tensions surrounding Gaza, investigators found it stemmed from personal instability and online radicalization. A senior European counterterrorism official, speaking anonymously due to the sensitive nature of ongoing investigations, noted that the ranks of the radicalized are growing 'younger and younger.' The official expressed particular concern about children watching execution videos and following extremist influencers at an early age. Islamic State and Al-Qaeda Unable to secure weapons due to financial constraints, Aliji tried to manufacture explosives in his apartment. He managed to produce only a small amount of triacetone triperoxide (TATP), which experts later determined was insufficient to cause serious damage. Police discovered dozens of Islamic State and Al-Qaeda propaganda videos on Aliji’s phone, including beheading recordings. His school reported concerning behavior during his final year, with staff noting misogynistic and antisocial tendencies that made them fear he was becoming 'extremely dangerous.' The investigation intensified after Aliji sought direct guidance from someone he believed to be an Islamic State official known as 'Abu Omar.' These communications were monitored by intelligence agencies, leading to the CIA helping alert Austrian authorities to the plot. Austrian SWAT teams stormed Aliji’s apartment on Aug. 7, after evacuating nearby homes due to concerns about explosives. His 17-year-old friend, a male Austrian citizen of Turkish and Croatian descent who worked for the concert’s security company, was arrested the same day. Werner Tomanek, Aliji’s Viennese lawyer, declined to comment beyond noting that there were 'no official accusations, but only a working hypothesis of the public prosecutor’s office.' Rita Katz, founder of SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist online activity, said, 'ISIS is still very relevant, especially for the young generation. You can find them online more easily than a few years ago.' The Taylor Swift concerts were subsequently canceled, with her later expressing gratitude to law enforcement on Instagram for preventing tragedy. 'Thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives,' Swift wrote.

Jerusalem terror attack: Arab janitor strangled, stabbed Israeli ...	Israeli investigators say attempted murder of Israeli woman by an east Jerusalem janitor was a terror attack. By World Israel News Staff A violent assault on an elderly Israeli woman in her apartment in central Jerusalem was a nationalistically-motivated terror attack, Israeli authorities declared Sunday. On Sunday afternoon, Israeli police and the Shin Bet internal security agency released a joint statement declaring that the attempted murder of a 74-year-old Jerusalem woman by an Arab janitor was a terror attack, not a mere armed robbery. The attack occurred on December 19th, when the suspect, a 60-year-old resident of east Jerusalem arrived at the home of his victim, ostensibly to do cleaning and maintenance work. The suspect, from Jerusalem's Silwan neighborhood, worked as the janitor for the apartment building where the victim lived. He had performed work for the victim in the past, and was supposed to finish repairs in her apartment when he arrived there on December 19th. Rather than complete his work, however, the suspect strangled the woman, attempting to murder her. He then left the apartment, before returning shortly thereafter, when he realized he had forgotten his walking stick in her apartment. Upon his arrival, the terrorist discovered that his victim had not died in the attack. He found a knife in a drawer in the victim's apartment and stabbed her repeatedly, with the intention of murdering her. Believing the woman to be fatally injured, he stole her jewelry and left her apartment. The victim, despite her wounds, was able to call her daughter for assistance. Meanwhile the terrorist sold the stolen goods at an east Jerusalem pawn shop and fled to Samaria. Within hours, Israeli authorities located the terrorist and arrested him During his interrogation, investigators ascertained that the suspect had attempted to murder the woman on nationalistic grounds, over his anger regarding the war in Gaza, rather than as part of a planned robbery. The terrorist was brought before a Jerusalem court Sunday for an extension of his detention, pending the filing of an indictment against him later this week.

Islamist party offers to back Netanyahu government	The United Arab List, affiliated with the Southern Islamic Movement, offers to give Netanyahu a 'safety net' in the Knesset if the prime minister's right-wing allies balk at a ceasefire deal with Hamas. By World Israel News Staff An Arab-Israeli party aligned with a controversial Islamist movement has offered to support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government in the Knesset, should Netanyahu face opposition from some of his coalition allies over a possible ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas. Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, who lead the Religious Zionist Party and Otzma Yehudit factions, have expressed opposition to any deal with Hamas that would include major concessions, such as the freeing of prominent jailed Palestinian terrorists, an IDF withdrawal from most of the Gaza Strip, and a permanent end to the war in the Gaza Strip. On Saturday night, MK Mansour Abbas, chairman of the United Arab List (Ra'am) told Israel's Channel 12 that his party's five Knesset members could provide Netanyahu with a parliamentary 'safety net' should Ben-Gvir and Smotrich attempt to either topple the government or block passage of a hostage deal in the Knesset. 'The Zionist parties, led by Benny Gantz, can take such steps. If a government comes that will bring them home and stop the war – the United Arab List will provide a safety net,' Abbas said. While Abbas criticized the current government, calling it 'bad,' he emphasized his support for any effort to secure a hostage deal and an end to the war in Gaza. Abbas also rejected calls for early elections, saying the country needs political stability, suggesting that opposition leaders could form a new unity government with Netanyahu 'that will complete the term, bring back the hostages, stop the war, rehabilitate the south and the north, and also address the issue of crime in Arab society.' 'It is very sad that we are entering 2025 with the hostages still held captive in the Gaza Strip. The composition of this government will not bring back the hostages, and therefore a different government composition is needed.'

IDF soldier, survivor of Oct 7th massacre, flees Brazil ahead of ...	Israeli man targeted in war crimes probe in Brazil manages to flee the country prior to opening of criminal investigation. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News An Israeli tourist who has been targeted by a war crimes probe while visiting Brazil has managed to leave the country before the formal opening of the investigation, crossing the border to ensure he avoids detention abroad, Brazilian media outlets reported over the weekend. On Friday, the Federal Court for Brazil's Federal District ordered police to launch an investigation into war crimes allegations against an Israeli tourist visiting the country on a tourist visa, over his actions in the Gaza Strip as an IDF soldier. The probe was initiated in response to a petition by the Hind Rajab Foundation, an anti-Israel Brussels-based organization which lobbies foreign governments and law enforcement agencies to take action against Israeli officials and IDF soldiers. The foundation accused the soldier in question of taking part in demolition operations in the Gaza Strip during the ongoing war against Hamas. The Israeli foreign ministry warned the soldier and a traveling companion that Brazilian authorities had issued a warrant for his arrest. Early Sunday morning the soldier notified his father that he had left the country, the soldier's father told Israel's Channel 12. 'I asked them to escape immediately and not stay even a moment longer,' he said. 'I believe they’ll find their way home safely, but we need to make sure they know the truth about the soldier. He’s not a suspect; he’s a soldier who’s been through hell.' The soldier has been identified as a survivor of the Nova Music Festival massacre at Re'im, the largest of the October 7th, 2023 massacres. A total of 364 people were murdered during the attack on the festival, with hundreds wounded and dozens taken hostage. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid condemned the investigation against the soldier, while also accusing the Israeli government of failing to protect IDF soldiers abroad. 'The fact that an Israeli reservist was forced to flee Brazil in the dead of night to avoid being arrested for fighting in Gaza is a huge political failure by an irresponsible government that simply doesn't know how to function,' Lapid tweeted. 'How did we get to the point where the Palestinians are better than the Israeli government in the international arena?'

Trump administration plans crippling sanctions on ICC	The incoming administration’s strategy extends beyond unilateral actions, as it plans to secure commitments from U.S. allies to reject cooperation with arrest warrants targeting Israeli officials. By Ariel Kahana, JNS President-elect Donald Trump plans to implement devastating sanctions against the International Criminal Court in The Hague immediately after taking office, sources close to the matter disclosed to Israel Hayom. These executive orders could be unveiled as soon as Jan. 21. The sanctions package will target both individual ICC personnel, including judges and prosecutors, and the institution as a whole. The administration intends to classify the ICC as an organization threatening U.S. interests, employing designation procedures similar to those used by the State Department for terrorist organizations globally. This designation will trigger severe restrictions on anyone involved with the court’s operations. Financial institutions worldwide will be required to terminate relationships with ICC personnel or face U.S. sanctions themselves. Mirroring actions taken against sanctioned Israeli citizens by the outgoing administration, ICC staff will find themselves unable to perform routine banking operations or use credit cards. Their financial activities will be effectively frozen, with exceptions only for essential needs such as food purchases. Furthermore, all U.S.-based assets belonging to ICC employees and the institution will be frozen. The incoming administration’s strategy extends beyond unilateral actions, as it plans to secure commitments from U.S. allies to reject cooperation with arrest warrants targeting Israeli officials. These measures aim to create conditions allowing the court to independently withdraw its arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Officials hope that during appeal proceedings, either Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan or the judges will identify legal grounds to rescind these warrants. The incoming administration considers the ICC’s arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant a direct threat to U.S. national security. The incoming officials believe these actions ultimately seek to strip the U.S. and its allies of their ability to mount military defenses against global threats. Trump administration officials and Republican senators widely view Israel’s situation as a precedent, believing the U.S. could face similar warrants next, leading them to treat these actions against Israeli officials as precursors to targeting American leadership and military command. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who will lead the Senate Intelligence Committee starting this week, said that 'the ICC is a ‘kangaroo court’ and Karim Khan is a deranged zealot. Woe to him and anyone who tries to enforce these lawless warrants. Let me give everyone a friendly reminder: The U.S. law on ICC is known as the ‘Hague Invasion Act,’ and there’s a reason for that. Think about it.'

Israeli forces uncover weapons in Syrian demilitarized zone	Israel sent forces into the 235 sq km buffer zone to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border when the regime of Bashar Assad collapsed in December. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli soldiers on the Syrian side of a strategic peak in the demilitarized zone discovered a 'significant cache' of weapons, the Israel Defense Forces said on Sunday. The IDF’s 'Mountain Brigade' discovered military structures and control points on the Syrian side of Mount Hermon, the highest peak in the Golan Heights. Troops uncovered and neutralized what the army said was a 'significant cache of weapons and intelligence assets,' including rockets, launchers, anti-tank missiles, mines and explosive charges. Israel sent forces into the 235 sq km buffer zone to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border when the regime of Bashar Assad collapsed in December. The move into the demilitarized zone was coordinated with peacekeepers from the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF). Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar met with UNDOF commanders on Thursday. Israeli officials say they will remain in the demilitarized zone for as long as necessary. While Israeli forces have briefly entered the buffer zone in the past, December’s takeover marked the first time since its establishment that the IDF set up positions there. The demilitarized zone was established with a ceasefire in 1974 that ended the Yom Kippur War. Israel considers the 1974 ceasefire agreement void until order is restored in Syria.

Congress is notified by the Biden administration of a planned $8 ...	The weapons package would add to a record of at least $17.9 billion in military aid that the U.S. has provided Israel. By The Associated Press The State Department has informed Congress of a planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel, U.S. officials say, as the American ally presses forward with its war against Hamas in Gaza. Some of the arms in the package could be sent through current U.S. stocks but the majority would take a year or several years to deliver, according to two U.S. officials Saturday who spoke on condition of anonymity because the notification to Congress hasn’t been formally sent. The sale includes medium-range air-to-air missiles to help Israel defend against airborne threats, 155 mm projectile artillery shells for long-range targeting, Hellfire AGM-114 missiles, 500-pound bombs and more. The weapons package would add to a record of at least $17.9 billion in military aid that the U.S. has provided Israel since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, launched the war. There have been unsuccessful efforts in Congress by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and some Democrats to block sales of offensive weapons to Israel. The United States paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in May to force the Jewish nation not to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The Biden administration has demanded that Israel increase humanitarian aid into the enclave. But in November, citing some limited progress, it declined to limit arms transfers as it threatened to do if the situation did not improve. The Israeli army said Friday that it had struck dozens of Hamas gathering points and command centers throughout Gaza. Israel’s military says it only targets terrorists and Howdy, Yossi Lichtblames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Winter has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near the sea. The informal notice to Congress isn’t the final notification before a sale. Now the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can review the package. News of the weapons sale was first reported by Axios.

IDF downs Houthi missile fired from Yemen	Houthi terrorists have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since Oct. 7, 2023. By JNS The Israeli Air Force intercepted a missile fired by Houthi terrorists in Yemen overnight Saturday. The projectile was shot down before entering Israeli airspace, the IDF said. Air-raid sirens sounded in Moshav Talmei Elazar, located east of Hadera and southeast of Caesarea, but not throughout the central region as was the case in several other recent attacks. document.createElement('video'); The IDF overnight Thursday downed a Houthi missile that triggered air-raid sirens across the country, including in Jerusalem, the greater Tel Aviv area and parts of Judea. Flights in and out of Ben-Gurion International Airport were halted for about 30 minutes due to that attack, with two planes diverting to Larnaca in Cyprus. Hours later, the military said that the Air Force had intercepted a drone launched from Yemen. Houthi terrorists have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the terrorist invasion of the northwestern Negev on Oct. 7, 2023. On Dec. 26, the Israeli Air Force conducted strikes on the western coast of and deep inside Yemen, including at Sanaa International Airport in the Houthi-controlled capital. The targets included the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations, in addition to terrorist infrastructure in the Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports. 'These military targets were used by the Houthi terrorist regime to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials. This is a further example of the Houthis’ exploitation of civilian infrastructure for military purposes,' the IDF said.

Israelis injured in New Orleans attack ID’d as reservists vacatio...	The pair of friends had gone traveling to 'clear their heads' and have fun in the U.S. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The two Israelis who were injured in the New Orleans terror attack last week were a pair of reservists who had battled Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists for most of the war and had gone on a trip afterward to 'clear their heads,' The New York Post reported Saturday. Israel’s consul general the Southwest United States, Elad Shoshan told the paper that the pair were 'best friends' in their mid-to-late twenties who had served for over a year and were traveling for fun after their stressful service. 'They came here to relax, to travel. Now that interrupted in the most horrific way,' Shoshan said, calling it a 'tragic irony' that they had been hurt on holiday and not while doing battle. 'They left the terror of one country and never expected to be victims of it in another,' he told the paper. One is still in serious condition, having suffered head trauma that has already required two 'life-saving' operations, the consul general said. He will need more surgeries for other injuries as well. 'He’s in severe pain all over his body,' said Shoshan, who flew to the hospital from his base in Houston, Texas to offer any official help he could immediately after it became known that Israelis had been hurt. The second man is in moderate but stable condition, having undergone two operations for internal injuries. Shoshan described how the man emotionally said the Shema prayer for his critically injured friend’s full recovery. New Orleans had been the reservists’ second to-last stop of their six-week visit before returning to Israel. Their families, who flew from Israel to be at their sides, prefer that their names be withheld at this time. They are being warmly supported by the local Jewish community, which is some 12,000 strong. 'The road ahead will be challenging, but we remain optimistic and remain hopeful for their speedy recovery,' the father of the severely injured Israeli told the paper. The two men had been partying on the streets of the city’s historic French Quarter early Wednesday morning, celebrating New Year’s Eve along with hundreds of others when Texan Shamsud-Din Jabbar rammed a rented pick-up truck into the revelers. He then got out and started shooting people, murdering 14 and injuring some 30 others in total, including at least two police officers, before being killed by their colleagues. An FBI investigation found that the former IT specialist for the American army, who served for almost a year in Afghanistan, had booked the truck rental in mid-November, suggesting that he had been planning the attack for at least six weeks. On Friday, the federal agency said that two improvised explosive devices had also been planted in coolers in the area of the historic French Quarter where the ramming took place, and the transmitter to detonate them were found in Jabbar’s truck. Bomb-making materials were also found in the nearby Airbnb home he had rented and had tried to burn down unsuccessfully before setting out on his killing spree. Jabbar had posted videos online saying that he had joined the ISIS terror organization, and during a search of his Houston home, the authorities found a Quran open to a verse about martyrdom. Shoshan said that Israel and the U.S. are fighting 'the same ideology, the same enemy,' equating ISIS with Hamas, both of which are Muslim extremist groups, as the IDF continues to battle Hamas after its terrorists led an invasion and massacre of 1,200 last October 7.

Israeli military preparing for ‘extreme’ Iranian attack – report	IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi reportedly placing Israeli military on high alert, amid intelligence suggesting Iran planning 'extreme' attack on Israel ahead of President-elect Trump's inauguration later this month. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military has been placed on high alert and is preparing to respond to possible 'extreme' steps by Iran against the Jewish state in the immediate future, according to a report by the Israeli media outlet Walla. According to the report, which cited Israeli defense officials, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi has instructed top brass to draft plans to respond to various possible Iranian attacks on Israel, amid fears Tehran may attempt to carry out a major assault in a matter of days, ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20th. The IDF is reportedly concerned that given Iran's increasingly tenuous position - including a major economic downturn, energy shortages, popular dissent, and the prospect of a fresh wave of sanctions from the incoming Trump administration - Tehran may act out of desperation to shore up the positions of its proxies across the Middle East. Iran and its allies suffered devastating losses across the region during 2024, including not only the decimation of Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip, but also the destruction of much of Hezbollah's leadership and the dismantling of the organization's infrastructure in southern Lebanon, severe damage to Iran's air defense network, and the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Given these setbacks, some Israeli defense officials believe Iran could lash out at the Jewish state with 'extreme' measures. Israeli and American leaders are also preparing for an attempt by Iran to rush towards a nuclear breakout prior to Trump's inauguration. Last week, Axios reported that U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had briefed President Joe Biden on possible options for airstrikes against Iran's nuclear program, should the U.S. detect a sudden movement towards 90% uranium enrichment.

‘Christians are essential in fight against antisemitism,’ says Is...	Israel's war against Hamas is part of a larger 'clash of civilizations' between 'barbarians' and 'the free world,' says Israeli ambassador to the US, adding that 'the American people clearly stand with Israel.' By World Israel News Staff In one of his final speeches as Israel’s Ambassador to the U.S., Michael Herzog addressed hundreds of Christian students who had traveled from across North America to Washington, D.C., for a weekend of Israel advocacy organized in partnership between Inspire and Passages. Known as the 'Christian Birthright,' Passages was founded in 2016 and has since brought over 11,000 Christian students from North America to Israel for the first time. The initiative aims to strengthen religious identity and foster friendship with Israel and the Jewish people. Inspire creates digital resources and immersive experiences designed to make Bible reading simple, enjoyable and transformational for people of all ages. 'Despite all the noise and protests, after 15 months of war, my conclusion is clear: the American people stand with us,' said Ambassador Herzog. 'They understand right from wrong and recognize what is at stake. We have witnessed unprecedented political and diplomatic support from both sides of Congress, especially in combating the blood libels at the ICJ and ICC.' 'When tested, the U.S. and Israel stand united,' he continued. 'I have high expectations for continued cooperation with the incoming administration. There are two major opportunities ahead: First, pushing back against the Iranian nuclear program, which poses a grave threat to Israel, the region, the U.S., and the free world. This should begin with sanctions, but must also include a credible military option. Second, there is an opportunity to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. I believe the door is open, and this could be a game-changer.' The event took place at Museum of the Bible, where Ambassador Herzog and his wife Shirin Herzog were presented with a remarkable gift – a copy of the Afghan Liturgical Quire, the oldest Hebrew book in the world. This medieval manuscript, dating back to the 8th century, includes prayers, poems, and the oldest known Passover Haggadah. The gift was presented by Jackie & Steve Green, Co-Founder & Chairman of Museum of the Bible. 'The Afghan Liturgical Quire is one of the most cherished treasures in the museum’s collection, and it speaks to the Jewish people’s continuity, resilience and excellence,' said Green while presenting the gift to Ambassador Herzog. 'We all know that it has not been easy for you Ambassador, but you leave your position knowing that the U.S. – Israel relationship is stronger and more resilient than ever. It has withstood testing times, but Israel knows that the foundation of this special relationship is supported by the majority of Americans at all levels of society, from the people to the president and the president-elect.' 'Our Christian friends are essential in the fight against antisemitism,' Ambassador Herzog told the Christian students advocating for Israel on their campuses. 'Your advocacy, rooted in faith and the love of life, is crucial in this battle. We value life, while our enemies value death. We focus on the future, while they seek to revive the dark past.' 'This is a clash of civilizations,' he added. 'What the barbarians did to our people on October 7th cannot be explained merely in political terms. There is a deeper element to this. Our partnership with the Christian community is vital in confronting this type of war. When Israel fights its enemies, it is a battle for the free world. Our victory will be a victory for the free world. We are in this together.' The trip to DC is a stepping stone for the students to an Israel trip with Passages. They will visit Museum of the Bible, the Holocaust Memorial museum, and hear from Israeli tour guides. To close the weekend, the students will put together hundreds of 'Kits for Kids' to send to Israel for children who are forced to spend time in bomb shelters. 'Now, more than ever, we are seeing our Christian friends step up, whether by visiting Israel to show solidarity or by standing with Jewish students on North American campuses,' said Rivka Kidron, Co-Founder of Passages and former Advisor to Israel’s Prime Minister. 'Passages is working harder than ever to combat the delegitimization of the Jewish state on university campuses. As Ambassador Herzog said, when Jews and Christians stand together, we will defeat our shared enemies.' In addition to the advocacy weekend in Washington, Passages resumed its student trips to Israel, including visits to communities near the Gaza border and volunteering with those most affected by the war in northern and southern Israel.

‘An Israeli attack could spark full-scale war’ – Iranian official	After ongoing Iranian aggression, official says he hopes that 'Israel will refrain from taking reckless action.' By World Israel News Staff A senior Iranian official warned that an additional attack by Israel on its territory could trigger a 'large-scale war,' during an interview with a Chinese state-controlled news agency. 'We are fully prepared for the possibility of further Israeli attacks,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CCTV. 'I hope Israel will refrain from taking such reckless action, as it could lead to a large-scale war.' He added that Iran 'believes that reason will ultimately prevail and prevent actions that could have serious consequences.' Araghchi made the remarks in late December, while on a diplomatic visit to China, but the interview was only published on Saturday. During the visit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed his opposition to international sanctions against Iran. China, a close ally of Iran, is a critical trading partner for the country. In 2024, 91% of Iran's total exports of its sanctioned crude oil, condensates, and fuel oil went to China. Araghchi's comments came after tensions between Israel and Iran reached historic highs in 2024. In April, following the assassination of a senior IRGC commander by the IDF, Iran launched an unprecedented attack on the Jewish State. Tehran launched some 300 explosive drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted by an American-led coalition outside of Israeli airspace. A seven-year-old Bedouin-Israeli girl was severely wounded by falling shrapnel. There were no other casualties in the attack, and Israel did not respond. However, in October, Iran launched another massive missile barrage, sending virtually all of Israel's residents into bomb shelters. That attack saw a Palestinian civilian in Jericho killed by falling shrapnel. Weeks later, Israel destroyed Iran's air defense systems and UAV and missile production facilities. Four Iranian soldiers and a security guard were killed in the Israeli bombardment.

Hezbollah threatens Israel – ‘Our patience is running out’	Our patience may run out before or after the 60 days, when we decide to do something that you will see directly,' says Hezbollah chief Qassem Naim. By World Israel News Staff Hezbollah head Naim Qassem threatened that the terror group will resume hostilities against Israel during a speech on Saturday evening. Qassem, who replaced slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in late October 2024, spoke about the ongoing ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. The 60-day truce is set to expire in late January, days after incoming president-elect Donald Trump assumes office. 'There is no timetable that specifies the resistance’s work, and our patience is linked to the appropriate timing to confront the enemy,' Qassem said in a televised speech. 'Our patience may run out before or after the 60 days, when we decide to do something that you will see directly.' Israel has continued carrying out anti-terror operations in southern Lebanon during the truce, including airstrikes on Hezbollah operatives and infrastructure. Hezbollah was severely battered by the months-long conflict with Israel, which kicked off with the unprecedented beeper explosions. 'In the past, Israel reached Beirut within days, but in the 2024 aggression, it was unable to advance more than a few hundred meters at the front edge. Israel was unable to advance because the resistance fighters stood firm and stood firm in the face of it,' he says. Notably, Israel never attempted to reach any points in Lebanon north of the Litani River. Last week, Hezbollah-linked newspaper Al-Akhbar published an editorial calling for the terror group to resume its attacks against Israel. In recent days, Israel has hinted that it will not withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon at the end of the ceasefire, which had been stipulated as a condition for the truce. Israel has cited Hezbollah's attempts to regroup in the region, along with a failure by Lebanese Army troops to ensure that the area is free of Hezbollah operatives, as reasons why the IDF will likely not withdraw from the region.

Blinken threatened to call off Biden’s visit if Israel didn’t tra...	Blinken described Israeli society as 'traumatized' and unwilling to send aid to Gaza after the savage Hamas attack on October 7th. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In the days following Hamas's brutal assault on Israel on October 7, outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told The New York Times that he threatened to hold up US President Joe Biden's visit if Israel didn't immediately transfer humanitarian aid to Gaza. He described Israeli society as 'traumatized' and unwilling to send aid to Gaza after the savage Hamas attack. Blinken told the NYT, 'I spent with my team nine hours in the I.D.F.'s headquarters in Tel Aviv, six stories underground with the Israeli government, including the prime minister, including arguing for hours on end about the basic proposition that the humanitarian assistance needed to get to Palestinians in Gaza.' He added, 'Israel in the days after October 7 a traumatized society. This wasn't just the prime minister or a given leader in Israel. This was an entire society that didn't want any assistance getting to a single Palestinian in Gaza.' After Blinken tried to persuade the Israeli government to send humanitarian aid to Gaza, he then switched tactics and threatened to hold off Biden's planned trip to Israel if aid wasn't sent. 'President Biden was planning to come to Israel a few days later. And in the course of that argument, when I was getting resistance to the proposition of humanitarian assistance getting in, I told the prime minister, I'm going to call the president and tell him not to come if you don't allow this assistance to start flowing. And I called the president to make sure that he agreed with that, and he fully did,' said Blinken. He then boasted to the reporter that his threat to hold off the president's visit led to the opening of Rafah and Kerem Shalom to aid to Gaza. In several moments during the interview, the interviewer tried to convince Blinken that what was going on in Gaza was genocide, a term Blinken rejected as he insisted Israel's military efforts were to prevent another October 7 from happening. He said, 'When it comes to the actions that Israel has taken, in its just defense in trying to make sure that October 7 never happens again.' In addition, Blinken stated that he holds Hamas, not Netanyahu, responsible for the breakdown in hostage deal talks. 'What we've seen time and again is Hamas not concluding a deal that it should have concluded.' He also expressed dismay that many countries are condemning Israel for the conflict rather than Hamas. 'One of the things that I found a little astounding throughout is that for all of the understandable criticism of the way Israel has conducted itself in Gaza, you hear virtually nothing from anyone since October 7 about Hamas,' he said.

IDF investigation reveals Hamas was fully in charge of Gaza hospi...	Israel's Unit 504 investigators discovered that the hospital director was involved in planning and coordinating terror activity. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An IDF interrogation of Hamas terrorists revealed that the terror group was in complete control of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, Gaza, N12 reports. Israel's Unit 504 investigators discovered that the hospital director was involved in planning and coordinating terror activity and that Hamas planned to escape from the hospital in ambulances when the IDF raid began. IDF and Shin Bet, Israel's security forces, raided the hospital last Friday on intelligence that terrorists using the hospital as a headquarters. Around 240 Hamas terrorists were arrested in the raid, including many who participated in the October 7th massacre. An IDF reservist describes his interrogation of a Hamas terrorist, who admitted that the hospital director was instrumental in directing terrorist activity. The reservist said, 'We discovered that the individual at the center of the event, orchestrating the terror and Hamas activities within the compound, was the hospital director himself.' The reservist added that the hospital director 'strutted around like a peacock, certain that he wouldn't be arrested and fully convinced he was in control of the situation.' Another investigator confirmed that the hospital director was a member of Hamas. The second reservist said Dr. Abu Safiyeh 'really did walk around like a peacock' and added, 'He watched as his doctors were incriminated one by one, still convinced he wouldn't face arrest.' He added, 'But we soon saw through his disguise—it was nothing more than a facade. They were terrorists with blood on their hands. The hospital director finally realized that the entire ruse had unraveled, and in the end, he too was arrested.' Working in coordination with COGAT, the IDF completed an evacuation of 350 patients and medical professionals from the facility prior to the raid. Israel's military also ensured the delivery of food, fuel, and medical supplies to keep the treatment areas functioning. In addition, 95 patients and staff were transferred to the Indonesian hospital in Gaza, along with two generators and thousands of liters of essential supplies. The 401st brigade, located around the perimeter of the hospital, arrested terrorists and eliminated those who attacked troops or resisted arrest. Israeli special forces found in the hospital an arsenal of weapons, including grenades, firearms, and other military equipment.

China feeds Houthi war machine while preaching ‘peace’ in Red Sea	A US intelligence source tells i24 News that in exchange for providing safe passage to Chinese ships, the Houthis are receiving advanced weaponry essential for their ballistic and cruise missile programs. By Jewish Breaking News China’s decades-long investment in Yemen’s infrastructure has morphed into a dangerous new phase, with U.S. intelligence sources revealing Beijing is now secretly arming Houthi terrorists with advanced missile technology for attacks on Red Sea shipping. China and Yemen’s relationship stretches back to the 1950s, with Beijing significantly expanding its economic presence in the country during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Their investments focused primarily on oil, energy, and infrastructure projects, including development of Yemen’s electrical grid. Even after civil war erupted and Saudi-led coalition forces intervened in 2015, China maintained diplomatic relations with both the official Yemeni government and Houthi rebels, while evacuating its own citizens from the conflict zone. On December 21, 2023, following two months of Houthi attacks against shipping in the Gulf of Aden Strait, China for the first time addressed the question of its intention to play a more active role in securing the Red Sea region. 'China stands for protecting the safety of international sea lanes and against causing disturbance to civilian ships. We believe relevant parties, especially major countries with influence, need to play a constructive and responsible role in keeping the shipping lanes safe in the Red Sea,' China’s Foreign Ministry stated at the time. However, it seems that China’s 'active role' means supporting terrorism. A US intelligence source tells i24 News that in exchange for providing safe passage to Chinese ships, the Houthis are receiving advanced weaponry essential for their ballistic and cruise missile programs. Washington has repeatedly confronted Chinese officials with this evidence since September, providing detailed lists of Chinese companies involved in the illegal arms transfer. Without much success so far, the United States is reportedly considering joint action with Israel to sever these Chinese trading networks from the global financial system.

New Hamas propaganda video shows hostage Liri Albag alive	Liri Albag was one of the female lookout soldiers who was taken hostage in Nahal Oz on October 7th, 2023. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A newly released Hamas propaganda video shows signs that Israeli hostage Liri Albag (19) may be alive. Albag was one of the female lookout soldiers who was taken hostage in Nahal Oz on October 7th, 2023. In the video, Liri Albag states she has been in captivity for 450 days and says, 'I'm only 19, with my whole life ahead of me, but right now it feels like everything has come to a standstill.' 'We're entering a really dark year,' she said, her voice trembling with tears. 'The world is beginning to forget us. No one cares. We're trapped in a nightmare.' Hamas releases these videos for the purposes of psychological warfare, often forcing hostages to make statements against Israel's government. As a result, many media outlets refuse to publish the entire videos. Liri Albag then criticized the Israeli government and said, 'If someone from your family were here, would they still be here today?' She continued, 'This is not normal, what you're making us endure. 'Do you have any idea what it's like to live in a place constantly under bombardment, with no shelter?' 'I just want people to remember me, to remember my name,' she concluded in the video. 'All of this is because of the government and the army.' The Albag family released a statement in response to the video, 'Today's video has shattered our hearts,' Albag's family said. 'This is not the daughter and sister we know. She is not well—her immense psychological distress is clear. We watched our brave Liri, struggling to survive and pleading for her life. She's only a few dozen kilometers away, yet for 456 days, we've been unable to bring her home.' They continued, 'We call on the Prime Minister, world leaders, and all decision-makers: It's time to make decisions as if your own children were in their place! Liri is alive, and she must return alive! The responsibility is yours alone. Don't let this opportunity slip by—bring them all back.'

Johnson re-elected speaker on contentious first ballot, House pas...	Johnson ultimately secured 218 votes, all from Republicans, the minimum required to secure a majority among the 434 members-elect present. By JNS The U.S. House of Representatives re-elected Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) as speaker on Friday on a dramatic first ballot after Johnson persuaded Republican holdouts to switch their votes. Nine Republicans initially declined to vote for Johnson when their names were called in the alphabetical roll-call vote for speaker, leaving Johnson with 210 votes to 215 for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) Six of those Republicans subsequently voted for Johnson when their names were called a second time, but Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) and Keith Self (R-Texas) voted for other candidates, leaving Johnson short of an overall majority. Johnson later left the floor with Norman and Self, who minutes later returned to the clerk’s desk to change their votes for Johnson, leaving Massie as the lone Republican holdout in the speaker vote. Norman and Self reportedly had phone calls with President-elect Donald Trump before changing their votes. Johnson ultimately secured 218 votes, all from Republicans, the minimum required to secure a majority among the 434 members-elect present. While Republicans will control both chambers of Congress and the presidency after Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, the difficulty in securing Johnson’s speakership on the first ballot points to the fractious House coalition that Trump and Johnson will have to navigate. Trump congratulated Johnson. 'The people of America have waited four years for common sense, strength and leadership,' Trump wrote. 'They’ll get it now, and America will be greater than ever before.' A letter from the board of the House Freedom Caucus, signed by most of the holdouts, said that they ultimately chose to back Johnson to ensure the timely certification of Trump’s election, but laid out some of their demands for their continued support of the speaker, including spending cuts and border security measures. 'There is zero room for error on the policies the American people demanded when they voted for President Trump,' they wrote. 'We demand the House of Representatives deliver—quickly.' The selection of a House speaker from among the majority party has been a formality for the past century but has become increasingly contentious in recent years on the Republican side of the aisle. John Boehner resigned the speakership in 2015, amid a looming battle with the party’s right flank, and his successor Paul Ryan declined to run for reelection in 2018 after frequently butting heads with Trump. In 2023, eight Republicans joined with every Democrat to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy with a motion to vacate the speakership, the first time that procedure had been executed in American history, and Johnson was subsequently elected speaker. Johnson survived a motion to vacate in May after he received the support of most Democrats and all but 11 Republicans. After Johnson’s re-election as speaker on Friday, the House also agreed to the rules package for the 119th Congress by a vote of 215 to 209. The package increases the threshold for a motion to vacate from one member of the majority to nine. It also includes a provision to ease the passage of a bill instructing the president to impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court over arrest warrants that it has issued for Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The text of the underlying bill, which passed the House 247-155 in June, instructs the president to impose sanctions on any member of the ICC enaged in 'any attempt to investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute' U.S. citizens or the citizens of U.S. allies not party to the Rome Statute of the ICC, including Israel. 'The ICC’s actions against Israel are illegitimate and baseless, including the preliminary examination and investigation of Israel and applications for arrest warrants against Israeli officials, which create a damaging precedent that threatens the United States, Israel and all United States partners who have not submitted to the ICC’s jurisdiction,' the bill says. 'The United States must oppose any action by the ICC against the United States, Israel or any other ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction or is not a state party to the Rome Statute of the ICC,' it adds.

‘Well-developed’ Biden admin anti-Israel ‘January surprise’ plann...	The administration will latch onto section 620(i) of the Foreign Assistance Act, which says, 'that any country that is blocking U.S. humanitarian aid will have its military assistance cut off,' Doran said. By JNS The Biden administration is planning a 'January surprise' that is 'modeled directly on the January surprise of the Obama administration in 2016—that is U.N. Resolution 2334, which basically, to put it a little bit crudely, recognized the Green Line that is the June 5, 1967, ceasefire lines that separated Israel from Jordan as an international boundary,' Michael Doran, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and director of its center for peace and security in the Middle East, said on his podcast on Dec. 31. Speaking with his co-host Gadi Taub, an Israeli historian and writer, Doran said that the Obama administration’s surprise meant that 'any development that Israel has made to the east of the Green Line since the 1967 War is recognized by the U.N. as an illegal settlement.' 'This means including the Western Wall uh is ‘occupied territory,’' the former senior director in the U.S. National Security Council said on the 'Israel Update' podcast. 'Lots of neighborhoods that any Israeli today regards as Israel proper are regarded by 2334 as Israeli illegal Israeli settlements,' Doran said. 'That’s what Barack Obama did for the Israelis—kicked the Netanyahu government in the groin as it was leaving office in 2016, but it did it in a very devious way.' The Obama administration had it 'both ways' by having others put the resolution forward, and then Washington abstained and said it couldn’t go against what the international community wants. 'The Biden administration is planning something similar right now,' Doran said. The administration will latch onto section 620(i) of the Foreign Assistance Act, which says, 'that any country that is blocking U.S. humanitarian aid will have its military assistance cut off,' Doran said. He noted that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin sent Israel a letter to that effect. 'That’s based on 620(i),' Doran said. 'The January surprise is that there will be an official finding by the State Department that Israel is in violation of 620(i). It’s blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza, and then what will happen is that the president will waive the penalties for blocking of the humanitarian aid, but there will have been an official American finding,' Doran said. 'There will be an official American finding, but there will be no penalties to Israel, so again the administration gets to have it both ways. Finds Israel guilty but then says, ‘Well we’re not going to do anything about it.' 'But there’s the official finding and then the ball moves to the Security Council, where Algeria or Slovenia will take it and get a U.N. resolution that will punish Israel in some way,' he added. 'The United States again will either support the resolution or abstain depending upon the wording of it.' Step three, according to Doran, is that the International Court of Justice, International Criminal Court, European Union and others will use the official American finding to pressure Israel. 'That’s the January surprise that is coming,' Doran said. He added that it’s not clear if the surprise is going to happen, though, as there are 'two camps' in the Biden administration that 'are fighting it out.' 'The big question is whether the president and the secretary of state are going to sign on to it or not,' he said. 'But the plan has been well developed.' The incoming Trump administration and Congress can also prevent such a plan from going into effect, he said. USAID head Samantha Power, deputy secretary Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary Barbara Leaf and under secretary Uzra Zeya support the 'January surprise' plan, as do special envoy Lise Grande, State Department legal adviser Margaret Taylor and Ned Price, deputy to U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield, according to Doran. Doran cited White House staffers, including Curtis Ried, chief of staff and executive secretary of the National Security Council, and Jon Finer, principal deputy national security advisor, as supporters of the plan. Those in the opposing camp include Derek Chollet, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and advisers to the president Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein, according to Doran, who said that Blinken and Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, are 'on the fence.'

Israeli study unlocks potential for tailored dairy products to en...	The findings revealed that small milk fat globules promote the growth of Bacillus subtilis, a beneficial bacterium, while larger globules trigger biofilm formation—a behavior linked to bacterial adaptation and resilience. By Pesach Benson, TPS An Israeli study on the relationship between milk globules and bacteria released on Thursday could open new avenues for the development of probiotic-rich dairy products and infant nutrition. Researchers from Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Rehovot-based Agriculture Research Organization discovered that the size of milk fat globules — not just their chemical composition — plays a decisive role in how they interact with bacteria. The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Food Chemistry. Milk fat globules are small droplets of fat that are dispersed in milk. These globules are surrounded by a membrane made up of proteins, phospholipids, and other molecules that help keep the fat suspended in the liquid milk. The fat contained in these globules is the primary source of energy in milk and contributes to its flavor and texture. These globules, secreted by mammary gland epithelial cells, are essential for delivering nutrients in milk. The study, led by Professor Nurit Argov-Argaman from Hebrew University’s Robert H. Smith Faculty of Agriculture, Food and Environment, focuses on how the size of the globules impacts interactions with bacteria. Researchers examined globules derived from both mammary gland cells and raw milk, analyzing their effects on bacterial growth and biofilm formation. The findings revealed that small milk fat globules promote the growth of Bacillus subtilis, a beneficial bacterium, while larger globules trigger biofilm formation—a behavior linked to bacterial adaptation and resilience. Interestingly, these structural properties had no effect on Escherichia coli, a pathogenic bacterium, underscoring the specificity of these interactions. To further validate the importance of structure over composition, scientists tested a synthetic lipid mixture mimicking the chemical makeup of small globules. The synthetic mixture failed to stimulate bacterial growth, reinforcing the conclusion that physical structure is a critical factor. 'Our research highlights the intricate ways in which the physical characteristics of milk fat globules can influence microbial dynamics, offering potential pathways to enhance health through natural dietary components,' Argov-Argaman said. The study also included metabolomic profiling, which demonstrated distinct metabolic responses of bacteria to different globule sizes. These findings suggest that milk’s structural properties could be harnessed to support beneficial bacteria while mitigating harmful bacterial behavior, offering new strategies for dairy science and nutrition. Notably, the research found functional similarities between raw milk globules and those secreted by mammary gland cells, emphasizing the evolutionary role of milk in shaping microbial ecosystems. The insights pave the way for innovations in enhancing the health properties of dairy and other foods, with implications for infant nutrition and gut health. The study suggests that small milk fat globules promote the growth of beneficial bacteria like Bacillus subtilis, which could be leveraged in the development of probiotic-rich dairy products. The findings could inform the development of infant formulas that mimic the beneficial effects of breast milk, enhancing gut health by fostering beneficial bacterial growth. The research might also encourage the exploration of personalized nutrition approaches where dairy products are tailored to individual microbiomes. In addition, manufacturers might be able to design milk products with specific structural properties that promote health benefits, such as enhancing the gut microbiome or improving the bioavailability of nutrients. The fact that larger milk fat globules trigger biofilm formation, which is linked to bacterial resilience, may open a door to preventing harmful bacterial contamination in dairy products.

IDF downs Houthi missile fired from Yemen	Hours later, the military said that the Air Force had also intercepted a drone launched from Yemen. By JNS The Israeli military overnight Thursday downed a missile fired by Houthi terrorists in Yemen that triggered air-raid sirens in central Israel, including in Jerusalem, the greater Tel Aviv area and parts of Judea. The missile was intercepted in Israeli airspace, according to the Israel Defense Forces, which was probing reports of debris falling in the city of Modi’in, located between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. There were no immediate reports of direct injuries or damage. However, Magen David Adom emergency medics treated numerous people who were hurt while rushing to shelter, as well as others suffering from acute anxiety. Flights in and out of Ben-Gurion International Airport were halted for about 30 minutes due to the Houthi attack, with two planes diverting to Larnaca in Cyprus. Hours later, the military said that the Air Force had intercepted a drone launched from Yemen. The unmanned aerial vehicle was downed before crossing into Israeli territory; thus no alerts were activated in accordance with policy.

The missile was downed before crossing into Israeli territory, according to the military. Air-raid sirens were nevertheless activated due to fears of falling fragments from the interception. Last Friday night, the IDF intercepted a Houthi missile that triggered air-raid sirens across the Jerusalem, Judea and Dead Sea areas. It was the first time sirens sounded in the capital since the Iranian attack on Oct. 1. The previous night, sirens blared in the greater Tel Aviv area as the IDF intercepted another Houthi missile fired from Yemen. A U.S. THAAD anti-missile battery assisted in the interception, in the first such instance since the system was deployed to Israel in October. Houthi terrorists have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the terrorist invasion of the northwestern Negev on Oct. 7, 2023. On Dec. 26, the Israeli Air Force conducted strikes on the western coast of and deep inside Yemen, including at Sanaa International Airport in the Houthi-controlled capital. The targets included the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations, in addition to terrorist infrastructure in the Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports. 'These military targets were used by the Houthi terrorist regime to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials. This is a further example of the Houthis’ exploitation of civilian infrastructure for military purposes,' the IDF said. Speaking from IAF headquarters after the strike on the second night of Chanukah, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is engaged in a modern-day Maccabean struggle. 'We are determined to cut off this terrorist arm of Iran’s axis of evil,' the prime minister said. 'We will persist in this until we complete the task.'

‘I want to join Hezbollah, kill Jews’ – US army veteran indicted ...	KIKEKILLER313' - Dual US-Irish citizen who had served in the US Army indicted on terror charges after he tried to enlist in the pro-Iranian Lebanese terror group Hezbollah, aspired to 'kill Jews.' By World Israel News Staff An American Army veteran who met with Islamist terrorists in Syria and Lebanon and attempted to enlist in the pro-Iranian terror group Hezbollah was indicted by a grand jury Thursday, the Justice Department announced in a statement. The suspect has been identified as 24-year-old Jack Danaher Molloy, formerly a resident of Pittsburgh, who holds dual U.S. and Irish citizenship. Molloy was an active-duty member of the U.S. Army, the Justice Department said. On December 6th, Molloy was arrested in Chicago, before being transferred to Pittsburgh for his indictment on charges of attempting to support a foreign terrorist organization and making false statements involving international terrorism to a federal agency. According to the indictment, Molloy travelled to Lebanon this past August. In October, Molloy left Lebanon for Syria. During his trip to the region, Molloy attempted to enlist in the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group Hezbollah. While in Lebanon, Hezbollah officials declined Molloy's request, telling him the time was not right and that he needed to take 'other steps' before he could enlist. In Syria, Molloy tried to join the Syrian branch of Hezbollah, but was again turned down, after which he returned to the United States. Moving to western Pennsylvania, Molloy remained in contact with Hezbollah officials over the internet, and continued his efforts to join the group. After returning to the United States, Molloy publicly expressed violent antisemitic views, using social media handles and email accounts with variations of the phrases 'Kike Killer' and 'Gas the Jews.' One X/Twitter handle used by Molloy was 'KIKEKILLER313.' Molloy informed his mother that he planned to murder Jews. 'But your master plan was to join Hezbollah and kill Jews?' his mother asked him via Whatsapp. 'Yes,' Molloy responded. Investigators found Hezbollah propaganda material and antisemitic content on Molloy's cell phone, including violent, pro-Nazi imagery. A depiction of the 'Pepe the Frog' character as a Nazi murdering a Jewish man. The image was found on US Army veteran Jack Danaher Molloy's phone. (US Justice Department) The charges for making false statements to a federal agency stem from an interview Molloy gave to FBI agents on October 20th of this year, when he arrived in Pittsburgh International Airport following his trip to Lebanon and Syria. Molloy falsely claimed that he had no plans to join Hezbollah and denied meeting with Hezbollah representatives. If convicted, Molloy could face up to 20 years in prison for the terror charge, and 8 years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines for making false statements.

Israeli air force bombs military research center in Aleppo	Multiple explosions reported in northern Syria as Israeli fighter jets bomb military and scientific research labs in Aleppo, following nearly 500 airstrikes in Syria in less than a month. By World Israel News Staff Israeli warplanes bombed multiple targets in northern Syria late Thursday night, local media outlets and a human rights watch group reported Friday morning. Residents of the Aleppo district told AFP that explosions rocked the al-Safirah area late Thursday night. 'They hit defense factories, five strikes,' one resident told AFP. 'The strikes were very strong. It made the ground shake, doors and windows opened — the strongest strikes I ever heard… It turned the night into day.' Syria's Sham FM radio station confirmed the attacks, saying that the strikes had hit two research facilities in a rural area outside of al-Safirah. The Israeli military did not respond to the reports. The London-based, anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) identified one of the two facilities targeted in the strikes as a military research lab, while it described the second as a 'scientific research' center. SOHR reported that at least seven 'huge explosions' were heard during the strikes. There were no immediate reports of casualties, SOHR said. Thursday's strikes mark the 498th Israeli airstrikes in Syria since the collapse of former President Bashar Assad's regime on December 8th, SOHR claimed. The strikes came just hours after the IDF confirmed Thursday that Israeli special forces units had conducted a group operation targeting an underground missile factory in September. According to the Israeli military, the facility was used to manufacture guided missiles, which were assembled on behalf of Iran and transferred to the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah. The raid, which was carried out on a facility outside Masyaf near the Mediterranean coast, involved dozens of Israeli aircraft and over 100 special forces soldiers, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said.

Report: Biden discussed possible strike on Iranian nuclear facili...	White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan reportedly briefed President Biden on possible American strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, should Iran attempt rapid nuclear breakout ahead of Trump inauguration. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden was briefed on options for an American airstrike against Iranian nuclear facilities recently, ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, Axios reported Thursday night. Citing three separate sources with knowledge of the briefing, the report stated that White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan presented President Biden with various options for American military interventions in Iran to prevent the Islamic republic from pursuing a rapid nuclear breakout during Biden's lame-duck period prior to Trump's inauguration. The briefing reportedly took place roughly one month ago, and according to the sources cited in the report, Biden did not reach a final decision on how to respond should Iran attempt to produce a nuclear weapon before Trump enters office. One American official with knowledge of the briefing said the meeting was not held in response to any new information suggesting Iran was in fact moving towards a rapid nuclear breakout. Rather the briefing was held as part of talks inside the administration on 'prudent scenario planning' for various potentialities, including the possibility Iran achieve 90% uranium enrichment prior to Trump's January 20th inauguration. Iran is currently estimated to have achieved 60% uranium enrichment, leaving its nuclear program positioned to reach nuclear breakout capacity - producing 90%-enriched weapons-grade uranium - within a matter of days. The United Nations' atomic watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, believes Iran has approximately enough 60%-enriched uranium to potentially produce four atomic bombs at 90% enrichment with a short breakout time. A second official said there are no active talks in the White House regarding plans to attack Iran's nuclear program. Sullivan reportedly believes Iran's defeats in the ongoing proxy war with Israel, along with the losses suffered by key allies including Hamas and Hezbollah and the collapse of the Assad regime, combined with the damage to the Iranian air defense network, have made an American attack on Iran's nuclear program more viable. However, an American official cited in the report said the National Security Advisor did not make any recommendation to the president.

Man claiming to be Hamas member threatens mother of a hostage	The man said told the hostage's mother she would have to go the Hague and testify that Israel 'has been murdering our children.' By World Israel News Staff A man who spoke Hebrew in a Persian accent and claimed to be a member of Hamas called Julie Kupershtein, the mother of hostage Bar Kupershtein and threatened her, KAN reports. 'It was early in the morning,' Kupershtein told KAN. 'I received a phone call, and the person on the other end asked, 'Bar's mother?' I was deeply offended.' 23-year-old Bar Kupershtein was kidnapped at the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, 2023. The man who claimed to be a member of Hamas told her 'If you want to see Bar' that she would have to go the Hague and testify that Israel 'has been murdering our children.' The man then accused Julie Kupershtein of 'not doing enough' to bring her son home. He also told her to 'go out and protest in the streets and overthrow the government.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pushing to have all living hostages held in the Gaza Strip released together during the first phase of a possible ceasefire deal with Hamas, according to an Arabic media report Wednesday night. The report, published by the London-based, Qatari-owned New Arab or Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news site, cited a senior Egyptian security official involved in brokered hostage-deal talks between Israel and Hamas in Doha, Qatar. The Egyptian official claimed that during the latest round of talks, which ended in late December, significant progress was made, with the two sides left on the verge of a major breakthrough and the drafting of a semi-final text for a deal. At the time that talks were suspended, the official continued, Egyptian and Qatari officials were awaiting Hamas’s timetable for hammering out the remaining major issues, including the details of an IDF withdrawal from the Gaza Strip during the ceasefire, the timing of the conclusion of the current war, and the number of jailed terrorists released in a possible deal who would be deported upon their release. Thus far, ceasefire talks have centered around proposals for a three-phase deal, according to which 30-35 Israeli captives would be released in the first stage, with the remaining captives – including the remains of dead hostages – to be released in the second and third stages.

Palestinian Authority forced to cut ‘pay for slay’ funding by 30-...	Hirsch: '2024 offers clear evidence that terrorist payments can be reduced through the right mix of economic, legal, and operational measures.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News According to research, payments made by the Palestinian Authority as part of its 'pay-for-slay' program have decreased by 30 to 40% in 2024, despite an expected increase. 'Pay-for-slay' is a term used to describe the PA's program of grants and funding for those who carry out terror attacks against Israelis. Col. (res.) Adv. Maurice Hirsch, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, carried out the study and was surprised at the results. He told the Jerusalem Post, 'Surprisingly, we're seeing a trend opposite to what we expected.' Hirsch added, 'Despite expectations of a sharp increase in payments due to the PA's policy and the high number of arrests and casualties among terrorists, we are actually seeing a significant decline.' Hirsch identified several factors that have led to the decrease in payments. First, bureaucratic difficulties have arisen since the Red Cross representatives have been prevented from visiting prisons. Second, Hirsch said, 'The economic pressure on the Palestinian Authority has reached an unprecedented level. According to new data from the Finance Ministry, Israel has deducted approximately NIS 3 billion from PA funds through November 2024.' A third factor is the ongoing war in Gaza, which has prevented the transfer of funds and the presentation of documents to receive them. Hirsch said, 'Terrorists' families are struggling to submit necessary forms and even receive the funds themselves.' Hirsch, who formerly served as chief military prosecutor in Judea and Samaria, says the lowered payments do not signal an ideological shift but are the result of logistical and economic obstacles. He notes that this is the first time in history the PA has made cuts to its 'pay-for-slay' program, and this development has been the direct result of Israel's actions and the pressure on the PA's economy. The report points to a direction Israel can take to interfere with the 'Pay-for-slay' program in the future. Hirsch said, '2024 offers clear evidence that terrorist payments can be reduced through the right mix of economic, legal, and operational measures. If we maintain this approach, we could see even further reductions in terror compensation next year.'

North Carolina inaugurates first Jewish governor in state history	Stein wasted no time announcing his first act as governor will be to spearhead recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. By Jewish Breaking News North Carolina officially welcomed its first Jewish governor on Wednesday during a historic swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol building in Raleigh. 'Today I stand before you humbled by this responsibility, grateful for this opportunity and ready to get to work for you, the people of North Carolina,' said Josh Stein after taking his oath of office on an 1891 edition of the Tanach. 'The work ahead of us is significant, but the time is now to build a safer, stronger North Carolina, where our economy continues to grow and works for everyone, where our public schools are excellent and our teachers are well-paid, and where our neighborhoods are safe and our personal freedoms are protected.' In becoming North Carolina’s 76th governor, Stein will continue the state’s long tradition of Democratic leadership who have held the governorship for all but three terms since 1900. The 58-year-old brings substantial political experience to the role, having first won election to the state Senate in 2008. He later resigned that position in March 2016 to successfully campaign for attorney general. During his gubernatorial campaign, Stein advocated for a broad platform that included economic growth, education improvement and job creation. Stein also wasted no time announcing his first act as governor will be to spearhead recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Savage winds, historic rainfall, and spawned tornadoes ravaged North Carolina when Helene made landfall on September 27, unleashing catastrophic flooding and landslides that claimed more than 100 lives statewide. Scores of families have lost their homes entirely, while tens of thousands more face extensive repairs. Millions more were cut off from water, electricity, medical facilities, and communications. Emergency responders are still struggling to reach isolated communities after roads and bridges either buckled or washed away completely. 'We must act with urgency to help the people of western North Carolina recover from Hurricane Helene. We must help rebuild housing, support small businesses, and restore broken infrastructure,' he said.

Israeli minister: ‘Turkey is becoming the new Iran in Syria’	Since the beginning of the Gaza war, Turkey has become increasingly hostile towards Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter told Israel National News that Israel should not place too much trust in the new regime in Syria, where 'Turkey is becoming the new Iran.' Although the Syrian rebels that overthrew the regime of Bashar al-Assad have made several statements about not wanting conflict with Israel, Dichter said their background with terrorist organizations should be regarded with caution. Dichter said, 'The new regime in Syria has left many uncertain about its origins.' He explained, 'Abu Mohammad al-Julani, the current leader, has ties to Al-Qaeda. His spiritual mentor, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was once a key figure alongside Osama Bin Laden. Given this background, it's hard to believe that this regime will eventually guide Syria in the way we expect.' Dichter also cautioned against the growing influence of Turkey in Syria. 'Turkey is increasingly resembling Iran in Syria. While Iran backed Bashar al-Assad, Turkey supports Abu Mohammad al-Julani,' he said. 'As we know, Turkey is no longer the reliable ally it once was. The key difference is that Iran was never part of NATO, whereas Turkey is a member,' Dichter added. Since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, Turkey has become increasingly hostile toward Israel. Erdogan has hosted Hamas leaders and threatened to invade Israel to forcibly stop the war in Gaza. He has repeatedly urged Israel to avoid military actions in Lebanon and Syria. However, Turkey itself seems poised to launch a military operation in Syria aimed at Kurdish groups. Furthermore, Erdoğan backs the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) terrorist group, which is led by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, who now uses his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa. Erdoğan accuses Israel and the IDF of intentionally killing Palestinian civilians in their fight against terrorism. However, experts argue that Turkey's military actions in Iraqi Kurdistan, which have directly targeted civilians, violate international humanitarian law and raise serious concerns about genuine human rights abuses.

IAF kills Hamas Internal Security chief in Khan Yunis	On Thursday afternoon, the IAF struck Hamas terrorists operating in a command and control center that was embedded inside the Khan Yunis Municipality building in the humanitarian zone. By JNS Overnight Wednesday, the Israeli Air Force conducted a targeted strike in Khan Yunis, killing Hassam Shahwan, the head of Hamas’s Internal Security Force in southern Gaza. 'The Hamas Internal Security Force has conducted violent interrogations of the Gazan population, violating human rights and suppressing dissent within the organization,' the Israel Defense Forces noted on Thursday, adding that Shahwan was responsible for coordinating intelligence assessments with Hamas’s 'military' wing to plan and execute attacks on the IDF in the Gaza Strip. The airstrike on the terrorist operating in the humanitarian zone was carried out with careful measures to minimize civilian harm, including precise munitions and aerial surveillance, the IDF said. On Thursday afternoon, the IAF struck Hamas terrorists operating in a command and control center that was embedded inside the Khan Yunis Municipality building in the humanitarian zone. According to the IDF, the terrorists used the command and control center to plan and execute attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel. The IDF emphasized its commitment to defending Israeli citizens while continuing operations against terrorist organizations such as Hamas, which violates international law and uses civilians as human shields. Halevi promises fair deal for reservists IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi delivered a message on Tuesday to the hundreds of thousands of reserve soldiers who have fought in the multi-front war since the Hamas-led invasion on Oct. 7, 2023. 'The IDF and the government are making a significant effort to reward the reservists. We are committed to you—that is the contract,' Halevi said during a situational assessment held in Netzarim Corridor that bisects the Gaza Strip between north and south. הרמטכ״ל ללוחמי המילואים בעזה: צה״ל עושה מאמץ גדול עם הממשלה לתגמל את המילואים. אנחנו מחוייבים אליכם - זה החוזה pic.twitter.com/Pnav819eK3 &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) January 1, 2025 The military leader also lit the seventh Chanukah candle. He was joined by OC Southern Command Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman; Brig. Gen. Yoav Brunner, commander of the 99th Reserve Infantry Division; Col. Ido Kass, commander of the 551st Reserve Paratroopers Brigade; and reserve soldiers operating in the area. Gaza rocket intercepted After sirens were activated in Holit at 11:57 a.m., the IAF intercepted a projectile fired from the southern Gaza Strip, the military said. Holit is a kibbutz located in the Hevel Shalom region of southwestern Israel. It falls under the jurisdiction of the Eshkol Regional Council. Palestinian terrorists in the Gaza Strip fired two rockets at Israel just as the clock struck midnight on Tuesday night, marking the new year. Israeli air defenses intercepted one of the rockets, with the other hitting an open field, the IDF said. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, which caused no injuries or damage. On Monday evening, terrorists in Gaza fired three rockets at southern Israel. One rocket, which triggered sirens in the border kibbutz of Kissufim, struck an open area, the military said. Just over two hours later, the Israeli Air Force intercepted two rockets launched from the northern Strip. There were no reports of injuries or damage in the attacks. On Sunday, Palestinian terrorists in northern Gaza fired five rockets at Israeli communities in the 'Gaza Envelope,' the area near the coastal enclave. Two rockets were intercepted, according to the Israel Defense Forces, with the others apparently striking open areas. A day earlier, the IAF downed two rockets fired by terrorists in northern Gaza towards Jerusalem. The attacks triggered air-raid sirens in the capital, the Western Negev and the Judean Foothills (the Shfela). The IDF’s year-plus-long offensive against Hamas has greatly curbed rocket fire from the Strip, although Palestinian terrorists still intermittently target the Jewish state.

How the Biden admin allowed Iran to rake in illicit oil cash amid...	Iran generates roughly $1 billion from the smuggling scheme annually, Reuters reported, and money that is 'directly funding the Iranian threat network,' according to the intelligence report. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Earlier this year, officials from across the Biden-Harris administration reviewed intelligence detailing Iraq's central role in a billion-dollar Iranian oil smuggling scheme. But they largely ignored that intelligence, according to those briefed on the matter, giving Tehran what one former U.S. official described as a 'free pass' to evade American sanctions and rake in illicit cash. Officials from the State Department, Treasury Department, and intelligence community received the 45-page intelligence report in April and sat for multiple briefs on its material. Assembled by a number of international intelligence agencies and reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon, the report identified Iraq, the world's fifth-largest oil producer, as central to an Iranian 'oil and fuel smuggling' operation that significantly expanded in 2022. Iran generates roughly $1 billion from the smuggling scheme annually, Reuters reported, and money that is 'directly funding the Iranian threat network,' according to the intelligence report. The briefing on that report came just months after Iran-backed terror group Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel, sparking a war that later spread to Lebanon, where fellow Iranian terror proxy Hezbollah launches near-daily missile barrages at the Jewish state. But the Biden-Harris administration apparently did little to act on the intelligence. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which administers and enforces trade sanctions, responded to the report by drawing up sanctions packages targeting Iraq—but never actually put them in place, according to a former U.S. official briefed on the matter. The administration's intimate knowledge of the smuggling operation has not been reported. It reflects a lax approach to Iran that has allowed the Islamic regime to rake in around $200 billion in illicit funds after Trump-era sanctions nearly bankrupted Tehran. And while Israel's war on Hamas and Hezbollah has crippled Iran's terror proxies, Tehran's financial resurgence could spark an early diplomatic confrontation when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month. 'The reality here is that this was a very inconvenient truth for the U.S. government,' Michael Knights, a Middle East security analyst with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank, told the Free Beacon. 'It's clear when the U.S. government received detailed information on the commingling and Iranian militia oil smuggling that they already knew' of the scheme and Iran's profits from it, Knights added. The sanctions evasion scheme allegedly involves Iraqi prime minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and an array of Iranian-controlled militia groups, most notably the U.S.-designated terror outfit Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq (AAH). Al-Sudani’s government, which has become increasingly loyal to Tehran’s hardline regime, enables Iranian proxies to 'smuggle illicit fuel allocations across Iraq,' according to the intelligence dossier, resulting in Iran’s heavily sanctioned crude oil being mixed into global supplies exported out of Baghdad. By shielding Iraq from punitive measures in an attempt to build relations with al-Sudani, the Biden-Harris administration has brought Baghdad and Tehran closer than ever before, one former U.S. official told the Free Beacon. 'Despite Iran’s growing and dominant role in Iraq, the Biden administration has refused to sanction or meaningfully confront their role in an effort to protect the current Iraqi prime minister, Sudani, and to portray Iraq as a constructive regional partner,' said the official, who spoke on background to discuss private briefings and deliberations. 'This approach deliberately ignores the reality that Iran and its proxies effectively control Iraq’s institutions, including the industrial fuel smuggling and crude commingling. It’s as if the Biden administration wants to hide the fact that Iraq remains Iran’s most important client state.' The Treasury Department declined to comment. The State Department, which also administers sanctions on Iran’s oil exports, did not respond to a request for comment. The Iraqi embassy in Washington, D.C., declined to comment. The intelligence report in question lists a constellation of companies in Iraq, Iran, and other Middle East nations that divert a portion of Iraqi fuel exports and allow them to be smuggled on the black market for a profit. The cash is then diverted to Iranian militias in Iraq as well as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), which oversees the militias. Iran’s AAH terror group conducts 'direct oversight' on the operation and coordinates with 'Iraqi government officials and ministries,' according to a copy of the intelligence report reviewed by the Free Beacon. The illicit revenue is ultimately converted into dollars and 'returned to Iranian proxies and Iran.' 'This significant level of Iranian threat financing by Iraq and its institutions has been reported to the relevant U.S. and international authorities,' the report states. In addition to the smuggling operation, Iraq’s oil sector blends illicit Iranian fuel products into their own legitimate supplies, allowing them to be openly sold on the international market in defiance of strict U.S. sanctions. The proceeds from these sales are also 'returned to Iran’s proxies and the IRGC,' according to the report. Iraq’s offshore oil sites, the intelligence indicates, have effectively become a 'laundromat' for sanctioned Iranian crude. For Knights, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy analyst, the intelligence report outlines the need for the incoming Trump administration to take action. 'The good news is that the Trump administration has a large potential set for sanctions,' Knights said. 'Iranian commingling of sanctioned crude into Iraqi exports is now well understood. And militia diversion of Iraqi government oil can also be sanctioned very easily. In 2025, Iraqi oil exporting institutions are likely to be sanctioned, in part or in full, by the United States.'

Agnes Keleti, Holocaust survivor who won 10 Olympic gymnastics me...	Her 10 total medals remain tied for most in Hungary’s history; fewer than 30 athletes from any country have ever won more. By Philissa Cramer, JTA As a teenager, Agnes Keleti’s athletic pursuits were interrupted by the Nazis, who murdered her father along with more than 500,000 other Hungarian Jews. As a centenarian, she became a global sensation for not only surviving the Holocaust but returning to sports, resuming her gymnastics career to become one of Hungary’s most decorated athletes. Keleti died Thursday at 103 in Budapest, to which she returned after decades in Israel — where she is credited with creating the country’s gymnastics program — to live near her son. She was one week shy of her 104th birthday. 'I was strong and I worked hard,' Keleti told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in 2019, when she was 98. 'Nobody asked questions.' She was referring to her surviving the Holocaust by working as a maid under false papers. (Her mother and sister were saved by Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews before being abducted by the Russians.) But she could have been summarizing her athletic career, which remains unparalleled in an era of ultra-young gymnastics champions. After World War II, Keleti resumed her training as a gymnast in 1946. She was prevented from competing at the London Olympics in 1948 because she broke her collarbone in training. But four years later she won her first Olympic gold medal, in the floor exercise, at the 1952 Helsinki Games. Keleti was 31, competing against athletes 10 years younger. She also won a silver medal and two bronze medals in other events, including uneven bars. This would have been a pinnacle for the career of any professional athlete. But for Keleti, it was merely the warm-up to her spectacular performance at the ’56 Olympics in Melbourne. At 35, competing against gymnasts half her age, she collected four gold medals and two silvers. Her 10 total medals remains tied for most in Hungary’s history; fewer than 30 athletes from any country have ever won more. Under Hungarian policy, which awards a monthly stipend to Olympians based on the number of medals they won, Keleti lived comfortably in her old age. But for most of her life, she did not live in the country she represented. She moved to Israel in 1957, recalling despite dementia at 98 that she had wanted to leave communist Hungary because of antisemitism there. 'It wasn’t a good atmosphere to be Jewish, even for a star athlete,' she said at the time. She ended up in Israel at the urging of a former teacher from Budapest, who persuaded her to attend the 1957 Maccabi Games after she sought asylum in Australia when she was stranded there because of political violence in Hungary. The country was so poor and Keleti’s sport so undeveloped that she had to bring her own bar and rings — but she quickly became a national hero who trained generations of gymnasts. In 1972, Keleti joined Israel’s Olympic team in Munich but was away from the country’s quarters when Palestinian terrorists attacked and killed 11 members of the delegation. Keleti’s star resurged in the social media era, when clips of her performing as a young adult and continuing to stretch on an Israeli beach circulated annually around her birthday as a symbol of Jewish perseverance despite the Holocaust. A video produced by Kveller, JTA’s sister site, has been viewed 33 million times on Facebook alone. In Israel, Keleti also married and had two sons. 'I grew up knowing my mother was Wonder Woman,' son Raphael told JTA in 2019. 'She ran the household, she taught us music, helped with our homework, cooked meals so tasty that all the neighbors’ kids wanted to stay for dinner. Oh, and in her spare time she was an international and local celebrity who traveled to coach athletes at the Olympic Games. No biggie.'

On the morning of October 7, 2023, 10 terrorists stormed the base, sparking a two-hour shootout that claimed the lives of seven soldiers, and 14 months later, even as southern Israel rebuilds, the scars of that day linger. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS The memorial wall at the entrance to this IDF base near the Gaza Strip, adjacent to an outdoor Chanukah menorah, is adorned with the pictures of the eight Israeli soldiers who served here and were killed during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack. Their sacrifice was illuminated anew during the eight-day holiday of lights, as bereaved family members joined soldiers, officers and commanders on Wednesday night seeking solace at the base where their loved ones were stationed. 'This is a holiday of light even though you are dealing with exiting the darkness and coming back to the light,' the head of Home Front Command Maj. Gen. Rafi Milo told the bereaved families. 'But it is your heroism that gives us the strength to continue. Bereaved families members at the Urim Base memorial near the Gaza Strip on Jan. 1, 2025. Photo by Rina Castelnuovo. 'Every time it is difficult to come here, but I feel the need and it is important for us to be here,' said Leah Ayash, whose 19-year-old son Sgt. Itamar Avraham Ayash was killed on the base on Oct. 7. She came to the candle lighting and dinner at the base with her 14-year-old son Yochai. 'We had breakfast and I laundered his pants,' recounted Etti Elazar matter-of-factly. Her son Master Sgt. (res.) Tomer Dolev, 34, rushed back from his vacation in Sinai after receiving an emergency military call-up order. 'We arranged to meet the next day,' she said. Dolev was killed fighting in a nearby agricultural community on Oct. 8. Kabbalist Rabbi Yaakov Ifergan offered words of comfort at the holiday ceremony by noting that the gematria, or numerology, of the Hebrew words 'darkness' and 'light' were the same as the word 'Israel,' before offering blessings to the soldiers in the room, some of whom kissed his hand in reverence. 'Every day I still cry,' said Hanna Cohen, her eyes welling up with tears. Her 19-year-old daughter Sgt. Danit Cohen was among those killed at the base. 'I still cannot bring myself to the place on the base where she was killed. I am still waiting for her to come back.' David Farash, whose 38-year-old ultra-Orthodox son Sgt. Major Aharon Farash was killed, noted that his wife could not visit any other place attacked during the massacre, yet felt comforted coming to the military base. 'There is no other choice but to go on living,' he said. A group of 10 terrorists stormed the base on the morning of Oct. 7, 2023. They were killed in a two-hour-long shootout that left seven soldiers dead. Fourteen months later, amid the rebirth underway in southern Israel, the scars remain. OC Home Front Command Maj. Gen.

Asher Benishti, who heads the IDF Home Front Command’s Southern District and lives in a community near the border with Gaza. 'But in a similar way to the lights of Chanukah that remind us of the darkness that engulfed us and the light we are in today, a year and several months ago we were in total darkness and today we can see specks of light which reduce if don’t totally remove the darkness. But without the darkness we would not know that there is light,' he said.

Israeli hostage attempted to commit suicide in Gaza, Islamic Jiha...	An Israeli man held hostage by Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in the Gaza Strip attempted to commit suicide while in captivity, the terror group claims. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News An Israeli captive held in the Gaza Strip by members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group attempted to commit suicide earlier this week, a spokesman for the organization claimed Thursday. In a series of messages released to the group’s Telegram channel, Abu Hamza, spokesman for Islamic Jihad’s armed wing, the Al Quds Brigades, wrote that an Israeli man held captive had tried to commit suicide three days ago. 'Three days ago, one of our medical teams dealt with a suicide attempt by a prisoner held by one of the security groups within Saraya Al-Quds,' Abu Hamza wrote. The Islamic Jihad spokesman blamed the Israeli government for the captive’s 'psychological state' which led to his attempt to end his own life, linking the 'failure and delay' of hostage deal talks to the attempted suicide. 'The medical team successfully saved the prisoner’s life after his suicide attempt, which was due to his psychological state following new conditions imposed by the Netanyahu government that led to the failure and delay of negotiations for his release.' Abu Hamza claimed that the hostage met the criteria for release during the first phase of a possible ceasefire with Israel. 'The Zionist prisoner who attempted suicide was scheduled to be released as part of the batch of prisoners meeting the conditions and criteria of the first phase of the exchange deal with the enemy.' Israel and Hamas have discussed a possible three-phase ceasefire, with female captives, children, the elderly, and the seriously ill being freed during the first stage of the truce. The Biden administration has also pushed for the inclusion of the remaining American captives in the first stage of a deal. 'As a result of this incident, Saraya Al-Quds issued a decision to tighten security and safety measures for the prisoners,' Abu Hamza continued.

Khamenei meets wounded Hezbollah terrorists in Tehran	Israel’s attacks on Hezbollah’s pagers and radios put at least 1,500 terrorists out of commission, with many blinded or losing hands. By JNS Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on Wednesday marked the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force commander Lt. Gen. Qassem Soleimani by meeting with Hezbollah terrorists wounded in Israel’s Sept. 17-18 pager attacks. According to Tehran’s official IRNA agency, the visiting delegation also included relatives of Hezbollah 'martyrs' killed fighting the Jewish state. Pictures of the event showed some of the Hezbollah terrorists wearing sunglasses. Israel’s attacks on Hezbollah’s pagers and radios put at least 1,500 terrorists out of commission, with many blinded or losing hands. מנהיג איראן ח'אמנאי נפגש עם מחבלי חיזבאללה, שנפגעו במתקפת הביפרים, ועם בני משפחות של מחבלי חיזבאללה שנהרגו בלחימה עם ישראל@asafroz15 pic.twitter.com/RaeFGXODIz &mdash; החדשות - N12 (@N12News) January 1, 2025 'Martyr Soleimani’s constant strategy was to revive the resistance front,' Khamenei was quoted as saying, referring to Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Houthis and other Iranian-backed terrorist organizations. Soleimani, widely considered the architect of the Iran’s global sponsorship of terror, was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Jan. 3, 2020, near Baghdad International Airport. The Israel Defense Forces has devastated Hezbollah, Iran’s terrorist army in Lebanon, in several operations, including the Sept. 17-18 pager attacks, after the group began cross-border attacks on Israel a day after Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, near Gaza. On Sept. 27, Israel dropped at least a dozen 2,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on a Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut, killing the organization’s leader Hassan Nasrallah. 'Know that those who are running wild today will one day be trampled under the feet of believers,' Khamenei warned on Wednesday, adding that U.S. army bases in Syria would soon be 'trampled,' IRNA reported. 'If a nation removes its pillars of stability and strength from the field, it risks becoming like Syria—vulnerable to occupation by the United States, Israel and some regional states,' according to Khamenei. The Islamic Republic’s supreme leader described Lebanon and Yemen as symbols of resistance, promising that its proxies in these countries would emerge victorious over the militaries of the U.S. and Israel. Earlier this week, Iranian Supreme National Security Council secretary Ali Akbar Ahmadian vowed that a new group would emerge in Syria to fight the Jewish state following the fall of the regime of Bashar Assad. 'With the occupation of Syrian territories by the Zionist regime, a new resistance has been born that will manifest itself in the years to come,' Ahmadian declared following a meeting with Oman’s foreign minister. Ahmadian claimed that Tehran’s regional influence had 'not weakened' following the Dec. 8 removal of the Assad regime by a coalition of rebel groups led by the Sunni Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham organization.

Tesla Cybertruck explodes outside Trump hotel, killing 1, injurin...	Fireworks and gas tanks detonated inside the truck, killing a person inside and injuring seven passersby. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A Tesla Cybertruck filled with fireworks, camping fuel and gas tanks exploded Wednesday morning in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas in an incident the authorities are calling a possible terror attack. The futuristic-looking vehicle turned into fireball just after 8:40AM, killing the person inside and injuring seven people on the street. All of the victims were initially reported to be in stable condition and some have already been released from the hospital. The authorities know the identity of the driver, but are not releasing the information as yet to the public. The vehicle was rented in Colorado and driven to the famed casino city, entering a battery-charging station when arriving at 7:30. It was then driven up and down Las Vegas Boulevard for the next hour before the driver parked it in front of the hotel. Seconds later, it blew up, with witnesses saying that they heard and felt several loud explosions, with some being thrown off their feet by the powerful blasts. CNN cited on Thursday 'a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation' as saying that the authorities believe all the flammable materials were linked together and the driver could control their detonation. The FBI is investigating whether the incident could be classified as an act of terrorism, said Jeremy Schwartz, acting special agent in charge for the agency’s local office. As of now, it believes that this was an 'isolated incident.' There is one link to an attack already labeled as a terror attack that had been carried out hours earlier in New Orleans, where a man who had declared his allegiance to the Muslim ISIS extremist group, Shamsud Din Jabbar, plowed a truck into New Year’s revelers in New Orleans and shot several, murdering at least 15 people and injuring 30 before being killed by police. Both trucks were rented through the Turo online car rental company. However, Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill said that this was a 'coincidence' and that 'there is no further threat to the community.' The company itself said no red flags had popped up when the vehicles were being rented. 'We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,' a company spokesperson said. Tesla’s multi-billionaire owner Elon Musk defended his Cybertruck’s reputation, writing on X that the blast was 'unrelated to the vehicle itself' and that 'All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.' He also took credit for the low number of victims, adding, 'The evil knuckleheads picked the wrong vehicle,' as the frame of the truck held firm, which channelled the blast upward instead of outward. 'Not even the glass doors of the lobby were broken.'

IDF will intensify war unless Hamas frees hostages – Israeli Defe...	The Israeli Air Force conducted over 1,400 strikes on Hamas terrorist targets in the Gaza Strip during December. By JNS If Hamas does not release the 100 hostages it has been holding for 454 days and halt its rocket attacks on the Jewish state, Israel will deal it 'blows with a force not seen in Gaza for a long time,' Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday. 'The IDF will intensify its activities against the terrorist nests in Gaza until the release of the hostages and the elimination of Hamas,' Katz warned during a visit to the southern Israeli city of Netivot. Hamas terrorists welcomed 2025 by firing two rockets towards the Netivot area. No damages or injuries were reported in the attack. 'I call on Gaza’s residents to rise up against the murderous Hamas group, which also uses you as human shields, and to bring about the release of the hostages, to prevent suffering and end the war,' Katz said. The defense minister in his remarks highlighted Israel’s 'willingness to make far-reaching compromises in accordance with the principles outlined by the U.S. president.' Israeli ground forces entered Gaza on Oct. 27, 2023, following weeks of airstrikes in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks, in which terrorists murdered some 1,200 people, wounded thousands more and took more than 250 men, women and children back to the Gaza Strip as hostages. Israeli Air Force aircraft conducted more than 1,400 strikes on Hamas terrorist targets in the Gaza Strip during the month of December, the Israel Defense Forces said on Wednesday. The IAF strikes—which were carried out by fighter jets, helicopter gunships and drones—targeted Hamas terrorist operatives, tunnel systems, weapon depots and attack positions, the military said. 'Air Force aircraft and control rooms are in direct contact with the fighting [ground] forces and support the fighting in the various sectors,' the statement continued, adding that the IAF has managed to kill terrorists 'within a few meters' of Israeli soldiers. Jerusalem’s year-plus-long offensive against Hamas and other Iranian-backed groups has greatly curbed rocket fire from Gaza, although the Palestinian terrorists still intermittently target the Jewish state. Following Wednesday’s assault on Netivot, the IDF issued a warning to noncombatants in the Bureij camp, located near the IDF’s Netzarim Corridor dividing Gaza, ahead of a retaliatory strike on Hamas. 'This is an early warning. Terror groups are again firing rockets from this area, which has been warned several times in the past. For your safety, immediately move to the humanitarian zone,' the IDF notice read.

891 fallen IDF soldiers since October 7, highest death toll since...	The IDF observed a troubling increase in suspected suicides, rising from 14 in 2022 to 17 in 2023 and 21 in 2024, with most occurring after the war began. By Pesach Benson, TPS Since Hamas’s October 7 massacre, the Israel Defense Forces has recorded 891 casualties among its soldiers in figures released on Thursday, marking the army’s highest death toll since the Yom Kippur War. The 891 casualties include deaths from operational activities, accidents, and suspected suicides. In 2023, 558 soldiers fell, with 512 killed during operational activity, including 329 on October 7. An additional 16 died in accidents, such as road and training incidents, while 17 cases were investigated as suspected suicides. These included seven active-duty soldiers, four in regular service, and six in the reserves. In 2024, 363 soldiers died, with 295 killed in operational activity and 23 in accidents, mostly road-related. Twenty-one cases were investigated as suspected suicides, 12 of which were among reservists. The IDF also observed a troubling increase in suicide cases. In 2022, there were 14 suspected suicides, which rose to 17 in 2023 and 21 in 2024. Most suicides occurred after the war began. The army added that a 24/7 mental health hotline for soldiers has received more than 3,900 calls since its launch in October 2023. The army has also recruited 800 mental health officers, expanded mental health services, and created a dedicated clinic for active-duty personnel. Commanders are also trained to recognize signs of distress, and comprehensive post-mission debriefings aim to bolster soldiers’ mental resilience. In a landmark ruling, Israel’s High Court of Justice in December approved a military burial in a civilian cemetery for Maj. (res.) Asaf Dagan, an Israel Air Force navigator who committed suicide in October after battling severe post-traumatic stress disorder. Traditionally, Israeli military regulations reserve full military burials in military cemeteries for soldiers who die while on active duty. The family’s legal battle for a military burial became a high-profile case. The conflict has also seen a rise in fatalities from operational accidents. Sixty soldiers died in Gaza and five in Lebanon due to mishaps such as misfires and equipment malfunctions. The army said each case is investigated, with findings used to enhance safety protocols. Most recently, 22-year-old Sgt.-Maj. Yuval Shoham was killed on Tuesday when he was hit by the rotation of the turret of the tank he was in during an operation in the northern Gaza area of Jabaliya. The war marks the Israeli army’s highest death toll since the Yom Kippur War, when at least 2,500 soldiers were killed in 19 days of fighting. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Netanyahu pushing for release of all surviving hostages – report	Israeli prime minister reportedly seeking to have all surviving hostages in Gaza be freed in the first stage of a ceasefire deal with Hamas, instead of splitting up their return over multiple phases. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pushing to have all living hostages held in the Gaza Strip released together during the first phase of a possible ceasefire deal with Hamas, according to an Arabic media report Wednesday night. The report, published by the London-based, Qatari-owned New Arab or Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news site, cited a senior Egyptian security official involved in brokered hostage deal talks between Israel and Hamas in Doha, Qatar. The Egyptian official claimed that during the latest round of talks, which ended in late December, significant progress was made, with the two sides left on the verge of a major breakthrough and drafting of a semi-final text for a deal. At the time talks were suspended, the official continued, Egyptian and Qatari officials were awaiting Hamas' timetable for hammering out the remaining major issues, including the details of an IDF withdrawal from the Gaza Strip during the ceasefire, the timing of the conclusion of the current war, and the number of jailed terrorists released in a possible deal who will have to be deported upon their release. The Egyptian and Qatari negotiators, along with Hamas' negotiating team, were 'surprised' when Netanyahu suddenly raised new conditions for a deal, the source claimed, fueling claims that Israel is attempting to reframe negotiations, with the goal of securing the release of all living Israeli hostages in Gaza during the first phase of the ceasefire. Thus far, ceasefire talks have centered around proposals for a three-phase deal, under which 30-35 Israeli captives will be released in the first stage, with the remaining captives - including the remains of dead hostages - to be released in the second and third stages. Netanyahu, the Egyptian official added, also appeared to be 'evasive' regarding efforts to secure a withdrawal of IDF forces from part of the Gaza Strip during the first phase of the proposed ceasefire.

Report: Hamas has replaced nearly all its war losses with recruit...	Israeli intelligence pegged Hamas' pre-war strength at roughly 25,000. Despite massive losses since October 7th, the terror group has nearly returned to its prior size. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization has replaced a significant portion of its forces lost in combat with Israel since October 7th, according to reports by Israeli media outlets Wednesday. According to estimates by the Israeli military, the Gaza-based group had roughly 25,000 men under arms in the coastal enclave prior to the October 7th, 2023 invasion of southwestern Israel. Since then, the IDF estimates that between 17,000 to 20,000 Gaza terrorists have been killed, the vast majority of them from Hamas. In addition, thousands more have been taken out of action because of wounds suffered during the war, while thousands of others have been captured by Israel. More than 4,300 Gazans are being held by Israel, many of them Hamas operatives. Despite Hamas' significant losses, however, the terror group has effectively replenished its ranks, according to a report by Israel's Channel 12. Together with the much smaller Palestinian Islamic Jihad organization, the two terror groups now have between 20,000 to 23,000 men under arms in the Gaza Strip, the report said. A report published by The Jerusalem Post Wednesday night disputed Channel 12's figures, while confirming that Hamas has recruited thousands of new members. According to the Post, Hamas' military wing currently commands roughly 12,000 combatants. The source cited by the Post also suggested that initial Israeli military estimates putting Hamas' pre-war strength at 25,000 significantly underestimated the terror group's size, suggesting that the figure was likely closer to 40,000. However, the source emphasized that regardless of the number terrorists commanded by Hamas before the war or at present, there has been a notable decline in the quality of its forces, with large numbers of untrained teenagers filling Hamas' ranks.

New Orleans terrorist linked to ISIS, two Israelis among the woun...	Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, said in a video he’d joined ISIS prior to killing at least 15 and injuring 30 in his ramming and shooting attack before being killed by police. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The man who killed at least 15 people and injured 30 when ramming a pickup truck through New Year’s eve revelers in New Orleans and shooting them early Wednesday morning had declared prior to the attack that he had joined the ISIS terror organization. In a video Shamsud-Din Jabbar uploaded to Facebook, he pledged allegiance to the extremist Muslim terror organization. When President Joe Biden mourned the dead c he said that the FBI had reported to him that 'mere hours before the attack,' Jabbar had posted videos 'indicating that he was inspired by ISIS, especially a desire to kill.' His brother, Abdur, told the New York Times (NYT) that Shamsud had converted to Islam when young and had been 'a sweetheart really, a nice guy, a friend, really smart, caring.' His heinous actions came from 'some type of radicalization, not religion,' he added. Jabbar also posted that he was planning to kill his family. He had been twice divorced and had two daughters, aged 15 and 20. He also allegedly discussed his debts and failing business. The 42-year-old Texas native had rented an Airbnb about a mile away from Bourbon Street, the site he picked for his attack, as well as the Ford pickup truck he used in the rampage. The black ISIS flag was flying from the back of his truck as he went around a flimsy police barricade cordoning off the street festivities and drove it through a crowd. After the police shot and killed him, they found a blue cooler rigged with explosives and nails in the truck, and bomb-making materials in the Airbnb. The FBI is also looking for other suspects as they do not think Jabbar 'was solely responsible,' the agency said in a Wednesday afternoon press conference. Their agents are 'conducting a number of court-authorized search warrants in New Orleans and other states.' A man was seen surrendering to law enforcement officials outside Jabbar’s run-down Houston home that same afternoon, although it is as yet unclear if he was linked to the terror attack. Jabbar had served in the U.S. armed forces as an IT specialist for almost eight years, according to his service record. During his active duty, he was posted to Afghanistan from February 2009 to January 2010. After five years in the reserves, he left in 2020 with the rank of staff sergeant. He had received several ribbons and service medals during his time in the army. Two Israelis were injured in the attack, one of them seriously, according to the Israeli foreign ministry. Both the ministry and the Consulate General in Houston are in contact with the hospitals and the families of the injured.

Al Jazeera broadcasts banned in Judea & Samaria	Palestinian Authority ratchets up sanctions against Qatar-based network, shutting down broadcasts across all of Judea and Samaria after accusing Al Jazeera of backing rogue terror groups. By World Israel News Staff The Palestinian Authority has shutdown broadcasts of the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network across the entirety of autonomous PA areas in Judea and Samaria, the Palestinian Authority announced Wednesday night. According to a report by WAFA, a Palestinian Authority mouthpiece, the decision was made by a joint ministerial committee which brought together representatives of the Culture Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and the Telecommunications Ministry. The move prohibits Al Jazeera television broadcasts across Judea and Samaria, and also bars Al Jazeera journalists and other staff from working on the network's behalf in areas under the PA's jurisdiction. Ramallah accused the Qatari network of 'repeated violations' of PA regulations with the broadcasting of 'inciteful content' and 'misinformation.' The Palestinian Authority emphasized that the ban is temporary, and that it will remain in effect 'until the network addresses its legal status in accordance with Palestinian regulations.' Last month, the PA barred Al Jazeera from reporting in parts of Samaria, including Shechem (Nablus), Jenin, Tubas, Tulkarem, Qalqilya, and Salfit. The PA's ruling Fatah party has decried Al Jazeera's coverage of ongoing civil unrest across Judea and Samaria, as well as internecine violence in the northern Samaria city of Jenin, where officers from the paramilitary Palestinian National Security Forces have clashed with a rogue terror group for nearly a month. On December 5th, PNSF forces entered Jenin to challenge the Jenin Brigades, an alliance of terrorist groups, including Hamas, which has effectively ruled the city since 2022. Since then, the PNSF has attempted to reassert PA control over the city, leading to multiple clashes with the Jenin Brigades. During the PNSF's Jenin operation, the Palestinian Authority has accused Al Jazeera of promoting the Jenin Brigades' cause with biased reporting.

Trump won’t tolerate Houthi attacks, will ‘threaten’ Iran	Trump will not stand for having U.S. Navy ships attacked every day by the Houthis using Iranian missiles,' says former Trump official. By World Israel News Staff Incoming president Donald Trump will step up American military efforts against the Houthis to curb attacks on U.S. military assets, Israel, and international shipping, according to several analysts. Since the outbreak of the October 7th war, the Houthis have paralyzed a vital shipping lane near Yemen and launched hundreds of explosive drones and ballistic missiles at Israel. Under outgoing President Joe Biden, U.S. campaigns aiming to deter the Houthis have failed. But once Trump takes office, experts say, the Houthis may be forced to stop their attacks. 'President Trump likely will add the Houthis back on the [State Department’s] Foreign Terrorists Organizations list, after President Joe Biden’s wrongheaded decision to remove them, as one of his first acts of president in 2021,' Mark Dubowitz, the CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Jerusalem Post. Re-classifying the Houthis as terrorists will allow for harsher sanctions on the group, helping cripple them economically. It's also likely that Trump will show a zero-tolerance policy for Houthi attacks on American military assets, which have occurred numerous times during Biden's tenure. 'Trump will not stand for having U.S. Navy ships attacked every day by the Houthis using Iranian missiles,' Elliott Abrams, who served as the U.S. Special Representative for Iran from 2020 to 2021, told the Post. 'He will hit the Houthis harder, and he will threaten Iran that if a missile [that] Iran supplied kills an American, Iran will get hit directly.' Trump will probably organize a coalition to stymie the terrorists' activities, including regional powers like Saudi Arabia, who have a longstanding conflict with the Houthis. Gulf countries, with the exception of Bahrain, have so far been reticent to join an anti-Houthi coalition because the 'U.S. government refuses to give us protection and means to intercept missiles and UAVs if attacked by the Houthis,' Jonathan Schanzer, executive director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Post. 'They have been attacking US warships for months on end, not to mention firing ballistic missiles at Israel,' Schanzer added. 'We should expect Trump to reverse the Biden policy, which has been to tolerate the group’s terror activities. I would expect a much tougher policy after January 20.'

Fallen soldier ‘warned about dangers of Nova Festival’	Nitai Amar, 22, battled terrorists alone near site of Nova Festival; book says he warned about suspicious activity near border fence, but was ignored. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli soldier who was killed while fighting Hamas terrorists during the October 7th onslaught had previously warned his superiors about the dangers posed by events held near the Gaza border fence, but was ignored, according to a new book. On October 7th, 2023, Nitai Amar was at home with his family in Alumim, a religious kibbutz adjacent to Gaza, for the Simchat Torah holiday. After non-stop rocket fire from the Strip and reports that terrorists had infiltrated into Israel, Nitai, 22, grabbed his weapon and told his family he was heading to his army base. But instead, his mother Revital told Hebrew-language outlet Mako, he drove towards the Re'im Forest, where the Nova Festival was held. The day before the massacre, she said, Nitai had driven past the festival site and was concerned by the party's location being so close to the border. 'Nitai was very worried and felt something was wrong,' Revital said. 'He was shocked and said he couldn't believe the security authorities had approved' the festival being held adjacent to the fence. She added that she believes 'on October 7th, Nitai understood exactly what was going to happen there, and he was prepared for it.' Shortly after Nitai left the house that Saturday morning, his family lost contact with him. The next day, the authorities informed them that his body had been found at Re'im Forest. He had been shot just once. According to Revital, there was never an investigation conducted into the exact circumstances of his death. 'People who came to the funeral told us that our son was a hero and killed many terrorists in battle,' she said. 'Bedouin [army] scouts said that he eliminated many terrorists. Beyond that, we know nothing.' A book about the October 7th massacre, The Gaza Division Has Been Captured, specifically mentions Nitai Amar as a soldier who warned about the dangers of increased Hamas activity near the border fence prior to the massacres. 'Nitai warned division commanders several times about suspicious objects that were placed near the fence, which he thought were explosive devices,' reads the book. 'He even suggested sending out a patrol to inspect them. No one heeded his request.' 'In the end, Nitai was killed' near the exact place he had warned about, said Revital.

Ex-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant gives up Knesset seat in protest...	Two months after being fired as Defense Minister, Likud MK Yoav Gallant resigns from the Knesset, castigating the Netanyahu government for promoting new draft law maintaining the status quo on army deferments for ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News MK Yoav Gallant, former defense minister of Israel who was fired from the Netanyahu government on November 5th, resigned from the Knesset Wednesday. Gallant announced the end of his Knesset term in a press conference Wednesday night, while protesting the government’s contentious draft bill, which would maintain the policy of granting annual draft deferments to full-time yeshiva students. 'I will soon submit my decision to end my role in the 25th Knesset, after 45 years of service and mission,' Gallant said. 'Thirty-five years in the IDF, a decade as a member of Knesset, and a minister in Israeli governments, including two dramatic years as defense minister. As a member of the Likud party, I will continue to fight for the movement's path,' Gallant added, hinting that he will remain active within the ruling party. A former Major General in the IDF and chief of the army’s Southern Command, Gallant first entered politics in 2015, running on the centrist Kulanu ticket. When the party merged with the Likud in 2019, Gallant was guaranteed a spot on the Likud list. Serving at the helm of various ministries in several Netanyahu governments, Gallant was given the fourth slot on the Likud list ahead of the 2022 elections, and was later appointed Minister of Defense. During his term as Defense Minister, Gallant frequently clashed with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who initially removed Gallant from his government in March 2023 over Gallant’s public opposition to the judicial reform plan, before walking back the move. Gallant drew sharp criticism from members of the Netanyahu government for his handling of the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, leading to his firing in early November. Throughout his term, Gallant also expressed opposition to the government’s efforts to pass new legislation reinstating draft deferments for yeshiva students, after the previous law was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2017. After the Hamas invasion of October 7th, Gallant openly defied the government, calling for large-scale conscription of ultra-Orthodox men. In his address Wednesday, Gallant reiterated his opposition to plans to preserve draft deferments for yeshiva students. 'The issue of the ultra-Orthodox draft is not only a social need - it's a strategic necessity,' Gallant said. 'Because I stood for the best interests of the IDF and Israel, I was ousted from my position as Defense Minister. The IDF needs every soldier, male and female. Reservists and regular soldiers will be required for a very long service.' 'Since I was pushed away, nothing has stopped. [The government is] promoting a draft law that is against Israel's security. The bill is intended to grant a military exemption to most of the young men in the ultra-Orthodox sector. I can't be a partner to this.' Gallant also defended his criticism of the judicial reform, saying that the controversial plan led to social division which constituted a 'tangible and real danger to the security of the State of Israel.' With his resignation from the Knesset, Abed Afif, a Druze member of the Likud party, is now poised to take Gallant’s seat.

Israeli commandos destroyed missile factory in Syria in just 20 m...	The IDF: 'This operation stands as one of the IDF's most audacious and perilous commando missions conducted beyond Israel's borders.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel is taking responsibility for a complex commando mission to destroy an advanced missile-producing facility in Syria in September, Ynet reports. IAF's Shaldag Unit and Unit 669 targeted a facility in Masyaf, Syria, built to surface-to-surface missiles with Iranian technology intended for the Syrian army and Hezbollah. The Iran-funded Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center (CERS) developed a facility using planetary mixers, which combine components into a homogeneous compound for solid rocket fuel production. The planetary mixer technology can make missile production more covert and less detectable by intelligence and surveillance. Solid rocket fuel allows missiles to be discharged without on-site fueling, which would require them to be taken from underground, raised for over an hour, and risk detection. The facility, which was underground, carved into a mountainside, was discovered by Israeli intelligence gathered before and during the war, and the strike was made only after it was determined that the site was operational. The raid was carried out in September, when activity at the facility was minimal. It began with air strikes, which caused the guards to retreat underground. The IAF deployed Sea Stallion and Black Hawk helicopters at the facility's entrance, although there was no safe place to land. Some troops entered the facility and located the planetary missiles, whereas others planted explosives some distance away. The entire mission took 20 minutes, and when the commandos returned to the helicopter, the explosives were detonated, destroying the facility. The planetary mixers are available only to global powers and are relatively rare, with only a few remaining in the Shiite axis. Each mixer is worth $2 million, and it is estimated that it will take Iran two years to restore the facility. The IDF said of the mission, 'This operation stands as one of the IDF's most audacious and perilous commando missions conducted beyond Israel's borders. It was executed with remarkable heroism, facing numerous risks, yet meticulously planned by the IAF.' The statement continued, 'The operation achieved its objective: the crippling of Iran and Syria's strategic capabilities, accomplished over a distance of dozens of kilometers from Israeli territory.'

Survey reveals surge in Israeli support for Orthodox military con...	The war against Hamas, approaching its 15th month, has stretched the army’s manpower needs, sharpening the national debate. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli public is shifting decisively in favor of integrating Orthodox Jews into military service, according to a survey presented by the Israel Democracy Institute at its conference on Tuesday. The survey, which sampled 756 Israelis aged 18 and older during November found growing dissatisfaction with current exemptions for the Haredi community and heightened support for conscription. The poll revealed that only 9% of Israelis now support the current arrangement exempting Haredim from military service, a steep decline from 22% ten months earlier. In contrast, support for comprehensive or partial conscription of ultra-Orthodox individuals has surged to 84.5%, up from 67% in January. Half of the respondents favor drafting all young Haredim with rare exemptions, while 34.5% back an allotment system coupled with economic penalties for non-compliance. 'The data clearly shows a sea change in public opinion,' said Shlomit Ravitzky Tur-Paz, director of IDI’s Jacobs Center for Shared Society. 'The growing support for conscription reflects broader societal demands for equity and shared responsibility.' Support for Haredi conscription has also grown markedly among the National Religious population. In November, 72.5% endorsed some form of Haredi enlistment, doubling from 36.5% in January. Simultaneously, support for the existing exemptions within this group plummeted from 44% to 18%. Opinions within the Religious Zionist camp are split: 39.5% favor an allotment system, while 33% advocate for drafting all Haredi individuals except for a select few exceptional yeshiva students. 'We are witnessing a pivotal moment,' said former President Reuven Rivlin. 'October 7th proved to us all, whether we like it or not, that we can live as ‘tribes’ only if we have a state that supports all of us. A state that can protect us in terms of security and provide us with all those things a proper society provides.' The Haredi community largely opposes conscription, with 61% supporting the status quo. Only 20% of ultra-Orthodox respondents favor any form of enlistment, while 19% remain undecided. 'We are always discussing tolerating Haredim,' said MK Yitzhak Pindrus of the United Torah Judaism party. 'Perhaps it’s the Haredim who are tolerating those who are different from their community?' The war against Hamas, approaching its 15th month, has stretched the army’s manpower needs, sharpening the national debate. Among non-Haredi Jewish Israelis, 81% now support revisiting conscription policies for Haredim, up from 65% in January. This sentiment spans various levels of religiosity, with secular support reaching 90%, traditional non-religious at 80%, traditional religious at 66%, and religious individuals rising significantly from 41% to 64.5%. However, the Haredi community largely resists this shift. A majority (57%) argue that the heightened security demands should not influence their conscription policy, while 21.5% believe otherwise. Perceptions of the Haredi community’s contribution to the war effort have deteriorated, the survey found. In January, 46% of non-Haredi Jewish Israelis believed Haredim contributed meaningfully; by November, this dropped to 35%. Secular Israelis, in particular, express skepticism, with only 25% acknowledging significant Haredi contributions, down from 32%. 'The gaps are often very large, and the solutions seem far from reach,' said Ravitzky Tur-Paz. 'But we must take the first steps, which include speaking openly and honestly, looking each other in the eye, and progressing together towards a solution.' Prominent figures at the conference stressed the importance of fostering unity across Israeli society. 'October 7th proved to us all, whether we like it or not, that we can live as ‘tribes’ only if we have a state that supports all of us. A state that can protect us in terms of security and provide us with all those things a proper society provides. We must see ourselves as part of the cogent state, even while we live alongside one another as communities,' said former Israeli president Reuven Rivlin. The Israel Defense Forces began making plans to draft yeshiva students after Israel’s High Court of Justice ruled in June that exemptions for the Haredi community were illegal. The issue has not been resolved and is contributing to a coalition crisis that forced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to leave the hospital over the advice of his doctors to cast his vote on government legislation on Tuesday. Military service is compulsory for all Israeli citizens. However, Israel’s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, and the country’s leading rabbis agreed to a status quo that deferred military service for Haredi men studying in yeshivot, or religious institutions. At the time, no more than several hundred men were studying in yeshivot. However, the Orthodox community has grown significantly since Israel’s founding. In January 2023, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported that Haredim are Israel’s fastest-growing community and projected it would constitute 16% of the population by the end of the decade. According to the Israel Democracy Institute, the number of yeshiva students exceeded 138,000 in 2021.

‘It’s devastating’: Northern Israelis hesitate to rebuild lives a...	Less than 3,000 of Kiryat Shmona's 28,000 residents have returned, transforming the once-bustling streets into a ghost town. By Anna Epshtein, TPS Midway through a temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah, residents of northern Israel are still reluctant to return to their homes. Some residents of Kiryat Shmona and Metula told The Press Service of Israel they are not convinced that the threat of Hezbollah has been eliminated. Others told TPS-IL they like their new lives in central Israel better or were struggling to deal with government bureaucracy to begin rebuilding. 'Some 15 percent of the city’s population already made up their minds that they will not return,' Yehuda Haim, Kiryat Shmona’s deputy mayor told TPS-IL. Haim owns several tire services in the area and was checking in one of them. 'I saw it and I wanted to run from there,' he confessed to TPS-IL. 'It’s depressing. There’s mold on the walls, rats that inhabited the place… I totally understand the people who came to see their houses after a year and do not want to return.' Inside Kiryat Shmona, the streets are mostly empty resembling a ghost town in most neighborhoods. The signs of destruction are not as visible compared to nearby communities like Metula and Kibbutz Manara. A shopping mall’s parking lot is full of cars, and while many shops have reopened, the cafes have not. ‘There is no place like home,' a sign reads. But there are hardly any shoppers. Of the city’s 28,000 residents, less than 3,000 have returned. Most of the mall’s visitors are from nearby towns, or taking advantage of the ceasefire to check in on their property before leaving. 'My daughter wanted to find something in her room, but she just entered the house and rushed back,' Hannie Gillian told TPS-IL while looking for clothes in one of the shops. 'It’s devastating to see your home being turned into ruins.' Gillian’s house in the nearby town of Metula was destroyed after taking a direct rocket hit. The family is renting an apartment in Safed. Gillian said she wants to return to Metula but has not received any information from authorities on compensation that would enable the family to rebuild. 'We are at war with Hezbollah, but also with the government for the compensation,' she said. One of the few businesses that managed to stay open during the entire war was a pet store that served residents of nearby towns. 'People are afraid to return,' said the store owner who did not want to provide his name to TPS-IL. 'The ceasefire has been holding so far, but it’s not enough. They want to see what happens once the army leaves Lebanon in a month.' Igal Ohayon remained alone in Kiryat Shmona while his family evacuated to Jerusalem. He works in the Har Odem winery in the Golan Heights, and the war broke out during the grape harvesting season. 'Wine is this kind of business that cannot wait – if you abandon it, you ruin it,' he explained to TPS-IL. 'The place needed me, so I stayed.' He says many of his friends from the city do now want to come back from where they live now as evacuees. 'Life is better in the center of the country. Education, medicine, entertainment… After experiencing it, they do not want to return to the north,' Ohayon said. David Kamari, who did not evacuate, told TPS-IL, 'Only people who do not have a choice have returned.' Asked why he didn’t evacuate, Kamari shrugged and said, 'You don’t leave home.' Kamari’s house was hit by shrapnel from rockets while he was inside. He sleeps in the house’s old safe room, the only room where the roof is not in danger of falling. After the house was damaged, he moved his sofa and table to the yard for an outdoor salon. Kamari was already using the yard as a hot food distribution center for other Kiryat Shmona residents who stayed. Unlike in the south of Israel, where the Tekuma (‘Rehabilitation’) Directorate of the Israeli government was created just two weeks after the October 7 attack and around 53,000 out of 64,000 evacuated residents living near the Gaza border have either returned to their homes or are living in nearby temporary housing, northern rehabilitation has not yet begun. In December, the government allocated 15 billion shekels for reviving of the north ($4.1 billion), compared to 19 billion shekels ($5.2 billion) allocated to the south and the 31 billion shekels ($8.4 billion) that northern communities requested. The money is meant to be spent over five years, but government bureaucracy has prevented the money from reaching the local level. Asked about the budget, Deputy Mayor Haim said, 'It’s a joke. I am not sure it’s enough for rehabilitating Kiryat Shmona alone.' He explained, 'There were tanks driving through the streets of the city, damaging the infrastructure. It needs to be replaced. If a rocket hit a road, the government would only pay for patching the crater. But if you have several craters on a road, within a year the road becomes uneven like a roller coaster. So you need to build a new road, not patch the craters.' He said young people are not eager to return to Kiryat Shmona because there wasn’t much to keep them there even before October 7. 'Here, we see the result of 40 years of abandonment. There is no hospital, not a single cinema in the city,' Haim said. 'You cannot bring back the residents by returning the north to what it was on October 6. You need to make a dramatic change here, or you lose it.'

Senior IDF officer: Key positions in Lebanon vital to safeguardin...	Plans are also underway to construct an advanced border barrier, featuring anti-vehicle measures and inspired by recent Syrian border upgrades, to address evolving security threats. By Joshua Marks and Amelie Botbol, JNS A senior IDF Northern Command officer, in closed discussions on Tuesday, stressed the importance of maintaining strategic positions in Lebanon to protect the Galilee panhandle town of Metula and the northern border. These positions would leverage elevated locations for tactical and defensive advantages against Hezbollah attacks, including long-range fire, Israel Hayom reported the officer as saying. Metula, the northernmost town in Israel, north of Kiryat Shmona, is in ruins after the 13-month war with Iran’s Lebanese terrorist proxy Hezbollah, with more than 60% of its homes damaged by rocket fire. MK Avigdor Liberman, head of the Yisrael Beiteinu Party, told JNS on Tuesday that the IDF should not withdraw from Lebanon until the Lebanese Army fully deploys along the border, Hezbollah ceases its activities near Israel, and its weapons are eliminated. Until then, 'the IDF is not allowed to move a single millimeter,' he said. A home that was hit by a Lebanese missile in Metula, in the Galilee panhandle, Nov. 27, 2024.

Hezbollah launched some 16,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel since joining the war in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the Gaza-based terrorist organization’s massacre in southern Israel. Nearly 70,000 residents were internally displaced as 43 communities near the Lebanese border were evacuated. According to the Alma Research and Education Center, which monitors the northern fronts, 45 Israeli civilians and 83 IDF soldiers were killed during the war, which ended when a 60-day ceasefire took hold on Nov. 27. The Israeli Finance Ministry estimates that property damage along the northern border has reached 1.5 billion shekels ($410 million). Additionally, indirect damages in Israeli communities near the border are projected to total between 3.5 billion and 4 billion shekels ($960 million-$1.1 billion). Plans are also underway to construct an advanced border barrier, featuring anti-vehicle measures and inspired by recent Syrian border upgrades, to address evolving security threats.

Religious Zionism Party Knesset member Ohad Tal underscored the need to protect Israeli citizens and enforce agreements preventing Hezbollah from rearming or remaining south of the Litani River. 'What we should do is fulfill the promise we made to our people by allowing them to return to their homes safely without any threat coming from Lebanon,' Tal told JNS on Tuesday. 'The [ceasefire] agreement says Hezbollah cannot go back to the Litani river, rearm, get weapons from Iran. If it’s fulfilled, we can leave, but as long as we see that they are trying to rearm themselves we will have to stay and make sure they don’t pose a threat to our citizens,' he said. 'It’s very hard to predict what will happen. On one hand, we have to remember that Hezbollah is a radical terror organization with one goal, which is to destroy the one and only Jewish state. I don’t think that they will give up their desire to do so,' Tal said. 'On the other hand, they do understand that they are weak, their leadership was destroyed, they lost most of their ammunition and many of their officers and manpower. They also know that Iran is in a time of weakness and can’t back them, Syria is no longer part of their coalition. They are much more isolated, weaker and maybe they’ll give up,' he added. 'This might lead them to maintain a situation where the ceasefire is kept. If not, we will have to act and make sure the agreement is respected and that they will no longer pose a threat to our citizens,' Tal said.

Meanwhile, Lebanese villages near the border remain heavily affected by the war, with displaced residents and slow reconstruction efforts. As the ceasefire nears its end in three and a half weeks, Israeli forces remain on high alert, prepared to resume operations if Hezbollah initiates further hostilities. Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli forces are supposed to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon, where they have been operating since early October. As the IDF withdraws, Lebanese Army and United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) forces are required to enter these areas and ensure that Hezbollah retreats north of the Litani River, located some 18 miles north of the border with Israel. The United States and France are overseeing compliance by receiving regular updates from diplomats and military officials. Israeli troops continue to find massive weapons caches and terrorist infrastructure in Southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah has repeatedly violated the truce, with the Alma Center on Dec. 30 recording 99 ceasefire violations since Nov. 27. Hezbollah weapons found in southern Lebanon. (Twitter Screenshot) Military sources emphasized to Israel Hayom that while post-ceasefire operations in Lebanon depend on political decisions, the IDF is prepared to secure the northern border by any means necessary. The IDF is monitoring agreement compliance via U.S. intermediaries and sharing intelligence with Lebanese forces, though assessments indicate Lebanon may struggle to meet deployment requirements due to resource limitations and competing priorities, especially on the Syrian border. Mahmoud Qamati, a member of parliament in Beirut and the deputy head of Hezbollah’s political council, told Hezbollah-affiliated Al Manar television on Monday that 'our patience extends 60 days. Day 61 brings change. Forces in Lebanon become occupiers, and we will respond accordingly.' Likud lawmaker Tsega Melaku highlighted to JNS on Tuesday that Israel’s conflict is with Hezbollah, not the Lebanese people, describing the group as an Iranian proxy aimed at Israel’s destruction. 'We don’t need Lebanese territory, and we don’t want to settle in Lebanon or live there, but we have to defend ourselves. In 2006, after the [Second Lebanon] War ended, the U.N. [Security Council] Resolution [1701] stipulated that the Lebanese side of the border with Israel would be defended by UNIFIL, but they didn’t help us,' she said. 'Everyone is losing in this war but especially the Lebanese people; the situation is bad. In the past, Arab countries especially the UAE supported Lebanon economically, but today it is not the case. Israel does not need to stay in Lebanon, but we have the right to protect ourselves,' Melaku said. 'Lebanon today is led by terrorist groups. The Lebanese regime doesn’t control its territory. Still now, Hezbollah’s army has a presence in Southern Lebanon, and I don’t think the ceasefire helps because they want to exterminate us and the Lebanese government is very weak,' she said. Hezbollah weapons facility and vehicle Israeli Air Force strikes targeted a weapons storage facility and a vehicle on Tuesday after soldiers observed Hezbollah terrorists transferring weapons to a vehicle in Southern Lebanon, the military said on Wednesday morning. אתמול, זוהו פעילים של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה מעבירים אמצעי לחימה ממחסן אמצעי לחימה בדרום לבנון לרכב סמוך. בסגירת מעגל מהירה הרכב ומחסן אמצעי הלחימה הותקפו מהאוויר להסרת האיום>> pic.twitter.com/b3ro9k2XMf &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) January 1, 2025 'The IDF is operating in accordance with the ceasefire understandings between Israel and Lebanon. The IDF remains deployed in Southern Lebanon and will operate against any threat to the State of Israel and its citizens,' it added. Hidden Hezbollah weapons The IDF on Tuesday night highlighted efforts by the 769th 'Hiram' Brigade, under the command of the 91st 'Galilee' Division, to dismantle Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure Southern Lebanon in line with the ceasefire agreement. Over the past week, Golani Brigade soldiers and Erez Program troops, operating under the 769th Brigade’s command in the Saluki region, conducted searches and uncovered a hidden weapons storage facility in difficult terrain. The facility contained a large cache of weaponry, including launchers, missiles and other explosive devices. During a subsequent raid on nearby structures, additional weapons were found, including missile launchers, explosives, dozens of AK-47 rifles, grenades, wire-guided missiles, mines, surveillance equipment, explosive devices and tactical combat gear. Troops dismantled the weapons storage facility and confiscated the armaments. The Erez Program (Unit 169) is an elite program for the training and development of combat commanders for IDF field units. It is named after Brig.-Gen. Erez Gerstein, who commanded the Lebanon Liaison Unit and died in an explosion in Southern Lebanon in March 1999.

New Orleans: 10 dead, 36 injured in apparent terror attack	New Orleans mayor declares combination ramming attack and shooting on New Year's Day was an act of terror, after 10 people killed and dozens more injured. By World Israel News Staff At least 10 people were killed and 36 more wounded in New Orleans early Wednesday morning, after a man driving a pickup truck rammed through New Year's revelers before opening fire on passersby. The incident occurred in the city's French Quarter, on Bourbon Street and Canal Street at approximately 3:15 a.m. Wednesday morning, when a male gunman driving a Ford F-150 and armed with an assault rifle rammed through a large crowd of pedestrians celebrating the new year. The driver exited the vehicle and opened fire on the crowd, prompting police officers at the scene to return fire. During the ensuing gun battle, the suspect was fatally wounded, despite wearing body armor according to eyewitnesses. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said the incident was 'very intentional,' and noted that he had shot and wounded two police officers during the gun battle. 'This man was trying to run over as many people as he possibly could.' 'It was not a DUI situation,' Kirkpatrick added, noting that the suspect had maneuvered around police barricades in order to reach the crowd, because he was 'hellbent on creating carnage.' While the area targeted for the attack is a popular tourist destination, Kirkpatrick said the victims were mostly locals. According to preliminary reports, FBI agents called to the scene found an improvised explosive device in the suspect's truck. Footage from the scene showed a bomb squad robot inspecting the underside of the suspect's vehicle. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell called the incident a 'terrorist attack.' While an FBI agent speaking on behalf of the agency initially denied the claim, the bureau is now investigating the incident as an act of terror, NBC News reported.

Illegal Palestinian resort threatens ancient Jewish palaces	Watchdog group warns that illegal Palestinian land grabs in Samaria are threatening archeological site featuring the ancient palaces of the Hasmonean dynasty. By World Israel News Staff A priceless archeological site, dating back two thousand years to the Hasmonean dynasty, is endangered by illegal Palestinian land grabs and unauthorized construction in Israeli-controlled portions of Samaria, a watchdog group warned. According to a report by the Regavim organization, which monitors illegal construction in the Arab sector, the archeological complex between Jerusalem and Jericho known as the Hasmonean Palaces is being encroached upon by Palestinian Arab construction in the area. Of particular concern is the expansion of an illegal Palestinian holiday resort. The resort’s sprawling complex, which includes luxury villas, an events compound, a swimming pool, and high-end guest accommodations, looms over the historical remains, sparking outrage among preservationists and community leaders. Situated near Nachal Prat (Wadi Qelt), the Hasmonean Palaces site is of profound historical and cultural significance. The area once served as the winter retreat for the Hasmonean royal family and features an array of archeological treasures, including one of the oldest synagogues ever discovered, ritual baths, and luxury amenities that exemplify the grandeur of the era. For archaeologists and historians, the site offers a unique window into Jewish life and governance during the Second Temple period. Over the past several years, state-owned lands in Area C - under full Israeli control - near the palaces have been subjected to significant unauthorized construction. Palestinian contractors have illegally built numerous luxury apartments and accompanying facilities, culminating in the establishment of the holiday resort, which is actively marketed on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Regavim described the situation as 'ruthless' Palestinian takeover, warning that the site's legacy is being sacrificed for commercial gain. 'A dream vacation at the expense of history,' the group decried in a statement. While some structures, including concrete fences, were demolished following complaints three years ago, construction has since resumed unchecked. Access to the archeological site is now obstructed, further exacerbating the crisis. Efforts to halt this illegal development face significant challenges, with local authorities struggling to enforce land-use regulations. Meanwhile, archaeologists and cultural preservation advocates urge swift action to safeguard the Hasmonean Palaces site from further damage, emphasizing its irreplaceable value to Jewish history and global heritage. 'The Palestinian Authority encourages and orchestrates Arab annexation of Area C - using methods that are trampling and destroying magnificent, unique heritage sites, the physical record of history that is a cultural and scientific asset of the Jewish people and the entire world,' said Binyamin Regional Council mayor and Yesha Council chairman Israel Ganz. 'The Civil Administration must enforce the law more rigorously and put an end to this travesty. It is inconceivable that the Jewish people abandon their national historical property in this way. We must re-establish our presence here, settle and stay here forever.'

Israel received over $22 billion in US military aid since Hamas i...	Swedish thinktank says US military support for Israel since October 7th has totalled more than $22 billion, with the US cementing its role as the primary exporter of arms to the Jewish state. By World Israel News Staff The United States supplied Israel's military with over $22 billion in equipment since October 7th, 2023, a Swedish-based thinktank reported this week. According to a report by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), between October 7th and December 2023, the U.S. had transferred over 10,000 tons of military equipment and munitions to the IDF, with an estimated value of $2.4 billion. By August of 2024, that figure had risen to 50,000 tons, with a value of $12 billion. The SIPRI report also showed a significant increase in the proportion of Israel's military imports coming from the United States, cementing America's role as the IDF's primary source of foreign arms. While 69% of foreign-made military equipment and munitions purchased by the IDF from 2019 to 2023 came from the United States, since October 2023, that figure has increased to 78%. American weapons transfers to Israel since October 7th, 2023, have included interceptor missiles for the Iron Dome missile defense network, various aerial munitions including guided bombs, CH-53 transport helicopters, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, 155mm artillery shells, bunker buster bombs, armored vehicles, and other equipment. According to the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations, the United States has given Israel over $310 billion in military and economic aid since the Jewish state's establishment, after adjusting for inflation. Currently, Israel receives an annual military aid package of $3.8 billion, as part of a ten-year memorandum of understanding penned by the Obama administration in 2016. In 2024, Congress approved emergency aid packages to Israel, including one package in February topping $14 billion, with $2.5 billion in weapon transfers in March, 2024. The report also found that Israel's domestic arms industry has flourished, with three Israeli companies ranking in the top 100 of arms manufacturers worldwide in terms of annual revenue.

Wars in Gaza, Lebanon taking toll on military discipline, IDF war...	Soldiers have uploaded videos to social media from combat zones, ignored safety rules and dressed improperly without suffering necessary consequences. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An IDF investigation has found that discipline is on the wane as the Israel-Hamas war drags on, due mostly to the operational attrition of various units, the army announced Wednesday after presenting its conclusions to the chief of staff. The in-depth inquiry, led by Maj. Gen. (res.) Moti Baruch, had the mandate to 'formulat[e] a detailed situational picture regarding the maintenance of operational discipline, the rules of conduct and norms&#8230; and the implementation of a proper military culture in combat units' fighting in the south in Gaza and in the north in Lebanon/Syria. The internal situation in the units fighting on the Judea and Samaria front was not examined. Operational and information security, perhaps the most important issue, has declined over time and such phenomena as the soldiers’ use of cellphones in the field, was not being as strictly denied as it had been. 'There were even cases where cellular devices were openly used in the combat zones,' the report stated, while noting that the problem was much more manifest in the southern than the northern fronts. Soldiers have even uploaded videos onto social media 'indicating the exact location of the units that operated there,' it said. Hamas intelligence could theoretically use this information to attack those IDF forces. Israeli intelligence has found vast documentation of the terror organization having gained invaluable data on the IDF from social media prior to its invasion and massacre last October 7 that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. The report also blamed the long months of war for the occurrence of military accidents. 'Due to the operational fatigue of the various units that have been in combat for over a year and three months, there was a loosening of discipline and safety in the various units, which manifested itself in the improper use of resources and led to operational accidents that could have been prevented,' it said. The breakdown in following safety rules included certain usages of weapons and explosives, and risky driving methods. The inquiry was prompted by a November incident in which a civilian researcher and tour guide, Ze'ev Ehrlich, was killed along with a soldier in Lebanon after officers allowed his unauthorized entry to examine an important archeological site and Hezbollah snipers shot them. When delving into the issue of the entry of civilians into battle zones, the investigators found only 'isolated' incidents of those who came in without permission and said that 'these cases are being examined and handled.' Other safety issues they examined included equipment donations units received from concerned Jews both at home and abroad, as well as the greater laxity of dress codes, where 'during the fighting a phenomenon of widespread non-compliance developed in all areas.' The report concluded with a string of recommendations to improve both discipline and safety, which were adopted on the spot by the chief of staff. These included immediately holding day-long seminars on the subjects and having periodic refresher courses during the war, while enforcing punishments for those violating the safety and discipline orders, as this will 'prevent accidents and safety incidents, save lives, and meet mission requirements.' Another recommendation was to transfer forces from sector to sector to prevent attrition. While most divisions have been rotated between the northern and southern fronts, this has not been the case for Division 162, for example, which has been fighting in the Gaza Strip for the entire duration of the war. The 11-officer team interviewed officers in combat units as well as generals, and talked to regular soldiers in the field, besides examining internal IDF reports on the issues.

No hostage before Trump inauguration – report	Arab mediators brokering talks between Israel and Hamas say that negotiations are now deadlocked, with no breakthrough likely before Trump takes office. By World Israel News Staff Hostage deal and ceasefire talks between Israel and the Hamas terror organization are deadlocked, Arab mediators say, after weeks of optimistic reports and claims that a breakthrough could be reached while President Joe Biden is still in office. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal published a report which cited multiple Arab officials involved in brokering talks in Doha, Qatar between Israel and Hamas. The mediators said that despite optimistic projections last month of an impending breakthrough, it now appears that a deal securing the release of hostages and a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip will not be reached before Biden leaves office. President-elect Donald Trump is set to be inaugurated on January 20th, and has repeatedly warned that Hamas will face consequences should it fail to release the remaining hostages by the time he takes office. On Tuesday, Trump reiterated his warning, saying: 'I’ll put it this way: they better let the hostages come back soon.' According to the Journal report, Hamas has withdrawn its offer to negotiate a temporary truce, and has resumed its demand that the hostage deal include a permanent ceasefire ending the war with Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly remained firm in his opposition to such an arrangement, and last week was quoted by multiple Hebrew media outlets as telling Israel's negotiating team that the IDF will resume fighting in Gaza after any potential ceasefire, adding that Israel should be open about its intentions to continue the war. Israel's delegation returned from talks in Doha late last month for consultations in Israel, after Hamas walked back its willingness to compromise on key issues, including its demand that the IDF withdraw from the entire Gaza Strip in the third and final stage of a ceasefire. Talks have concentrated on a possible two-month truce, split into three stages, with some 30-34 hostages to be released during the initial phase, in exchange for the freeing of hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists.

US imposes sanctions on entities in Iran, Russia over election in...	The United States will remain vigilant against adversaries who would undermine our democracy,' said Treasury official Bradley Smith. By The Algemeiner and Reuters The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on entities in Iran and Russia, accusing them of attempting to interfere in the 2024 US election. The US Treasury Department said in a statement the entities — a subsidiary of Iran‘s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and an organization affiliated with Russia’s military intelligence agency (GRU) — aimed to 'stoke socio-political tensions and influence the US electorate during the 2024 US election.' 'The governments of Iran and Russia have targeted our election processes and institutions and sought to divide the American people through targeted disinformation campaigns,' Treasury’s Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley Smith, said in the statement. 'The United States will remain vigilant against adversaries who would undermine our democracy.' Iran‘s mission to the United Nations in New York and Russia’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Republican Donald Trump was elected president in November, beating Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House. The Treasury said the Cognitive Design Production Center planned influence operations since at least 2023 designed to incite tensions among the electorate on behalf of the IRGC. The Treasury accused the Moscow-based Center for Geopolitical Expertise (CGE) of circulating disinformation about candidates in the election as well as directing and subsidizing the creation of deepfakes. The Treasury said CGE also manipulated a video to produce 'baseless accusations concerning a 2024 vice presidential candidate.' It did not specify which candidate was targeted. The Moscow-based center, at the direction of the GRU, used generative AI tools to quickly create disinformation distributed across a network of websites that were designed to look like legitimate news outlets, the Treasury said. It accused the GRU of providing financial support to CGE and a network of US-based facilitators in order to build and maintain its AI-support server and maintain a network of at least 100 websites used in its disinformation operations. CGE’s director was also hit with sanctions in Tuesday’s action. An annual US threat assessment released in October said the United States sees a growing threat of Russia, Iran, and China attempting to influence the elections, including by using artificial intelligence to disseminate fake or divisive information.

Barrett Media is a leading publishing and consulting company, providing daily coverage of radio, television, and digital brands in the sports, news, and music media industries. By John Hasten, JNS New York conservative radio talk show host Sid Rosenberg was recognized on Monday by Barrett Media president and founder Jason Barrett the a 'Best of 2024—news/talk radio host.' Rosenberg broadcast his top-rated morning show, 'Sid & Friends in the Morning,' live to his 77 WABC audience from the JNS studios in Jerusalem during two visits to Israel in 2024, and plans on returning to the Jewish state for more shows in April. .@sportsradiopd released his 'Best of 2024' for news media this morning. More in today's column including details about the 2025 host city for the BNM Summit. pic.twitter.com/ohQ15xnKNc &mdash; Barrett Media (@Barrett_Media) December 30, 2024 'This recognition is huge,' Rosenberg told JNS. 'There are thousands of radio hosts across the country, some really big names out there, and they pick one. Barrett’s is the industry standard. They cover us on their website about three times a week throughout the year, and for them to single me out, and my show, it is a big honor.' He continued, 'Looking back at 2024, there were so many big moments for the show. President-elect Donald Trump was on the show five times, and people will always remember my remarks at the Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City, just a few days before the election. 'Trump played a huge role in our success, but honestly I believe our two trips to Israel, in January, and then in October, for the one-year commemoration of the October 7 massacre, those are the pivotal reasons this show gained national success,' Rosenberg said. He elaborated, 'On October 7, 2024, while broadcasting from Sderot, Israel, we had President Trump on the phone for 28 minutes, where he expressed his love for Israel and the Jewish people. We also met with President [Isaac] Herzog, and broke the Yom Kippur fast with Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu. All of this within a span of six days. So my connection to Israel, thanks to our friends at the One Israel Fund organization, is the biggest reason we had such great success in 2024.' Barrett Media is a leading publishing and consulting company, providing daily coverage of radio, television and digital brands in the sports, news and music media industries. Rosenberg was also quick to attribute his show’s success to his live broadcasts from the JNS studio. 'On those two trips, in January, and October, we broadcast eight shows. Six out of the eight came from the JNS studios in Jerusalem. So you at JNS should take a bow as well for this recognition.' Rosenberg said that he is excited for what 2025 will bring, including attending and covering Trump’s inauguration in Washington on Jan. 20, two live shows from the Super Bowl in New Orleans in February, and his trip to Israel planned for April, surrounding Israel’s 77th Independence Day. 'We’re kicking off 2025 in a big way, and I’m looking forward to coming back to Israel. JNS and its CEO Alex Traiman are at the very center of my relationship, and the show’s relationship, with Israel. This upcoming trip is very exciting,' he said. Top show Barrett Media also saluted 'The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show,' as the 'Best of 2024—news/talk radio show.' This past month, co-host Clay Travis spent a week broadcasting from the JNS studio in Jerusalem, on a trip to Israel as a guest of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews. Travis told JNS he was grateful for the acknowledgement. 'It’s always an honor to be recognized, especially after such a critical election year. Buck and I left nothing on the field and had a blast in the process. We look forward to a winning season for America in ’25!'

Trump: Hamas ‘better let the hostages come back soon’ – or else	President-elect Trump reiterates his warning that Hamas will face serious consequences if it fails to release the hostages. By World Israel News Staff President-elect Donald Trump reiterated that Hamas will face serious consequences should they fail to release the hostages before he returns to office. Speaking to a reporter during a New Year's Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Trump confirmed that the terror group would be wise to free the 100 hostages it has been holding for more than a year, including seven Americans. When a journalist asked if Trump stood behind his threats to the terror group, the incoming president doubled-down on his previous warnings. 'I’ll put it this way: they better let the hostages come back soon,' Trump said. Asked about a potential ceasefire between Hamas and Israel before he takes office, Trump said 'we’re gonna see what happens.' On New Year’s Eve at Mar-A-Lago Trump states that, 'They better let the hostages come back soon.'pic.twitter.com/ZzmfAuJGUp &mdash; Eyal Yakoby (@EYakoby) January 1, 2025 Trump issued a stark threat to the Hamas terror group in early December, via his Truth Social platform. 'If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity,' the post read. In December, Trump met with freed Israeli-American hostage Judith Ranaan on his golf course in Florida. According to a summary of the meeting published by Bring Them Home Now on X, Ranaan’s main message to Trump was that she 'trusts him.' She also asked that Trump 'do everything in his power to bring all the hostages home – the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial.' Also in December, the daughter of two slain hostages slammed President Joe Biden and other world leaders, saying that president-elect Donald Trump’s tweet threatening the Hamas terror group should have served as an example for the international community. 'All world leaders should have done on October 8, 2023, what Trump did in his tweet,' Iris Weinstein Haggai told the Times of Israel, referencing the president-elect’s pledge that there would be 'hell to pay' for Hamas if they do not release the hostages in the near future. Weinstein Haggai's parents, who hold Israeli, American, and Canadian citizenship, were brutally murdered in the October 7th terror rampage. Their bodies were kidnapped by Hamas. It’s unclear how many of the 100 hostages in captivity are still alive. At least 34 of the captives are confirmed to be dead.

Hamas rings in New Year with rocket fire on Israel’s south	Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip fire on Israel's south for sixth consecutive day; none hurt in attack. By World Israel News Staff Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip marked the arrival of 2025 by firing rockets at civilian communities in Israel's south, as the clock struck midnight. This is the second year in a row that Hamas rang in the new year by bombarding Israel. The attack occurred on the sixth consecutive day of rocket fire originating from the Strip. According to the IDF, the two rockets were launched from the central Gaza Strip. One rocket was intercepted by Israel's air defense systems, while the other struck an open area in Israel's south. The launches triggered sirens in the Western Negev city of Netivot and several nearby communities. Earlier on Tuesday afternoon, Hamas fired rockets at the Gaza adjacent-communities of Mivtahim, Ami'oz, and Yesha. On Tuesday morning, the terror group launched a projectile that caused sirens to sound in kibbutz Nir Am, one of the communities devastated by the terror onslaught. No casualties were reported from any of the attacks. An hour after the launches at midnight, IDF Arabic-language spokesman Col. Avichay Adraee published an evacuation warnings for residents of the al-Bureij in central Gaza on his official X account. 'Terrorist organizations are once again firing rockets from this area that has been warned several times in the past,' Adaree wrote. 'For your own safety, move immediately to the humanitarian zone.' Last Saturday, Hamas fired two long-range rockets at Jerusalem, setting off sirens in the capital city and nearby suburbs. Despite being severely battered by the IDF after some 14 months of fighting, Hamas has ramped up its attacks against Israel in recent days. The uptick in launches comes on the heels of reports that negotiations for a hostage deal and ceasefire between Israel and the terror group have stalled.

IDF eliminates Hamas Nukhba terrorist who led invasion of kibbutz...	Not only did Sabah lead the invasion on Nir Oz, but they also launched many attacks against IDF troops. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF and the IAF announced they eliminated the Nukhbah terrorist commander Abd al-Hadi Sabah, who led the invasion of Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, Arutz Sheva reports. Abd al-Hadi Sabah was a Platoon commander in the Western Khan Younis Battalion who operated from a 'humanitarian' area in Gaza. Not only did Sabah lead the invasion on Nir Oz, but they also launched many attacks against IDF troops. Before the strike that eliminated Sabah, the IDF said it took precautions to avoid civilian casualties using precise intelligence and aerial surveillance. The IDF said in a statement, 'The IDF and ISA will persist in targeting all terrorists involved in the brutal October 7 massacre.' Representatives from Kibbutz Nir Oz said in a statement, 'The elimination of the Nukhba platoon commander, responsible for leading the invasion of Nir Oz, is a step toward justice. However, true justice will only be realized when the hostages are safely returned home.' The IDF and IAF have been successful in eliminating Nukhba terrorists who took part in the October 7th invasion and massacre. In October, in a joint effort by the IDF, Israel's security agency (Shin Bet), and the IAF, the commander in charge of the October 7 attack on the bomb shelter close to the Nova music festival was eliminated. The IDF reported that Mohammad Abu Itiwi was a Nukhba commander in the Al Bureij Battalion of Hamas's Central Camps Brigade. Itiwi led the attack on the bomb shelter on Route 232 in the area of Re'im in southern Israel. Itiwi led many other terror attacks against Israelis, and his name appears on a list of employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). In September, two brothers who were involved in Hamas's October 7 massacre were eliminated in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF reported that Suleiman Abu-Lafi and his brother, Abdullah, were killed in Rafah last week. Suleiman had been smuggling weapons and coordinating terror attacks in Judea and Samaria from Gaza. Abdullah was a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Both brothers participated in the October 7 attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border. In a separate airstrike, another Hamas Nukhba Force commander, who also took part in the October 7 massacre, was killed.

Oct. 7 heroes honored at Knesset Chanukah ceremony	Never give up and continue fighting for our country, continue fighting for the hostages and for the wounded,' said Mishel Rukavisin, a female officer who was critically injured on Oct. 7. By Amelie Botbol, JNS Israelis who fought Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, along with survivors of the massacre and parliamentarians, took part on Monday in a Chanukah candle-lighting ceremony at the Knesset in Jerusalem. The ceremony was presided over by Iris Haim, whose son, Yotam, was one of three hostages misidentified as Hamas terrorists and accidentally killed a year ago on Dec. 15 by Israel Defense Forces troops in the Gaza Strip. Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana presented certificates of appreciation to six heroes, including Mishel Rukavisin, a female officer at the IDF’s base in the border community of Kissufim, who was critically injured on Oct. 7 and underwent a long rehabilitation process.

'It was important for me that people get to know my story, as there weren’t so many women [soldiers] hurt,' Rukavisin told JNS on Monday. 'I want people to know this and the fact that, even 15 months after the massacre, there are people still wounded and fighting for their lives.' Rukavisin, who arrived at the event in a wheelchair, but insisted on standing to receive her certificate from Ohana, said, 'Never give up and continue fighting for our country. Continue fighting for the hostages and for the wounded.' In the near future, Rukavisin, whose boyfriend recently proposed to her, plans to get back on her feet, literally, and tell the whole world her story. JNS also met with the family and friends of Maj. (res.) Yedidia Bloch, who died from injuries sustained on the battlefield in Southern Lebanon, and whose organs were donated to save seven lives. 'I was one of them,' Meytal Finder Izhak told JNS. 'I received half of his liver; the rest was given to a boy. It saved our lives. It shows that something good can come out of even the most horrible and painful things.' Yedidya’s two-week-old son was on stage when his father’s certificate was presented to the family.

Also honored were Yair Wisner, a member of the civilian defense squad of Kibbutz Kerem Shalom, who was seriously injured by an RPG on Oct. 7, as well as Ben Ladani, a member of the IDF’s Oketz canine unit, who enlisted from South Africa and was wounded in Jabalia. His dog perished in battle. Zohar Kochavi, who survived the Supernova music festival but was wounded twice during his reserve service, was also honored, along with Rimon Kedem, an 18-year-old resident of Kibbutz Be’eri, who survived the Oct. 7 invasion after his house was set on fire.

Israeli to be indicted for spying on Gantz for Iran	He is also accused of committing acts of arson, setting fire to eight vehicles, in incidents across the country. By JNS Prosecutors plan to indict a resident of a suburb of Tel Aviv on charges of spying for Iran on former Defense Minister Benny Gantz, according to information cleared for publication on Monday. Alexander Granovsky, 29, from Petach Tikvah, is accused of photographing infrastructure sites in central Israel and planning to photograph for Iran the entrance to the Neve Afek neighborhood in Rosh Ha’ayin where Gantz, who is chairman of the National Unity Party, lives. The former defense minister’s home address is not secret and can be found on Google, along with detailed pictures of the street where he lives and his neighborhood. Granovsky is also alleged to have provided information about another Israeli to assess that person’s potential for recruitment for terrorist activities. Granovsky, who has a criminal record, allegedly committed acts of vandalism for Iran in addition to the surveillance of Gantz. He was involved in psychological warfare operations, including vandalism, graffiti against the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and bought IDF uniforms to set them on fire for an online video, Israel Hayom reported. He is further accused of committing acts of arson, setting fire to eight vehicles in incidents across the country. Authorities claim he spray-painted the phrase 'Children of Ruhollah,' a reference to an Iranian espionage operation named after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the first supreme leader of the Islamic Republic. 'I need money. The Iranians pay, I execute,' he reportedly told interrogators. Granovsky allegedly began working for the Iranians in November, receiving several hundred shekels per action. Granovsky’s handlers discussed obtaining weapons, including rifles and grenades, and tasked him with gathering information on the home addresses of Israeli ministers. He was also allegedly asked to set fire to police vehicles and buses. The information, which had been the subject of a gag order, was cleared for publication after prosecutors filed a statement saying an indictment was expected in the coming days at the Central District Court in Lod. Granovsky is the latest of more than 30 Israelis arrested over the past year for allegedly carrying out missions for Iran. The alleged spies caught so far had limited access to classified materials, but their number is unprecedented, Israel Police Supt. Maor Goren, who oversees counterintelligence investigations, told CNN this month. 'If we go check the last years—the last decades—we can count on two hands how many people got arrested for this,' Goren said. The police arrested seven suspects in October whom they said belonged to one espionage cell.

Ignoring doctors’ warnings, Netanyahu leaves hospital early to vo...	Israeli prime minister cuts short his post-surgery hospitalization - despite the recommendations of his doctors who urged him to remain under observation. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu briefly appeared in the Knesset plenum on Tuesday for a critical vote, over the objections of doctors. Netanyahu is recovering from prostate surgery on Sunday night. He was accompanied to the plenum by his personal physician, Dr. Tzvi Berkowitz. Another coalition MK, Boaz Bismuth of Likud, was also brought to the Knesset despite being in a week of mourning for his mother. Two parties in Israel’s governing coalition are threatening to vote against Knesset legislation if their demands are not met, which could jeopardize efforts to pass the 2025 state budget. The crisis stems from dissent within the coalition itself. The United Torah Judaism party said it would vote against the 'Trapped Profits Law' as a warning over the government’s failure to advance legislation exempting Haredim, or Orthodox Jewish citizens, from military service. The bill would enable the government to tax 'trapped profits,' earnings retained by corporations and multinationals for reinvestment in business growth, infrastructure, and research. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is recovering from prostate surgery, attempted to mediate from his hospital bed, speaking with UTJ leader, Housing and Construction Minister Rabbi Yitzhak Goldknopf. The latter insisted that without progress on the draft exemption law, the party, which controls seven Knesset seats, would maintain its opposition. Social debate over Haredi national service has become more heated in recent months. The Israel Defense Forces began making plans to draft yeshiva students after Israel’s High Court of Justice ruled in June that exemptions for the Haredi community were illegal. Also dissenting is the Otzma Yehudit party led by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Ben-Gvir demands an increased budget for the police, prison service, and firefighting agencies, and has vowed to vote against the bill until his demands are addressed. The party has six seats. Adding to the uncertainty are the intentions of Likud MK Yoav Gallant, who was dismissed as Defense Minister in November, and Deputy Minister Avi Maoz of the Noam party. With Netanyahu’s hospitalization, the coalition only has the support of 57 Knesset members. If the government cannot muster the support of additional MKs, the vote will likely be postponed. Failure to pass the bill could jeopardize approval of the state budget later, or potentially create a 10-billion-shekel deficit ($2.74 billion). By law, the Knesset must pass a budget by March 31 or the government will automatically fall, triggering national elections.

Israel’s Jewish majority continues to shrink as ultra-Orthodox bi...	On New Year's Eve, Israel's population stands at just over 10 million, with the Jewish majority continuing to shrink, fueled in part by a drop in the ultra-Orthodox birthrate. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's population at the end of 2024 stood at just over 10 million, according to a report released by the country's Central Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday. On New Year's Eve, Israel is home to some 10,027,000 people, the report said, up from roughly 9,915,000 at the end of 2023. Overall, the population grew by just 1.12% over the last 365 days, down from an annual growth rate of 1.6% a year earlier, and 2.2% the year before that. The country's Jewish majority continues to shrink, with the category of 'Jews and Others' falling from 77.0% one year ago to 76.9%, or 7.707 million out of 10.027 million residents total. Israel's Arab population grew as a percentage of the overall population, rising from 20.8% at the end of 2023 to 21.0% on the eve of 2025, with 2.104 million Arab-Israelis. There are also 216,000 foreign nationals living in Israel. Of the 181,000 live births in Israel in 2024, 76% were to mothers in the 'Jewish and Others' category, which includes non-Jewish immigrants who moved to Israel under the Law of Return. Virtually all of the remaining 24% of births were to Arab mothers. The number of births rose slightly in 2024, from 178,724 the previous year. Approximately 51,400 people died in Israel over the past year. The sharp decline in Israel's total growth rate, from 2.2% in 2022 and 1.6% in 2023 to 1.1%, resulted primarily from a negative net migration rate over the last year. During 2024, 82,700 Israeli citizens moved abroad, while just 23,800 moved back to Israel. In the same year, a total of 32,800 new immigrants moved to Israel, 15,000 less than in 2023. The slowing of Israel's growth rate was also fueled in part by the continuing decline of the ultra-Orthodox birthrate. While the total fertility rate (TFR), representing the average number of children born to ultra-Orthodox or haredi women during their lifetimes, peaked in the mid-2000s at 7.5, that figure fell to 6.5 by 2021. According to a report published recently by The Haredi institute for Public Affairs, the haredi TFR has fallen to just 6.1, the lowest level recorded since the early 1980s. However, that figure remains significantly higher than the overall TFR for non-haredi Jewish women in Israel, estimated at 2.5.

Israel cannot again leave Gazan areas for months	Prolonged absence allows terrorist organizations to regroup, rearm and refine their tactics, leading to greater risks and higher costs when security must eventually be restored. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS The Israeli military’s extensive operations in northern Gaza over the past few months and the terrorist infrastructure that it uncovered make one thing clear: Leaving areas in Gaza without sustained security operations for extended periods invites Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) to move back in, ultimately increasing the cost of restoring order. The 162nd Division of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which entered Jabalia in mid-October 2024 after an eight-month absence, has faced newly entrenched Hamas and PIJ networks, exposing the consequences of prolonged inactivity in the region. While the IDF was previously stretched along two fronts, Lebanon and Gaza, should the ceasefire in the north continue to hold, Israel will be able to mobilize sufficient forces southwards to prevent such an outcome again. New recruits, new human shields During the eight months leading up to the 162nd Division’s return to Jabalia Hamas and the PIJ took full advantage of the IDF’s absence to reestablish their infrastructure for recruitment, training, and operational planning. According to military sources, Hamas has recruited untrained individuals, paying them to join its ranks and equipping them with basic weaponry, including AK-47s and RPGs. These recruits, though minimally skilled and instructed to attack IDF units on sight, are willing to engage in dangerous missions, posing serious threats to Israeli forces. The operational vacuum also allowed Hamas to strengthen its control over civilian areas and transform critical infrastructure into military assets. IDF International Spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani highlighted the extent of Hamas’s militarization efforts at the Kamal Adwan Hospital. Despite repeated warnings and operations in 2023 and earlier in 2024, terrorists operated command centers from within the medical facility, stored weapons there, and used patients and staff as human shields. The area was heavily booby-trapped, with explosives and anti-tank weaponry posing a significant threat to advancing IDF forces. Over 240 terrorists were apprehended in and around the hospital in the IDF’s latest operation. Many of them attempted to escape disguised as patients or using ambulances, while others were caught with weapons such as grenades and RPGs. According to IDF data, terrorists who participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel, including senior operatives, were among those neutralized and captured during the current ongoing operations in Jabalia. They had been consolidating control, hoping to turn the city into a heavily fortified stronghold as part of an unyielding strategy to exploit civilian cover. Hamas’s hope was to lay the foundations for rebuilding its terror army and once again threaten the people of Sderot and Gaza-envelope communities in Israel’s western Negev region with rockets, mortars and cross-border murder squads. The high cost of inaction The IDF’s ongoing campaign to clear Jabalia of terrorist elements has proven both time-consuming and costly. By mid-November, after significant progress in civilian evacuations to humanitarian zones, primarily Al-Mawasi on the southern Gaza coast, there were still a few thousand terrorists operating in the area. Currently, the IDF is dealing with the hundreds of terrorists who remain, demonstrating the scale of the challenge posed by a well-entrenched adversary. The IDF has paid a substantial price during these operations, with several soldiers killed in recent days. The bravery of the 162nd Division, including combat teams from the 401st Brigade, the Givati Brigade, and the Multi-Dimensional Unit, is a painful reminder of the burden Israel must bear when countering deeply embedded terrorist networks. The IDF’s current operations in Jabalia reveal a stark reality. Prolonged absence allows terrorist organizations to regroup, rearm and refine their tactics, leading to greater risks and higher costs when security must eventually be restored. The time and resources required to dismantle the Hamas and PIJ networks in Jabalia are a direct consequence of the operational vacuum left by Israel’s previous withdrawal. Additionally, the IDF’s experience in Jabalia underscores the need for intelligence and rapid response capabilities. Intelligence-sharing between the IDF, the Shin Bet intelligence agency, and Military Intelligence has played a crucial role in identifying and neutralizing key Hamas operatives, including those involved in the October 7 massacre. These lessons should inform broader Israeli security policy. The IDF cannot afford to leave areas in Gaza free of security operations for extended periods of time. Only by continuously responding to intelligence regarding developing threats, as the IDF does on a nightly basis in Judea and Samaria, can Israel ensure that Hamas and PIJ are unable to reestablish their networks and pose a renewed threat.

Over 1,000 large Palestinian terror attacks in Jerusalem, Judea &...	Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency reports that over 300 bombing attacks and nearly 600 shooting attacks were foiled in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria over the last year, leading to a 40% reduction in successful terror attacks. By World Israel News Staff Over 1,000 major terror attacks were foiled in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria over the past year, Israel's internal security agency revealed in a report Tuesday morning. The Shin Bet reported that during 2024 the agency thwarted a total of 1,040 'significant terror attacks' in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria, including 689 terrorist shooting attacks, 326 bombing attacks, 13 stabbings, 9 ramming attacks, two suicide bombings, and one kidnapping plot. As a result of the increased counter-terror efforts this past year, the report claimed, the number of terror attacks actually carried out in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria fell by 40% in 2024 as compared to 2023. Over 1,350 suspects were detained in the Gaza Strip, the Shin Bet reported, including senior terrorist operatives and terrorists suspected of possessing information on Israeli hostages in Gaza. Of the suspects detained by the Shin Bet, over 650 revealed 'actionable' information during interrogation which aided ground operations and airstrikes in Gaza. In Lebanon, 25 senior Palestinian terrorists, including members of Hamas, were eliminated in 2024, the Shin Bet said. Inside Israel, 20 Arab-Israeli terrorist cells were uncovered during 2024, including five which had planned large-scale bombing attacks. Separately, the Shin Bet reported that 13 individual spies or spy rings linked to Iran were uncovered in Israel in 2024, fueling a 400% increase in espionage arrests in 2024 as compared to the previous year and resulting in 27 indictments for major offenses. Shin Bet operatives conducted numerous special missions, including three high-risk hostage rescue operations in collaboration with the IDF and the Yamam (Israel’s National Counter-Terrorism Unit). One such operation secured the release of Ori Megidish from Gaza, while others focused on recovering the bodies of hostages for burial in Israel. The Shin Bet's cyber operations division, working in conjunction with the IDF and the National Cyber Directorate, claimed to have foiled some 700 attempted cyber attacks on Israel's infrastructure.

A Strands shanda? NYT game misspells Hanukkah in Festival of Ligh...	You mean to tell me there’s not a single Jew who works at @NYTGames they could have consulted when constructing today’s #Strands?' tweeted Oren Hayon, a rabbi in Houston. By Philissa Cramer, JTA Jewish devotees of the New York Times’ game Strands came in for a shock on Sunday, when the day’s puzzle offered up a Hanukkah theme — and then seemed to botch it. Strands is a word-search game where participants identify six hidden words or phrases in a matrix of letters, including a 'spangram' that stretches from one side to the other. The theme of Sunday’s puzzle was 'Festival of Lights Delights,' signaling that all of the hidden words would likely have to do with Hanukkah. But while 'latkes' and 'applesauce' were solutions, there were no sufganiyot or gelt to be found. Instead, the correct answers included 'kugel,' 'challah' and 'brisket' — all traditional Jewish foods, but not ones prominently associated with Hanukkah. What’s more, the puzzle’s spangram initially featured a spelling of Hanukkah that is not widely used: The answer that crossed the board was 'Hannukah foods.' The puzzle was updated midday to reflect the more normative spelling. The accumulated foibles had Strands aficionados kvetching. 'You mean to tell me there’s not a single Jew who works at @NYTGames they could have consulted when constructing today’s #Strands?' tweeted Oren Hayon, a rabbi in Houston. 'Challah is NOT a Hanukkah food. Brisket and kugel are Jewish cuisine, but not at all specific to Hanukkah. This is like putting ‘egg nog’ in a puzzle about Easter,' tweeted a Philadelphia user named Jeremy Rothman. 'It’s just insulting. Why is this okay?' Griping about Hanukkah representation in the public sphere can be a pastime for some American Jews, who find themselves torn between lamenting that commercialization and assimilation have turned Hanukkah into as big a business as Christmas and craving the sense of inclusion that comes from seeing shelves of menorah tchotchkes at their local Target. But seeing a New York Times product seemingly so out of touch with Jewish culture ignited particular consternation, as the newspaper is seen by both many Jews and their adversaries as a Jewish paper, in ownership and outlook. 'I’ve seen a staggering number of Hanukkah product errors this season from big brands to small brands alike,' said Rabbi Yael Buechler, a self-appointed watchdog of 'Hanukkah fails' who also produces her own Jewish products. 'But I thought The New York Times would answer to a higher authority — or at least an editor.' Buechler’s 8-year-old son is an avid Strands player and took over her social media on Sunday to lament the clumsy execution. 'Come on! Just ask a Jew,' he said, eliciting sympathetic comments. 'Well said, I had a similar reaction!!' wrote Shana Cohen, a knitwear blogger from Denver. 'Just finished it and thought, really?????' responded Erica Feldman. 'Whoever created today’s puzzle is clearly also in charge of making most supermarket and drugstore Hanukkah displays. Badly!' Just how off-base the correct answers were was a matter of some debate. After all, the internet is rife with recipes for Hanukkah briskets — including one from a 2002 essay by Joan Nathan, the doyenne of Jewish cooking, in the New York Times. A meat meal wouldn’t fly for Jews who keep kosher and prefer sour cream on their potato pancakes — but that condiment didn’t exist in the puzzle’s world. ('Bold of Strands to weigh in on the sour cream-applesauce debate,' Abra Lyons-Warren, a nonprofit executive in Washington, D.C., posted on Facebook.) Challah, too, has something of a place at the Hanukkah table. According to Jewish law, the holiday doesn’t require a festive meal, which follows a formula that includes challah. But Hanukkah, one of the most widely and publicly celebrated Jewish holidays, certainly feels festive — so a challah could easily fit the mood. Indeed, a quick Google search for 'Hanukkah challah' reveals many examples — as well as social media posts that showcase challah-themed Hanukkah gear, including one posted by Buechler last week whose shade was so subtle that even some of her own followers said in their comments that they could not detect it. Kugel might be more of a stretch — except that evidence exists to show that early latkes were likely fried cheese pancakes, and there remains a tradition of eating dairy on Hanukkah. (The puzzle does not identify whether the kugel is question is lokshen, potato or Yerushalmi.) The kosher cookbook author and Jewish food influencer Chanie Apfelbaum this year revealed a new concoction: sweet noodle kugel latkes with raisin jam. On Sunday night, she posted that she was making them for the second time this year. Even the original spelling of Hanukkah wasn’t definitively wrong: All English spellings of the holiday are transliterations of Hebrew, allowing for a range of defensible options. Melissa Barsky used another possibility when summarizing the mixed feelings of many Strands players in a comment on Buechler’s Instagram post. 'Just played Strands, they definitely failed at the clues today,' Barsky wrote. 'Glad they had a Chanukah themed game but wish they chose better words.' Jews were far from the only Strands players befuddled by Sunday’s puzzle. Several non-Jews posted in online chats devoted to the game that they had discovered they knew far less about the Jewish holiday than they should. And a handful posted that they had been looking for clues related to a totally different festival of lights, one celebrated by 1.2 billion Hindus around the world. Wrote a user on the social media platform Bluesky, 'Good luck to anyone in the UK, who would probably assume the festival was Diwali. And know absolutely nothing about the actual festival in question.' The post A Strands shanda?

Republican Jewish Coalition endorses Mike Johnson to retain Speak...	Johnson has received immense criticism from the far-right wing of the Republican Party after he helped push through a spending bill that failed to raise the federal debt limit. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) has endorsed Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) to retain his title as speaker of the House of Representatives, citing his strident advocacy for Israel and commitment to combating antisemitism. '[Rep. Mike Johnson] has shown courageous leadership and moral clarity in taking bold action to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the American Jewish community against unprecedented levels of antisemitism, and resolutely defended the State of Israel as it continues to fight an existential war against Iran and its terrorist proxies,' RJC wrote on X/Twitter. 'Speaker Johnson has more than earned our full-throated and enthusiastic support to lead the Republican Majority in the 119th Congress,' RJC added. The RJC’s endorsement comes as Johnson has launched a bid to keep his position as speaker of the House of Representatives. Johnson has received immense criticism from the far-right wing of the Republican party after he helped push through a spending bill that failed to raise the federal debt limit. Over the holiday season, Johnson has faced a rebellion from lawmakers within his party and has had to work alongside Democrats to keep the federal government running, calling into question the extent of his support among fellow Republicans. Over the course of his term as speaker, Johnson has established himself as a stalwart ally of Israel. Last May, the speaker delivered a keynote speech at the US Embassy of Israel, in which he vowed that America will stand with the Jewish state 'in their time of greatest need.' Johnson spearheaded an invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the US Congress, calling out Democrats for expressing half-hearted support to the Jewish state. He subsequently blasted Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping Netanyahu’s address, suggesting that Harris sought to mollify pro-Palestine activists during her failed presidential campaign. Johnson also placed the 'Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act'—legislation which would strip tax-exempt status from charities that lend support to terrorism—on the floor of the House of Representatives. The legislation narrowly passed in the House of Representatives in November.

Over 1,000 terror attacks, 700 cyberattacks foiled by Israel in 2...	In the Gaza Strip, Shin Bet operations led to the detention of over 1,350 individuals during raids. By Pesach Benson, TPS More than 1,000 terror attacks inside Israel were thwarted in 2024, the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) disclosed in its annual report released on Tuesday. The year also saw a surge in cyberattacks, as well as hostage rescue missions in Gaza, and special operations in Jenin and Lebanon. Notable operations included the rescue of hostages and the retrieval of abductees’ bodies for proper burial. Israeli operations have rescued eight hostages alive and recovered 28 bodies from Gaza. Since Hamas’s October 7 attack, cyberattacks on Israel increased five times, the Shin Bet said. Collaborating with the military and the National Cyber Directorate, the Shin Bet thwarted 700 attacks. Of those 66% attempted to gather information or spy on Israelis, 32% sought to damage cyber networks, and the remaining 2% were described as psy-ops, such as phishing attempts. The agency thwarted 1,040 terror attacks, primarily in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria. The figure included 689 shooting attacks, 326 attacks involving explosive devices, 13 stabbings, nine car-rammings, two suicide bombings and one kidnapping. Despite the rise in thwarted attacks, overall incidents in the region decreased by 40%, which the Shin Bet attributed to enhanced intelligence and operational coordination with the army and other security agencies. In the Gaza Strip, Shin Bet operations led to the detention of over 1,350 individuals during raids. This figure included 40 senior operatives and commanders, 165 close associates of senior leaders, and around 100 other individuals suspected of having information concerning the hostages. Interrogations of 650 detainees yielded what the Shin Bet said was actionable intelligence enabling strikes on numerous terror targets. The data contributed to the rescue of hostages and informed ground maneuvers. In Lebanon, the Shin Bet eliminated senior operatives from various Palestinian terror organizations, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Within Israel, the Shin Bet broke up 13 espionage plots, arresting 37 Israelis suspected of spying for Iran, of whom 27 were indicted. The agency also exposed 20 terror cells among Israeli-Arabs.

Hamas reasserting control over southern Gaza, Western diplomats w...	The IDF largely does not enter the areas where most of the Palestinian population now resides. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Western diplomats have warned Israel that Hamas is reinstating civil control over most of the Gazan population, which is concentrated in areas of the Strip that the IDF has not entered for months, Ynet reported Monday. Deir al-Balah and Nuseirat in central Gaza, and the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone near Khan Yunis, which is further south, are the main areas where some 1.9 million Palestinians currently live, they said. The IDF has conducted airstrikes several times to eliminate terrorists in these locations in recent weeks but has refrained from entering on the ground, in contrast to its current operations in northern Gaza. Hamas is reportedly using brutal methods to recover its ruling role, the sources said. This includes, for example, its operatives beating, and even killing, members of criminal factions that try to hijack aid convoys, and taking it for themselves instead. In one case, said the report, the Hamas fighters attacked the robbers right in front of IDF soldiers, who stood by and did nothing. Hamas’ success has surprised many, the diplomats said. One reason for it may be that, at least according to U.S. intelligence, Hamas has succeeded in recruiting 10,000 new terrorists to its ranks, said the report. This would bolster both its abilities to reassert civilian control and threaten Israel militarily. The IDF rejected the American analysis, saying that while the Iranian proxy still retains some military capabilities, as recent rockets fired on Israel and attacks on IDF troops in the Strip can attest, Hamas is 'finished' as far as command and control of its forces. One of Israel’s official war aims, announced very soon after the Hamas-led invasion and massacre last October 7 sparked the ongoing conflict, was to strip Hamas of its power in Gaza. Senior IDF officials warned Monday yet again that the political echelon’s inability to strategize who else will control the coastal enclave after the war is over and prepare the execution of its plan will lead to Hamas filling the vacuum. 'In the absence of an alternative, Hamas will inevitably return to power,' they said, even if Israel defeated it militarily, because 'when families try to resist, Hamas suppresses them ruthlessly. But the larger issue is the absence of leadership or energy for rebellion.' 'Decisions must be made now, before any hostage deals or cease-fire agreements,' they urged, with one official noting that 'The lesson from October 7 is not just to stop turning a blind eye but to stop deferring critical decisions. 'Difficult steps must be taken now. Hoping for quiet hasn’t worked—it’s time to face reality and act decisively,' the official said. Prime Minister Netanyahu and his coalition have ruled out giving any leading role in Gaza to the Palestinian Authority (PA), deeming the officially secular nationalists just as anti-Israel as Hamas, with its financial backing and active encouragement of terrorism. Although this has been the preferred solution of the outgoing Biden administration, given vague 'reforms' the PA is supposed to put in place, the Authority is also deeply disliked by most Palestinians, especially those under its direct control in Judea and Samaria, who consider its officials thoroughly corrupt and inept. The idea favored by the more right-wing factions in Jerusalem is for the IDF to assert military control over the Strip for at least for the foreseeable future, because that is the only way to ensure Israel’s security.

Court orders Israel to explain transfers of millions of shekels t...	In 2020, according to the report, Israel transferred 700 million shekels ($190 million) of import taxes to the P.A., and in 2021, the figure surpassed 1.5 billion shekels ($410 million). By Natan Galula, JNS Israel’s Supreme Court, sitting as the High Court of Justice, issued a conditional order against the State of Israel on Monday for a potential unlawful transfer of billions in shekels of import taxes to the Palestinian Authority. It is now up to state authorities to explain why the transfer of the funds is continuing routinely despite a discrepancy between declared goods imported into Israel and the goods subsequently entering the Palestinian territories. Justices Noam Solberg, David Mintz and Yosef Elron ordered Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, the Israel Tax Authority and the State Attorney’s Office to provide answers in the next court discussion, Yakov Sela, spokesperson for one of the organizations that petitioned the High Court on the issue, told JNS on Monday. 'We conducted a comparative analysis. We checked how many of the goods that are supposed to enter the Palestinian territories arrive at Israeli seaports in Ashdod and Haifa, versus how many goods actually enter the Palestinian territories,' said Sela, the spokesman for Lavi, an NGO that deals in proper administration and civil rights. 'What we have found is that 60% of the goods never enter the Palestinian Authority,' he continued. 'So Israel pays the P.A. its declared [import] taxes, but in reality the merchandize is sold in Israel [without import taxes]. We pay the P.A. 60% taxes that it doesn’t deserve,' Sela said. Israeli and Palestinian importers arrive at Israel’s ports to pick up the goods, they pay import taxes to Israeli authorities, who then transfer the full sum to the P.A. despite only 40% of the goods entering the Palestinian territories. Sela went on to say that he does not know where exactly the merchandise is sold and why this is allowed to happen. The Kohelet Policy Forum and Lavi between them filed three petitions to Israeli courts, demanding that a criminal investigation be opened against those involved, the transferring of funds be halted, and the enforcement of the regulations that exist under the Finance Ministry. 30 years Following the report, the ministry released a statement on Monday. 'For 30 years, since the Oslo Accords, there was indeed a loophole that allowed the Palestinian Authority to receive about 100 million shekels [about $27.3 million] a year in tax money that should go to the State of Israel. Since Knesset member Avihai Boaron and Kohelet and Lavi raised the issue, the Ministries of Finance and Defense worked to close the loophole, and it was indeed closed,' the Finance Ministry stated. 'The order is ready following public feedback, and in the coming week, after the approval of the Ministry of Justice, the Minister of Finance will sign the order that will require the closing of a circuit in crossings for designated goods and will allow the imposition of guarantees and sanctions on traders who do not go through the organized crossing and who deceive the tax authorities and thus the issue will come to a close,' the statement read. According to the Protocol on Economic Relations (aka the Paris Protocol) agreements struck in 1994 between Israel and the PLO, containers of goods destined for the Palestinian Authority will be unloaded from ships in Israeli ports, and transported by trucks to the Palestinians. It was agreed that Israel will collect the import taxes and transfer them to the Palestinian Authority, with the proportion of funds to be transferred from Israel determined by the declared goods of Palestinian importers. Since 2019, most declared goods intended for the Palestinian Authority never reach their destination, Ynet reported. In 2020, according to the report, Israel transferred 700 million shekels ($190 million) of import taxes to the P.A., and in 2021, the figure surpassed 1.5 billion shekels ($410 million). Justice Elron was quoted by Ynet as saying, 'What advantage lies in making the tax calculations according to [importers’] declarations? Do the goods end up staying in Israel? What’s going on here?'

Palestinian Authority backs Israel’s claims Hamas using Gaza hosp...	Israel has long accused Hamas of using Gaza hospitals as command and control centers. Now the Palestinian Authority's paramilitary security force is backing up Israel's claims. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Palestinian Authority has confirmed accusations by Israel's military that the Hamas terror organization is using hospitals in the Gaza Strip as de facto command and control centers. Throughout the current war against Hamas, which began on October 7th, 2023, Israel's military has maintained that the Islamist terror group has taken control of medical centers in the coastal enclave, using them to shelter terror operatives and as local command facilities. Last week, the Palestinian National Security Forces, the PA's paramilitary police force, revealed evidence that Hamas used the Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis as an interrogation center for Hamas military intelligence. In a Facebook post, PNSF spokesman Adnan Al-Damiri published an photograph of a summons, issued by Hamas, to a Gazan man ordered to report for interrogation at Nasser Hospital. According to a translation provided by the Palestinian Media Watch, the order reads: State of Palestine, Ministry of Interior and National Security Internal Security Force Summons To Citizen: Shadi Subhi Al-Suweiti, aka: Abu Subhi. Address: Khan Yunis/Al-Mawasi. Under the law of the State of Palestine and in accordance with our vested authority, you are to report to: Premises: Nasser Medical Center Office: Public Relations On: Wednesday Date: 16 October 2024 At: 11:30 AM Attendance is mandatory and legally binding. Bring your ID card or passport. Facebook post by Adnan Al-Damiri. (PMW) Al-Damiri blasted Hamas for its use of the hospital to conduct 'interrogations and extortions.' 'Read the summons, its date, the sender and the recipient,' Al-Damiri wrote. 'How, when, and where Hamas' militias summon a citizen in Gaza in the name of the State of Palestine. They order him to come to a security interrogation office at Nasser Hospital (note where). The summonses, interrogations, and extortions continue in whatever remains of the hospitals.'

Netanyahu to continue Gaza war after ceasefire – report	Israeli prime minister quoted as saying that Israel will 'return to fighting' immediately after Gaza ceasefire, and is reportedly pushing for public declaration vowing war will not end even if hostage deal reached. By World Israel News Staff Israel will not agree to permanently end the current war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip as part of a hostage deal with the terror group, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quoted as saying recently, insisting that the war will resume after a temporary ceasefire. According to a report by Israel's Channel 12, last week, Netanyahu said at a gathering, which included officials involved in Israel's efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas, that Israel will not end its war on the Islamist terror group as part of a deal. Netanyahu reportedly added that Israel should openly declare that it will resume the war at the conclusion of a possible ceasefire. 'If there is a deal — and I hope there will be,' Netanyahu was quoted as saying, 'Israel will return to fighting afterward.' 'There is no point in pretending otherwise because returning to fighting is needed in order to complete the goals of the war. Saying this does not thwart a deal, it encourages a deal.' A senior Israeli official appeared to confirm the claim Monday, telling Yedioth Aharanoth that Netanyahu said last week that 'Even if Israel agrees to a deal, it will resume fighting afterward in order to complete the goals of the war.' According to the Channel 12 report, Israel's negotiating team expressed concern over Netanyahu's call for Israel to go on record pledging to resume the war after any ceasefire, fearing it could hamper efforts to reach an agreement. Hamas has thus far demanded that a hostage deal include a permanent cessation the war and the withdrawal of IDF forces from the Gaza Strip.

Israel imposes new bureaucratic red-tape on incoming tourists	Application for entry permit must be sent in days in advance, a permit doesn’t guarantee entry, and costs about $7 apiece. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Starting Wednesday, January 1, all visitors to Israel who have had smooth sailing entering the country because they come from visa-exempt countries will now have to apply for a different authorization to cross the border. The Population and Immigration Authority (PIBA) is instituting a mandatory procedure whereby travelers who do not hold Israeli citizenship or permanent residency IDs must go online to receive an electronic travel authorization permit (ETA-IL). The short form requests personal data such as one’s name, date of birth and nationality, travel information such as the reason for coming and dates of arrival and departure, passport information including a photo, and a valid email address. All members of a family must fill out their own form, each one of which costs NIS25, or about $7. According to PIBA, applications should be submitted at least three days before the planned arrival, because it can take up to that long to receive the permit by email. Those who are more hesitant regarding the speed of reply may want to apply earlier. The PIBA website advises that the form will time out in 30 minutes, meaning that it is best to have all the required information and digital picture at hand before starting. Once approved, the tourists can come for up to 90 days as many times as they wish over a two-year period, or until their current passports expire, whichever comes first. If they want to stay for a longer period, they will have to request an 'extension of stay' from PIBA. In addition, if they change their 'name, gender, or country of citizenship,' the Authority states, a new application will have to be submitted. The Authority also makes clear that receiving a travel permit does not automatically mean that visitors can enter Israel; it just allows them to present themselves at one of the country’s borders. Although this is considered a security procedure, and many other Western countries have instituted a similar requirement, including the U.S., Europe and Australia, critics say that this is not the time to make travel to Israel more onerous. Yossi Fatael, Israel Inbound Tour Operators Association director-general, told The Times of Israel Tuesday, 'We don’t think it’s wise to introduce any bureaucratic burden in our war situation when coming to Israel is not something that people are considering easily.' 'Israel needs the incoming tourism not only from the economic point of view, but also these people will be the ones that will speak differently about us when they return home to improve our reputation,' he added. Tourism is down 80%, with most major airlines not even flying into Israel due to the possibility of incoming missiles hitting their planes, although the country’s defense array has successfully shot down almost every aerial threat to the center of the country, whether launched from the Gaza Strip (Hamas), Lebanon (Hezbollah) or Yemen (Houthis). As a precautionary measure, Ben Gurion Airport has been shut down several times over the past year for periods ranging from minutes to several hours. On Monday night, the Houthis fired a ballistic missile at Israel and falsely claimed to have hit the airport, which had halted operations for less than half an hour during the attack. The IDF said it shot down the missile before it crossed into Israeli airspace.

Hamas pushing to release bodies of dead captives in lieu of live ...	Palestinian official tells Israeli national broadcaster that Hamas is insisting that one-third of the Israeli captives to be released in hostage deal be from the list of dead captives, rejecting Israel's efforts to secure release of 34 living hostages. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terrorist organization is refusing to free 34 living Israeli captives during the first phase of a ceasefire with Israel, a Palestinian source told Israel's national broadcaster, claiming that the Gaza group is insisting instead that the remains of dead hostages make up roughly one-third of the number of captives to be released. On Monday night, Israel's Kan cited an unnamed Palestinian official who said that current hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar, which have discussed a possible three-phase ceasefire, remain deadlocked on the number of living hostages to be freed in the first phase of the truce. Currently, the two sides have tentatively agreed that 34 captives will be returned during the first phase of the ceasefire, in exchange for the release of hundreds of jailed Palestinian Arab terrorists. However, while Israel has insisted that all 34 captives to be released in the first phase be from the list of living hostages, Hamas has thus far refused. Of the roughly 100 captives still held in the Gaza Strip, Israel estimates that approximately 50 are still alive. While Israel has confirmed the deaths of 34 hostages, military intelligence suggests that over a dozen more are also likely dead. Hamas, according to the report, is willing to release only 22 living hostages, with the remains of 12 dead captives to be transferred to Israel in addition. Israel's negotiating team reportedly rejected the Hamas proposal, doubling down on Jerusalem's position that all 34 hostages released in the first phase be living captives. The two sides also remain divided on the extent of an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip during the proposed truce, with Israel insisting that the IDF retain control over key strategic areas in the Strip.

Israel promises to destroy Houthis like Hamas, Hezbollah	It’s time the world wakes up,' says Israel's ambassador to the UN. 'Iran’s fingerprints are on every missile, every drone.' By World Israel News Staff Israel pledged that the Houthis will meet the same 'miserable' fate as the Hezbollah and Hamas terror groups during an emergency session at the United Nations. The meeting, focused on the Houthis' ongoing attacks on Israel and international shipping, was requested by Israel last week. 'To the Houthis, perhaps you have not been paying attention to what has happened to the Middle East over the past year. Well, allow me to remind you what has happened to Hamas, to Hezbollah, to Assad, to all those who have attempted to destroy us. Let this be your final warning. This is not a threat. It is a promise. You will share the same miserable fate,' Ambassador Danny Danon said at the UN Security Council. Danon noted that a Houthi attack had destroyed an elementary school in his hometown of Ramat Gan. He stressed that Iran, as the Houthis' patron, bears responsibility for the repeated attacks against Israel. 'It’s time the world wakes up,' Danon said. 'Iran’s fingerprints are on every missile, every drone.' In a media statement before the hearing, Danon told reporters that 'Israel will defend its people. If 2,000 kilometers is not enough to separate our children from the terror, let me assure you, it will not be enough to protect their terror from our strengths.' Last week, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar called on the international community to officially designate the Houthis as a terror group. He noted that beyond their attacks on shipping and the Jewish State, the 'Houthis have also taken hostages, including UN workers.' He added that 'it’s time for the international community to take action to counter the Houthis’ aggression.' According to the Houthis, they have launched thirteen explosive drones and ballistic missiles at Israel in the last 10 days. Most of those projectiles were intercepted by Israel's air defenses.

Houthi ballistic missile intercepted, sirens wail in central Isra...	Houthi official threatens in Hebrew tweet that 'more surprises are on the way.' By World Israel News Staff A Houthi-launched ballistic missile triggered sirens throughout central Israel late Monday evening, sending millions of Israelis into bomb shelters for the fifth time in a week. The launch followed two days of quiet, after the Houthis ramped up their launches of explosive drones and missiles in mid-Decemeber. Air raid alarms sounded in the Tel Aviv area, Jerusalem suburbs, and southern Israel. Flight departures and arrivals at Ben Gurion Airport were suspended for approximately 30 minutes following the sirens. The missile was intercepted by Israel's air defenses, which were recently bolstered by the American THAAD interception system. An 18-year-old woman in Yavne was struck by a vehicle as she sought shelter during the sirens. She was transported to a local hospital in good condition. A number of people were lightly injured while running to shelters, the Magen David Adom emergency response organization said in a media statement. 'The battering of [Israel] continues and the support to Gaza continues,' Mohamed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the Houthis’ supreme revolutionary committee, wrote in an X post shortly after the launch. In a Hebrew-language tweet published some two hours after the attack, Houthi official Hazam al-Assad threatened that 'more surprises are on the way.' IDF sappers responded to reports of fallen shrapnel and other debris from the interception in Yavne, Beit Shemesh, and Harish. In Beit Shemesh, a large crowd gathered at the scene where a large metal fragment impacted a road. 'I was home in my apartment, running to the shelter as soon as I heard the siren with my wife, my mother-in-law and my baby,' Aaron Heideman, who is visiting from the U.S., told the Times of Israel. 'It’s crazy to see with my own eyes that this is real, this is serious. I always have faith in God so I’m not scared but it is surreal,' he added.

Trump will ‘destroy’ Iran, weaken Hamas – PA official	Hamas will be dealt severe blow by Trump's tough stance on Iran, says senior Palestinian Authority official. By World Israel News Staff A senior official from the Palestinian Authority's ruling Fatah party is predicting that incoming president Donald Trump will 'destroy' Iran's influence in the Middle East, which will prove to be a significant blow for Hamas. Although Hamas has been severely crippled by some 14 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip, the terror group's influence is growing in PA-controlled enclaves in Judea and Samaria. The PA has launched a number of counter-terror operations aimed at driving Hamas and other terror groups out of its territory. Many PA officials have claimed that Hamas is a movement separate from mainstream Palestinian bodies, citing Iranian influence on the terror group. 'We are confronting Hamas’ ideology. Our problem is with Hamas’ link to regimes outside Palestine,' Mohammad Hamdan, the Secretary General of Fatah, told the New York Post. 'We see that Trump and the ruling government in Israel are planning to destroy Iran, so Hamas [followers] will have no other choice than to become Palestinian,' he added, insinuating that the terror group could be absorbed by the PA. In the Post interview, Hamdan stressed that the PA views Hamas as an illegal entity. 'Hamas rejects international legitimacy, meaning UN resolutions,' Hamdan said. 'The world cannot accept a situation where a party does not accept international resolutions.' The PA's condemnation of Hamas may be rooted more in the political threat posed by the terror group, rather than opposition to their agenda. Notably, Hamas is extremely popular among residents of PA-controlled areas. Polls have consistently found that Hamas would easily beat PA incumbents should elections be held. President-elect Trump has pledged to take a hard line against Hamas, threatening that there will be 'hell to pay' if the terror group does not release the hostages it has been holding for more than a year.

Israel slams German ambassador for spreading Hamas propaganda	Seibert wrote: 'If reports about 3 babies freezing to death in Gaza don't move us then we don't understand the birth in a manger in Bethlehem or the light of Hanukkah.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's Foreign Ministry spokesman strongly criticized Steffen Seibert, Germany's ambassador to Israel, for posting Hamas allegations that Israel is responsible for Gazan babies allegedly freezing to death, i24 reports. Steffen Seibert posted on X: 'If reports about 3 babies freezing to death in Gaza don't move us then we don't understand the birth in a manger in Bethlehem or the light of Hanukkah. They should move us to demand an end of the war and Hamas terror, winter supplies for the Gazans and a full hostage release.' Israel's Foreign Minister spokesman, Oren Marmorstein, responded to Seibert's post: 'An ambassador is expected to rely on verified facts, not assumptions or imaginations.' 'It has already been proven so many times that doctors in Gaza publish Hamas propaganda rather than facts. Regardless, Israel is eager to end the war as soon as Hamas lays down its weapons and all our hostages are returned home. Unfortunately, this is not happening due to Hamas's decision to continue its Jihadist war it launched on Oct 7,' Marmorstein added. Seibert, appearing to try to walk back his previous post, only reinforced his previous point, which involved believing Hamas propaganda. Seibert wrote, 'About my last post: I don't know for sure what happened (nor do I claim that), but I can imagine that a weak newborn could die from hypothermia there (9-10 degrees at night in a tent, the ground cold, wind outside). Gaza doctors have said as much and I don't think they all lie.' Seibert has been taken to task in the past for anti-Israel comments and activities. Shortly after Oct 7, he attended an 'Alternative Day of Remembrance,' which included Palestinian terrorists among 'victims.' His attendance at the event prompted Germany's embassy in Tel Aviv to write, 'Ambassador Seibert did not participate in any 'memorial event for Hamas terrorists' in the past and will, of course, not do so in the future.' In addition, Seibert has worked with NGOs, including Ir Amim, which regularly demonizes Israel. Seibert's comments and actions have led Israelis and Jews in the Diaspora to request that he be recalled from his post as ambassador. 'How is it possible that the German Ambassador to Israel, of all people, with all that being the German representative in Israel entails, historically and emotionally, can tweet an unconfirmed rumor like some antisemitic internet troll? Germany should withdraw Steffen Seibert immediately, and if not, the Israeli government should throw him out of Israel,' prominent Beverly Hills Rabbi Pini Dunner wrote on X.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A Channel 12 report reveals that Hamas was monitoring border communities and collecting intel for seven years before the massacre on October 7th, 2023. The terror group used surveillance camera footage of kibbutzim and sensitive documents to collect information before the attacks. In a document from November 2020, Hamas collected IP addresses and serial numbers for all security cameras within the Sha'ar Hanegev Regional Council and Ashkelon beach areas, including Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Another document included a list of security guards in the Kibbutzim, including their personal information and phone numbers. Also discovered was a six-page document detailing attack plans for each community. Documents dating back to 2016 show information about areas that were hit particularly hard on October 7th, including the health clinic and kindergarten in Kibbutz Be'eri and the police stations in Ofakim and Sderot. 'We are seeing exact and detailed intelligence from what is essentially an army — the Hamas military wing in the Gaza Strip — which is gathering information on targets for attack and preparing intelligence files on those targets,' Shalom Ben Hanan, a former senior Shin Bet official, told Channel 12. 'The level of resolution, the precise details, and the extensive deployment of numerous intelligence assets make this so surprising,' he added. Hamas was also tracking local leaders and security officials in southern Israel before the attack, some of whom were killed during the invasion. Since 2014, Hamas leaders trained terrorist troops without providing any information on what kind of mission they were training for, according to Arab sources. The London-based Arabic-language newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Awsat cited sources close to Hamas's military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigade, as saying that the purpose of the training was known only to 70 members of its elite Nukhba unit. However, the precise date of October 7th was kept a secret from everyone but the three terror masterminds behind the massacre–Yahya Sinwar, his brother Mohammed as well as Mohammed Deif and two other Hamas senior officials. The five 'partners in secrecy' decided that Saturday morning was the best time for the attack after reports from surveillance showed 'absolute quiet on the border.'

Israel turns to Indian workers to replace Palestinians	Over the past year, approximately 16,000 have arrived from the South Asian nation, with plans to recruit thousands more. By JNS In the wake of the labor shortage caused by the barring of Palestinian workers for security reasons after the Oct. 7, 2023 attack, Israel has turned to Indian laborers to fill construction jobs. Approximately 16,000 Indian workers have arrived over the past year, with plans to recruit thousands more, according to AFP. While this initiative has eased the labor gap, it falls short of replacing the 80,000 Palestinians from Judea and Samaria who previously worked in the sector, slowing construction and risking a housing shortage. According to Eyal Argov, head of the Macroeconomics and Policy Division in the Bank of Israel’s Research Department, before the attack, the construction industry employed about 80,000 Palestinians and 26,000 foreign workers. Now, about 30,000 foreign workers are employed, significantly fewer than pre-war levels. Argov highlighted that construction activity in late 2024 was approximately 25% below pre-conflict levels. Despite the growing number of Indian workers, Argov cautioned that their numbers remain insufficient to meet demand. While there is no immediate housing shortage, delays in the supply of new housing could occur. With Israel’s population growing at an annual rate of 2%, such delays may lead to shortages in the future.

‘Root of anti-Israel Woke culture’ – Israeli leaders give mixed r...	Israeli president and prime minister eulogize Jimmy Carter and emphasize his role in the Israel-Egypt peace treaty - while member of ruling coalition slams the 39th president for his role in nurturing 'anti-Israel Woke culture.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli leaders responded to the passing of former American President Jimmy Carter with mixed messages Monday, with the Israeli president and premier both emphasizing Carter's role in the historic Camp David Accords and subsequent peace treaty with Egypt, while overlooking his sharp criticism of the settlement movement and the accusations in his later life of Israeli apartheid in Judea and Samaria. In a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office Monday morning, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his condolences to the family of the 39th president, and lauded his role in brokering peace talks between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. 'The government of Israel sends its condolences to the Carter family and the American people upon the passing of President Jimmy Carter.' 'We will always remember President Carter’s role in forging the first Arab-Israeli peace treaty signed by Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, a peace treaty that has held for nearly half a century and offers hope for future generations.' Israel's head of state, President Isaac Herzog, echoed Netanyahu's comments, hailing Carter as a 'brave leader' who forged the first Arab-Israel peace treaty. 'Today the world says goodbye to a brave leader: the 39th President of the United States of America, Jimmy Carter.' 'In recent years I had the pleasure of calling him and thanking him for his historic efforts to bring together two great leaders, Begin and Sadat, and forging a peace between Israel and Egypt that remains an anchor of stability throughout the Middle East and North Africa many decades later. His legacy will be defined by his deep commitment to forging peace between nations.' 'On behalf of the Israeli people, I send my condolences to his family, his loved ones, and to t the American people.' Both Herzog and Netanyahu carefully avoided mention of Carter's sharp disagreements with Israel while in office, including his adamant opposition to the settlement movement and the expansion of Israel's presence in Judea, Samaria, Gaza, and the Golan Heights. In his later years, Carter became a prominent critic of the Jewish state, accusing Israel of 'worse&#8230;apartheid&#8230;than we witnessed even in South Africa.' 'When Israel does occupy this territory deep within the West Bank, and connects the 200-or-so settlements with each other, with a road, and then prohibits the Palestinians from using that road, or in many cases even crossing the road, this perpetrates even worse instances of apartness, or apartheid, than we witnessed even in South Africa,' Carter wrote in his controversial 2006 New York Times bestseller, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid. A member of the ruling Israeli coalition, however, did highlight Carter's anti-Israel rhetoric, and criticized Israeli leaders for eulogizing the late former president. 'There is no mitzvah to emotionally eulogize those who were aligned with Israel's enemies,' tweeted MK Simcha Rothman (Religious Zionist Party). Chairman of the Knesset's powerful Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, Rothman is one of the two primary architects of the government's judicial reform. In his tweet Monday, Rothman claimed that Carter was largely to blame for the rise of anti-Israel sentiment in the American progressive Left. 'The legitimacy that Carter granted to the worst of Israel's enemies and America's enemies, which intensified in his later years, must not be forgotten.' 'The roots of the Woke culture and anti-Israel sentiment grew significantly during Carter's time. The man who met with Hamas leaders and called Israel an apartheid state is not worthy of a eulogy like this from the President of Israel.' Underneath his post, Rothman included a photograph of Carter meeting with then-Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh, during a visit to Gaza City in 2009. 'In 2015, the then-President of Israel, Reuven Rivlin, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, rightly refused to meet Carter. May his memory serve as a turning point in the world's approach to terror and its supporters. May we learn from him what should not be done and how we should not act in the face of global jihad.'

Hamas ‘does not want’ a hostage deal – Netanyahu	Israeli prime minister says Gaza terror group to blame for impasse in hostage deal talks, accusing Hamas of effectively blocking progress towards ceasefire deal. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization is not taking hostage deal and ceasefire talks in Doha, Qatar seriously and 'does not want' to reach an agreement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. Speaking during the weekly government meeting, just hours before he was hospitalized at Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center for the removal of his prostate, Netanyahu said Hamas was to blame for the recent deadlock in hostage deal talks. Hamas 'does not want there to be a deal,' Netanyahu said, according to a report by The Jerusalem Post. Government ministers were updated during the weekly meeting on the status of efforts to reach a hostage deal with Hamas. Following several weeks of optimistic reports regarding the prospects for a deal, particularly after President-elect Donald Trump's November victory, ministers told the Post that now 'the situation is less optimistic.' Last week, Israel's negotiating team left Qatar, returning home for consultations, amid reports that Hamas has reneged on its apparent willingness earlier this month to compromise on key issues. Chief among the contested issues are Hamas' demand that Israel withdraw from the Gaza Strip in the third and final phase of a ceasefire, including from strategic areas Israel has claimed are crucial to ensuring its post-war security, such as the Philadelphi Corridor and the Netzarim Corridor. The two sides are also sharply divided over the release of high-profile terrorists jailed in Israel. While Hamas is expected to secure the release of hundreds of terrorists in exchange for the freeing of Israeli hostages, it has yet to be decided which terrorists will be included in the list. Hamas negotiators have demanded that prominent figures, including the terrorist mastermind Marwan Barghouti, who orchestrated suicide bombing attacks in Israel during the Second Intifada, be among those released - a demand Israel has hitherto vetoed.

Netanyahu in ‘good condition’ after surgery to remove prostate	The Israeli prime minister expected to remain in the hospital for several days as he recovers from the operation. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underwent successful surgery on Sunday night to remove his prostate, according to a statement from his office. 'The prime minister has awakened from the anesthesia, is in good condition and is fully conscious. He has been transferred to the underground, protected recovery unit. He is expected to remain in the hospital for observation in the coming days,' added the statement. Last Wednesday, Netanyahu, 75, underwent an examination at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem’s Ein Kerem, during which a urinary tract infection caused by a benign prostate enlargement was identified. On March 31, Netanyahu underwent successful hernia surgery, also at Hadassah Medical Center. On Dec. 31, 2023, following routine annual checkups by his medical team, Netanyahu received a clean bill of health after undergoing an emergency cardiac procedure earlier in the year.

Former President Jimmy Carter, architect of Camp David Accords an...	The 39th president leaves behind a mixed legacy on Israel, spanning his role in brokering the peace treaty with Egypt, his harsh criticism of Israel's presence in Judea and Samaria, and later accusations of apartheid. By Andrew Bernard, JNS Former President Jimmy Carter died 'peacefully' at his home in Plains, Ga., surrounded by family on Sunday at the age of 100, the Carter Center announced. He leaves behind a legacy as a lifelong humanitarian, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, and a one-term presidency that was mired in domestic challenges and a mixed foreign policy. Carter’s term in office from 1977 to 1981 was defined by what he described in a 1979 speech as a 'crisis of confidence' and what others termed 'malaise': high unemployment, double-digit inflation and slow economic growth. In foreign policy, he presided over some of the most significant developments of the Cold War, and many of his decisions remain controversial. In 1977, Carter signed the Panama Canal Treaty, which handed over control of the U.S. Panama Canal Zone to the Panamanians in 1979 and the canal itself to them in 1999. (On Dec. 21, President-elect Donald Trump accused Panama of violating that treaty, saying that if Panama did not change its behavior he would 'demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full.') In 1978, Carter led the Camp David negotiations that made peace between Israel and Egypt—the first peace treaty establishing relations between the Jewish state and one of its Arab neighbors. The Iranian revolution and the subsequent oil crisis and Soviet invasion of Afghanistan—all in 1979—posed a sufficient threat to U.S. energy security to prompt Carter to announce that Washington would respond militarily to threats to its interests in the Persian Gulf under the eponymous 'Carter Doctrine.' (That doctrine remains a basis for U.S. policy in the region.) Carter formally severed relations with Iran in 1980, five months after the start of the Iran hostage crisis, in which student revolutionaries seized the U.S. embassy compound and took 66 American hostages, holding them for 444 days until the day Carter left office on Jan. 20, 1981. Amid the domestic and foreign policy crises, former California Gov. Ronald Reagan defeated Carter in a landslide in 1980, winning 44 states and carrying the popular vote by 10 points. In his nearly 44 years post-presidency, he devoted himself to humanitarian projects through the Carter Center and Habitat for Humanity’s Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project. The Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee awarded Carter the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 'for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.' Carter’s post-presidential forays into international politics proved more controversial. In 2006, he published Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, which critics denounced as being biased against Israel and insufficiently condemnatory of terrorist groups. 'The book contains numerous distortions of history and interpretation and apparently, outright fabrications as well,' the Central Conference of American Rabbis, a Reform Judaism rabbinical organization, wrote in 2007. 'Its use of the term ‘apartheid’ to describe conditions in the West Bank serves only to demonize and delegitimize Israel in the eyes of the world.' Carter defended the book, saying that the title was not intended to accuse Israel of being an 'apartheid' state. 'I’ve never alleged that the framework of apartheid existed within Israel at all and that what does exist in the West Bank is based on trying to take Palestinian land and not on racism,' he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in 2007. U.S. President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden stated that 'America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian.' 'With his compassion and moral clarity, he worked to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless and always advocate for the least among us,' the president and first lady stated. 'He saved, lifted and changed the lives of people all across the globe.' Biden added that he was ordering that an official state funeral be held in Washington for the former president. Trump stated that 'those of us who have been fortunate to have served as president understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the greatest nation in history.' 'The challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude,' Trump stated. 'Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers.' The American Jewish Committee recognized Carter’s mixed legacy in and out of office for many American Jews and supporters of Israel, including 'strained' relations with American Jews after he published Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid. 'While AJC had some profound disagreements with President Carter about the Middle East, especially in the decades after he left the White House, his key role in creating the historic 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty will always be remembered with appreciation,' the AJC stated. 'The first peace treaty between Israel and an Arab country came about in large measure due to Carter’s personal intervention in the process, engaging Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for nearly two weeks at Camp David in 1978.' 'Carter’s support for the freedom of Jews in the Soviet Union, signing of legislation in 1977 banning American corporations and individuals from complying with the Arab boycott of Israel and establishing in 1978 the President’s Commission on the Holocaust, which led to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1993, have had decisive, positive long-term impact,' the AJC stated. 'Carter’s volunteer work since 1984 for Habitat for Humanity,' it added, 'exemplified his lifelong concern for the dignity and well-being of the less fortunate.' B’nai B’rith International stated, 'We note the passing of former President Jimmy Carter, broker of the Camp David accords and later a harsh critic of Israel. Peace between Israel and Egypt presaged a broader Middle East peace that Israelis have formed with other Arab countries more recently.' ‘Deep, abiding faith’ James Earl Carter Jr. was born in Plains, Ga., in 1924 to James Earl Carter Sr., a local businessman and politician, and Bessie Lillian Carter, a nurse. Carter graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1947 and served as a nuclear submarine officer until retiring from active duty in 1953 when he returned home to run the family peanut farm and packaging business. He married Rosalynn Smith in 1946 and the two celebrated their 77th anniversary in 2023, before Rosalynn’s death that year, aged 96. The future president entered local politics in the early 1960s as a quiet, pro-civil rights southern Democrat at a time when the party dominated the state on a pro-segregation platform and served two terms in the state’s senate from 1963 to 1967. After a failed gubernatorial bid in 1966 against the staunch segregationist Lester Maddox, Carter won the governor’s mansion in 1970 and declared in his inaugural address that 'the time for racial discrimination is over.' Four months after Richard Nixon resigned from the presidency amid the Watergate scandal, Carter announced his intention to run for president in December 1974. Though not widely known nationally at the time, Carter won a crowded Democratic primary and narrowly defeated President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. In his 1977 inaugural address, Carter quoted from the prophet Micah, 'What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?' according to a Carter Center tribute site. 'For many who knew and worked with him, those words aptly summarize his life of faith and service.' Carter 'was a deeply religious man, a Baptist lay leader, teaching Sunday school most of his adult life while at the same time adamantly adhering to the separation of church and state,' according to the center. 'For three decades, he and Mrs. Carter spent one week a year helping build housing for the poor through Habitat for Humanity.' (Biden stated that Carter 'was guided by a deep and abiding faith—in God, in America and in humanity.') 'He was the author of 32 books' and 'a skilled woodworker, accomplished painter and an active outdoorsman, enjoying fishing, hunting and birding throughout his life,' the center added. Carter entered hospice care in 2023 following a cancer diagnosis. The former president is survived by four children, 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren and was preceded in death by his wife, Rosalynn, and one grandchild. Funeral observances for the former president will be held in Atlanta and Washington. The final arrangements, including public observances, are still pending.

Trove of ancient coins owned by Hasmonean king discovered during ...	Israeli researchers working during Hanukkah festival unearthed a rare hoard of 160 coins which belonged to a Hasmonean king. By World Israel News Staff A hoard of coins which once belonged to a Jewish king from the Hasmonean dynasty were discovered in Israel's Jordan Valley on the second day of Hanukkah last week. Researchers at University of Haifa’s Zinman Institute of Archaeology announced Monday that they had uncovered a rare hoard of coins that belonged to King Alexander Jannaeus, the second king of the Hasmonean dynasty, during a dig that took place over the Hanukkah season. The excavation was led by Dr. Shay Bar, Dr. Yoav Farhi and Dr. Mechael Osband who made their exceptional discovery on Friday morning. Alexander Jannaeus (whose Hebrew name was Jonathan) ruled over the kingdom of Judea from 103 to 76 BCE. A descendent of Jewish royalty, King Jannaeus was the son of John Hyrcanus and grandson of Simon the Hasmonean (the brother of Judah Maccabee) and great grandson of Mattathias who led the revolt against the armies of Antiochus. That famous revolt, which broke out in 167 BCE, led to, among other things, the cleansing of the Temple which we now celebrate every year during the holiday of Hanukkah. 'We believe that the coins were discovered at a way station, which we didn’t know about until this excavation,' said Dr. Bar. 'The site included a purification mikveh, a pool and other buildings and was located along the Tirzah River Valley on the main road that leads to the Sartaba fortress which was built by King Jannaeus.' Dr. Farhi, who is a curator at the Israel Eretz Israel Museum, said that it appears at first glance that all the coins are the same. Each coin has an eight-pointed star and an inscription reading 'King Alexander, Year 25' in Aramaic, while the other side of the coin has an anchor and in Greek reads, '[Coin of] King Alexander.' Researchers believe the style of this coin was prevalent in 80/79 BCE. The finding is extremely rare as very few coin hoards belonging to Alexander Jannaeus have been discovered and this marks one of the largest coin hoards of its kind ever uncovered in Israel. 'All of our students and volunteers were very excited to find this Hasmonean relic, especially during Hanukkah. This gave the holiday an added sense of significance, especially during this difficult time for the Jewish people. I hope that people will be drawn to visit this place and it will become a protected archaeological heritage site in Israel,' Dr. Bar said.

IDF Chief: No victory until northerners safely return home	A 'true victory' in the north includes economic recovery, strengthening of agriculture and other industries, says IDF head. By World Israel News Staff Israel has defeated the Hezbollah group militarily, but a 'true victory' will come when tens of thousands of displaced northerners can return to their communities, said IDF Chief of Staff Herzi HaLevi on Sunday. While touring the northern border with Lebanon, HaLevi praised Israeli soldiers for miliary achievements over Hezbollah, including singificantly crippling the terror group's ability to attack Israel. But, HaLevi said, more than a year of near-daily Hezbollah bombardment had taken a serious toll on the northern region. While a ceasefire officially came into effect in late November, some 70,000 northerners remain displaced. Thousands of businesses have been shuttered. Tourism - a major industry for the north - shows no signs yet of recovery. 'A victory, in the long run, is that there will be a lot of citizens, a lot of tourism, that the restaurants that were here, and the cafes, and the people who come to ride bicycles, and the agriculture here, will all thrive,' HaLevi said. 'And the state needs to step in, offer a very strong shoulder' to help revitalize the north's economy, HaLevi added. According to Israel’s Tax Authority, Hezbollah attacks caused 1.5 billion shekels ($407 million) in property damage alone. Many residents of the north have expressed pessimism over the 60-day ceasefire agreement, which is set to expire in late January, just after president-elect Donald Trump takes office. They have said that they will not return to their homes until Hezbollah suffers a decisive military defeat or surrenders, stating that they do not trust the terror group to abide by the terms of the agreement. A Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper recently published an editorial urging the terror group to resume hostilities against Israel. 'Although the people are tired of the war and do not want to be displaced again, the cost of confronting the occupation forces is lower than the cost of relying on what they are doing now,' wrote Ibrahim Al-Amine, a close personal friend of slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.

IDF secretly destroyed Iranian missile lab in Syria	Israeli commandos raided an Iranian-backed weapons manufacturing site, deep in Syrian territory, in late September. By World Israel News Staff Israeli commandos raided and destroyed an Iranian-backed research facility and missile manufacturing site in Syria in late September, prior to the flash rebel offensive that ousted longtime leader Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian defense industry's Scientific Studies and Research Center (CERS), where Iranian scientists worked, and an Iranian-established missile facility were targeted by the IDF in a covert operation, according to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Kan News. The IDF had been aware of sites for years, but began making plans to attack after intelligence indicated that advanced equipment was transferred from Iran to the missile manufacturing facility. The location of the sites is 200 kilometers north of the Syrian-Israel, near the city of Maysaf. Due to concerns over placing troops on the ground so deep inside of Syrian territory, the IDF initially tried to attack the facilities with airstrikes. However, attacks from the air proved to be ineffective. Fearing that the missile facility - which was under the control of the IRGC - would be used to supply weapons to Hezbollah, the defense establishment decided to move forward with the ground operation. Jerusalem warned the U.S. ahead of the mission that it was planning to carry out a brief raid on Syrian soil. Eva J. Koulouriotis, a Middle East researcher and expert on jihadi groups in the region, tweeted in September that Israel was behind a series of airstrikes that destroyed roads around CERS and prevented Syrian soldiers from defending the facility. According to Syria TV – a network affiliated with the country’s opposition movement – Israeli helicopters entered Syrian airspace in the early hours of the morning. The helicopters hovered over the compound as special forces units rappelled down ropes and conducted a surprise raid of the facility. According to Koulouriotis, Israeli troops seized critical equipment and documents, then planted explosives which were later detonated, destroying the center.

Biden: Trump won because I was forced to drop out of the race	Despite a disastrous debate and low approval ratings, Biden insists he would have beaten Trump in a head-to-head matchup. By World Israel News Staff Outgoing President Joe Biden is confident that he would have beaten president-elect Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup, and blames the Democratic party for pressuring him to drop out of the race, according to a Washington Post report. Biden, who showed clear signs of cognitive decline during a June debate against Trump, was essentially forced to end his campaign several weeks after his disastrous performance. But Biden is privately insisting to his aides and confidants that the Democrats' pressure on him to leave the race has proved to be a historic mistake. While 'aides say the president has been careful not to place blame on Harris or her campaign,' according to the Post report, Biden is charging that a Trump victory was not inevitable. Despite low approval ratings among the general public, Biden is sure that he would have beaten Trump. 'Let me say it as clear as I can: I'm staying in the race!' Biden said at a campaign rally shortly after the televised debate, in which he frequently appeared confused and delivered rambling, nonsensical answers. 'I’ll beat Donald Trump.' Notably, Biden initially misspoke, saying he would beat Trump in 2020, then corrected himself to say he would 'do it again in 2024.' Trump easily defeated Harris in the 2024 presidential election. He became the second Republican to win the popular vote since 1988. 'Inflation, immigration, some evidence of backlash against Democrats on identity politics, crime, education, and a public mood moving in a conservative direction all suggested a Republican win,' Wayne Steger, a DePaul University political scientist, told PBS. Many Democrats blamed Harris' loss on Biden's refusal to drop out of the race earlier. 'I think there was a real unique opportunity for President Biden to have this Washingtonian moment and show he wasn't in it for himself, he was in it to put, really, country and party over self,' Rep. Pat Ryan (D-NY) told CNN. 'And if he had done what he said during the campaign and talked about being a bridge to this new generation &#8230; I think if the president had given space of that, we might have had a different outcome,' he added.

Israeli spies discovered slain Hezbollah leader was juggling four...	Shukr was responsible for the attack on Majdal Shams that killed 12 children and was wanted by the US for the 1983 Beirut bombing that killed 241 US military personnel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli intelligence has discovered that slain Hezbollah terror commander Fuad Shukr had a relationship with four mistresses he married over the phone, the New York Post reports. Shukr, a leading figure in Hezbollah, was tracked for years by Israeli Intelligence who discovered he was juggling four mistresses, something he said he felt guilty about. Shukr reportedly sought a religious solution for his predicament with the four mistresses from Hashem Safieddine a successor to Nasrallah, who was also eventually eliminated. Safieddine came up with a solution to arrange four wedding ceremonies over the phone with each of the mistresses. The marriages would not last; Shukr was lured out of his hiding place in Beirut neighborhood of Dahiyeh with a phone call on July 30 and was eliminated. Shukr was killed along with at least one of his wives, two children and two other women. Shukr was responsible for the attack on Majdal Shams that killed 12 children and is wanted by the US for the 1983 bombing of the US Marine Corps barracks in Beirut in an attack that killed 241 US Service personnel. The US had put a $5 million bounty on the head of Fuad Shukr. In addition, Shukr was a chief advisor to Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah and was the mastermind of the cross-border offensive that killed 8 IDF soldiers, kidnapped 2 others and started the 2006 Israel Lebanon War. He was also instrumental in building Hezbollah’s arsenal from 15,000 to some 150,000 missiles, making it the best-armed nonstate actor in the region. Shukr played a pivotal role in smuggling in Iranian weapons through Syria. Hours after Fuad Shukr was assassinated in Beirut, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran, reportedly by an explosion that was planted where he was staying months earlier and detonated by operatives within IRGC ranks.

Syria’s de facto leader says holding elections could take up to f...	Drafting a new constitution could take up to three years, the Syrian leader said. By Reuters Holding elections in Syria could take up to four years, Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said in an interview with Al Arabiya on Sunday, the first time he has commented on a possible timetable for elections since Bashar al-Assad was ousted this month. Drafting a new constitution could take up to three years, Sharaa said in excerpts from the interview with the Saudi state-owned broadcaster. He also said it would take about a year for Syrians to see drastic changes. Sharaa leads the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that ousted Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8, ending decades of Assad family rule and a 13-year civil war. He said HTS will be dissolved in a national dialogue conference. On foreign ties, Sharaa said Syria has strategic interests with Russia. Russia has military bases in Syria, was a close Assad ally during the long civil war and has granted Assad asylum. Sharaa said earlier this month that Syria's relations with Russia should serve common interests. Sharaa also said he hopes the administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will lift sanctions imposed on Syria. Senior U.S. diplomats who visited Damascus this month said Sharaa came across as pragmatic and that Washington has decided to remove a $10 million bounty on the HTS leader's head.

Interpol issues arrest warrant for Lev Tahor leader	Cardona Castillo has been identified by police and prosecutors as a leader of the group, which has about 200-300 members. By JNS Interpol has issued an international arrest warrant for a leader of the Lev Tahor Jewish cult. Jonathan Emmanuel Cardona Castillo, 23, is wanted by Guatemala on charges including human trafficking, rape and abuse of minors, the international police organization said in a Red Notice. Cardona Castillo is a citizen of Guatemala and El Salvador, and speaks Hebrew and Spanish, according to the notice. He is described as being 5.6 feet tall, weighs about 190 pounds and has black hair and black eyes. Lev Tahor, or 'Pure Heart' in Hebrew, is a fundamentalist Jewish cult that Guatemalan authorities say engages in child sexual abuse, pedophilia and rape. The organization, which has been described as the 'Jewish Taliban,' was founded in Jerusalem in 1988 by the anti-Zionist Rabbi Shlomo Helbrans. Its members moved from Israel to the U.S. and back before heading to Canada, Guatemala and Mexico, often fleeing child welfare agencies. They have also stayed in several Eastern European countries as well as Turkey for shorter periods. The cult follows an extreme fundamentalist form of Jewish practice including head to toe black coverings for girls and women from the age of three. Cardona Castillo has been identified by police and prosecutors as a leader of the group, which has about 200-300 members. Earlier this month, Guatemalan authorities raided the compound of the radical ultra-Orthodox sect, taking at least 160 minors into protective custody amid allegations of abuse.

New Israeli airline challenges El Al’s stranglehold on U.S. route...	TechAir’s flights will depart Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport at midnight and land at New York’s JFK Airport early the next morning. By Jewish Breaking News For Americans looking for direct flights to Israel after months of limited options, there is hope as a new carrier prepares to enter the market. TechAir has announced it will launch direct flights between New York’s JFK Airport and Tel Aviv starting January 21. The new service will operate an Airbus A330-900 with 300 seats and offer round-trip fares starting at $1,550 during an initial 72-hour presale period. While this pricing sits above TechAir’s original target of $1,350, it remains more economical than El Al’s direct flights and provides a faster alternative to routes with layovers operated by European carriers. A new airline offers a much-needed alternative to El Al’s current monopoly on direct U.S.-Israel routes currently commanding a whopping 71% traffic through Ben Gurion airport. According to CTECH, TechAir’s flights will depart Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport at midnight and land at New York’s JFK Airport early the next morning. However, in order for the service to stay operational past March, it needs to sustain at least 35% seat occupancy. Meanwhile, U.S. carriers remain absent from Israeli airspace. United Airlines has suspended operations indefinitely, while American Airlines has canceled flights until at least March 2025. Delta has announced plans to resume service in April 2025, though their projected fares of $1,732 for summer travel exceed current market rates by several hundred dollars. Connecting through Europe also isn’t an easy task anymore as most European airlines are pushing their return dates into 2025. British Airways won’t fly until late March, while Air France eyes a mid-January restart. The Lufthansa Group, including Swiss and Austrian Airlines, has paused all Israel routes through January. Spanish carrier Vueling remains grounded until January, alongside Italy’s ITA Airways which won’t fly until month’s end. Ryanair has taken Israel completely off its schedule through April, while easyJet and Dutch airline Transavia have suspended operations until spring. Croatia Airlines has yet to announce when it might return to Israeli skies. However, some European carriers have already returned to Israeli skies. Among those currently operating are TAROM, Aegean Airlines, Bulgaria Air, Air Europa, and several smaller carriers including Electra Airways, GullivAir, and FlyOne. However, their options remain significantly reduced compared to prewar schedules.

Gazan terrorists fire five rockets at Israel	The Israeli Air Force on Saturday downed two rockets launched by Palestinian terrorists in northern Gaza towards Jerusalem. By JNS Palestinian terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip fired five rockets on Sunday at Israeli communities in the 'Gaza Envelope,' the area near the coastal enclave. Two rockets were intercepted, according to the Israel Defense Forces, with the others apparently hitting open areas. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The Israeli Air Force on Saturday downed two rockets launched by Palestinian terrorists in northern Gaza towards Jerusalem. The attacks triggered air-raid sirens in the capital, the Western Negev and the Judean Foothills (the Shfela). There were no reports of injuries. Overnight, IAF fighter jets targeted the launchers involved in Saturday’s rocket attack, supported by firepower from the 933rd 'Nahal' Brigade operating in the Strip. 'The targeted launchers contained a rocket ready for launch towards Israel,' the IDF said on Sunday morning. 'Following the strike, a rocket was observed being fired from the launch site.' The IDF’s year-plus-long offensive against Hamas has greatly curbed rocket fire from the Strip, although Palestinian terrorists still intermittently target the Jewish state.

Israel bombs Hamas command center in abandoned Gaza hospital	Israeli jet planes bomb Hamas base inside abandoned Gaza City hospital, while 240 terrorists were arrested in another hospital in the northern Gaza Strip. By Pesach Benson, TPS Fighter jets struck a Hamas position in an abandoned Gaza hospital compound on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces said. The IDF said the squad, part of Hamas’s Shejaya Battalion, maintained a command and control center inside the former Al-Wafa Hospital in Gaza City. The army added that Hamas also operated an air defense system from the grounds of the former medical center. 'The complex was used by the terrorists to plan and execute terrorist plots against IDF forces in the immediate future,' the army said. 'This is another example of the systematic violation of international law by the Hamas terrorist organization, while brutally exploiting civilian institutions and the population as human shields for terrorist operations,' the IDF added. The IDF said it used precise munitions, aerial surveillance and other measures to mitigate collateral damage to civilians. On Saturday, the army arrested 240 terrorists in the Kamal Adwan Hospital in the northern Gaza town of Jabaliya, where Hamas has been trying to regroup. Troops seized grenades, guns, ammunition and other military equipment found inside the hospital complex. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

By World Israel News Staff A Democratic lawmaker from Florida announced Friday she has left the Democratic Party and joined the Republican caucus, becoming the second Florida Democrat to bolt the party this month. Florida State Representative Hillary Cassel, an attorney who was represented the 101st district in the Florida House of Representatives since 2022, issued a statement Friday afternoon, announcing that she had changed her party affiliation. In the statement, Cassel, who is Jewish, accused the Democratic Party of failing to support Israel, and ripped the party’s progressive wing for condoning terrorism. 'As a proud Jewish woman, I have been increasingly troubled by the Democratic Party’s failure to unequivocally support Israel and its willingness to tolerate extreme progressive voices that justify or condone acts of terrorism.' 'I’m constantly troubled by the inability of the current Democratic Party to relate to everyday Floridians. I can no longer remain in a party that doesn’t represent my values.' The announcement comes on the heels of another defection by a Florida Democrat. On December 9th, State Rep. Susan Valdés switched her affiliation from Democrat to Republican, bolstering the GOP’s supermajority in the former battleground state’s House of Representatives. Former President and President-elect Donald Trump lauded Cassel 'Congratulations to Hillary Cassel for becoming the second State Representative from the Great State of Florida to switch her Party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, once more expanding the GOP Supermajority in the State House!' Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social account on Saturday. 'I would further like to invite other Disillusioned Democrats to switch Parties, and join us on this noble quest to Save our Country and, Make America Great Again - GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE.

What? Ancient latkes had no potato	Early latkes emerged as a tribute to Yehudit, a heroine of the Hanukkah story who used salty cheese to outmaneuver an Assyrian general. By Jewish Breaking News Ever wonder how potato latkes became the star of Hanukkah? The story might surprise you, as these Hannukah treats we all know and love weren’t always made from potatoes at all. Back in the day (we’re talking 12th century here), Jews were actually frying up cheese pancakes for Hanukkah. These early latkes emerged as a tribute to Yehudit, a heroine of the Hanukkah story who used salty cheese to outmaneuver an Assyrian general. Italian Jews ran with the inspiration, whipping up ricotta pancakes that became such a hit, they spread all across Europe, according to author Elizabeth Karpen of JewishUnpacked. When Jews moved east into places like Poland and Russia, olive oil and butter were hard to come by. Instead, everyone was cooking with rendered chicken or goose fat also known as 'schmaltz.' This created quite the dilemma for Jewish cooks since mixing dairy with animal fat wasn’t kosher. So they ditched the cheese and started experimenting with vegetables instead. However, when potatoes first showed up in Europe from the Americas in the 1600s, people literally thought they were just good for feeding animals. It took a couple of nasty famines in 1839 and 1840 for folks to change their minds. Once they realized potatoes were cheap, filling, and could grow just about anywhere, everything changed. As Jewish families started coming to America, they brought their potato latkes with them. These crispy treats found their way onto deli menus, and the rest is history. While plenty of people still swear by the classic potato version, you’ll find everything from sweet potato to zucchini latkes on Hanukkah tables these days, proving that some traditions never stop evolving.

Israeli boy discovers medallion during Jerusalem field trip	Accidentally discovered during a school field trip, the relic highlights Christian pilgrimages to the Holy Land, and one Jerusalem neighborhood in particular. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli schoolboy discovered a 100-200 year-old medallion in southern Jerusalem recently, during a field trip to the Ein Karem (Ein Kerem) neighborhood Ten-year-old Nehorai Nir recently went on a class trip to picturesque Ein Karem in Jerusalem as a student in Jerusalem’s Argentina Experimental High School in Kiryat Hayovel. 'We were picking edible plants, and I was surprised to see on the slope below me on a beautiful red pomegranate lying there on the ground,' Nir recounts. 'I ran to pick it up and discovered a worm inside, so I reluctantly put it down—but on the way back up the hill I suddenly saw a colorful object shining in the dirt. I pulled it out and was immediately very excited. The staff told me to call the Israel Antiquities Authority, and when they came, they were very enthused.' The find, a beautiful golden medallion made with a micro-mosaic technique, was examined by Dr. Amit Re’em, Jerusalem District Archaeologist of the Israel Antiquities Authority. 'This cross medallion is not considered an antiquity by law as it is ‘only’ 100-200 hundred years old or so, but it is a unique object. The manufacturing method demanded expert craftsmanship which includes setting glass and tiny colorful precious stones, placed with exceeding precision to form miniature patterns.' 'This technique was developed in Rome about the year 1800 or slightly earlier, And continued until the early 20th century. Besides its beauty, the significance of this medallion is embedded in its findspot—Ein Karem, a site venerated by Christianity. Ein Karem is venerated by Christians because it is identified with the 'town in Judah' where the New Testament places the birth of John the Baptist, and where the text says his mother Elizabeth, while pregnant, met Jesus’ mother, Miriam. It is against this background that two churches were established in Ein Karem, the Church of the Visitation and the Church of Saint John. They drew generations of pilgrims from across Europe to make Ein Karem a central pilgrimage site, as they made their way from the coastal port cities up to the Old City of Jerusalem. 'This cross is a testament to the personal story of a pilgrim who visited Ein Karem 100–200 years ago, reflecting the centrality of the Holy Land to the three monotheistic religions,' added Dr. Re’em. 'People were willing to cross deserts, mountains, and seas, often over the course of years, just to touch the soil where it all began. The cross may have arrived with a pilgrim from Europe and fallen during their journey in the Land of Israel, or perhaps it was purchased here in Jerusalem.' 'When Nehorai shared the story of the discovery, one could almost imagine the moment the pendant was lost—only to be found by the boy about a century later.' 'I would like to personally thank Nehorai for his alertness and his prompt report of the medallion’s discovery, said Eli Escusido, Israel Antiquities Authority Director. 'This exciting find in the very month that Christians celebrate Christmas puts the spotlight on Ein Karem as a central place of Christian pilgrimage in the Land of Israel. Through the medium of a small but unique object, we are exposed to the story of one individual’s thrilling personal journey, which connects us to the past history of this site and to the world of the pilgrims.'

Israel used many agents to kill Haniyeh in Iran	Hours before the intended detonation time, the air conditioner malfunctioned in Haniyeh’s room where the bomb had been planted, causing Israeli operation planners to fear he would be assigned a different room. By JNS The targeted killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July was the result of an intelligence and sabotage operation that required several Iranian agents and more than five conspirators, Israeli experts told a local television channel in an exposé aired on Saturday. 'This thing required a whole execution network that apparently included people who betrayed their country or their mission,' Maj. Gen. (res.) Tamir Heyman, the director of the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University and a former head of the IDF Military Intelligence Directorate, told Channel 12. Benny Sabati, an Iran researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, or INSS, told Channel 12: 'There was a network. This couldn’t have been the work of just four-five people on the inside.' Haniyeh, who headed the Hamas politburo from Qatar, was killed in an explosion at a luxurious Revolutionary Guard guest house in the Iranian capital. He stayed there on a regular basis, including in July for the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. Iranian security officials first thought that the explosion that killed Haniyeh and his bodyguard came from a missile but then realized a bomb had been planted in or near the bed of his regular room at the facility, Ronen Bergman, a writer for The New York Times and Yediot Achronot who specializes in intelligence, told Channel 12. Hours before the intended detonation time, the air conditioner malfunctioned in Haniyeh’s room where the bomb had been planted, causing Israeli operation planners to fear he would be assigned a different room. But the unit was repaired. The Mossad did not have on hand a bomb with the desired amount of explosives. It planted a slightly larger one, which did not affect other rooms but did blow a hole in the building’s façade, Channel 12 reported. The operation was postponed at least twice, including once so it would occur after the inauguration instead of ahead of it, Bergman told Channel 12. Hamas commander Khalil al-Hayya discovered Haniyeh’s bloodied remains and wept over them immediately after the explosion, according to the report. Iran fired rockets into Israel on Oct. 1, calling it a retaliation for the assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut in September and for the assassination of Haniyeh. The Iranian strikes resulted in limited damage. Israel struck back, reportedly taking out key components of Iran’s air defenses. Haniyeh was involved in the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of Israel, when thousands of its terrorists murdered some 1,200 people and abducted another 250. Israel launched an ongoing military campaign to remove Hamas from the Gaza Strip, killing its top command as well as about 17,000 terrorists, according to INSS estimates.

Netanyahu to be hospitalized for prostate removal	Israeli prime minister to undergo surgery for the removal of his prostate, requiring hospitalization lasting 'several days,' cancellation of his planned court testimony this week. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will undergo surgery Sunday to remove his prostate, the Prime Minister's Office announced Saturday. The surgery was scheduled after a recent examination, during which doctors found that Netanyahu had an enlarged prostate, which was linked to a urinary tract infection. 'Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underwent an examination at Hadassah Hospital in the course of which was discovered a urinary tract infection stemming from a benign enlargement of his prostate,' the Prime Minister's Office said. 'Since then, for several days, the Prime Minister has been treated with antibiotics which have successfully dealt with the infection.' 'As a result, Prime Minister Netanyahu will undergo treatment tomorrow to remove his prostate.' The operation will take place at Hadassah Medical Center, with Netanyahu forced to remain hospitalized for several days, according to his attorney Amit Hadad. On Sunday, the Jerusalem District Court accepted a request filed by Hadad on Netanyahu's behalf, asking that the prime minister be exempted from his scheduled testimony this week. Since December 10th, the prime minister has been required by the court to testify weekly, Monday through Wednesday, despite the ongoing war against Hamas, tensions in Lebanon, and the escalating conflict with the Yemenite Houthis, including a recent string of missile attacks against Israel. Netanyahu will be required to resume his testimony next Monday, January 6th. In his letter to the court, Hadad wrote that doctors estimate that Netanyahu will need to be hospitalized for anywhere from one night to as long as three nights following Sunday's procedure. Prostatectomy is a routine procedure with a relatively low risk of infections and complications.

Report: IDF may remain in Lebanon beyond ceasefire	Amid concerns Lebanese army is dragging its feet in redeployment to southern Lebanon and following discoveries of hidden Hezbollah weapon caches, Israel reportedly mulls extending its stay in Lebanon beyond deadline. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military may stay in southern Lebanon beyond the deadline for its withdrawal, according to a report Sunday morning. On November 27th, a 60-day ceasefire - brokered by France and the United States - went into effect in Lebanon, ostensibly halting the fighting between Israel and the Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah, after nearly 14 months of fighting. Throughout the truce, however, Israel has continued to use military force against Hezbollah forces, accusing the Shi'ite group of violating the agreement. Hezbollah terrorists have also launched attacks on Israel during the ceasefire, including a bombardment of the Har Dov area. Now, Jerusalem is considering extending the IDF's deployment in southern Lebanon beyond the January 27th deadline, which under the November agreement was to have marked the end of Israel's presence in Lebanese territory. However, according to an Israel Hayom report, Israeli leaders are dismayed by the 'sluggish deployment' of the Lebanese military in southern Lebanon, calling into question Beirut's commitment to its obligations under the November agreement to police all of Lebanese territory and ensure the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from the area south of the Litani River. Israel, the report said, is uncertain whether the delays are the result of the Lebanese army's inability to undertake a large redeployment - or if instead it is a sign of Beirut's unwillingness to confront Hezbollah, a powerful political and paramilitary force in the country with strong backing from Iran. Jerusalem has repeatedly registered complaints with international observers over the Lebanese army's failure to meet deadlines for its south Lebanon deployment. In addition, Israeli forces have uncovered extensive Hezbollah infrastructure and weapons caches in southern Lebanon over the weekend, fueling concerns that a significant portion of the terror group's military capacity has yet to be discovered. Adding to this reports that Iran is considering opening direct air supply routes to Hezbollah via Beirut's international airport, Israel's top brass is increasingly concerned a January withdrawal from southern Lebanon could enable Hezbollah to reestablish itself on Israel's northern border. Israel has yet to decide whether to extend the IDF's deployment in Lebanon, however, and Jerusalem is planning to discuss the possibility with both the outgoing Biden administration and incoming Trump administration, which is set to take office a week before the January 27th deadline.

IDF ignored clues which could have saved six hostages – report	Farhan al-Qadi told his rescuers that he had heard Hebrew spoken but army kept fighting and Hamas executed them. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF ignored a clear hint that there were hostages in their area of operations in Gaza in the summer and eventually the group of six were executed by their Hamas captors fearing discovery, Channel 12 reported Saturday. Farhan al-Qadi, a Bedouin whom Hamas fighters had been abducted on October 7 along with 250 others during their invasion of Israel, was found in a tunnel in Rafah on August 27. He told his rescuers that a few weeks before his liberation he had heard a woman saying 'Good morning' in Hebrew in a tunnel nearby. He then repeated his assertion to debriefers from Israeli Intelligence a short time later. However, his testimony was doubted, the report said, with the army thinking that he had not heard the voice correctly or that he had been moved to a tunnel further away. IDF forces continued fighting Hamas terrorists in the same zone, pausing operations in the Tel Sultan neighborhood only on August 31, in a rethink of the possibility that other hostages may indeed be hidden under the ground there. Several hours later, they found the bodies of six abductees in a narrow, fetid tunnel about a kilometer away from where al-Qadi had been found alone in an underground cell. Forensic evidence showed that St. Sgt. Ori Danino, Carmel Gat, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lubanov, Almog Sarusi, and Eden Yerushalmi had been shot and killed on October 29. The security services believed that their captors followed an instruction by then-Hamas head Yahya Sinwar to execute captives rather than risk them being saved by approaching IDF forces, a general order given to his forces after four hostages were rescued from the Nuseirat refugee camp in June. There were also forensic findings of Sinwar having been in the same tunnel as the six at some point, although it was unknown if he had been present at the time of their execution, using them as human shields. The Channel 12 report came five days after the IDF formally gave the findings of its investigation into the death of the six hostages to their families. In it, they said that they had ceased operations for 24 hours after finding al-Qadi accidentally, in order to assess whether there could be other hostages in the area. They had concluded that the likelihood of that was 'medium to low,' saying that they had had no solid intelligence indicating otherwise.

‘We underestimated the Houthis,’ admit Israeli officials	The costs of intercepting Houthi missiles and drones are proving to be a serious challenge for Israel. By World Israel News Staff Israel's security and defense establishments are belatedly coming to grips with the threat posed by the Houthis, nearly 14 months after Hamas' brutal terror onslaught on southern Israel kicked off a multifront war, according to a Washington Post report. After the October 7th attacks, Israeli strategists were primarily focused on combatting the threats on the border - Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon - and were initially less concerned about the Yemen-based Houthis. But as a shaky ceasefire with Hezbollah holds and Hamas' capabilities to attack Israel have been curbed, the Houthis - who are the last remaining Iranian proxy in the region - have ramped up their attacks against Israel. Earlier in December, two incidents saw ballistic missiles fired by the Houthis strike central Israel, destroying a Ramat Gan school and impacting in a south Tel Aviv park, wounding 16. The Houthis 'are more technologically advanced than perceived by many' and should not be 'underrated,' an Israeli security official, speaking anonymously, told the Washington Post. Thanks to financial and logistical support from Iran, including supplying missiles and explosive drones, the Houthis have been able to take 'practical steps' towards their goal of destroying Israel, the official added. 'The Houthis want a war of attrition on Israel, to continue firing so that they can say, ‘We are the real resistance,'' Yoel Guzansky, a former member of Israel’s National Security Council and senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, told the Post. Guzansky noted that the costs of interceptions, both from a fiscal and technological perspective, are proving to be a serious challenge for Israel. 'Because it’s so cheap for [the Houthis] to try to get a drone or a missile every few days or weeks into Israel, they can win this,' he said. 'The question is now, how does Israel avoid falling into their trap?' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently vowed that Israel would defeat the Houthis, hinting that Jerusalem would target the terror group's leadership.

Iranian plot to kidnap Israeli journalist thwarted	IRGC tried to force childhood friend of Iranian-born Israeli reporter to lure him to Turkey, planned abduction. By World Israel News Staff Iran planned to abduct an Israeli reporter by luring him to Turkey under false pretenses, according to a bombshell new report. News outlet Iranvir reported that the IRGC had attempted to force a childhood friend of Babak Itzhaki, an Iranian-born Israeli journalist, to convince him to travel to Turkey. From there, IRGC operatives planned to kidnap Itzhaki and transport him to Iran. The plan failed when Itzhaki's friend refused to participate in the plot, leading to a five year prison sentence. Itzhaki, an Iranian-born reporter, immigrated to Israel in his early twenties. He is a correspondent for Iran International, an English and Farsi language outlet providing an alternative to news controlled by the Islamic regime. 'Iran International is the free voice of independent news in Iran, and for over seven years, my colleagues and I have been reporting the truth of what is happening in Israel to the Iranian people without censorship. This, of course, greatly angers the Iranian regime, which does not want the people to know the truth,' Itzhaki told Kan News. The Iranian government has repeatedly targeted Iran International journalists, he said. Itzhaki told Channel 12 News that one of his colleagues was stabbed in London, and that the Mossad had warned British police of an Iranian plot to bomb Iran International's London offices. Iranians who 'want to know what's really going on' watch the channel, which is 'what caused the regime to try to shut us down, weaken us, and threaten us.' The reporter stressed that 'neither threats nor acts of terror will stop our reporting of the truth.' He added that 'threats against me are threats against all journalists who uphold free journalism, and I expect all journalistic organizations to issue a statement condemning attacks and threats by the Iranian regime against journalists.'

Hezbollah newspaper agitates for return to war against Israel	Hezbollah is the only party that can 'confront the arrogance of the Israeli enemy,' claims outlet affiliated with the terror group. By World Israel News Staff Hezbollah must resume its attacks against Israel, urged an Op-Ed published in a Lebanese newspaper affiliated with the terror group. Ibrahim Al-Amine, the editor-in-chief of Al-Akhbar, claimed in a piece titled ''We must resist the enemy’s violations' that Israel had not honored the terms of the ceasefire agreement, which came into effect in late November. Al-Amine was a close personal friend of slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, and Al-Akhbar is widely known as an outlet used by the terror group for public relations campaigns. In the editorial, Al-Amine charged that Israel had 'destroyed' twice as many Lebanese border villages during the ceasefire than in the period of active warfare. Israel's targeting of threats to its national security, including ongoing airstrikes on Hezbollah terrorists preparing to launch explosive drones or rockets, constitutes a gross violation of the ceasefire agreement, he argued. Without providing sources or names, Al-Amine claimed that 'international' and 'European' officials had said that Israel's recent actions in Lebanon justified a 'reprisal' from Hezbollah. Lebanese officials who are concerned about Hezbollah's violation of the ceasefire, including maintaining its operatives' presence south of the Litani River, are 'adopting the enemy's narrative,' he wrote. Hezbollah is the 'only party that can address and confront the haughtiness and arrogance of the [Israeli] enemy,' Al-Amine stressed. He added that 'resistance' - armed attacks - against Israel was the only effective method for ensuring that civilians can return to their homes in southern Lebanon. 'Although the people are tired of the war and do not want to be displaced again, the cost of confronting the occupation forces is lower than the cost of relying on what they are doing now,' Al-Amine concluded. The 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah is set to expire in late January 2025, shortly after president-elect Donald Trump assumes office.

Raped, starved, branded, and left in total darkness – ex-hostages...	Testimonies of returned hostages collected by Israel's Health Ministry submitted in report to the UN reveals systematic sexual, physical, and psychological torture of captives, along with intentional starvation, branding of skin with hot metal objects, and refusal of medical treatment. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Gaza terrorists holding Israelis and foreign nationals captive following the invasion of southwestern Israel on October 7th systematically abused them and intentionally starved or denied medical treatment to many of their victims, according to the testimony of returned hostages. On Saturday, the Israeli Health Ministry published its report to United Nations Special Rapporteur Alice Edwards, submitted last Monday, which provides details on the allegations lodged by former hostages against Hamas terrorists and others who held them captive in the Gaza Strip after October 7th. The report, which does not cite individual former captives, is based upon the testimony of returned hostages, most of whom were released during the November 2023 ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. According to the report, the psychological and physical abuse of hostages - including sexual assault and torture - was common during their captivity, as was the denial of critical medical care and even food, with many captives intentionally starved. 'Women, men, and children who returned from captivity reported that they endured severe physical and sexual abuse, such as beatings, isolation, deprivation of food and water, branding, hair-pulling, and sexual assault,' the report said. 'Additionally, some of them reported that the captors sexually assaulted them or forced them to undress.' One hostage reported being raped by a Hamas terrorist at gunpoint, while multiple women said their captors sexually assaulted them. 'In addition, some women reported that they were tied to beds while their captors stared at them.' 'On several occasions, captors forced women of all ages to undress while others, including the captors, watched.' One woman who was injured during the October 7th invasion was tied up, preventing her from moving, while she was held in total darkness for 30 days. As with many of the captives, she was denied medical care and was kept on a starvation diet. 'Other women also reported starvation and abuse by their captors.' The male captives, the report continued, were subjected to 'severe physical abuse,' and deliberate acts of humiliation, 'including continuous starvation, beatings, burns with galvanized iron (branding), hair-pulling, confinement in closed rooms with a limited amount of food and water, being held in isolation with hands and feet tied, and being denied access to the bathroom, which forced them to defecate on themselves.' Multiple children were tortured during captivity, with the report noting 'signs of binding, scars, and marks consistent with trauma.' 'Two young children had burn marks on their lower limbs. One child stated that the burns were the result of a deliberate branding with a heated object.' 'Both the child and adults who were with him in captivity described the incident as a purposeful branding event, not an accident. It was described as an extremely traumatic experience.' Many captives were subjected to 'solitary confinement, poor sanitation, severe medical neglect, lack of sleep, starvation, sexual abuse, violence, threats, and brainwashing through media designed to break their spirit and make them submissive.' Roughly half of the returned hostages said they were 'deliberately starved during their captivity.' 'They were given a poor diet, which often led to hunger that worsened over time. In addition to inadequate nutrition, they were kept in dark spaces, increasing the risk of vitamin D deficiency.' 'This malnutrition resulted in an average weight loss of 8-15 kg (10-17% of body weight), with children losing an average of 10%, and in one extreme case, a girl lost 18% of her body weight.' Infections and other illnesses, resulting from the poor sanitary conditions, starvation, and denial of medical treatment, were rampant, the report said. 'Many suffered from diarrhea, abdominal pain, and sometimes constipation. They had limited access to showers and returned with skin infections, including Dermatitis.' 'Infections were detected in hospital cultures (Clostridium, Salmonella, Vibrio, Shigella, Giardia, E. coli). Some were diagnosed with Q fever, while two returned hostages suffered from acute case of Q fever. Several of the elderly women developed Deep Venous Thrombosis due to age, pre-existing medical conditions without medication, and lack of mobility during captivity.' 'Many hostages also suffered from untreated chronic conditions (e.g., heart failure, diabetes, hypothyroidism), leading to severe short-term medical deterioration, such as low blood pressure, bradycardia, and hypothermia.' 'In one case a hostage died from untreated medical complications. Also, several older women required urgent life-saving treatment due to untreated hypertension and hypothyroidism.' Israeli Health Minister Uriel Busso (Shas) called the report a 'wake-up call for the international community.' 'The report we are submitting to the UN is a harrowing testimony to the brutal experiences suffered by the hostages in Hamas captivity—cruel violence, psychological abuse, physical torment, and acts that defy comprehension,' said Busso. 'These actions cannot be tolerated and demand that the world awaken and take action. The report highlights the horrors endured by the hostages and reveals the brutality of the enemy with whom Israel is engaged.' 'The testimonies presented in this report serve as a wake-up call for the international community to apply increased pressure on Hamas and its supporters to release all hostages without delay. I urge the global community to utilize all available means to end this cruelty and bring the hostages home immediately. It is a moral and humanitarian imperative, and the time to act is running out.'

Gaza rockets fired at Jerusalem, IDF calls for urgent evacuation	The attack triggered air-raid sirens in the capital, the Western Negev and the the Judean Foothills. By JNS The Israeli Air Force on Saturday downed two rockets fired by Palestinian terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip towards Jerusalem. The attack triggered air-raid sirens in the capital, the Western Negev and the the Judean Foothills. Following the rocket fire, the military again called on Palestinians to evacuate parts of the northern Strip. 'Urgent warning to all those who have not yet evacuated the area specified in the map, and the Beit Hanun area [in the Strip’s northeast] in particular,' Col. Avichay Adraee, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman, posted to X. 'This area has been warned many times in the past. The IDF is operating in this area with force. You must evacuate the area immediately and move south towards Salah El Din Road. Moving via another road exposes you to danger,' he added. On Dec. 11, Palestinian terrorists in Gaza fired four rockets at southern Israel, setting off sirens in several towns and villages along the border. The Israel Defense Forces intercepted two of the rockets, with the others impacting in open areas, causing no damage. On Dec. 3, the IAF intercepted one rocket fired from northern Gaza. The IDF’s year-plus-long offensive against Hamas in the enclave has greatly curbed rocket fire from the Strip, although Palestinian terrorists still intermittently target the Jewish state.

Jonathan Pollard Explores Knesset Run	Pollard is reaching out to voters who are disillusioned with Netanyahu and Naftali Bennett. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Jonathan Pollard, the outspoken former spy who spent 30 years in a US prison, is considering a Knesset run. In the past few weeks, Pollard has met with current ministers, candidates and other public figures such as Brig. Gen. (Res.) Ofer Winter and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Pollard is reaching out to voters who are disillusioned with current Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the former premier Naftali Bennett. Pollard's focus is right-leaning voters, both religious and secular. Pollard characterized his platform: 'My goal is to unite those in the ideological right who love Israel and want to contribute to the state.' 'National service, whether in the IDF or another framework, is a critical issue for me. Everyone, without exception, must serve the state in some way,' he continued. Pollard's staunch stand on National Service includes a proposal to suspend voting rights of those who refuse to serve. He said, 'You can pray and study Torah, but you cannot refuse to contribute to the state.' Although Pollard stated that one of his goals is to unite the political right, he expressed an unwillingness to work with Naftali Bennett. Pollard said,'I don’t see any possibility of cooperating with Bennett. I don’t believe him after he promised his voters he wouldn’t align with the left, and then formed a government with them.' He added, 'Politics is politics, but honesty and loyalty to your promises are fundamental, and that’s what Bennett lacks.' Last year, speaking to students who combine Torah study with army service Pollard said, Last month, speaking in Haifa to students who combine Torah study with army service, he had said, 'The army must undergo a reform and a fundamental change from within. The change must be carried out in two ways: from the top down, and from the bottom up…. replacing the Chief of Staff and changing the face of the entire General Staff so that the new spirit will change first at the top of the system and will trickle down to the last of the soldiers as well.'

IDF raids Gaza hospital used as terror base	The IDF evacuated 350 patients and medical professionals from the facility prior to the raid. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF and Israel's security forces confirmed they arrested over 240 terrorists at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, northern Gaza on Friday. The military activity followed an intelligence report that the hospital was embedded with terrorists. Working in coordination with COGAT, the IDF completed an evacuation of 350 patients and medical professionals from the facility prior to the raid. Israel's military also ensured the delivery of food, fuel and medical supplies to keep the treatment areas functioning. In addition, 95 patients and staff were transferred to the Indonesian hospital in Gaza along with two generators and thousands of liters of essential supplies. The 401st brigade, located around the perimeter of the hospital,arrested terrorists and eliminated those who attacked troops or resisted arrest. Israeli special forces found in the hospital an arsenal of weapons, including grenades, firearms, and other military equipment. Terrorists attempted anti-tank missile and RPG attacks but were neutralized by IDF soldiers The IAF launched airstrikes against terrorists attempting to flee the hospital. On Tuesday,The IDF eliminated five terrorists and arrested dozens more at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza. According to the military and Israel’s security agency (Shin Bet), at least one of the eliminated terrorists had taken part in the October 7 massacre. The mission was carried out by the Givati ​​Brigade under the command of Division 162, based on military intelligence.

The top 10 Jewish sports moments of 2024	Here are the top Jewish sports moments of 2024, presented chronologically — including two on the same day! By Jacob Gurvis, JTA From the baseball diamond to the soccer pitch, from Vancouver to Paris, 2024 was a historic year for Jews in sports. Jewish athletes distinguished themselves across events, venues and tiers of competition — from the Olympics to the major leagues to college ball. This year also saw notable sports moments off the field, be they in the front office or during the commercial breaks. Some of the year’s top moments featured familiar stars in the Jewish sports world, like ace pitcher Max Fried, Olympian Jessica Fox and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Fans also met some up-and-coming Jewish athletes, like college football player Sam Salz, or watched familiar faces like BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff and USC basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb reach new heights. Here are our top Jewish sports moments of 2024, presented chronologically — including two on the same day! The fight against antisemitism gets the spotlight in a Super Bowl ad As more than 100 million people tuned in to watch Super Bowl LVIII on Feb. 11, they saw what is believed to be the first-ever Super Bowl ad focused on antisemitism. The New England Patriots weren’t in the big game, but their owner, Robert Kraft, paid an estimated $7 million for the 30-second spot by his charity, the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism. The ad featured Clarence B. Jones, the former lawyer and advisor to Martin Luther King Jr. who drafted King’s famous 1963 'I Have A Dream' speech. It drew mixed reviews. The ad was one of a series by FCAS, which is known for its '#StandUpToJewishHate' campaign, that sought to promote the fight against antisemitism by connecting it to other forms of discrimination. The group placed a number of TV ads during popular televised events this year, including one spot depicting a real-life synagogue bomb threat, which aired during the Oscars. Another, about antisemitism at campus protests, aired during the NBA playoffs. And a recent ad calling for a 'timeout against hate' featured sports icons including Shaquille O’Neal and Billie Jean King. Jessica Fox, with two more golds, steals the show in Paris Jewish and Israeli athletes won a slew of medals in Paris this summer — 18 at the Olympics and 13 more at the Paralympics. Jews took home medals in rugby, fencing, track, swimming and numerous other competitions, while Israel returned to Olympic soccer for the first time since 1976. One of the brightest Jewish stars of the Games was Australian paddling legend Jessica Fox, who won two gold medals in three days, bringing her career total to six, half of them golds. She won gold in both the canoe single and the kayak slalom. Fox is the most decorated Olympic canoe slalom competitor ever, and the only Australian Olympian in history with six individual medals. She had served as one of Australia’s flag bearers at the Paris opening ceremony. And the magic didn’t stop there. Fox’s younger sister, Noemie Fox, earned a gold medal of her own in the inaugural kayak cross event. The win put the Fox sisters in rare company among Jewish siblings to medal at the same Olympics. Amit Elor wrestles her way to Olympic history A Jewish Olympian dominated on the wrestling mat as well as the water: Amit Elor, a California native with Israeli parents, entered Paris as the youngest U.S. Olympic wrestler in history, and left as its youngest medalist in the sport. Elor, an eight-time world champion, made quick work of her opponents, extending her undefeated streak of five years with a gold medal win. Elor, the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors who moved to Israel, experienced both online antisemitism and the sudden deaths of both her father and a brother during the years when she broke into the elite ranks of U.S. women’s wrestling. She wrestles at the 68-kilogram weight class and in October 2023 became the youngest American wrestler — male or female — ever to win a senior world title. After her win, Elor spoke out against antisemitism — something she had largely avoided in the lead-up to Paris. 'Eighty years ago my grandparents survived the Holocaust, but antisemitism is still all around us,' Elor said in a video posted on social media. The clip showed a comment directed against her saying 'you belong in the gas chamber.' 3 Jewish players appear in one MLB at-bat Pitcher Max Lazar’s first career strikeout on Aug. 10 was special for more than one reason. Lazar, a Jewish Philadelphia Phillies rookie, was pitching to Jewish catcher Garrett Stubbs and struck out Diamondbacks designated hitter Joc Pederson, who is also Jewish. The moment marked a rare trifecta — in which the pitcher, catcher and batter were all Jewish. (Stubbs and Pederson both played for Team Israel at the 2023 World Baseball Classic.) According to the Jewish Baseball Museum, it was only the third instance of a Jewish pitcher-catcher-batter combination in MLB’s more than 100-year history. And Stubbs and Lazar made up only the eighth-ever Jewish pitcher-catcher pairing, known as a battery. It wasn’t Stubbs’ first historic moment of the season. In July, with the Phillies trailing the Oakland Athletics, Stubbs took the mound, faced fellow Team Israel alum Zack Gelof — and gave up a grand slam. It was the first-ever grand slam hit by a Jewish batter off a Jewish pitcher. USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb notches her 300th career basketball win University of Southern California women’s basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb has established herself as one of the sport’s best. Gottlieb, who in 2019 became the first women’s collegiate head coach to join an NBA staff, led USC to the No. 1 seed in the NCAA March Madness tournament this year after winning the Pac-12 Conference’s last-ever women’s championship (the conference since dissolved). USC made it to the Elite Eight in the Big Dance before losing to the University of Connecticut. In April, Gottlieb signed a contract extension with USC that will keep her at the helm through the 2029-2030 season. And this season, USC is off to another strong start, now in the Big Ten. On Nov. 12, Gottlieb reached another milestone: her 300th career coaching win, a 124-39 rout over Cal State Northridge. The victory set USC records for points scored in a single game and widest margin of victory. Gottlieb is a member of the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame of Northern California. Following WNBA legend Sue Bird’s retirement in 2022, some fans turned to Gottlieb as the new face of Jewish basketball. 'I wondered if there would be someone to assume [Bird’s] place as basketball’s Jewish role model,' Sophie Bravo wrote for JTA’s partner site Hey Alma in April. 'Lindsay seems to have stepped into the role seamlessly, balancing success, humility and determination, using her actions to guide and inspire.' Sam Salz blazes a trail for Orthodox Division I athletes Speaking of Jewish firsts, Texas A&M’s Sam Salz became likely the first-ever Orthodox Jew to appear in a Division I college football game when he took the field Nov. 16 with the Aggies. Salz’s debut marked the culmination of a years-long journey, one that took him from Kohelet Yeshiva High School — a Modern Orthodox school in Philadelphia with roughly 100 students and no football team — to a legendary college football program that peaked at No. 15 in the national rankings this season and plays in the vaunted Southeastern Conference. Salz, who had never played a snap of organized football in his life, let alone DI college ball, had walked onto the team in 2022 but had yet to appear in a game — in part because most college football games take place on Shabbat, when Salz doesn’t play. But on the school’s senior night, with 42 seconds left in the game, he heard his name called and ran out on the gridiron. 'There’s probably a Jewish kid, and maybe even especially an Orthodox kid, who wants to play football, or wants to play sports, and is sitting somewhere confused about what he should do, or who’s told that he’ll never be able to do it,' Salz said in an interview. 'Even getting to see me run down on that field, successful play or not, could have given him all the hope that he wanted.' Jake Retzlaff enjoys a breakout season — and celebrates with some matzah It sounds almost like the opening of a comedy routine: A proudly Jewish player at the flagship university of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints becomes a household name for college football fans. But it’s no joke. For Brigham Young University quarterback Jake Retzlaff, this was a breakout season. Retzlaff goes by 'BY-Jew' and made national headlines both for his on-field play and for how he publicly embraced his Jewish identity. Retzlaff, who grew up attending a Reform synagogue in Pomona, California, is BYU’s first Jewish starting quarterback and one of only three Jewish students at the Utah school. He threw 20 touchdowns this season as he led BYU to a 10-2 record in the Big-12 Conference and a top-25 national ranking — peaking at No. 9 on Nov. 5, a program record. And earlier this month, Retzlaff inked a sponsorship deal with Manischewitz, the Jewish food company’s first-ever sports deal. The package is set to include special-edition boxes of Manischewitz matzah emblazoned with Retzlaff’s likeness. Max Fried signs the largest contract in Jewish baseball history Retzlaff isn’t the only Jewish athlete with a landmark deal. Pitcher Max Fried entered the MLB offseason as one of the most coveted free agents on the market. And on Dec. 10, he got his payday. Fried signed an eight-year, $218 million contract with the New York Yankees, the largest contract ever for a Jewish player as well as for a left-handed pitcher (topping David Price’s 2015 deal by $1 million in raw terms). Fried, who turns 31 in January, has a 3.07 ERA in 151 career starts, all with the Atlanta Braves, and is a two-time All-Star, a three-time Gold Glove winner, a Silver Slugger winner and a 2021 World Series champion. In 2024, Fried posted an 11-10 record with a 3.25 ERA and 166 strikeouts in 174.1 innings. Now, the Los Angeles native, who grew up worshipping Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, will likely spend the rest of his career playing in the city with the most Jews in the world. Fried joins fellow Jewish pitcher Scott Effross, who was traded to the Yankees in 2022 but missed all of 2023 and most of 2024 with multiple injuries. Jewish Yankees pitching prospect Eric Reyzelman is working his way through the minor leagues. Brad Ausmus, the team’s bench coach, is also Jewish. Aerin Frankel and Quinn Hughes headline a banner year for Jewish hockey On the same day Fried signed his massive deal with the Yankees, the Vancouver Canucks became the first team in NHL history to feature three Jewish players in the same game. Defensemen Quinn Hughes and Mark Friedman and forward Max Sasson all played for the Canucks as they lost to the St. Louis Blues 4-3 in overtime. The Jewish hat trick capped a banner year for Jews in hockey. Jews featured prominently in the inaugural season of the Professional Women’s Hockey League, which dropped the puck on New Year’s Day, led by Boston Fleet goalie Aerin Frankel, who is arguably the best Jewish player in the league. Frankel posted a .929 save percentage in 18 games last season, but her breakout came in the playoffs, when the Northeastern alum saved over 95% of shots and earned the moniker 'Green Monster' — an homage to another formidable Boston sports presence — for her clutch performances. Boston lost to Minnesota in the finals in May despite Frankel’s brick wall. In the NHL, Edmonton Oilers star Zach Hyman put on a career performance last season, tallying 54 goals, the third-most in the NHL, plus 16 more in the playoffs. And Hughes finished with 75 assists, the third-most in the league, and won the James Norris Memorial Trophy, which is awarded to the NHL’s best defender. During the offseason this summer, Ryan Warsofsky became the first Jewish NHL head coach in three decades, University of Denver star Zeev Buium was selected 12th overall in the NHL Entry Draft and Jack, Luke and Quinn Hughes became the first brothers to grace the cover of the flagship NHL video game. Israeli Yaniv Bazini leads UVM to its first-ever NCAA soccer championship Before this month, the University of Vermont had won six national championships in the school’s history — all in skiing. On Dec. 16, the Catamounts captured the NCAA Division I soccer championship, thanks in large part to Israeli star Yaniv Bazini. Bazini, a senior from Ness Ziona in central Israel, joined UVM in 2022 and became an anchor of Vermont’s offense. This season, Bazini led the team with 14 goals — including six scored in postseason games — which is the second-most in a single season in program history. His 30 points were third-best in the UVM record books. Beyond his offensive prowess, Bazini was also known for his proud embrace of his Israeli and Jewish identity. Last October, Bazini draped himself in an Israeli flag after scoring his first goal following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. He brought the flag back out to celebrate the national title. Bazini told JTA he cherishes the opportunity to represent Jews on the pitch — which he hopes to do professionally, either in the MLS or abroad. 'It means everything,' he said. 'I got so many messages in the past couple days of kids that are impacted, and not only my soccer, but how I show that I’m Jewish and not afraid of it. By doing ‘Shema Yisrael’ at every beginning of the game or halftime, or every time I score, every time to thank God.' Honorable mentions Here are a few other Jewish sports stories from the past year that are worth noting: Assaf Lowengart made history as the first Israeli-born position player to sign a professional baseball contract in the U.S. when he joined the Frontier League’s New York Boulders in February. Hapoel Jerusalem honored slain hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, whom they called 'our friend in the stands.' Orthodox MLB prospect Jacob Steinmetz continued his ascent through the minor leagues, joining the Hillsboro Hops, the Arizona Diamondbacks’ High-A affiliate. MLB veteran Kevin Pillar enjoyed a late-career resurgence with the Los Angeles Angels — and embraced his role as a Jewish ballplayer. Team Israel launched an American organization to strengthen its national team pipeline and support baseball’s growth in Israel. Náutico Hacoaj became the first Jewish soccer club to compete in Argentina’s Amateur Promotional Tournament since 1967. Israeli fencer Yuval Freilich won a gold medal at the 2024 Qatar Grand Prix on Jan. 31, while wearing a uniform with an Israeli flag and the message 'Am Israel Chai,' Hebrew for 'the people of Israel lives,' written on his shoulder. Qatar, which does not have diplomatic ties with Israel, has played home to Hamas’ leadership. And last but not least, Jewish wrestling promoter Paul Heyman and boxing publicist Fred Sternburg were each inducted into their sport’s respective halls of fame. And the Jewish world mourned the deaths of Ken Holtzman, the winningest Jewish pitcher in MLB history, and Hall-of-Fame jockey Walter Blum, who rode to victory in the Belmont Stakes.

United Nations ‘condemns’ Israel for responding to Houthi attacks...	Officials associated with the Houthis claim that it will continue to attack Israel until the so-called 'genocide' in Gaza ceases. By The Algemeiner In its latest salvo against the Jewish state, the United Nations (UN) condemned Israel for executing retaliatory strikes against the Houthi terror group in Yemen. 'The Secretary-General condemns escalation between Yemen and Israel,' Stéphanie Tremblay, a UN spokesperson, said in Thursday statements on behalf of UN Secretary General António Guterres. 'The Secretary-General is gravely concerned about intensified escalation in Yemen and Israel. Israeli airstrikes today on Sana’a International Airport, the Red Sea ports and power stations in Yemen are especially alarming. The airstrikes reportedly resulted in numerous casualties including at least three killed and dozens more injured' Tremblay added. On Thursday, Israel launched a barrage of missile attacks on Houthi bases in Yemen, provoking international outrage. Israel targeted a major airport in Sanaa and ports in Hodeida, Al-Salif and Ras Qantib, and power stations, locations the Jewish state claims were used by the terror group to sneak in both Iranian weapons and high-ranking Iranian officials. On Friday, the Houthis claimed responsibility for an airstrike aimed at Ben Gurion Airport, claiming that the attacks were carried out in retaliation against Israel’s targeting of Sana’a International airport. The Israeli strikes followed days of Houthi missile and drone launches towards the Jewish state’s airspace. The Houthis have repeatedly attacked the Jewish state in the year following the Oct. 7 slaughters in Israel. Officials associated with the terrorist organization claim that it will continue to attack Israel until the so-called 'genocide' in Gaza ceases. In reference to the strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 'The Houthis, too, will learn what Hamas and Hezbollah and Assad’s regime and others learned.' Israeli officials have long accused the UN of having a bias against the Jewish state. Last year, the UN General Assembly condemned Israel twice as often as it did all other countries. Meanwhile, of all the country-specific resolutions passed by the UNHRC, nearly half have condemned Israel, a seemingly disproportionate focus on the lone democracy in the Middle East. Weeks following the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel, the UN adopted a resolution calling for a 'ceasefire' between Israel and the terrorist group. The UN failed to pass a measure condemning the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7. In June, the UN put Israel on its so-called 'list of shame' of countries that kill children in armed conflict. Israel is considered to be the only democracy on the list.

Soldier KIA in Gaza, bringing IDF wartime toll to 823	The death toll among Israeli troops on all fronts since the Hamas-led massacre on Oct. 7, 2023, stands at 823. By JNS An Israel Defense Forces soldier was killed on Friday while battling Palestinian terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip, the military announced. The slain man was named as Maj. Hod Shriebman, 27, of the elite Multidomain Unit, from Moshav Tzofit, near Kfar Saba. On Wednesday, an IDF reservist was killed in combat in the central Gaza Strip. He was identified as Capt. (res.) Amit Levi, 35, from Shomria, a religious kibbutz in the northern Negev. Two days earlier, three Israeli soldiers were killed in action fighting Hamas terrorists in northern Gaza. The soldiers were named as Capt. Ilay Gavriel Atedgi, 22, from Kiryat Motzkin; Staff Sgt. Netanel Pessach, 21, from Elazar; and Sgt. 1st Class (res.) Hillel Diener, 21, from Talmon. All three men served in the Kfir Brigade’s 92nd 'Shimshon' Infantry Battalion. The death toll among Israeli troops since the start of the Gaza ground incursion on Oct. 27, 2023, stands at 391, and at 823 on all fronts since the Hamas-led massacre on Oct. 7, 2023. Additionally, Ch. Insp. Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage-rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Israeli FM calls new Syrian government a ‘gang of terrorists’	Sa'ar described the new Syrian government as 'an Islamist regime aiming to establish unified control over all of Syria.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Despite some conciliatory remarks about Israel made by the new Syrian government, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said the new regime is comprised of 'a gang of terrorists.' 'Globally, people talk about 'organized regime change in Syria,' but it's not as if a new government was democratically elected to rule all of Syria,' he said. 'Instead, it's a group of terrorists who initially controlled Idlib, and then took over Damascus and other regions,' Sa'ar said. Sa'ar's statements are in contrast to statements by new leaders in Syria that they do not seek conflict with Israel He continued,'The world is eager to view them as a new and stable regime because many countries want to send the evacuees they are hosting back to Syria.' However, Sa'ar added,'That's not the reality. There are ongoing battles with the Alawites along the coastline, explicit threats from [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan to dismantle Kurdish autonomy, and harassment of Syria's Christian community.' He also emphasized that Syria's new government 'is an Islamist regime aiming to establish unified control over all of Syria.' Maher Marwan, appointed as the new governor of Damascus, has declared that he seeks peace with Israel, ynet reports. Marwan, who was appointed by Syria’s de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), said in an interview in the US he intended no harm to Israel. 'There exists a people who want coexistence. They want peace. They don’t want disputes. We want peace, and we cannot be an opponent to Israel or an opponent to anyone,' he said in an interview with U.S. public radio network NPR. At the same time, he acknowledged that, given the tense history between Israel and Syria, Israelis may be a bit hesitant to fully accept this. 'It’s natural for Israel to be worried about certain factions.' He added, ' Israel may have felt fear, so it advanced a little, bombed a little, etc. We have no fear towards Israel, and our problem is not with Israel. And we don’t want to meddle in anything that will threaten Israel’s security or any other country’s security.'

IDF downs Houthi missile from Yemen, as sirens blare in Jerusalem	It was the first time air-raid sirens sounded in Jerusalem since the Iranian attack on Oct. 1. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces overnight Friday intercepted a missile fired by Houthi terrorists in Yemen that triggered air-raid sirens across the Jerusalem, Judea and Dead Sea areas. The missile was downed outside of Israeli airspace, according to the military, and there were no immediate reports of injuries. Sirens sounded in dozens of Israeli communities. It was the first time air-raid sirens sounded in Jerusalem since the Iranian attack on Oct. 1.

A U.S.-made THAAD anti-missile battery assisted in the interception, in the first such instance since the system was deployed to Israel in October. On Thursday, the Israeli Air Force conducted strikes on the western coast of and deep inside Yemen, including at Sanaa International Airport in the Houthi-controlled capital. The targets included the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations, in addition to terror infrastructure in the Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports. 'These military targets were used by the Houthi terrorist regime to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials. This is a further example of the Houthis’ exploitation of civilian infrastructure for military purposes,' the IDF said. 'The Houthi terrorist regime is a central part of the Iranian axis of terror, and their attacks on international shipping vessels and routes continue to destabilize the region and the wider world. … The IDF will not hesitate to operate at any distance against any threat to the State of Israel and its citizens,' added the statement. Speaking from IAF headquarters after the strike on the second night of Chanukah, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is engaged in a modern-day Maccabean struggle. 'We are determined to cut off this terrorist arm of Iran’s axis of evil,' the prime minister said. 'We will persist in this until we complete the task.' Sitting beside Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz said that anyone responsible for attacking Israel is a potential target. 'We will hunt down all the Houthi leaders—we will strike them as we have done in other places,' Katz said. 'No one will be able to evade Israel’s long reach.'

Houthi terrorists have launched over 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The terrorist group has escalated its attacks in the past 10 days, scoring hits on Israel’s densely populated central region. Overnight Monday, a woman in her 60s was critically injured when she struck her head while rushing to a shelter in Tel Aviv during sirens triggered by another Houthi missile. Before dawn on Dec. 19, the warhead from an intercepted missile hit an elementary school in Ramat Gan, collapsing the school’s main building but causing no injuries. The following night, a missile hit a playground in a residential area of Jaffa, lightly wounding 16 people. The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency session on Monday to discuss the escalating Houthi attacks, at Israel’s request.

Dutch king asks Jews to ‘stay,’ tells Muslims: ‘It’s your country...	To Jewish Dutch people who tell me they doubt their future here, I say: Stay! We belong together,' said the king. By Canaan Lindor, JNS King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands juxtaposed in a Christmas address Wednesday the malaise of Dutch Jews and Palestinians, urging the former not to emigrate and reminding the latter that 'this is your country, too.' The unusual appeal, which many praised and many others said was misguided and inappropriate, came in the wake of a wave of antisemitic assaults in Amsterdam on Nov. 7-8 by Muslim men against Israeli soccer fans. The assaults, which many Dutch Jews have called a pogrom, prompted a heated national debate about antisemitism, Muslim radicalism and allegations that Israel is perpetrating genocide in Gaza. Earlier this week, five of the perpetrators were given what were widely seen as lenient sentences. Jewish students in Amsterdam told the Dutch monarch about 'how they prefer to keep quiet on the street and in the tram,' he said. Whereas Palestinians in Vlaardingen spoke 'about their fear for the fate of family members in their country of origin' and 'about their helplessness and despair,' he added. 'To Jewish Dutch people who tell me they doubt their future here, I say: Stay! We belong together. 'To Dutch Muslims, I say: This is your country too; this is your country too,' added the king. He did not name the assaults against the Maccabi Tel Aviv fans but may have referenced them when he said: 'We do not resort to violence, even when we feel hurt or misunderstood.' Juliaan van Acker, an emeritus professor from Radboud University in Nijmegen and an expert in rehabilitating juvenile delinquents, slammed the address on X, calling it a promotional speech for 'looking the other way.' With many millions of Muslims in Europe, 'heavily guarded synagogues and Jewish schools, a Jew with foresight would do better to emigrate to Israel as soon as possible,' wrote van Acker, who is not Jewish. He wondered whether radical Muslims 'really belong' in the Netherlands. Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-Islam and pro-Israel Party for Freedom, tweeted immediately after the address: 'The Netherlands is ours, proud of our culture, our customs, our traditions, it is our country.' ‘Not safe for Jews’ Jan Dijkgraaf, a prominent Dutch journalist, wrote in a column about the king’s speech that the only important part of it was the juxtaposition between Jews and Muslims. 'Without directly mentioning it, you make it clear in two paragraphs what Jews have known for a long time, but what non-Jews who have taken off their blinders discovered since the Hamas pogrom on October 7, 2023: That the Netherlands is not a safe country for Jews. Not then. Not now. Never,' Dijkgraaf wrote. The address also received praise, including from Dutch Jews who found it 'beautiful and unifying,' as Itai Cohn, a Jewish resident of The Hague who promotes dialogue between Jews and Muslims, wrote on X. Much of the criticism about the speech on social media in the Netherlands was about the absence of a Christmas tree, which previous monarchs tended to have in the background of their filmed holiday addresses, but which Willem-Alexander dispensed with soon after becoming king in 2013. On Tuesday, a court in Amsterdam handed sentences that ranged from 100 hours of community service to six months in jail to five perpetrators of the Nov. 7-8 assaults. The sentences, four of which fell considerably short of what the prosecution had sought, were widely seen by Dutch Jews as lenient in light of the magnitude and violence of the events. 'As someone who witnessed these trials firsthand, I am deeply disheartened by the leniency of these sentences' said Ziporah Reich, director of litigation at The Lawfare Project, which provides pro bono legal services to protect the civil and human rights of the Jewish people worldwide.

How the international community funds the Hamas war machine	Hamas exploits its power to plunder the international resources delivered into Gaza, which it uses to sustain its dictatorship. By Natan Galula, JNS On Nov. 29, 2024, three Palestinians, a woman and two children, were crushed to death while waiting in line outside a bakery in central Gaza. The images of thousands of Palestinians huddled against each other, pressing inwards for a bag of pita bread, with young girls on camera desperately gasping for air, made headline news all over the world. Humanitarian organizations said that people in Gaza were on the 'brink of famine.' Ajith Sunghay, the head of the U.N. Human Rights Office in the Palestinian territories, said, 'The breakdown of public order and safety is exacerbating the situation with rampant looting and fighting over scarce resources.' He added that 'prices of the meager commodities that are available have skyrocketed.' The agency running the United Nations’ World Food Programme warned in early December that the 'humanitarian response in Gaza is nearing collapse. For over 50 days almost no food has reached North Gaza.' Similar warnings were proclaimed in the past. In March, the Food Security Analysis Unit, which works under the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization, released a report that stated, 'Famine is now projected and imminent in the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates and is expected to become manifest during the projection period from mid-March 2024 to May 2024.' But the projected famine never came to pass. According to Eyal Ofer—a former government adviser, frequent guest commentator on Israeli media outlets and an expert on 'Hamas economics'—shortages of food in Gaza are not due to a lack of foreign aid. Ever since the November 2023 hostage agreement between Jerusalem and Hamas, Israel has opened at least five crossings into the Gaza Strip, enabling the entry of thousands of aid trucks per month into the Palestinian enclave, Ofer told JNS over the phone on Thursday. The bakery scenes 'were completely orchestrated by Hamas,' he said. 'Every bakery in the Gaza Strip produces tens of thousands of bags of pita bread per day, and yet the bakery distributes only 300 bags per hour.' The rest, he said, is 'smuggled' to Hamas-controlled markets. Instead of selling a bag of pita bread for three shekels ($0.82)—the typical price at the bakeries—it sells for 50 or 60 shekels (~$16) due to artificially induced scarcity. 'Hamas intentionally created a situation of scarcity,' Ofer stressed. 'The wheat is sent into Gaza for free in the form of international aid. Even the cooking gas used by the bakeries, I believe, is supplied by the World Food Programme. This is how the typical bag of pita bread sells in the Gaza Strip for [the cheap price of] three shekels [82 cents], even before the war.' When the war broke out, he explained, 'Hamas took over the bags of wheat and hoarded them in its own warehouses or in UNRWA warehouses, which are de facto run by Hamas.' If a 55-pound bag cost $14 before the war, during the war prices rose typically to $70 or $80, in rare cases even reaching $400, he said. Today, Ofer added, they sell for about $30, depending on the location within Gaza. Extorting the bakeries After Israel took measures to stop Hamas from getting the wheat, the terrorist group readjusted its method of operation and took over the bakeries, said Ofer. There are a dozen large industrial bakeries that operate throughout the Strip—four in the north and eight in the center and south—with several smaller 'tabuns' (outdoor stoves for baking) used in poorer communities, he explained. 'A bakery that produces 30,000 bags a day that are ready in the morning has no problem distributing them to 30,000 people [throughout the day],' he noted. However, because Hamas is so embedded in the population and controls it by force, the terrorist organization can compel the bakeries to sell only a small portion of their production at the regular price and smuggle the rest to the markets. 'You have to think about this in purely economic terms. The monopolies [in the markets] hoard the supply, even let some of the food rot, so they can create artificially high demand and thus cut higher profits than if they sold everything for lower prices,' he told JNS. 'This is how you got photos on CNN of large groups of people pushing each other all the way to the small hatch in the bakery’s front or back doors for one bag of pita bread for three shekels.' Ofer emphasized that those who argue Hamas is able to ensure its rule thanks to the humanitarian aid are wrong. Hamas already rules Gaza, he noted, which is why it controls pricing there. 'You will not find anywhere Hamas members who are distributing food to civilians. Hamas establishes its rule not by controlling the food, but by the fact that it is the most powerful organization in Gaza, that controls all of the economic activity under its rule. People are reversing cause and effect,' he said. Plundering aid The bakery incident is a prime example of the 'circular nature' of Hamas’s rule, said Ofer: It exploits its power to plunder the international resources delivered into Gaza, which it uses to sustain its dictatorship. 'In 2017, the World Bank formulated a report that stated that the only way to help Gaza’s civilians is to topple Hamas, which takes most of the money transferred into Gaza,' said Haim Ramon, a long-time Knesset member (1983-2009) and former vice prime minister, speaking to JNS on Friday. 'I always said that I am not responsible for the Palestinians, but the only way to increase their welfare is to topple Hamas,' said Ramon. 'According to the Shin Bet [Israel Security Agency], about one third of all dollars that enter the Gaza Strip, be it in the form of money or goods, goes to Hamas,' he added. Ramon was one of the chief advocates of Israel’s 2005 unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, which involved the evacuation of some 8,000 Jewish residents and a full withdrawal of the military. He noted that the Jewish state has indeed mostly disengaged from the Gaza Strip, but is still its main supplier of electricity, and handles the entry of foreign aid. 'But this is largely unimportant. If [Gaza] did not have a terrorist government and would cooperate with us to improve the lives of its citizens, we could have turned Gaza into, if not exactly Singapore, a much more humane place,' he said. UNRWA and Hamas Einat Wilf, a former Israeli parliamentarian from the Independence and Labor parties, political scientist and the author of several books on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, spoke to JNS on Friday about the role in Gaza of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. In no other conflict or place in the world, she said, 'can you find a situation where an external body assumes the responsibility to finance all the daily needs of the [local people] in a way that absolves them of any responsibility for themselves.' While UNRWA takes care of the welfare of Palestinians, Hamas can keep arming itself and bolster its military capabilities, concentrating all of its efforts on the next massacre of Jews, she added. 'They face no [economic] consequences if in every round of fighting they can go back to square one,' she stressed, referring to the funds that keep flowing into Gaza regardless of whether Hamas decides to resort to violence or pursue peace. UNRWA is a U.N. agency formed in 1949 in the aftermath of Israel’s War of Independence. Unlike any other group of displaced persons supported by the United Nations, all the descendants of Palestinians displaced as a result of the war are registered by UNRWA as refugees. As stated on its website, UNRWA’s purpose is to 'carry out direct relief and works programs for Palestine refugees.' Its mandate is 'to respond to the needs of more than 5.6 million' Palestinians in 'areas of education, health, protection, relief and social services, microfinance and camp improvement.' The agency’s funding amounted to total pledges of $1.46 billion in 2023, with the United States, Germany, the European Union and France as its top contributors. Its headquarters are located in Gaza and Amman, Jordan. Two weeks after Hamas launched the deadliest single-day attack in Israel’s history on Oct. 7, 2023, senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk was asked why his organization had not built bomb shelters for civilians if it could construct 300 miles of underground tunnels for its fighters. Marzouk replied that the tunnels were built to protect Hamas fighters, while protecting the 75% of Gaza residents who are listed as refugees is 'the responsibility of the United Nations.' What he was saying, Wilf elaborated, 'was that ‘we’ [Hamas] concentrate on massacring Jews while ‘you’ [the world] fund the things that should have been under our care, had we been expected to take care of them.' The former Knesset member pointed to a poster found in a refugee camp near Bethlehem that read: 'UNRWA services are our right until the Return.' The so-called Palestinian 'right of return' calls for the resettling of millions of descendants of Arabs who lived in the British Mandate of Palestine before 1948 in current-day Israel. 'You could not sum up the Palestinian relation to UNRWA better than this one sentence,' Wilf stated. 'Essentially it means that the British, German or Australian taxpayer will fund the livelihood of Palestinians until the day the Jewish state ceases to exist.' Fueling the warmongers 'Gaza has no economic problem,' Wilf continued. 'It sits on beautiful, white sand beaches … and is situated on attractive trading routes. Its land is also effective for agriculture. The problem [in Gaza] is political. Politics have turned Gaza into a war machine. Gaza doesn’t really need outside help. Its people need to decide if they prefer investing in themselves, rather than destroying what the Jews have built.' She went on to say that the world needs to stop financing the Palestinians. If UNRWA ceases to exist, Wilf stressed, nothing significant will change on the ground. UNRWA workers are Palestinian, 'not European employees as most people imagine,' she said, noting that Gaza will have the same workers with the same set of skills; the only thing that will change is that they will have to start paying their own bills. 'This may be a radical idea,' Wilf continued sarcastically, 'but if they run their own economy, collect taxes like any other country, pay their own salaries [and deal with real-life challenges], they will not have the time to build hundreds of kilometers of tunnels and plot Oct. 7s.' Foreign supplies that regularly enter Gaza serve as the basis of its current economy, from which Hamas collects its salaries and continues its terrorist activities, she said. 'The one thing that Israel should not have compromised on [in the Iron Swords war] was the issue of foreign aid,' she added. 'Even if America threatened to withhold weapons from us, we should have remained resolute. As far as I’m concerned, we didn’t have to strike one house in Gaza, but declare instead: nothing goes in, until the hostages come out.' The former lawmaker noted that the world’s message to the Gazans after the war concludes will have profound consequences. If Palestinians understand that the 'destruction in Gaza is what happens when you insist on holding onto your stupid ideology of destroying Israel,' she noted, then things can change for the better. But if the message is that 'the destruction is horrible, Jews are bad, let’s hurry up and reconstruct everything,' then things will continue as they were. 'The war is the result of [Gaza’s outside funding]. The message is: You concentrate on ‘from the river to the sea’ and we will take care of everything else.' The mafia in Gaza Eyal Ofer has been following the funding methods of Hamas and other terrorist organizations for years, collecting data and writing about his findings. He told JNS that Hamas’s financial conduct has not changed in a significant way over the years. If before the war it extorted 25% from luxury car dealers, today in the midst of war it extorts money from wheat merchants. 'Hamas is present everywhere in the Gaza Strip: the police, humanitarian associations, actors in the private and public sectors, the contractors’ union—Hamas is networked within and across Gaza. You can’t just vacuum Hamas out, it is everywhere,' he said. In a tweet that went viral on Sunday, he wrote that 'Hamas operates like a mafia and a clan-based enterprise: one brother is in the military wing, another in the police force, they ensure the sister works for UNRWA, a noncombat-profile cousin becomes a driver for an aid organization, an uncle gets a government position, another cousin is a ‘journalist’ for Al Jazeera, and the grandmother is added to the list of welfare recipients.' The claim that Iran provides 70% of Hamas’s funding is 'nonsense,' he wrote. 'In extreme cases, Iran provides 5-10% of Hamas’s funding. The vast majority of Hamas’s funding comes from its ability to funnel money that the world sends to the Palestinian Authority (and other Gaza charitable causes) and Gaza for its own purposes.' As an example, he attached a document from the P.A.’s Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF), a semi-governmental urban development fund, highlighting the receipt of some $3 million from the government of Belgium in 2023 for a project named, 'Promotion of Green Services and Climate Action in Local Governance—Green Gaza.' 'What are the chances that Hamas’s regime in Gaza will manage to place its members or their relatives among the beneficiaries of this Belgian grant? In my opinion: 100%. … Multiply this story by 200, and you’ll see how Hamas is funded,' Ofer said. The money-laundering scheme Ofer further explained that Hamas’s chief financial problem is not raising money inside Gaza, but transferring its accumulated cash out of the region. The primary currency in the Gaza Strip is the Israeli shekel. During the war, Hamas acquired a monopoly on cash in Gaza, with local banks largely unserviceable. Ofer told JNS that it is impossible to assess how much cash Hamas currently holds. 'Hundreds of millions, maybe even one to two billion shekels. It extracts money from the population by force, which is how it continues to pay salaries to its operatives [and recruit new fighters], but also how it established itself as the monopoly on the supply of money,' he said. 'Many Gazans today receive direct donations from abroad, transferred via Western Union, the banks, cryptocurrencies like USD Coin, Vodafone Cash Wallet [a mobile app], GoFundMe, monthly stipends from the P.A., U.N. humanitarian agencies such as UNICEF. All these transfers are deposited in bank accounts, and their holders need to convert them into cash—whether the deposit is in dollars or shekels. Who do they go to for cash? Hamas.' The Islamist organization developed an entire industry of non-banking ATMs, Ofer explained. The Gazans transfer to Hamas their dollars or shekels and Hamas provides them with cash, though with 'unbelievably' high fees, he said. 'The fees started at 15% and have reached more than 30% in areas with greater scarcity,' he added. 'This is how Hamas manages to launder money to unknown accounts.' Ofer could not say with certainty that all money changers in Gaza are Hamas operatives, but noted that it is hard to imagine a regular person moving about in the Gaza Strip with hundreds of thousands of shekels in cash without fear. The broken Gaza fallacy In 1850, French economist Frédéric Bastiat published an essay titled 'That Which Is Seen, and That Which Is Not Seen.' In it, he described what became known in the field of economics as the 'broken window fallacy.' The conceptual framework notes that while it is seen that a child breaking a shopkeeper’s window, for example, will provide the glazier with work to repair the window, what is not seen is the aggregate growth of the economy through alternative work had the window not been broken (such as the shopkeeper purchasing a new pair of shoes). The Palestinian case may demonstrate a similar fallacy. That which is seen is the reconstruction of Gaza after every war, believing that this helps the Palestinians. That which is unseen is letting the Palestinians deal with the consequences of war alone, having to choose whether to abandon their ideological battle against Israel or continue on their path to destruction. 'The Palestinians know that after every round of fighting, the round of reconstruction begins,' Ofer said, adding that this causes perverse economic incentives. 'If the Qataris come in and propose rebuilding a city that was destroyed in the previous war and was now destroyed again, a private contractor has two jobs, not one. The Hamas government cuts its share from the contractor, the residents who received contributions and everyone else in the chain of rehabilitation,' he noted. According to Ofer, many of the regular economic metrics that economists use, such as GDP, are irrelevant in the case of Gaza, because a huge section of its economy is nonproductive. 'There is no question that Gaza, in great percentages, is a charity-based economy. A private sector emerges out of these donations, but the nucleus of the economy, maybe 40% to 50%, is based on external donations that fund Gaza’s welfare [programs] and the public sector,' he told JNS. Ofer added that Israel lacks 'political wisdom. Instead of disengaging from Gaza, we keep opening more and more crossings into the Strip in the hope that the world will see us as enlightened rulers. At the start of the war, all aid came through the Rafah Crossing border with Egypt. Israel should have stated: That’s it Gaza, from now on, you work with Egypt. You are not our problem anymore.'

Menorah from remains of drone that hit Jewish school lights up Ki...	This is a menorah that tells the story of the victory of light over darkness in our time,' said the Chief Rabbi of Kyiv and Chabad emissary, Rabbi Yonatan Markovich. By Jewish Breaking News About 500 members of the Jewish community in Kiev gathered last night to light the first candle of Hanukkah together with the head of the Ukrainian Military Intelligence and special advisor to President Zelensky, Kyrylo Budanov. The menorah, designed by a local artist, incorporates metal parts from the drone that attacked the school. Its base is decorated with interlocking human figures symbolizing unity, and the candles are placed in defused shell casings of the Ukrainian army. Last October, just hours before the start of the school day, a Russian drone struck the Jewish school. The impact caused significant damage to the building, but miraculously there were no injuries among the school’s students and staff. Following the incident, the community expanded its humanitarian activities and added psychological support to its members. 'This is a menorah that tells the story of the victory of light over darkness in our time,' said the Chief Rabbi of Kyiv and Chabad emissary, Rabbi Yonatan Markovich. 'From those fragments of destruction, we created a source of light that will illuminate our schoolyard. This menorah is living proof that the light of Jewish education in Kiev will not go out, and that out of the darkness a greater light will always shine.'

Israel reveals links between killed Gaza ‘journalists’ and Islami...	Gaza journalists being on the payroll of or collaborating with Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been a repeated controversy. By Pesach Benson, TPS Rebutting Palestinian claims that five journalists were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces released information on Thursday showing that the five were members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad. 'Intelligence from multiple sources confirmed that these individuals were Islamic Jihad operatives posing as journalists,' the IDF said. 'One source was a list of Islamic Jihad operatives discovered by the IDF during operations in the Gaza Strip. This list explicitly identified four of the eliminated individuals as members of the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization.' The five people killed in Thursday morning’s airstrike in the central Gaza town of Nuseirat were identified as Ibrahim Jamal Ibrahim Al-Sheikh Ali, Islamic Jihad operations and combat propaganda operative; Faisal Abdallah Muhammad Abu Qamsan, Head of Security for the Islamic Jihad in Nuseirat; Mohammed Ayad Khamis al-Lada’a, Islamic Jihad combat propagandist; Ayman Nihad Abd Alrahman Jadi, Islamic Jihad combat propagandist and former Islamic Jihad naval operative; and Fadi Ihab Muhammad Ramadan Hassouna, Islamic Jihad combat propagandist in Nuseirat. Islamic Jihad’s TV channel, Al Quds Today, said the five worked for it. Gaza journalists being on the payroll of or collaborating with Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been a repeated controversy. Hamas documents seized in Gaza and released by the Israel in October showed how Al Jazeera received directions for covering specific incidents and even the establishment of a special hotline. Jeremy Loffredo, a US journalist with ties to an Iranian-funded website, was deported in October over a video he posted detailing where Iranian missiles landed in Israel Files found by soldiers in Gaza revealed that Al Jazeera reporter Ismail al-Ghoul was an engineer in Hamas’s Gaza City Brigade who also participated in the October 7 attacks as a member of the Nukhba force. Israel shut down Al-Jazeera’s operations in September, revoking the network’s press credentials, confiscating transmitters and blocking its websites. The move to proscribe the Qatari network gained momentum in February after reporter Mohamed Washah was exposed as a Hamas commander when soldiers recovered his laptop in northern Gaza. The shutdown is not permanent but is subject to renewal every 45 days. The Knesset is currently advancing legislation that would extend the ban to renewable 90-day intervals. In June, sources in Gaza confirmed to The Press Service of Israel that Israeli hostages Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv were rescued from the home of Palestinian journalist Abdallah Aljama in the Nuseirat refugee camp. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Gwyneth Paltrow talks Hanukkah family traditions, Jewish heritage...	In 2011, Paltrow discovered that she comes from a long line of rabbis on her father’s side of the family and that her great-great-great grandfather was Rabbi Tsvi Paltrowitch, a Kabbalah master and the Gaon of Nitzy-Novgorod in southwest Russia. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Jewish American Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow joined author and activist Noa Tishby in celebrating the first night of Hanukkah on Wednesday, as part of the latter’s new Hanukkah-themed video series on YouTube called '#BringOnTheLight.' Paltrow — whose late father Bruce Paltrow was Jewish while her mother, actress Blythe Danner, is Christian — also talked with Tishby about her Jewish faith and holiday tradition. When Tishby asked the 'Iron Man' star and Goop founder and CEO about a childhood memory from Hanukkah that she holds dear, Paltrow recalled being at her grandparents’ house in Long Island, New York, and getting Hanukkah gelt. 'I have such a strong memory of the gold, round coins, and my brother and I just tearing into them,' she reminisced, talking about the coin-shaped chocolates that are typically given to children during Hanukkah. The 'Contagion' star also told Tishby that in her home now, she makes latkes for Hanukkah and lights the menorah with her family. 'We always light the menorah, we always gather together after we light the candles; it’s very sweet actually. We all hug and we bring in the light,' she said. 'And ever since [my kids] were little, they would sit on the floor, close their eyes, and then I would give them their present. We do eight presents. I’m a spoiler.' Paltrow has two children — Apple, 20, and Moses, 18 – with her ex-husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. She is now married to American television writer, producer, and director Brad Falchuk, both of whose parents are Jewish. His mother was previously the national president of the Hadassah Women’s Zionist Organization of America. In 2011, Paltrow discovered that she comes from a long line of rabbis on her father’s side of the family and that her great-great-great grandfather was Rabbi Tsvi Paltrowitch, a Kabbalah master and the Gaon of Nitzy-Novgorod in southwest Russia. She told Tishby she comes from 17 generations of rabbis. Paltrow also discussed what it was like growing up with a Jewish father and Christian mother. 'I grew up in a time in the 70’s where I think interfaith marriage was a big deal, so it was really hard for both of my parents’ parents that they were marrying each other. So it was a bit scandalous. Nobody was happy about it,' she said. 'They definitely grew to accept it later in life,' the actress added, talking about her grandparents. 'They kind of let go of all that. But I felt so fortunate because I got to grow up with these two very different worlds and very different faiths. I always felt an incredible pull to my Jewish family and I still do. And the traditions, and the warmth, the unconditional love, the food, the yelling, the family … I’m so close to everybody on that side of my family. We are all kind of interwoven and important to each other and just show up for each other again and again and again.' Tishby’s eight-part video series '#BringOnTheLight,' which coincides with the eight days of Hanukkah, launched on YouTube on Wednesday and promotes Jewish pride and unity. A new video will be released each day of Hanukkah at 11 am ET.

Elderly Herzliya woman murdered in terror stabbing	Security guards neutralized the terrorist at the scene by shooting him in the leg. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Friday morning, a woman in Herzliya aged around 80 was stabbed to death by a terrorist. The stabbing, which took place on Kdoshei Hashoah Street, was initially reported by Magen Dovid Adom as resulting in 'very serious' injuries. However, the woman succumbed to multiple stab wounds, and she was declared dead shortly after arriving at Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv. The hospital reported, 'She was brought to the hospital with multiple stab wounds and, despite efforts at resuscitation, the hospital was forced to declare her dead upon arrival.' Security guards neutralized the terrorist at the scene by shooting him in the leg. He was identified as an Arab man from Tulkarm who had previously spent time in Israeli prisons but who gave no prior warning of an attack. Tel Aviv District police commander Haim Sergoff told Arutz Sheva, 'Security guards from Brinks heard shouts of, 'Allahu akhbar,' identified the stabbings, fired shots, and hit the terrorist, who is a resident of the [Palestinian Authority-controlled] territories.'

Mossad chief recommends hitting Iran to stop Houthis, Netanyahu d...	Barnea raised the suggestion to attack Iran after three strikes against Yemen failed to stop the Houthis from firing missiles into Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Mossad chief David Barnea reportedly has suggested striking directly at Iran to deal with attacks from Houthis. Still, according to Haaretz, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz responded that they preferred to keep hitting the Houthis directly. Barnea raised the suggestion to attack Iran after three strikes against Yemen failed to stop the Houthis from firing missiles into Israel. The Mossad reportedly believes it is more effective to hit Iran directly since it funds the Yemenite terror group. Mossad chief David Barnea has been pushing Israel's leadership to concentrate on attacking Iran as a way to stem attacks from the Houthi rebels, according to reports Wednesday, as senior officials hinted that strikes against the Iran-backed Yemeni group were set to escalate in the near future. The stance reportedly adopted by Barnea stands in contrast to the opinion of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, who prefer to keep carrying out strikes against the Houthis themselves rather than against Iran. According to the Haaretz newspaper, Barnea raised the option during a series of discussions on the lack of results from three earlier rounds of strikes in Yemen. The report stated that the Mossad chief believes it would be more effective to go after Iran, which funds and arms the Shiite rebel group. 'We need to go head-on against Iran,' Barnea told security officials, according to Channel 13. 'If we only attack the Houthis, it's not certain that we'll be able to stop them.' There was no independent confirmation of whether these conversations took place, and the reports were based on statements from anonymous sources. According to Channel 13, Netanyahu responded to Barnea that Iran was 'a different issue, which will be dealt with at the appropriate time.'' Members of the security establishment reportedly shared Netanyahu's assessment. In the past ten days, the Houthis have fired five ballistic missiles and five drones at Israel, damaging property and causing injuries.

Netanyahu pushes back after Hamas blames him for breakdown in hos...	Netanyahu: 'The terrorist organization Hamas is once again lying, going back on agreements that have already been reached.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In response to Hamas blaming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the stalling of the hostage deal, the premier says the terror group is lying once again, i24 reports. Although Hamas leaked to the BBC last week that the hostage deal was '90%' completed, the two sides have reached yet another impasse as Hamas has once again refused to release a list of living hostages to be released in the first phase of the agreement. However, the terror group responsible for the October 7th massacre says it is the Prime Minister who is responsible for the breakdown in talks and alleges that he has made additional demands. Hamas claimed, 'The negotiation for a ceasefire and exchanging prisoners was carried out secretly, through Qatari and Egyptian mediation, in a serious manner.' They continued, 'Hamas showed responsibility and flexibility, but Israel imposed new demands related to a troop withdrawal from the [Gaza] Strip, the implementation of the ceasefire, the prisoner exchange and return of the refugees – this led to a delay in reaching an agreement, which was possible.' In response, the Prime Minister's office responded, 'The terrorist organization Hamas is once again lying, going back on agreements that have already been reached, and it continues to impose roadblocks in the negotiation process. Despite this, Israel will continue with unstinting efforts to bring back all of our captives.' On Tuesday, Israeli officials expressed frustration that Mohammed Sinwar, brother of slain October 7th mastermind Yahya Sinwar, had refused to submit a list of hostages to be released in phase one of the agreement. However, the Israeli delegation has remained in Qatar to proceed with negotiations, which nonetheless seem stalled.

Two record-breaking menorahs light path of hope	Now, from the White House lawn to the foot of the Eiffel Tower, some 15,000 public menorahs carry on a vision of bringing Hanukkah’s message of redemption and hope to every corner of the earth. By Jewish Breaking News The world’s two largest menorahs are illuminating Hanukkah celebrations on opposite sides of the globe this year. It took 100 volunteers and an all-night effort to pull it off, but Schneider Children’s Medical Center has done it again. Their massive menorah, crafted from 25,000 recyclable balloons, now towers above the Petah Tikva skyline for the tenth straight year. In a touching tribute to the hostages in Gaza, a yellow ribbon winds through the soaring menorah. Six thousand miles west, its New York rival climbs 36 feet above Fifth Avenue. A Guinness-certified landmark designed by Yaacov Agam, the bronze behemoth has been stopping traffic near Central Park for decades. Public officials and dignitaries frequently visit this historic New York menorah during Hanukkah, including notables such as New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Israeli Consul General Asaf Zamir. However, this year’s lighting is bittersweet as it’s the first without Chabad Rabbi Shmuel Butman, whose booming voice and boundless energy made him a Hanukkah fixture until his death in August. This year marks a half-century since the first public menorah was lit at Philadelphia’s Liberty Bell in 1974. Sparked by the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s appeal to bring Hanukkah celebrations into public spaces worldwide, that pioneering ceremony set off a movement that would eventually place menorahs in city centers and landmarks across the globe. Now, from the White House lawn to the foot of the Eiffel Tower, some 15,000 public menorahs carry on a vision of bringing Hanukkah’s message of redemption and hope to every corner of the earth. document.createElement('video'); The post Two record-breaking menorahs light path of hope appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/two-record-breaking-menorahs-light-path-of-hope/	2024-12-26T09:16:18-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GfuRmfAXIAAuYCv.jpeg

By Pesach Benson, TPS Microtech, a subsidiary of Tel Aviv-based Medinol Inc., announced on Thursday the launch of human clinical trials for its microsensor platform aimed at improving heart failure treatment. The first successful implantation of the device was recently performed by Prof. Erez Sharoni at Beilinson Medical Center in Petah-Tikva. Utilizing external ultrasound communication, the microsensor enables current implants to function as smart devices, capable of gathering real-time data and performing multiple functions simultaneously. 'This amazing technology may change the standard of care for patients suffering from heart failure and in particular, in this current study, those who are receiving LVADs or heart transplants,' said Sharoni. The data collected by the microsensors will be used to assist heart failure specialists in making clinical decisions. 'Heart failure is characterized by periods of quiescence, followed by periods of deterioration, which require repeat hospitalizations. This ground-breaking technology will allow us to track patients’ parameters in real time, to intervene earlier if needed and to reduce these patients’ morbidity and mortality' explained Dr. Tuvia Ben-Gal, Head of Heart Failure at Rabin Medical Center. Medinol CEO Dr. Yoram Richter, CEO of Medinol said the technology could be applied clinical scenarios such as heart failure, glaucoma, hydrocephalous, portal hypertension, and more. 'Incorporating sensors into existing medical devices gives physicians the ability to treat patients based on quantifiable physiological parameters instead of symptoms and is a critical step to growing access to equitable healthcare across the global community,' Richter explained. 'Using a compact home unit, a patient with a Microtech-enabled implant can deliver immediate and highly accurate pressure readings directly to their physician turning geographical distance or mobility challenges into a non-issue.'

Arab leaders urging Trump to replace Mahmoud Abbas	The Arab leaders revealed that not only is Abbas preventing an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, but he is also obstructing efforts to resolve the situation in Gaza due to his political weakness and low popularity. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Arab leaders are urging President-elect Donald Trump to take measures to replace Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas amid the PA’s floundering effort to crack down on Jenin-area terror groups. An Arab diplomat, who took part in a series of meetings recently held by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s new Middle East advisor, told The Press Service of Israel that a series of Arab leaders said they see no reason to have any diplomatic contact with Abbas. TPS-IL was told that these demanded that new US administration act as soon as possible to bring about the establishment of a new Palestinian leadership, if the administration intends to bring about a permanent solution in the Gaza Strip. The Arab leaders told Witkoff that not only is Abbas preventing a comprehensive agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, but he is also obstructing efforts to resolve the situation in Gaza due to his political weakness and low popularity. 'The plan to restore Palestinian governance in Gaza, the one that Abu Mazen sent to the White House several months ago, was rejected outright and the Americans are not willing to discuss it due to the understanding that Abu Mazen [Abbas] cannot constitute a governing force in the Gaza Strip,' the source told TPS-IL. He explained that Abbas launched a crackdown on terror groups in Jenin 'to demonstrate his governing capabilities, but for now there is no change in the position of the moderate Arab countries on this matter.' Palestinian sources told TPS-IL that Abbas’s plan to restore PA governance to Gaza was not discussed at any Cabinet meetings and is not familiar to members of the Fatah Central Committee. The sources said Abbas’s plan was apparently only shared with three close associates: intelligence chief Majed Faraj, Prime Minister Muhammad Mustafa, and senior Palestine Liberation Organization figure Hussein al-Sheikh. 'The Palestinian Authority now has no possibility of influencing the emerging situation in the Gaza Strip, and apart from the plan that was sent to the White House after being hastily prepared, there is no real Palestinian strategy,' one Palestinian source told TPS-IL. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority security operations against terror groups in Jenin have shown no successes after 19 days. A senior PA official told TPS-IL during the initial raids that the crackdown was part of a broader strategy to demonstrate PA authority’s ability to maintain governance as Ramallah eyes eventually administering the Gaza Strip. The Arab diplomat told TPS-IL that Arab leaders see the PA’s action as insufficient. Palestinians have not held national elections since 2005 and Abbas is now in the 19th year of what was supposed to be a four-year term. Since then, Abbas has cancelled several attempted elections amid Fatah-Hamas disagreements, most recently in 2021. The most recent public opinion survey, released by the Ramallah-based Arab World for Research and Development in mid-December, found 71% of Palestinians were dissatisfied with the leadership of PA President Mahmoud Abbas. Reasons included not providing a vision for the postcrisis period (76%), limited communication with the public (77%) and dissatisfaction with his approach to governance (73%) The post Arab leaders urging Trump to replace Mahmoud Abbas appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/arab-leaders-urging-trump-to-replace-mahmoud-abbas/	2024-12-26T08:31:20-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AP22266547201810.jpg
IAF hits Houthi terror sites across Yemen, including airport in S...	The strikes came during a televised address by Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. By JNS The Israeli Air Force conducted strikes on the western coast of and deep inside Yemen on Thursday evening, including Sanaa International Airport in the Houthi-controlled capital, the IDF said. The targets included the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations, in addition to terror infrastructure in the Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports. 'These military targets were used by the Houthi terrorist regime to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials. This is a further example of the Houthis’ exploitation of civilian infrastructure for military purposes,' the IDF said. 'The Houthi terrorist regime is a central part of the Iranian axis of terror, and their attacks on international shipping vessels and routes continue to destabilize the region and the wider world. … The IDF will not hesitate to operate at any distance against any threat to the State of Israel and its citizens,' added the statement. The strikes came during a televised address by Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. 'Israel’s deterrence has failed against our country,' al-Houthi reportedly said. 'The Israeli enemy knows that our operations continue, they are effective and influential. Our missiles, which the [Israeli] defense systems did not succeed in intercepting, have caused great frustration in Israel and the U.S.,' he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday threatened Yemen’s Houthis, speaking at his office in Jerusalem before lighting the menorah on the first night of Chanukah. 'Like then, we are striking at our enemies. … The Houthis will also learn what Hamas, Hezbollah, the Assad regime and others have learned, and this will also take time. This lesson will be learned across the Middle East,' he said. On Tuesday, Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened to target the Houthi leadership. 'I warned and said that just as we dealt with [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar in Gaza, [Hamas leader Ismail] Haniyeh in Tehran and [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah in Beirut, we will also deal with the heads of the Houthis in Sanaa and everywhere in Yemen,' said Katz. Hours later, Israel’s Arrow 3 air-defense system intercepted a Houthi ballistic missile. The projectile was downed before crossing into Israeli airspace, but air-raid sirens were triggered across much of central Israel due to the threat of falling shrapnel. Seven people were injured attempting to reach protected areas in the greater Tel Aviv and Judean Foothills (Shfela) regions, while two people were treated for anxiety, according to the Magen David Adom emergency medical service. Houthi terrorists have launched over 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The terrorist group has escalated its attacks in recent days, scoring hits on Israel’s densely populated central region. Overnight Monday, a woman in her 60s was critically injured when she struck her head while rushing to a shelter in Tel Aviv during sirens triggered by another Houthi missile. MDA paramedics treated 25 people who were lightly hurt running to shelters or who suffered anxiety attacks. Earlier on Monday, the IDF shot down a Houthi attack drone before it crossed into Israeli airspace. Shortly before dawn last Thursday, the warhead from an intercepted missile hit an elementary school in Ramat Gan, collapsing the school’s main building but causing no injuries. Following a failed interception overnight Friday, a missile hit a playground in a residential area of Jaffa, lightly wounding 16 people. The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency session on Monday to discuss the escalating Houthi attacks, at Israel’s request. Muhammad Ali al-Houthi, a member of the Houthi Supreme Political Council that governs parts of Yemen, said on Tuesday that he 'does not fear the Jews.' In 1900, there were about 50,000 Jews in Yemen. Following centuries of discrimination and persecution, Israel’s 'Operation Magic Carpet' from 1949 to 1950 brought nearly all remaining Yemenite Jews home. The last one remaining, Levi Marhabi, has been imprisoned by the Houthis since 2016 for allegedly helping a Jewish family flee with a Torah scroll. Muhammad Ali al-Houthi continued, 'The Yemeni people will continue to support the Gaza Strip, no matter the sacrifices.' The people of Yemen 'do not fear the Jews and do not care about any threats, but rather consider them hollow statements,' he said.

Knesset clears path for dismissal of attorney general	Israel's budget crisis was resolved after coalition leadership in an unprecedented step authorized the justice minister to initiate the process of dismissing the attorney general. By JNS Israel’s coalition leaders reached a decisive agreement on Monday night authorizing Justice Minister Yariv Levin to begin formal proceedings toward the dismissal of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. The agreement was reached during a critical coalition meeting that Levin left early, according to senior government sources. Following the authorization, the Knesset successfully passed an amendment to the 2024 budget early on Tuesday morning. The next phase requires Levin to initiate formal dismissal procedures, including conducting mandatory hearings, before presenting final recommendations to the government, Justice Ministry sources told Channel 12 News. The process establishes the legal groundwork to divide the attorney general’s current responsibilities into separate positions. The development follows sustained pressure from Otzma Yehudit Party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir, though coalition representatives maintain that the decision stems from broader governance considerations rather than specific political demands. Otzma Yehudit, which had previously blocked budget proceedings and threatened to stop voting with the coalition unless proceedings to fire the attorney general were initiated, supported Tuesday’s budget vote. Sources in the party said according to Ma’ariv that while they voted with the coalition on the budget amendment, this does not constitute a 'blank check.' the sources confirmed that they would continue to monitor Levin’s implementation of the dismissal process. The authorization coincides with separate discussions regarding proposed changes to the Judicial Selection Committee, which sources close to Levin cite as his primary focus during the coalition meeting. However, other coalition members disputed this characterization and suggested that the minister’s early departure was due to strategic considerations regarding the dismissal proceedings. Legal experts note that this marks the first case in Israeli history of formal proceedings initiated against a sitting attorney general. The Justice Ministry has not released an official timeline for the completion of required hearings and subsequent government deliberations. The budget, passed in second and third readings early on Tuesday, incorporates additional provisions for wartime expenditures. Finance Ministry officials confirm the amended budget maintains original defense allocations while adding emergency funding measures. Government sources indicate the coalition leadership will proceed with the dismissal process through established legal channels, emphasizing adherence to procedural requirements to prevent intervention by the Supreme Court.

Hamas says list of hostages will be provided only after truce beg...	Spokesman for Gaza terror group claims Hamas has provided partial lists of hostages to Israel, but has been unable to get information on all captives due to ongoing war. By World Israel News Staff Hamas will only provide a full list of hostages held in the Gaza Strip after a ceasefire is agreed upon and implemented in the coastal enclave, a spokesman for the terror group said Wednesday night. Speaking with the London-based Qatari-owned Al-Araby Al-Jadeed outlet, an unnamed senior Hamas official pushed back on claims by Israel that the group has consistently refused to provide a detailed list of the remaining captives and their condition. The official told the news agency that Hamas has already handed over whatever information it has on hostages held by its operatives, but emphasized that information regarding captives held by other terror groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, remains scant, due to the war. Denying claims that Mohammed Sinwar, commander of Hamas' military wing, has refused to provide details regarding the condition of Israeli captives, the official said that it was simply 'impossible' to gather all of the information requested by Israel so long as the 'situation' continues in the Gaza Strip. Hamas has held talks, he claimed, with other Gaza-based terror groups, but added that a complete hostage list could not be drawn up until a ceasefire deal is reached and put into effect. Israel's negotiating team left Doha, Qatar this week, after failing to reach a breakthrough in talks with Hamas. According to the Hamas official cited in Wednesday's report, one of the main remaining stumbling blocks in the talks is issue of 'high-profile' jailed terrorists. As part of a deal to release Israeli hostages, Israel would free hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists. However, Hamas has demanded that Israel release some prominent terrorist figures, including those convicted of murder, as part of such a deal. Israel has thus far refused to agree to free Marwan Barghouti, terrorist mastermind from the Second Intifada, along with Hassan Salameh, Ahmad Sa'adat, Abbas al-Sayed, and others whose release Hamas has sought.

How IDF intelligence led to Hezbollah’s defeat	Israel’s success included decapitation of its senior echelon, destruction and capture of vast numbers of weapons, and killing thousands of terrorists. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel’s success in defeating Hezbollah was due to meticulous IDF intelligence work that spanned years, the IDF said Wednesday. Using all kinds of intelligence sources, the army found out who was in charge of all of Hezbollah’s various branches, the location of their most dangerous weapons, such as short- and long-range missiles and rockets, and how all the units worked, including its elite invasion forces. They also discovered and kept constant track of where the senior echelon and the group’s lethal long-range weapons were located. Thus it was not luck when in the space of a few short weeks this fall, the top three echelons of Hezbollah’s military command were assassinated, including the organization’s head, Hassan Nasrallah. Nor was it coincidence that the air force managed to destroy tens of thousands of rockets, including most if not all of Hezbollah’s arsenal of long-range precision missiles. Through its 'unprecedented' intelligence penetration, Hezbollah plans that have come to light regarding air strikes on the IDF’s Kirya headquarters as well as other landmarks in Tel Aviv such as the tall, commercial Azrieli towers that could have potentially killed thousands, were never realized. Channel 12 also reported Wednesday on Hezbollah’s plans and IDF successes that completely changed the military arena in the north. According to the report, the Iranian proxy terror group had planned to fire 16,000 rockets at Israel over a period of two days after Hamas’ October 7 surprise invasion and massacre of 1,200 people near the Gazan border. It had also intended to send its 1,700-strong Radwan force within hours over the border to wreak havoc among Israel’s northern villages and towns, followed by 5,000 more fighters within two days. Then, over the next month, it had wanted to launch 2-3,000 aerial projectiles a day, mostly aimed at metropolitan Haifa, the report said. Municipal authorities have warned for years that the huge chemical storage sites in the city should be moved, as a successful missile attack could lead to the deaths of thousands of residents. IDF intelligence knew of these plans, however, and the army acted quickly on October 7, sending 67,000 reservists northward within 17 hours, which deterred a Hezbollah ground invasion. While according to the IDF the terrorists did initially fire dozens of short-range missiles and anti-tank shells, and carried out around 90 attacks on Israeli territory, the air force responded by striking Hezbollah launch sites in Lebanon to prevent any mass launch. It then continually kept up the pressure, bombing weapons facilities, command and control centers and other military sites throughout the months that the army’s main focus was on eliminating the Hamas threat in Gaza. Although Hezbollah did escalate their air attacks, also introducing UAVs into the equation and managing to cause a great deal of property damage in the north, loss of life was limited to a few dozen soldiers and civilians, including twelve Druze children in one attack, and the center of the country, where the majority of Israel’s population lived, was mostly safe. The way IDF intelligence managed to trick Hezbollah into buying thousands of pagers it had booby-trapped, a plan it worked on for two years, was perhaps the largest Intelligence coup of the war. After they were detonated on September 17, killing some 30 Hezbollah operatives and wounded 3,000 others, the terrorists were not only down in number but dispirited and earlier this month agreed to a ceasefire pushing their forces miles away from the border. All together to date, Israel has eliminated 3,850 terrorists and wounded about 9,000, with most of the elite fighters in the Radwan force either dead or injured. Some 80% of Hezbollah’s longer-range missiles have been destroyed, and over 85,000 military items have been found and confiscated. These include over 10,000 launchers and rockets, including RPGs, Kornet missiles and mortar shells as well as about 60 surface-to-air missiles, some 9,000 explosive devices, thousands of rifles, and over 60,000 items of electronic equipment, including computers and communication devices.

Tel Aviv Stock Exchange opens floodgates for crypto trading	Starting Dec. 31, regular Israeli investors can put their shekels directly into funds that track actual Bitcoin prices. By Jewish Breaking News The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is finally joining the crypto revolution, and the timing couldn’t be better, with Bitcoin trading at $94,200 after skyrocketing 113% in just the past year. For Israeli investors who’ve been itching to get into crypto but wanted the safety of regulated investment products, the wait is almost over. The country’s biggest financial players are bringing Bitcoin to the masses, including IBI-Kessem, Meitav, More, and Migdal. All four have already filed paperwork to launch Bitcoin tracking funds next week. Not to be left behind, Ayalon is cooking up its own managed fund. There’s just one snag: Bitcoin funds won’t trade like regular stocks. Instead of buying and selling throughout the day, investors will have to place orders that only get filled once daily. But that’s likely to change after approval for Bitcoin tracking was finally granted last week by Israel’s Securities Authority (ISA). 'The investment houses have been pleading for more than a year for ETFs to be approved and started sending prospectuses for Bitcoin funds in the middle of the year. But the regulator marches to its own tune. It has to check the details,' a senior executive at an investment house tells Calcalist. The dominos started falling when U.S. regulators made their own historic move earlier this year, letting investment houses create ETFs that directly track Bitcoin. Israel’s regulators followed suit, first opening the door to crypto futures trading in April, then taking it a step further in August by letting non-bank stock exchange members handle crypto trading and custody services. Starting Dec. 31, regular Israeli investors can put their shekels directly into funds that track actual Bitcoin prices. No more dealing with futures contracts, foreign currencies, or crypto exchanges. Just straightforward investment through Israel’s biggest, most trusted financial firms.'

‘Environmental terrorism’: Illegal Palestinian dumping turns Jude...	The Palestinian Authority has failed to address these issues—both through negligence and intentional disregard—turning pollution and environmental hazards into immediate health and ecological threats for all Israelis and Palestinians,' said Environmental Protection Minister Idit Silman. By Sveta Listratov, TPS A comprehensive environmental hazards in Judea and Samaria report released on Wednesday paints a grim picture of severe air, water, and soil contamination. The report highlights the environmental, economic, and health consequences of ongoing neglect and abuse, primarily stemming from untreated waste and sewage in areas under Palestinian Authority jurisdiction. The report, prepared by the Green Now and Regavim non-governmental organizations estimates the annual economic damage to Judea and Samaria at 2.6 billion shekels ($710 million). Green Now is an environmental think-tank. Regavim monitors illegal Palestinian construction in Judea and Samaria. At the report’s release — in an abandoned quarry-garbage dump incineration site near Psagot north of Jerusalem — the air was thick with the acrid smell of burning and decomposing waste, making it difficult to breathe even with face masks provided for the attendees. The stench could be smelled from kilometers away. Surrounding the crater, piles of decomposing garbage were scattered across the area, including tires, cartons, plastic, construction materials, and unidentifiable debris. The dump is located in Area C of Judea and Samaria, where Israel has both administrative and security jurisdiction. Environmental Protection Minister Idit Silman told The Press Service of Israel that the dump was in stark contrast from the spirit of the UN’s recent COP29 conference on climate change in Azerbaijan. 'Around the world, nations are facing shared environmental challenges—water shortages, desertification, and pollution. Israel, though small, is a global leader in innovation, from desalination to sustainable waste management. These are tools we can share with the world, but we must first address the chaos in our backyard,' she told TPS-IL. Speaking at the gathering, Silman said she would shift responsibility for Judea and Samaria’s environmental governance to her ministry from the Israel Defense Force’s Civil Administration. 'Environmental threats do not recognize borders, nationalities, or political agreements,' Silman said. 'The Palestinian Authority has failed to address these issues—both through negligence and intentional disregard—turning pollution and environmental hazards into immediate health and ecological threats for all Israelis and Palestinians.' Said Silman, 'We face over 100 illegal dumping sites being burned across Judea and Samaria every day—from the northern regions to southern Mount Hebron. For too long, environmental management in the region has been neglected. ' Voicing the frustrations of local residents, Israel Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, called for decisive government action. 'Law is law, and quality of life is non-negotiable. Every Israeli citizen deserves it,' said Gantz. 'We cannot keep living with sewage from Al-Bireh running through our valleys or the smoke from fires polluting our air. Hostile foreign actors are weaponizing the environment as a form of terrorism.' From the A-Ram Quarry overlook in Tel Zion, a vast site where heavy machinery and tractors are visibly active, the scale of the environmental challenge became even more evident. The dumping generates hazardous clouds of dust that drift directly to the nearby community of Tel Zion, less than five kilometers away, home to around 1,000 families. Residents shared their frustrations, including Yair, a father from the nearby community of Tel Zion, who said the quarry is a focal point of pollution. 'For 20 years, we’ve endured the dust, but now, with the dumpster fires, it’s a nightmare. This is environmental terrorism. How can we raise children in such conditions?' Yair said. 'We need real action. It’s not just about dust anymore—there are people here with asthma, and the air quality makes life unbearable.' Said Regavim director Meir Deutsch, 'The Palestinian Authority is not part of the solution; it’s part of the problem. Environmental sovereignty must rest with Israel to ensure accountability and enforcement.' Green Now Director General Barak Werker praised the Environmental Protection Ministry for taking action. 'This is not just about reports; it’s about results,' Werker said. 'Without immediate intervention, these problems will only deepen.'

Actress Emmanuelle Chriqui talks about Jewish pride, growing up i...	She said in a previous interview that she includes a clause in her acting contracts, stating that she will not work on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Jewish actress Emmanuelle Chriqui opened up in a podcast interview on Tuesday about being raised in a Modern Orthodox household in Canada, being proud to be Jewish and how pro-Israel activists in Hollywood inspire her. Chriqui, 49, was born to Moroccan Jewish immigrants in Montreal, Canada. Her late mother, Liliane, was born in Casablanca, while her late father, Albert, was born in Rabat and moved to Casablanca as a child. Growing up herself in Canada, Chriqui kept kosher at home and celebrated Shabbat every week with her family. 'I was raised in a small town outside of Toronto and we were two Jewish families but I lived in, I would consider, a Modern Orthodox home,' the former 'Entourage' star told Jewish comedian Elon Gold during a guest appearance on his podcast 'Stars of David with Elon Gold.' 'We did Shabbat dinner every Friday [and] Shabbat lunch Saturday. Dad went to temple,' she said. 'All our biggest fights were [about] going out on Friday night. And my mom was an extraordinary cook. In Canada in the winter time, I would race home from school [on Fridays] so I could plug in the water, light the candles, cuz I’d be the first one home, turn the oven on low, all the things. We had milk and meat separate at home.' The 'You Don’t Mess with the Zohan' star added that she still lights Shabbat candles every week in her home. She also noted that her favorite Jewish holiday is Rosh Hashanah. Explaining why, she said: 'I love new beginnings; renewal. I love the symbolism, the food, [and] as much as I dread that it means Yom Kippur is around the corner, I love this time and I love how I feel after Yom Kippur.' She said in a previous interview that she includes a clause in her acting contracts, stating that she will not work on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. Chriqui has been an avid supporter of Israel for many years. After the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack in Israel last year, she expressed solidarity with Israel and its right to defend itself against Hamas. She signed an open letter condemning the US-designated terrorist organization, has advocated for the release of the hostages still held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and shared posts on social media about the need to bring the hostages home. She has also supported efforts to counteract boycotts of Israel, including efforts to have Israel banned from the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest. Since 2020, Chriqui has been in a relationship with American actor Sam Trammell, who in early 2024 condemned antisemitism. 'Obviously this past year has been incredibly confronting on so many levels and things have come up that I’ve never lived through before,' Chriqui said during her podcast interview this week, referring to the global experiencing a rise in antisemitism since the Oct. 7 attack. She also said she thinks the 'silver lining' of this past year has been seeing how Jews in Hollywood are embracing their Judaism in different ways than perhaps before the Oct. 7 massacre. 'Like in my 20-plus years of being in Los Angeles, it’s never been like this. Like I can’t keep up with the invitations,' she said. 'It’s never been that way. Jews, fellow Jews that were like Jew-ish, suddenly it means something different. And I think that’s the thing – being Jewish in this moment has taken on a different meaning.' She said 'very much so,' Jews are starting to express pride and unity in their Jewish heritage that she has not seen before. She also told Gold that Jewish friends and pro-Israel advocates in the Hollywood community inspire her, including Hen Mazzig, Noa Tishby, Mandana Dayani and Montana Tucker. 'I’m very inspired by all of them,' she explained. Chriqui was also asked about the backlash that some Jewish celebrities receive for not speaking out publicly either enough or at all in support of Israel. 'In the beginning, I think the sentiment was that we felt so alone so who are the Jews who have millions of followers that can affect change,' she said in response. 'But it’s also about releasing expectations; releasing judgments. What I might do works for me, might not work for you. And I think really we need to be more tolerate with each other, especially within the community. That’s something that breaks my heart a little bit.' 'I think that speaking out against antisemitism on my platform, for me, is about standing tall in who I am. So it’s much less about what happened but really embracing who we are,' she noted.

IDF soldier KIA in Gaza brings wartime death toll to 822	His funeral was scheduled for Thursday at 3 p.m. local time at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem. By JNS An Israel Defense Forces reservist was killed in combat in the central Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the military said on Thursday morning. He was identified as Capt. (res.) Amit Levi, 35, from Shomria, a religious kibbutz in southern Israel. His funeral was scheduled for Thursday at 3 p.m. local time at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem. His death brings the IDF’s total death toll since the start of the war on Oct. 7, 2023, to 822, and to 390 since the start of Gaza ground operations on Oct. 27, 2023. The IDF on Monday night announced that three IDF soldiers had been killed fighting Hamas terrorists in northern Gaza. They were identified as Capt. Ilay Gavriel Atedgi, 22, from Kiryat Motzkin; Staff Sgt. Netanel Pessach, 21, from Elazar; and Sgt. 1st Class (res.) Hillel Diener, 21, from Talmon. All three served in the Shimshon Battalion 92 of the military’s Kfir Brigade, the announcement noted.

As Israel negotiates possible withdrawal, defense chief vows IDF ...	Israel reportedly in talks with Hamas for a staggered withdrawal from large parts of the Gaza Strip - but Defense Minister Israel Katz insists IDF will retain security control of the enclave. By World Israel News Staff The IDF will retain security control over the Gaza Strip, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz pledged Wednesday, even as Israel's negotiating team has been in talks with Hamas for a ceasefire and hostage deal which would include a withdrawal from most of the coastal enclave. Prior to the departure of the Israeli delegation from Doha this week, negotiators discussed the current proposal on the table for a three-stage ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages in exchange for the freeing of hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists. As part of the proposed ceasefire agreement, Israel would withdraw from large swaths of the Gaza Strip, though Jerusalem has insisted the IDF remain in control over several key strategic areas, including the Philadelphi Corridor on the Egypt-Gaza border, the Netzarim Corridor separating northern and southern Gaza, and a buffer zone running parallel to the Israeli border. During a visit to the Philadelphi Corridor Wednesday, Defense Minister Katz insisted that the IDF would retain 'security control' in Gaza, without specifying the nature of that control, and whether the Israeli military would cede large portions of the Gaza Strip to either Palestinian control or a foreign Arab peacekeeping force. 'I came to visit Gaza to meet the commanders and soldiers who are doing a great job, displaying bravery, resourcefulness, and determination, while the need to create conditions to free the hostages and ensure Israel's security is in their sights,' Katz said during his tour of the Philadelphi Corridor, accompanied by Southern Command Commanding Officer Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and Gaza Division Commander Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram. 'Security will remain in the hands of the IDF which will be able to work in every way to remove threats, prevent tunnels, prevent terrorist infrastructure, and prevent terrorists from organizing and attempting to harm the State of Israel and IDF soldiers.' 'We will make sure that what we saw as far as infiltration tunnels, what we saw as far as threats, while we saw this heroic war that destroyed these capabilities - will not return. We will make sure that the security control will be in the hands of the IDF which will be allowed to work in every location to prevent threats.' Katz compared Israel's security measures in Gaza to steps taken in Lebanon and Syria, referencing 'security areas' and 'buffer zones.' Israel is in the midst of withdrawing from southern Lebanon, in keeping with a 60-day ceasefire deal which went into effect on November 27th. In Syria, Israel has moved troops into the 96-square-mile demilitarized zone on the Syrian-side of the Golan Heights. Jerusalem has insisted the move, taken after rebel forces ousted President Bashar Assad on December 8th, is temporary, though Hebrew news reports indicate the military as been instructed to prepare to remain in the DMZ through 2025.

Israel to send UN report on torture, enslavement, sex abuse of ho...	The report also focuses on their difficulties in returning to normal life after being freed. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel is sending a report to the United Nations soon detailing the torture and sex abuse the hostages underwent at the hands of their terrorist captors in Gaza as well as its ongoing consequences, Channel 12 reported Thursday. Doctors and psychologists from the Ministries of Health and Welfare and Social Affairs authored the report after collecting testimonies of both the children and adults who were brutally abducted last October 7 during the Hamas-led invasion and massacre, and were released some two months later in a hostage deal. There was both physical and psychological torture, and the age of the hostages made no difference. The report details how many children were purposely separated from their parents. They were forced to watch footage of the terrorists slaughtering people during their rampage through Gaza-border communities, and witnessed fellow hostages dying in front of their eyes. Some were branded on their legs with a hot iron so that they would be easily spotted if they managed to escape. They were constantly threatened with violence if they spoke aloud, and the threats were carried out. Both children and adults suffered repeated sexual abuse. Some female captives also became slaves to their captors, forced to cook and clean for their families. They were tied hand and foot for long periods of time and were deliberately starved, often only receiving one small meal a day. Among the adults, some underwent surgery or painful procedures for the wounds sustained during their capture – without anesthetic. Others were forced to defecate on themselves instead of being allowed to use the bathroom. The second part of the report deals with the difficult aftermath of their experiences. Some continue to suffer from acute trauma and panic attacks, and have difficulty leaving their homes or speaking in a regular tone of voice. They complain of having severe pains that have no medical explanation. Children can’t sleep by themselves, and exhibit great trauma related to food, hiding it, avoiding eating, or going to the other extreme and massively overeating. Many have yet to return to their normal lives, whether going to school or to work. All the doctors and psychologists that the media outlet contacted said that without exception, the hostages say that they cannot fully acclimate to their freedom knowing that there are still hostages left in the terror tunnels of Gaza, suffering still as they had, but over a year later. Out of the hundred still held captive, 34 are known dead but most expect that at best, perhaps 50 are still alive, with many saying that number is probably much lower.

Ancient oil lamp, decorated with Temple symbols, discovered in Je...	Rare find sheds light on Jewish community in Jerusalem under Roman occupation after the Bar Kochba revolt. By World Israel News Staff A rare ceramic oil lamp from the Late Roman period, decorated with depictions of the Temple menorah, incense shovel and lulav (date palm branch used in Jewish ritual), was recently uncovered during an Israel Antiquities Authority archaeological dig near the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. The find, which, judging by the soot marks on its nozzle, was used for lighting about 1,700 years ago, provides a glimpse into Jewish cultural and religious life during this period. 'The exquisite artistic workmanship of the lamp, which was found complete, makes it an outstanding and extremely rare ' says Michael Chernin, excavation director on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. 'The menorah, incense shovel and lulav are symbols associated with the Jewish connection to the Temple. This finding is particularly surprising, since, we have very little evidence of the existence of a Jewish settlement in and around Jerusalem from this period.' 'After the Roman emperor Hadrian suppressed the Bar Kochba rebellion in 135 CE, Jews were expelled from the city. The Mount of Olives lamp is one of the few material traces of a Jewish presence around Jerusalem in the 3rd-5th centuries CE.' According to Benjamin Storchan, Israel Antiquities Authority research archaeologist, the lamp belongs to the 'Beit Nattif' type, named after its production workshop identified in the 1930's near Bet Shemesh. The nozzle and lamp shoulders were decorated with geometric designs and the center features a detailed deception of the seven branched menorah with a tripod base. Oil lamps with menorah decorations are exceedingly rare and only a few similar Beit Nattif type lamps can be found in the National Treasures archive. The choice of symbols on the lamp is not accidental. 'This is a fascinating testimony connecting everyday objects and faiths among ancient Jerusalem’s inhabitants,' said Storchan. 'It seems that the lamp belonged to a Jew, who purchased it because of its religious affiliation and memorial to the Temple.' 'It is evident that the lamp maker dedicated a great deal of time and effort to its decoration' adds Storchan. 'The lamp was made using delicately and intricately carved limestone molds using drills and chisels. The molds were made in two parts (upper and lower).' 'To create the lamp, the potter pressed the clay into the molds then pressed together. Finally, the vessel was fired, and it could be used. This method of producing lamps in molds allowed for refined designs, as well as the addition of delicate and intricate decorations.' 'The Temple menorah became a Jewish symbol in the Second Temple period. However, after the Temple’s destruction, the menorah image became an important icon in the Jewish collective memory both within Israel and the Diaspora.' 'The menorah occasionally appears on personal objects such as oil lamps, which – being an illumination vessel, perhaps evoked a feeling of lighting the Temple menorah.'

How will Israel deter future Houthi attacks?	Netanyahu pledges that Houthis will learn 'the same lessons' as Hezbollah and Hamas. By World Israel News Staff Israel is currently planning for more intensive strikes on the Yemen-based Houthis, including assassinations of the terror group's leaders. Previous Israeli strikes on Houthi-controlled infrastructure, including ports and oil assets, have failed to deter the Houthis from launching ballistic missiles and explosive drones at Israel. During a Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged that the Houthis would suffer the same fate as other Iranian proxies that attacked Israel. 'The Houthis will learn what Hamas and Hezbollah and the Assad regime and others learned, and even if it takes time, this lesson will be learned throughout the Middle East,' Netanyahu said. An anonymous security source told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet that Israel is gearing up for strikes on Houthi leadership and weapons depots, which may be carried out with the U.S. 'The Houthis will pay a heavy price, there will be a ratcheting up of Israeli attacks,' the official said. 'But it’s nothing compared to what will happen once Trump enters office. The Americans are planning to impose an embargo on them and sanctions.' The source added that Israel perceives the Houthis as a 'tough nut to crack.' In recent weeks, the Houthis have escalated their attacks against the Jewish State. Last Thursday, a Ramat Gan elementary school was destroyed by a Houthi missile, triggering retaliatory Israeli airstrikes on Houthi-controlled ports and oil facilities in Yemen. Undeterred by the strikes, the Houthis launched a missile in the early hours of Saturday morning, which struck a park in south Tel Aviv, wounding 16. On Tuesday, the Houthis launched another missile, which sent approximately 4 million Israelis scrambling to bomb shelters. One woman was seriously injured in a fall while running to safety. The missile was intercepted. Another launch on Wednesday was shot down, but shrapnel from the interception damaged a home in the central Israel town of Be'er Yaakov. A drone launched by the Houthis late Wednesday afternoon triggered sirens in the southern city of Ashkelon and surrounding areas. The drone was not intercepted, and crashed in an open area, according to the IDF.

‘Israel will be forced to attack Iran soon’ – Former DM	An Israeli strike on Iran will happen in the near future, says former defense minister Yoav Gallant. By World Israel News Staff Israel will need to directly attack Iran 'in the near future,' former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said at a Hannukah candle-lighting ceremony on Wednesday evening. Speaking at the holiday event in Ramat Gan, Gallant said that the losses suffered by Hezbollah and Hamas during the ongoing war had weakened Iran. Gallant said that Israel will partner with the U.S. on missions to eliminate the Yemen-based Houthi leadership and their weapons depots. These joint operations are 'preparation for future action we will need to take against Iran,' he said. He added that a strike on Iran would happen 'in the near future.' It is Israel's 'duty' to 'remove the threat' of Iran and its proxies, Gallant stressed. The former defense minister noted that the ongoing holiday of Hanukkah commemorates an unlikely military triumph. 'There is nothing like the holiday of Hanukkah that shows the victory of spirit over might, the victory of the few over the many, and the legacy of heroism - which began in those days and continues today,' Gallant said. According to Hebrew-language media reports, the Mossad intelligence agency is urging a decisive strike against Iran, rather than focusing military assets on fighting the Houthis. 'We need to go head-on against Iran,' Mossad head David Barnea was quoted as saying by Channel 13 News. 'If we only attack the Houthis, it’s not certain that we’ll be able to stop them.' Other reports quoted Barnea as emphasizing the importance of going after the 'head of the snake,' arguing that the Houthis are doing the Iranians' bidding. According to the report, Netanyahu said that an attack on Iran is a 'different issue,' which will be dealt with 'at the appropriate time.'

Gaza famine report withdrawn after ‘irresponsible’ exaggerations	It is irresponsible to issue a report like this,' says outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew. By World Israel News Staff A report claiming that the Gaza Strip is enduring an ongoing famine was withdrawn, following criticism by the U.S. Ambassador to Israel regarding the document's methodology and claims. The Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) published a report on Tuesday which charged that civilians in the northern district of the Strip are suffering from 'acute malnutrition,' according to calculations made based on the number of people in the area and the amount of humanitarian aid entering the region. FEWS NET is an entity created in 1985 by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Department of State, which aims to track global food insecurity. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew noted that the FEWS NET report appeared to use outdated data, as well as dramatically exaggerated the number of civilians in the area, which appeared to have been inflated by five to ten times the actual number. 'The report issued today on Gaza by FEWS NET relies on data that is outdated and inaccurate,' Lew wrote on his official X account. 'It is now apparent that the civilian population in that part of Gaza is in the range of 7,000-15,000, not 65,000-75,000, which is the basis of this report,' he continued. 'At a time when inaccurate information is causing confusion and accusations, it is irresponsible to issue a report like this. We work day and night with the UN and our Israeli partners to meet humanitarian needs — which are great — and relying on inaccurate data is irresponsible.' Much of the humanitarian aid which enters the Strip is stolen by Hamas or armed looting gangs. The vast majority of the aid meant to be distributed to civilians is usurped by strongmen and sold to the population at exorbitant prices. On Wednesday, FEWS NET unpublished the report.

Netanyahu hints at major IDF campaign against Houthis	The Houthis will learn what Hamas and Hezbollah learned,' says Israeli prime minister on the first night of Hanukkah. By World Israel News Staff Following a string of missile attacks on Israel by pro-Iranian Houthi rebels in Yemen, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted that the IDF is poised to target the rebel group's leadership, warning that it will suffer the same fate as Hamas and Hezbollah. At an event in the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem Wednesday evening marking the first night of Hanukkah, Prime Minister Netanyahu list the Hanukkah candles together with PMO employees and senior officials, and their children. Also attending the lighting were Orna and Ronen Neutra, who met with the Prime Minister earlier today, the parents of Capt. Omer Neutra of blessed memory, an IDF Armored Corps officer who fell in the fighting in the Western Negev on October 7th and whose body was taken hostage by Hamas. 'Today we are lighting the first candle of Chanukah to mark the victory of the Maccabees then, and also the victory of 'the Maccabees of today,' Netanyahu said after the candle lighting . 'Like then, we are striking at our enemies, and those who thought they could cut the thread of our lives here then, this will apply to them all.' 'The Houthis will also learn what Hamas, Hezbollah, the Assad regime and others have learned, and this will also take time. This lesson will be learned across the Middle East, I tell you, in those days at this season.' Netanyahu's comments echoed similar warnings by Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud), who said this week that Houthi leaders would suffer the same fate as the late Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in an Israeli operation in Iran. 'Just as we took care of Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will deal with the heads of the Houthis in Sana’a or anywhere in Yemen,' Katz said.

Hostage family chanukah gathering evacuated due to security threa...	Israel Police: 'In response to reports of a suspicious individual in the Tel Aviv area, we are conducting extensive searches and operational activities.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Wednesday night, police evacuated a candle-lighting ceremony held by hostage families because of a security threat. The event was held across from IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv. The Israel Police stated, 'In response to reports of a suspicious individual in the Tel Aviv area, we are conducting extensive searches and operational activities. The investigation is ongoing, and no further details about the incident are available at this time.' A senior source reported that a terror-suspect from Jenin entered the Tel Aviv area, and as a result, there was a perceived threat to the candle lighting ceremony. Last month, the IDF conducted an extensive raid on Jenin. Five Palestinian militants were killed as Israeli security forces dismantled four explosives laboratories in Jenin. The military reported seizing weapons components and five lathes used in weapon production. Additionally, a warehouse used by terrorist groups to store cameras and dozens of explosives were destroyed. Seven suspected militants were also arrested. Last week, Palestinian Authority security forces continued a rare crackdown on terror strongholds in Jenin. An Israeli military source described the raids to The Press Service of Israel as 'the most serious Palestinian operation in recent years.' The operation prompted a general strike across the area, with businesses, schools, and UNRWA offices closing in protest. Human rights organizations are urging the PA to end the campaign. Dubbed 'Operation Homeland Defense,' PA forces have taken control of four neighborhoods in the Jenin refugee camp, surrounded hospitals, and conducted thorough searches in alleyways. A Palestinian Authority source told TPS-IL that the raids were personally ordered by PA President Mahmoud Abbas, who instructed security forces, 'Do not return until you have full control of the camp, no matter the cost.' During the operation, PA forces killed Yazid Ja’isa, a commander in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group. Ja’isa had previously clashed with the PA, including an incident where he seized weapons from Palestinian police stationed at Joseph’s Tomb and threatened to exchange them for the release of imprisoned Islamic Jihad members in Jericho.

Marwan Barghouti tops Palestinian polls for PA leadership as fami...	The AWRAD survey also found 71% of Palestinians were dissatisfied with the leadership of PA President Mahmoud Abbas. By Pesach Benson, TPS As the family of imprisoned Palestinian terror commander Marwan Barghouti lobbies for his release in a widely anticipated ceasefire, a Palestinian survey released found overwhelming support for him to succeed Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The survey, conducted by the Ramallah-based Arab World for Research and Development (AWRAD), is the first since Hamas’s Gaza strongman and mastermind of the October 7 attacks Yahya Sinwar was killed in a chance encounter with soldiers in Rafah in October. As recently reported by The Press of Service of Israel, Barghouti’s family and lawyers have been in Qatar engaging in negotiations over his potential release and deportation to Turkey, along with other senior terrorists. Senior Fatah officials told TPS-IL that Barghouti’s wife, Fadwa, and son Qassam have consented to the arrangement. AWRAD’s survey of 704 Palestinians in Judea, Samaria and Gaza found Barghouti was the most popular figure to succeed Abbas. In a three-way race between Barghouti, his cousin, independent Mustafa Barghouti, and former Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal, Marwan Barghouti garnered the highest support with 45%, followed by Mustafa Barghouti at 22%, and Mashaal at 10%. The remaining 23% of respondents indicated they would vote for other candidates or abstained from answering. TPS-IL has learned that Egypt and Qatar support Hamas’s demand to release Barghouti because they want to pave the way for him to succeed Mahmoud Abbas as leader of the Palestinian Authority. Both countries fear that without a clear plan of succession, the PA will collapse after Abbas, who is 89. Israel is not likely to agree to Barghouti returning to Judea and Samaria under any circumstances. Barghouti, 65, is the highest profile Palestinian imprisoned in Israel. During the Second Intifada, he led the Tanzim militia, which was made up of various Fatah-associated terror groups. Foremost among these groups was the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, which Barghouti directly commanded and which carried out numerous suicide bombings and shooting attacks. A civilian court in 2004 convicted Barghouti for his role in the murder of a Greek Orthodox monk, a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv that killed three, and a shooting attack that killed one. Barghouti was also convicted of attempted murder for an attack in which a suicide bomber’s explosive detonated prematurely at a Jerusalem mall. He is currently serving five life sentences in an Israeli prison for his role in three terror attacks that killed five Israelis during the Second Intifada. The AWRAD survey also found 71% of Palestinians were dissatisfied with the leadership of PA President Mahmoud Abbas. Reasons included not providing a vision for the postcrisis period (76%), limited communication with the public (77%) and dissatisfaction with his approach to governance (73%) Palestinians have not held national elections since 2005 and Abbas is now in the 19th year of what was supposed to be a four-year term. Since then, Abbas has cancelled several attempted elections amid Fatah-Hamas disagreements, most recently in 2021.

Stroke survivors’ cognitive skills could unlock better recovery p...	Tasks that require adaptability, self-monitoring, and responsiveness — skills integral to rehabilitation — become significantly harder for stroke survivors. By Pesach Benson, TPS Although it is known that cognitive impairments impact stroke survivors, an Israeli study released on Wednesday specifically identifies the ability to understand and follow instructions as a foundational element for motor recovery and rehabilitation success. The findings are expected to lead to more personalized treatment and integration of technology into rehabilitation. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or significantly reduced, depriving brain cells of oxygen and nutrients, usually the result of a clot or bleeding. This can result in the death of brain cells within minutes, leading to potentially severe and lasting physical and cognitive damage. According to the World Stroke Organization, in 2019, there were approximately 12.2 million new stroke cases globally, while 101 million survivors were living with the aftermath of one. A team of researchers from the Joint Laboratory for Neurological Rehabilitation Research at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and the Negev Nahalat Eran Hospital uncovered new insights into the interplay between cognitive impairments and motor recovery after a stroke. The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, Neuropsychology. Dr. Reut Binyamin-Netzer and Prof. Lior Shmuelof from Ben-Gurion University’s Department of Cognitive and Brain Sciences led the study, which sought to understand how stroke affects the ability to follow instructions and identify the cognitive skills that underpin this capability. They focused on the cognitive processes that enable patients to learn and execute therapeutic tasks. According to the study, cognitive impairments — such as memory deficits, attention problems, and reduced executive function — affect 72% of stroke survivors. These challenges not only impair daily functioning but also hinder participation in rehabilitation programs. One particularly troubling consequence of cognitive impairment is the difficulty in learning and following instructions. Tasks that require adaptability, self-monitoring, and responsiveness — skills integral to rehabilitation — become significantly harder for stroke survivors. Recognizing the importance of these abilities, the researchers focused their investigation on the link between cognitive deficits and motor recovery. The study involved 31 stroke survivors and 36 age-matched control participants aged 55-75. All participants completed a series of computerized tasks designed to evaluate their ability to respond to stimuli based on color and location, as well as their capacity for delayed response and symbol-based information processing. The results revealed a notable decline in accuracy and reaction times among stroke survivors compared to the control group. Additionally, the stroke group exhibited slower information processing and reduced ability to delay responses. Importantly, the researchers found a direct correlation between the ability to delay a response and the capacity to follow instructions. 'The ability to delay a response has a significant impact on patients’ participation in the rehabilitation process,' explained Binyamin-Netzer. 'Understanding instructions is fundamental to motor recovery because rehabilitation relies on following structured tasks.' The researchers advocate for early, intensive rehabilitation programs that leverage computerized technologies to enhance recovery. These interventions should focus on improving cognitive abilities, which are intricately linked to motor recovery. Said Shmuelof, 'In an era where video games and other technologies are central to rehabilitation, understanding the connection between cognitive functions and recovery is critical.'

Bracing for Israeli retaliation, Houthis raise combat readiness a...	The Houthis have ordered the evacuation of civilians from areas close to the major coastal city of Hodeidah and have called troops to the front lines. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Wednesday, the Houthis raised the combat readiness for Yemen to its highest level in anticipation of Israeli retaliation, Saudi media reports. They have ordered the evacuation of civilians from areas close to the major coastal city of Hodeidah and have called troops to the front lines. Ashraq Al-Aswat reports that after the Israeli Defense Minister threatened to execute their leadership in a similar way to the killings of Hamas and Hezbollah leadership, the Houthis called up many new recruits. Other soldiers were moved to Yemen's cities to prevent an uprising similar to what occurred in Syria with the fall of the Assad regime. Merchants who own warehouses in the 'Kilo 7' district in Hodeidah were told to empty their facilities and prepare for the destruction of their property. Yemeni government officials said the Houthis had reinforced trenches, minefields, and earthen berms along the frontlines. The terror group warned civilians to avoid discussing attacks over the phone or by text and to be content with simply checking on the well-being of their relatives. Israel's defense minister signaled on Tuesday that the IDF is preparing for a major retaliation against pro-Iranian forces in Yemen after a string of missile attacks on Israel. Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) visited a Hetz (Arrow) missile defense battery Tuesday morning, accompanied by air defense commander Brig. Gen. Gilad Biran. The visit came hours after the missile battery successfully shot down a missile fired by Yemenite Houthis toward central Israel overnight. Katz said that Israel 'will not tolerate' continued attacks from pro-Iranian forces in Yemen and intimated that the IDF is preparing to assassinate Houthi leaders. 'We will not tolerate the fact that the Houthis continue to fire at the State of Israel. I warned and said that just as we dealt with Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran, and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will also deal with the Houthi leaders in Sana'a and everywhere in Yemen,' Katz said. Shrapnel from a Houthi missile shot down the IDF and damaged a home in central Israel early on Wednesday. Sirens sent millions to shelters, but there were no injuries.

Foreign investment in Israel surged in 2024, despite conflict	U.S. investors dominated the market, contributing $24 billion, representing 73% of total foreign investments. By JNS Preliminary numbers for the first half of 2024 show a 15% increase in foreign investment in Israel, according to the annual report of the Chief Economist’s Office of Israel’s Finance Ministry, published on Tuesday. With the exception of a major investment by Intel, 2023 saw a 24% decline in foreign investment in Israeli hi-tech compared to the previous year, the report states, according to Israel’s Globes business daily. Only 1,563 deals were concluded in 2023, compared to 2,502 in 2022—a drop of 62%. Key investments included Thales SA’s $3.6 billion Imperva merger and Adani Group’s $1.2 billion Haifa Port acquisition. Semiconductor investments led sectoral distribution at 48%, followed by IT at 31% and life sciences at 6%. U.S. investors dominated the market, contributing $24 billion, representing 73% of total foreign investments. hi-tech French investments reached $3.7 billion, taking the second-place position. By contrast, preliminary 2024 data shows first-half investment volumes of $11.8 billion across 910 deals. First-quarter investments totaled $4.4 billion with 460 deals, while second-quarter figures reached $7.4 billion with 450 deals. In October 2024 alone, the hi-tech sector brought in more than $1 billion in foreign investments. 'The global trend of a slowdown in foreign investment flows in 2023 also affected Israel. Investment volumes in Israel in 2023 were bolstered by Intel’s significant investment deal, while the country faced challenges, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to the ‘Iron Swords’ conflict,' said Finance Ministry Chief Economist Shmuel Abramzon, according to Globes. 'Data for 2024 indicates a growth trend in foreign investment deals in Israel, and improved security and political stability are expected to support this trend further,' he added. However, not all signs point to improvement. The year-long war with Lebanon’s Hezbollah terrorist organization devastated Israel’s north, which will cost the country more than 5 billion shekels ($1.4 billion) to repair. The damage from Iran’s missile attack on Israel on Oct. 1 alone will cost an estimated $40 million to repair. In addition, the Finance Ministry in October significantly reduced growth projections for the coming year due to the ongoing conflict, causing it to make more than $10 billion in budget cuts while aiming to limit the deficit to just 4% of GDP. An additional step the ministry has taken to right the ship and lower the deficit from its current 8.1% of GDP to its target goal of 4% was to raise VAT to 18% beginning on Jan. 1, 2025. This increase is expected to cost Israeli families between 1,000 to 2,000 shekels ($274 to $548) annually.

ADL applauds NY Governor Hochul for signing new social media tran...	The new law forces major social media companies to be more transparent about their current policies on topics such as hate speech, disinformation, extremism, and racism, and will hold the companies accountable for hate content on their platforms. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) expressed gratitude to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for signing into law on Tuesday legislation that will help combat hate speech on major social media platforms and ensure a safer social media experience for all users. Legislation S895B/A6789B, also known as the 'Stop Hiding Hate Act,' requires social media companies to inform all users of its terms of service. It also requires social media companies to submit reports about their terms of service and content moderation policies to the New York State Attorney General for inspection, and provides solutions for violations. The new law forces major social media companies to be more transparent about their current policies on topics such as hate speech, disinformation, extremism, and racism, and will hold the companies accountable for hate content on their platforms. New York State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D, WFP-Manhattan) penned the 'Stop Hiding Act' in partnership with Assembly Member Grace Lee (D-Manhattan) and the ADL. Together they have been advocating for its passage for years, according to the anti-hate organization. 'Today represents the culmination of the hard work of Senator Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Lee and tireless advocacy from community organizations and constituents across New York who support this measure for greater internet transparency and safety,' Scott Richman, the regional director of ADL New York/New Jersey, said in a released statement. 'We know there is still work to be done to protect vulnerable communities from hate and extremism online, but we commend Governor Hochul for taking this important step in creating a safer internet for all New Yorkers.' Hoylman-Sigal said in a released statement that the new law 'will help boost accountability and transparency for social media companies who currently face far too little regulation, and create a safer social media environment for all.' 'With white supremacy, antisemitism, islamophobia, anti-LGBTQ hatred and anti-AAPI violence all on the rise, social media companies must ensure that their platforms don’t advance disinformation and hate-fueled violence,' he added. 'The current social media landscape makes it too easy for bad actors to promote false claims, hate and dangerous conspiracies, too often leading to violence like January 6 and the rise in antisemitism and islamophobia we have seen in the aftermath of the October 7th terrorist attacks in Israel.' Lee noted that New York is only the second state in the US, after California, to sign into law a social media transparency bill that holds such companies accountable for their moderation policies and hate speech on their platform. 'Social media companies have created an environment where hate and disinformation spread like wildfire,' Lee explained. 'Algorithms that prioritize the most attention-grabbing posts often amplify hateful language, giving it a massive platform. These companies have a responsibility to protect users from this hate, but have failed to do so. The ‘Stop Hiding Hate Act’ ensures greater accountability and transparency on social media, requiring companies to clearly outline the steps they are taking to eliminate hate on their platforms. It will provide critical protections for all users online and hold these platforms accountable to the public.' The 'Stop Hiding Act' was part of a legislative bill package that Governor Kathy Hochul signed on Tuesday. 'With this legislative package, we are taking bold action to hold companies accountable, strengthen protections, and give consumers the transparency and security they need and deserve,' the governor said in a released statement.

Hamas, Netanyahu trade blame as hostage deal hits roadblock	Hamas accuses Israel of issuing new demands in hostage deal talks; Netanyahu accuses the terror group of lying and 'reneging on understandings already reached.' By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Hamas terror organization traded blame Wednesday afternoon after hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar appeared to stall, amid reports that Hamas continues to withhold information regarding the condition of the roughly 100 captives held in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli negotiating team returned home following days of talks in Doha, ending the latest round of brokered negotiations. A senior official cited by Israel Hayom said Hamas was to blame for the breakdown in talks, accusing the terror group of toughening its position, after having appeared to soften it earlier this month. 'Hamas is effectively backing down from the softening that led to the renewal of the talks, and is once again demanding an Israeli commitment to end the war at the end of the comprehensive deal as a condition for implementing its first phase.' On Wednesday, Hamas issued a statement claimed that the negotiations were 'proceeding seriously' and that the group was showing 'responsibility and flexibility.' Hamas accused Israel's delegation of issuing new demands 'and conditions related to the withdrawal' of Israeli forces during a three-phase ceasefire, as well as the freeing of 'prisoners and the return of the displaced,' referring to Hamas calls to expand access to the northern Gaza Strip. Israel's alleged new demands 'delayed reaching the agreement that was available,' Hamas continued. Shortly afterwards, Netanyahu's office responded with a statement rejected Hamas' claims, accusing the terror group of lying and 'reneging' on tentative agreements reached during talks, blaming the Gaza-based organization for the apparent deadlock in negotiations. 'The Hamas terrorist organization continues to lie, is reneging on understandings that have already been reached, and is continuing to create difficulties in the negotiations,' the statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office reads. 'However, Israel will continue its relentless efforts to return all of our hostages.'

UN Security Council calls emergency session on Houthi attacks on ...	After two consecutive nights of missile attacks by Yemenite Houthis, United Nations Security Council agrees to Israel's request for an emergency session. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The United Nations Security Council agreed Wednesday to hold an emergency session next week, following multiple missile attacks by Yemenite Houthis on Israel. Israel's mission to the United Nations, headed by Ambassador Danny Danon, requested the session after pre-dawn missile attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthis on central Israel two days in a row. 'The Houthis appear not to have grasped the consequences that await those who attempt to attack Israel,' Danon said Wednesday. 'The Security Council must stand with Israel and condemn these attacks. I urge the council to uphold international law and establish Iran's accountability in this matter.' The emergency Security Council session is slated to be held next Monday. Before dawn Wednesday morning, a missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by Israel's missile defense system, leading to warning sirens sounding across hundreds of towns across central Israel due to possible shrapnel damage. A day earlier, a similar attack took place, with the missile intercepted en route to central Israel. On Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz hinted that the IDF may soon target Houthi leaders in Yemen. 'We will not tolerate the fact that the Houthis continue to fire at the State of Israel,' Katz said while visiting the missile battery which shot down the missile launched towards Israel early Tuesday morning. 'I warned and said that just as we dealt with Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran, and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will also deal with the Houthi leaders in Sana’a and everywhere in Yemen.' 'We will act both against their infrastructures and against them to remove the threat and eliminate the dangers to the State of Israel in order to achieve our goals. Whoever supports Houthi terrorism in Hudaydah or Sana’a will pay the full price,' he continued.

5 wounded in clashes between IDF and Syrians in Golan Heights buf...	Syrian monitor group says IDF demanding villages in Golan Heights buffer zone surrender their weapons to prevent their seizure by Islamist rebel group now leading provisional government. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News At least five people were wounded Wednesday morning during clashes between Syrian protesters and IDF forces deployed to the demilitarized zone in the Golan Heights. Arab media outlets, including Saudi Arabia's Al-Hadath, reported that a group of Syrians living in the demilitarized zone clashed with Israeli forces during a protest against the presence of IDF troops in the Quneitra district. During the clashes, according to the report, Israeli soldiers opened fire, wounding five rioters. The incident occurred less than a day after the IDF demanded that the village leaders of Jubata al-Khashab, a small Sunni town in the DMZ less than a mile from the Israeli border, surrender all weapons stored in the village. 'They [the Israelis] told us that they have information regarding light and heavy weapons in our village,' residents said in a video released Tuesday. 'They said we have 48 hour to hand over the weapons to them. So our response is this: We have a [provisional] government, and if we have any weapons that need to be handed over, we'll give it to them.' 'They [the Israelis] told us that they are here in order to prevent ISIS soldiers or the [Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham] from entering the area, and that the are the relevant authority in the area over any weapons here.' Following the collapse of the Assad regime on December 8th, Israeli forces occupied the 100-square-mile buffer zone that separates the Israeli Golan Heights from the Syrian frontier. Established in 1974 following the Yom Kippur War, the buffer zone was carved out of the roughly 200 square miles which fell under Syrian control under the disengagement of forces agreement. Israel retained the remaining 500 square miles of the Golan, which it annexed in 1981.

American hostages must be freed first in any deal, say ex-Biden, ...	Hamas and their backers must hear the message loud and clear,' Democrat Tom Nides and Republican Robert O’Brien wrote in an op-ed. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News All seven U.S. hostages must be freed in the first stage of any deal with Hamas, two former top American officials wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal Monday. In a bipartisan move, Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, and President Joe Biden’s first ambassador to Israel, Tom Nides, demanded 'the immediate release' of both the dead and living Americans being held in the Gaza Strip. 'The US has many strategic interests in the Middle East,' they wrote. 'We, like the presidents we served, don’t always agree on how to serve them&#8230;. But we are united in our belief that the seven US hostages still in Gaza, along with the other 93 hostages, must come home now.' Of the dozen Americans Hamas and other terror groups kidnapped among 251 people, including some they murdered during the invasion and massacre of 1,200 in southern Israel last October 7, five were either released alive or their bodies were recovered by IDF forces. O'Brien and Nides listed the 'American Seven,' as they called them, who were left, asking that people 'remember them at your holiday celebrations this week,' without differentiating between the dead and living. Three Americans of the hundred remaining in captivity, civilians Keith Siegal, 65, and Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, and lone soldier Edan Alexander, 20, are assumed to still be alive. Wednesday is Christmas day and the eight-day, Jewish holiday of Hanukkah will begin Wednesday evening. First addressing 'all parties' to the negotiations, the two stated, 'They aren’t a bargaining chip. They are our fellow citizens with names and family members who await them with unbearable pain.' They then turned specifically to the abductors, blasting the terror organization for using the hostages as human shields and writing, 'Hamas and their backers must hear the message loud and clear: Release the Americans in the first phase of the deal. All of them.' 'President Biden and his team have been working hard to make this happen. President-elect Trump has made clear that the American Seven must be released before he returns to office or there will be ‘hell to pay,’' they added. Hamas should learn from this that all Americans are united on this demand and that 'for the US government, bringing home our citizens who have been unlawfully detained is a high priority rooted deep in our history,' they stated. Wednesday marked the 444th day of captivity for the one hundred remaining Hamas hostages, over a third of whom are dead, thereby surpassing the amount of time American embassy staffers were held in Iranian captivity after the Islamic Revolution toppled the Shah’s regime in 1979.

Hamas not handing over list of living hostages – report	The Gaza terror group is reportedly reversing course after appearing to soften its position in hostage deal talks with Israel, and is now refusing to disclose to Israel which hostages are still alive. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization has yet to disclose to Israel which of the roughly 100 remaining captives held in the Gaza Strip are still alive, according to reports in Hebrew media outlets Wednesday. The Islamist group had indicated earlier this month its willingness to compromise on key issues which had prevented previous efforts to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. As part of the renewed talks between Israel and Hamas, brokered by Egypt and Qatar, Hamas reportedly agreed to hand over a list of the remaining Israeli captives and details regarding their condition. Dozens of the nearly 100 remaining hostages have been confirmed by Israeli intelligence to be dead, with some information gathered by Israel indicating that as few as 50 captives are still alive. Now, according to reporting by Kan, Israel's public broadcaster, and the Israel Hayom newspaper claim that Hamas is refusing to inform Israel which hostages are still alive. 'Hamas is effectively backing down from the softening that led to the renewal of the talks, and is once again demanding an Israeli commitment to end the war at the end of the comprehensive deal as a condition for implementing its first phase,' a senior official told Israel Hayom. Israeli negotiators left Qatar after several days of talks, and have returned home for 'internal deliberations.' The deal currently under consideration would include a three-phase ceasefire and hostage release, with Israel gradually withdrawing from most of the Gaza Strip, while Hamas frees Israeli captives in exchange for the release of hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists. During the first stage, five female soldiers would be released, along with elderly captives, children, and seriously ill hostages.

Two-thirds of Palestinians want Hamas in new Gaza government, sur...	17% of the surveyed Palestinians told AWRAD they favor a return to the situation in which Gaza is ruled solely by Hamas terrorists. By JNS Close to two-thirds of Palestinians in Gaza, Judea and Samaria prefer for Hamas terrorists to be part of, or even lead, a Palestinian governing body that would control the Strip after the current war with Israel concludes, according to a new Arab opinion poll published over the weekend. The Ramallah-based Arab World for Research and Development (AWRAD) polling firm surveyed 704 Palestinian adults between Nov. 27 and Dec. 2. (The margin of error is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points, AWRAD said.) According to the poll, 47% of Palestinians say they would put their trust in a government of 'national unity' that would include Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah faction, which currently governs swaths of Judea and Samaria, as well as Hamas, the terror group that ruled Gaza until it was destroyed by the Israel Defense Forces in recent months. Meanwhile, 17% of the surveyed Palestinians told AWRAD they favor a return to the situation in which Gaza is ruled solely by Hamas terrorists. In Judea and Samaria, respondents showed significantly more support for Hamas than for the Western-backed P.A., with 25% expressing support for the Islamist terrorist organization, compared to just 10% for the P.A. Hamas led the bloody terror attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, during which 1,200 people were murdered, thousands more were wounded and over 250 innocents were taken as hostages to the Strip. Asked about possible P.A. presidential candidates if Ramallah would call its first vote in almost 19 years, Marwan Barghouti, a convicted terrorist murderer affiliated with Fatah serving multiple life sentences in Israel, received the most support of all possible candidates for P.A. chief. In June, the Palestinians’ satisfaction with Hamas’s performance in the war against Israel reached its highest point since the Oct. 7 massacre, while support for the Palestinian Authority and Fatah plummeted. When asked by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research to rate the performance of various actors during the war, Hamas took the lead with 75% satisfaction, up five percentage points since March. The June 12 opinion poll recorded a slight drop in support for the Hamas-led massacre. Two-thirds declared Hamas was 'correct' in launching the attack, down by four percentage points compared to three months prior. Fifty-one percent said they believed that Hamas is 'the most deserving' of leading the Palestinian people, up from 49% in March. Meanwhile, 16% of Palestinian Arabs believed Abbas’s Fatah was the most deserving. Almost 60% of Palestinians said they saw the 'return of Hamas' in Gaza as the preferred outcome for the conflict, followed by 25% that preferred a 'new P.A. under an elected president, parliament and government.' The Biden administration wants the P.A. to assume control of Gaza after the completion of Israel’s military operation against Hamas. Jerusalem vehemently rejects that due to Ramallah’s overt support for terrorism. The U.S. State Department in December 2023 refused to rule out the possibility of Hamas terrorists retaining power or joining a Palestinian Authority-led governing body for the Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria. 'Palestinians’ voices and aspirations must be at the center of post-crisis governance in Gaza, unified with the West Bank under the P.A.,' a U.S. government spokesperson told JNS, adding, 'Ultimately, the future of Palestinian leadership is a question for the Palestinian people.'

Windward sails into new waters with $270M acquisition by US inves...	The acquisition report highlighted FTV’s plan to accelerate Windward’s growth by expanding beyond maritime operations into global supply chain analytics. By Pesach Benson, TPS Windward, a Tel Aviv-based maritime analytics company, will be acquired by Octopus UK Bidco Ltd for approximately one billion shekels ($270 million), the companies announced on Wednesday. The London-based Octopus belongs to the San Francisco growth equity firm FTV Management Co LP. Founded in 2010, Windward uses artificial intelligence to assess maritime risks in real time. Clients include government agencies and energy companies, among others. 'This marks an exciting next step in the evolution of Windward, providing the opportunity to build upon our first mover advantage in maritime generative AI through accelerated innovation and greater market reach. We are incredibly proud of the growth we have achieved while on the AIM market, and our ability to adapt and incorporate evolving technology, specifically generative AI,' said Windward CEO and founder Ami Daniel. The acquisition report highlighted FTV’s plan to accelerate Windward’s growth by expanding beyond maritime operations into global supply chain analytics. 'As global seaborne trade expands, regulatory regimes tighten and supply chain pressures mount, the need for advanced maritime intelligence and visibility has become imperative for global organizations to effectively operate and manage risk in an increasingly complex landscape,' said FTV managing partner Brad Bernstein. 'Windward has built a best-in-class maritime AI-based analytics platform spanning use cases across risk, compliance, trading and the supply chain and delivering tangible value to its growing blue-chip customer base worldwide,' Bernstein added. According to Windward, which is publicly traded in London, the £216 million ($270 million) cash deal offers a 47% premium on Tuesday’s share price and a 92% premium on the six-month average. Since its IPO, Windward has tripled its customer base. Independent directors believe in its ability to thrive independently but acknowledge economic, regulatory, and competitive challenges. They said they considered the offer attractive, providing strong capital access to support expansion and effectively navigate uncertainties. Windward reported revenue of $17.6 million in the first half of 2024, – a 37% increase compared to the first half of the previous year.

AOC compares Israel-Hamas war to Vietnam, says conflict has been ...	AOC also labeled the Israel-Hamas war a 'genocide' and argued that the Democratic Party needs to undermine Israel’s defense efforts if it aims to energize young voters and 'reinstate an order around human rights.' By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner During an interview on left-wing internet talk show The Majority Report, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) agreed that the ongoing conflict in Gaza is comparable to the Vietnam War, arguing that America’s strident support of Israel has radicalized younger Americans. While interviewing AOC, The Majority Report host Sam Seder argued that the Israel-Hamas war is 'akin' to the Vietnam War. Seder suggested that 'alternative media' such as TikTok, YouTube, or podcasts, have presented a harshly critical view of Israel’s conduct in Gaza, resulting in a wide-scale radicalization of young people against the Jewish state. 'If you’re under the age of 40 what’s gone on in Israel is in Palestine and Gaza in particular obviously and the West Bank for that matter is very different from your perception if you’re over the age of 40 because of where you get your media,' Seder said. AOC agreed, saying that she has 'said this directly to Democratic leadership' and ' communicated this to the White House.' 'This is our Vietnam. This is our, not just like in terms of the party, but this is just our country’s Vietnam. And what I think a lot of people do not yet understand, is they think that some of these hemorrhages are maybe ideological. They think maybe it is like an ethnic thing. I don’t think there is appreciation yet about how generationally radicalizing yeah this moment is, and how shocked people are at how far just like the general inertia is willing to go, as if we’re not seeing what’s happening right before our very eyes.' AOC continued, labelling the Israel-Hamas war a 'genocide' and arguing that the Democratic party needs to undermine Israel’s defense efforts if it aims to energize young voters and 'reinstate an order around human rights.' Israel says it has gone to unprecedented lengths to try and avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, noting its efforts to evacuate areas before it targets them and to warn residents of impending military operations with leaflets, text messages, and other forms of communication. However, Hamas, which rules Gaza, has in many cases prevented people from leaving, according to the Israeli military. Another challenge for Israel has been Hamas’s widely recognized military strategy of embedding its terrorists within Gaza’s civilian population and commandeering civilian facilities like hospitals, schools, and mosques to run operations and direct attacks. Over the past year, AOC has repeatedly condemned the Jewish state’s response to the Hamas terrorist group’s brutal Oct. 7 slaughter of roughly 1200 people throughout southern Israel. AOC, a strident critic of Israel, has accused the Jewish state of committing a 'genocide' and 'ethnic cleansing' in Gaza. She has spearheaded calls for a 'ceasefire' between Israel and Hamas. The progressive firebrand has also urged the Biden administration to implement an 'arms embargo' against Israel.

US blasts claims of north Gaza famine as ‘inaccurate, irresponsib...	American Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew blasts US government agency's report warning of a likely famine in the northern Gaza Strip, deriding its reliance on outdated, inaccurate information. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration's top envoy to Israel rebutted claims by an American government agency alleging that a famine is likely taking place in the northern Gaza Strip. On Monday, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) published a report warning of a likely famine in the northern Gaza Strip, specifically impacting the cities of Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun. 'Israel’s near-total blockade of humanitarian and commercial food supplies to besieged areas of North Gaza Governorate&#8230; has been in place for nearly 80 days,' the report said. 'Based on the collapse of the food system&#8230; it is highly likely that the food consumption and acute malnutrition thresholds for Famine (IPC Phase 5) have now been surpassed in North Gaza Governorate.' 'In the absence of a change to Israeli policy on the entry of food and nutrition supplies to this area, FEWS NET expects non-trauma mortality levels will pass the Famine (IPC Phase 5) threshold between January and March 2025, with at least 2-15 people dying per day.' The report was based on an analysis of aid transfers to the northern Gaza Strip since November, compared with estimates of the number of Gazans currently residing in the area. The FEWS NET analysis relied on a mid-November estimate of a northern Gaza population of between 65,000 to 75,000 people for its calculations. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network is a U.S. government program operated by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). On Tuesday, however, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew issued a statement rebutting and condemning the FEWS NET report, noting that it had relied on 'outdated and inaccurate' figures. 'The report issued today on Gaza by FEWS NET relies on data that is outdated and inaccurate,' Lew said. 'We have worked closely with the Government of Israel and the UN to provide greater access to the North Governorate, and it is now apparent that the civilian population in that part of Gaza is in the range of 7,000-15,000, not 65,000-75,000 which is the basis of this report.' The Israeli Defense Ministry, Lew noted, 'estimates the population in this area is between 5,000 and 9,000.' 'UNRWA estimates the population is between 10,000 and 15,000.' 'At a time when inaccurate information is causing confusion and accusations, it is irresponsible to issue a report like this.

What Israel has just accomplished in Syria	By Hugh Fitzgerald, Frontpage Magazine While launching nearly 500 airstrikes on Syrian military assets, including missile warehouses, three military airbases housing fighter aircraft and helicopters, storehouses of chemical weapons and chemical weapons production plants, air-defense systems, weapons stockpiles, and the entire Syrian navy, the IDF has also taken over the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, and the summit of Mount Hermon, which gives the Israelis an uninterrupted sightline to the capital Damascus. More on what Israel has done to make sure, in just three days, to ensure that jihadists in Syria cannot threaten the Jewish state, can be found here. Unsurprisingly, Israel was quick to destroy both Assad’s chemical weapons plants and his stores of chemical weapons, relieving the world of the worry that they might be used not only against Israel and against the Syrian people, but also against Western countries, should they fall into the hands of ISIS. Even before the Biden administration announced that it would work with 'partners in the area' to destroy 'chemical weapons,' the IDF was already completing that task. That was their first target, on Sunday, Dec. 8. A day later, the IDF destroyed the Assad regime’s storage sites housing long-range missiles, both surface-to-surface and air-to-surface, and its weapons research facilities, and hit Syria’s three main military airbases, destroying many dozens of fighter jets and helicopters. It also hit weapons production and research facilities. In sum, these were the results of IAF attacks from Saturday to early Monday: the destruction of all chemical weapons stores and production plants, weapons research offices, missile storehouses and manufacturing plants. By Tuesday, the IAF had hit a total of 310 targets, which included the military airbases at Homs, Qamishli and Damascus, as well as weapons depots and other strategic military sites. On Tuesday morning, the IAF destroyed Syria’s navy at Latakia. Now Syria is essentially without either an air force or a navy; both have been blown to smithereens. The IDF estimates that, as of early on Tuesday, some 70%-80% of the capabilities of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s military have been destroyed. The Israelis, of course, have made themselves, and everyone else threatened by Islamic jihadists, safer by destroying these weapons that could, at some future time, fall into the hands of ISIS and similar groups. The Israelis cannot bet their security on the possibility that Mohamed al-Jolani is in truth a moderate as he now claims to be, or other members of the Hayat Tahrir al-Shams jihad group are similarly moderate. And even if al-Jolani has had a change of heart on the road to Damascus, and is no longer the jihadist he has been all his adult life — which is most doubtful — what will happen in the future? Who in the end will hold power? Israel cannot assume that ISIS, which has a continuing presence in eastern Syria, would not succeed in seizing some of the weapons left behind by Assad’s disintegrating forces and use them against Israel. n the chaos and confusion, the IDF acted sensibly to remove as much of the potential threat from Syria as it possibly could. Israel cannot take chances with the jihadist threat from Syria, a country that has been at war with Israel ever since 1948. The IDF had to take advantage of this unparalleled and unrepeatable opportunity, with the Syrian military disbanded, and weapons lying unattended all over the country, to destroy as many of Syria’s military assets as it could. And so it has done, surpassing all expectations, by destroying 70-80% of those assets. One commentator summed up the three days of airstrikes thus: those 72 hours 'stood out even for people who thought they had already seen everything.' And the result was that the Israeli Air Force, according to defense journalist Yoav Limor, 'didn’t strip the Syrian military of specific capabilities only – it sent it back to the starting line, bereft of any significant strategic capabilities.' As a result, Israel, and the world, are much safer.

Iran: Ballistic missile attack was ‘self-defense’ after Haniyeh k...	Iran calls Israel's killing of Hamas head Ismail Haniyeh a 'heinous crime,' says it justifies October missile barrage. By World Israel News Staff The Iranian ambassador to the United Nations said that Tehran's October ballistic missile barrage targeting Israel was an act of 'legitimate self-defense,' following the assassination of Hamas politburo head Ismail Haniyeh. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Israel Katz revealed that Israel was behind the July slaying of Haniyeh at a Tehran guesthouse, which marked the first time that Jerusalem formally accepted responsibility for the killing. Katz said that Israel would eliminate the senior leadership of the Houthis, just as it had killed Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Haniyeh. Shortly after Katz's statement, the Iranian mission to the UN released a lengthy statement on X, referring to the assassination as a 'heinous crime.' In a shameless admission, the regime’s Minister of Warmongering confessed to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader and former Prime Minister of Palestine, during his visit to Tehran. This brazen act underscores Israel’s role in terrorism, legitimizes Iran’s… pic.twitter.com/hBgPpYoMi7 &mdash; I.R.IRAN Mission to UN, NY (@Iran_UN) December 24, 2024 The letter, addressing UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Security Council President Linda Thomas-Greenfield, demanded that the international organization condemn Israel for the slaying of Haniyeh. Accepting responsibility for Haniyeh's slaying underscores 'Israel’s role in terrorism, legitimizes Iran’s response on 1 October 2024, and reaffirms the Zionist regime as a serious threat to global peace, which must be stopped,' the Iranian mission wrote. Israel is now 'desperately attempting to justify and legitimize its&#8230;acts of aggression against Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity,' the statement claimed. Notably, there was no mention of the Yemen-based Houthi's repeated ballistic missile attacks on Israel, nor the fact that the Houthis are funded and directed by Iran. Iran's launch of hundreds of ballistic missiles towards Israel, which sent virtually all of the Jewish State's nine million residents into bomb shelters, was a 'legitimate and legal, defensive response' to the assassination, they charged. No Israelis were hurt in the attack, though several air bases sustained serious damage. A Gazan man living in the Palestinian Authority-controlled city of Jericho was killed by a large piece of shrapnel, which fell directly on top of him as he walked on the street.

Houthi missile damages home, 9 injured running to shelters	If we hadn't entered the bomb shelter, it could have ended in disaster,' says woman whose family home was damaged by a ballistic missile fragment. By World Israel News Staff Shrapnel from a Houthi-launched ballistic missile shot down by the Israeli Air Force early Wednesday morning damaged a house in central Israel, with the overnight attack sending millions of Israelis into bomb shelters. Sirens wailed across multiple regions of Israel, including the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, the Jerusalem suburb of Beit Shemesh, and at Ben-Gurion Airport. Activity at the airport was suspended for approximately thirty minutes following the sirens, but has since returned to normal operations. Magen David Adom paramedics treated nine people who were injured while running to bomb shelters, following the sirens sounding at 4:20 a.m. Initially, the military claimed that the missile had been intercepted outside of Israeli airspace, but pieces of debris from the interception and the missile itself were reportedly found in at least three different areas within the Jewish state. Large pieces of shrapnel landed in the front yard of the Steinberg-Golan family, who live in Be'er Yaakov, a suburb of Israel's fourth largest city, Rishon LeZion. Speaking to Hebrew-language outlet Walla, Shira Steinberg-Golan said that she was shocked to discover 'a missile fragment as tall as me' in her backyard. An external air conditioning unit had been blown off the side of the house, with half of the tiling on the patio smashed from the impact. 'If we hadn't entered the bomb shelter, it could have ended in disaster,' she said. Meital Merhav, an American cousin visiting the family, told Walla that she had only arrived in Israel from New York five days ago. In that time, she has already heard three air raid sirens. 'It's a shock, the whole thing with sirens is new to me. Luckily I slept in the bomb shelter,' Merhav said. 'The family is okay, we couldn't believe it struck here in the yard. No one could imagine that anything like this could happen,' she added. 'We went outside, opened the door and saw that the missile fragment was here. Luckily it only ended with property damage. It's a traumatic experience, but [we're] glad everyone is okay.'

Investigation reveals IDF did not know 6 executed hostages were i...	One assessment concluded that the likelihood hostages were in the area was 'medium to low.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An internal IDF investigation into the recovery of the bodies of six executed hostages in August confirmed that the army was unaware of the proximity of the captives prior to their discovery. The bodies of Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and MSG Ori Danino were recovered by the army on August 31, 2024. The findings of the investigation were communicated by Chief of the General Staff, LTG Herzi Halevi, on Tuesday to the families of the hostages. According to the investigation's findings, the troops of the 162nd Division launched an operation to defeat Hamas's al-Tel Sultan Battalion following three months of fighting in Rafah. While they were fighting, they discovered additional tunnels. A dedicated command center was established, led by Shayetet 13 and the 162nd Division, to monitor the underground areas and to potentially locate hostages. The assessment concluded that the likelihood hostages were in the area was 'medium to low,' and yet they were instructed to operate with precaution. On August 27, hostage Qaid Farhan Alkadi was rescued without prior information or any indication that he was there. The IDF halted operations for 24 hours to assess the likelihood of additional hostages in the area and did not find any positive indication that there were. On August 31, 2024, the IDF found the bodies of the six executed hostages in an underground tunnel. According to a pathological report, the hostages were estimated to have died on August 29. It was only on the 30th that the IDF had discovered the shaft of the tunnel where the hostage's bodies were found after they had already been killed. The investigation also found that although the ground forces acted with the utmost care and caution, their operations could have been a motivating factor to the terrorists deciding to execute the hostages. 'The IDF shares the grief of the families over their grievous loss and will continue to accompany them. The IDF is continuing to operate with all means to fulfill the supreme national mission of bringing home all the hostages,' the military stated.

IDF raids terrorist-embedded hospital in northern Gaza	According to the military and Israel's security agency (Shin Bet), at least one of the eliminated terrorists had taken part in the October 7 massacre. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF eliminated five and arrested dozens more terrorists at the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza on Tuesday. According to the military and Israel's security force (Shin Bet), at least one of the eliminated terrorists had taken part in the October 7 massacre. The mission was carried out by the Givati ​​Brigade, under the command of Division 162, based on military intelligence. This is the first time since last December the IDF has eliminated terrorists at an Indonesian hospital. For the past month, terrorists had been attacking IDF troops from the facility using anti-tank missiles and had also planted booby traps surrounding the hospital. To prevent civilian casualties, the IDF warned and oversaw the evacuation of staff and patients from the hospital. The evacuation was coordinated by the IDF's Gaza District Coordination and Liaison Administration in coordination with local health officials through clearly defined evacuation routes using emergency vehicles to facilitate the removal of civilians from harm's way. The IDF said in a statement, 'The operation was carried out after several warnings were given to the Gaza Health Ministry about terrorist activities taking place within the hospital. The troops took steps to minimize harm to uninvolved civilians and made efforts to allow the hospital's operations to continue as much as possible.' The IDF said Hamas's continued use of hospitals to shield terrorists is 'a further example of how the Hamas terrorist organization systematically violates international law by exploiting civilian infrastructure and the Gazan population as human shields for its terrorist activities.' IDF Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said continued military operations will pressure Hamas to return the 100 hostages remaining in Gaza and create the optimal security situation to allow residents of border communities to return home. He made the situational assessment alongside senior commanders, including Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and Gaza Division Commander Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram. 'We are dismantling Hamas and targeting its infrastructure and forces to ensure that there will never be another October 7,' Halevi said. 'We are applying daily pressure on Hamas, driving it into greater distress, to secure the return of the 100 hostages—hopefully alive—and for those who are not, to give them a proper burial in Israel.' The IDF activities were also designed to ensure the safe return of Gaza border community residents. 'As residents return, our responsibility grows even greater—not smaller. It is our duty to establish a far stronger security framework, ensuring they can feel safe and secure here,' Halevy said.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israelis are signing up by the thousands to settle in a Golan Heights community named for former and President-elect Donald Trump, The New York Post reports. Although the community now only has 50 to 100 residents, there is currently a waiting list of over 2,000. 'Trump Heights is one of the biggest tourist sites in the region,' said Yaakov Selavan, deputy head of the regional council, to The Post. In June 2019, the Israeli cabinet under the Netanyahu government voted on a resolution to 'initiate the establishment of a new residential community on the Golan Heights to be named after U.S President Donald Trump.' The move was in recognition of the president's efforts on behalf of Israel, including recognizing Jerusalem as the country's capital as well as Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights. Five years later, the victory of Donald Trump in the 2024 election renewed interest in the community. Yarden Friman, Trump Heights' de facto mayor, said, 'Trump's recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights is something very dear to me and to all of us,' He added, 'And I'm optimistic about the future; we haven't had a single [air raid] alarm since the ceasefire with Hezbollah.' However, it isn't just the US President's popularity that has sparked interest among would-be residents; the drive to settle the Golan Heights has become a national security imperative for Israel, particularly after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated a goal of doubling the number of residents in the Golan Heights from the current 50,000. 'Strengthening the Golan Heights is strengthening the State of Israel, and it is especially important at this time,' Netanyahu said in a statement last week. 'We will continue to hold on to it, make it flourish, and settle it.' Yedidya Ostroff, 31, came to Trump Heights after evacuating from a community closer to the Lebanon border. Since then, Ostroff has been fixing up homes and constructing new houses in Trump Heights. Ostroff said, 'This is a really special community, really good people, and it's also a good mix of religious and non-religious people.'
