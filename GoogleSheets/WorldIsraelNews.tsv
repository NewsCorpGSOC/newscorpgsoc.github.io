Syria built clandestine atomic reactor, says Israeli nuclear chie...	In March, IAEA director Rafael Grossi visited Syria for talks with Syrian leaders about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s atomic chief warned that Syria has built an undeclared nuclear facility in remarks at the International Atomic Energy Agency’s conference in Vienna on Tuesday. 'Syria, which built an undeclared, clandestine nuclear reactor at Deir al-Zour, optimized for plutonium production, has been in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations for over a decade,' said Moshe Edri, Director General of Israel’s Atomic Energy Commission. 'Syria has recently followed the footsteps of its close ally, Iran, and is pretending to cooperate in good faith with the Agency, while not admitting the full facts, and not providing true answers to the Agency’s questions. The international community should stand behind the IAEA with a goal towards receiving clear, full, explanations from Syria, once and for all.' In March, IAEA director Rafael Grossi visited Syria for talks with Syrian leaders about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It was the first visit by an IAEA official to Syria since 2011 when international nuclear inspectors fled the country during the Syrian Civil War. Grossi’s visit sought to revive an investigation into a nuclear facility at Deir al-Zour destroyed in an Israeli airstrike in 2007. Israel did not confirm responsibility for the airstrike until 2018. Edri also called on the international community to take stronger measures against Iran’s nuclear program. 'Iran continues to be the main source of regional instability, and poses a threat to peace and security worldwide. This reality requires the full attention of the international community, now more than ever before. There is no doubt that Iran conducted a military nuclear program aimed to produce several nuclear weapon devices,' said Edri. An IAEA report in May concluded that Iran possesses a significant stockpile of uranium enriched to more than 60% purity, far higher than the 3.67% necessary for a civilian nuclear program. Nuclear weapons require uranium enriched to 90% purity. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in July that Iran’s breakout time to produce enough weapons-grade material for a nuclear weapon is 'probably one or two weeks.' Said Edri, 'Iran continues to advance this program by gaining relevant technology and knowledge, along with fissile material in alarming amounts. Iran has been conducting covert nuclear activities in undeclared sites for many years. The Agency has found concrete evidence of these activities, including the use of undeclared nuclear material and equipment. Despite repeated resolutions by the Board of Governors, Iran has continuously failed to provide technically credible explanations regarding these activities, and continues to deceive the Agency and the international community.' He added, 'Moreover, Iran continues to develop, test and deploy long-range ballistic missiles, and supports terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East, including the Houthi terrorist group that is a significant security threat to the freedom of navigation, and to the global trade routes. A nuclear-armed Iran, equipped with delivery systems, is not an option that Israel, or the world, can, or should tolerate.'

‘World cannot tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran,’ warns top nuclear o...	Director-General of Israel's nuclear commission warns Iran still evading IAEA scrutiny, using undeclared nuclear materials. By World Israel News Staff Israel's top nuclear official warned the International Atomic Energy Agency Tuesday not to permit Iran to acquire nuclear weapons, saying that complacency vis-a-vis a nuclear-armed Iran is 'not an option' for the world. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Director General Moshe Edri addressed the 68th International Atomic Energy (IAEA) General Conference in Vienna on Tuesday, and commented on the regional challenges facing the State of Israel, highlighting both Iran and Syria, both of which he accused of not honoring their international commitments in this field. Edri emphasized that Iran's nuclear program, which continues to evade full scrutiny by the IAEA, poses a threat not only to Israel but to global stability. 'Iran continues to be the main source of regional instability, and poses a threat to peace and security worldwide. This reality requires the full attention of the international community, now more than ever before.' 'There is no doubt that Iran conducted a military nuclear program aimed to produce several nuclear weapon devices. Iran continues to advance this program by gaining relevant technology and knowledge, along with fissile material in alarming amounts.' Edri noted that Tehran has thus far flouted IAEA requirements, operating secret nuclear facilities while refusing to provide an honest accounting of its nuclear activities. 'Iran has been conducting covert nuclear activities in undeclared sites for many years. The Agency has found concrete evidence of these activities, including the use of undeclared nuclear material and equipment.' 'Despite repeated resolutions by the Board of Governors, Iran has continuously failed to provide technically credible explanations regarding these activities, and continues to deceive the Agency and the international community.' Most egregiously, Edri added, the Iranian government continues to develop and produce ballistic missiles clearly intended to serve as delivery mechanisms for nuclear weapons. 'Moreover, Iran continues to develop, test and deploy long-range ballistic missiles, and supports terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East, including the Houthi terrorist group that is a significant security threat to the freedom of navigation, and to the global trade routes. A nuclear-armed Iran, equipped with delivery systems, is not an option that Israel, or the world, can, or should tolerate.'

Israel returns body of Allenby Crossing terrorist to Jordan	Israeli officials have not commented on the return of al-Jazi’s body. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel returned the body of a Jordanian national who killed three Israelis in a terror attack at a border crossing, Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on Tuesday morning. The terrorist, 39-year-old Maher Diab al-Jazi, shot and killed three Israelis at the Allenby border crossing, near Jericho, after approaching the cargo area in a truck from the Jordanian side. He exited the vehicle during an inspection and began firing at guards, who returned fire, killing Al-Jazi. Following the attack, Israel temporarily closed its three other land crossings. Israeli officials have not commented on the return of al-Jazi’s body. The Allenby crossing is primarily used by Palestinians in Judea and Samaria to travel to Jordan. Israeli travelers use border crossings in Eilat and the northern Jordan Valley. The victims were identified as Yohanan Shahouri, a 61-year-old father of six from Ma’ale Efraim, 65-year-old Yuri Birnbaum, of Moshav Naama near Jericho, and Adrian Marcelo Podmesser, a resident of Ariel. All three worked at the crossing. Approximately 70% of the Jordanian population is Palestinian, and Hamas enjoys wide popularity. However, the terror group’s alignment with Iran makes its relations with Amman tense. Since the start of the Gaza war, a surge of anti-Israel protests has erupted across Jordan, especially in the capital Amman and other major cities. Ordinary Jordanians celebrated the attack with fireworks and distributing sweets.

Hamas, Houthis open offices in Baghdad	Thomas Juneau, a professor of international relations at the University of Ottawa, told the Times that Iran wants its proxies to coordinate more closely. By JNS Hamas and the Houthis have recently established offices in Iraq. The offices, which opened in June, testify to Iraq’s shift towards the Iranian camp in Tehran’s conflict with Israel and the United States. Since the U.S. military invasion to remove Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein 21 years ago, the country has maintained an 'uneasy balance' between its Iranian neighbor and America, The New York Times reported on Sunday. That balance has increasingly turned in Iran’s favor as Tehran has funded sympathetic forces inside Iraq as part of its effort to build an unbroken arc of Shi’ite power stretching west to Lebanon and south to Yemen. The Hamas representative in Baghdad is Mohammed al-Hafi, a member of the terrorist group’s bureau for Arab and Islamic Relations. The Houthi representative in Iraq is Abu Idris al-Sharafi. He has received an especially warm reception in Iraq, the Times said. The two offices are a concrete indication of the transformation of Iraqi politics since Hussein’s ouster. He suppressed Islamic movements, whether Sunni or Shi’ite, viewing them as a threat to his power. Shi’ites were exiled, imprisoned or executed. Today, Shi’ite parties dominate Iraqi politics, and Iran has pushed Iraq’s government to recognize Shi’ite militias. (The Hamas representative’s security detail is provided by one such militia, Kata’ib Hezbollah, the Times noted.) Shi’ite forces have formed political parties, gaining enough seats in the 2021 election to select the prime minister. Faced with the Shi’ite’s rise, Iraq’s leadership could do little but agree when Hamas and the Houthis requested to open offices. 'Some Iraqi government officials, according to two of the people who spoke to The New York Times, say privately they are not thrilled about their new guests but did not have the power to block them given the sway of the Iraqi political parties with ties to Iran,' the paper reported. Officially, Iraq has denied a move towards Iran. Thomas Juneau, a professor of international relations at the University of Ottawa, told the Times that Iran wants its proxies to coordinate more closely. There is 'a growing institutionalization of relations between Iran’s partners in the Axis of Resistance,' he said. Tehran has created a joint operation room and held regular meetings to bring proxy leaders together. 'Iran has appeared to encourage its proxies from different countries to share military skills and even coordinate on targets,' the Times reported. These efforts have 'intensified' since Oct. 7, Juneau said. Rashid al-Azzawi, chairman of the Iraqi Islamic Party, a Sunni Islamist party, said the war in Gaza has won sympathy for Hamas from Iraqis across all religions. Hamas is seen as fighting for 'a humanitarian cause,' he stated.

Hamas chief Sinwar thanks Hezbollah leader for ‘your blessed acti...	Sinwar also thanked Nasrallah for expressing condolences for the death of Ismail Haniyeh. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar thanked the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah for his group’s support in the conflict with Israel, Hezbollah said on Friday, in the first reported message since Sinwar became Hamas’s overall leader in August. The Iran-backed Hezbollah has been waging attacks on Israel for nearly a year in a conflict across the Lebanese-Israeli border that has been taking place in parallel to the Gaza war. Hezbollah says its attacks aim to support the Palestinians. 'Your blessed actions have expressed your solidarity on the fronts of the Axis of Resistance, supporting and engaging in the battle,' Sinwar told Nasrallah, according to Hezbollah‘s al-Manar broadcaster. Sinwar has not appeared in public since the Oct. 7 attacks, and is widely thought to be running the war from tunnels beneath Gaza. It was the second time this week he is reported to have sent a letter. Hamas said on Tuesday he had sent one congratulating Algerian President Abdulmadjid Tebboune on his re-election. Hezbollah is the most powerful faction in an alliance of Iran-backed groups known as the Axis of Resistance, which have also entered the fray with attacks from Yemen and Iraq in support of Hamas during the Gaza war. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are internationally designated terrorist groups which receive funding, weapons, and training from Iran. Hezbollah has pummeled northern Israeli communities almost daily with barrages of drones, rockets, and missiles from southern Lebanon, where it wields significant political and military influence, since the start of the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas in October. About 80,000 Israelis have been forced to evacuate Israel’s north during that time due to the unrelenting attacks. Most of them have spent the past 11 months living displaced in hotels in other areas of he country. Nonetheless, in the early days of the Gaza conflict, former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal hinted at frustration over the scale of Hezbollah‘s intervention, thanking the group but saying 'the battle requires more.' Over the last year, Israel has killed around 500 Hezbollah fighters, including its top military commander Fuad Shukr. The toll is greater than Hezbollah‘s losses in its 2006 war with Israel. Hezbollah has said it had no advance knowledge of the Oct. 7 attack, which Sinwar masterminded. Sinwar also thanked Nasrallah for a letter he sent expressing condolences for the death of Ismail Haniyeh, the former Hamas leader killed in Tehran in July in an assassination widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. The hostilities across the Lebanese-Israeli border have forced tens of thousands of people to leave both sides of the frontier. The risk of escalation has loomed large. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Tuesday that Israeli forces are near to fulfilling their mission in Gaza and their focus will turn to the Lebanon border. Israeli leaders have said they would prefer to resolve the conflict through an agreement that would push Hezbollah away from the border. Hezbollah has said that it will continue fighting as long as the Gaza war continues.

Israel barring Palestinian Authority chief from Gaza – report	Egypt reportedly gives green light to Mahmoud Abbas to visit Gaza Strip - so long as Israel approves his entry, which Jerusalem has thus far refused to do. By World Israel News Staff Israel is barring the chairman of the Palestinian Authority from visiting the Gaza Strip - part of a bid by the P.A. to bolster its standing in the coastal enclave as a prelude to restoring control over the area - Kan Reshet Bet reported Tuesday morning. According to the report, the Palestinian Authority has sought the assistance of Egypt in securing P.A. chairman Mahmoud Abbas' entry into the Gaza Strip via the Rafah Crossing on the Sinai-Gaza border. Citing a foreign Arab diplomat, the P.A. also reached out to Israel to facilitate Abbas' visit. Egypt reportedly responded to the Palestinian Authority's request by expressing a willingness to cooperate, on condition that Israel approves the P.A. chief's visit. Cairo also said that it would be willing to open the Rafah Crossing, which has been closed with few exceptions since the war began on October 7th, to enable Abbas and his entourage to enter from the Egyptian border. The Egyptian government reportedly backs Abbas' visit as part of its overall policy of backing the Palestinian Authority's bid to restore its control over the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Authority governed most of the Gaza Strip from the P.A.'s formation in 1994, and ruled over all of Gaza from Israel's withdrawal in 2005 until 2007, when Hamas seized control of the Strip. Following the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7th, the P.A. has demanded that Israel return control over Gaza to it. The Biden administration has endorsed the P.A.'s position; on condition Ramallah undertakes significant political reforms. Egypt has protested Israel's plans to retain control over the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border, including the Rafah area, even after the current war.

Iran vows ‘nightmare’ attack on Israel	Israel is 'shaking' in fear of Iran's expected vengeance for the Ismail Haniyeh assassination, said IRGC head Hossein Salami. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Iran continued its war of words with Israel Sunday, with a top military commander threatening a 'nightmare' attack on the Jewish state, Al-Arabiya reported Monday. At a meeting in Yasuj, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Hossein Salami claimed that Israel’s leaders and people are frightened of Iran’s promised vengeance for Hamas political head Ismail Haniyeh being assassinated in July in the heart of a well-guarded compound in Tehran by an explosive planted in his bedroom. The success greatly embarrassed the Islamic Republic and it immediately blamed Israel, although Jerusalem never took public credit for the assassination of one of its key enemies. 'The nightmare of Iran's inevitable response is shaking Israel day and night,' Salami said. Warning that Iran’s response will be 'painful and different' than expected, he added, 'The usurping Zionist regime and its allies should not think that they will be struck and run away. Rather, they should realize that they will be struck and will not be able to run away. They will receive great lessons and learn not to play with the lion's tail.' Iran’s leaders have threatened vengeance many times since Haniyeh was eliminated, although they have been careful to state that it would come at a time of their own choosing. When attempting to avenge the IAF elimination of several of its top military men in Damascus in early April, the mullahs launched more than 300 missiles at Israel less than two weeks later. Almost none of them got through an aerial defense that included the militaries of the U.S., Great Britain, France and Jordan as well as Israel. Practically no damage was caused by the few that landed, and there was only one injury, of a young girl who recovered after a few months in the hospital. One possible scenario could be that Iran unleashes its top terror proxy, Hezbollah in Lebanon, to go all out against the Jewish state. So far, the Shiite terrorists have launched over 7,000 rockets, missiles, UAVs and other airborne projectiles over the border to support Hamas in its war with Israel, forcing the evacuation of some 60,000 Israelis from border communities. However, Hezbollah was also prepared to fire over a thousand rockets at once some two weeks ago, in what was seen as a possible Iranian-ordered revenge attack, but the IDF destroyed all the launchers in a pre-emptive strike. Still, it is believed to have some 140,000 rockets left in its arsenal, and many more trained fighters than Hamas. Israel has been on high alert in the north since the beginning of the war, keeping a substantial number of troops there and sending its air force to strike innumerable Hezbollah targets in Lebanon almost daily in response to the terrorists’ launches. There are many voices in Israel calling for an all-out attack on Hezbollah because it is untenable that the terrorists have succeeded in shutting down a whole area of the country for almost a year. The U.S. is trying to defuse the situation by using diplomatic means, believing that all-out war in the north could turn the conflict into a regional one and be 'catastrophic.' IRGC Commander-In-Chief General Hossein Salami: The Zionist Regime Is Trembling in Fear of the Nightmare of Iran's Retaliation; They Will Taste the Bitterness of Revenge, But It Will Be Different This Time; They Will Learn Not to Play with the Lion’s Tail #Iran #IRGC pic.twitter.com/TaJqT93M3n &mdash; MEMRI (@MEMRIReports) September 10, 2024 The post Iran vows 'nightmare' attack on Israel appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/iran-vows-nightmare-attack-on-israel/	2024-09-10T03:55:14-07:00	
Iran ‘certain’ to take revenge on Israel for Haniyeh killing, sen...	No doubt about it,' says deputy chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps: 'Revenge is certain.' By World Israel News Staff Iran is still planning a major retaliatory action in response to Israel's killing of a top Hamas terrorist in Tehran over a month ago, a senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officer said over the weekend. Speaking at a ceremony marking his promotion, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Naqdi, the deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said that despite more than a month passing since the assassination of Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh in a targeted killing attributed to Israel, Iran remains intent on avenging the late Islamist leader's death. 'Revenge is certain, and we have made it clear on multiple occasions,' Naqdi said. 'There is no doubt about it. The retaliation must happen at the right time to be effective.' Naqdi hinted that the planned retaliatory plot is already in motion, without providing details. During his address, Naqdi also condemned the U.S. over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. 'The U.S. is complicit in the atrocities in Gaza,' Naqdi said. 'America is the only sponsor and supporter of these crimes, and they invite the prime minister of the child-killing Zionist regime to the American Congress, and for five minutes they clap and whistle for the child-killing prime minister of the Zionist regime and stand forty times.' Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in his vacation home in Tehran on July 31st, after he traveled to Iran ahead of the inauguration of President Masud Pezeshkian. Within hours of the killing, Iran threatened to avenge Haniyeh's assassination with attacks on Israel. However, in mid-August, senior Iranian officials hinted that an Iranian retaliation could be avoided should Israel and Hamas reach a ceasefire deal in talks brokered by Qatar and Egypt.

Erdogan calls for Islamic alliance against Israel	For the first time in 12 years, Erdogan hosted Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to repair ties between the two countries. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged Islamic countries to form an alliance against Israel to combat what he calls 'the growing threat of expansionism' posed by the Jewish state. The declaration comes shortly after news of the death of a Turkish-American anti-Israel protester in Schem, allegedly caused by Israeli security forces. Erdogan said at an Islamic schools event in Istanbul, 'The only step that will stop Israeli arrogance, Israeli banditry, and Israeli state terrorism is the alliance of Islamic countries.' Recently, Turkey has made gestures to improve relations with Egypt and Syria 'to form a line of solidarity' against alleged Israeli 'expansionism' into Syria and Lebanon. For the first time in 12 years, Erdogan hosted Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to repair ties between the two countries. The Turkish president also extended an invitation to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 'any time' to renew the connection between the two countries, which was broken during the 2011 Syrian civil war. Relations between Israel and Turkey, which had been tense before October 7th, have deteriorated further, with Erdogan showing a marked sympathy for Hamas. Although Turkey had been one of Israel's trading partners, Erdogan announced a full trade embargo against Israel in April until the Jewish State submits to a full ceasefire. A statement from the Turkish Trade Ministry said, 'This decision will remain in place until Israel, under its obligations emanating from international law, urgently declares a ceasefire in Gaza and allows the unhindered flow of sufficient humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.' In addition, Erdogan has invited Hamas leaders, including Ismail Haniyeh, who was later assassinated, to Turkey. Erdogan has accused Israel of wanting to conquer Turkey after the Gaza war and has even floated the notion of invading Israel to forcibly stop the Gaza war. 'We must be very strong so that Israel can’t do these…things to Palestine,' Erdogan said at a meeting of his AK party held in Rize, Turkey. 'Just like we entered Karabakh [Azerbaijan], just like we entered Libya, we might do similar to them,' Erdogan said in the televised discussion. 'There is no reason why we cannot do this … We must be strong so that we can take these steps.' In addition, Erdogan called Haniyeh a 'martyr' after his assassination, and Israel's Foreign Ministry reprimanded the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv for lowering its flag to half-mast to mourn the terrorist leader.

Palestinian state would be a ‘punishment’ for Hamas, says US amba...	Denying that establishment of Palestinian state would reward October 7th atrocities, Ambassador Jack Lew downplays Biden's criticism of Netanyahu and defends administration's continued push for two-state solution. By World Israel News Staff American Ambassador Jack Lew defended the Biden administration's continued support of Palestinian statehood, pushing back on claims that the establishment of such a state would constitute a victory for terrorism, even after October 7th. Speaking at a conference hosted by the Institute for National Security Studies on Thursday, Lew downplayed tensions between the Biden White House and the Netanyahu government, after President Joe Biden recently accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of not doing enough to secure a hostage deal with Hamas. 'He was asked a question, and gave a one-word answer - 'no,'' Lew said. 'I would not attach too much meaning to one word. Everyone needs to do more.' When pressed as to whether Netanyahu should do more to reach a deal with Hamas, Lew said: 'In any negotiation, everyone needs to be flexible.' Lew also minimized the administration's restrictions on arms transfers to Israel, claiming only a single shipment was delayed, despite reports the White House had slow-walked transfers of a number of weapons systems. 'There was one shipment that was put on hold because we have different views on the appropriate use of one weapons system. There was never an embargo.' 'The day that shipment was held, aircraft delivered munition to Israel.' 'Friends can have different views about the use of a 2000-pound bomb. It was blown way out of proportion.' The 69-year-old attorney, who once served as President Obama's chief of staff and later as Secretary of the Treasury, rejected claims that the Biden administration's continued support for Palestinian statehood constituted a reward for terrorism. 'A long-term vision of how two people can live together and for there to be a democratic Jewish state of Israel,' Lew argued, would serve as a 'defeat for Iran and Hamas.' 'Not a reward for October 7th, but punishment.'

UN General Assembly passes resolution calling for Jerusalem Old C...	Argentina, Czechia, Fiji, Hungary, Malawi, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga, Tuvalu and the United States joined Israel in opposing the resolution. By Mike Wagenheim, JNS Jerusalem’s Old City and Jude and Samaria must be judenrein within a year, according to a Palestinian-drafted resolution, which the U.N. General Assembly passed on Wednesday. The resolution, which passed by a 124-14 margin with 43 abstentions, is meant to give force to a July advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice, which declared Israeli presence to be illegal in any area over the 1949 armistice line. More than 40 countries sponsored the resolution, which was the first that Palestinians filed after being granted unprecedented privileges, for a non-U.N. member, earlier this year. The resolution calls on the Israel Defense Forces to withdraw completely from Judea and Samaria, eastern Jerusalem and Gaza within 12 months, which means evacuating all Jewish communities beyond the armistice line, including Jerusalem’s Old City. It also bans arms sales to the IDF of any equipment that would be expected reasonably to be used in the territory over the 1949 lines and calls for a boycott of all products produced by Jews in those areas. The resolution text lacks any mention of Israeli security concerns, historic ties to the lands or Hamas’s terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. The vote came after a day of debate on Tuesday. Argentina, Czechia, Fiji, Hungary, Malawi, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga, Tuvalu and the United States joined Israel in opposing the resolution. Notably, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Ukraine and Australia were among those who abstained. General Assembly resolutions have no legal force, but the resolution’s passage on Wednesday is expected to be used in international courts and other fora to seek additional action against the Jewish state. It is widely expected that the Palestinians will request that the U.N. Security Council take up the issue. Security Council resolutions are binding, but the United States would be expected to thwart such an effort, including with its veto power. ‘Further fuel on worldwide antisemitism’ Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, called it 'a shameful decision that backs the Palestinian Authority’s diplomatic terrorism.' He added that the General Assembly 'continues to dance to the music of the Palestinian Authority, which backs the Hamas murderers.' Before the vote, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told reporters he would back the implementation of the resolution should it pass. Seth Riklin and Daniel Mariaschin, president and CEO respectively of B’nai B’rith International, said that the international nonprofit is 'appalled' by the 'atrocious' resolution. 'B’nai B’rith International strongly condemns the U.N. General Assembly’s passage of the first resolution officially sponsored by Palestinians days after they became the first non-member state group further upgraded to many member state privileges at the U.N. General Assembly, despite the world body’s own rules and practices,' the duo stated. 'Coming from an assembly in which Arab and other pro-Palestinian governments wield an automatic majority to annually condemn Israel more than all other countries combined, the motion is unprecedented in its shamelessly one-sided endorsement of Palestinian claims and political demands, and further erodes the U.N.’s credibility as a serious contributor to promoting conflict-resolution and universal human rights,' they added. 'Shame on all countries that enabled this atrocious affront to justice and peace as part of the latest UNGA ’emergency session’ on the Middle East that does nothing to help seriously address and settle the emergency,' Riklin and Mariaschin said. Arsen Ostrovsky and Nadav Steinman, CEO and board chair respectively of the International Legal Forum, stated that 'today, simply put, the United Nations has become the diplomatic arm of Hamas' and that the resolution 'is just the latest in a litany of obscenely one-sided anti-Israel resolutions at the U.N. since Oct. 7.' 'All it does is reward the murderers, rapists and abductors of Hamas while pouring further fuel on worldwide antisemitism and eroding whatever remaining credibility of the already problematic and politicized International Court of Justice, upon which this resolution is meant to be based,' they added. 'Ultimately, peace will only prevail when Hamas is defeated and the hostages are released, not through tiresome antics and pyrrhic Palestinian ‘victories’ at the U.N.'

Finland’s president defends decisions to buy Israeli arms, not re...	President Alexander Stubb, who took office in March, has defined his and Finland’s new foreign policy stance as 'values-based realism.' By Reuters and The Algemeiner Finland’s President Alexander Stubb defended his country’s decision to buy arms from Israel despite the war in Gaza, saying it had no link to Finland’s unwillingness to recognize an independent Palestinian state at the present time. Finland is acquiring a ground based, high altitude, missile defense system called David’s Sling from Israel. Helsinki considers the system a high priority for its own defense due to neighboring Russia’s ongoing missile attacks on civilian and military targets in Ukraine. Stubb, who took office in March, has defined his and Finland’s new foreign policy stance as 'values-based realism,' which he has said was about 'achieving things in the world as it is,' instead of 'promoting only the world how I want to see it.' In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Stubb said the time was not right to recognize a Palestinian state, even though its Nordic neighbors, Sweden, Iceland, and most recently Norway, have done so. 'In the case of Israel and Palestine, values-based realism is prevalent in our thinking on the recognition of Palestine in the sense that we want that recognition, not if, but when it happens, to have an impact towards a two-state solution and a peaceful solution,' he said. Last month, Stubb told Finnish diplomats that Finland’s recognition of a Palestinian state was 'a matter of time' and that the right time would be picked strategically to promote peace in the Middle East. He said the decision had 'nothing to do with' the arms deal with Israel. 'In that one, I only look at realism, in other words, the fact that we need those weapons. So that’s when I look at Finnish security.'

Holocaust mass grave found in Belarusian town	Estimates suggest that between 3,000 and 4,000 Jews from Stresyn and neighboring towns fell victim to the Holocaust. By Jewish Breaking News A small Belarusian town now stands as a sobering testament to the Holocaust’s devastation after the discovery this week of a mass grave holding Jewish victims. Once home to a thriving Jewish community, Stresyn and its surrounding Gomel region bore witness to the Holocaust’s devastation. In 1939, Jews comprised nearly 30% of the area’s population, with around 40,000 residents. While many managed to flee before the Nazi occupation in 1941, those who remained faced confinement in three ghettos with staggeringly high mortality rates. Estimates suggest that between 3,000 and 4,000 Jews from Stresyn and neighboring towns fell victim to the Holocaust. Among the 23 bodies found on Tuesday were those of 12 adults and 11 children, the youngest barely a year old and the oldest child just seven. While the remains showed no obvious signs of execution, the discovery of keys and a corroded rifle bullet within the burial site hints at the horror experienced by Stresyn’s Jewish community during the Final Solution. Local authorities suggest that these individuals likely succumbed to the inhumane conditions within the ghetto, where Jewish residents were forcibly relocated after having their property looted by the invading Nazis. According to state news agency Balta, a local resident uncovered the remains during routine agricultural work nearly 15 years ago. Despite widespread community knowledge about the ghetto’s Jewish victims, the grave’s existence curiously remained unreported until now.

John Fetterman slams ‘anti-Israel’ UN experts for censuring Weste...	The most outspoken of the UN experts on Monday was Francesca Albanese, the UN’s notoriously controversial special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner US Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) lambasted 'anti-Israel' UN human rights experts for censuring Western countries on Monday over their continued support for Israel despite what they described as a genocide in Gaza. 'These so-called ‘experts’ have consistently revealed their anti-Israel bias and a censure from one of them is a badge of honor,' Fetterman posted on X/Twitter. 'No apologies and zero conditions for any essential support for Israel.' Fetterman also posted a picture from a news story reporting on the warnings from the UN experts. These so-called ‘experts’ have consistently revealed their anti-Israel bias and a censure from one of them is a badge of honor. No apologies and zero conditions for any essential support for Israel. pic.twitter.com/YMZUOYmw1J &mdash; Senator John Fetterman (@SenFettermanPA) September 16, 2024 The most outspoken of the UN experts on Monday was Francesca Albanese, the UN’s notoriously controversial special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories. 'Shockingly, in the face of the abyss reached in the OPT [Occupied Palestinian Territories] … most member states remained inactive at best, or actively aiding and assisting Israel’s criminal conduct,' Albanese told a press conference in Geneva. 'I think it’s unavoidable for Israel to become a pariah in the face of its continuous, relentless, vilifying assault of the United Nations, on top of millions of Palestinians.' Israel has denied such allegations, noting the extensive lengths to which its military has gone to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, where Hamas often places its military targets within or underneath civilian targets such as schools and hospitals. Though Fetterman campaigned as a progressive, he has surprisingly emerged as a staunch ally of Israel in the months following Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attacks. Fetterman has repeatedly condemned anti-Israel voices within his own party in the US Congress, as well as elite universities for tolerating what he has characterized as antisemitic and anti-Israel hate speech on their campuses. Fetterman’s criticism came as Brown University in Rhode Island received backlash over its decision to host Albanese for a discussion on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Ivy League university hosted Albanese, an Italian lawyer, for a talk on Monday titled 'Anatomy of a Genocide: A Failure of the International System?' The roughly hour-and-a-half discussion centered on the international community’s response to Israel’s ongoing defensive military operations in Hamas-ruled Gaza. Toward the beginning of the discussion, Albanese decried Israel’s military campaign as the 'monstrosity of this century.' 'To justify the protection of their security, Israel continues to take land from the Palestinians, subjugate the Palestinians, and impose conditions of life that result in humiliation and indignities,' Albanese said during the livestream. Though Albanese insisted that she has repeatedly condemned Hamas’s Oct. 7 slaughter of roughly 1,200 people and kidnapping of 251 others in southern Israel, she said she believes the Jewish state’s response has been disproportionate. As Albanese has done many times before, she accused Israel of targeting schools, hospitals, designated safe zones, and using starvation as a weapon against the population. Israel has denied such accusations, noting its efforts to evacuate areas before it targets them and to warn residents of impending military operations with leaflets, text messages, and other forms of communication. However, Hamas has in many cases prevented people from leaving, according to the Israeli military. Another challenge for Israel is Hamas’s widely recognized military strategy of embedding its terrorists within Gaza’s civilian population and commandeering civilian facilities like hospitals, schools, and mosques to run operations and direct attacks. Nonetheless, Albanese condemned Israel’s allies, saying they 'should have changed course of action,' citing concerns over the humanitarian conditions in Gaza. 'Instead they have continued to give Israel financial, economic, and political support and courage, and this is the failure of the system,' Albanese said. She expressed gratitude toward students and university faculty members who have participated in anti-Israel demonstrations against Israel’s so-called 'genocidal' war in Gaza. Albanese’s participation in an official Brown University event drew widespread backlash from members of the school’s academic community. Over 2,400 members of the Brown community signed a letter urging the school to disinvite the controversial UN expert. Albanese has been widely criticized for exhibiting an apparent bias against Israel. Albanese has an extensive history of using her role at the UN to denigrate Israel and seemingly rationalize Hamas’s attacks on the Jewish state. In the months following Hamas’s brutal Oct. 7 assault on the Jewish state, Albanese has accused Israel of enacting a 'genocide'against the Palestinian people in revenge for the Oct. 7 attacks. The United Nations has recently launched a probe against Albanese over allegedly accepting a trip to Australia funded by pro-Hamas organizations. She has called on the UN to expel Israel, comparing the Jewish state to apartheid-era South Africa.

Taiwanese electronics company denies it manufactured pagers used ...	Gold Apollo claims it was not responsible for manufacturing the pagers which were apparently modified by Israeli agents and used to bomb thousands of Hezbollah terrorists. By World Israel News Staff A Taiwanese electronics company denied Wednesday that it was involved in the manufacturing of pagers used by Hezbollah terrorists and detonated in a mass attack on Tuesday, injuring thousands of operatives in the Iranian-backed group. Media reports after Tuesday's attack implicated Israel's Mossad, amid claims its agents implanted miniature explosive devices inside a shipment of thousands of pagers bound for Lebanon's Hezbollah five months ago. According to an analysis by Reuters of images of pagers destroyed in Tuesday's attack, the devices were manufactured by Taiwan's Gold Apollo. However, on Wednesday, Gold Apollo founder and president Hsu Ching-Kuang told reporters outside of the company's headquarters in New Taipei that his company was not involved in manufacturing the devices. 'The product was not ours. It was only that it had our brand on it,' Hsu said. 'We may not be a large company, but we are a responsible one,' the Gold Apollo president said, expressing surprise that the pagers could be rigged with explosives and detonated. 'This is very embarrassing.' In a statement issued by Gold Apollo, the company claimed that the AR-924 model pager was manufactured by Budapest-based company BAC Consulting, and that Gold Apollo had licensed its brand to BAC Consulting. Gold Apollo had granted permission to 'BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in specific regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are entirely handled by BAC,' the company said. Reuters reported Wednesday that it was unable to contact BAC after Tuesday's bombing. Hsu said BAC's payments to Gold Apollo for use of its license were 'very strange,' saying the payments originated in the Middle East.

Republican senators lobby Latin America to vote against UN resolu...	As UN General Assembly debates Palestinian Authority draft resolution ordering Israel to ethnically cleanse Judea and Samaria of Jews within one year, Republican senators lobby Western hemisphere powers to reject the proposal. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The United Nations General Assembly held hearings Tuesday on a draft resolution submitted by Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian Authority's envoy to the U.N., demanding Israel vacate Judea and Samaria within one year, and calling on countries around the world to impose arms embargoes on the Jewish state. The General Assembly is slated to vote on the draft resolution Wednesday, after the body debated the measure a day earlier. If passed, the current version of the non-binding resolution would demand Israel remove not only its military presence in Judea and Samaria but also ethnically cleanse the area of its roughly half a million Jewish residents. Republican senators protested the proposed resolution Tuesday, issuing a joint statement penned by Florida's Marco Rubio, calling the measure a 'absolute disgrace that rewards terrorism.' 'This proposal introduced by the Palestinian delegation, ahead of the United Nations’ General Assembly, is an absolute disgrace that rewards terrorism. It is a clear insult to the Jewish people and anyone who understands history,' the letter reads. 'As we approach the one-year anniversary of the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas and affiliated Palestinian terrorist groups against innocent Israeli civilians, which involved murder, mutilation, and sexual violence, the international community must unequivocally unite against this evil, one-sided effort to delegitimize Israel.' 'Instead of proposing biased and counter-productive initiatives, which will do nothing to advance a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, the international community must focus its energy and resources on ensuring Hamas and other terrorist groups are completely destroyed. We must remain firm to ensure every single hostage held by these terrorists is safely returned to their loved ones.' The letter was signed by Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Rick Scott (R-FL), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY),Tim Scott (R-SC), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Jim Risch (R-ID), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), John Kennedy (R-LA), John Hoeven (R-ND), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Budd (R-NC), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), J.D.

In addition to the letter condemning the draft resolution, Senator Rubio penned letters to two Latin American leaders - Argentinian President Javier Milei and Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader - urging them to vote against the measure in the General Assembly. 'The resolution…calls on countries to not legally recognize Israel’s presence in the Palestinian areas, enforce sanctions on Israeli officials, cease the transfer of arms to Israel that could be used in the Palestinian areas and to avoid establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem,' Rubio wrote. 'These are severe demands that aim to destroy the independence of the Middle East’s only democracy. All democracies should oppose these adverse ambitions.'

US denies involvement in pager attack on Hezbollah	Israel did not give US advance notice of mass pager attack on Hezbollah terrorists, Biden administration official says, distancing US from the attack. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration on Tuesday distanced itself from the apparent mass pager bombing attack, attributed to Israel, against thousands of members of the Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah, claiming that the U.S. was neither involved in the attack nor did the U.S. have any prior knowledge of it. Speaking with reporters at a press briefing Tuesday, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the administration was still looking into the attacks, but emphasized that the U.S. played no role in them, adding that Israel did not disclose its plans to the administration prior to the attack. 'We are gathering information on this incident,' Matthew said. 'I can tell you that the U.S. was not involved in it, the U.S. was not aware of this incident in advance.' 'We’re collecting information in the same way that journalists are across the world to gather the facts about what might have happened.' Miller expressed concern the attack could lead to greater escalations between Israel on one hand and Hezbollah and Iran on the other, and called on all parties to reach a 'diplomatic solution.' 'We are always concerned about any type of event that may cause further escalation. And it remains our message to both Israel and to other parties that they need to do everything they can to try and reach a diplomatic resolution.' Reiterating the Biden administration's support for a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, Miller said an agreement between Israel and Hamas could pave the way for a 'resolution' on Israel's northern border. 'Go back to the fundamental issue we face here which is very difficult to get a diplomatic resolution in the north absent a resolution to the conflict in Gaza, absent a ceasefire in Gaza, which is why we continue to push for that ceasefire because we think it’ll help make it much easier to reach a resolution.'

American Jew sentenced to death for role in foiled coup in Congo	Zalman-Polun is now also the target of conspiracy theories that claim he is a CIA and Mossad agent sent to destabilize the Congolese government. By Jackie Hajdenberg, JTA An American Jew is facing the death penalty for his involvement in an attempted political coup in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in late May. Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun — a Washington, D.C.-area native and father of three — was one of three Americans and 37 people total sentenced to death Friday in the DRC over an attempt in May. The failed coup was led by Christian Malanga, a onetime used car salesman and gold miner who sought to overthrow the country’s president, Félix Tshisekedi. Six people were killed in the coup attempt, parts of which were livestreamed, and Malanga was later shot and killed by the Congolese army while resisting arrest. Zalman-Polun, who pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute marijuana in the United States a decade ago, was reportedly a gold mining business associate of Malanga’s. The other two Americans who were sentenced to death are Marcel Malanga, the son of Christian Malanga, and Tyler Thompson. Zalman-Polun was at the presidential palace before coup leader Christian Malanga was shot dead, according to photos and videos taken that day. Zalman-Polun and the other Americans were caught on the banks of the Congo River as they were trying to escape, according to NPR. They claimed at trial that they were forced to participate in the coup at gunpoint. Zalman-Polun reportedly had been living in South Africa with his family for the past several years. Before that, the family lived in Washington, D.C., where they were members of the Washington Hebrew Congregation, when their first child was born in 2017, according to announcements distributed by the Reform synagogue. Zalman-Polun is now also the target of conspiracy theories that claim he is a CIA and Mossad agent sent to destabilize the Congolese government. Users on X have been sharing a photo of Zalman-Polun and Christian Malanga taken outside of Golan Spy Shop, a technology and security supply store in Tel Aviv, saying that it is proof that they were trained by Israeli forces. Congolese law gives the men five days to appeal their sentences. The country reinstituted the death penalty last year. The U.S. State Department has not declared Zalman-Polun and the other two Americans wrongfully detained, the Associated Press reported, making it unlikely the American government will try to arrange their release. In May, just hours after the attempted coup, U.S. Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo Lucy Tamlyn condemned the coup and the involvement of American citizens. 'I am shocked by the events of this morning and deeply concerned by reports of U.S. citizens allegedly being involved,' Tamlyn wrote on X. 'Please be assured that we will cooperate with DRC authorities to the fullest extent possible as they investigate these criminal acts and hold accountable any U.S. citizens implicated in criminal acts.' Zalman-Polun is not the first Jewish intersection with the DRC’s tumultuous politics. Moise Katumbi, whose father was a Jewish refugee from Greece during the Holocaust, has faced ongoing efforts to block him from running for office, most recently last year when a rival pursued a law that would bar candidates whose parents were not both Congolese; Jewish groups abroad condemned the law as antisemitic. The rival ran against Tshisekedi, the subject of the coup attempt, and received less than 1% of the official vote.

Federal loopholes allow China to buy land near sensitive ports, l...	Chinese Communist Party-tied companies own at least 384,000 acres of American agricultural land, a 30 percent increase since 2019. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon China and other foreign adversaries are still permitted to purchase U.S. land near sensitive Coast Guard facilities, ports, and Energy Department labs, exposing national security gaps that lawmakers say enable hostile regimes to conduct espionage operations on American soil. The Treasury Department's Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the central body responsible for approving land sales to foreign entities, moved to 'significantly expand' its jurisdiction in July, allowing it to review real estate transactions near 50 military and other sensitive sites. That expanded list, however, does not include locations such as 'national laboratories, maritime ports, and critical telecommunications and energy infrastructure,' all of which remain vulnerable to foreign spy operations, according to Reps. Greg Murphy (R., N.C.) and John Moolenaar (R., Mich.). The oversight, the lawmakers say, reflects 'significant gaps in our national security screening regime for land purchases near national security sites.' Their concern comes as China works to ramp up its influence operations and 'wreak havoc' on American infrastructure, efforts that have made combating Chinese land purchases a major political issue in states across the country. 'Coast Guard facilities, Department of Energy National Labs, among other locations, remain off CFIUS’s list of sensitive sites and are thereby vulnerable to foreign adversary exploitation,' Murphy and Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, wrote in a Monday letter to the Treasury Department. 'These loopholes must be closed, and closed quickly. Allowing our adversaries to have potential access to these sites poses risks to both our economic and national security, especially as we see companies with ties to hostile nations continue to increase their investments in the U.S.' Chinese Communist Party-tied companies own at least 384,000 acres of American agricultural land, a 30 percent increase since 2019, though poor federal oversight means the number could be higher. This accounts for nearly $2 billion in holdings, planting Beijing and its interests across the American heartland. Lawmakers from both parties have been sounding the alarm about CCP land purchases for some time, leading CFIUS and other federal agencies to more stringently police Beijing’s land acquisition near some military sites. But as the Treasury Department finalizes its new rule to extend CFIUS’s blacklist to include 50 military installations across 30 states, Murphy and Moolenaar say more must be done to address several critical loopholes. 'Because CFIUS land purchase regulations are not retroactive, land purchases made prior to a site being listed are exempt from CFIUS review,' the lawmakers noted in their letter. Even if federal authorities move forward with expanded restrictions, China’s past land purchases would be immune from scrutiny. 'Xi Jinping would never allow Americans to buy land next to sensitive Chinese bases,' Moolenaar told the Washington Free Beacon. 'Unfortunately, current U.S. policy all too often rolls out the red carpet for CCP land purchases.' CFIUS is not currently examining any restrictions on China’s land purchases near Coast Guard hubs and Energy Department labs, giving the CCP room to pivot to these sites as the American government focuses on restricting land buys near military installations. Murphy and Moolenaar say there is a solid 'national security case for including Coast Guard and other facilities' in CFIUS’s blacklist, given the Coast Guard's chief role in policing America’s maritime boundaries. In June, for instance, several Russian ships sailed within 30 miles of the coast of Florida, prompting the Coast Guard to monitor these activities. A month later, Chinese military ships entered the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone off the coast of Alaska, again drawing a response from the Coast Guard. If Chinese entities owned land near Coast Guard facilities, they could potentially surveil the Coast Guard’s response to national security situations and gain valuable information about how the United States monitors its borders. 'While CFIUS coverage includes many military bases and other sensitive areas, U.S. Coast Guard facilities, National Laboratories, some maritime ports, and critical telecommunications and energy infrastructure are not included,' Murphy told the Free Beacon. 'This leaves the United States vulnerable to hostile nations and malicious actors. We cannot allow bad actors to purchase land in America to harm us.'

Britain to mandate Holocaust education, says PM	British PM Keir Starmer says his government will require all schools to include Holocaust education, citing Hamas October 7th invasion of Israel and subsequent surge in antisemitism as proof of need for curriculum change. By World Israel News Staff Every school in Britain will be required to include Holocaust education in its curriculum, Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged Monday. Speaking during the annual Holocaust Education Trust dinner in London Monday evening, Starmer warned of rising antisemitism in Britain, and vowed to combat the growing trend, comparing it to his efforts to push back on anti-Jewish bigotry within the Labour Party. The event, which drew some 500 attendees, featured British Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, and a number of Holocaust survivors and their families. 'Just as I fought to bring my party back from the abyss of antisemitism, I will do the same in leading the country,' Starmer said. Under the new national curriculum standards being set by the government, Starmer said, British students will hear recorded testimonials from Holocaust survivors. 'Even schools who do not currently have to follow the national curriculum will have to teach the Holocaust when the new curriculum comes in,' Starmer continued. 'For the first time, studying the Holocaust will become a critical, vital part of every single student’s identity. And not just studying it, learning from it too and above all, acting on its lessons.' Starmer said that the surge in antisemitism following the October 7th invasion of Israel demonstrated the dire need for changes to the school curriculum to combat anti-Jewish sentiments. 'Over 1,000 people were massacred by Hamas, for the very same reason: because they were Jewish.' 'We say ‘never again’ and yet in the last year we’ve seen record levels of antisemitism right here in Britain.' Starmer condemned the overt antisemitism displayed at some anti-Israel rallies since October 7th, warning that it was a sign of 'hatred marching on our streets.'

‘Nothing justifies’ Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas, says UN S...	Secretary-General Antonio Guterres claims devastation of Gaza during war against Hamas constitutes 'collective punishment,' calling it unparalleled in recent history. By World Israel News Staff The secretary-general of the United Nations accused Israel of carrying out 'collective punishment' against Palestinian Arabs living in the Gaza Strip, saying 'nothing justifies' the way the current war against the Hamas terror organization is being waged. Speaking with AFP on Monday, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7th and the taking of over 250 hostages, but added that not even Hamas atrocities justify Israel's current war in Gaza. 'It is unimaginable, the level of suffering in Gaza, the level of deaths and destruction have no parallel in everything I've witnessed since [becoming] Secretary-General,' Guterres said Monday. 'We all condemn the terror attacks made by Hamas, as well as the taking of the hostages, that is an absolute violation of international humanitarian law.' 'But the truth is that nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, and that is what we are witnessing in a dramatic way in Gaza.' 'Accountability should be a must,' Guterres said regarding collateral damage, saying both Israel and Hamas were guilty of 'serious violations.' Turning to efforts to reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Guterres lamented that the talks 'are endless,' adding that it would be 'very difficult' to achieve a breakthrough. Guterres has frequently criticized Israel over its handling of the war in Gaza. Last week, the Secretary-General blasted the IDF after the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) claimed that six of its employees were killed in a pair of Israeli airstrikes in the city of Nuseirat in central Gaza. 'What’s happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable,' Guterres tweeted. 'A school turned shelter for around 12,000 people was hit by Israeli airstrikes again today.' 'Six of our UNRWA colleagues are among those killed. These dramatic violations of international humanitarian law need to stop now.' Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, fired back, noting UNRWA’s extensive links to terrorist groups, including Hamas, and suggesting the six UNRWA employees killed were themselves terrorists. 'What is ‘unacceptable,’ Antonio Guterres, is the fact you refuse to recognize reality and continue to distort it,' tweeted Danon. 'Terrorists operating out of civilian buildings previously used by UNRWA are not ‘innocent.’ It is unconscionable that the UN continues to condemn Israel in its just war against terrorists, while Hamas continues to use women and children as human shields.'

‘Is this guy part of a conspiracy?’ Florida Sheriff questions whe...	The former president’s golf schedule had not been publicly disclosed. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon A Florida sheriff is raising questions about whether the attempted assassination of Donald Trump is part of a broader conspiracy. The sheriff, William Snyder of Martin County, Fla., noted that the would-be assassin is not a Florida resident and that the former president's movements on Sunday were not broadcast in advance. 'How does a guy from not here get all the way to Trump International, realize that the president, former president of the United States, is golfing, and is able to get a rifle in that vicinity?' Snyder said Monday. The former president’s golf schedule had not been publicly disclosed. 'I think that’s the question the FBI, the Secret Service are laser-focused on today. Is this guy part of a conspiracy? Is he a lone gunman?' Snyder continued. 'If he’s part of a conspiracy, then this whole thing really takes on a very ominous tone.' The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, allegedly camped at Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course with food, a digital camera, and a loaded rifle with a scope for around 12 hours before the Secret Service spotted him, according to cell phone data obtained by authorities. A Secret Service agent opened fire after noticing the muzzle of a rifle protruding from shrubbery about 400 yards from where Trump was playing. The suspect fled in a vehicle but was apprehended in less than an hour. The incident follows a similar security lapse two months ago, when 20-year-old Thomas Crooks evaded Secret Service detection for at least 20 minutes and nearly assassinated Trump at a July 13 rally in Pennsylvania. Routh, charged Monday with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, appeared to smile and laugh at least three times while speaking to his attorney before the hearing began, Fox News reported. The charges carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. The post 'Is this guy part of a conspiracy?'

‘Israel needs to change’ – Biden admin. hits IDF over killing of ...	Preliminary investigation into the killing of a Turkish-American activist during a riot in Samaria 'does not exonerate' IDF soldiers, says State Department, demanding Israel 'change its policies' for use of force. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration chided the Israeli military Monday over civilian deaths in the ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and over the death of a dual Turkish-American citizen during a riot in Samaria. Speaking with reporters during a press briefing on Monday, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Israel's military must tighten its rules of engagement and policies on the use of force, citing the deaths of humanitarian aid workers in the Gaza Strip as a result of a mistaken IDF airstrike, and the fatal shooting of 26-year-old Turkish-born International Solidarity Movement (ISM) activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi. Eygi was fatally wounded during a Palestinian Arab riot in the town of Beita, south of Nablus (Shechem) in Samaria on September 7th. The IDF has acknowledged that Eygi was likely killed by 'indirect and unintended IDF fire which was aimed at a main instigator' of the riots. During Monday's press briefing, Miller downplayed a preliminary investigation into the shooting, saying the Biden administration did not view its results as exonerating the IDF soldiers involved. 'You look at the initial findings and they already tell you that something went tragically wrong and you had the killing of an American citizen that never should have occurred,' Miller said. 'So when I hear people hold&#8230; the initial findings up as if they somehow exonerated Israeli security forces, they very much do not. And at least in our point of view they very much do not exonerate them. They reveal the need for a number of changes, and we have made clear that’s what needs to happen.' Miller repeatedly called on Israel to change its use of force regulations, noting that the administration has already pressed Jerusalem on the issue. 'Israel needs to change its policies, and we have made that quite clear,' Miller continued, before referencing the April 1st IDF drone strike which hit an aid convoy in Gaza, killing seven aid workers from the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen organization. 'When it comes to the World Central Kitchen strike we made clear that they need to change their deconfliction measures and worked with the UN to get new deconfliction measures in place. Now, those aren’t perfect. We continue to see strikes that result in the death of humanitarian workers; continue to see strikes in Gaza that lead to the tragic, tragic deaths of civilians.' Gaza 'is a very difficult place in which to conduct a military campaign because you have a terrorist organization that embeds itself and hides itself behind civilians, which is why it’s the United States that is at the forefront of pushing for a ceasefire. And when it comes to actions in the West Bank, it’s the – why it’s the United States that’s pushing for changes to the – to Israeli rules of engagement.'

Netanyahu to address UN amid rising Middle East tensions	Netanyahu’s speech is expected to touch on the Abraham Accords and prospects for further peace deals, possibly hinting at progress with Saudi Arabia. By Jewish Breaking News Amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will address the United Nations General Assembly next week. He will depart for New York next Tuesday to meet with world leaders on the sidelines of the assembly followed by his address on Friday afternoon. Netanyahu’s 11th appearance at the UN comes as the Palestinian Authority is pushing for sweeping measures against Israel, including calls for an arms embargo and sanctions. A draft resolution circulated by the PA urges Israel to withdraw from Judea and Samaria within six months and calls for the removal of approximately 500,000 Israeli citizens living in these territories. In response, Foreign Minister Israel Katz has instructed his team to prepare retaliatory measures if the PA violates the Oslo Accords. These reportedly range from freezing funds to cutting security ties with Ramallah. While the exact content of Netanyahu’s speech remains to be seen, it’s likely to cover several key areas. Besides outlining Israel’s historical right to Judea and Samaria, the Prime Minister will likely provide updates on Israel’s humanitarian efforts in Gaza as well as its efforts in dismantling Iran’s regional terror proxies. As in previous years, Netanyahu’s speech is expected to touch on the Abraham Accords and prospects for further peace deals, possibly hinting at progress with Saudi Arabia. Israeli technological innovations in fields like water conservation, agriculture, and medicine are expected to be highlighted as well.

US trade with Iran jumped last year as Tehran wreaked havoc acros...	The United States has repeatedly bypassed sanctions to help Iran access upwards of $100 billion in cash resources, money that lawmakers say is fueling Tehran’s aggression in the Middle East. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon American trade with Iran jumped 43 percent last year, reaching more than $81 million at a time when Tehran’s hardline regime ramped up its terrorist efforts and wreaked havoc across the Middle East, according to a non-public State Department report provided to Congress and reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. The significant jump in trade relations suggests the Biden-Harris administration is bypassing tough American sanctions on Tehran in order to stimulate its flagging economy and provide the hardline regime with a financial lifeline. The United States imported $22.3 million in goods from Iran in 2023 and exported $59 million, accounting for $81.3 million in total trade between the countries, according to the State Department report, which was submitted to Congress earlier this week. Overall trade between the United States and Iran rose by more than $24 million from 2022 to 2023, marking a 43 percent increase, according to figures published in the report. At the same time, Iranian trade with China, one of its closest allies, fell by 7 percent over the same period, indicating the Biden-Harris administration is picking up some of the slack. The report also omitted statistics on Russia’s trade with Iran, with the State Department saying these figures could not be produced. The report, which is unclassified but not disseminated publicly, is driving concerns on Capitol Hill, with GOP critics seeing it as further evidence of the Biden-Harris administration’s bid to boost diplomacy with Tehran as it wages a multi-front war on Israel. The United States has repeatedly bypassed sanctions to help Iran access upwards of $100 billion in cash resources, money that lawmakers say is fueling Tehran’s aggression in the Middle East, including Iran-backed terror group Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish state. 'It’s no surprise that the Iranian regime was able to engage and pay for increased trade with the U.S., and to bolster their economy more broadly,' Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the Free Beacon. 'Indeed, regime outlets have been bragging that trade with the U.S. has doubled again in the first quarter of 2024. Iran then uses their financial and economic strength to conduct terrorism around the world, including terrorism directly targeting Americans.' U.S. trade with Iran primarily consists of 'agricultural goods, medicine, and medical devices,' according to a footnote in the State Department’s report. These exports are facilitated through licenses granted under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, which eased trade restrictions on humanitarian goods. Imports from Iran are allowed by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which has the power to waive certain sanctions for national security reasons. The State Department declined to comment on its findings and would not provide further information about the nature of U.S. trade with Iran, including exactly what goods are being exchanged. A State Department official directed the Free Beacon to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, but they did not respond to a request for comment with similar questions. In addition to the United States, Iranian trade with the United Kingdom jumped by 66 percent from 2022 to 2023. This includes $116 million in imports from Iran and $76 million in exports, according to the report, which does not detail exactly what goods are being exchanged. 'Since the last reporting period,' the State Department wrote, 'overall G20 trade with Iran decreased 14 percent, representing a $5 billion decrease.' The increase in trade between the United States and United Kingdom appeared to be an outlier from the overall trend in 2023. Additionally, 'Saudi Arabia nearly quadrupled its trade with Iran from $5 million to $24.8 million,' indicating the historically chilly relationship between the two regional powers is thawing in some respects. While Iran’s trade with China fell slightly from 2022 to 2023, it still 'makes up 48 percent of Iran’s trade with the G20,' according to the report. Republicans such as Cruz say the findings suggest the United States is easing its trade embargo on Iran. 'The Biden-Harris administration has done everything they can to flood the Ayatollah with cash and facilitate the regime’s ability to finance terrorism,' the senator said. 'They’ve refused to enforce sanctions, waived other sanctions, and worked with banks around the world to free up and transfer Iranian assets.' Iran’s oil revenues, a key source of cash for the regime, have topped more than $90 billion since the Biden-Harris administration came to power and began easing sanctions on Tehran’s energy sector. The administration has also repeatedly issued a sanctions waiver that permits Iraq to pay Iran for electricity imports representing around $10 billion for the regime. It is believed this cash helps Tehran finance its regional terror proxies, including Hamas and Hezbollah, which are both still waging war on Israel.

Germany not barring arms sales to Israel, says lawmaker	Member of German parliament denies report claiming Berlin has imposed de facto arms embargo on Israel. By World Israel News Staff A recent report accusing the German government of imposing a de facto arms embargo on Israel was false, a member of the German national parliament claimed Monday. Over the weekend, Germany's Bilt newspaper reported that Berlin has consistently refused to permit weapons sales to Israel, or responded to requests for arms export permits with indefinite delays, effectively blocking new weapons sales to the Jewish state. For instance, an IDF request for an export permit enabling it to purchase thousands of tank shells has simply been ignored by Berlin thus far, the report claimed. 'The growing concerns are the reason why fewer approvals are being granted, even if no one wants to say it out loud,' an official working fora representative on the German Federal Security Council told Profil Magazine. As a result, weapons sales to Israel have plummeted this year, dropping from 300 million Euros in 2023 to just 14 million in 2024. A conservative lawmaker in the German Bundestag, however, denied the report, telling Israel Hayom that after looking into the report's claims, he found no evidence of a deliberate effort to prevent arms sales to Israel. 'After consulting with my office, we have no knowledge of any companies being denied security export licenses to Israel,' Klaus-Peter Willsch, a member of the center-right Christian Democratic Union said during a trip to Israel Monday. Willsch said he backed arms sales to Israel, comparing support for Israel against Hamas to Germany's support for Ukraine in its ongoing war against Russia. 'I endorse exports to Israel, just as I support exports to Ukraine. Both hold significant importance.'

Number of Hezbollah terrorists killed or wounded by beepers likel...	The estimation is that there are many dozens of dead, if not more.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Although the official number indicates that a dozen Hezbollah terrorists have been killed over the last two days by exploding pagers, it is most likely higher than what has been reported. Ronen Bergman, who writes for the New York Times and Yediot Ahronoth, says the number of people killed by the beeper explosions is higher than the reported 12 yesterday and 14 today. 'The estimation is that there are many dozens of dead, if not more,' he said. In addition, the mission caused massive damage to Hezbollah's Radwan unit, which has lost much of its leadership. Israel has not commented on the deadly explosions, which are widely attributed to Israel. The offensive on Tuesday involved the spontaneous explosion of thousands of beepers used by Hezbollah terrorists, wounding thousands and killing over a dozen, according to reports. Additional injuries and deaths occurred on Wednesday in Lebanon and in Syria, where 19 IRGC terrorists were killed and 150 were injured. A former commander of British military forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, praised the beeper offensive against Hezbollah as 'precise and discriminatory' and effective at weakening the morale and capacity of the Lebanese terror group. Israel’s outsmarting them with this terror attack has led to Hezbollah’s 'demoralization.' Kemp also praised the mission because it effectively targeted only terrorists and limited civilian casualties. 'It’s hard to think of a more precise and discriminating method of attack than detonating pagers known to be specifically assigned to individual terrorists, using devices that limit the potential for collateral damage.' He added that the exploding beepers were intended only for terrorists who are 'legitimate and lawful targets for attack as Israel seeks to defend its citizens from violent aggression,' he said. Kemp added that three distinctive characteristics of the mission made it particularly effective. First, the mission resulted in extensive damage to Hezbollah, second it engendered anxiety in Hezbollah members and may discourage others from joining and third, it has humiliated Hezbollah on the world stage.

Former commander calls beeper offensive against Hezbollah ‘precis...	Exploding beepers were intended only for terrorists who are 'legitimate and lawful targets for attack as Israel seeks to defend its citizens from violent aggression.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The former commander of British military forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, praised the beeper offensive against Hezbollah as 'precise and discriminatory' and effective at weakening the morale and capacity of the Lebanese terror group. The offensive on Tuesday involved the spontaneous explosion of thousands of beepers used by Hezbollah terrorists, wounding thousands and killing over a dozen. Additional injuries and deaths occurred on Wednesday in Lebanon and in Syria, where 19 IRGC terrorists were killed and 150 were injured. Kemp told Israel National News that three salient factors make the beeper mission uniquely effective. 'First, it will have done immense damage to the terrorist organization, taking a large number of its fighters and leaders out in one go. Plus, of course, it severely undermines their communications capability,' Kemp said. He added, 'Second, it will have intimidated Hezbollah, potentially frightening some members into leaving the group or scaring off recruits from joining.' Kemp explained, 'The psychological impact will be enormous, with every Hezbollah terrorist now fearing that almost everything he owns or touches, including cars, guns, laptops, radios, and other electrical items, could potentially be weaponized against them.' He added the constant anxiety Hezbollah members may feel now is a 'far cry from the supposed glory of battlefield martyrdom they were promised.' In addition, Hezbollah may retreat from the notion of a full-scale offensive against Israel since now they realize their terror group operations and technology have been infiltrated. 'Third, it has humiliated Hezbollah, a terrorist organization that struts its power on the world stage, presenting itself as one of the strongest armies in the Middle East.' Israel's outsmarting them with this terror attack has led to Hezbollah's 'demoralization.' Kemp also praised the mission because it effectively targeted only terrorists and limited civilian casualties. 'It’s hard to think of a more precise and discriminating method of attack than detonating pagers known to be specifically assigned to individual terrorists, using devices that limit the potential for collateral damage.'

More Hezbollah comms devices explode across Lebanon, killing 14	At least one of the blasts took place in the vicinity of a funeral for terrorists killed on Tuesday. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS More communications devices used by Hezbollah terrorists exploded on Wednesday afternoon across the group’s main stronghold in Beirut and in Southern Lebanon, Reuters reported, citing a security source. According to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, at least fourteen Hezbollah operatives were killed in the latest series of device explosions. In addition, some 400 terrorists were said to have sustained wounds. At least one of the blasts took place in the vicinity of a funeral for terrorists killed on Tuesday, when thousands of Hezbollah pagers detonated all over the country, according to eyewitness reports. The Hezbollah devices that exploded late Wednesday afternoon are hand-held walkie-talkies, a Lebanese security source told Reuters. Axios cited sources familiar with the matter as saying that the radios, which were booby-trapped in advance by Israeli intelligence, were part of the terror group’s emergency communications systems that were supposed to be used during a conflict with the Israel Defense Forces. תיעוד | פיצוץ מכשיר בביירות בזמן הלווית אחד ממחבלי חזבאללה שחוסלו אתמול@Doron_Kadosh pic.twitter.com/rT6dlmutpb &mdash; גלצ (@GLZRadio) September 18, 2024 On Tuesday, more than 2,700 Hezbollah operatives were wounded and at least 12 were killed across Lebanon when their pagers exploded, with the terrorist organization saying it held Israel 'fully responsible.' Speaking at a Wednesday funeral for several of the terrorists killed the day prior, Hezbollah executive council head Hashem Safieddine vowed a 'bloodily unique revenge' against the Jewish state, local reports said. 'Tomorrow, the leader of Hezbollah will speak and all will be revealed,' Safieddine said. 'We will be in a new situation and a new confrontation with this enemy.' The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on Tuesday’s incident, which came just hours after the Israeli Cabinet added the return of citizens displaced from their homes in the north to the country’s war goals, bringing a potential major clash with Hezbollah closer to reality. Iran-backed Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones. The attacks have so far killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage. Tens of thousands of civilians remain internally displaced due to the violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein this week that displaced Israelis will not be able to return home without strong military or diplomatic action against Hezbollah. Netanyahu 'made it very clear that it will not be possible to return our residents without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north,' Netanyahu’s office stated after a Monday meeting in Tel Aviv. Jerusalem will 'ultimately do what is necessary to safeguard its security and return the residents of the north securely to their homes,' he vowed.

19 Iranian soldiers killed, 150 injured in pager bombings, Israel...	Israel's pager bombing attack on Hezbollah also impacted Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces in Syria, killing 19 and wounding 150. By World Israel News Staff At least 19 soldiers in Iran's paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed and roughly 150 more were injured in pager explosions in eastern Syria, according to Arabic media reports Wednesday. On Tuesday, thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah operatives across Lebanon detonated simultaneously in a mass attack attributed to Israel. Eleven people were killed and roughly 4,000 injured in the explosions in Lebanon. According to a report by the Saudi-based Al Hadath outlet on Wednesday, however, the pager bombings also killed 19 members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps stationed in the Deir Ez-Zur province of eastern Syria. In addition, some 150 other Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps members were injured, Al Hadath reported. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was among those injured in the attack, reportedly being completely blinded in one eye and partially blinded in the other. While Iran initially downplayed the severity of his injuries, The New York Times reported that not only was Amani blinded, but that he lost one eye in the attack, while the other was seriously damaged, leaving him with extremely limited vision. Hossein Soleimani, who heads the IRGC’s news website Mashregh, confirmed on X that Amani had been seriously wounded, several hours after the blasts. 'Unfortunately the injuries sustained by Iran’s ambassador were extremely severe and in his eyes,' Soleimani wrote, acknowledging the severity of Amani's injuries. Some 500 Hezbollah operatives were also blinded, either partially or entirely, as a result of the pager explosions, Al Hadath reported. Media reports after Tuesday’s attack implicated Israel’s Mossad, amid claims its agents implanted miniature explosive devices inside a shipment of thousands of pagers bound for Lebanon’s Hezbollah five months ago. Israel is widely believed to be behind the operation but remains silent and has not acknowledged responsibility.

Dozens of Israeli ministers and Coalition MKs demand Israeli take...	The 27 coalition members urged the prime minister to adopt the 'Generals’ Plan' of a group of generals designed to put real pressure on Hamas. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Dozens of MKs and ministers from the coalition wrote a letter Wednesday urging the prime minister to back a plan written by a group of generals that calls for a full Israeli takeover of northern Gaza in order to put real pressure on Hamas and win the war. The 27 ministers and Coalition members have asked Benjamin Netanyahu to convene the security cabinet and adopt the 'Generals’ Plan' that had been presented to the public by the Commanders and Reserve Soldiers Forum a few weeks ago. 'The recent cabinet decision regarding the permanent presence of our soldiers in the Philadelphi Corridor requires, in our opinion, a strategic complement with another action,' they wrote. The Generals’ Plan was written by respected reserve IDF commanders, including Generals Giora Eiland (former national security adviser and ex-head of IDF Operations), Gershon Hacohen (former commander of the IDF military colleges) and Avi Mizrachi (ex-head of Central Command). The proposal says that the approximately 300,000 Palestinian residents in the northern section of the Strip, including Gaza City and its environs, should be given a week’s warning to evacuate along two humanitarian corridors secured by the IDF. This is about 40% of the coastal enclave, and has been surrounded by the IDF for many months already. It would be declared a closed military zone, Eiland said in an explanatory video released earlier this month, and 'nothing would be allowed in.' The result would be that 'The 5,000 Hamas fighters in this area can then either decide to surrender or die of starvation.' If they decide to fight instead, the IDF would be able to deal with them. Losing the whole north, Eiland noted, 'will create real pressure' on Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, 'who will understand that what happened [there] can happen later, whether in Rafah or other places' in Gaza. Another part of the plan is for the army to take over all food and aid distribution to the civilian population instead of the current situation in which Hamas confiscates it all by force, both for its own use and to enrich itself to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by selling what had been donated for free in order to keep Gazans from supposed starvation. As the MKs’ letter stated, Hamas’ control of the humanitarian aid 'gives it full control over the population [and] over the recruitment of fighters, in addition to strengthening its fighting forces and bringing in enormous economic profit.' In recapping the main points of the plan, those who signed the letter stated that they believe, as these generals do, that these are the steps that will enable the government to finally achieve its stated war goals of rescuing the hostages, destroying Hamas’ ability to govern, and ensuring that Gaza will not threaten Israel in the future.

Rosh Hashanah bombing targeted former Israeli defense minister	Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah attempted to assassinate former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon in failed Rosh Hashanah bombing attack in Tel Aviv. By World Israel News Staff A terrorist cell operated by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah organization in Lebanon attempted to assassinate a former Israeli Defense Minister and ex-IDF chief of staff in a bombing attack during the Rosh Hashanah holiday last year, Israeli police revealed on Wednesday. The plot targeted Moshe Ya'alon, chief of the IDF General Staff from 2002 to 2005, who later entered politics on the Likud ticket, serving as Defense Minister before bolting the party and joining Benny Gantz's Blue and White. According to police, Hezbollah terrorists operating out of Lebanon directed a nine-member terrorist cell inside of Israel, made up of eight Arab-Israelis and controlled by a single Lebanese handler. The nine cell members were originally enlisted by their Hezbollah handler for weapons smuggling last summer. According to the investigation, conducted by Israel Police and the Shin Bet internal security agency, the cell members were initially told they would be smuggling drugs into Israel from Lebanon. Communicating with their Hezbollah handler via the Whatsapp social media platform, two cell members collected nine packages from a designated collection point along the border barrier. Later, however, the two cell members found that the packages contained weapons, rather than drugs. The weapons included rifles, pistols, and anti-personnel mines. On August 31st, Hezbollah instructed the cell to purchase remote-control cameras, with one cell member ordered to leave his vehicle parked at Tel Aviv's Hayarkon Park. On September 1st, a member of the cell assembled a makeshift bomb using the anti-personnel mine and the remote-control cameras, with the goal of enabling the cell to watch a live feed of the bomb, waiting for the target to approach before remotely detonating it. Eleven days later, three days before the planned bombing, the device was retrieved from a hiding place and brought to Tel Aviv. On September 15th, the bomb detonated prematurely at 6:30 a.m., forcing one of the cell members to flee to the Beit Hanina neighborhood in Jerusalem with the aid of a second cell member. Both cell members were arrested en route to Jerusalem later that day, with six others arrested during the subsequent investigation. According to the Shin Bet and Israel Police and based on interrogations of the suspects, the cell members had planned to kill Ya'alon during his daily jog through Hayarkon Park on the eve of the Rosh Hashanah holiday. All eight of the arrested suspects have been indicted on terror charges, while the ninth member of the has been charge in absentia.

Gazans beginning to regret October 7th invasion – poll	Only 39% still back the decision to attack Israel on October 7, while PA Arabs sharply differ, with 64% standing behind it. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A Palestinian poll published Tuesday shows that for the first time in nearly a year of fighting, only a minority of Gazans still support Hamas’ October 7th invasion of Israel. The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) survey showed that only 39% still backed the invasion, a massive drop of 18 percentage points from the last survey three months ago. Among Palestinian Authority (PA) Arabs, the decision to attack still enjoys 64% support, although this number reflects a drop of 13 points since the last poll, conducted in June. Taken together, a slight majority of 53% still say that Hamas was correct to invade. The PCPSR noted that this support 'does not necessarily mean support for Hamas and does not mean support for any killings or atrocities committed against civilians,' citing the statistic that almost 90% of the public does not believe that Hamas forces committed 'the atrocities depicted in videos taken on that day.' Instead, Palestinians back the attack because they believe that it 'put the Palestinian issue at the center of attention and eliminated years of neglect at the regional and international levels,' the Center said. This does not necessarily translate to an expectation that Hamas will win the war against Israel, although again there is a sharp dichotomy between the Gazans who are experiencing it, and PA Arabs who are not. While in June the conviction that Hamas would ultimately be victorious was split almost evenly among Gazans, with 48% believing this was true, the latest poll shows a hard drop to 28%. PA Arabs are much more optimistic, with 65% saying Hamas would win, although this does reflect a drop of 14 points from the last poll. The contrast continued with the question of who will control Gaza after the war, with 37% of Strip residents (down from 46%) and fully 70% of PA Arabs saying Hamas will continue to rule the coastal enclave. When asked whom they prefer to govern them, similar numbers said Hamas, while overall 20% chose the PA, 12% preferred international forces, and four percent said the IDF. The survey also asked respondents to grade their satisfaction with how regional actors are supporting them. Yemen came first by a large margin with 69%, most probably on the basis of the missile attacks on Israel by the country’s Houthi terrorists. Hezbollah, which has launched some 8,000 rockets, UAV and other airborne threats at Israel since October 8 to support Hamas, came in second, at 44%. Qatar, which has supported Hamas with billions of dollars over the years and is now acting as a mediator in negotiations for a hostages-for-ceasefire deal, was a close third at 43%. Iran only received an approving nod from 33%, which is a 16-point drop from June. This, said the polling agency, 'seems to be due to the belief of the overwhelming majority (76%) that it will not retaliate for the assassination of [Hamas political head] Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.' Armed struggle was considered the most effective way to gain a state by 48%, a drop of six points from June. The three-month drop was extremely sharp in Gaza, however – a whopping 20 points. Negotiations were a distant second at 30%, although this represented a five point rise. The PCPSR said it conducted its survey by telephone or tablet in areas of the Gaza Strip where there was no fighting currently going on, but noted that it excluded the quiet northern section due to technical difficulties. In all, 1,200 people were surveyed, 790 in the PA and 410 in Gaza. The margin of error was 3.5%.

‘Use it or lose it’ – Israel forced to use mass pager attack pree...	Hezbollah terrorists were reportedly close to uncovering Israel's modifications to the terror group's pagers, forcing Israel to preemptively use the mass attack. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's attack on thousands of Hezbollah terrorists across Lebanon and Syria Tuesday had originally been planned to take place only in the event of a full-scale war on the Israel-Lebanon border, three U.S. officials claim, and was only carried out amid concerns the terror group was close to revealing Israel's modifications to the electronic beepers used in the attack. On Tuesday, thousands of pager devices issued to Hezbollah operatives and associates detonated en masse, killing eleven and injuring roughly 4,000. The devices reportedly exploded as part of a large-scale attack conducted by Israel's Mossad, which is claimed to have implanted miniature explosive devices in the Hezbollah pagers five months ago, prior to their delivery to Lebanon. However, according to three U.S. officials cited in a report by Axios Wednesday, the pager attack had been held in reserve by Israel, and was slated for use only if a full-scale war broke out between Israel and Hezbollah. Recently, however, Israeli intel officials came to believe that the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group was close to discovering the modifications to the pagers, forcing Israel to either activate the devices immediately, or lose its capability. 'It was a use it or lose it moment,' one U.S. official explained, saying that Israel had informed the U.S. of its reasoning for the timing of Tuesday's attack. According to a former Israeli official cited by Axios, the operation had been planned as an opening salvo in a potential full-scale war with Hezbollah, crippling the terror group's leadership and sowing chaos in its ranks at the outset of the war. A separate report by Al-Monitor claimed that two Hezbollah terrorists had recently raised concerns regarding the group's pagers over the past few days, sparking fears in Israel's intelligence community the explosive devices were on the verge of discovery.

Iranian ambassador blinded by Hezbollah beeper blast – report	Iranian ambassador's injuries prove clear link between Iran and the Hezbollah terror group. By World Israel News Staff Iran's ambassador to Lebanon was seriously wounded during the coordinated explosion of beepers used by Hezbollah members on Tuesday, with international media reports indicating that he was left blinded by the blast. According to a New York Times report, Ambassador Mojtaba Amani lost one eye in the explosion. His surviving eye was seriously damaged, leaving him with extremely limited vision. In a brief statement on Tuesday, the Iranian government admitted that Amani was wounded in the incident, but downplayed the severity of his injuries and said he was 'in good general condition' after being treated at a hospital. That false narrative was repeated by Amani's wife, Narges Ghadirian, who wrote on X that her husband was 'slightly injured, but thank God he is all right and the danger has passed.' Some unconfirmed reports are reporting that the Iran ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani has been injured in his eyes after checking his beeper potentially making him blind. We will confirm as we know. pic.twitter.com/biXkeE192I &mdash; Open Source Intel (@Osint613) September 17, 2024 Hossein Soleimani, who heads the IRGC's news website Mashregh, confirmed on X that Amani had been seriously wounded, several hours after the blasts. 'Unfortunately the injuries sustained by Iran’s ambassador were extremely severe and in his eyes,' Soleimani wrote. Tehran is planning to repatriate Amani on an emergency flight for additional medical care at a hospital in Iran. The fact that Amani was in possession of a beeper that exploded demonstrates the deep ties between Iran and the Hezbollah terror group. Two members of the IRGC confirmed to the New York Times that the beepers were only used by Hezbollah operatives and members. Iran is a long-time patron of Hezbollah, providing them with training, funding, and weapons for use against Israel. But Iran has often claimed that Hezbollah is not their proxy group, characterizing them as an Islamic resistance organization fighting for Lebanon, rather than at the behest of Tehran. Lebanon and Iran have blamed Israel for the explosions, which killed at least 9 people and injured some 3,000 more. Israel has refused to comment on the incident.

Mossad planted explosives in Hezbollah’s beepers 5 months ago, de...	On Tuesday, at least eleven were killed, and 4,000 people were wounded in Lebanon when beepers exploded simultaneously. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News According to Sky News Arabia, sources report that Mossad ensured explosives were implanted into the pagers and heated them remotely, causing them to detonate. On Tuesday, at least 11 were killed, and 4,000 people were wounded in Lebanon when beepers exploded simultaneously. Most of those killed or injured were Hezbollah terrorists. The report indicates that PETN, a highly explosive material, was implanted in the batteries of the beepers. The weight of the PETN explosives was less than 20 grams, and it is believed they were obtained and implanted 5 months ago. This was possible only through close cooperation with the manufacturer, who must have consented to the supply chain disruption. In an interview with Ma'ariv, Oleg Brodt, Director of Research, Development, and Innovation at Ben-Gurion University's Cyber Labs, explained, 'Many attacks occur by compromising the supply chain. Like a beeper, an electronic device contains numerous components, and each could be infected with malware.' He added, 'This malware could be designed to raise the device’s temperature, cause a malfunction, ignite it, or even trigger an explosion.' Brodt explained, 'In such cases, it’s essential to make the changes to the device without raising suspicion during the quality inspection.' Once implanted on the batteries of the beeper, the explosives were detonated by heating them up remotely. This might have been done using a 'kill switch,' as it is called in the cyber world. The kill switch is software designed to detonate a device at a certain time. It can be set off using a code word or even gibberish. 'It’s possible to set up a non-standard message—something unusual or even gibberish—broadcast to hundreds or thousands of devices simultaneously, causing simultaneous ignition and explosion,' Brodt explained. 'The radio waves the device receives are translated into a unique message that triggers a chain of events leading to the explosion.'

A Reuters journalist saw 10 terrorists bleeding from injuries in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiya, a main stronghold of Hezbollah. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS More than 4,000 Hezbollah terrorists were wounded and at least eleven were killed across Lebanon on Tuesday when their communication devices exploded, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad confirmed. Approximately 200 Hezbollah terrorists were in critical condition in 100 different hospitals, Beirut’s health minister announced about three hours after the explosions were first reported at 3.30 p.m. local time. A Reuters journalist saw 10 terrorists bleeding from injuries in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiya, which is the main stronghold of Hezbollah. A security source told Qatar’s Al Jazeera that explosions occurred across Lebanon—not only in Beirut but also in the Beqaa Valley and the south. Senior Hezbollah officials were said to have been wounded in the blasts. Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also wounded in one of the explosions, Tehran’s semi-official Mehr outlet reported.

In its first official statement on the incident, Hezbollah announced that the pager explosions, 'the causes of which are still unknown,' killed at least three of its members, while wounding a large number of others. Shortly thereafter, the terrorist organization issued a statement that it held the Jewish state 'fully responsible for this criminal aggression.' Lebanese media affiliated with Hezbollah had attributed the incident to the Israel Defense Forces, claiming the mysterious blasts were caused by a hack of the terrorist group’s internal communications networks. The Wall Street Journal said the pagers were part of a new shipment that the terror group received in recent days. A Hezbollah official suggested that 'malware' may have caused the pagers to heat up and explode. Another Hezbollah terrorist official in Lebanon cited by Reuters called the alleged computer hack by Israel the 'biggest security breach so far.' The IDF declined to comment on the incident, which came just hours after the Israeli Cabinet added the return of citizens displaced from their homes in the north to the country’s war goals, bringing a potential major confrontation with Hezbollah closer to reality.

By JNS An Israeli aerial strike on Monday killed the head of Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s rocket and missile unit in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. Ahmed Aish Salame al-Hashash was embedded and operating inside the humanitarian zone in Khan Yunis when he was eliminated in the precision attack, according to the Israel Defense Forces. 'Al-Hashash was responsible for the Islamic Jihad’s rocket attacks in the Rafah Brigade and was an important source of knowledge […] within the Islamic Jihad terror organization in Gaza,' the IDF said.

'The terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip continue to systematically abuse civilian and humanitarian infrastructure to carry out terrorist activities and attacks on Israeli civilians,' the IDF statement concluded. 'The IDF will continue to operate against the terrorist organizations in defense of the State of Israel.' Soldier seriously wounded A reserve soldier in the IDF’s 846th Battalion, Givati Brigade, was seriously wounded during combat operations in the southern Gaza Strip, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said on Tuesday morning. He was evacuated to a hospital for treatment and his family was notified. IDF’s 5th Brigade deployed to Gaza’s Netzarim Corridor The Israel Defense Forces’ 5th Infantry Brigade has been stationed in the Netzarim Corridor that splits the Gaza Strip between north and south, the army announced on Monday. It is the second time the brigade has operated in the coastal enclave since Israeli forces entered the territory on Oct. 27. The brigade’s first tour of duty entailed protecting Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip in the first days of the war and ridding them of terrorists, before months of combat in the areas of Beit Hanun, Kherbat Ahzaa and the central corridor. The brigade falls under the command of the 252nd Division, which in recent months has been operating against Hamas and working to expand the axis dividing the northern and southern Strip. 'In the last few days, the brigade’s fighters completed a series of training and exercises at the Ground Forces Training Center (GTC). The forces carried out training and exercises in warfare in open and built-up areas and raised their operational competence in preparation for their mission in the center of the Gaza Strip,' the IDF said. 'In addition, the forces completed logistical preparation and held mobility, supplies and immediate medical response training in preparation for the fighting.'

Hezbollah plot to assassinate former Israeli security chief foile...	The Lebanese terror group had planned to bomb a former Israeli security official using a Claymore mine. By World Israel News Staff The Iran-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah plotted to assassinate a former senior Israeli security official using an anti-personnel mine, the Shin Bet internal security agency revealed Tuesday. The Shin Bet announced Tuesday afternoon that a former senior Israeli security official, whose identity remains barred from publication, was to have been targeted by Hezbollah terrorists in the next few days, using a remotely-detonated Claymore mine. 'As part of an operation by the General Security Service, a bomb attack on behalf of Hezbollah was foiled, which was targeted against a former senior official in the security system and was planned to be carried out in the coming days,' the Shin Bet said. According to the Shin Bet, the explosive device was linked to a cellular phone, allowing the bomb's handlers in Lebanon to observe when the target approached the mine and then detonate it remotely. The bomb was similar to another explosive device found in Hayarkon Park last September, planted as part of another Hezbollah plot to kill an Israeli official. Shin Bet officials believe that the same Hezbollah cell is behind both failed bombing attempts. 'Operational preparation and the activity of the forces prevented the attack in the final stages of implementation,' the Shin Bet said. 'The target of the attack has been updated by the security forces and is being updated accordingly.' 'The Shin Bet, together with its partners in the security system, will increase and operate with all the capabilities available to it to monitor and thwart Hezbollah's terrorist activities.' Six months before the Hayarkon Park bombing attempt, Hezbollah terrorists infiltrated into northern Israel and placed a bomb near Megiddo Junction, seirously injuring the driver of a passing vehicle.

Blinken heads to Egypt for talks on Israeli control of Philadelph...	Most of the holdup in a potential hostage deal allegedly centers around control of the Gaza-Egypt border, which has been Hamas’ weapons pipeline and is now in Israel’s hands. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is coming to Egypt Tuesday to hold discussions on the one of the main issues holding up a hostage deal with Hamas – control over the Philadelphi Corridor, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Citing 'an official in the region,' the report said that Blinken’s trip is being made 'to reassure Israel over its concerns that Hamas can smuggle weapons across' the Egyptian-Gazan border, which the IDF and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have called Hamas’ oxygen pipeline in terms of military resupply. Since taking the Corridor over several months ago, the Israeli army has discovered – and blown up – dozens of smuggling tunnels running from the Egyptian side into the Gazan city of Rafah, some large enough for trucks that can carry missiles as well as tons of cement for terror tunnel construction. Netanyahu has declared that Israel must control this nine-mile-long line or else Hamas will easily rearm, rebuild, and become a new 'existential' threat to the Jewish state within a few years’ time. Most of the Israeli public agrees that holding the Corridor is of utmost importance to Israel's security. Hamas refuses to sign off on a hostages-for-ceasefire-and-prisoners agreement unless the IDF withdraws, both from the southern line and the Netzarim Corridor that the army built in central Gaza that stretches to the Mediterranean Sea in order to cut the Strip in half. Although Cairo is considered by the U.S. to be a faithful mediator in the hostage talks, it has sided with Hamas in strenuously opposing an Israeli presence on its border with Gaza. Egypt has not acknowledged its total failure to prevent the wholesale Palestinian smuggling that is considered the main reason Hamas could become a major and immediate security threat to Israel, as it proved on October 7, when the terrorist organization led an invasion in which they and other Gazans massacred 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians. The paper pointed out that Blinken’s visit follows last week’s announcement that the U.S. would be providing Egypt with its full annual military aid package of $1.3 billion, overruling a Congressional directive that conditioned some of the funding on Cairo improving its human rights record, which is still considered deplorable by experts in the field. A State Department spokesperson said that the decision to restore the last $320 million of the package was 'important to advancing regional peace and Egypt’s specific and ongoing contributions to U.S. national security priorities, particularly to finalize a ceasefire agreement for Gaza' and help end the Israel-Hamas war. It is unknown whether Blinken will tie the Americans’ generosity to a request that Egypt soften its stance on the Philadelphi Corridor and persuade Hamas to do so as well, in order to get a deal done that will see the release of at least some of the live hostages still remaining in Hamas captivity over 11 months after they were abducted. President Joe Biden has repeatedly stated that freeing the hostages remains one of his top priorities. The ceasefire that would be part of the deal would also seemingly stop a possible Israel-Hezbollah war, as the Lebanese Shiite terrorists have said they would stop their constant rocket attacks on Israel if the fighting stops in Gaza. Jerusalem has made increasingly threatening noises in recent days to restore quiet in its northern region by invading Lebanon to push Hezbollah away from the border, as 60,000 Israelis are still evacuated from their homes for their safety, an untenable position for any government. Blinken’s trip to Cairo is in accord with the U.S. position that diplomatic means can prevent such a war, which it fears could turn into a wider, regional conflict that includes Hezbollah’s master, Iran.

Houthi terrorists preparing for ground invasion of Israel: Report	Journalist warns that Houthi ground forces are preparing to invade Israel, via Syrian or Jordanian borders. By World Israel News Staff Houthi terrorists may be gearing up for a ground invasion of Israel, despite their origin in Yemen some 2,000 kilometers away (1,240 miles), warned an Israeli analyst in a Hebrew-language column on Monday. Haggai Huberman, a journalist and political commentator, argued that Israeli defense officials should prepare for the 'real' threat of infiltration by Houthi fighters. 'The security establishment should understand that the Houthis are seriously aiming to carry out a ground attack against Israel, also as part of their response to Israel's attack on the port of Al Hudaydah,' Huberman wrote in a report for Arutz Sheva. Huberman explained that in recent months, Houthi terrorists have traveled from Yemen to Syria and Jordan, which both share a border with Israel. Disguised as civilians, some 50 Houthis were said to have reached Iraq in August. They were then were smuggled over the Syrian border by pro-Iran militias, according to his report in Arutz Sheva. These operatives reportedly are trained to launch missiles and operate explosive drones, and may be gearing up to launch a limited ground invasion of Israel from Syria or Lebanon. Later in August, Hebrew-language media reported that Jordan secretly warned Israel that dozens of Houthis had landed in Amman, and were planning to infiltrate the Jewish State via its eastern border. The Houthi's ground forces in Yemen consist of tens of thousands of fighters, who have battle experience from fighting in Yemen's civil war and against Saudi Arabia in the country. Notably, the Houthis have released videos demonstrating their fighters engaging in exercises that evoke the October 7th massacres, including invading Israelis army bases, rampaging through civilian villages, and taking hostages. The videos were accompanied by a caption explaining that the Houthis are preparing for a 'war of victory and holy jihad' against the Jewish State. 'We must be prepared and not be surprised again, as we were on October 7, 2023,' Huberman concluded.

Number of Hezbollah terrorists killed or wounded by beepers likel...	The estimation is that there are many dozens of dead, if not more.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Although the official number indicates that a dozen Hezbollah terrorists have been killed over the last two days by exploding pagers, it is most likely higher than what has been reported. Ronen Bergman, who writes for the New York Times and Yediot Ahronoth, says the number of people killed by the beeper explosions is higher than the reported 12 yesterday and 14 today. 'The estimation is that there are many dozens of dead, if not more,' he said. In addition, the mission caused massive damage to Hezbollah's Radwan unit, which has lost much of its leadership. Israel has not commented on the deadly explosions, which are widely attributed to Israel. The offensive on Tuesday involved the spontaneous explosion of thousands of beepers used by Hezbollah terrorists, wounding thousands and killing over a dozen, according to reports. Additional injuries and deaths occurred on Wednesday in Lebanon and in Syria, where 19 IRGC terrorists were killed and 150 were injured. A former commander of British military forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, praised the beeper offensive against Hezbollah as 'precise and discriminatory' and effective at weakening the morale and capacity of the Lebanese terror group. Israel’s outsmarting them with this terror attack has led to Hezbollah’s 'demoralization.' Kemp also praised the mission because it effectively targeted only terrorists and limited civilian casualties. 'It’s hard to think of a more precise and discriminating method of attack than detonating pagers known to be specifically assigned to individual terrorists, using devices that limit the potential for collateral damage.' He added that the exploding beepers were intended only for terrorists who are 'legitimate and lawful targets for attack as Israel seeks to defend its citizens from violent aggression,' he said. Kemp added that three distinctive characteristics of the mission made it particularly effective. First, the mission resulted in extensive damage to Hezbollah, second it engendered anxiety in Hezbollah members and may discourage others from joining and third, it has humiliated Hezbollah on the world stage.

Exploding beepers were intended only for terrorists who are 'legitimate and lawful targets for attack as Israel seeks to defend its citizens from violent aggression.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The former commander of British military forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, praised the beeper offensive against Hezbollah as 'precise and discriminatory' and effective at weakening the morale and capacity of the Lebanese terror group. The offensive on Tuesday involved the spontaneous explosion of thousands of beepers used by Hezbollah terrorists, wounding thousands and killing over a dozen. Additional injuries and deaths occurred on Wednesday in Lebanon and in Syria, where 19 IRGC terrorists were killed and 150 were injured. Kemp told Israel National News that three salient factors make the beeper mission uniquely effective. 'First, it will have done immense damage to the terrorist organization, taking a large number of its fighters and leaders out in one go. Plus, of course, it severely undermines their communications capability,' Kemp said. He added, 'Second, it will have intimidated Hezbollah, potentially frightening some members into leaving the group or scaring off recruits from joining.' Kemp explained, 'The psychological impact will be enormous, with every Hezbollah terrorist now fearing that almost everything he owns or touches, including cars, guns, laptops, radios, and other electrical items, could potentially be weaponized against them.' He added the constant anxiety Hezbollah members may feel now is a 'far cry from the supposed glory of battlefield martyrdom they were promised.' In addition, Hezbollah may retreat from the notion of a full-scale offensive against Israel since now they realize their terror group operations and technology have been infiltrated. 'Third, it has humiliated Hezbollah, a terrorist organization that struts its power on the world stage, presenting itself as one of the strongest armies in the Middle East.' Israel's outsmarting them with this terror attack has led to Hezbollah's 'demoralization.' Kemp also praised the mission because it effectively targeted only terrorists and limited civilian casualties. 'It’s hard to think of a more precise and discriminating method of attack than detonating pagers known to be specifically assigned to individual terrorists, using devices that limit the potential for collateral damage.'

More Hezbollah comms devices explode across Lebanon, killing 14	At least one of the blasts took place in the vicinity of a funeral for terrorists killed on Tuesday. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS More communications devices used by Hezbollah terrorists exploded on Wednesday afternoon across the group’s main stronghold in Beirut and in Southern Lebanon, Reuters reported, citing a security source. According to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, at least fourteen Hezbollah operatives were killed in the latest series of device explosions. In addition, some 400 terrorists were said to have sustained wounds. At least one of the blasts took place in the vicinity of a funeral for terrorists killed on Tuesday, when thousands of Hezbollah pagers detonated all over the country, according to eyewitness reports. The Hezbollah devices that exploded late Wednesday afternoon are hand-held walkie-talkies, a Lebanese security source told Reuters. Axios cited sources familiar with the matter as saying that the radios, which were booby-trapped in advance by Israeli intelligence, were part of the terror group’s emergency communications systems that were supposed to be used during a conflict with the Israel Defense Forces. תיעוד | פיצוץ מכשיר בביירות בזמן הלווית אחד ממחבלי חזבאללה שחוסלו אתמול@Doron_Kadosh pic.twitter.com/rT6dlmutpb &mdash; גלצ (@GLZRadio) September 18, 2024 On Tuesday, more than 2,700 Hezbollah operatives were wounded and at least 12 were killed across Lebanon when their pagers exploded, with the terrorist organization saying it held Israel 'fully responsible.' Speaking at a Wednesday funeral for several of the terrorists killed the day prior, Hezbollah executive council head Hashem Safieddine vowed a 'bloodily unique revenge' against the Jewish state, local reports said. 'Tomorrow, the leader of Hezbollah will speak and all will be revealed,' Safieddine said. 'We will be in a new situation and a new confrontation with this enemy.' The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on Tuesday’s incident, which came just hours after the Israeli Cabinet added the return of citizens displaced from their homes in the north to the country’s war goals, bringing a potential major clash with Hezbollah closer to reality. Iran-backed Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones. The attacks have so far killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage. Tens of thousands of civilians remain internally displaced due to the violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein this week that displaced Israelis will not be able to return home without strong military or diplomatic action against Hezbollah. Netanyahu 'made it very clear that it will not be possible to return our residents without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north,' Netanyahu’s office stated after a Monday meeting in Tel Aviv. Jerusalem will 'ultimately do what is necessary to safeguard its security and return the residents of the north securely to their homes,' he vowed.

19 Iranian soldiers killed, 150 injured in pager bombings, Israel...	Israel's pager bombing attack on Hezbollah also impacted Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces in Syria, killing 19 and wounding 150. By World Israel News Staff At least 19 soldiers in Iran's paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed and roughly 150 more were injured in pager explosions in eastern Syria, according to Arabic media reports Wednesday. On Tuesday, thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah operatives across Lebanon detonated simultaneously in a mass attack attributed to Israel. Eleven people were killed and roughly 4,000 injured in the explosions in Lebanon. According to a report by the Saudi-based Al Hadath outlet on Wednesday, however, the pager bombings also killed 19 members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps stationed in the Deir Ez-Zur province of eastern Syria. In addition, some 150 other Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps members were injured, Al Hadath reported. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was among those injured in the attack, reportedly being completely blinded in one eye and partially blinded in the other. While Iran initially downplayed the severity of his injuries, The New York Times reported that not only was Amani blinded, but that he lost one eye in the attack, while the other was seriously damaged, leaving him with extremely limited vision. Hossein Soleimani, who heads the IRGC’s news website Mashregh, confirmed on X that Amani had been seriously wounded, several hours after the blasts. 'Unfortunately the injuries sustained by Iran’s ambassador were extremely severe and in his eyes,' Soleimani wrote, acknowledging the severity of Amani's injuries. Some 500 Hezbollah operatives were also blinded, either partially or entirely, as a result of the pager explosions, Al Hadath reported. Media reports after Tuesday’s attack implicated Israel’s Mossad, amid claims its agents implanted miniature explosive devices inside a shipment of thousands of pagers bound for Lebanon’s Hezbollah five months ago. Israel is widely believed to be behind the operation but remains silent and has not acknowledged responsibility.

Dozens of Israeli ministers and Coalition MKs demand Israeli take...	The 27 coalition members urged the prime minister to adopt the 'Generals’ Plan' of a group of generals designed to put real pressure on Hamas. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Dozens of MKs and ministers from the coalition wrote a letter Wednesday urging the prime minister to back a plan written by a group of generals that calls for a full Israeli takeover of northern Gaza in order to put real pressure on Hamas and win the war. The 27 ministers and Coalition members have asked Benjamin Netanyahu to convene the security cabinet and adopt the 'Generals’ Plan' that had been presented to the public by the Commanders and Reserve Soldiers Forum a few weeks ago. 'The recent cabinet decision regarding the permanent presence of our soldiers in the Philadelphi Corridor requires, in our opinion, a strategic complement with another action,' they wrote. The Generals’ Plan was written by respected reserve IDF commanders, including Generals Giora Eiland (former national security adviser and ex-head of IDF Operations), Gershon Hacohen (former commander of the IDF military colleges) and Avi Mizrachi (ex-head of Central Command). The proposal says that the approximately 300,000 Palestinian residents in the northern section of the Strip, including Gaza City and its environs, should be given a week’s warning to evacuate along two humanitarian corridors secured by the IDF. This is about 40% of the coastal enclave, and has been surrounded by the IDF for many months already. It would be declared a closed military zone, Eiland said in an explanatory video released earlier this month, and 'nothing would be allowed in.' The result would be that 'The 5,000 Hamas fighters in this area can then either decide to surrender or die of starvation.' If they decide to fight instead, the IDF would be able to deal with them. Losing the whole north, Eiland noted, 'will create real pressure' on Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, 'who will understand that what happened [there] can happen later, whether in Rafah or other places' in Gaza. Another part of the plan is for the army to take over all food and aid distribution to the civilian population instead of the current situation in which Hamas confiscates it all by force, both for its own use and to enrich itself to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by selling what had been donated for free in order to keep Gazans from supposed starvation. As the MKs’ letter stated, Hamas’ control of the humanitarian aid 'gives it full control over the population [and] over the recruitment of fighters, in addition to strengthening its fighting forces and bringing in enormous economic profit.' In recapping the main points of the plan, those who signed the letter stated that they believe, as these generals do, that these are the steps that will enable the government to finally achieve its stated war goals of rescuing the hostages, destroying Hamas’ ability to govern, and ensuring that Gaza will not threaten Israel in the future.

Rosh Hashanah bombing targeted former Israeli defense minister	Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah attempted to assassinate former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon in failed Rosh Hashanah bombing attack in Tel Aviv. By World Israel News Staff A terrorist cell operated by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah organization in Lebanon attempted to assassinate a former Israeli Defense Minister and ex-IDF chief of staff in a bombing attack during the Rosh Hashanah holiday last year, Israeli police revealed on Wednesday. The plot targeted Moshe Ya'alon, chief of the IDF General Staff from 2002 to 2005, who later entered politics on the Likud ticket, serving as Defense Minister before bolting the party and joining Benny Gantz's Blue and White. According to police, Hezbollah terrorists operating out of Lebanon directed a nine-member terrorist cell inside of Israel, made up of eight Arab-Israelis and controlled by a single Lebanese handler. The nine cell members were originally enlisted by their Hezbollah handler for weapons smuggling last summer. According to the investigation, conducted by Israel Police and the Shin Bet internal security agency, the cell members were initially told they would be smuggling drugs into Israel from Lebanon. Communicating with their Hezbollah handler via the Whatsapp social media platform, two cell members collected nine packages from a designated collection point along the border barrier. Later, however, the two cell members found that the packages contained weapons, rather than drugs. The weapons included rifles, pistols, and anti-personnel mines. On August 31st, Hezbollah instructed the cell to purchase remote-control cameras, with one cell member ordered to leave his vehicle parked at Tel Aviv's Hayarkon Park. On September 1st, a member of the cell assembled a makeshift bomb using the anti-personnel mine and the remote-control cameras, with the goal of enabling the cell to watch a live feed of the bomb, waiting for the target to approach before remotely detonating it. Eleven days later, three days before the planned bombing, the device was retrieved from a hiding place and brought to Tel Aviv. On September 15th, the bomb detonated prematurely at 6:30 a.m., forcing one of the cell members to flee to the Beit Hanina neighborhood in Jerusalem with the aid of a second cell member. Both cell members were arrested en route to Jerusalem later that day, with six others arrested during the subsequent investigation. According to the Shin Bet and Israel Police and based on interrogations of the suspects, the cell members had planned to kill Ya'alon during his daily jog through Hayarkon Park on the eve of the Rosh Hashanah holiday. All eight of the arrested suspects have been indicted on terror charges, while the ninth member of the has been charge in absentia.

By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A Palestinian poll published Tuesday shows that for the first time in nearly a year of fighting, only a minority of Gazans still support Hamas’ October 7th invasion of Israel. The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) survey showed that only 39% still backed the invasion, a massive drop of 18 percentage points from the last survey three months ago. Among Palestinian Authority (PA) Arabs, the decision to attack still enjoys 64% support, although this number reflects a drop of 13 points since the last poll, conducted in June. Taken together, a slight majority of 53% still say that Hamas was correct to invade. The PCPSR noted that this support 'does not necessarily mean support for Hamas and does not mean support for any killings or atrocities committed against civilians,' citing the statistic that almost 90% of the public does not believe that Hamas forces committed 'the atrocities depicted in videos taken on that day.' Instead, Palestinians back the attack because they believe that it 'put the Palestinian issue at the center of attention and eliminated years of neglect at the regional and international levels,' the Center said. This does not necessarily translate to an expectation that Hamas will win the war against Israel, although again there is a sharp dichotomy between the Gazans who are experiencing it, and PA Arabs who are not. While in June the conviction that Hamas would ultimately be victorious was split almost evenly among Gazans, with 48% believing this was true, the latest poll shows a hard drop to 28%. PA Arabs are much more optimistic, with 65% saying Hamas would win, although this does reflect a drop of 14 points from the last poll. The contrast continued with the question of who will control Gaza after the war, with 37% of Strip residents (down from 46%) and fully 70% of PA Arabs saying Hamas will continue to rule the coastal enclave. When asked whom they prefer to govern them, similar numbers said Hamas, while overall 20% chose the PA, 12% preferred international forces, and four percent said the IDF. The survey also asked respondents to grade their satisfaction with how regional actors are supporting them. Yemen came first by a large margin with 69%, most probably on the basis of the missile attacks on Israel by the country’s Houthi terrorists. Hezbollah, which has launched some 8,000 rockets, UAV and other airborne threats at Israel since October 8 to support Hamas, came in second, at 44%. Qatar, which has supported Hamas with billions of dollars over the years and is now acting as a mediator in negotiations for a hostages-for-ceasefire deal, was a close third at 43%. Iran only received an approving nod from 33%, which is a 16-point drop from June. This, said the polling agency, 'seems to be due to the belief of the overwhelming majority (76%) that it will not retaliate for the assassination of [Hamas political head] Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.' Armed struggle was considered the most effective way to gain a state by 48%, a drop of six points from June. The three-month drop was extremely sharp in Gaza, however – a whopping 20 points. Negotiations were a distant second at 30%, although this represented a five point rise. The PCPSR said it conducted its survey by telephone or tablet in areas of the Gaza Strip where there was no fighting currently going on, but noted that it excluded the quiet northern section due to technical difficulties. In all, 1,200 people were surveyed, 790 in the PA and 410 in Gaza. The margin of error was 3.5%.

‘Use it or lose it’ – Israel forced to use mass pager attack pree...	Hezbollah terrorists were reportedly close to uncovering Israel's modifications to the terror group's pagers, forcing Israel to preemptively use the mass attack. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's attack on thousands of Hezbollah terrorists across Lebanon and Syria Tuesday had originally been planned to take place only in the event of a full-scale war on the Israel-Lebanon border, three U.S. officials claim, and was only carried out amid concerns the terror group was close to revealing Israel's modifications to the electronic beepers used in the attack. On Tuesday, thousands of pager devices issued to Hezbollah operatives and associates detonated en masse, killing eleven and injuring roughly 4,000. The devices reportedly exploded as part of a large-scale attack conducted by Israel's Mossad, which is claimed to have implanted miniature explosive devices in the Hezbollah pagers five months ago, prior to their delivery to Lebanon. However, according to three U.S. officials cited in a report by Axios Wednesday, the pager attack had been held in reserve by Israel, and was slated for use only if a full-scale war broke out between Israel and Hezbollah. Recently, however, Israeli intel officials came to believe that the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group was close to discovering the modifications to the pagers, forcing Israel to either activate the devices immediately, or lose its capability. 'It was a use it or lose it moment,' one U.S. official explained, saying that Israel had informed the U.S. of its reasoning for the timing of Tuesday's attack. According to a former Israeli official cited by Axios, the operation had been planned as an opening salvo in a potential full-scale war with Hezbollah, crippling the terror group's leadership and sowing chaos in its ranks at the outset of the war. A separate report by Al-Monitor claimed that two Hezbollah terrorists had recently raised concerns regarding the group's pagers over the past few days, sparking fears in Israel's intelligence community the explosive devices were on the verge of discovery.

Iranian ambassador blinded by Hezbollah beeper blast – report	Iranian ambassador's injuries prove clear link between Iran and the Hezbollah terror group. By World Israel News Staff Iran's ambassador to Lebanon was seriously wounded during the coordinated explosion of beepers used by Hezbollah members on Tuesday, with international media reports indicating that he was left blinded by the blast. According to a New York Times report, Ambassador Mojtaba Amani lost one eye in the explosion. His surviving eye was seriously damaged, leaving him with extremely limited vision. In a brief statement on Tuesday, the Iranian government admitted that Amani was wounded in the incident, but downplayed the severity of his injuries and said he was 'in good general condition' after being treated at a hospital. That false narrative was repeated by Amani's wife, Narges Ghadirian, who wrote on X that her husband was 'slightly injured, but thank God he is all right and the danger has passed.' Some unconfirmed reports are reporting that the Iran ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani has been injured in his eyes after checking his beeper potentially making him blind. We will confirm as we know. pic.twitter.com/biXkeE192I &mdash; Open Source Intel (@Osint613) September 17, 2024 Hossein Soleimani, who heads the IRGC's news website Mashregh, confirmed on X that Amani had been seriously wounded, several hours after the blasts. 'Unfortunately the injuries sustained by Iran’s ambassador were extremely severe and in his eyes,' Soleimani wrote. Tehran is planning to repatriate Amani on an emergency flight for additional medical care at a hospital in Iran. The fact that Amani was in possession of a beeper that exploded demonstrates the deep ties between Iran and the Hezbollah terror group. Two members of the IRGC confirmed to the New York Times that the beepers were only used by Hezbollah operatives and members. Iran is a long-time patron of Hezbollah, providing them with training, funding, and weapons for use against Israel. But Iran has often claimed that Hezbollah is not their proxy group, characterizing them as an Islamic resistance organization fighting for Lebanon, rather than at the behest of Tehran. Lebanon and Iran have blamed Israel for the explosions, which killed at least 9 people and injured some 3,000 more. Israel has refused to comment on the incident.

Mossad planted explosives in Hezbollah’s beepers 5 months ago, de...	On Tuesday, at least eleven were killed, and 4,000 people were wounded in Lebanon when beepers exploded simultaneously. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News According to Sky News Arabia, sources report that Mossad ensured explosives were implanted into the pagers and heated them remotely, causing them to detonate. On Tuesday, at least 11 were killed, and 4,000 people were wounded in Lebanon when beepers exploded simultaneously. Most of those killed or injured were Hezbollah terrorists. The report indicates that PETN, a highly explosive material, was implanted in the batteries of the beepers. The weight of the PETN explosives was less than 20 grams, and it is believed they were obtained and implanted 5 months ago. This was possible only through close cooperation with the manufacturer, who must have consented to the supply chain disruption. In an interview with Ma'ariv, Oleg Brodt, Director of Research, Development, and Innovation at Ben-Gurion University's Cyber Labs, explained, 'Many attacks occur by compromising the supply chain. Like a beeper, an electronic device contains numerous components, and each could be infected with malware.' He added, 'This malware could be designed to raise the device’s temperature, cause a malfunction, ignite it, or even trigger an explosion.' Brodt explained, 'In such cases, it’s essential to make the changes to the device without raising suspicion during the quality inspection.' Once implanted on the batteries of the beeper, the explosives were detonated by heating them up remotely. This might have been done using a 'kill switch,' as it is called in the cyber world. The kill switch is software designed to detonate a device at a certain time. It can be set off using a code word or even gibberish. 'It’s possible to set up a non-standard message—something unusual or even gibberish—broadcast to hundreds or thousands of devices simultaneously, causing simultaneous ignition and explosion,' Brodt explained. 'The radio waves the device receives are translated into a unique message that triggers a chain of events leading to the explosion.'

A Reuters journalist saw 10 terrorists bleeding from injuries in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiya, a main stronghold of Hezbollah. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS More than 4,000 Hezbollah terrorists were wounded and at least eleven were killed across Lebanon on Tuesday when their communication devices exploded, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad confirmed. Approximately 200 Hezbollah terrorists were in critical condition in 100 different hospitals, Beirut’s health minister announced about three hours after the explosions were first reported at 3.30 p.m. local time. A Reuters journalist saw 10 terrorists bleeding from injuries in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiya, which is the main stronghold of Hezbollah. A security source told Qatar’s Al Jazeera that explosions occurred across Lebanon—not only in Beirut but also in the Beqaa Valley and the south. Senior Hezbollah officials were said to have been wounded in the blasts. Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also wounded in one of the explosions, Tehran’s semi-official Mehr outlet reported.

Apparently, communication devices on Hezbollah members detonated wounding an unconfirmed number of fighters. pic.twitter.com/e9khfMDLNS &mdash; Joe Truzman (@JoeTruzman) September 17, 2024 Unconfirmed reports in Arab media claimed explosions also occurred in Damascus, wounding at least dozens of Hezbollah terror operatives. In its first official statement on the incident, Hezbollah announced that the pager explosions, 'the causes of which are still unknown,' killed at least three of its members, while wounding a large number of others. Shortly thereafter, the terrorist organization issued a statement that it held the Jewish state 'fully responsible for this criminal aggression.' Lebanese media affiliated with Hezbollah had attributed the incident to the Israel Defense Forces, claiming the mysterious blasts were caused by a hack of the terrorist group’s internal communications networks. The Wall Street Journal said the pagers were part of a new shipment that the terror group received in recent days. A Hezbollah official suggested that 'malware' may have caused the pagers to heat up and explode. Another Hezbollah terrorist official in Lebanon cited by Reuters called the alleged computer hack by Israel the 'biggest security breach so far.' The IDF declined to comment on the incident, which came just hours after the Israeli Cabinet added the return of citizens displaced from their homes in the north to the country’s war goals, bringing a potential major confrontation with Hezbollah closer to reality.

By JNS An Israeli aerial strike on Monday killed the head of Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s rocket and missile unit in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. Ahmed Aish Salame al-Hashash was embedded and operating inside the humanitarian zone in Khan Yunis when he was eliminated in the precision attack, according to the Israel Defense Forces. 'Al-Hashash was responsible for the Islamic Jihad’s rocket attacks in the Rafah Brigade and was an important source of knowledge […] within the Islamic Jihad terror organization in Gaza,' the IDF said.

'The terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip continue to systematically abuse civilian and humanitarian infrastructure to carry out terrorist activities and attacks on Israeli civilians,' the IDF statement concluded. 'The IDF will continue to operate against the terrorist organizations in defense of the State of Israel.' Soldier seriously wounded A reserve soldier in the IDF’s 846th Battalion, Givati Brigade, was seriously wounded during combat operations in the southern Gaza Strip, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said on Tuesday morning. He was evacuated to a hospital for treatment and his family was notified. IDF’s 5th Brigade deployed to Gaza’s Netzarim Corridor The Israel Defense Forces’ 5th Infantry Brigade has been stationed in the Netzarim Corridor that splits the Gaza Strip between north and south, the army announced on Monday. It is the second time the brigade has operated in the coastal enclave since Israeli forces entered the territory on Oct. 27. The brigade’s first tour of duty entailed protecting Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip in the first days of the war and ridding them of terrorists, before months of combat in the areas of Beit Hanun, Kherbat Ahzaa and the central corridor. The brigade falls under the command of the 252nd Division, which in recent months has been operating against Hamas and working to expand the axis dividing the northern and southern Strip. 'In the last few days, the brigade’s fighters completed a series of training and exercises at the Ground Forces Training Center (GTC). The forces carried out training and exercises in warfare in open and built-up areas and raised their operational competence in preparation for their mission in the center of the Gaza Strip,' the IDF said. 'In addition, the forces completed logistical preparation and held mobility, supplies and immediate medical response training in preparation for the fighting.'

Hezbollah plot to assassinate former Israeli security chief foile...	The Lebanese terror group had planned to bomb a former Israeli security official using a Claymore mine. By World Israel News Staff The Iran-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah plotted to assassinate a former senior Israeli security official using an anti-personnel mine, the Shin Bet internal security agency revealed Tuesday. The Shin Bet announced Tuesday afternoon that a former senior Israeli security official, whose identity remains barred from publication, was to have been targeted by Hezbollah terrorists in the next few days, using a remotely-detonated Claymore mine. 'As part of an operation by the General Security Service, a bomb attack on behalf of Hezbollah was foiled, which was targeted against a former senior official in the security system and was planned to be carried out in the coming days,' the Shin Bet said. According to the Shin Bet, the explosive device was linked to a cellular phone, allowing the bomb's handlers in Lebanon to observe when the target approached the mine and then detonate it remotely. The bomb was similar to another explosive device found in Hayarkon Park last September, planted as part of another Hezbollah plot to kill an Israeli official. Shin Bet officials believe that the same Hezbollah cell is behind both failed bombing attempts. 'Operational preparation and the activity of the forces prevented the attack in the final stages of implementation,' the Shin Bet said. 'The target of the attack has been updated by the security forces and is being updated accordingly.' 'The Shin Bet, together with its partners in the security system, will increase and operate with all the capabilities available to it to monitor and thwart Hezbollah's terrorist activities.' Six months before the Hayarkon Park bombing attempt, Hezbollah terrorists infiltrated into northern Israel and placed a bomb near Megiddo Junction, seirously injuring the driver of a passing vehicle.

Blinken heads to Egypt for talks on Israeli control of Philadelph...	Most of the holdup in a potential hostage deal allegedly centers around control of the Gaza-Egypt border, which has been Hamas’ weapons pipeline and is now in Israel’s hands. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is coming to Egypt Tuesday to hold discussions on the one of the main issues holding up a hostage deal with Hamas – control over the Philadelphi Corridor, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Citing 'an official in the region,' the report said that Blinken’s trip is being made 'to reassure Israel over its concerns that Hamas can smuggle weapons across' the Egyptian-Gazan border, which the IDF and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have called Hamas’ oxygen pipeline in terms of military resupply. Since taking the Corridor over several months ago, the Israeli army has discovered – and blown up – dozens of smuggling tunnels running from the Egyptian side into the Gazan city of Rafah, some large enough for trucks that can carry missiles as well as tons of cement for terror tunnel construction. Netanyahu has declared that Israel must control this nine-mile-long line or else Hamas will easily rearm, rebuild, and become a new 'existential' threat to the Jewish state within a few years’ time. Most of the Israeli public agrees that holding the Corridor is of utmost importance to Israel's security. Hamas refuses to sign off on a hostages-for-ceasefire-and-prisoners agreement unless the IDF withdraws, both from the southern line and the Netzarim Corridor that the army built in central Gaza that stretches to the Mediterranean Sea in order to cut the Strip in half. Although Cairo is considered by the U.S. to be a faithful mediator in the hostage talks, it has sided with Hamas in strenuously opposing an Israeli presence on its border with Gaza. Egypt has not acknowledged its total failure to prevent the wholesale Palestinian smuggling that is considered the main reason Hamas could become a major and immediate security threat to Israel, as it proved on October 7, when the terrorist organization led an invasion in which they and other Gazans massacred 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians. The paper pointed out that Blinken’s visit follows last week’s announcement that the U.S. would be providing Egypt with its full annual military aid package of $1.3 billion, overruling a Congressional directive that conditioned some of the funding on Cairo improving its human rights record, which is still considered deplorable by experts in the field. A State Department spokesperson said that the decision to restore the last $320 million of the package was 'important to advancing regional peace and Egypt’s specific and ongoing contributions to U.S. national security priorities, particularly to finalize a ceasefire agreement for Gaza' and help end the Israel-Hamas war. It is unknown whether Blinken will tie the Americans’ generosity to a request that Egypt soften its stance on the Philadelphi Corridor and persuade Hamas to do so as well, in order to get a deal done that will see the release of at least some of the live hostages still remaining in Hamas captivity over 11 months after they were abducted. President Joe Biden has repeatedly stated that freeing the hostages remains one of his top priorities. The ceasefire that would be part of the deal would also seemingly stop a possible Israel-Hezbollah war, as the Lebanese Shiite terrorists have said they would stop their constant rocket attacks on Israel if the fighting stops in Gaza. Jerusalem has made increasingly threatening noises in recent days to restore quiet in its northern region by invading Lebanon to push Hezbollah away from the border, as 60,000 Israelis are still evacuated from their homes for their safety, an untenable position for any government. Blinken’s trip to Cairo is in accord with the U.S. position that diplomatic means can prevent such a war, which it fears could turn into a wider, regional conflict that includes Hezbollah’s master, Iran.

Houthi terrorists preparing for ground invasion of Israel: Report	Journalist warns that Houthi ground forces are preparing to invade Israel, via Syrian or Jordanian borders. By World Israel News Staff Houthi terrorists may be gearing up for a ground invasion of Israel, despite their origin in Yemen some 2,000 kilometers away (1,240 miles), warned an Israeli analyst in a Hebrew-language column on Monday. Haggai Huberman, a journalist and political commentator, argued that Israeli defense officials should prepare for the 'real' threat of infiltration by Houthi fighters. 'The security establishment should understand that the Houthis are seriously aiming to carry out a ground attack against Israel, also as part of their response to Israel's attack on the port of Al Hudaydah,' Huberman wrote in a report for Arutz Sheva. Huberman explained that in recent months, Houthi terrorists have traveled from Yemen to Syria and Jordan, which both share a border with Israel. Disguised as civilians, some 50 Houthis were said to have reached Iraq in August. They were then were smuggled over the Syrian border by pro-Iran militias, according to his report in Arutz Sheva. These operatives reportedly are trained to launch missiles and operate explosive drones, and may be gearing up to launch a limited ground invasion of Israel from Syria or Lebanon. Later in August, Hebrew-language media reported that Jordan secretly warned Israel that dozens of Houthis had landed in Amman, and were planning to infiltrate the Jewish State via its eastern border. The Houthi's ground forces in Yemen consist of tens of thousands of fighters, who have battle experience from fighting in Yemen's civil war and against Saudi Arabia in the country. Notably, the Houthis have released videos demonstrating their fighters engaging in exercises that evoke the October 7th massacres, including invading Israelis army bases, rampaging through civilian villages, and taking hostages. The videos were accompanied by a caption explaining that the Houthis are preparing for a 'war of victory and holy jihad' against the Jewish State. 'We must be prepared and not be surprised again, as we were on October 7, 2023,' Huberman concluded.

Netanyahu: UK gov’t ‘undermining’ Israel, encouraging Hamas	Netanyahu blasts UK's arms embargo announced just days after hostages were executed, saying the move 'sends a horrible message to Hamas.' By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the UK government on Wednesday, blasting a recent moves by the country's ruling left-wing party such as arms embargo and tacit support for an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant which may be issued against him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'After the October 7 Hamas massacre, the previous British government was clear in its support. Unfortunately, the current government is sending mixed messages,' Netanyahu told UK outlet the Daily Mail. Netanyahu was particularly focused on the move to strip export licenses from UK-based weapons manufacturers providing arms to Israel. 'They say that Israel has the right to defend itself, but they undermine our ability to exercise that right both by reversing Britain’s position on the absurd allegations made by the ICC prosecutor against Israel and by blocking weapons sales to Israel as we fight against the genocidal terrorist organization that carried out the October 7 massacre.' He noted that news of the arms embargo became public just 'days after Hamas executed six Israeli hostages, sending a horrible message to Hamas.' The premier also mentioned the possibility of ICC warrants, which the UK's previous conservative government had staunchly opposed. 'The Labour ­Government decided to drop its challenge to the preposterous ICC arrest warrants that were requested by the ICC prosecutor against the prime minister and the defense minister of Israel,' Netanyahu said. 'If the arrest warrants are issued against the leaders of the only democracy in the Middle East, it will compromise the ability of all democracies in the world to fight terrorism, including Britain,' he warned. Netanyahu ended on an optimistic note, expressing confidence in an eventual Israeli victory over terror. 'Just as Britain’s heroic stand against the Nazis is seen today as having been vital in defeating barbarism, so too will history judge Israel’s stand against Hamas and Iran’s axis of terror. Israel will win this war and secure our common future,' Netanyahu said.

Invasion soon? IDF moves thousands of troops to northern border	Elite IDF division transferred to Lebanon border, amidst threat of all-out war between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group. By World Israel News Staff Amid sky-high tensions between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group, the Israeli army announced on Wednesday that it is deploying tens of thousands of troops to the northern border. The move comes one day after an alleged Mossad and IDF intelligence operation saw the simultaneous detonation of thousands of beepers belonging to Hezbollah members in Lebanon and Syria, killing at least nine and wounding some 3,000. The IDF said that it was transferring the elite 98th Division, numbering some 10,000 to 20,000 troops, to the border with Lebanon. The units within the 98th Division include paratroopers, artillery units, and commandos. Previously, the 98th Division was stationed in Khan Younes in central Gaza, but withdrew from the area in August. The 98th Division will join the 36th Division and numerous reserve units, which have been stationed along the northern border for months. In recent days, Israeli officials have signaled that the IDF is gearing up for an intensive military offensive against Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant both hinted to the Biden administration's envoy to the Middle East, Amos Hochstein, that time had run out for a diplomatic solution to end the fighting with Hezbollah. For more than 11 months, Hezbollah has bombarded communities and military assets in northern Israel with near-daily barrages of missiles, rockets, and explosive drones. At least 60,000 Israelis were displaced from their homes due to the ongoing aerial assaults. Tens of thousands more, who were not evacuated from their homes, live under constant threat of Hezbollah aggression. On Monday, the security cabinet officially declared the return of displaced northern to their home as a goal for the ongoing war. Former IAF commander Ori Gordin said that Israel will need to create a buffer zone in southern Lebanon, in order to protect residents of northern Israel and to prevent the Hezbollah terror group from operating in the region.

4 IDF soldiers killed, 6 wounded in Gaza fighting	Combat paramedic is first female soldiers to be killed in battle in the Strip. By World Israel News Staff Four Israeli soldiers were killed during the ongoing fighting against the Hamas terror group in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, the IDF announced in a media statement after their families were informed. They were named as Captain Daniel Maimon Toaff, 23, of Moreshet, Sergeant Agam Naim, 20, of Mishmarot, Sergeant Amit Bachari, 21, of Yoshivia, and Sergeant Dotan Shimon, 21, of Elazar. According to a report from Hebrew-language Mako news, investigators believed the four were killed by an explosive device, either hurled by terrorists at a building in which they were standing, or a booby-trap within the building that detonated when they entered. Toaff, Bachari, and Shimon were all combat soldiers in the Givati Brigade's Shaked Battalion stationed in the southern Strip. Naim, who was a paramedic, is the first female soldier to be killed in the Gaza Strip since the ground invasion began in late October 2023. 'We don't believe it. She was the most charming girl, beloved by all, a friend. She loved the role, she was extremely dedicated' to serving as a combat paramedic, said Ofek, a high-school friend of the late Naim, told Mako. 'Who could imagine? This is heart-breaking.' In the same incident in which the four were killed, an additional five soldiers were wounded and evacuated to hospitals in Israel. Three of them are listed as being in serious condition. Also on Tuesday, in a separate incident also in the southern region the Strip, another Givati soldier was seriously wounded in battle. The Israel death toll in the ground invasion now stands at 348, including a civilian contractor who was killed and Amnon Zamora, a police officer who was killed during the hostage rescue operation that freed Noa Argamani, Shlomi Ziv, Andrey Kozlov, and Almog Meir Jan.

Inside IDF’s plans for tech-heavy border fence on Jordanian front...	Installing hundreds of monitoring devices and the establishment of a new Eastern Command are parts of the first phase of the project. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF has developed a detailed plan for fully safeguarding the Jordanian border and will present it to the Finance and Defense ministries in the coming days for funding approval, Ynet reported Tuesday. In the first, immediate phase of the plan, hundreds of monitoring and observation instruments will be placed along a 400-kilometer stretch from Eilat to Hamat Gader at the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee. The radars and cameras will be installed on high poles, to detect illicit attempts to cross the border either by terrorists or smugglers. When such an attempt is detected, fast mobile forces will be sent to the suspicious area. It is 'possible,' said the report, that some soldiers will use gliders or other airborne vehicles to arrive and attack quickly. An upgraded physical barrier is also included in the plan, as currently there is nothing blocking the border in the entire desert (Arava) area, and in other places, such as the Jordan Valley, the barrier consists only of a decades-old, rusty and low fence. The formation of a completely new, Eastern division that will guard Israel’s longest land border is also in the works. A unique element in the plan is to have one of the brigades in the division consist of ultra-Orthodox men serving in the Jordan Valley, which would put them in close proximity to their yeshivas (learning institutions) in the Jerusalem area. This single, unified Command would ostensibly be more effective than the current situation, where a mix of reservist and regular battalions belonging to two different Commands – Southern and Central – rotate in and out of various domains along the border. The estimated cost of the project is somewhere between the NIS2.5 billion invested in the high fences strewn with technological means of detection along the Egyptian border that stopped the infiltration of tens of thousands of illegal migrants, and the NIS4 billion barrier down the length of the Gaza Strip, which was built both above and below the ground in order to stop terror tunnels from crossing into Israel. While the Gaza barrier was largely successful in stopping smuggling attempts, criminals make constant runs at the 220km-long Sinai fence, with the IDF acknowledging that has not been able to stop a majority of them, due to the sparseness of its forces there. Most, but not all, of the southern gangs are running drugs, not guns. The Jordanian border, however, has recently become a huge conduit for all kinds of weapons, including advanced rifles and explosives. According to the report, the 'regular' smuggling routes have been taken over by the Iranian Quds Force, which is eager to turn Judea and Samaria into a serious terror challenge for Israel as well as a real threat to take over the Palestinian Authority. The explosives in particular are a worry for the IDF, as the Palestinians in such terror centers as Jenin have mastered the tactic of planting bombs along and underneath streets where they expect IDF forces to travel, and they are much more powerful and deadly than the homemade, fertilizer-based ones of the past. Over the last three years, the army and police have stepped up their anti-smuggling operations, and hundreds of attempts have been foiled, with the confiscation of thousands of weapons. 'But for every such thwarting, there are at least three to five smuggling operations that are successful, and we don't know about them,' one security official said.

‘This is madness’ – US furious over Netanyahu plan to fire defens...	Biden administration furious over potential cabinet shake-up, says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'would be crazy' to replace Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration is furious over an expected move by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant - with whom he has repeatedly butted heads - and replace him with New Hope party chairman Gideon Saa'ar. 'Replacing a defense minister during a war for political reasons is an act of madness, especially when it's a defense minister with military experience,' a senior American diplomat fumed to Hebrew-language news outlet Channel 12 on Monday, following reports about the likely change in Netanyahu's cabinet. Another Biden administration official told Axios that Netanyahu 'would be crazy' to replace 'an experienced minister of defense like Gallant amid a war in Gaza and as Israel might be heading towards a possible all out war in Lebanon.' Former defense minister Benny Gantz also lashed out against Netanyahu regarding the anticipated move, saying at a conference on Tuesday morning that the premier is 'endangering Israel’s security during a war.' The Biden administration has enjoyed a close relationship with Gallant, whom they felt was a counterweight to more hawkish political leaders in Netanyahu's coalition, such as Public Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir of the Otzma Yehudit party. Washington likely views Gallant being replaced as another step towards a large-scale military confrontation with Hezbollah, following an announcement that the return of displaced northerners to their homes has officially been added as a goal for the ongoing war. The U.S. has been intensely pressuring Israel to refrain from launching a high intensity military campaign against the Lebanon-based terror group until after the November presidential elections. But according to a Channel 12 report, both the political and defense establishments feel that the tit-for-tat attacks which have defined much of the fighting with Hezbollah over the past 11 months aren't sufficient for deterring the terror group, and that the chances of a diplomatic solution to the conflict are slim.

Courts: Judea and Samaria towns cannot bar Palestinian workers	Before the war, some 200,000 Palestinian workers were employed throughout the Jewish state, including 30,000 in Judea and Samaria. By JNS Elected local officials in Israeli communities throughout Judea and Samaria do not have the legal right to block Palestinian laborers from entering their communities if the military allows their employment, Israeli courts have confirmed in a series of recent cases, Israel Hayom reported on Sunday. In a case brought by a group of Arab workers against the city of Efrat in Judea’s Gush Etzion region, a judge ruled that the municipality’s blanket ban on the entry of Palestinian Authority residents was illegal. 'Starting next Tuesday, in accordance with the army’s decision and the court ruling, construction workers will resume their activities within Efrat,' Mayor Dovi Shefler said in a message to residents last week. In a conversation with Israel Hayom on Monday, Shefler noted that the court ruled that local officials in Judea and Samaria 'do not have the authority to make the military’s instructions stricter.' Srugim, an Israeli news site catering to the religious Zionist community, reported that at least three other towns received similar rulings in recent months. A settlement reached in a Jerusalem court some five months ago following litigation between the town of Ma’ale Efrayim in the Jordan Valley and four construction companies likewise stated that the IDF would have the final say regarding the admission of P.A. laborers. While the military banned Palestinians from working in Jewish towns throughout Judea and Samaria in the initial months following Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre, Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fox, the then-head of the IDF Central Command, in late 2023 lifted the access restrictions for industrial zones. During the court proceedings, attorneys representing four development companies argued that Ma’ale Efrayim should allow P.A. workers to enter again, claiming that the IDF decision regarding industrial zones should also apply to construction sites in the town’s new neighborhood. Last week, Knesset member Zvi Sukkot (Religious Zionism Party), in a letter to the IDF demanded that the military cancel its policy, noting it forces communities to let in workers despite security concerns. 'The communities must admit Palestinian laborers, even if they express explicit opposition to their entry,' Sukkot noted in a letter to IDF Central Command head Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth. 'Palestinians are banned from entering inside the Green Line due to the security threat; in Judea and Samaria, they have to let them in, even if the communities oppose it.' Before the war, some 200,000 Palestinian workers were employed throughout the Jewish state, including 30,000 in Judea and Samaria. Two surveys last year found that some two-thirds of Palestinians in Judea and Samaria support the Oct. 7 attacks, in which around 6,000 Hamas-led terrorists broke through the Gaza border, murdered some 1,200 people, wounded thousands more and took more than 250 captive. Plans to readmit Palestinians to Jewish communities have been met with dismay by many Israelis. A poll taken in Eli, a town of some 4,500 inhabitants in the Binyamin region of Samaria, showed that 82% of residents oppose their entry, regardless of added security measures.

Return of displaced northerners officially declared a war goal	Netanyahu tells U.S. official that while Israel appreciates American support, it will 'do what is necessary' to safeguard citizens, security of the state. By World Israel News Staff Israel appeared to take an additional step towards launching an intensive military campaign against Hezbollah, as the national security cabinet announced that the return of evacuated residents of the north as an official goal for the ongoing war. Following the October 7th terror onslaught, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defined the aims of the war as returning all of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas, dismantling Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and ensuring that the terror group never again poses a security threat to the Jewish State. Ensuring the safe return of those forced from their homes near the border with Lebanon has now been added to the list of war objectives, as Israeli officials signal that the IDF is preparing for a large-scale offensive against Hezbollah. Since October 8th, Hezbollah has launched near-daily salvos on northern Israeli communities and military assets. The barrages of rockets, missiles, and explosive drones forced the evacuation of at least 60,000 Israelis from their homes adjacent to the Lebanese border. Tens of thousands of northerners, who were not displaced, have been living under the constant threat of Hezbollah aggression for almost a year. The U.S. has been intensely pressuring Israel to hold off on the campaign until after the November presidential elections, according to Hebrew-language media reports. However, it's unclear if Israel will abide by that timeline. The Biden administration's special envoy to the Middle East, Amos Hochstein, traveled to Israel on Monday and met with several Israeli officials, including Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, in what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to persuade Israel to avoid decisive military action. 'The Prime Minister made it very clear that it will not be possible to return our residents without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north,' read a summary of the meeting published by the premier's office. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu said that while Israel appreciates and respects the support of the U.S., it will – ultimately – do what is necessary to safeguard its security and return the residents of the north securely to their homes.'

War in Gaza fuels surge in psychiatric drug prescriptions	Southern Israeli communities experienced a 33% increase in antidepressant use and a 25% rise in sleeping pill consumption. By Jewish Breaking News A concerning new study highlights a significant increase in psychiatric drug use in Israel since the start of the war in Gaza. Presented at the Israeli Society for Quality in Medicine’s annual meeting in Tel Aviv on Sunday, the research from the Meir Medical Center reveals a 50% increase in anti-anxiety medication purchases and a tripling of narcotic pain reliever acquisitions among the general population. Among the southern Israeli communities hit the hardest on October 7 by Hamas’ brutal massacre, the crisis is even more pronounced with a 200% increase in anti-anxiety drug purchases and a 250% rise in narcotic pain reliever use. These areas also experienced a 33% increase in antidepressant use and a 25% rise in sleeping pill consumption. Research leader Dr. Hornik-Lurie of Meir warns that urgent action is needed to prevent addiction, especially among high-risk groups. 'The risk factors for the consumption of all four families of drugs after October 7th are older age, living in the Gaza Envelope on October 7th, living in a peripheral area, and being female,'she explains. 'We observed an alarming increase in the consumption of anti-anxiety drugs and a spike in the use of narcotic pain relievers after the outbreak of the war. We suggest conducting further studies that will examine the long-term effects of the war on the entire population and the residents of the surrounding area, in particular.'

Netanyahu poised to fire Defense Minister Gallant and replace him...	Sources close to the prime minister say he is on the verge of firing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and is preparing to bring in a party from the Opposition to bolster his government. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to dismiss Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud) from his government, and bring in a party from the Opposition to bolster the Coalition, Kan Hadashot reported Monday. Citing an official in the Prime Minister's Office, the report claimed that Netanyahu is prepared to fire Gallant 'within a short time,' as talks progress between the ruling Likud party and the New Hope. Members of Netanyahu's inner circle are reportedly nearing an agreement with New Hope chief and former Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar to bring the four-MK faction into the government, expanding its narrow majority. Sa'ar, a former member of the Likud and longtime rival of Netanyahu, bolted the Likud in 2020 to form the New Hope party, which later formed an alliance with Benny Gantz's Blue and White party. The talks, which reportedly continued through the night from Sunday to Monday, are being brokered by Justice Minister Yariv Levin (Likud), a figure relied upon by both Sa'ar and Netanyahu. The inclusion of the New Hope faction in the government would better position Netanyahu to pass a new proposed draft law, reinstating draft deferments for full-time yeshiva students over the objections of Gallant and several other Likud faction members. Netanyahu is under growing pressure to pass the bill, mollifying his ultra-Orthodox allies Shas and United Torah Judaism, and potentially ending a political crisis caused by the Supreme Court's striking down of the previous draft law in 2017. On June 25th, the Supreme Court handed down a precedent-setting ruling ordering the army to immediately draft 3,000 ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students who had hitherto benefited from the long-running draft deferment policy, which has offered annual exemptions to full-time yeshiva students. After multiple extensions of the 2015 law, which was struck down by the court in 2017, Supreme Court justices ruled unanimously that the no more extensions would be granted and that the government must work with the military to draft thousands of ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students and end social benefits to families of those who refuse to appear at draft centers. Ultra-Orthodox lawmakers have demanded the government pass a new law largely restoring the status quo ante, while Defense Minister Gallant and several other Likud members have called for major changes to the draft deferment system. Over the past few weeks, Shas and UTJ have threatened to topple the government if the issue is not addressed. Netanyahu is also reportedly frustrated with Gallant's handling of the war in Gaza and the ongoing conflict on Israel's northern border. The prime minister, according to sources close to Netanyahu cited in a report by Kan Hadashot, clashed repeatedly behind closed doors recently with Gallant, accusing him of not taking decisive action against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. 'If Gallant tries to block a [major military] operation, he will be replaced,' Netanyahu's confidants were quoted as saying. Sa'ar is reportedly seeking the Defense Ministry portfolio, though Netanyahu is said to be trying to retain the Defense portfolio for the Likud, and offer instead the Foreign Ministry portfolio, currently held by Israel Katz (Likud). Talks between the Likud and the New Hope reportedly include proposals to also offer a ministerial position to former minister Ze'ev Elkin, another former member of the Likud.

Palestinians pay $800 for ‘donated’ tents: How Hamas uses humanit...	Hamas’s methods for maintaining control over aid distribution are reported to include severe punitive measures against those who attempt to bypass their control. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Despite Gaza’s widespread devastation, Hamas continues paying salaries to its gunmen and civil servants partly through taxing and diverting humanitarian aid and distributing food vouchers — with the help of clans, criminal groups and so-called 'People’s Committees.' An Israeli security official told The Press Service of Israel, 'Hamas’ governance situation in the northern Gaza Strip is suffering from progressive necrosis,' adding that humanitarian aid appears to be 'intensive treatment' for the terror group. This perspective highlights the complexity of the situation in Gaza, where aid intended to alleviate the suffering of civilians is instead helping to sustain Hamas’s grip on power. Last week, Hamas managed to pay full salaries to its fighters and partial salaries to thousands of its 27,000 civil servants, TPS-IL has learned. This was done despite the heavy financial burden it places on the terror group, highlighting its determination to maintain its grip on Gaza. However, the continued financing of its war with Israel has raised concerns about the sources of this funding. Reports indicate that Hamas uses a variety of methods to gather revenue, including the imposition of 'transit taxes' on aid trucks carrying food, water, medicine, tents, blankets, and other goods into the Strip. According to testimonies, Hamas operatives in civilian clothes set up surprise checkpoints along key routes leading from the border crossings into Gaza. At these roadblocks, truck drivers are forced to pay hefty sums ranging from 50,000-100,000 shekels ($13,400-$27,000) or relinquish up to 50 percent of their cargo’s contents. In one reported instance, Hamas members seized 200 gas cylinders from a single truck, leaving only a small number behind — a profit of tens of thousands of dollars for the terror group. Charging $800 for ‘Donated’ Tents Beyond direct taxation, Hamas has been accused of confiscating humanitarian aid. Testimonies reveal that Hamas operates through a network of local clans and gangs that control main roads and intercept aid shipments. They then transfer this aid to Hamas warehouses, essentially creating a parallel economy. In return for their cooperation, these gangs receive monthly payments, reportedly around $10,000, ensuring a steady flow of goods to Hamas-controlled areas, including its tunnel network. This diversion extends to shelter and food aid as well. Tents sent from Arab countries intended to provide shelter for displaced Palestinians are reportedly being sold by Hamas at a cost of around 3,000 shekels ($800) per family. Food supplies, which include essentials delivered by trucks from various international donors, are looted and sold at inflated prices, sometimes 20 to 30 times their original cost. One report mentions that the price of a pack of cigarettes has soared to an astonishing $1,200. Hamas distributes food vouchers and coupons primarily through mosques under its supervision. According to several accounts, these distributions are carefully managed to benefit Hamas loyalists and their families. To enforce this system, Hamas deploys secret police units in shelters for displaced persons, ensuring that food and aid supplies are not accessed by unauthorized individuals. Hamas’s methods for maintaining control over aid distribution are reported to include severe punitive measures against those who attempt to bypass their control. Witnesses recount incidents in which residents caught with stolen goods were either killed or publicly humiliated. For incident, Hamas hung a resident of the Nuseirat refugee camp for allegedly stealing food. In another layer of control over humanitarian aid, Hamas receives support from organizations known as the 'People’s Committees' or the 'Emergency Committees.' These groups, comprising local clans, have agreements with Hamas allowing them to keep a portion of the aid arriving in Gaza while transferring the rest to Hamas. 'We didn’t know from the beginning to what extent the treatment of the humanitarian issue is a decisive element in the management of the war,' a senior Israeli political official told TPS-IL. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Israel ‘preparing for long war’ with Hezbollah – Report	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaling that Israel is ready for a large-scale confrontation with the Lebanon-based terror group. By World Israel News Staff As the chances of a ceasefire with the Hamas terror group in Gaza continue to fade, Israel is viewing an all-out war with Hezbollah as inevitable and is taking steps to prepare, according to Hebrew-language media reports. An anonymous security official told Channel 12 News on Friday that Israel 'should gear up for a long war' on the northern front. During a security cabinet meeting last Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly said Israel would soon need to engage in a 'large-scale confrontation' with Hezbollah. He expressed pessimism over the likelihood that Hezbollah's near-daily bombardments of communities and military assets in northern Israel could be stopped via a diplomatic agreement. Over the past 11 months, Hezbollah has caused at least 1 billion shekels in damages to homes in border areas, as well as forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of Israelis who lived near the Lebanese border. Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were said to have disagreed over the impact of a war with Hezbollah on Gaza. Gallant warned that a war in the north would necessitate the withdrawal of troops from the Gaza Strip in favor of placing them in Lebanon, which would reduce pressure on the Hamas terror group. The premier disagreed, saying he believed a simultaneous war in Lebanon would have little effect on Gaza, Channel 13 News reported. Netanyahu also pushed for the security cabinet to add the return of northern residents as an official goal of the ongoing war - a move that would signal Israel's intention to launch a decisive military campaign against Hezbollah, rather than continue the tit-for-tat attacks that have so far defined the conflict. Ynet reported that Netanyahu will travel to New York in late September in order to address the UN General Assembly, using the visit to drum up international support for an Israeli offensive against Hezbollah. Washington is reportedly pressuring Israel to delay attack plans until after the November 5th presidential election, but it's unclear if Israel will abide by that timeline.

Gal Gadot joins Israeli President Herzog’s ‘Voice of the People’ ...	The virtual event on Sunday will feature a live conversation between Herzog and Gadot, who will talk about Jewish pride and perseverance. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Israeli actress Gal Gadot will take part in a virtual event on Sunday that will mark the launch of Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s global initiative 'Voice of the People.' The initiative is a global Jewish council that aims to build 'a stronger, resilient Jewish community that will inspire and impact future generations.' It hopes to unite Jews from around the world and have them work together on addressing challenges affecting Jewish people worldwide. Herzog announced the initiative in August, and it is being lead by The President’s House as well as the World Zionist Organization, the Jewish Agency for Israel, and philanthropic supporters. The virtual event on Sunday will feature a live conversation between Herzog and Gadot, who will talk about Jewish pride and perseverance, according to Jewish News. The online event will also include a conversation between journalist Tamar Ish-Shalom and Daniel Lifshitz, who is the grandson of released Hamas hostage Yocheved Lifshitz, and Oded Lifshitz, who has remained in Hamas captivity since Oct. 7. There will also be a musical performance by Michal Greenglick, the sister of the late IDF soldier Shaul Greenglick. He was killed fighting Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip in December 2023 mere weeks after auditioning for the Israeli television singing competition 'The Next Star.' 'Our Jewish culture is one that celebrates the living vitality of discourse,' said Herzog. 'It is our responsibility to deepen the conversation between us — to come together and have honest discussions about vital issues facing the Jewish people. To develop the next generation of committed Jewish leaders, who will bring their gifts and their talents to preserving our precious peoplehood.' The 'Voice of the People' initiative has 150 members — 50 from Israel, 50 from the United States and Canada, and 50 from around the world. The members are selected for a two-year term. The initiative also has 10 fellows as well as appointed mentors.

European airlines resume operations to Israel	With Iran’s imminent threat of retaliation for the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh not materializing, a growing list of international carriers have steadily been returning to Israel. By Jewish Breaking News Virgin Atlantic has announced it will restart its service to Tel Aviv just ahead of the High Holidays. The British carrier will initially operate one daily flight between London Heathrow and Tel Aviv beginning on September 25, down from its pre-Oct. 7 schedule of two daily flights. Bookings are now available on the airline’s website, with connection options to destinations in the United States. Virgin Atlantic plans to utilize larger aircraft on this route compared to its competitor British Airways, which currently employs narrow-body Airbus A321 planes for its Tel Aviv service. To address ongoing security concerns, the airline will implement a brief stop in Cyprus for crew changes. Passengers will remain on the aircraft during this stopover. However, the return leg will operate as a non-stop flight from Tel Aviv to London. With Iran’s imminent threat of retaliation for the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh not materializing, a growing list of international carriers have steadily been returning to Israel. Lufthansa Group recently restarted operations to Israel after a month-long hiatus. The group, which includes Lufthansa Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Swiss, and Eurowings, will operate between six Western European destinations and Tel Aviv. Other airlines that have resumed service include Ethiopian Airlines, Wizz Air, Bulgaria Air, Aegean, Air Europe, Iberia, Tarom, and LOT Polish Airlines. However, some European carriers still remain cautious. Ryanair has announced it will not resume flights to Israel until at least the end of October. The return of international flights is seen as a positive step for Israel’s tourism industry, which has been severely impacted by the ongoing war against Hamas. Financial experts estimate the war’s economic impact at 198 billion shekels ($53 billion), with reduced growth forecasts for the remainder of 2024. As more airlines return to the market, competition on popular routes is expected to increase. Currently, El Al holds a monopoly on direct flights between Tel Aviv and New York, with high demand leading to premium fares for return tickets during the holiday season. Travelers are advised to check the latest travel advisories and entry requirements before booking flights to Israel as the security situation remains unstable.

Israeli tech thrives despite conflict, raises $7.8B in private fu...	The report also noted that private funding trends in Israel and the US 'closely mirrored' each other, with both ecosystems experiencing similar declines after October 2023. By Noah Michaeli, TPS While certain sectors of the Israeli economy have suffered small declines over the past year of war, the country’s tech ecosystem remains strong and continues to develop, according to a report released on Thursday. 'If you look at indicators of health in the different sectors, it’s a story of resilience,' Avi Hasson, CEO of StartUp Nation Central told The Press Service of Israel. Startup Nation Central, which released the report, is a Tel Aviv-based non-profit that promotes Israeli startups and innovation. 'The money raised this year is similar to previous years and mirrors the trend of what we’re seeing in the US,' he explained. 'One would expect that with all the extra load, due to the war, we would see an underperformance. But we haven’t.' The report details the impact of the attack and subsequent war on Israel’s tech ecosystem. According to the report, despite the ongoing war and global funding challenges, Israel’s tech sector raised $7.8 billion across 577 private funding rounds — a small 4% decline from the $8.2 billion recorded in the same period last year. 'This resilience indicates the continued confidence of investors in the long-term potential of Israel’s innovation landscape,' the report said. Meanwhile, mergers and acquisitions reached $9.6 billion across 73 deals, slightly down from $10.6 billion the previous year. The business software and cybersecurity sectors led this activity, with notable exits such as WalkMe’s acquisition by SAP and Run’s acquisition by Nvidia. The report also noted that private funding trends in Israel and the US 'closely mirrored' each other, with both ecosystems experiencing similar declines after October 2023. 'Israel’s funding levels initially dropped to 66% by February 2024, while the U.S. saw a more moderate decline to 87%. Both ecosystems rebounded by May, with Israel recovering to 152% and the U.S. to 158% of their October levels,' the report said. Another finding of the report related to business continuity. 'The conflict has forced 24% of companies to relocate some of their operations, and 44% reported shortages in human capital. Despite these challenges, 54% of companies remain confident in their ability to grow in the coming year, particularly in the cybersecurity and business software sectors, the report said. All About Demand Hasson told TPS-IL that one of primary reasons Israeli hi-tech has not suffered despite the difficulties is demand. 'Unlike tourism, the demand for Israeli hi-tech didn’t go down due to the war. As long as you can deliver, you’re ok,' Hasson explained. He noted that 90% of Israeli hi-tech is software, not physical hardware produced in a factory, meaning that disruptions from the war are less important. He added that the vast majority of Israeli hi-tech is not in the north or south, the hardest-hit regions of the country. One trend that the report does note, however, is that due to rising uncertainty, investors are now tending to go to the lower-risk sectors and are therefore risk averse to earlier-stage startups. 'Much more attention is now on mega rounds, on later-stage companies, than there was before,' he explained adding that while it may be getting harder to be a beginning-stage business, this is a global trend. While there is an increasing desire to avoid risk, for some sectors, this is not necessarily a negative development. Hasson cited an emergence of many companies and VC startups in the defense sector, while companies focusing on rehabilitation and mental health are also doing well. While acknowledging that there is definitely nervousness on the part of investors, Hasson is highly optimistic. 'What we’re seeing is simply a reflection of the fact that what Israel can offer the world is unique,' Hasson said.

Canada blocks $60 million arms sale to Israel	In 2022 alone, Canada exported $21 million worth of military equipment to Israel. By Jewish Breaking News Canada has announced the immediate suspension of 30 arms shipments to Israel, citing concerns over alleged ‘genocide’ in Gaza. 'Our policy is clear: We will not have any form of arms or parts of arms be sent to Gaza. Period,' Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said at the Liberal caucus retreat in Nanaimo, B.C. 'How they’re being sent and where they’re being sent is irrelevant.' The suspension extends beyond just Canadian companies. A Quebec-based subsidiary of Virginia’s General Dynamics had been tapped to produce explosive mortar cartridges for Israel in a $61.1 million deal orchestrated by the US government last month. This means, not only will Israel not be receiving these vital pieces of ammunition to defend herself from annihilation, all permits approved before January 8 when Canada initially announced a halt on arms sales to Israel, will now be reviewed. Up until Tuesday’s announcement, Canada had an estimated maximum of $136 million in approved Israeli military permits. In fact, Israel has historically been one of the top recipients of Canadian arms exports. In 2022 alone, Canada exported $21 million worth of military equipment to Israel. According to CBC News, the National Council of Canadian Muslims is behind the grassroots movement to leave the Jewish State defenseless, claiming Israel has a ‘well-documented pattern of human-rights violations’ in Gaza and Judea and Samaria. 'Over the last few weeks alone, Israel attacked at least seven schools.

Israel to bar Al Jazeera reporters	After shutting down Al Jazeera operations in Israel, the Israeli government announces plans to withdraw press credentials for reporters working on behalf of the Qatar-based media outlet. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli government is set to ban journalists working for the Qatar-based media outlet Al Jazeera from operating inside of Israel, the Government Press Office announced Thursday afternoon. In a statement, the GPO said that press credentials would not be issued to Al Jazeera reporters and presenters, and that all previously issued journalist passes would be nullified. 'The Government Press Office is revoking the GPO cards of Al Jazeera journalists working in Israel, following the unanimous government decision in May to shut down the channel in Israel and prohibit its broadcasts.' Government Press Office Director Nitzan Chen defended the decision, calling Al Jazeera a 'threat' to Israeli soldiers. 'This is a media outlet that disseminates false content, which includes incitement against Israelis and Jews and constitutes a threat to IDF soldiers,' said Chen. 'Therefore, the use of GPO cards in the course of the journalists' work could in itself jeopardize state security at this time of military emergency.' The revocation of GPO cards will be subject to a hearing and will include Al Jazeera journalists and broadcasters in both Hebrew and Arabic, but will not include the channel's producers and photographers. The revocation will be valid for as long as the Knesset legislation and the temporary order are in force. In April, the Knesset passed legislation enabling the Communications Minister to temporarily shut down media outlets during wartime should they be deemed a threat to national security. A month later, Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi announced plans to shutter Al Jazeera and revoke the agency’s press credentials. Since then, the government has moved to draft legislation that would, if passed, enable the permanent banning of Al Jazeera.
