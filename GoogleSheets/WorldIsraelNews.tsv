Trump pushing for Gaza ceasefire by January 20th – report	Senator Lindsey Graham, an ally of President-elect Donald Trump, warns Israeli leaders not to assume Trump will back plans to annex, resettle Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff President-elect Donald Trump has signaled that he wants Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire deal by the time he enters office on January 20th, a senior Republican lawmaker and Trump ally said last week. In a report published last Friday by Axios, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said that the 45th president - and soon to be 47th - has repeatedly said that he wants to see a deal freeing the remaining 101 Israeli hostages and ending the war in Gaza reached by inauguration day next month. 'Trump is more determined than ever to release the hostages and supports a ceasefire that includes a hostage deal. He wants to see it happening now,' Graham was quoted as saying. 'I want people in Israel and in the region to know that Trump is focused on the hostages issue. He wants the killing to stop and the fighting to end.' Graham, a pro-Israel figure in the upper chamber of Congress, expressed optimism that the Biden administration can cooperate with the Trump transition team to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. The senator spoke with Axios after returning to the U.S. following a pair of trips to the Middle East, during which he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Turning to plans proposed by Israeli government ministers to resettle and annex the Gaza Strip, Graham warned against assuming they would have the incoming president's support. 'I think he should talk to Trump and hear what he wants,' Graham said of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who last month called for Israel to adopt a policy of promoting voluntary mass emigration of Arabs from Gaza. 'If you haven't spoken to him, I wouldn't put words in his mouth.' 'The best insurance policy against Hamas is not an Israeli reoccupation of Gaza but a reform in the Palestinian society. The only ones who can do that are the Arab countries.'

After aid convoys looted by armed gangs of Gazans, UNRWA announces it has halted transfer of aid to Gaza through the primary crossing from Israel. By World Israel News Staff The United Nations relief agency tasked with supporting Palestinian Arabs has halted the transfer of aid to the Gaza Strip via the primary border crossing between Israel and the coastal enclave, following a spate of looting incidents. On Sunday, Philippe Lazzarini commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) took to X/Twitter to announce that his agency has suspended aid transfers to Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing. 'We are pausing the delivery of aid through Kerem Shalom, the main crossing point for humanitarian aid into Gaza,' Lazzarini wrote. Lazzarini noted that an entire convoy of food trucks was looted by armed Gazan gangs after entering the Strip on Saturday, adding that this was not the first time aid convoys had been hijacked or looted en masse. 'The road out of this crossing has not been safe for months. On 16 November, a large convoy of aid trucks was stolen by armed gangs. Yesterday, we tried to bring in a few food trucks on the same route. They were all taken.' 'This difficult decision comes at a time hunger is rapidly deepening. The delivery of humanitarian aid must never be dangerous or turn into an ordeal.' Blaming Israel for the 'breakdown in law and order' in the Gaza Strip, which was ruled by the Hamas terror organization prior to Israel's invasion, Lazzarini tasked the IDF with providing security to aid convoys carrying goods into Gaza. 'The responsibility of protection of aid workers + supplies is with the State of Israel as the occupying power. They must ensure aid flows into Gaza safely & must refrain from attacks on humanitarian workers.' 'I call once again for a #ceasefire that would also secure the delivery of safe & uninterrupted aid to people in need.'

Trump taps Kash Patel as nominee for FBI director	Patel has served as chief of staff to the acting Secretary of Defense and has held roles in counterterrorism and intelligence operations. By Jewish Breaking News President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Kash Patel as his nominee for FBI Director. Patel, a former federal prosecutor and key figure in Trump’s first administration, is known for his aggressive stance against government bureaucracy and promises sweeping changes, including the creation of a transparency office to release records on the JFK assassination, 9/11, and similar events. Patel rose to prominence while working as an aide to Rep. Devin Nunes on the House Intelligence Committee, playing a key role in challenging the Russia investigation. He later served as chief of staff to the acting Secretary of Defense and has held roles in counterterrorism and intelligence operations. Patel’s vision for reform includes shutting down the FBI’s J. Edgar Hoover Building, reopening it as a 'museum of the Deep State,' and dispersing agents nationwide to focus on criminal investigations. He has criticized the misuse of classification systems as a tool to conceal corruption. With his deep ties to Trump’s agenda and his track record in intelligence and law enforcement, Patel’s nomination is seen as a game-changer for the FBI’s future direction. document.createElement('video'); The post Trump taps Kash Patel as nominee for FBI director appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/trump-taps-kash-patel-as-nominee-for-fbi-director/	2024-12-01T03:47:15-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/shutterstock_2270821397-scaled.jpg
‘Without the civil squads I wouldn’t be here’: The fight to equip...	Friday’s event was complete with stands and booths giving away everything from tactical gear and vests to gifts, clothes, and school for the children of squad members, also came complete with food, live music, and speeches. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Understaffed, undersupplied, underfunded, and overworked, local Israeli civilian security teams were forced to battle heavily armed Hamas terrorists on October 7. Since then, they have been forced to do everything from providing security for their communities during an ongoing war to putting out forest fires sparked by daily Hezbollah missile barrages. In the face of these challenges, two Israeli nonprofits, Civil Squads of Israel and Israel Support Bridge, came together with around 1,500 members of the security teams and their families for an event on Friday morning, to provide some badly needed equipment, and express appreciation. 'For some, it’s one of the only times they’re able to get together and have a good time with their family in safety since October 7,' Alon Tirer, one of the founders of Civil Squads of Israel, told The Press Service of Israel. Before the October 7 attacks, members of kitot konenut — as they are known in Hebrew – were trained in basic military and first aid skills and equipped, in theory, to handle threats until security forces arrived. However, many civil defense squad members didn’t have enough helmets, vests, weapons, and more. Friday’s event was complete with stands and booths giving away everything from tactical gear and vests to gifts, clothes, and school for the children of squad members, also came complete with food, live music, and speeches. 'The [Israel Defense Forces] are here to protect us, but we must recognize that in the critical first minutes, the local defense force will often stand alone,' said former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett at the event. 'If four individuals managed to fend off dozens of terrorists, imagine what a platoon with machine guns, reserve training days, and a properly funded security coordinator could achieve – nothing could overcome them,' he added. For that reason, one of the main focuses of the event was enabling civil defense squad members to stock up on gear, Tirer explained. 'People can choose for themselves whatever equipment they like. It’s shopping for free,' he told TPS-IL. The two nonprofits have done significantly more than that over the past year. While Civil Squads of Israel is on the ground providing gear and training to the individual kitot konenut, Israel Support Bridge is known for its connections with donors, recipients and various government bodies. 'After October 7, I reached out to all the people I knew,' Ben Mammon, founder and CEO of Israel Support Bridge, told TPS-IL. Mammon quickly began talking to people on the ground, different organizations, and government ministries, organizing a database of Israel’s wartime needs and figuring out how to get it to the right people. One of those people was Nir Alon, founder and CEO of Civil Squads of Israel. Born and raised in Kibbutz Sufa in the Gaza border region, Alon survived October 7 in a shelter at the kibbutz, and attributes his survival to the sacrifice of his community’s security team. 'During the attack there were only four people in the civil squad in Sufa, only four rifles with no scopes,' Alon recalled. 'Without the civil squads I wouldn’t be here, so I took this very seriously and realized that something needs to be done,' Alon said. Since then, Civil Squads of Israel has launched trainings and supply drives across the country, training and equipping Israel’s frontline civilian responders in firefighting, first aid, and self-defense. But needing help, Alon turned to Israel Support Bridge and its supply chain. 'Before long I had a full 747 plane land in Israel under my name, and after that two planes every week,' Mammon explained. The partnership 'enables buying in bulk: medical equipment, vests, firefighting support, whatever people need. The mechanism was always the same, working together, accumulating the resources, and getting the project done. Ultimately, we’re two big nonprofits working together towards the same goal,' Tirer said. 'Its’ one of those cases where one plus one is ten.'

EU’s anti-Israel foreign minister steps down	Josep Borrell was a fierce critic whose last statements demanded that all EU states enforce ICC arrest warrants against Israeli leaders. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Josep Borrell, the EU’s ‘foreign minister,’ stepped down Saturday as his five-year term came to an end, causing most Israelis to breathe a sigh of relief. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy had been a fierce critic of the Jewish state, especially over its conduct of the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Some detractors call the Spanish politician 'obsessed' with Israel, rather than focusing on problems much closer to home. Ynet counted Borrell’s posts about the Palestinians and Israel and found that in the last nine months he had tweeted 127 times about it, twice as many as about the Ukraine-Russia war on the EU doorstep that has the real potential of spilling over into neighboring, member states. The posts are full of condemnations of Israeli 'massacres' and other unproven allegations, with barely a nod to the fact that Hamas sparked the ongoing war by brutally massacring 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians, and taking 251 hostage in a surprise invasion last October 7, with 101 still being held captive. He has also called for concrete action to be taken to put pressure on the Jewish state to end the war and the 'humanitarian crisis' in the enclave. At an EU foreign ministers’ meeting earlier this month, Borrell proposed the suspension of political dialogue with Israel and a ban on importing 'products from illegal settlements' due to its alleged human rights violations in the Gaza Strip, which Jerusalem strongly denies. It did not pass because such decisions must be unanimous, and several states did not support the motion, including Germany, Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic. As his final act, on Thursday Borrell said all EU member states must 'support fully the International [Criminal] Court' and not 'undermine' its arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant on war crimes charges relating the Israel-Hamas war. Several EU members have said they will not arrest the two if they visit, including Hungary and France. Borrell also castigated Israeli society, saying it was 'being colonized from the inside by extremism and violent people.' The outgoing foreign minister has been leading the effort to financially sanction Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria on the basis of unproven accusations of harming Palestinians in the region, following the lead of the Biden administration. Former prime minister of Estonia Kaja Kallas, who is considered much more amenable to Israel, will be the EU’s new foreign policy chief.

Zamir Burke, 20, a squad commander in the 401st Brigade’s 601st Combat Engineering Battalion, from Beit Shemesh. By JNS An Israel Defense Forces soldier was killed and another seriously wounded in the northern Gaza Strip on Saturday, the Israeli military said on Sunday. A member of the 7th Armored Brigade’s 46th Battalion was severely wounded in a separate incident in southern Gaza. The fatality was identified as Staff Sgt. Zamir Burke, 20, a squad commander in the 401st Brigade’s 601st Combat Engineering Battalion, from Beit Shemesh. A member of the 401st Brigade’s 82nd Battalion was severely wounded during operational activity in northern Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The wounded soldiers were evacuated to hospital for medical treatment and their families notified. The IDF’s total casualty count on all fronts since the start of the war stands at 807.

Israeli minister issues ultimatum on hostage deal, pushes for tra...	Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir says Netanyahu starting to warm up to idea of encouraging Arab emigration from Gaza, warns his party could bolt government if current Gaza ceasefire deal under consideration is accepted. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's National Security Minister warned that his party would not accept the outline for a ceasefire deal with Hamas currently under consideration, hinting that his faction would bolt Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government if it were to be accepted. Speaking with Army Radio on Sunday, Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) pushed back against a new proposal, presented by an Egyptian delegation, for a limited ceasefire and hostage deal. According to reports last week, the deal would include a two-month truce in the Gaza Strip, the release of some number - possibly several dozen - of the 101 captives still held in the Gaza Strip, and a parallel release of hundreds of jailed Palestinian Arab terrorists held by Israel. The plan marks a significant change from prior proposals, in that Israel would not be obliged to agree to a permanent end to the war, though the new outline would provide for talks during the two-month ceasefire for a long-term cessation of fighting in Gaza. Ben-Gvir, however, objected to the release of large numbers of jailed terrorists in exchange for only some of the remaining Israeli captives, saying the new proposal was 'irrelevant' as far as he is concerned, hinting Otzma Yehudit would bolt the government should the deal be accepted. 'I believe that a reckless deal that would release 1,000 prisoners from the Sinwar group is a severe blow to the State of Israel. Stop misleading the public; this is not even on the table as far as Hamas is concerned,' Ben-Gvir said. 'The deal currently being discussed does not bring back all the hostages. To retrieve all the hostages, the war must completely stop, and secondly, 1,000 prisoners from the Sinwar group would have to be released.' Ben-Gvir intimated that Prime Minister Netanyahu would not agree to the deal over Otzma Yehudit's opposition. 'I am not willing to accept the deal currently being proposed. The terms being discussed are irrelevant to me—and the Prime Minister does not want Otzma Yehudit to leave the government.' Netanyahu, Ben-Gvir continued, 'understands politics very well.' Late last month, Ben-Gvir cast the sole vote in Israel's security cabinet opposing the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. The ceasefire deal was passed by the security cabinet by a margin of 10-1, with the backing of Ben-Gvir's election ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party). In Sunday's interview, Ben-Gvir called for long-term Israeli control of the Gaza Strip, the restoration of Jewish settlement in the area, and a policy of encouraging voluntary Arab emigration or 'transfer' from the coastal enclave. 'Ideas like the resettlement of Gaza have my blessing. The only times we defeated our enemies were when we took land from them. But for me, that’s not enough—I also want to encourage migration, for them to voluntarily emigrate to their countries.' Ben-Gvir suggested that Prime Minister Netanyahu, who in the past has publicly opposed plans to transfer Gaza's population, is now starting to warm to the idea of encouraging voluntary mass emigration. 'And you know what? I’m working hard with the Prime Minister to advance the encouragement of migration from Gaza—and I’m starting to see a certain openness from him on this matter.' 'I’m saying that he is showing openness to something he previously opposed, and I think the time has come to do such a thing.'

IDF laying groundwork for long-term control of Gaza Strip – repor...	Two military bases and a north-south buffer strip have joined the Netzarim and Philadelphi roads over the last several months. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF zones that the army’s engineers have created within the Gaza Strip over the last year show that it’s serious about maintaining security control of the enemy territory for at least the medium-term, the Swiss Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) reported Friday. By examining satellite imagery, the daily drew a clear picture of the new roads and infrastructure Israel has built in order to help the army’s efforts against the Hamas terrorists, as well as ensure security for Israeli citizens after the war is over. Only a few weeks into the ground incursion into Gaza, which began in late October, 2023, troops started blowing up the buildings within a kilometer of the border to create a buffer zone for the kibbutzim and moshavim whose fields and home came within meters sometimes of the original fence. By now, reported NZZ, approximately 90% of a north-south, kilometer-wide strip has been razed to the ground. The Philadelphi Corridor on the Egyptian-Gazan border that had been the main smuggling route for Hamas weaponry, both over and under the ground, has been turned into a constantly patrolled, two-lane, paved road, enabling the IDF to shut down this 'oxygen pipeline,' as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dubbed it. The biggest project has been the Netzarim Corridor, which cuts completely through the Strip about a third of the way down from its northern tip, through the outer parts of Gaza City. The seven-kilometer-long road is wide, well-paved, and protected by earthen embankments in certain sections on either side. There are also watchtowers and at least two army bases dotting its flanks. Buildings have been steadily demolished all around the road to a form a secure zone five to six kilometers wide. The corridor started as the answer to a tactical need but is now 'a strategic element,' Mitvim think-tank president Nimrod Goren told the paper. 'It also serves to divide the territory, to control the movement of the Palestinian population, to enable ongoing action against Hamas infrastructure and to show that Israel will not be leaving any time soon.' This differs, for example, from several short access roads from Israeli territory, mostly to heavily populated areas like Gaza City, Khan Younis and Rafah, that have also been constructed. Security experts NZZ interviewed said these were likely only tactical in nature, to ease army operations, and would not be maintained long-term. Despite its importance to Israeli security, even the well-built southern road may not become a permanent fixture, according to Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies in King's College London. 'Given the international significance of the Philadelphia corridor – where the interests of Israel, Egypt and the U.S. converge – this issue is likely to be resolved through negotiations,' he told NZZ. The Biden administration has maintained that Israel cannot remain as an occupying power in Gaza after Hamas has been destroyed, and that no land could be subtracted from the Palestinians as a result of the war. Netanyahu has said Israel would not reoccupy Gaza, but that no matter who runs the coastal entity in the future – something far from being settled as yet – Israel would have to retain 'security responsibility' there so that the residents of the south can live there safely again. His national-religious coalition partners are of a different opinion, saying that Israel should resettle areas evacuated in the 2005 unilateral Disengagement, as they believe this is the only way to successfully maintain Israel’s security in the long term. On Thursday, Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party joined them, saying that 'Jewish settlement here is the answer to the terrible [Oct. 7] massacre and to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.' Some 53% of Jewish Israelis support the reestablishment of Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip, according to the 'Peace Index' survey released by Tel Aviv University in January.

Israelis in Thailand facing high threat of terror attacks	A number of Iranian plots to harm Israelis abroad have been thwarted in recent years by the Mossad and other Israeli intelligence agencies. By World Israel News Staff Israelis currently vacationing in Thailand were urged to remain vigilant, as the 'terrorist infrastructure' which orchestrated the murder of an Israeli rabbi in the United Arab Emirates are seeking to harm Israelis in the southeast Asian nation, according to Israel's National Security Council (NSC). 'Current intelligence indicates that the terrorists responsible for the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan in Dubai&#8230;have been planning further terrorist activity,' read a statement from the NSC. The NSC warning may refer to Iran, which has formally denied responsibility for Kogan's slaying, but is believed by some Israeli security officials to have organized the murder. A number of Iranian plots to harm Israelis abroad have been thwarted in recent years by the Mossad and other Israeli intelligence agencies. The warning that terrorist elements are actively plotting to attack Israelis in Thailand comes two weeks after the Mossad specifically warned Israeli tourists to avoid the famous Full Moon Party, due to the threat of attacks. Thailand is an extremely popular vacation destination for Israelis, with hundreds of thousands visiting the country annually. Some Thai islands, such as Ko Samui, have small Israeli expat communities. Israelis must 'avoid attending large-scale events associated with Israel, with an emphasis on those announced in advance, or places of entertainment and gathering associated with Israel. Notify local security forces if you are exposed to hostile activity targeting Israelis,' the NSC said. The NSC told Israelis to be 'extra alert in public places,' such as restaurants, hotels, and bars. The agency also advised Israelis to hide symbols of their Jewish and Israeli identities, as well as avoid mentioning their military service or posting details of their vacation - such as the names of their hotels - on public social media profiles.

Kidnappers murdered UAE rabbi after botched abduction – report	Uzbeki kidnappers had planned to smuggle Rabbi Zvi Kogan across the border into Oman but murdered him after their abduction plan went awry, according to Wall Street Journal report. By World Israel News Staff The suspects responsible for the abduction and murder of a rabbi in the United Arab Emirates had planned to transfer him across the border to Oman, but killed him after their plans went awry, according to a report published by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday. On the morning of November 21st, Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a dual Israeli-Moldovan citizen serving as aide to the chief rabbi of the United Arab Emirates and the proprietor of a kosher grocery shop in Abu Dhabi, was abducted and driven in his own car by his kidnappers towards the border with Oman. Days later, his remains were found in his car en route to the border, with clear signs he had been murdered. Relatives and friends who spoke with the Journal said Rabbi Kogan's death was 'a bloody end,' without offering details. According to Sunday's report, the three suspects linked to the killing had planned on smuggling the 28-year-old rabbi over the border - alive - to Oman, but were ultimately foiled. It remains unclear what prevented the three Uzbeki nationals linked to the case from crossing the border with Rabbi Kogan, leading to his murder. UAE security forces arrested the three suspects last week, just days after Rabbi Kogan was declared missing. The UAE's Ministry of the Interior identified the three suspects as Olembay Toyirovich, 28, Mahmoud Abd Rahim, 28, and Azizet Kamalovich, 33, and released a photograph of three in custody. Some Israeli officials cited by Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, have speculated that while the abduction and killing bear the hallmarks of a terrorist organization, the terror cell responsible may not be linked to Iran.

Former Israeli defense minister accuses Israel of ‘ethnically cle...	Moshe Ya'alon, a former member of the Likud who served as Defense Minister under Netanyahu after stint as IDF chief of staff, accuses Israeli government of promoting 'occupation, annexation, ethnic cleansing of Gaza.' By World Israel News Staff A former Israeli defense minister and ex-member of the ruling Likud party accused the Israeli government over the weekend of working towards the 'ethnic cleansing' of the Gaza Strip. Speaking with Democrat TV on Saturday, Moshe Ya'alon accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition government of planning to occupy, then annex, the Gaza Strip, restore Jewish settlement in the coastal enclave, and ethnically cleanse it of Palestinian Arabs. 'The path we are being dragged down is one of occupation, annexation and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip,' Ya'alon said. 'Transfer, call it what you want, and Jewish settlements.' Ya'alon claimed that a majority of Israelis reject proposals by members of the Israeli government to maintain long-term Israeli control over the Gaza Strip, to resettle the area, or to promote voluntary migration of Palestinian Arabs. 'Now look at the polls. Seventy percent — sometimes more and sometimes a little less — of the public in the State of Israel advocates a path that is Jewish, democratic, liberal etc., and also with separation.' 'Therefore, there must be no confusion here. The one who wants to confuse us is the one who is currently leading us to nothing less than destruction.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls by some of his ministers, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) to apply Israeli sovereignty over the Gaza Strip, to resettle the area, or to pursue the voluntary transfer of the Arab population. When the host, Arab-Israeli journalist Lucy Aharish, pushed back on Ya'alon's claims of ethnic cleansing, the former general doubled down on his accusation. 'What is happening there? What is happening there? There is no Beit Lahia, there is no Beit Hanoun, [the IDF] is currently operating in Jabalia and are essentially cleansing the area of ​​Arabs.' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar (New Hope), a long-time rival of Netanyahu who recently joined the government, castigated Ya'alon over his comments, tweeting: 'The irresponsible comments of former minister Moshe Ya’alon are incorrect and slander Israel without a basis. I call on him to retract his comments.' Ya'alon, 74, was a career officer in the IDF, serving in the military from 1968 until his retirement in 2005. He rose to the rank of lieutenant general and served as chief of staff from 2002 to 2005, when he resigned in protest over the Gaza Disengagement plan. Four years later, Ya'alon entered politics, running on the Likud ticket and serving as Strategic Affairs Minister and Defense Minister under Prime Minister Netanyahu from 2009-2013 and 2013-2016 respectively. After his tenure as defense chief, however, Ya'alon became a fierce critic of Netanyahu, leaving the Likud and forming the Telem party, which later ran on a joint ticket with Benny Gantz's Blue and White party. During 2023, Ya'alon frequently joined protests against the judicial reform plan, accusing the Israeli government of behaving like a 'dictatorship of criminals.'

Sirens activated in central Israel due to Yemen-launched missile	Sirens heard in central cities near airport, Jerusalem suburb for first time since Hezbollah ceasefire came into effect. By World Israel News Staff Air raid sirens warning of incoming missile fire sounded throughout central Israel on Sunday morning, breaking several days of relative quiet following the implementation of a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. According to an Israeli army statement, the sirens were activated by a ballistic missile launched from Yemen by Houthi terrorists, who are backed by Iran. The IDF said that the missile had been successfully intercepted outside of Israel's borders, but the alarms sounded due to concerns of falling shrapnel. Sirens sounded in major cities including the central cities of Modi'in, Lod, which is near Ben Gurion Airport, and Beit Shemesh, a Jerusalem suburb. Hebrew-language news outlet Mako reported that Magen David Adom paramedics were treating several people who had been hurt while running to bomb shelters, as well as a number of individuals who were suffering from acute anxiety. Last week, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi said the Hezbollah ceasefire should inspire other Shia terror groups in the region to attack Israel. 'It is important to build on what was achieved on the Lebanese front and move toward further escalation [against Israel], particularly from Iraq and Yemen,' al-Houthi said. Since the outbreak of the October 7th war, the Houthis fired more than 200 explosive drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles at Israel. The group has often exaggerated the results of these launches, including falsely claiming to hit sensitive sites such as the Nevatim Air Base in southern Israel. In June, one Houthi-launched drone managed to reach Tel Aviv and crashed some 200 meters away from the American consulate, killing an Israeli man. 'The Yemeni Armed Forces will carry out more military operations against the Israeli enemy in triumph for the blood of our people in Palestine and Lebanon, and will not stop supportive military operations during the coming days until the Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon stops,' Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said in a statement following a missile in launch in September, which was intercepted and caused no injuries or damage.

Iran leveraging ceasefire to rebuild Hezbollah – report	After the terror group's heavy losses in the recent conflict, it is more dependent than ever on Iranian support to survive. By World Israel News Staff Iran is using the current ceasefire as an opportunity to rebuild and rearm Hezbollah, its largest proxy group on Israel's northern border, as well as activate other Shia militias in the region to attack Israel. Despite bombastic statements from Hezbollah declaring victory over Israel, Iran views the terror group has having lost to Israel, as over 4,000 of its members were killed and thousands more were wounded. While some have suggested that Iran may cut its losses and focus on its other proxy groups - such as the Houthis in Yemen and various Shia militias in Iraq and Syria - one Iran expert noted the long-term investment that Tehran has made in Hezbollah. 'The Iranian relationship with Hezbollah doesn’t end with this defeat to Israeli forces,' Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at London’s Chatham House think tank, told the Post. 'This is a relationship that was nurtured and cultivated over decades. The relationship will certainly live on.' Within Hezbollah, there is some lingering anger over Iran's lack of direct intervention to spare the terror group from heavy losses during the conflict with Israel. Though Iran flew Hezbollah terrorists for treatment in Iranian hospitals after the beeper explosions, Iran did not directly attack Israel in order to save the terror group. Many in Lebanon have expressed anger over Hezbollah for bringing Iranian influence into the country and its parliament, in which Hezbollah's political branch has representatives. Hezbollah loyalists have argued that the terror group is a Lebanese-born 'liberation group,' aiming to protect Lebanon from Israeli aggression. But after the terror group's heavy losses in the recent conflict, it is more dependent than ever on Iranian support to rebuild. 'Iran is prepared to allocate funds for reconstruction and to ensure Hezbollah’s survival, as well as to maintain support within the Shiite community,' a person with inside knowledge of Hezbollah's internal politics told the Washington Post. 'However, this support is now more directly under Iranian influence,' he added, explaining that Hezbollah believes Iran will send field agents to ensure that the funding is being used properly, as well as to provide military training to surviving members of the terror group.

Mother of hostage: UN ceasefire resolution would have been a ‘dea...	The UN recently attempted to pass a ceasefire resolution that did not include a demand for the release of the hostages. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Mandy Damari, mother of British-Israeli citizen Emily Damari, described the UN's proposed ceasefire as a 'death sentence' for the hostages still in Gaza. Speaking at a rally on Saturday night at the Sha'ar Hanegev Junction, Damari described traveling to Geneva and meeting with United Nations, Red Cross, and Human Rights Council officials. She recounted being at the UN on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, 'a day dedicated to standing against injustice. Yet, if there's any place where injustice is overlooked, and falsehoods thrive, it's here.' Damari said, 'The UN recently attempted to pass a ceasefire resolution that did not include a demand for the release of the hostages. If not for the US veto, that resolution would have passed—and it would have effectively been a death sentence for our loved ones. Hamas would have had no incentive to release them.' She continued, 'We told the UN what they didn't want to hear: they're failing. The Red Cross has failed. Not one hostage has received humanitarian aid, not one has been visited, and not one family has gotten any sign of life. If these organizations had done their jobs, our loved ones would be home by now. Instead, we're met with excuses, false support, and empty promises.' Damari said she was flying to the UK and would ask government officials why they supported the UN resolution. Currently, Emily Damari is the only British citizen left of the 101 hostages remaining in Gaza. Speaking of the British government, Damari said, 'They told me three weeks ago they would fight for her. So where is that fight now? Were they actually speaking the truth when they told me they are fighting for her to return home?'

High-ranking UAE official attends Rabbi Zvi Kogan’s shiva	During the shiva call, Nuaimi stressed that his country will continue to seek coexistence and will not let extremists threaten this goal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, a senior representative of the United Arab Emirates, arrived in Jerusalem on Friday to pay his respects to terror victim rabbi Zvi Kogan, Israel Hayom reports. Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi visited the Kogan family sitting shiva, a seven-day Jewish mourning observance. During the shiva call, Nuaimi stressed that his country will continue to seek coexistence and will not let extremists threaten this goal. 'The state and its citizens are more committed than ever to the values of openness and peace and will increase their efforts to ensure that Rabbi Zvi's legacy continues and that all communities live in harmony in the UAE,' the senior official said. Former Israeli Ambassador to the UAE, Amir Hayek, joined Nuaimi's visit to the Kogan family home. On Sunday, following the discovery of Rabbi Kogan's body, Emirati Ambassador to the United States Yousef Al-Otaiba said in a statement, 'Our thoughts are with his family, friends, and community over his senseless death. Zvi Kogan's murder was more than a crime in the UAE – it was a crime against the UAE. It was an attack on our homeland, on our values, and on our vision.' 'In the UAE, we welcome everyone. We embrace peaceful coexistence. We reject extremism and fanaticism of every kind. We honor Zvi Kogan's memory by recommitting ourselves to these values.' 'Now, we are more determined than ever to protecting and sustaining the Emirates as a shining and enduring example of diversity, acceptance and peace.' Last Thursday, 28-year-old Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan, who served as an aide to the chief rabbi of the UAE and operated a kosher grocery shop in Abu Dhabi, was declared missing. Over the weekend, his body was found by UAE security personnel in a suspected terror attack.

IDF announces new ultra-orthodox brigade to launch during Chanuka...	The goal is to grow the Hashmonaim Brigade's number of combat soldiers to a unit of 60 to 80 with ultra-orthodox reserve soldiers engaged in extended training. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF announced the launch of an entirely ultra-orthodox combat unit called the Hashmonaim Brigade on Chanukah, Ynet reports. The release on Chanukah is appropriate, given that the Hasmonaim historically was the dynasty that led the Maccabean revolt against the Syrian-Greeks, commemorated during the Chanukah holiday. The brigade includes 30 pre-screened recruits, with dozens of others expressing interest in joining. The goal is to grow the Hashmonaim Brigade's number of combat soldiers to a unit of 60 to 80 with ultra-orthodox reserve soldiers engaged in extended training. The Hashmoniam focuses on voluntary recruitment of ultra-orthodox soldiers following a dialogue with heads of yeshivas and community rabbis rather than through compulsory enlistment, as occurred with the 7,000 recently issued draft orders in the ultra-orthodox community. The focus is on fostering trust between the ultra-orthodox community and Israel's military with a commitment to assisting and requiring the religious troops to adhere to their strict religious observance. The soldiers are expected to practice modest speech, use only filtered cell phones, and wear their traditional ultra-orthodox attire at prayer and meals. Any violation of these rules will result in dismissal from regular army service. All training will occur within the Hashmonaim Brigade to avoid intermingling with other units and a relaxation of standards. Col. Avinoam Emunah, commander of the Hashmonaim Brigade, told Ynet, 'I have the privilege of commanding the ultra-Orthodox brigade and being part of this extraordinary project that has the potential to bring meaningful change to Israeli society and the Jewish people as a whole.' 'For the first time since the founding of the IDF and the establishment of the state, we've created a brigade that allows the ultra-Orthodox community to enlist, fight and serve while preserving their way of life and their identity. I invite you—those who feel the calling to defend their land, their people and their country—to join us and take part in something historic, something unprecedented. Be part of the beginning of this blessing,' he added.

IDF strikes Syria and Lebanon citing ceasefire violations	The IDF vowed to deal swiftly with any violations of the ceasefire agreement, including the transfer of weapons. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Saturday, the IAF struck targets in Syria and Lebanon, citing violations of the days-old ceasefire agreement. The strike in Syria took place close to the border in Lebanon, which Israel said Hezbollah was using to transfer weapons. In a statement, Israel's military said, 'The action was taken after identifying the transfer of weapons from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon, which continued even after the ceasefire agreement. This transfer represents a threat to the State of Israel and violates the terms of the ceasefire.' Syrian media said the strikes occurred close to the al-Qusayr area, although Israeli sources didn't specify what kind of facilities were hit. The IDF vowed to deal swiftly with any violations of the ceasefire agreement, including the transfer of weapons. 'The IDF will continue to act to remove any threat to the State of Israel that violates the terms of the ceasefire agreement,' the military added. The strikes come as instability erupts in Syria with insurgents breaching Aleppo. Israel's military also struck at observed ceasefire violators in Lebanon as they noticed Hezbollah terrorists loading a car with RPG, ammunition boxes, and other military equipment. The IDF also noticed Hezbollah terrorists in a building that the terrorist group previously used. Also on Saturday, the IAF struck at a facility near Sidon, which Hezbollah used to store rocket launchers. The IDF carried out a drone strike 'deep within Lebanon' against a vehicle at a facility Hezbollah used to manufacture missiles. Israel's military in Lebanon also discovered a cache of weapons stored at a mosque. They also dismissed Hezbollah terrorists spotted in the no-go area in Southern Lebanon. Lebanese media also accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire agreement and claimed an Israeli drone attacked a car in the southern village of Majdal Zoun, wounding three people.

Prison escapee convicted of passing UK military secrets to Iran	While Khalife claimed most information he shared was fabricated or publicly available, prosecutors used evidence from his phones, notes, and surveillance footage to prove he had gathered and shared real classified information. By Jewish Breaking News A former British soldier who made headlines with a daring escape from a London prison was convicted Thursday of spying for Iran. Daniel Khalife, 23, was found guilty by a jury in Woolwich Crown Court of violating Britain’s Official Secrets Act and Terrorism Act. The 23-year-old joined the Army at 16, serving in the Royal Corps of Signals, a communications unit working with battlefield troops and special forces. He received NATO secret security clearance during a joint exercise at Fort Cavazos in Texas in early 2021, during which time he shared intelligence information with his Iranian handlers. British security only learned of his Iranian contacts after he approached MI6, anonymously offering to work as a double agent. He claimed he had earned his handlers’ trust and received $2,000 in a dog poo bag in a north London park. While Khalife claimed most information he shared was fabricated or publicly available, prosecutors used evidence from his phones, notes, and surveillance footage to prove he had gathered and shared real classified information. They also showed he traveled to Turkey to meet a contact. In his testimony, Khalife said he had contacted people in the Iranian government after he got the idea from watching 'Homeland,' a Showtime television drama about CIA operations and espionage. His defense lawyer, Gul Nawaz Hussein, characterized Khalife’s James Bond aspirations as naive and stupid, bordering on slapstick. He said his client was more 'Scooby Doo' than '007.' Despite the seemingly amateur nature of his actions, Counter Terrorism Commander Dominic Murphy of the Metropolitan Police stressed Khalife’s dangerousness. 'We know very well the threat that Iranians pose to the U.K.’s national security,' Murphy said. 'He’s the ultimate Walter Mitty character who was having a significant impact in the real world.' The case gained widespread attention after Khalife’s September 2023 prison break, when he escaped from Wandsworth Prison by strapping himself under a delivery truck. After a massive three-day search, authorities caught him on a canal path. His escape exposed broader issues in Britain’s aging, overcrowded prison system, prompting an ongoing inquiry into how he managed to escape and whether he had help. Though Khalife owned up to his prison break during the proceedings, his denials of espionage fell flat with the jury. 'He surreptitiously sought out and obtained copies of secret and sensitive information which he knew were protected and passed these on to individuals he believed to be acting on behalf of the Iranian state,' said Bethan David of the Crown Prosecution Service. 'The sharing of the information could have exposed military personnel to serious harm, or a risk to life, and prejudiced the safety and security of the United Kingdom.'

Maccabi Tel Aviv plays soccer game in empty Hungarian stadium ami...	The match on Thursday was Maccabi Tel Aviv’s first game in Europe since its fans were violently attacked in The Netherlands during the late hours of Nov. 7 and into the early hours of the following morning. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel Aviv played a UEFA Europa League match on Thursday against their Turkish rivals Besiktas in an empty stadium in Hungary, which was closed to supporters likely due to security concerns following the recent attack on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam. Maccabi won the match 3-1 in the Nagyerdei Stadium in Debrecen, Hungary, during the fifth week of the UEFA Europa League. Gavriel Kanichowsky secured Israel’s lead in the 23rd minute with a goal, but Besiktas struck back in the 38th minute with a goal by Rafa Silva to tie the score. Maccabi Tel Aviv took the lead again right before halftime by scoring another goal in added time. The Israeli club finished 3-1 with Weslley Patati’s goal in the 81st minute. Groups of police patrolled outside the venue and the game concluded with no incident, according to the Associated Press. On Nov. 11, days after the attack against Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam, the European soccer body UEFA announced that this week’s match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Besiktas, which was originally scheduled to take place in Istanbul, would be moved to Hungary 'following a decision by the Turkish authorities not to stage it in Turkey.' Hungary, which has hosted several home games for Israel’s national soccer team since the start of the Israel-Hamas war last year, agreed to host the match and UEFA said it 'will be played behind closed doors following a decision of the local Hungarian authorities.' Maccabi Tel Aviv coach Zarko Lazetic said after Thursday’s match that playing in front of an empty stadium was hard for the team. 'We play football because of the fans, to give them some pleasure, some excite(ment) and to be together,' he explained, as reported by the AP. The match on Thursday was Maccabi Tel Aviv’s first game in Europe since its fans were violently attacked in The Netherlands during the late hours of Nov. 7 and into the early hours of the following morning. After the team competed against the Dutch club Ajax in a UEFA Europa League game in Amsterdam, anti-Israel gangs chased Israeli fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv through the streets of Amsterdam, ran them over with cars, physically assaulted them, and taunted Israeli soccer fans with anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian slogans such as 'Free Palestine.' Five people were reportedly hospitalized for injuries. Leaders in Israel and Europe condemned the premeditated and coordinated attack as antisemitic. Amsterdam’s mayor called the attackers 'antisemitic hit-and-run squads' and said the assailants were going 'Jew hunting.' Police in Amsterdam said they have already identified, investigated, and even arrested 45 suspects in connection to the incident. Following his team’s loss on Thursday to Maccabi Tel Aviv, Besiktas President Hasan Arat resigned from the soccer club, citing 'personal reasons.' He was elected president in December 2023. Earlier this week, former Premier League goalkeeper Brad Friedel was fired as sporting director of the Turkish team after having the job for only five months.

UK, France, Germany vow to continue nuke talks with Iran	According to a November report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Tehran had 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since its last report in August. By Amelie Botbol, JNS Britain, France and Germany have agreed to continue nuclear negotiations with Tehran following a meeting on Friday in Geneva and amid threats by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to reinstitute a 'maximum pressure' campaign on the Islamic Republic once he assumes office in January. Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister and senior nuclear negotiator Majid Takht-Ravanchi met with top diplomats from the European nations, known collectively as the E3. The talks came after the European countries joined the United States to have Iran censured by the U.N. atomic watchdog for its lack of cooperation. The resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency’s 35-nation Board of Governors notes an 'essential and urgent' need for Iran to provide 'technically credible explanations' for the uranium traces at undeclared facilities. It also urges the IAEA to compile 'a comprehensive and updated assessment on the possible presence or use of undeclared nuclear material in connection with past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran’s nuclear program.' According to a November report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Tehran had 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since its last report in August. This level of enrichment is a technical step short of 90% enrichment, considered weapons grade. Iran condemned the censure as 'politically motivated' and announced the launch of 'new advanced centrifuges' to produce additional enriched uranium. Last week, Britain’s foreign intelligence chief said that Tehran’s nuclear ambitions posed a major global threat. 'Iran’s allied militias across the Middle East have suffered serious blows,' said Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) chief Sir Richard Moore, adding, 'But the regime’s nuclear ambitions continue to threaten all of us.' Similarly, the head of France’s DGSI intelligence service warned of the risk of Iran’s nuclear breakout, noting that Paris and London were preparing for such an eventuality. 'Our services are working side by side to face what is undoubtedly one of the threats, if not to say the most critical threat, in the coming months—the possible atomic proliferation in Iran,' Nicolas Lerner said. 'The intelligence will be crucial to enable our authorities to make the right decisions and define the right strategies.' In an interview with The Guardian newspaper published on Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that his country was considering altering its nuclear policy. The threat came after an adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said earlier this month that Tehran has the capacity to develop nuclear weapons, should it choose to do so. 'We now have the technical capabilities necessary to produce nuclear weapons,' Kamal Kharrazi told the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen outlet. In May, Kharrazi told the ISNA news agency: 'If the Zionist regime dares to damage Iran’s nuclear facilities, our level of deterrence will be different. We have no decision to produce a nuclear bomb, but if the existence of Iran is threatened, we will have to change our nuclear doctrine.' In August, Iran International reported that the Islamic Republic was advancing its secret nuclear program, bringing the mullahs closer to building atomic bombs. Three independent sources in Iran told the London-based opposition media outlet that the regime was moving forward with its nuclear weapons program 'by restructuring the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), retaining Mohammad Eslami as the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and resuming tests to produce nuclear bomb detonators.' The Biden administration privately warned Tehran in June about its research and development activities, Axios reported on July 17, citing three Israeli and U.S. officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Jerusalem would do 'everything' to stop Tehran from acquiring the bomb. 'I will do everything to prevent it from becoming a nuclear [power], I will use all the resources that can be used,' the premier said. Earlier this month, Netanyahu told a Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee meeting that Israel would review its ability to act against Iran once the Trump administration takes over. During his first term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Obama-era accord more commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, which he said did not sufficiently prevent a pathway to an Iranian bomb. In October, Israeli airstrikes on Iran destroyed a secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin, 19 miles southeast of Tehran, according to Axios. The clandestine site held sophisticated equipment used for testing explosives needed to detonate nuclear devices.

Netanyahu, Gallant should turn themselves in, ICC spokesman tells...	This week, Netanyahu decided to appeal to the ICC against the decision to issue the arrest warrants. By Amichai Stein, JNS 'The suspects can decide to appear on a voluntary basis and surrender to the ICC. They have all the rights of the defense that are guaranteed, including the presumption of innocence.' That’s what Fadi El Abdallah, the spokesperson and head of the Public Affairs Unit at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, told JNS when asked what is expected now from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, now that the ICC has issued warrants for their arrest on charges of genocide. 'There is an arrest warrant that has been issued for the individuals, and it is the legal obligation of the states that are parties to the Rome Statute to cooperate with us,' El Abdallah continued. (Israel is not a party to the treaty that established the court—A.S.) But how is it possible, JNS asked, that only Israeli leaders are standing trial in connection to the Gaza war (an arrest warrant was also issued for Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, but he is dead). ICC Spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah. Credit: Academy for Cultural Diplomacy/Facebook. 'The ICC is checking if during a war crimes have been committed, and who is responsible. Even in wars there are rules that need to be applied to everyone,' El Abdallah said. 'The judges simply decided based of the evidence and based on the rules.' Will U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to sanction all those involved in the arrest warrants affect the court’s decision, JNS asks. 'The ICC has a legal mandate and we have to fulfill it. There are 124 states that gave the ICC a specific mandate to serve justice and to serve victims, and we have to fulfill our duty. We cannot take any political matters into consideration. We can only look at things with total independence and impartiality,' the spokesman responded. But still, JNS asked, you see countries such as France and Germany saying they won’t arrest Netanyahu and Gallant. You cannot say this doesn’t damage the court credibility or authority. 'As I said,' El Abdallah replied, 'no political matters can be taken into consideration. The judges are independent and impartial and will only decide based on the applicable legal rules and the evidence that are before them.' If there are requests of the ICC in relation to the implementation of its decision, they have to be raised with the judges, who will then decide on them, the Lebanese spokesperson added. A state commission of inquiry? Some in Israel claim that if only there were a state commission of inquiry into the events of Oct. 7, 2023, and its aftermath headed by the president of the Supreme Court, the arrest warrants would not have been issued. 'The arrest warrants have been issued,' the ICC spokesperson said. 'They cannot be withdrawn unless by the judges themselves based on a strong legal argumentation. If there is a request to the ICC judges, then they will have to check if all the conditions are met. But the general rules are that there is a need to establish that there are indeed genuine investigations for the same individuals and for the same alleged actions as indicated by the [ICC] decision.' Israel is not one of the 124 countries that signed the Rome Statute. This simple fact raised many eyebrows: How can the court put on trial the leaders of a country that is not within its jurisdiction? 'The ICC does not prosecute states, but it persecutes individuals for alleged criminal responsibility,' El Abdallah told JNS. 'The ICC jurisdiction covers the Palestinian territories, so Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and that means that when the state of Palestine ratified the Rome Statute [in 2015], if crimes are committed by anyone on the territory of Palestine, they can be prosecuted.' JNS then asked: You understand that the Israeli public sees the arrest warrant decision as antisemitic and anti-Israel, especially as it’s based on the decision, which was widely criticized, of the Palestinian Authority joining the court. The prestige of the judicial system? MK Simcha Rothman, who chairs the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, told JNS, 'I think it is very, very clear that it would not have mattered whether Israel had established a state commission of inquiry or whether it would have established a civil committee. 'Essentially what the spokesperson is claiming is that an investigation on the suspicious of genocide or crimes against humanity should have been opened [by Israel] against Gallant and Netanyahu—which of course no country would do. And of course, this shows that the claims of supporters of the [Israeli] judicial system, that the prestige of the judicial system could save us from the ICC, are untrue,' Rothman said. This week, Netanyahu decided to appeal to the ICC against the decision to issue the arrest warrants. 'I think there is no need to appeal. The very act of appealing to the ICC judges gives it treatment it does not deserve,' Rothman told JNS. 'This is an illegitimate body, and it should be treated as such. And we should act diplomatically with countries and use this incident as an opportunity to take steps against both the court and the perpetrator of the trial in the court, which is the Palestinian Authority.' Rothman said this is a golden opportunity to weaken the ICC. 'By imposing sanctions and delegitimizing the court, it will cause more countries to leave the court. Many people understand that this step will be used against them as well, so it should be used to harm the court,' he said. Amichai Stein is the diplomatic correspondent for Kan 11, IPBC.

Hamas may give up on crucial demands for hostage release – NYT	According to reports, Hamas might allow the IDF to occupy the Philadelphi corridor temporarily, something that was a key demand of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but Hamas considered a non-starter. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The New York Times on Thursday reported that Hamas may be willing to drop crucial demands for a hostage-ceasefire agreement. According to the Times, Palestinian and US leadership said they believed that Hamas might allow the IDF to occupy the Philadelphi corridor temporarily, something that was a key demand of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but was considered by Hamas to be a non-starter. In the last few months, Hamas has rejected any hostage release proposal that doesn't include Israel agreeing to an immediate and permanent withdrawal of military forces from Gaza. Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that the group 'appreciates' Lebanon's right to reach an agreement that protects its people and expressed hope for a deal that would end the war in Gaza. 'Hamas appreciates the right of Lebanon and Hezbollah to reach an agreement that protects the people of Lebanon, and we hope that this agreement will pave the way to reaching an agreement that ends the war of genocide against our people in Gaza,' Abu Zuhri stated. Following the implementation of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, US special envoy Amos Hochstein said, 'The Lebanese deal here opens an opportunity on the hostage deal,' he said. 'They [Hamas] wake up this morning at 4 am with Hezbollah, that used to be actively supportive of Hamas in the northern front, cutting a deal and ending that conflict.' In addition to the ceasefire in Lebanon, the death of Sinwar and uncertainty over the future of Hamas's leadership have created a widespread perception that Hamas may be more amenable to a hostage and ceasefire deal. The Times also cited the role of Iran and indicated that since much of the Islamic Republic's air defense systems were damaged by Israeli airstrikes, they may be unwilling to confront Israel. The victory of President-elect Donald Trump was cited as another factor in Iran's reluctance to attack Israel, and it may be more likely to rein in its proxies, such as Hezbollah and Hamas. There are also reports that after a year of war, Hamas has lost its grip on Gaza and that increasing numbers of Gazan civilians are turning on the terror group.

Two terrorists were involved in the shooting at Giti Avisar junction, one of whom was shot dead by security forces and the other is currently being pursued. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A terrorist who opened fire at an Israeli bus stop on Friday near the settlement of Ariel was eliminated by Israeli security forces. Two terrorists were involved in the shooting at Giti Avisar junction, one of whom was shot dead by security forces and the other is currently being pursued. The two terrorists were armed with assault rifles and began shooting suddenly at civilians. Magen Dovid Adom reported that of the eight wounded, four were hit with gunfire, including three in serious condition and one in moderate condition. The remaining people were injured through impact with broken glass. Magen David Adom paramedic Itamar Hakhamov described the scene: 'We arrived in large numbers and found casualties near the bus, fully conscious and suffering from gunshot wounds.' 'We quickly administered initial medical care and transported them to the hospital in stable condition. Other MDA teams treated individuals with shrapnel injuries from broken glass and also evacuated them with minor injuries,' he continued. This is a developing story.

Thousands attend pro-Israel rally in Amsterdam	Naomi Mestrum, the director of the Center for Information and Documentation Israel, a Dutch-Jewish group, thanked Christians for Israel for standing up for Jews and called on others to follow suit. By Canaan Lindor, JNS Thousands of people protested against antisemitism and in support of Jews and Israel on Thursday, at gathering in Amsterdam organized by Christian Zionists and Jewish groups. Police removed several anti-Israel protesters who showed up to confront the crowd at the so-called Stopera complex near the city’s Waterloo Square. The event was headlined 'Together against Jew-Hatred.' The Israel supporters waved Israeli and Dutch flags at the demonstration co-organized by Christians for Israel. Frank van Oordt, the NGO’s director, was one of the speakers who referenced the series of assaults by dozens of Muslims on Israelis returning from a soccer match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax in Amsterdam on Nov. 7. 'We see attempts to blame the Jews for violence against them and we are sick of it,' said van Oordt, whose father, Karel, founded Christians for Israel in 1979. 'We are standing by our Jews now, we do so proudly and we will not stand by as hatred is incited again against them.' Several of the attendees blew a shofar as others applauded van Oordt. Naomi Mestrum, the director of the Center for Information and Documentation Israel, a Dutch-Jewish group, thanked Christians for Israel for standing up for Jews and called on others to follow suit. 'Everyone should be standing by the Jewish people now,' she said. 'We are done talking. The authorities need to show up.' Esther Voet, the editor-in-chief of the Dutch-Jewish weekly NIW, noted that organizers reminded the demonstrators not to display the Israeli flag while leaving the demonstration for fear of attacks. Several speakers criticized Mayor Femke Halsema for revoking the permit the city gave the event’s organizers to hold the protest at Dam Square, a central point where many of the Nov. 7 assaults happened, and have it moved to the less central Stopera area. Halsema, a former leader of the far-left GroenLinks ('GreenLeft') party, cited public order concerns. Last week, Halsema retracted her initial use of the word 'pogrom' to describe the Nov. 7 assaults, where the perpetrators’ violence, use of the term 'Jew hunt' to describe their actions, and level of coordination shocked many witnesses. In recent weeks, politicians on the Dutch left repeated a narrative in which the Israelis instigated or provoked the violence. The victims and many witnesses dispute these allegations.

Israel extends waiver allowing Palestinian banking ties	Israel’s National Security Council said that severing banking ties with the PA would have 'significant negative consequences' for Israel’s security and foreign relations. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Security Cabinet on Thursday night extended a waiver allowing Israeli banks to cooperate with Palestinian ones for another year. The waiver allows Israeli banks to process shekel payments for services and salaries associated with the Palestinian Authority without running afoul of laws against terror-funding and money laundering. Palestinian banks process PA stipends for imprisoned terrorists and their families. Israel came under heavy US and European pressure as diplomats argued that without the waiver, the Palestinian Authority economy would collapse. An opinion presented by Israel’s National Security Council said that severing banking ties with the PA would have 'significant negative consequences' for Israel’s security and foreign relations, warning such a move would increase Palestinian terror financing and money laundering. The new waiver expires at the end of November 2025. The Palestinian Authority allocates seven percent of its annual budget for its so-called 'Martyr’s Fund,' which provides the stipends. The size of the monthly payouts is primarily determined by the duration of the terrorist’s incarceration, with a negligible additional factor based on family size. Ramallah has been paying out stipends for years, but the issue came under a spotlight following the murder of Taylor Force, a U.S. citizen killed by a Palestinian who went on a stabbing rampage in Jaffa in 2018. Congress passed the Taylor Force Act, which halted U.S. aid to the Palestinians as long as terror stipends are being paid out. U.S. assistance to the Palestinian Authority resumed under the administration of President Joe Biden. In December 2022, American victims of Palestinian terror filed a lawsuit against the President and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, arguing that the payments violate the Taylor Force Act. Despite claiming to be operating at a 172% budget deficit, the Palestinian Authority in July recognized 899 new prisoners from Gaza and tens of thousands more Gaza 'martyrs' as eligible for the 'pay for slay' payouts.

Trump team claims credit for Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire	The Biden administration had reportedly been in collaboration with the Trump team as the president-elect continues the transition process to the White House. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner Key members of the incoming Trump administration are taking credit for the newly announced ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, arguing that the Jewish state and the Lebanese terrorist group agreed to the deal in response to US-President-elect Donald Trump’s election victory earlier this month. 'Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump,' US Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL), Trump’s incoming White House national security adviser, said on X/Twitter. 'His resounding victory sent a clear message to the rest of the world that chaos won’t be tolerated. I’m glad to see concrete steps towards deescalation in the Middle East.' While celebrating the ceasefire, Waltz also warned that Iran, which backs Hezbollah, remains the main obstacle in securing long-standing peace in the Middle East. 'But let’s be clear: The Iran Regime is the root cause of the chaos & terror that has been unleashed across the region. We will not tolerate the status quo of their support for terrorism,' Waltz added. Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal on Tuesday that took effect on Wednesday, effectively ending a 14-month period of war between the two parties. The agreement, brokered by the US and France, will allow roughly 70,000 Israelis to return to their homes in the northern portion of the Jewish state after having been displaced by barrages of missiles, rockets, and drones from Hezbollah. Estimates suggest that Hezbollah fired between 100-200 missiles into northern Israel nearly every day since the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel last Oct. 7. The ceasefire agreement will allow for intensified diplomatic efforts in Gaza, where Israel has been embroiled in an ongoing war with Hamas since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks. Addressing the press from the White House Rose Garden, Biden touted the new pact between Israel and Hezbollah. However, the president cautioned that Israel retains the right to retaliate should the terrorist group launch another attack against the Jewish state. 'Let’s be clear. Israel did not launch this war. The Lebanese people did not seek that war either. Nor did the United States,' Biden said. 'This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,' Biden added. 'What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed to threaten the security of Israel again.' The Biden administration had reportedly been in collaboration with the Trump team as the president-elect continues the transition process to the White House. Waltz and Jake Sullivan, the outgoing national security adviser, had reportedly been in communication regarding the White House’s efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. However, the Biden administration has said that none of Trump;s senior foreign policy team directly participated in the ceasefire negotiations. US Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) also credited Trump for the truce. 'I appreciate the hard work of the Biden administration, supported by President Trump, to make this ceasefire a reality,' Graham wrote on social media. Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank, posted on social media that 'Iran is pulling back to regroup ahead of Trump coming into office.' 'It’s a combination of Israeli military success and Trump’s election — the ayatollah has no clothes and he knows we know,' Goldberg said.

Gaza resettlement the answer to Oct. 7 massacre, ICC case, Israel...	Some 53% of Jewish Israelis support the reestablishment of Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip, according to the 'Peace Index' survey. By JNS Resettling the Israeli towns that were destroyed as part of the 2005 disengagement from Gaza is the answer to the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas massacre and the ICC case against the Jewish state’s leaders, Israeli Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf said on Thursday. Writing on X after a visit to the Gaza border with Zionist activist Daniella Weiss, Goldknopf—the head of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism Party—said that 'Jewish settlement here is the answer to the terrible [Oct. 7] massacre and to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.' The haredi leader noted that the ICC, 'instead of caring for the 101 captives [still held by Hamas after 419 days], chose to issue arrest warrants against the prime minister and the [former] defense minister.' In the post, Goldknopf shared a picture of himself and Weiss with a map of prospective Jewish communities to be established in the Gaza Strip. סיירתי היום בישובי חבל עזה. ההתיישבות היהודית כאן היא התשובה לטבח הנורא והתשובה לביה״ד הבינלאומי בהאג שבמקום לדאוג ל-101 החטופים בחר להוציא צווים נגד ראש הממשלה ושר הבטחון. pic.twitter.com/01GGVwcS1d &mdash; השר יצחק גולדקנופף (@DOVRUTGoldknopf) November 28, 2024 On Nov. 13, Weiss entered the enclave to scout potential locations for Jewish communities on behalf of her Nahala Movement, which works to establish new communities throughout the Land of Israel. Weiss, known for her leadership in the Gush Emunim movement, has been actively promoting a plan for resettling the Strip. Her organization has prepared six settlement nuclei involving hundreds of families. She told Kan News last week, 'We are no longer waiting for authorization. The moment entry is possible, we enter. We don’t wait for water supply infrastructure, generators or any other preparations. If 300 people enter at once, evacuating them would require 1,000 soldiers.' In August, Israeli security forces arrested six youths after dozens tried to breach the border to conduct a Jewish morning prayer service in Gaza. The attempt to enter the enclave came as resettlement activists marked 19 years since the military carried out the disengagement from Gaza, in which more than 8,000 Jews were forcibly removed from their homes in the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria. In August 2005, the Israeli government headed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon unilaterally disengaged from Gaza, removing thousands from their homes and transferring them to within the Green Line. While the move was designed to bring calm to Israel’s southern border, it ushered in a victory for Hamas in January 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council elections. In June 2006, the terrorist organization seized power in the Strip and evicted the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. During its Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of the northwestern Negev, Hamas murdered some 1,200 people and wounded thousands more. It also took around 250 civilians and soldiers back to Gaza as hostages. Some 53% of Jewish Israelis support the reestablishment of Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip, according to the 'Peace Index' survey released by Tel Aviv University in January of this year. Five months ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out the possibility of civilians returning to the enclave. 'If you mean resettling Gaza, … it was never in the cards, and I said so openly. And some of my constituents are not happy about it, but that’s my position,' the Israeli leader said in a May 21 interview with CNN.

Former hostage Mia Schem is engaged one year after her release	Mia Schem was one of 117 hostages who were released in November 2023 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, coinciding with a week-long pause in fighting. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Thursday, former hostage Mia Schem is engaged to be married to Yinon Hason just one year after she was released from captivity. Mia Schem was one of 117 hostages who were released in November 2023 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, coinciding with a week-long pause in fighting. Terrorists abducted her from the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, 2023. Mia Schem was shot in the arm while trying to flee Hamas terrorists on October 7th after seeing that they set her car on fire. 'It was a split-second decision, whether to stay put and burn to death or go with him,' she said. Mia was thrown onto the back of a pickup truck and was given a makeshift splint. In Gaza, a veterinarian operated on her arm with no anesthetic and told her that she was going to die a hostage. Schem described Gaza civilians she encountered in captivity as 'terrorists' who abetted in her abuse. 'I went through a Holocaust,' Schem said. 'Everyone over there is a terrorist.' 'It was important for me to reflect on the true situation of the people living in Gaza – who they are, and what I went through there.' 'These are families under Hamas. In retrospect, I suddenly realized that I was with a family. Suddenly, I started asking myself why I was in a family’s house? Why are there children here? Why is there a woman here?' Regarding the terrorist guarding her Mia Schem said, 'His wife was outside the room with the children,' she said. 'That was the only reason he didn’t rape me.' The dual French and Israeli citizen described being starved and bullied by the terrorist’s family as the guard didn’t take his eyes off of her as she sat in a darkened room. Mia Schem described the ordeal, 'I (was) closed in a dark room, not allowed to talk, not allowed to be seen, to be heard, hidden.' She added, 'There is a terrorist looking at you 24/7, looking.' Mia Schem told of her fear of being raped and burst into tears. 'There is fear of being raped, there is fear of dying.' She continued, 'His wife hated the fact that he and I were in the same room. You feel like you want a hug, you know, woman to woman, to break down a bit.' 'That’s all you had there. But she was so mean, she had such mean eyes.'

Housing Minister Goldknopf inspects proposed Israeli settlements ...	In 2005, 9000 Israelis were evacuated from 25 settlements in Gaza, and since then, many Israelis have advocated for a renewing a Jewish presence in the region. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Housing and Construction Minister Yitzchak Goldknopf said that he inspected the sites of proposed future Israeli settlements in Gaza. On X, Goldknopf posted a picture of himself with Daniella Weiss, the head of the Nachala Settlement Movement, holding up a map of plans for settlements in Gaza. The minister has advocated Israelis establishing homes once again in the Gaza Strip. In 2005, 9000 Israelis were evacuated from 25 settlements in Gaza, and since then, many Israelis have advocated for a renewing a Jewish presence in the region. In his tweet, Goldknopf wrote, 'Today, I toured the Gaza Strip settlements. Jewish settlement here is the response to the horrific massacre and a response to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which, instead of focusing on the 101 hostages, chose to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense.' Goldknopf did not enter Gaza but inspected the territory through binoculars. In another post on X, Nachala thanked Minister Goldknopf for his willingness to 'tour and observe the future settlement locations in Gaza.' The post continued, 'Together, we will build Jewish cities in Gaza, which will help lower apartment prices across the country, with the understanding that without settlement, there is no security. Gaza is ours, forever.' According to Hebrew media, some IDF soldiers, without permission from their superiors, let Weiss in to investigate sites for future Israeli settlements in Gaza. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that Israel should re-occupy Gaza and 'encourage' the Arabs living there to relocate. At a conference in August, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that if there had still been Jewish settlements in Gaza, the October 7 terror attack would never have happened. At the 10th Katif Conference for National Responsibility held Monday, Smotrich said, 'If there had been Jewish settlement in Gush Katif, the [October 7] massacre would not have happened.' He added that Israel's disengagement from Gaza turned Hamas into a 'terror monster.'

Would-be Trump assassin Ryan Routh echoes Democratic rhetoric, ca...	The 58-year-old has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial at a federal detention center in Miami. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Ryan Routh, the second person to attempt to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump, sent Politico a letter from jail that echoes Democratic rhetoric and calls Trump a 'dictator.' In the four-page letter, written before the presidential election, Routh warned that if Trump were to win, the United States needed to 'remove the power of our military by the President and place it with Congress before January.' 'We must limit all Presidential power before Trump seizes our country,' Routh wrote. Routh attempted to assassinate Trump at the then-candidate's West Palm Beach, Fla., golf course in September but fled the scene without firing his weapon after the Secret Service spotted him. The 58-year-old has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial at a federal detention center in Miami. Trump blamed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for inspiring Routh's attempt, citing Biden's and Harris's campaign-trail claims that he is a 'threat to democracy.' '[Routh] believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,' Trump said. 'Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country—both from the inside and out.' Routh praised himself and previous would-be assassin Thomas Crooks as 'ready to die for freedom and democracy.' Crooks tried to assassinate Trump during a July rally in Butler, Pa., striking Trump in the left ear, killing one attendee, and injuring two others before being fatally shot by the Secret Service. Routh sent a similar letter to the Palm Beach Post before the election that also referred to Trump as a 'dictator.' 'Palm Beach should be leading the way and guiding our country hopefully to choose democracy over a dictator,' that letter reads.

Ethiopian Israelis celebrate Sigd with prayers for unity and heal...	Sigd comes from the Aramaic word sged which means to prostrate oneself, as in prayer. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Ethiopian community gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the holiday of Sigd with a prayer gathering at the Western Wall and other events around the capital. Celebrated in Ethiopia for centuries, the holiday symbolizes the community’s longing for Jerusalem and connection to their Jewish heritage. It is now recognized as an official holiday in Israel and takes place 50 days after Yom Kippur. 'The prayer today at the Western Wall was a special and more meaningful prayer because it also dealt with the needs of the hour for the success of the Israeli government, the security forces, the return of the abductees and the physical and mental healing of the wounded,' said Deputy Speaker of the Knesset MK Moshe Solomon, who was born in in Ethiopia’s Tigray region. The holiday is marked with prayers, fasting, and public readings of the Torah on mountaintops, signifying the community’s aspirations to return to Zion. Since their mass immigration to Israel, Ethiopian Jews have continued this practice, often gathering in Jerusalem to mark the day. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Israel’s Ethiopian community stands at 171,600, of whom 54% were born in Ethiopia as of 2023. This includes 1,812 Ethiopian Jews who immigrated that year. Higher education enrollment is steadily increasing, with 4,144 Ethiopian students attending universities and colleges in the 2023/24 academic year, a 29.7% rise since 2016. This progress outpaces the general student population’s growth in higher education during the same period. Sigd comes from the Aramaic word sged which means to prostrate oneself, as in prayer.

Hezbollah believed to have lost as many as 4,000 fighters	According to World Bank estimates, Lebanon suffered $8.5 billion in damages and economic losses during the war—$3.4 billion in physical infrastructure damage and $5.1 billion in economic losses. By Joshua Marks, JNS In the past 14 months, the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah is believed to have suffered as many as 10 times the casualties as it did during the month-long 2006 Second Lebanon War. According to an assessment by Israel’s Channel 12 News and Institute for National Security Studies, the Israeli military believes that approximately 3,000 terrorists were killed in Lebanon, including at least 11 brigade-level commanders, 37 battalion commanders and 46 company commanders. Lebanon’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants, reports 3,823 killed and 15,895 injured during the conflict. A source familiar with Hezbollah’s operations told Reuters on Thursday that as many as 4,000 terrorists may have been killed, the vast majority of them since September, when Jerusalem stepped up its offensive in Lebanon after adding the return of tens of thousands of displaced residents to their homes in the north to its official war goals. The figure is over 10 times the number of Hezbollah members killed during the 2006 war. Hezbollah’s chain of command was also decimated, as highlighted by the Sept. 27 assassination of Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Other high-ranking officials killed include Hashem Safi al-Din, Nasrallah’s successor; Radwan Force commanders Ibrahim Aqil and Wisam al-Tuwail; Ali Karaki, commander of the Southern Front; and Fuad Shukr, the terror group’s chief of staff. Furthermore, some 80% of Hezbollah’s stockpile of 150,000 to 200,000 rockets and 70% of its drone arsenal were destroyed during the war, according to the Channel 12/INSS assessment. Hezbollah launched some 16,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel since joining the war in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the Gaza-based terror organization’s massacre in southern Israel. Nearly 70,000 residents of northern Israel have been internally displaced due to the cross-border attacks from Lebanon. During 'Operation Northern Arrows,' the Israeli military’s name for the northern war, 45 Israeli civilians and 79 IDF soldiers were killed, according to the most recent data from the Alma Research and Education Center, which monitors the northern fronts. Israeli authorities estimate property damage to exceed $273 million, according to Reuters, while Channel 12 and INSS reported that according to World Bank estimates, Lebanon suffered $8.5 billion in damages and economic losses during the war—$3.4 billion in physical infrastructure damage and $5.1 billion economic losses. An analysis of satellite data by The Washington Post in early November revealed that nearly a quarter of all buildings in 25 Lebanese towns and villages near the Israeli border were damaged or destroyed. At least 5,868 buildings were affected, with almost half located in the heavily impacted areas of Aita al-Shaab and Kafr Kila. Approximately 80% of the damage occurred after Oct. 2, 2024, coinciding with Israel’s ground offensive. The war displaced 1.2 million people in Lebanon, primarily from Southern Lebanon and the Dahieh district south of Beirut. Many sought refuge in Christian strongholds like Beirut and Mount Lebanon.

Israeli wheelchair dancing duo wins first place in European champ...	A Ness Ziona native, Margalit, 29, has been in a wheelchair since the age of 14 after suffering from the disease transverse myelitis. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Israeli wheelchair dancer Tomer Margalit and her dance partner Orel Chalaf won first place at the Para Dance Sport European Championship held in Prague on Friday with a combination freestyle routine that was set to Eden Golan‘s Eurovision song 'October Rain.' The dancing duo also dedicated their routine to the hostages still held captive by Hamas terrorists since being abducted on Oct. 7, 2023, during their deadly rampage across southern Israel. The dancers performed parts of their routine while blindfolded and tried to resemble the victims of the Oct. 7 attack by wearing garments that were torn, dirty, or appeared to be blood-stained. A Ness Ziona native, Margalit, 29, has been in a wheelchair since the age of 14 after suffering from the disease transverse myelitis. Chalaf, 21, is a professional Latin dancer, according to Ynet. The two dancers said that many of their competitors in the Para Dance Sport European Championship, as well as others involved in the competition, asked them to explain their dance, costumes and the significance of the song, according to the Israel Paralympic Committee. They welcomed the opportunity to draw awareness to the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre, including the remaining hostages. Margalit and Chalaf said they hope that by the next Para Dance World Championship, the hostages will be back home and there will be no longer a need to call for their return. 'October Rain' has lyrics that directly reference the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack in Israel. The song was initially written for Golan to perform at this year’s Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden. However, it was rejected by the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the contest, for being too political. Golan instead competed in the Eurovision with a reworded version of the song, titled 'Hurricane,' and finished in fifth place in the international competition. The 2024 Para Dance Sport European Championship took place from Nov. 22-24. Margalit shared in an Instagram post that she won first place a total of three times in the competition this year, including in solo dances.

EU warns member states against ‘undermining’ ICC arrest warrants,...	EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell defends International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister and ex-defense minister, warns EU member states not to ignore or 'undermine' the decision by refusing to arrest Netanyahu. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff The 27 member states of the European Union must strictly adhere to last week's decision by the International Criminal Court at The Hague to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the EU's top diplomat said Thursday. Speaking with reporters in Brussels on Thursday, Josep Borrell, the outgoing High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, warned European leaders not to ignore or 'undermine' the ICC arrest warrants, and defended the court's decision last Thursday to arrest the senior Israeli leaders. 'We cannot undermine the International Criminal Court,' Borrell said. 'It is the only way of having global justice. It is the only way to implement accountability.' 'If the Europeans do not support fully the International Court, without procrastination, then the International Criminal Court will not work.' The court's decision against Netanyahu and Gallant, Borrell argued, was 'not political.' The court 'is a legal body formed by respected people who are the best among the profession of judges.' Borrell rejected accusations of antisemitism in the decision against the Israeli leaders, citing the involvement of some Holocaust survivors in advising the ICC. 'Survivors of the Shoah has been among the people who were advising the International Criminal Court. So, the accusation of antisemitism is once again a failure word.' Speaking just days before the end of his term as the EU's foreign affairs chief, Borrell made scathing criticisms not only of Israel's handling of the war against Hamas, but also Israeli society as a whole, claiming extremist elements have created a 'different Israel.' 'Israeli society is being colonised from the inside by extremism and violent people. The colonists are not only expanding on the Israeli territory.

IDF carries out drone strike, opens fire on terrorists after Leba...	Suspects approach IDF positions in southern Lebanon, violating ceasefire for the third time in 24 hours, prompting Israeli soldiers to open fire. By World Israel News Staff Israeli soldiers deployed to southern Lebanon opened fire Thursday on suspects who approached villages in the area under IDF control, the Israeli military announced. The movement by the suspected terrorists, including some approaching in vehicles, towards Israeli positions marked yet another breach of the ceasefire which went into effect at 4:00 a.m. Wednesday morning. Hezbollah terrorists violated the ceasefire at least twice on Wednesday, including an incident at 9:07 a.m. during which operatives from the Iran-backed group approached an IDF position in Kfarkela, opposite the Israeli town of Metulla. At 12:08 p.m. that day, Hezbollah terrorists were spotted approaching the Israel-Lebanon border, prompting IDF soldiers to open fire. Israeli forces carried out a drone strike near a vehicle Thursday morning in the southern Lebanese town of Markaba, Galei Tzahal reported Thursday, leaving three injured. According to two Lebanese security officials who spoke with Reuters, Israeli tanks also fired several rounds at a terrorist position in Markaba. One of the two officials claimed that two people were injured by the tank fire, claim Lebanese state media appeared to corroborate. The pro-Hezbollah Al Mayadeen newspaper accused Israel of violating the ceasefire in Markaba. Under the terms of the ceasefire, which was adopted Tuesday by the Israeli security cabinet, Israel and Lebanon both retain the right to self-defense. A letter given to the Israeli government by the Biden administration recognizes Israel's right to act against terrorist threats in southern Lebanon without limit, while the IDF must defer to the Lebanese military outside of southern Lebanon and is only allowed to take action if the Lebanese army is shown to be unwilling or unable to remove the threat.

‘Colossal Failure’ – Mayor of northern Israeli town says Lebanon ...	Margaliot’s Eitan Davidi said that there was no victory in Lebanon because Israel’s residents will not be safe and they should not return home. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The head of a moshav along the border with Lebanon slammed the ceasefire deal with the Hezbollah terror group that went into effect Wednesday, in an interview Thursday with Radio 103FM. Eitan Davidi pulled no punches when noting the deal’s main weakness. 'We repeatedly requested that the distance between us and the villages where Hezbollah terrorists live in Lebanon be extended to two or three kilometers. Everyone, including the military, told us this proximity couldn’t continue.' It is 'a colossal failure' that the government 'didn’t deliver' on a buffer zone, he said, charging that this will 'lead us to a fourth Lebanon war and to the disintegration of the northern communities.' There is no exclusionary strip included in the agreement, but Israel has unofficially reserved the right – backed by the U.S. – to destroy any Hezbollah effort to reinstate its men or weaponry in southern Lebanon after the IDF pullout in 60 days’ time. An Israeli official told Reuters Wednesday that the IDF has leveled enough of Hezbollah’s infrastructure near the border that any attempt to re-enter the area would be seen and there would be enough time for Israel to respond. However, there is no clause in the deal stating that the Lebanese villages cannot be rebuilt, which would provide new hiding places for weapons and missile launchers, and the men to operate them. In its two-and-a-half month foray into Lebanon, IDF forces found that Iran’s chief proxy had built up a formidable armory in every village they entered and a tunnel network that reached the Israeli border in several places. Davidi does not believe that the government would follow through on its threats, due to past experience. 'I don’t trust the prime minister in anything he does—everything he touches fails,' he said. Although all top officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yisrael Katz, have warned that Israel will respond forcefully to every Hezbollah violation, he noted that 'for 18 years — 14 of them under Netanyahu — we bought time at an exorbitant cost' instead of acting against the terrorists. The government is 'ruining everything' in its failure to 'crush' Hezbollah 'more effectively,' and has given the terrorist group 'a second chance,' he said. None of the nearly 70,000 residents who were evacuated from Israel’s north last October for their own safety should return home, he said. 'Don’t go back,' he said. 'They’re sending us like sheep to the slaughter. Be careful. If the Radwan Force enters the North, the lucky ones will be killed outright.' The government has acknowledged that many residents will not be able to return for months yet, because their homes have been partially or completely destroyed due to Hezbollah’s rocket fire and need to be rebuilt, but said that people can return to other communities that are intact, or where the damage is much more limited.

Egyptian negotiators head to Israel with plans for limited Gaza c...	Egyptian delegation set to arrive in Israel Thursday, and will reportedly present proposal for a scaled-down hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire plan, lasting two months. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Egyptian government is slated to dispatch a delegation of intelligence officials to Israel Thursday, for consultations with Israel's negotiating team regarding efforts to reboot stalled hostage deal talks. During the meetings with their Israeli counterparts Thursday, the Egyptian delegation is expected to present an alternate plan, dubbed a 'comprehensive vision' for an agreement, according to sources who spoke with the pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar outlet. The alternate negotiating track would pursue a scaled-down deal initially, with a limited number of hostages to be released during a two-month ceasefire. Unlike the previous formula for talks, the new plan would not mandate a permanent end to the war, nor a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Israel would, during the initial ceasefire, be able to retain its positions in the coastal enclave, though it would be prohibited from undertaking any combat operations. A number of Israeli hostages would be released gradually over the course of the two-month ceasefire, with elderly and ill hostages being released first. 'There is optimism regarding reaching an agreement soon, due to American support,' Egyptian intelligence officials were quoted as saying. However, an Israeli source denied the report regarding the Egyptian delegation's impending arrival, telling Yedioth Aharanoth 'There is no such thing.' Thursday's report in Al-Akhbar adds that under the Egyptian plan, talks would be held during the two-month ceasefire for a permanent end to the war. Once the initial ceasefire goes into effect, Egypt will give Hamas several days to draft and hand over a comprehensive list of all living Israelis still held captive in the Gaza Strip. There are 101 captives remaining in the coastal enclave, though Israeli intelligence estimates that roughly half are likely dead.

China releases 3 Americans in prisoner exchange with Washington	The Biden administration traded the three American citizens for at least one unidentified Chinese citizen in U.S. custody. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon China released three Americans on Wednesday in a prisoner swap between Washington and Beijing, Politico reported. 'We are pleased to announce the release of Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and John Leung from detention in the People's Republic of China,' a National Security Council spokesman told Axios in a statement. The release of Swidan, Li, and Leung comes after years of comprehensive discussions between Biden administration officials and their Chinese counterparts. 'President Biden brought this up when he met with President Xi in Peru two weeks ago and Jake Sullivan brought this up when he was in Beijing [in September] and Secretary Blinken also pushed for this really hard in September at UNGA with [Chinese Foreign Minister] Wang Yi,' a senior administration official said. Swidan was imprisoned in 2012 on drug-related offenses, Li was detained in 2016 on espionage charges, and Leung was jailed in 2021, also on espionage charges.

Floyd Mayweather tells wounded Israeli soldiers at NYC Gala: ‘I’m...	The Belev Echad gala on Monday night raised $4.7 million for wounded IDF soldiers and it included a $100,000 donation from Mayweather. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Undefeated boxing champion Floyd Mayweather was the guest of honor on Monday night at an annual fundraising gala in New York City for wounded soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces. Mayweather accepted the 'Gloves of Healing' award at the gala for Belev Echad, an international initiative that helps wounded IDF veterans. During his acceptance speech on stage, the retired boxer talked about his unwavering support for the Jewish state since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. 'When I stood behind Israel, I wasn’t looking for an award — I felt I did what was right,' he explained. 'And when you choose your side, you stay on that side. And this is the side that I chose … and I will continue to stand behind this side right here.' Mayweather — who retired from professional boxing in 2017 with an undefeated record of 50 wins and no losses – has visited Israel several times since the deadly Hamas-led terrorist attack that took place across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. During his most recent trip to the country in October of this year, he visited wounded IDF soldiers, including some at the Belev Echad rehabilitation center in Kiryat Ono. 'I take my hat off to the soldiers,' Mayweather said on Monday night. 'Those warriors in Israel — I’m behind you guys, 100 percent. Since the war has started, I’ve been to Israel four, five times. And I will be back … It’s all about peace. I’m all about peace, love and happiness.' 'And I truly want the soldiers to continue to hold your heads up high, continue to smile, and continue to love another one,' he added. 'Because life is short and all we have is our loved ones. And that’s why love and your family is priceless … Let’s continue to fight and stand behind one another.' The Belev Echad gala on Monday night raised $4.7 million for wounded IDF soldiers and it included a $100,000 donation from Mayweather, according to Ynet. The legendary former boxer was one of the first outside of Israel to send supplies to the Jewish state after the Oct. 7 massacre last year. He used his private jet to deliver medical equipment, food, bulletproof vests for IDF soldiers, and other supplies needed in Israel. During his recent visit to Israel last month, Mayweather also met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who he described as 'an unbelievable gentleman' on Monday night. In early October, Mayweather pledged $100,000 to United Hatzalah of Israel to help the emergency medical service organization purchase 100 bulletproof vests to keep its volunteers safe.

AI-powered tool GluFormer offers early warning and tailored care ...	The model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 non-diabetic participants, ensuring it captures diverse patterns and generalizes well to different populations. By Pesach Benson, TPS A groundbreaking AI model developed in Israel is offering hope to millions of people managing diabetes or monitoring blood sugar levels by predicting glucose responses to foods, identifying early diabetes risks, and enabling tailored treatments. Developed by researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Tel Aviv-based startup Pheno.AI, and the US-based NVIDIA, the tool called GluFormer uses artificial intelligence to predict glucose levels and other health metrics based on past monitoring data, providing personalized insights into health management. Diabetes currently affects approximately 10% of adults worldwide, with numbers projected to double by 2050 to over 1.3 billion people. The disease is a leading cause of death globally and can result in severe complications such as kidney damage, vision loss, and heart problems. The economic burden of diabetes is expected to reach $2.5 trillion globally by 2030. GluFormer builds on the data from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), wearable devices that track blood sugar levels in real-time. CGM data has already been instrumental in diagnosing prediabetes and diabetes earlier, but GluFormer elevates this potential by forecasting health outcomes up to four years in advance, helping clinicians and patients detect irregularities and plan preventative care strategies. By incorporating dietary intake data, the AI tool can also predict how specific foods or diet changes will impact an individual’s glucose levels. This feature opens doors for precision nutrition, enabling users to make informed dietary choices tailored to their unique metabolic responses. 'Medical data, especially from CGMs, can be viewed as sequences of diagnostic tests that map biological processes over time,' explained Gal Chechik, senior director of AI research at NVIDIA. 'The transformer architecture, originally developed for analyzing long text sequences, can also predict the trajectory of medical diagnostics, revealing valuable insights into a patient’s health.' The novel technology behind GluFormer lies in its use of transformer model architecture, a cutting-edge neural network design originally developed for processing sequential data, such as text, in models like OpenAI’s GPT. This marks a significant leap in its application to healthcare, specifically for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and broader medical diagnostics. GluFormer was trained using CGM data collected every 15 minutes over 14 days. This granular, real-time data enhances the model’s ability to detect subtle trends and irregularities, making it more effective than conventional diagnostic tools. By incorporating dietary data into its analysis, the model can predict individual responses to specific foods, enabling tailored health advice. The model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 non-diabetic participants, ensuring it captures diverse patterns and generalizes well to different populations. The researchers also validated the model on 15 other datasets, demonstrating its ability to predict outcomes for people with various conditions, such as prediabetes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, obesity and gestational diabetes. In addition to glucose levels, GluFormer can forecast various other medical metrics. These include the apnea-hypopnea index, which is a measure of sleep apnea and is associated with type 2 diabetes. It can also forecast systolic blood pressure, which is linked to diabetes risk, and visceral adipose tissue (a marker for fat around organs). 'The convergence of generative AI technology and large-scale health data collection enabled us to extract valuable medical insights. It’s a significant step forward in leveraging AI for healthcare,' said lead researcher Guy Lutsker, a Nvidia researcher and Ph.D. student at the Weizmann Institute. Predicting individual glucose responses to specific foods will allow patients to make informed dietary choices to prevent spikes or crashes in blood sugar levels. For those at high risk of developing diabetes, the model can help identify early warning signs, enabling timely lifestyle adjustments or medical interventions. GluFormer also opens the door to tailored treatment plans and allow doctors to track how medical interventions impact a patient’s glucose levels over time.

Despite ceasefire, schools in northern Israel to remain shuttered	Keeping schools closed is a 'step of necessary caution,' says Defense Minister. By World Israel News Staff Schools in northern Israel are not scheduled to reopen in the near future, despite the recent implementation of a 60 day ceasefire between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group. Educational institutions near the Lebanese border have been shuttered for more than a year, as near-daily missile, rocket, and explosive drone attacks saw dozens of communities evacuated. But even as some displaced residents of the north return to their homes, local schools will not be open, and families with school-age children will need to find alternative educational solutions. As the war between Israel and Hezbollah escalated in late September, Israel's Home Front Command shuttered schools in the Golan Heights - where no communities were evacuated. In a statement, Defense Minister Israel Katz said schools in the Upper Galilee, along the northern border, and in the Golan Heights will not 'return to normalcy.' Referring to the decision as a 'step of necessary caution,' Katz said that keeping schools closed 'sends a clear message regarding Israel’s determination to enforce the [ceasefire] agreement.' Katz reiterated that if 'Hezbollah’s attempts to violate the agreement continue and the Lebanese government does not fulfill its obligations, Israel is prepared to respond strongly.' Katz added that 'we will not give up and we will not compromise on the safety of the residents of the north.' Notably, Katz's decision came after IDF and Home Front Command officials recommended that schools be reopened. Some parents were upset by the decision, after IDF officials gave them the impression that reopening schools was a certainty. 'We share your frustration regarding the change of policy, especially at the last minute. The defense establishment places our safety and the safety of our children as its top priority, and we are sure that such a difficult decision has justified considerations even if they are not visible to us,' said the Southern Golan Regional Council in a statement to parents.

‘Let’s get the hostages’ – Biden presses Netanyahu to cut deal wi...	After securing ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, President Biden reportedly pushes Netanyahu to reach an agreement with Hamas for hostages' release and Gaza truce. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week to compromise with the Hamas terror organization in order to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, Axios reported Wednesday. According to the report, Biden called Netanyahu on Tuesday, after American brokers managed to secure a truce between Israel, Lebanon, and Hezbollah that day, which went into effect Wednesday morning. The report cited two American officials, who said the call came shortly after the Israeli security cabinet voted to approve the ceasefire deal with Hezbollah. The two sources said the call was brief, lasting only a few minutes, and that the call focused on the Lebanon ceasefire, and Biden's push to use the momentum from the deal to secure a similar agreement between Israel and Hamas. 'We have an opportunity now. Let's get the hostages,' Biden was quoted as telling Netanyahu during the call. The report claimed that Netanyahu responded 'positively' and said he wanted to try to secure a deal. One Biden aide said the president is intent on securing a hostage deal before he leaves office in January. 'Biden thinks that doing nothing and telling the hostage families to wait until Jan. 20 would be crazy,' the aide said. Israeli and U.S. officials cited in the report said the Lebanon ceasefire makes a deal with Hamas more likely, even if only the first phase of a planned three-phase deal is actually implemented. According to a senior Israeli minister, the Israeli premier is pushing for a scaled-down hostage deal, under which Israel would not commit to a permanent end to the war or a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. 'There is an intention to make a renewed effort to get a deal in Gaza. It was clear that the war in Lebanon had to end first. Now Hamas is in a weaker position because Hezbollah is out of the war,' the minister told Axios.

12-year-old discovers 3,500-year-old relic in central Israel	12-year-old girl finds ancient Egyptian amulet during a family trip in central Israel. By World Israel News Staff Dafna Filshteiner, age 12, was recently hiking below the ancient site of Tel Qana in Hod Hasharon, when suddenly, to her surprise, she discovered an unusual find a beetle-like stone used as an Egyptian amulet about 3,500 years ago. 'I was looking down at the ground to find porcupine needles and smooth pebbles,' Filshteiner said. 'And suddenly I picked up an interesting stone. I showed it to my mother, and she said it was just an ordinary stone or a bead. But then I saw a decoration and stubbornly insisted it was more than that, so we searched on the Internet.' 'There, we identified more photos of stones similar to what we had found. We realized that it was something special and immediately called the Antiquities Authority.' The family turned to Mor Wiesel, an archaeologist at the Israel Antiquities Authority, who thanked Dafna and her family, awarded them a certificate of excellence for good citizenship, and transferred the scarab to the state archives housed in the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel. The find was examined by Dr. Yitzhak Paz, Bronze Age expert at the Israel Antiquities Authority. The item was found to date back to the New Kingdom period in Egypt, about 3,500 years ago. Two scorpions appear on it, standing head to tail. 'The scorpion symbol represented the Egyptian goddess Serket, who was considered responsible, among other things, for protecting pregnant mothers,' Dr. Paz said. 'Another decoration on the amulet is the nefer symbol, which in Egyptian means ‘good’ or ‘chosen’. There is also another symbol which looks like a royal staff.' The scarab is an amulet designed in the shape of a dung beetle. This beetle, considered sacred in the eyes of the ancient Egyptians, was a symbol of new life, because it would create a dung ball, lay its eggs in it, from which new life then hatched. The Egyptian name derives from the verb 'to form,' or 'to be created', as the Egyptians saw the scarab as symbolizing the embodiment of the divine creator. The scarab amulets found in Israel––sometimes used as a seal––are evidence of Egyptian rule in our region about 3,500 years ago, and its cultural influence on this region. 'The scarab is indeed a distinct Egyptian characteristic, but their wide distribution also reached far beyond Egypt’s borders,' Paz added. 'It may have been dropped by an important and authoritative figure passing through the area, or it may have been deliberately buried. Since the find was discovered on the surface, it is difficult to know its exact context.' Tel Qana, which stands near the findspot of the scarab, is an archaeological site of great historical importance. 'This find is both exciting and significant,' said Dr. Amit Dagan of Bar-Ilan University and Dr. Ayelet Dayan from the Israel Antiquities Authority, who are conducting excavations at the site. 'The scarab and its unique pictorial features, along with other finds discovered at Tel Qana with similar motifs, provide new insights into the nature of the Egyptian influence in the region in general, and the Yarkon area in particular.'

Israel to appeal ‘illegitimate, absurd’ ICC warrants	Biased' ICC warrants lack 'any factual or legal basis,' Jerusalem says in statement. By World Israel News Staff Israel will formally appeal the ICC warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, adding that Jerusalem will partner with Washington to take punitive measures against the Hague. 'The State of Israel rejects the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, and the legitimacy of the arrest warrants that were issued,' read a statement from the Prime Minister's Office. 'Israel’s appeal notice exposes in detail just how absurd the issuance of arrest warrants was and how it lacks any factual or legal basis.' Addressing the charges levied against Netanyahu and Gallant, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, the statement denied those allegations and stressed that Israel is not a member state of the ICC. The statement warned that should the ICC move forward with the warrants, such a move would 'underline to Israel’s friends in the U.S. and the world how biased the International Criminal Court is against Israel.' Netanyahu's office added that the premier is contact with senior Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Israel supporter. Graham, Netanyahu's office said, had updated the prime minister regarding 'the efforts that he is advancing in the US Congress against the ICC and countries that have co-operated with it'. Last week, President Joe Biden called the ICC warrants 'outrageous.' Noting that an arrest warrant was also issued against slain Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, Biden added that 'whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.' When the ICC decision was made public last week, Netanyahu called the warrants 'an antisemitic step that has one goal - to deter me, to deter us from having our natural right to defend ourselves against enemies who try to destroy us.' American attorney Alan Dershowitz recently said he is assembling a 'legal dream team' to defend Israel in the Hague.

IDF thwarted Hezbollah’s efforts to produce chemical weapons – re...	The source said that Hezbollah's Radwan force were planning to use the weapons against civilians in Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An unsourced report on Channel 12 indicates the IDF thwarted an attempt by Hezbollah to produce chemical weapons they intended to use in an invasion of northern Israel. The report did not indicate precisely where the weapons were found. The source said that Hezbollah's Radwan force were planning to use the weapons against civilians in Israel. Hezbollah was reportedly at the early stages of the development of chemical weapons, and Israel's intelligence and military are monitoring the threat. An earlier report by Makor Rishon said Israeli troops discovered gas tanks, coveralls, and gas masks. The report is derived from interviews with Israeli soldiers, although the IDF has denied the report. In the first 12 hours of the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon, Hezbollah has already violated the agreement twice with a swift response from the IDF. From the implementation of the truce, which was set to begin at 4:00 am on Wednesday morning, Hezbollah twice approached areas that were barred from them according to the agreement. The ceasefire proposal requires Hezbollah to retreat to the area behind the Litani River. The first violation occurred at 9:07 am when Hezbollah terrorists approached Kfarkela, which overlooks Metula. David Azoulay, the leader of the Metula Council, addressed the ceasefire violation, stating, 'Just a few minutes ago, eight vehicles and a motorcycle belonging to Hezbollah arrived at the ruins in Kfarkela. The IDF fired a warning shot to push them back. Nothing has changed since October 7.' The IDF confirmed: 'By the directive from the political echelon, the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon took effect at 04:00 today (Wednesday), and the IDF has been acting accordingly.' 'Over the past hour, the IDF detected a vehicle with several suspects in a restricted zone in Lebanese territory. IDF troops fired to prevent their movement, and the suspects subsequently left the area.' 'There have been no changes to the guidelines issued by the Home Front Command.' The second violation of the ceasefire took place at 12:08 when the IDF fired warning shots when Hezbollah suspects approached the Western section of the Israel-Lebanon border. The IDF confirmed: 'In the past few hours, the IDF detected suspects in southern Lebanon and fired at them.'

Hezbollah violates ceasefire twice in first 12 hours	The IDF remains deployed in southern Lebanon and will take action against any violation of the ceasefire agreement.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In the first 12 hours of the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon, Hezbollah has already violated the agreement twice with a swift response from the IDF.

The IDF confirmed: 'In the past few hours, the IDF detected suspects in southern Lebanon and fired at them.' 'The IDF remains deployed in southern Lebanon and will take action against any violation of the ceasefire agreement.' In response, the IDF struck a covert Hezbollah weapons factory and caused significant damage.

Hezbollah violates ceasefire agreement just twice in just 12 hour...	The IDF remains deployed in southern Lebanon and will take action against any violation of the ceasefire agreement.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In the first 12 hours of the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon, Hezbollah has already violated the agreement twice with a swift response from the IDF. From the implementation of the truce, which was set to begin at 4:00 a.m. on Wednesday morning, Hezbollah twice approached areas that were barred from them according to the agreement. The ceasefire proposal requires Hezbollah to retreat to the area behind the Litani River. The first violation occurred at 9:07 am when Hezbollah terrorists approached Kfarkela, which overlooks Metula. David Azoulay, the leader of the Metula Council, addressed the ceasefire violation, stating, 'Just a few minutes ago, eight vehicles and a motorcycle belonging to Hezbollah arrived at the ruins in Kfarkela. The IDF fired a warning shot to push them back. Nothing has changed since October 7.' The IDF confirmed: 'By the directive from the political echelon, the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon took effect at 04:00 today (Wednesday), and the IDF has been acting accordingly.' 'Over the past hour, the IDF detected a vehicle with several suspects in a restricted zone in Lebanese territory. IDF troops fired to prevent their movement, and the suspects subsequently left the area.' 'There have been no changes to the guidelines issued by the Home Front Command.' The second violation of the ceasefire took place at 12:08 when the IDF fired warning shots when Hezbollah suspects approached the Western section of the Israel-Lebanon border. The IDF confirmed: 'In the past few hours, the IDF detected suspects in southern Lebanon and fired at them.' 'The IDF remains deployed in southern Lebanon and will take action against any violation of the ceasefire agreement.' In response, the IDF struck a covert Hezbollah weapons factory and caused significant damage. In a speech announcing the ceasefire agreement on Tuesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said, 'Netanyahu said 'If Hezbollah doesn't follow the agreement, we'll attack. If it's going to try to build up terrorist structures or a truck with missiles, we'll attack'. He said the IDF made 'enormous achievements on seven fronts' and 'set Hezbollah back decades.'

Adolf Eichmann’s executioner dies at 86	He was also present when Eichmann’s body was cremated in a specially built oven. By Pesach Benson, TPS Shalom Nagar, a former Prison Services officer who hung Adolf Eichmann, died at the age of 86. Born in Yemen, he was orphaned of his father and abandoned by his mother. Nagar he made his way to Israel at the age of 14. After completing his military service as a paratrooper, Nagar joined the prison service. Adolf Eichmann, the chief architect of the Nazi Germany’s Final Solution, was captured in Buenos Aires by the Mossad and spirited back to Israel for trial in 1960. Because most of the Prison Service guards were either concentration camp survivors or had lost family in the Holocaust, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion specifically ordered that Eichmann be guarded by Sephardic Jews — who trace their ancestry to the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain. Nagar and 21 other handpicked guards stayed with Eichmann for six months at the Ramla Prison in central Israel. They watched Eichmann in shifts to prevent him from committing suicide and tasted his food in case it was poisoned. Following an eight-month trial in Jerusalem, Eichmann was convicted of crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes against the Jewish people, and membership in a criminal organization and sentenced to death by hanging. He was hung in the Ramla prison at midnight on May 31, 1962, the only individual ever executed by Israel. Nagar lottery selected to push the button that opened the trapdoor below the Eichmann’s gallows. He was also present when Eichmann’s body was cremated in a specially built oven. A Coast Guard boat scattered Eichmann’s ashes in the sea several kilometers off the coast of Jaffa. After retiring from the Prison Service, Nagar worked as a butcher and later was one of the founding families of Kiryat Arba, next to Hebron. Nagar adopted a religious lifestyle and spent his later years in a kollel, studying Torah and receiving a stipend. Nagar is survived by his children, 12 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

Iran treats Hezbollah terrorists while own citizens die in hospit...	The lavish medical support for Hezbollah terrorists has ignited fury among Iranian citizens, who face a deepening healthcare crisis marked by severe medicine shortages and an exodus of medical professionals. By Jewish Breaking News While Iranian civilians struggle to access basic healthcare, Tehran’s hospitals have become a haven for thousands of wounded Hezbollah terrorists. Iranian Health Minister Mohammadreza Zafarghandi revealed to student Basij leaders on Tuesday that nearly 500 Hezbollah terrorists received specialized treatment in Iranian facilities, requiring approximately 1,500 surgeries for devastating injuries sustained during Israel’s September strike on the terror group’s communication systems. According to Red Crescent chief Pirhossein Kolivand, Tehran deployed specialized medical teams to Lebanon, including eye specialists, while arranging hospital transfers for 95 severely wounded Hezbollah terrorists. A medical task force of 12 doctors plus support staff provided additional ground support. The lavish medical support for Hezbollah terrorists has ignited fury among Iranian citizens, who face a deepening healthcare crisis marked by severe medicine shortages and an exodus of medical professionals seeking better opportunities abroad. Human rights advocates point to the regime’s cruel double standard, noting its refusal to provide care to Iranian protesters who were deliberately blinded during the country’s 2022 civil unrest crackdown. In a recent Knesset speech, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disclosed that Israel moved up its preplanned targeted attack against Hezbollah, which blinded and injured thousands of Hezbollah operatives, due to fears of exposure. 'From the moment I learned that this was about to be revealed, I decided that it was necessary to act immediately,' Netanyahu said. 'There were those who argued that the US should be informed ahead of time. I argued that the US should not be informed because this could lead to either resistance or a leak, which is the same thing,' he stated. 'A leak would have immediately demonstrated the effectiveness of the move. I denied it outright and we acted.'

‘He’s not kidding’: Trump border czar Tom Homan prepares for depo...	Democrats, those close to Homan said, need to weigh whether any political stunts are worth the severe criminal penalties. By Joseph Simonson, The Washington Free Beacon As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to fulfill his pledge to carry out the mass illegal immigrant deportations he promised, all eyes are on the man tasked with implementing that mission: incoming 'border czar' Thomas Homan, a more than 30-year law enforcement veteran who led Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the first Trump administration. Standing in Homan's way are a handful of Democratic governors and mayors who have vowed to fight deportations of illegal immigrants in their jurisdictions. The most notable case is Denver mayor Mike Johnston (D.), who said last week in an interview that he is willing to put police officers at the county line to repel ICE agents, comparing Trump’s immigration plans to the massacre at Tiananmen Square. 'More than us having DPD stationed at the county line to keep them out, you would have 50,000 Denverites there,' Johnston told Denverite. 'It's like the Tiananmen Square moment with the rose and the gun, right? You’d have every one of those Highland moms who came out for the migrants. And you do not want to mess with them.' While Johnston walked back those comments, he still said he's ready to go to jail for obstructing Trump's immigration actions he thinks are 'wrong.' 'Would I have taken it back if I could? Yes, I probably wouldn't have used that image,' Johnston told 9News. 'That's the image I hope we can avoid. What I was trying to say is this is an outcome I hope we can avoid in this country.' Johnston is one of many Democrats who have pledged to make it difficult for Trump and Homan to carry out mass deportations. Those close to Homan told the Washington Free Beacon that the Trump White House is prepared to use all tools at its disposal to force them to cooperate with—or at least not obstruct—its mass deportation agenda. Those tools include prosecutions under at least two provisions in the federal code. Federal law prohibits an individual from knowingly harboring any illegal aliens from law enforcement. It's also a felony to hinder any law enforcement investigation—a charge Homan is likely to call for should any local or state leader attempt to slow down deportations. Democrats, those close to Homan said, need to weigh whether any political stunts are worth the severe criminal penalties. Homan, who did not respond to a request for comment, said as much on Monday. In an interview with Fox News, he said, 'Me and the Denver mayor agree on one thing: He is willing to go to jail, and I am willing to put him there.' There is no doubt among those who worked with Homan that he intends to make good on his threat. One individual, who spoke anonymously but worked with Homan directly, said the next Trump administration is expected to work with the Justice Department and bring felony charges against those who actively block any ICE deportations. 'Homan talks about this almost every day,' said one individual who spoke on the condition of anonymity but worked closely under Homan during the first administration. 'He’s not kidding.' Blue states and cities, by law, do not have to cooperate with federal law enforcement. A local police department is not legally required to assist ICE or any other federal agency with deportations. But state and local officials cannot, for example, order police officers to block an ICE official from entering a building, as Johnston suggested earlier this month. Nor can they give false information to a federal law enforcement official. Denver’s mayor is not the only Democrat who has said he will fight Trump’s planned deportations. Six Democratic prosecutors spoke with Politico earlier this month and said they plan a rash of lawsuits. That may make some deportations more difficult. Homan is more than happy to face that problem, though those close to him believe that some police departments located in so-called sanctuary cities, municipalities with policies that block local law enforcement from cooperating with federal deportation orders, will relent. Trump’s attorney general nominee, Pam Bondi, is expected to work closely with Homan and others to force Democratic compliance. One factor that attracted Bondi to Trump, an individual familiar with the choice told the Free Beacon, was her hardline position against drug traffickers as Florida’s attorney general. The incoming Trump administration is itching for a fight with Democrats on deportations, said one individual familiar with their thinking. Polls taken after Trump’s decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris show that a majority of voters support a mass deportation program. 'Sanctuary policies are wildly unpopular, even among blue state voters, and these governors and mayors are siding with lawbreaking foreigners who have overstayed visas, ignored court orders, and committed horrific crimes,' said Jon Feere, who served as a senior adviser to the Department of Homeland Security during Trump’s first term. There are an estimated 12 million illegal aliens living in the United States, according to the Center for Migration Studies of New York, although some believe that figure is much higher. ew immigration experts believe all of those individuals can be deported within four years, regardless of whether Trump mobilizes the military. Homan has said that he plans to prioritize illegal aliens with criminal convictions or those who have already received a deportation order from an immigration court. Such a strategy could, one senior Republican adviser said, shield Trump from any political fallout. 'The first hundred thousand or so will be the easiest,' the individual said. 'Trump can just line them up and say, ‘There’s a rapist, there’s a thief, there’s a murderer.' Democrats don’t want to oppose that.'

IAF destroyed secret Hezbollah rocket factory ahead of ceasefire	The strike disabled Hezbollah’s capacity to produce mid-range rockets in Lebanon, according to the report. By JNS Shortly before the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect early Wednesday morning, Israeli jets dropped about 100 bombs on a top-secret factory for producing mid-range rockets, according to Hebrew media reports. The Israel Defense Forces had been aware of the facility in Janta, a city situated about 75 kilometers (46 miles) east of Beirut, for some time despite Hezbollah’s efforts to camouflage it, Channel 12 News reported on Wednesday. The strike disabled Hezbollah’s capacity to produce mid-range rockets in Lebanon, according to the report. Also on Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson’s Unit said that since the start of hostilities with Hezbollah on Oct 8., 2023, the Iranian proxy group has lost 70% of its unmanned aerial vehicles. 'Since the beginning of the war and within the framework of ‘Operation Northern Arrows’ in particular, fighter jets under the direction of the Intelligence Directorate and the air force launched an extensive effort to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure of Hezbollah’s Aerial Unit,' also known as Unit 127, according to the IDF. Some 200 targets were hit as part of this effort, including more than 150 drone launch sites and some 20 weapons depots and 30 headquarters used by the unit, according to the IDF. Four factories for drones and cruise missiles were also hit. 'With the help of these attacks, Hezbollah lost 70% of its stock of UAVs, and about 30 cruise missiles intended to harm Israeli citizens,' according to the statement. Moreover, the Aerial Unit’s chain of command has been 'eliminated' with the assassination of its operations officer, Jafar Ali Samaha, on Tuesday night in a targeted strike, the military said. The IDF eliminated the commander of Unit 127, Muhammad Hussein Sarour ('Abu Saleh'), in Beirut on Sept. 26. A month later it eliminated Khadr al-Abed Bahja, the officer responsible for the unit’s Northern Litani sector.

Israeli leaders in Judea and Samaria laying groundwork for sovere...	Israeli leaders hope that Trump will revisit the issue of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, aligning with his previous peace plans’ provisions for annexing Area C of Judea and Samaria. By Anna Epshtein, TPS Anticipating support from the incoming US administration of President-elect Donald Trump, leaders of Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria are laying the groundwork for the possible extension of Israeli sovereignty to parts of the territory. Briefing reporters on Wednesday, Israel Ganz, head of the Yesha Council, suggested that after achieving normalization with other Arab countries, discussions on sovereignty in Judea and Samaria could resume. The Yesha Council is an umbrella organization for all the communities in Judea and Samaria, representing the interests of around 500,000 Israelis. 'We anticipate more countries joining the normalization process with Israel,' Ganz said, without naming specific states. Israel and Saudi Arabia were moving closer to normalization before the diplomacy was disrupted by Hamas’s October 7 attack. Ganz expressed hope that Trump would revisit the issue of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, aligning with his previous peace plans’ provisions for annexing Area C of Judea and Samaria. The Oslo Accords divided Judea and Samaria into Areas A, B, and C. In Area A, the Palestinian Authority maintains administrative and security responsibility. In Area B, the Palestinian Authority has administrative jurisdiction, but Israel maintains responsibility for security. In Area C, where all of Judea and Samaria’s Jews live, Israel has administrative and security jurisdiction. Area C makes up 60 percent of the territory of Judea and Samaria. Ganz said he prefers the term 'sovereignty' over 'annexation,' clarifying, 'Annexation focuses on land ownership, while sovereignty is about responsibility.' The Yesha Council has begun preparatory work which Ganz described as mostly conceptual. 'We’re brainstorming, not drawing maps,' Ganz explained. 'Our focus is on technical readiness, such as water and electricity infrastructure, should a political decision be made.' Ganz predicted a potential timeline for action, suggesting that sovereignty measures could take place within 18 months. 'We have elections in Israel in two years and U.S. midterms approaching. This creates a window of opportunity to find a solution,' he said. Regarding the status of Palestinians living in Area C, Ganz said he supported giving them full Israeli citizenship. The number of Palestinians living in Areas C is not clear, but estimates range from 80,000-300,000. As for the status of an estimated more than 2 million Palestinians living in Areas A and B, Ganz proposed a model similar to the status of Palestinians living in eastern Jerusalem. Palestinians living in Jerusalem with temporary residence permits are entitled to vote in municipal elections and receive social benefits, but cannot vote in national elections or hold a mayoral office. Explaining his optimism, Ganz remarked, 'The last US administration was the worst, as for me, because they didn’t want to hear what we say. They never came here, although we tried hard to invite them. How can you come up with any solution when you only hear one side? I hope that the new administration will give us as a democratic state a chance to say what we want.'

Anti-Israel groups plan coordinated protests in ‘global escalatio...	A similar coalition in April coordinated a 'multi-city economic blockade' and for hours stopped traffic on major highways and thruways, including the Golden Gate Bridge. By Jessica Costescu, The Washington Free Beacon A coalition of radical anti-Israel groups is planning a 'global escalation' in dozens of cities across the United States throughout the Thanksgiving holiday season. The 'Global Escalation' coalition describes itself as 'a collective effort from people who share the understanding that we must urgently step up our actions to stop this genocide.' It directs activists to protest in their area and provides resources on how to organize and improve their security strategies. Some of the cities listed include New York, Chicago, Sacramento, Denver, and Charleston. 'We reject a world where genocide and war crimes go unpunished. In 3 days, for 3 days, withdraw from participating in the global economy to reject this new ‘normal,’' the coalition posted Sunday on Instagram. 'Disrupt any and all entities that allow or enable genocide. Disrupt the finances fuelling or profiting from genocide.' 'Join direct action and strikes around the world: refuse labour, stop spending, and hit the pockets of those fuelling or profiting from genocide,' the post continued. In Charleston, S.C., for instance, a participating anti-Israel group is planning to 'start [a] car caravan to interrupt business as usual through the central arteries' of the city. In Chicago, the local chapters of the Palestinian American Council, Students for Justice in Palestine, and American Muslims for Palestine will protest at a large shopping mall to 'reject capitalist ‘holidays.’' The coalition’s website boasts that it 'will bring together people and movements around the world to step up the collective resistance by going on strike, refusing to shop and by taking direct action. It will be the first of a series of blows that will force change.' 'By halting revenue over one of the most profitable times of the year, the people stand in solidarity with all communities harmed by the same colonial forces worldwide, rejecting the celebration of colonial legacies like ‘Thanksgiving Day’ on the 28th,' the site continues. 'The efforts will culminate on the 29th, coinciding with the Friday Day of Rage and the opening of the infamous ‘Black Friday’ season. Most importantly, November 29th marks the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.' Additional protests are also planned in Omaha, Boise, Malden, Mass., Ventura, San Pedro, and Williamstown, Mass. Others are expected in Canada, Australia, Japan, and throughout Europe. A similar coalition in April coordinated a 'multi-city economic blockade' and for hours stopped traffic on major highways and thruways, including the Golden Gate Bridge. Left-wing groups, including the Tides Center—a George Soros-funded dark money network—Community Justice Exchange, and National Students for Justice in Palestine were among the participating groups. In one instance, activists shut down access to Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, backing up traffic and forcing some travelers to walk with their luggage to the airport. Organizers advised activists to refrain from engaging with police and promised that Community Justice Exchange would provide 'money bail, court fees and fines' anThanksd other legal services upon arrest.

Italy rejects Netanyahu arrest as ‘unfeasible’	Rome expresses 'many doubts' about practical relevance of International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, says it is 'not feasible' to take him into custody so long as he remains in office. By World Israel News Staff The Italian government suggested Tuesday that the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is irrelevant, saying it is 'unfeasible' to arrest a sitting head of government. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani spoke at a press conference Tuesday during the Group of Seven (G7) conference hosted by Italy, telling reporters that his government had 'many doubts' regarding the viability of the ICC's arrest warrant for Prime Minister Netanyahu. 'Netanyahu would never go to a country where he can be arrested,' Tajani told reporters Tuesday, suggesting that practically speaking, the arrest warrant against Netanyahu cannot be implemented while he remains in office. 'The arrest of Netanyahu is unfeasible, at least as long as he is Prime Minister.' On Tuesday, the G7 countries, including Italy, the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France, Germany, and Japan, issued a joint statement on the situation in the Middle East, following the publication of the ICC arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. However, efforts to reach a common ground on the ICC arrest warrants failed, and the statement declined to directly address the issue, referencing the subject obliquely, calling on Israel to adhere to 'International Humanitarian Law,' while rejecting equivalency between Israel and Hamas. 'In exercising its right to defend itself, Israel must fully comply with its obligations under international law in all circumstances, including International Humanitarian Law,' the G7 members said. 'We reiterate our commitment to International Humanitarian Law and will comply with our respective obligations. We underline that there can be no equivalence between the terrorist group Hamas and the State of Israel.' The Italian government has also been sharply divided over the ICC arrest warrants, with Defense Minister Guido Crosetto of the conservative Brothers of Italy party indicating Italy would adhere to the ICC's instructions should Netanyahu visit the country; while Infrastructure and Transportation Minister Matteo Salvini of the populist Lega party reject calls to arrest the Israeli premier and instead invited him to visit Italy.

After Lebanon deal, Hamas ‘ready for ceasefire’	Hamas official says that in the wake of the truce between Israel and Hezbollah, and amid efforts by Turkey, Egypt, and Qatar to reboot talks, the terrorist group is 'ready' for a 'serious' deal with Israel. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization is 'ready' to engage in 'serious' talks with Israel aimed at reaching a hostage deal and lasting ceasefire, a member of the group said Wednesday. Speaking with AFP Wednesday morning after a truce went into effect in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, the Hamas official said his organization is now 'committed' to pursuing talks with Israel, brokered by Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar. 'We have informed mediators in Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey that Hamas is ready for a ceasefire agreement and a serious deal to exchange prisoners,' the Hamas spokesman said Wednesday, after a ceasefire negotiated by the U.S. and France went into effect between Israel and Hezbollah, a group which, like Hamas, is considered a proxy force of Iran. In a statement Wednesday morning, Hamas announced it is prepared to engage in 'any effort' necessary to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. 'We are committed to cooperating with any effort to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, and we are interested in ending the aggression against our people.' Later on Wednesday, Hamas' Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that the group 'appreciates' Hezbollah's right to reach an independent agreement with Israel, separate from a broader deal including the Gaza Strip. 'Hamas appreciates the right of Lebanon and Hezbollah to reach an agreement that protects the people of Lebanon and we hope that this agreement will pave the way to reaching an agreement that ends the war of genocide against our people in Gaza.' Abu Zuhri, however, claimed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was an obstacle to any deal. 'Hamas showed high flexibility to reach an agreement and it is still committed to that position and is interested in reaching an agreement that ends the war in Gaza.' 'The problem was always with Netanyahu who has always escaped from reaching an agreement.' While Hamas has blamed Israel for months for the failure to achieve a hostage deal, both Jerusalem and Washington have accused the Gaza terror group of rejecting any compromises in ceasefire talks. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden placed the onus on Hamas to achieve a breakthrough. 'Hamas has refused, for months and months, to negotiate a good-faith ceasefire and a hostage deal,' Biden said. 'And so, now Hamas has a choice to make. Their only way out is to release the hostages, including American citizens which they hold, and, in the process, bring an end to the fighting, which would make possible a surge of humanitarian relief.'

France declares Netanyahu cannot be arrested over ICC warrants	French foreign ministry releases statement emphasizing that it will not carry out the International Criminal Court's orders to arrest Israeli leaders including Prime Minister Netanyahu, noting that he enjoys immunity to ICC rulings. By World Israel News Staff France will not aid the International Criminal Court in The Hague to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the French foreign ministry announced Wednesday morning. In a press release issued by the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Paris noted that Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute which established the ICC, and therefore Israeli leaders are not subject to the court's decisions. While the French foreign ministry said Paris will 'respect' its obligations to the ICC, Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders enjoy immunity vis-a-vis the international court. 'France will respect its international obligations, on the understanding that the Rome Statute requires full cooperation with the International Criminal Court (ICC),' the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs said, 'and also provides that a State cannot be required to act in a manner inconsistent with its obligations under international law with respect to the immunities of States not party to the ICC.' 'Such immunities apply to Prime Minister Netanyahu and other relevant ministers and will need to be taken into consideration should the ICC request their arrest and surrender.' The French foreign ministry noted the 'historic friendship' between Paris and Jerusalem, vowing to work 'closely' with the Israeli premier. 'In accordance with the historic friendship that binds France to Israel, two democracies committed to the rule of law and respect for a professional and independent justice system, France intends to continue to work closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the other Israeli authorities to achieve peace and security for all in the Middle East.'

Israelis sharply divided over ceasefire with Hezbollah	Channel 12's survey showed that 20% even say Israel 'lost' in Lebanon, while a whopping 61% of Channel 13's respondents said Israel 'did not win.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Polls carried out by two Israeli television news channels Tuesday show that the public is sharply divided over the ceasefire deal with Hezbollah that came into effect Wednesday morning. Channel 13’s survey had 37% against the agreement, 44% for it, and nearly a fifth, 19%, answering that they didn’t know. Channel 12’s results were more evenly split, with only 37% thinking it was a good idea, 32% disagreeing, and a much larger minority, 31%, saying they were not sure. In pointed contrast to the top Israeli officials who declared that Israel could declare victory over the Iranian terror proxy that had launched upwards of 20,000 missiles, UAVs, rockets, RPGs and other deadly projectiles at the Jewish state over the past year, fully 61% of the respondents in the Channel 13 poll said Israel 'did not win.' A quarter, 26%, said Israel won, and 13% said they did not know. Channel 12’s group had a very different view, however, with 19% saying Israel 'lost.' The largest group, 50%, believed that the result of the entire military confrontation was inconclusive, while 20% saying the Jewish state lost, and the rest saying they did not know. Channel 12 broke down the respondents into Opposition and coalition supporters, and it revealed a perhaps troubling message to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security cabinet colleagues, all of whom except for National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir voted in favor of the ceasefire. Only one in five government supporters were in favor of the deal, with over double, 45%, saying they were against it. Almost the same percentage, 22%, opined that the bottom line was that Israel had actually lost to the terrorists. The majority of them also disagreed with their politicians’ claims regarding the durability of the agreement, when asked by Channel 12 how much time they thought it would last. A mere 19% said it would last years, with 27% answering 'a few months' and 38% saying it would collapse even faster. Interestingly, the Opposition supporters were not tremendously hopeful either, with 27% saying it would last years, 29% answering 'months' and 26% saying it would tank in only a short time. In light of the shutdown of one front, Channel 13 added a question about the fighting in Gaza against Hamas, asking whether the government should end the war there and pursue a hostage deal. Fully 66% of the respondents said it should be ended, while 27% said the IDF should continue fighting and seven percent answering that they did not know.

Biden administration ‘incredibly concerned’ after Israel ends use...	US State Department expresses dismay after Israeli defense minister ends controversial use of arrest without trial as a preemptive measure against Israeli citizens living in Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration this week expressed dismay after the Israeli government ended the controversial use of emergency powers to detain Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria without trial as a preemptive security measure. Last Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) announced that he had instructed his ministry to halt the practice of using administrative arrest or detention against Israeli citizens living in Judea and Samaria. 'In the current climate, where Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria face significant threats of Palestinian terrorism, supported by the Iranian axis of evil seeking to establish a terror front against Israel, and where international sanctions unfairly target settlers and settlement organizations, it is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such a severe step,' Katz said. Katz emphasized that police and the Shin Bet internal security agency would still be able to use standard law enforcement methods to prevent criminal acts, or to apprehend suspects and bring them to justice. The U.S. State Department, however, expressed grave concerns regarding the change, saying it was one of the few effective 'tools' used by the Israeli government to crack down on 'illegal activity' by 'extremist Israeli settlers.' 'We see the announcement that administrative detentions will no longer be applied to extremist Israeli settlers as a rolling back of one of the limited tools that was effectively being used by the Israeli Government to rein in this illegal activity,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters on Monday. The Biden administration, he continued is 'incredibly concerned about the increasing extremist violence in the West Bank, including assaults on civilians, forced displacement of Palestinian communities, and the willful destruction of homes and farms.' 'We have called on the Government of Israel repeatedly to take further actions to deter extremist settler violence and to hold those engaging in it accountable.' Administrative detentions are a holdover from the British Mandate period, implemented as a emergency regulation beginning in 1945. Following the establishment of Israel in 1948, the policy of holding individuals in prison for up to six months at a time without trial was continued as an emergency measure to combat Arab terrorism and other immediate security threats. While administrative measures have been primarily used against Arab terrorists, they have also been employed at times against Jews - including American citizens.

Iran tracking of thousands of Israelis as potential targets – rep...	Chabad Rabbi Zvi Kogan is believed to have been killed in the UAE after his phone was hacked. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Iran is tracking of thousands of Israelis as potential targets, with several hundred considered at 'high risk' and one already dead, Israel Hayom reported Wednesday. Citing security sources, the paper said that the Iranians have been at it for over a decade, but that in recent years their efforts have skyrocketed due to their ability to hack into phone and personal computers to reveal massive amounts of personal information. This includes home addresses, phone numbers, family details, social networks, places of work and other data that enables the mullahs’ intelligence agencies to know where people are going, when and with whom. The report said that it 'is believed' that the Iranian cell that murdered Chabad Rabbi Zvi Kogan in the UAE several days ago had access to his phone. Most of the Iranian cyber effort is focused on obtaining information on targets inside Israel. Some of them, the report said, have already received direct threats in the form of 'birthday greetings' that say they may not live to see their next birthday. Israeli security has contacted all those considered at high risk, including senior defense officials, to warn them to be on alert as well as avoid traveling abroad. The report said that 'intelligence assessments project Iran will escalate' its efforts against such targets 'imminently,' due to Tehran’s 'mounting losses' in its direct and indirect conflict with Israel over the past year. Iran’s most important proxy, Hezbollah, has had its military and political leadership decimated and most of its rocket threat dissipated by the IDF, forcing it into agreeing Tuesday to a ceasefire that includes a retreat well away from Israel’s northern border. Meanwhile, Hamas has been reduced to mainly guerrilla tactics in the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip as the vast majority of its fighting force has been destroyed. Iran itself has been left without meaningful air defense after the Israeli air force demolished it last month following two unsuccessful attempts to hit the Jewish state with hundreds of missiles. The Islamic Republic has established terror cells in many countries over the years who could be activated against those Tehran considers of value, including Israeli academics and scientists as well as current and former government officials. Several uncovered plots have been widely reported on, in places ranging from Western Europe to Turkey to Thailand, which came to naught thanks in large part to Israeli intelligence personnel working with their counterparts in these countries to arrest the criminals in time. Several spy cells were recently caught in Israel itself, charged with taking pictures of sensitive facilities, carrying out surveillance operations on individuals, and even in a very few cases beginning to actively prepare to attack certain people. The motivation in most cases seems to be money, although those arrested have also included Palestinians from eastern Jerusalem as well as Israeli Jews and Arabs.

Turkey faces congressional heat over Hamas hospitality	The initiative has drawn support from prominent organizations, including the American Jewish Committee, whose managing director of policy Julie Fishman Rayman condemned Turkey’s harboring of terrorists as 'outrageous.' By Jewish Breaking News Turkey has come under intense congressional pressure following reports that the country is providing safe haven to senior Hamas terrorists. In a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Intelligence Director Avril Haines, 39 bipartisan House members are demanding immediate classified briefings about the scope and security implications of Turkey’s deepening relationship with the terrorist organization. 'We are alarmed by recent reports that senior members of Hamas’s leadership have relocated to Turkey with the intent of establishing a headquarters there,' the letter states. 'We have serious concerns about the security implications of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member hosting, and potentially aiding, Hamas, a U.S. and E.U.-designated foreign terrorist organization.' The initiative has drawn support from prominent organizations including the American Jewish Committee, whose managing director of policy Julie Fishman Rayman condemned Turkey’s harboring of terrorists as 'outrageous.' A Turkish diplomatic source speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity rejected reports claiming that Hamas had relocated its political headquarters from Qatar to Turkey, claiming that Hamas members only make periodic visits to the country. On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that he will stand by Arabs with all his 'strength and means' until 'Palestine is fully liberated.' 'What Turkey is doing for Palestine, Gaza, and Lebanon is far greater than what is visible,' Erdogan said. 'For 14 months, a highly bloody and extremely dangerous war has been ongoing right next to Turkey, despite some individuals’ insistence on ignoring it.' Erdogan also said that he has been actively pushing the United Nations to implement 'coercive measures to stop Israeli aggression,' which he claimed 'has now spilled over into Syria and other countries.'

Cruz: ‘Deeply disturbed’ by reports ‘Obama-Biden officials exerte...	Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he is 'very pleased to hear that a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has been reached regarding the conflict in Lebanon.' By Izzy Salant and Menachem Wecker, JNS Although Israel has achieved 'enormous military successes' over the past year against Hezbollah, the Biden administration 'has spent the last four years pathologically obsessed with undermining Israel and boosting Iran,' stated Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) after U.S. President Joe Biden announced a ceasefire deal in Lebanon. 'They are now using the transition period to the Trump administration and a Republican Congress to try to lock in those efforts—and to constrain the incoming administration—by establishing what they believe to be irreversible diplomatic, legal and military policies,' Cruz added. 'However, these and similar international policies are not irreversible.' The senator added that he is 'deeply disturbed' by reports that 'Obama-Biden officials exerted enormous pressure on our Israeli allies to accept this ceasefire' and by how the officials 'are characterizing Israel’s obligations.' 'This pressure and these statements are further efforts to undermine Israel and constrain the incoming Trump administration,' Cruz stated. 'Obama-Biden officials pressured our Israeli allies into accepting the ceasefire by withholding weapons they needed to defend themselves and counter Hezbollah, and by threatening to facilitate a further, broader, binding international arms embargo through the United Nations.' Those U.S. officials aim to 'use Israel’s acceptance of this ceasefire to ensure that Hezbollah and other Iranian terrorist groups remain intact across Lebanon, and to limit Israel’s future freedom of action and self-defense,' Cruz stated. Several of Cruz’s colleagues in Congress also addressed the agreement. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he is 'very pleased to hear that a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has been reached regarding the conflict in Lebanon.' 'I appreciate the hard work of the Biden administration, supported by President Trump, to make this ceasefire a reality,' Graham said. 'This ceasefire will protect Israel from another Oct. 7 and will give the people of Lebanon a break from the fighting.' 'My hope is that we can soon achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and allow peaceful solutions to replace endless conflict,' he added. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the agreement 'marks a vital and productive step, but hopefully not the last.' 'Lebanon’s Parliament can and must select a president free from corruption and Iranian influence,' he added. 'The United States remains committed to ensuring the ceasefire holds with strong and ongoing support for the Lebanese Armed Forces—the true defenders of Lebanon’s sovereignty and people—and for Israel’s right to defend itself against terrorism.' Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) wrote that 'for over a year, Israel has faced ongoing attacks from Hezbollah, a terrorist organization backed by Iran. Today’s agreement will help save lives and allow Israel to fully focus on defeating Hamas.' 'It also makes it clear Hamas is isolated and must free the remaining hostages now,' the senator stated. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) wrote earlier in the day about the ceasefire deal that there was 'a clear message to all Iranian proxies: The Trump administration will not tolerate violence against Israel. The Middle East cannot continue to be a breeding ground for terror and chaos.' Rep. Katie Boyd Britt (R-Ala.) wrote that she supports 'the democratically elected government of Israel’s decision to enter this ceasefire deal.' 'I also stand with Israel in her right to enforce this agreement, including striking Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon if necessary,' Britt said. 'The United States stands with Israel today and always.' Rep. Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) said that the agreement 'is a breakthrough that will save countless innocent lives and demonstrates that diplomacy can work in the Middle East.' 'Hopefully, his efforts will create momentum for a ceasefire in Gaza and a lessening of violence in the entire region,' the congressman said. ‘Pave the way for a more stable future’ U.S. Jewish groups applauded the deal. The Jewish Federations of North America welcomed the agreement and said Israel 'has long endured the unacceptable threat of Iran’s proxy Hezbollah amassing heavy weapons along its northern border, and since Oct. 8, 2023, firing regular missiles, drones and rockets, forcing over 60,000 people to evacuate their homes.' 'Throughout this harrowing period, Jewish Federations have been there to support Israel’s communities, and we will continue to support them in their needs going forward,' it stated. 'We are hopeful that this agreement will help pave the way for a more stable future, allow Israel’s citizens to return to their homes, and end the unacceptable rain of rockets and missiles that have terrorized Israel’s civilians these past 14 months.' The American Jewish Committee stated that 'as Israel has done time and time again, it has chosen to agree to a ceasefire at the risk of huge potential costs.' 'To protect this peace, enforcement from the Lebanese army, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, and U.S. Central Command will be paramount,' the AJC stated. 'As long as Hezbollah, funded by the Iranian regime to eradicate Israel, remains on its border, Israel and her people are under threat.' It added that 'much of this deal is based on the original tenets of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which has failed to be enforced since its adoption in 2006.' 'While AJC welcomes the new enforcement mechanisms in this agreement, we will continue to advocate for a reassessment of UNIFIL’s mandate and operations,' AJC added. 'As recently as last August, UNIFIL’s mandate was simply renewed without the necessary adjustments to address the threat posed by Hezbollah. Without meaningful reforms, UNIFIL will continue to fall short of its mandate.' AIPAC stated that 'this war was a direct byproduct of Iran arming and funding its terror proxy Hezbollah and the international community’s failure to enforce Security Council Resolution 1701 after the 2006 war.' It called on the international community to 'remedy its failures following the 2006 war and ensure Hezbollah can’t rearm or operate south of the Litani River.' Mark Mellman, president and CEO of Democratic Majority for Israel, stated that the 'ceasefire achievement reaffirms our long-standing belief that this is the most pro-Israel administration in American history.' He added that the agreement 'protects Israel’s security.' 'Reminder: There is no peace agreement. The goal of the Tehran regime and its proxy terror armies (in this case, Hezbollah) remains the destruction of Israel,' wrote Gerald Steinberg, founder and president of NGO Monitor. 'In response, and based on the lessons of the past 14 months, Israel will act with force and preemptively whenever its survival is threatened.'

Israeli experts deem the PA unfit to govern in Gaza	The report describes the P.A. as lacking legitimacy among Palestinians and failing to maintain control over its territories, with parts falling under Hamas’s influence. By JNS The Palestinian Authority is unfit to govern the Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the Israel-Hamas war, according to a new report by the Kohelet Policy Forum. The 112-page report, authored by attorneys Yishai Rivlin, Yigal Ram, Boaz Ha’etzni and Noga Arbel, presents a critical analysis of the P.A.’s ideology and actions. It concludes that the P.A. promotes a culture of terror and jihad rather than fostering peaceful coexistence. The report, titled, 'Why the Palestinian Authority Must Not Rule Gaza,' highlights that the P.A.’s education system indoctrinates children with hatred toward Israel and Jews, using textbooks and educational programs to portray Israel as an enemy. Furthermore, the P.A. consistently refuses to recognize Israel as a Jewish state, omitting it from official maps and labeling Israeli cities as Palestinian. This refusal is seen as a fundamental barrier to peace efforts. The report, which can be read in its full Hebrew version here, also accuses the P.A. of actively encouraging terrorism by praising terrorists, hosting commemorative events in their honor and providing financial incentives through salaries to imprisoned terrorists and their families. These payments are viewed as significant motivators for continued violence and antithetical to peace. Additionally, the report describes the P.A. as lacking legitimacy among Palestinians and failing to maintain control over its territories, with parts falling under Hamas’s influence. Systemic human rights violations and corruption further undermine its credibility as a governing body. The authors warn that allowing the P.A. to govern Gaza without significant ideological changes could result in another terrorist entity on Israel’s southern border, echoing concerns from post-2005 when Israel withdrew from Gaza, leading to increased Hamas control. From a human rights perspective, the report argues that P.A. governance would not improve conditions for Gazans but rather perpetuate existing abuses. The report, which was written in September but first made public by Israel National News on Tuesday, includes findings that have been echoed by some Israeli Knesset members who have likewise come out against proposals involving the P.A. in governing Gaza. Among the reasons given by the MKs were doubts regarding the feasibility of armed P.A. officers working alongside the Israeli military. Despite U.S. assertions made in September regarding the P.A.’s commitment to peace, ongoing terror attacks claimed by Fatah militias cast doubt on these commitments’ sincerity. Talks between the P.A. and Hamas that took place in Cairo toward the end of September regarding a unity government for Gaza further complicate the situation, as such a government would result in Hamas still being in control of the Strip in some fashion or another after the war. The Kohelet Policy Forum’s report becomes even more relevant amid the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah and continued efforts by the U.S. government to bring about an end to the conflict in Gaza as well. The report’s findings underscore the need for substantial reforms within the P.A. before it can be considered a viable governing body in the Gaza Strip.

Ceasefire tested as Israeli forces engage suspects near Lebanese ...	Residents of southern Lebanon began returning to their homes on Wednesday morning, prompting Israeli warnings not to do so until the army withdraws from Lebanon. By Pesach Benson, TPS Hours after the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire took effect, Israeli forces identified several vehicles in Lebanese territory with suspects in a no-go zone, the Israel Defense Forces said on Wednesday morning. 'The forces fired to prevent them from reaching the zone, and the suspects moved away,' the IDF said. 'The Air Force is prepared to operate throughout Lebanon and the air defense system is on high alert. As of this time, there is no change in the Home Front Command’s instructions.' Meanwhile, residents of southern Lebanon began returning to their homes on Wednesday morning, prompting Israeli warnings not to do so until the army withdraws from Lebanon. 'The IDF remains deployed in its positions inside southern Lebanon,' tweeted Col. Avichay Adraee, the Israel Defense Force’s Arabic-language spokesperson. 'You are prohibited from heading towards the villages that the IDF has ordered to be evacuated or towards IDF forces in the area. For your safety and the safety of your family members, refrain from moving to the area. We will inform you when it is safe to return home.' The two-month ceasefire went into effect at 4:00 AM. Under the terms of the agreement, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its armed presence from areas of southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. Israeli forces will also withdraw from southern Lebanon in stages. The Lebanese Armed Forces are to be deployed in southern Lebanon including along the 120 km border with Israel, as will monitors from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hezbollah not required to disarm under ceasefire deal	13-point Lebanon truce allows Hezbollah to continue to function, with no explicit requirement to disarm, while Israel commits to avoiding military action in most of Lebanon unless Lebanese army found to be unable to remove threats to Israel. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News At 4:00 a.m. Wednesday morning, a ceasefire agreement between Israel, Lebanon, and the Hezbollah terrorist organization went into effect, ending active combat in southern Lebanon and Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern and central Israel. The truce, brokered by the United States and France, includes 13 different provisions, along with assurances provided by the Biden administration to Israel, delineating Israel's right to self-defense in Lebanon under the ceasefire. While the deal is anchored in the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, passed in August 2006 to end the Second Lebanon War, it makes no explicit call for the disarming of terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, as UNSC 1701 had. Instead, the agreement merely requires that Hezbollah and other armed groups in Lebanon refrain from attacking Israel. Furthermore, the deal obliges the Lebanese government to supervise all weapons sales, transfers, and production in Lebanese territory, with unauthorized arms production facilities to be dismantled, along with unauthorized military bases and infrastructure. Unauthorized weapons are to be confiscated by the Lebanese military or security apparatus. Israel will also be obliged to refrain from carrying out any military activity in Lebanese territory, so long as the truce is maintained, though Israel will retain the right to conduct aerial reconnaissance in Lebanese airspace, so long as aircraft do not break the sound barrier. The text of the agreement reaffirms the right of both Israel and Lebanon to self-defense, while a letter from the Biden administration delineates more precisely Israel's right to act militarily in Lebanon both in response to violations of the ceasefire, and to security threats by armed groups in Lebanon. Israel will, according to the U.S. letter of understanding, have the right to act militarily against security threats in Lebanon, including any violations of the ceasefire deal in southern Lebanon, with no limit to Israel's freedom of action. North of the Litani River, however, Israel can only act against security threats if the Lebanese army is unable or unwilling to remove the threat. Israel must, whenever possible, inform the U.S. of planned military measures. The implementation of the deal will be overseen by a committee led by the U.S. and including France. Violations of the ceasefire are to be reported to the committee and to the United Nations peacekeeping force (UNIFIL) deployed in southern Lebanon. Israel is required to withdraw all of its forces from Lebanese territory and move south of the Blue Line within 60 days. In addition, the agreement provides for U.S.-brokered talks between Israel and Lebanon to resolve lingering disputes over the precise demarcation of the border. The full list of provisions in the agreement is as follows: Hezbollah and other terror groups are to refrain from attacking Israel Israel is to refrain from carrying out attacks in Lebanon, so long as truce maintained Jerusalem and Beirut are work to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, including removal of Hezbollah from the Israeli border, up to the Litani River Israel and Lebanon will both retain the right to self-defense The Lebanese army is to be sole armed force south of the Litani River after Israel completes its withdrawal within 60 days Beirut is to supervise all arms sales, production and transfers in Lebanon Unauthorized weapon production facilities are to be dismantled Unauthorized military bases and infrastructure and weapons must be dismantled or confiscated A committee, headed by U.S. and including France, will be formed to oversee implementation of the deal Israel and Lebanon are to report violations to the committee and to the UNIFIL mission Lebanon is obliged to use its military to enforce its borders and border crossings Israel must withdraw all forces from Lebanon within 60 days U.S. will promote indirect talks between Jerusalem and Beirut to resolve disputes over the Blue Line, demarcating the Israel-Lebanon frontier The post Hezbollah not required to disarm under ceasefire deal appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/hezbollah-not-required-to-disarm-under-ceasefire-deal/	2024-11-27T00:30:48-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/6dc1ef95-12f0-4104-b4c9-47a21f6967fb.jpg
‘Gazans have been through hell’ – After Lebanon ceasefire, Biden ...	Biden touts ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, while holding out hope truce could lead to breakthrough on hostage deal - and a path to Palestinian statehood. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden on Tuesday touted an agreement brokered by the United States between Israel, Lebanon, and the Hezbollah terror organization paving the way for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah beginning Wednesday morning. Addressing reporters at a White House Rose Garden press conference Tuesday afternoon, Biden announced there was 'good news to report from the Middle East,' after Israel's security cabinet voted to accept a truce with the Iran-backed Hezbollah terror group, and to withdraw all Israeli forces from Lebanese territory within 60 days. 'I just spoke with the prime minister of Israel and Lebanon, and I’m pleased to announce that their governments have accepted the United States’ proposal to end the devastating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah,' Biden said. The president emphasized that the U.S. held Hezbollah, not Israel, responsible for the war on Israel's northern front, which began a day after Hamas' invasion of southern Israel on October 7th, 2023. 'Let’s be clear: Israel did not launch this war. The Lebanese people did not seek that war either, nor did the United States.' Biden added that the ceasefire was 'designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,' rather than a temporary truce in between rounds of fighting. 'What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed — will — I emphasize — will not be allowed to threaten the security of Israel again.' 'We’re determined this conflict will not be just another cycle of violence.' No American troops will be deployed in Lebanon, Biden said, though the U.S. and France will monitor the area to ensure compliance with the truce. The president expressed optimism that Wednesday's ceasefire could be built upon to secure a deal between Israel and Hamas, and lamented the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. 'Just as the Lebanese people deserve a future of security and prosperity, so do the people of Gaza. They too deserve an end to the fighting and displacement.' 'The people of Gaza have been through hell. Their word — their world is absolutely shattered.' 'Over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and the end to the war without Hamas in power — that it becomes possible.' Biden also used the Lebanon truce to reiterate his hope that talks to end the current conflicts in the Middle East may become the basis for negotiations leading to Palestinian statehood. 'Today’s announcement brings us closer to realizing&#8230; a vision for the future of the Middle East where it’s at peace and prosperous and integrated across borders; a future where Palestinians have a state of their own.' The U.S., Biden continued 'remains prepared to conclude a set of historic deals with Saudi Arabia to include a security pact and economic assurances together with a credible pathway for establishing a Palestinian state and the full&#8230; normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.'

US still withholding weapons from Israel, says US House Speaker	This Administration put up roadblock after roadblock on Israel and dragged out this conflict,' says senior Republican official. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration is continuing to punish Israel by delaying shipments of critical weapons and munitions, in order to appease Iranian aggression, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-TN) said on Tuesday evening after news of a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon was announced. 'While the Biden-Harris Administration celebrates this announcement, remember that it is STILL withholding weapons to Israel. This Administration put up roadblock after roadblock on Israel and dragged out this conflict,' wrote Johnson on his X account. In a televised address to the Israeli public on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited 'delays' in arms shipments as one of the reasons why Israel had agreed to the ceasefire. Notably, Netanyahu was vague on the details of the issue, and did not mention the Biden administration as withholding arms. 'They repeatedly appeased Iran rather than show unequivocal support to our closest ally in the region. Israel’s military success has been in spite of the White House, not because of it,' he continued. 'We always hope for peace in the region, and still do during this 60-day ceasefire. But it is President Trump’s Administration that will pave the way to lasting peace, because peace only comes through STRENGTH,' he added. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL), incoming president Donald Trump's pick for National Security Adviser, said that the ceasefire agreement was directly linked to Trump's election. 'Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump,' Waltz wrote on his TX account. 'This is [because] his resounding victory sent a clear message to the rest of the world that chaos won’t be tolerated. I’m glad to see concrete steps towards de-escalation in the Middle East,' Waltz wrote. 'But let’s be clear: The Iran Regime is the root cause of the chaos and terror that has been unleashed across the region. We will not tolerate the status quo of their support for terrorism.'

Israeli Security Cabinet approves truce with Lebanon	The ceasefire is set to go into effect at 10 a.m. local time on Wednesday and last for sixty days. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS The Israeli Security Cabinet voted on Tuesday evening to approve a 60-day truce with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon. An unnamed Israeli official told CNN that Jerusalem’s Security Cabinet, which is responsible for defense-related decisions and composed of senior ministers, voted in favor of the agreement with Lebanon. Earlier on Tuesday, the channel cited an Israeli source familiar with the matter as saying that the prime minister was seeking to bring the deal before the Security Cabinet only, rather than the full Cabinet. Hebrew media has quoted officials as saying that the potential move would be legally sound, as a temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah is considered a security question rather than a political one. According to the reported terms of the agreement, Israel Defense Forces troops are expected to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon over a 60-day 'transition period,' while the country’s official Lebanese Armed Forces is deployed to the border region. Jerusalem has pledged to halt 'any offensive military action against targets in Lebanon, including on the ground, in the air and at sea.' Hezbollah has promised to relocate its 'military infrastructure' north of the Litani River, located some 18 miles north of the border with Israel. The deal includes an oversight committee, which the United States will lead, to monitor implementation and address potential violations. The ceasefire is set to go into effect at 10 a.m. local time on Wednesday, per NBN, which is part of the Hezbollah-aligned Amal movement. An unnamed Israeli official likewise told Axios that the truce is expected to take effect on Wednesday morning, after U.S. President Joe Biden announces it on Tuesday night. As the Israeli Security Cabinet met to approve the deal on Tuesday evening, air-raid sirens were activated across the Galilee and Haifa regions, warning of more rocket and missile fire from Lebanon. Meanwhile, the IDF issued evacuation orders for structures in the Lebanese cities of Tyre and Sidon, announcing that the Israeli military would 'soon act against Hezbollah infrastructure located in the area.' Hassan Fadlallah, a Lebanese lawmaker representing Hezbollah’s March 8 Alliance, told the Reuters wire agency earlier on Tuesday that the terrorist organization would 'remain active' after the war ends, including to help rebuild areas destroyed by Israeli airstrikes. A Hezbollah official told Qatar’s Al Jazeera following the Israeli approval that the terror group still needs to 'examine the points that Netanyahu agreed to before the [Lebanese] government signs tomorrow.' Authorities in northern Israel have canceled public gatherings until Thursday, anticipating a flare-up in violence ahead of the truce. On Sunday, Hezbollah fired more than 240 projectiles at Israel, marking one of the most intense days of hostilities since the Lebanese terror group joined the war in support of Palestinian Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023. Lawmakers of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee sent an urgent request to Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday afternoon to reveal the terms of the agreement under discussion. 'Following publications about Israel’s intention to sign a deal in the north, we, representatives of the undersigned coalition and opposition parties, demand to summon Defense Minister Israel Katz, to present the principles of the agreement,' the coalition Knesset members Amit Halevi (Likud) and Ohad Tal (Religious Zionism) stated. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a senior member of the Security Cabinet, informed Netanyahu of his four demands for supporting the agreement, Israel’s Channel 12 News reported. The Religious Zionism leader reportedly pressed the premier to call a Cabinet vote on every withdrawal from Lebanon, respond to Lebanese violations of the deal within 48 hours, hold the government in Beirut responsible for any attack from Lebanese territory and ban rebuilding destroyed infrastructure in Southern Lebanon. Hezbollah has attacked the Jewish state nearly daily for more than a year, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones across the border. More than 60,000 residents of Israel’s north remain internally displaced due to the ongoing cross-border attacks from Lebanon. The attacks have killed at least 76 people in Israel, including 31 IDF soldiers and six foreign nationals. More than 700 have been wounded. Jerusalem has escalated attacks on Hezbollah since adding the return of displaced citizens to northern Israel to its official war goals on Sept. 17. On Sept. 30, the IDF announced that ground forces had moved to 'limited, localized and targeted raids' inside Lebanon. More than 40 IDF troops were killed by Hezbollah terrorists during the two-month-long ground maneuver, according to official military data. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which brought an end to the 2006 Lebanon War but was never enforced, mandated the complete removal of Hezbollah south of the Litani River and banned the presence of armed groups in Lebanon except for the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers.

During the battle, he was injured and placed on life support. Brief was on life support for 413 days before succumbing to his injuries. He is survived by his parents. More than 50 Israelis were massacred at Kfar Aza. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Israel to build high-tech security wall along Jordanian border	While the exact completion timeline remains under wraps, ministry officials indicated construction will begin within months. By Jewish Breaking News Although Jordan remains one of Israel’s few Arab allies, Iranian smuggling networks are treating their shared border like an open highway for terror operations. That’s all about to change. Defense Minister Israel Katz announced Tuesday he’s won approval for a sophisticated multi-million shekel border barrier, loaded with cutting-edge sensors and surveillance networks, to close a critical 309-mile security gap that Tehran has increasingly exploited. 'We see a relentless and institutionalized Iranian effort to establish an eastern front against the State of Israel. I have decided to intensively promote the construction of the fence on the eastern border between Israel and Jordan. We are going to do it very quickly,' Katz said. Katz first called for the construction of a fence on the border with Jordan in late August, when he served as Foreign Minister. At the time he accused Tehran of working to create an 'eastern terror front against Israel.' However, security officials have been raising red flags about the border’s vulnerabilities since early 2023. Former IDF Central Commander Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs went so far as to send a formal warning letter to IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi before his retirement. The October 7 Hamas attack only intensified these concerns, though questions remain about whether the IDF will boost troop presence along the new barrier or rely primarily on technology. According to the Jerusalem Post, Katz had to overcome longtime opposition from Finance Minister Betzalel Smotrich, who had repeatedly blocked funding despite growing security concerns. Sources suggest Katz may have leveraged rescinding any new administrative detention orders against violent Jewish activists in Judea and Samaria to secure Smotrich’s cooperation. While the exact completion timeline remains under wraps, ministry officials indicated construction will begin within months. Defense Ministry Director-General Eyal Zamir has already ordered Brig. Gen. Eran Ofir’s engineering division to begin mapping the challenging terrain and producing specialized barrier materials.'

Nearly 1 million migrants have entered the US through the Biden-H...	Total migrant encounters recorded by law enforcement have exceeded nine million since Biden took office. By Joseph Simonson, The Washington Free Beacon Up to one million migrants are expected to have entered the United States under the controversial CPB One program by the time President Joe Biden leaves office, with the figure already nearing 900,000, according to internal Department of Homeland Security data obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. CBP One allows migrants who want to claim asylum in the United States to apply for the program in their home country using a mobile phone application. Those migrants are then given court dates, which are often scheduled years later. The Biden administration broadly expanded the program last year under the belief that it would ease pressure on the southern border. That decision prompted criticism from Republicans who said CBP One was nothing more than a way to facilitate illegal immigration and mask the true number of individuals entering the country. Migrants who enter the country via CBP One are not counted by law enforcement agencies as traditional border crossers. However few are aware of the scale of CBP One. Data obtained by the Free Beacon show that more than 880,620 migrants have been processed with the program since Nov. 2, 2023. The data show a plurality of the migrants, more than 210,000, have come from Venezuela. That's in addition to 175,000 arrivals from Cuba, 152,000 from Mexico, and 146,000 from Haiti. More than 453,000 received parole at a foreign airport, meaning those migrants took a flight from another country and were able to freely roam the United States once they landed. Data reveal that migrants have used the CBP One app from six continents. Biden pledged last year that DHS would only allow roughly 43,000 CBP One appointments a month. That number quickly rose without any public announcement, the Free Beacon reported earlier this year. DHS officials who spoke with the Free Beacon believe that the program is on pace to hit the million-migrant mark by Biden’s last day. Such a figure in just over a year is staggeringly high compared to previous administrations. In 2018, for example, law enforcement encountered just under 400,000 migrants at the southern border—less than half the amount the Biden administration has allowed to enter the United States via CBP One. Total migrant encounters recorded by law enforcement have exceeded nine million since Biden took office. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was impeached in January over his handling of the border crisis. Among the charges listed in his articles of impeachment was the creation of CBP One, described as 'a series of categorical parole programs never authorized by Congress for foreign nationals outside of the United States.' President-elect Donald Trump is expected to severely curtail or end CBP One. Trump said on the campaign trail that after he takes office, 'The border will be sealed. The invasion will be stopped. The migrant flights will end, and Kamala's app for illegals will be shut down immediately, within 24 hours.' The chaos on the southern border is considered a primary reason why Trump won his second term, as well as the popular vote—a first for a Republican since 2004. Trump has pledged to undertake the largest deportation effort in U.S. history, although those close to him say law enforcement will first target illegal aliens with criminal backgrounds. Such a policy has led to criticism from Democrats, although it appears to be popular with the public. A CBS poll released Sunday found that 57 percent of voters approve of Trump 'starting [a] program to deport all immigrants in [the] U.S. illegally.'

Sociology professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University calls for IDF soldiers to refuse orders, accusing the Jewish state of 'ethnically cleansing' the northern Gaza Strip during the ongoing war against Hamas. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli university lecturer is under fire after she accused the military of 'ethnically cleansing' the northern Gaza Strip during the ongoing war against the Hamas terror organization, and penned an opinion article calling on Israeli soldiers to refuse orders during the war in Gaza. Earlier this month, the left-wing Hebrew daily Ha’aretz published an article coauthored by journalist Meron Rapoport and Dr. Yael Barda, assistant professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem’s Department of Sociology and Anthropology. 'Israel has perpetrated ethnic cleansing in the northern Gaza Strip,' reads the opening line of the opinion piece. 'Through starvation, denial of health care, bombings and the destruction of both homes and the schools where the displaced sought shelter, Israel has forced the vast majority of residents of the Jabalya refugee camp, Beith Hanoun and Beit Lahia to leave their place of residence.' Rapoport and Barda also explicitly call on Israeli soldiers to refuse orders from their commanding officers in wartime. 'Refusing to serve was and remains the strongest card we have to play against the current government's plans for perpetual war. And that's especially true now, since Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election may well remove the brakes that have until now prevented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his partners from completing the ethnic cleansing of Gaza City.' On Monday, the pro-Israel activist group Im Tirtzu called on Hebrew University administrators to fire Barda over her accusations and call to refuse orders. 'I have just returned from a long period of reserve duty, in Gaza and Lebanon, and I discover that a senior lecturer at the university where I studied is calling for defection and claiming that what the IDF does in Gaza is ethnic cleansing,' said the CEO of Im Tirtzu, Matan Jerafi. 'It is unbelievable that students who have returned from reserve duty should study with her? The war is unfortunately revealing the ugly face of some of the Israeli academia, the university president has an obligation to fire her!'

‘No Way In Hell Gaza Is a State’ – Republican senator tussles wit...	‘Beyond the pale’ - Republican senator fires back after Canadian foreign minister defends decision to enforce International Criminal Court arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. By World Israel News Staff Canada’s foreign minister defended the Trudeau government’s decision to enforce arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court at The Hague against Israeli leaders, pushing back on criticism by Republican lawmakers last week. Speaking with the news website Politico in an interview published Sunday, Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly responded to threats by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a senior Republican in the upper chamber of Congress where Republicans are poised to take control in January, after Graham warned Congress would impose sanctions on allied nations which aid and abet the ICC decision. 'Canada will take its decision,' Joly said. 'Then the U.S. will take its decision.' 'We abide by international norms, including the fact that we’re a founding member of the ICC.' 'For us, it is not a political question. It is a legal question, and it is part also of our own legal system that we respect the jurisdiction of the ICC. Period.' Joly noted that unlike Canada, the U.S. is not a signatory to the Rome Statute which established the ICC. On Monday, Senator Graham fired back, calling Canada’s support for the ICC arrest warrants 'beyond the pale.' 'The idea that the International Criminal Court seeking arrest warrants against Israel’s Prime Minister and former Defense Minister is an act of international rules-based order is beyond the pale,' Graham said in a press release. 'The prosecutor who instigated the arrest warrants is under investigation. The ICC, in the eyes of the majority of Congress, is acting as a rogue organization asserting jurisdiction based on their belief that something bad happened.' Graham ripped the ICC for arguing that the Gaza Strip has standing as a sovereign state, and emphasized that Israel is not a party to the ICC treaty. 'Israel is not a member of the ICC, and there is no way in hell that Gaza is part of a recognized Palestinian state. This abuse of jurisdiction has no limits.' 'Why couldn’t the ICC come after an American president or Secretary of Defense if they feel we have done wrong?' 'This is about sovereignty and some semblance of the rule of law. From an American point of view, the ICC has no accountability. For them to come after us would be an attack on our sovereignty. Since we’re not a member, and we are a mature democracy with an independent judiciary, like Israel, we would have little to no say.' The U.S., Graham added, will 'act decisively to reject' actions by the ICC outside of its jurisdiction targeting democratic countries. 'We will make it loud and clear that those countries who assist in enforcing the arrest warrants – even if they are close allies – will hit a wall of resistance in America.'

Netanyahu faces possible backlash within Likud over Lebanon cease...	Israel is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, according to these opponents of a ceasefire agreement now with Hezbollah. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News While the Lebanese foreign minister said Tuesday that he hopes an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal will be agreed upon by nightfall, there are loud voices in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s own party who are throwing cold water on the idea of stopping the fight now against the Iranian terror proxy. Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli stated, 'The series of strikes on Hezbollah's top brass and the ground moves have brought tremendous operational achievements. Under no circumstances should they be sold in exchange for quiet&#8230;. We have already learned firsthand what the interest rates are for buying quiet in the Middle Eastern bazaar.' Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter announced on X Monday night without going into details that 'If the agreement with Lebanon is a 'copy-paste' of Resolution 1701 — I won't support it.' He then said he would decide on his stance after hearing the details of the planned deal, which is supposed to be presented to the political-security cabinet towards evening Tuesday. Several Likud backbenchers have expressed firm opposition to signing an agreement before Hezbollah suffers a much more serious, if not fatal, blow. Calling it a 'return to the approach of October 6,' MK Moshe Saada posted that, 'Instead of reaching an overwhelming victory deal thanks to the achievements of the last few month&#8230;the State of Israel is the one deterred.' 'We do not have a mandate to keep the rocket threat alive and kicking,' he continued, 'and we do not have a moral mandate to ask the residents of the north to return to their homes, when it’s clear to everyone that a large part of the Lebanese residents who will be allowed to return to their villages are actually terrorists who are just waiting for another chance.' He pleaded with Netanyahu to instead 'listen to the council heads, the residents of the north, and the majority of the country’s people who demand [Hezbollah’s] surrender and submission and not our capitulation.' MK Dan Illouz agreed, writing on X, 'Israel is seemingly choosing to retreat instead of leveraging tactical achievements into strategic ones.' The proposed deal states that the Lebanese Army will take the IDF’s place in southern Lebanon within 60 days, yet, he pointed out, 'This army is controlled by a government in which Hezbollah is a key component.' He noted with contempt the recourses Israel has if Hezbollah returns to the south and rearms. The international oversight body to be established will be 'an empty vessel,' he said. 'As if anyone in the world will lift a finger as a result of an [Israeli] complaint.' An American letter of commitment stating that Israel will have freedom of action to actively deter Hezbollah if it breaks the agreement will be useless as well, he added, as previous presidents’ written promises to Israeli leaders were not honored by their successors. If this deal is signed, he ended, 'Hezbollah is still on its feet, ready to rebuild its strength [and] the next round is just a matter of time.' Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yisrael Katz talked tough upon meeting with UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert Tuesday. He demanded 'effective enforcement from UNIFIL' of any agreement but also warned, 'What was will no longer be. We will act against every threat, anytime and anywhere. Any house in southern Lebanon that is rebuilt and established as a terrorist base will be destroyed. Every rearmament and terrorist regrouping will be struck, every attempt to smuggle weapons will be thwarted and any threat to our forces or to Israeli citizens will be destroyed immediately.' According to Channel 12’s Amit Segal, the deal is purposefully being brought to a vote only in the political-security cabinet, and not to the larger Cabinet as representing the government as a whole, or the Knesset, the people’s representatives, where the opposition is greater. The excuse given for doing this, he said in a post on Telegram, is that the deal is only a ceasefire agreement and not a political one.

Senior Israeli minister pushing to occupy Gaza, encourage volunta...	Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich says Israel must occupy the Gaza Strip and promote the voluntary transfer of the Palestinian Arab population out of the coastal enclave - and out of Judea and Samaria as well. By World Israel News Staff A senior Israeli government minister is pushing for the IDF to impose a lasting military occupation of the Gaza Strip, and for Israel to pursue a policy of voluntary population transfer, encouraging Palestinian Arabs to leave the Gaza Strip. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) addressed a conference hosted by the Yesha Council - the umbrella organization representing Jewish towns in Judea and Samaria - Monday night, during which he argued that Israel 'can and must occupy the Gaza Strip.' 'We don’t need to be scared of this word,' Smotrich continued, referring to the term 'occupation,' which has often been used by Israel's critics to refer to the Jewish state's presence in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. Smotrich expressed optimism that after inauguration day on January 20th, Israel will be able to apply sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria, and take Palestinian statehood off of the table. 'A nationalist government in Israel with Trump in the White House will be able to bring a strategic change against our enemies, changing the status of Judea and Samaria and taking the dangerous issue of Palestinian statehood off of the agenda.' The minister also called for the government to promote the 'voluntary emigration' of Gazans. 'It’s possible to create a situation in which Gaza will have less than half its current population within two years,' Smotrich said, adding that such a policy of voluntary transfer could be pursued also in Judea and Samaria. Earlier this year, Israeli media outlets reported that the Israeli government is in talks with foreign governments, including the Republic of Congo, to secure destinations willing to receive voluntary Palestinian emigres interested in leaving the Gaza Strip. 'Congo will be willing to take in migrants, and we’re in talks with others,' a senior Israeli official told Zman Israel in January.

UN dropping jurist who refuses to accuse Israel of genocide	The Wall Street Journal claims that Special Adviser's refusal to accuse Israel of genocide was unacceptable to Alice Wairimu Nderitu’s bosses. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The United Nations has decided not to renew the contract of its Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide who has refused to accuse Israel of intentionally committing mass murder. In her statements ever since the Jewish state went to war with the Hamas terror organization after its men led a surprise invasion on October 7, 2023 in which they massacred 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, Alice Wairimu Nderitu has been careful to express the need to end the fighting without pointing a culpable finger only at Israel. She harshly condemned Hamas a week after the war began, labeling its attack as 'vicious,' saying its 'continued indiscriminate rocket fire' into Israel was 'unacceptable' and appealing to the terrorists to 'immediately liberate all hostages,' while calling for both sides to cease attacking and negotiate peacefully. In a February statement reacting to the International Court of Justice ordering Israel 'to take all measures within its power' to prevent the commission of 'acts of genocide' in the Gaza Strip, which it had yet to determine were occurring, the senior Kenyan staffer said equally that 'violations of international humanitarian law can never justify the collective punishment of the people in Gaza' and that 'civilians must be protected at all times on both sides.' The Special Adviser would not 'take a position in relation to ongoing judicial proceedings before the Court,' she added. Last month, Nderitu called evenhandedly for urgent diplomatic efforts to end the 'ongoing hostilities,' 'strengthen the protection of innocent civilian populations,' and get humanitarian aid to those 'in dire need of receiving it.' She also 'reiterates her demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, for the full compliance by the parties at war with obligations under international law, as well as for accountability.' In addition, the statement said that the Special Adviser 'reiterates that her prevention mandate does not allow her to express a position on whether the crime of genocide or any other specific international crime has been committed, which can only be determined by a competent, independent and impartial court of law.' The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) argued Monday that the refusal to outright condemn Israel did not sit well with the higher-ups in the international body, such as Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Volker Turk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, who have sharply criticized Israel’s actions in fighting Hamas over the past year. It is the reason for Alice Wairimu Nderitu being told to go home after almost five years on the job, the WSJ editorial said. The Palestinians and their supporters in the UN have been accusing Israel of committing genocide against them for years, if not decades. The WSJ pointed out that Nderito’s office had put out a guidance paper in 2022 on when it is proper to call a situation 'genocide' because of 'its frequent misuse.' Rather than citing the Palestinians, she gave the examples of the Holocaust, the Hutus’ massacre of the Tutsis in Rwanda, the Serbian slaughter of Bosnian Muslims, and said it was possible that the ethnic killings then taking place in Sudan could be included as well. 'As a legal matter,' the paper opined in part, 'establishing a pattern of violence as a genocide requires demonstrating intent. Israel’s campaign of self-defense doesn’t qualify. The war against Hamas has had many deaths, but Israel’s strategy is intended to dismantle a terrorist regime, not eliminate an ethnic group.' But 'That’s not what the anti-Israel cabal at the U.N. want to hear,' it said, while accusing the body of having 'long ago lost credibility as a moral arbiter' and 'hitting a new low' in its 'assault on Israel.'

Pope Francis walks back Gaza ‘genocide’ comments	The Roman Catholic Church's top pontiff claims his call for a probe into allegations of genocide in the Gaza Strip was taken out of context, emphasizes Hamas should 'no longer exist in this world.' By World Israel News Staff Pope Francis issued a clarification Monday regarding comments he made recently on the ongoing war between Israel and the Hamas terror organization, claiming that his words had been taken out of context. Last week, the Italian daily La Stampa published excerpts from Hernán Reyes Alcaide’s new book, Hope Never Disappoints. Pilgrims Towards a Better World, including quotes from the pontiff regarding Israel's war in the Gaza Strip. 'According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,' Pope Francis was quoted as saying. 'We should investigate carefully to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.' The quotes attributed to the pope sparked an international backlash from Jewish groups, with the Coalition for Jewish Values (CJV), representing over 2,500 traditional, Orthodox rabbis, B’nai B’rith and The Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM) all denouncing Pope Francis' remarks. Following the wave of criticism, Pope Francis said during an interfaith gathering in the Vatican Monday that Alcaide had taken his comments out of context. 'I did not claim that Israel committed genocide,' the pope said. 'I was shown materials from the war, and I said that if this is true, then it needs to be investigated. I understand what is happening in Gaza. I think Hamas should no longer exist in the world, but the war should also not be prolonged.' During the interfaith meeting, formerly Guatemala's chief rabbi, Rabbi Yosef Garmon, confronted Pope Francis over his remarks. 'You cannot say that Israel must be investigated for genocide,' said Rabbi Garmon, who serves as a tank commander in the IDF. 'Look at my fellow soldiers who died from our unit.' 'They died because we entered Gaza only to search for the terrorists and to protect the innocent. Israel also protects the Palestinians and liberates them from Hamas. Any other country would bomb them from the air and eliminate this threat in one day.' 'Israel has the capability to end the war in one day and erase Gaza entirely, but it did not act that way and risked its soldiers to prevent the killing of innocents. You should investigate those who call to investigate Israel - not the other way around.'

Nighttime Hezbollah rocket attack wounds two in Nahariya	A fire was also reported in the northwestern coastal city, though it was unclear whether it was sparked by a rocket impact or interception debris. By JNS Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah launched 10 rockets at the Western Galilee overnight Monday, wounding two people in Nahariya, one of them seriously. The couple, a 70-year-old woman and 80-year-old man whose apartment suffered a direct hit, were evacuated to the city’s Galilee Medical center in serious and mild condition, respectively, according to Magen David Adom emergency medical service spokesperson Zaki Heller.

Approximately two hours later, the Israeli Air Force intercepted a drone that had crossed into the northern Golan Heights from Syria, triggering sirens in Kibbutz Merom Golan. The Monday night attacks came after Hezbollah launched over 20 rockets at the upper and western Galilee regions earlier in the day, lightly wounding a 75-year-old man in Nahariya. He was evacuated to the city’s Galilee Medical Center for further treatment, according to MDA. Meanwhile, the Israeli military’s Home Front Command on Monday evening tightened its defensive guidelines for the Golan Heights and northern border communities following a situational assessment. The new guidelines come as Israel braces for a potential escalation by Hezbollah as a ceasefire deal looms.

Brooklyn Holocaust survivors receive life-changing hearing aids	AJCF joined forces with the Jewish Community Council of Greater Coney Island and the Claims Conference to identify survivors most in need of hearing assistance. By Jewish Breaking News The gentle murmur of conversation filled Brooklyn’s Palace Hall this past week as elderly Holocaust survivors came seeking something precious – the chance to hear their grandchildren’s voices clearly again. Through a groundbreaking program by the Miracle-Ear Foundation, these Holocaust survivors are finally receiving the hearing aids that many have gone without for years. 'Sadly, 80 years after the end of the Holocaust, many of the few remaining Holocaust survivors live in poverty and cannot afford hearing aids. Hearing loss significantly impairs their quality of life, emotional and social wellbeing,' explains Jack Simony, who heads the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation (AJCF). AJCF joined forces with the Jewish Community Council of Greater Coney Island and the Claims Conference to identify survivors most in need of hearing assistance. Since 1990, the Miracle-Ear Foundation has provided over 48,000 hearing aids to those in need. The foundation’s ambitious goal is to provide 100 survivors with not just hearing aids but lifetime care and support through their Gift of Sound program. 'We are honored to work with these community partners to provide free hearing aids to restore hearing and improve the lives of these Survivors through the gift of sound,' said Jenni Hargraves, Executive Director of the Miracle-Ear Foundation. 'These hearing aids will be life-changing and allow individuals to better communicate with their families, friends and loved ones.' The timing of Miracle-Ear’s initiative carries deep meaning. As International Holocaust Remembrance Day approaches and the world marks 80 years since the Liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, clear hearing represents more than just improved communication for survivors who endured history’s darkest chapter. It restores dignity and connection to a world that once tried to silence them completely.

As Hezbollah ceasefire emerges, so does Israeli public opposition	The agreement with Lebanon is a big mistake. A historic missed opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah. I understand all the constraints and reasons, and it is still a grave mistake,' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said. By Pesach Benson, TPS A ceasefire agreement between Israel, Lebanon, and Hezbollah appears imminent, with negotiations reportedly nearing resolution and Israeli officials already gearing up for a political battle to sell it to the public on Monday. The emerging agreement is believed to include a ceasefire, Hezbollah’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon followed by the departure of Israeli troops from Lebanese territory. It is believed that the US will lead an international team to monitor the ceasefire while the Israeli military maintains the right to respond with force if Hezbollah violates the agreement. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. 'The test of any arrangement will be one – not in words or formulations, but in enforcement,' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar tweeted. 'Enforcement in two main points: 1. Preventing Hezbollah from descending south from the Litani. 2. Preventing Hezbollah from rebuilding its power and rearming in all of Lebanon.' He added, 'One thing must be clear, and in my opinion, it is clear and agreed upon by all parts of the government and all members of the government: we will not allow a return to October 6. Any violation will be addressed immediately. We will no longer agree under any circumstances to sell the future in exchange for temporary peace in the present.' Cracks in the governing coalition emerged as National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir came out against a ceasefire. 'The agreement with Lebanon is a big mistake. A historic missed opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah. I understand all the constraints and reasons, and it is still a grave mistake,' Ben-Gvir said. In the opposition, MK Benny Gantz insisted that responsibility for northern Israel’s security should not be placed in the hands of international monitors. 'We must not return to the reality of October 6. The [Israel Defense Forces] must maintain full freedom of action in the face of threats in Lebanon and continue offensive activity against Hezbollah infrastructure until a desired settlement is achieved,' said Gantz, a former military chief of staff. Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avichai Stern denounced an emerging ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, warning it could lead to 'another October 7th' in Israel’s northern region. 'I don’t understand how we went from total victory to total surrender. Why aren’t we finishing what we started?!' Stern said in a statement. 'We managed to destabilize Hezbollah, and instead of continuing to crush the organization and demolish it to dust, we’re giving it oxygen and performing resuscitation?' He also warned that the agreement would mean the city’s 22,000 residents would get back 'a destroyed city without security and without a future.' The Hostages and Missing Families Forum warned that an agreement that didn’t take the hostages into account would be a success for Hezbollah. 'An agreement without the repatriation of abductees means an explicit concession by the Israeli government on political and security levers essential for their return,' the Forum said. 'Hezbollah and Hamas are an integral part of the Iranian Axis of Evil. The October attack was launched by Hamas acting on the behalf of Iran and Hezbollah joined the war and linked its fate with Hamas while itself making a direct and explicit connection to the war in Gaza and the October massacre.' After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Special counsel moves to drop all charges in election interferenc...	U.S. District Court judge Tanya Chutkan will need to approve the request before the case is dismissed. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Special Counsel Jack Smith has asked a judge to drop all charges in his election interference case against President-elect Donald Trump, citing a Justice Department policy that sitting presidents cannot be indicted or prosecuted. 'The Department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated,' Smith wrote in a six-page filing. Trump's team—which has criticized Smith's investigations as a partisan 'weaponization' of the Justice Department aimed at undermining the former president—celebrated the motion to dismiss the case as a 'major victory for the rule of law.' 'The American People re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to Make America Great Again. Today's decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump, and is a major victory for the rule of law,' Trump communications director Steven Cheung said in a Monday statement. 'The American People and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.' U.S. District Court judge Tanya Chutkan will need to approve the request before the case is dismissed. Smith charged Trump last year with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and illegally retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump pleaded not guilty to all felony charges in that case and took the election interference battle to the Supreme Court, winning on the grounds of presidential immunity. Following the High Court's ruling, Smith filed a new indictment, to which Trump also pleaded not guilty. After Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this month, Smith signaled he would begin winding down the case against the president-elect. Smith plans to 'finish his work and resign' before Trump has the chance to remove him, individuals familiar with the special counsel's plans said. Trump in an October interview vowed to fire Smith 'within two seconds' of taking office.

US seeking to leverage Lebanon ceasefire for Gaza deal	Fifty-one of the hostages are still alive, according to the latest Israeli intelligence assessments. By JNS U.S. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Brett McGurk was scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss using a potential ceasefire in Lebanon as a stepping stone toward a similar agreement to halt hostilities in Gaza, the White House said on Monday. Deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday that the talks in Saudi Arabia will focus on a Lebanon ceasefire deal as a 'catalyst' for a ceasefire agreement with the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza that would include releasing the 101 hostages still held by terrorists in Gaza. Fifty-one of the hostages are still alive, according to the latest Israeli intelligence assessments. Ninety-seven were kidnapped in the Hamas terror invasion of the northwestern Negev on Oct. 7, 2023. Given the intense military pressure on Gaza and the harsh conditions the hostages have endured for over a year, officials fear the actual number of survivors might be even lower. The Israeli Cabinet was set to vote on a U.S.-negotiated ceasefire proposal with Lebanon on Tuesday after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved the deal 'in principle,' CNN reported Monday. John Kirby, the White House national security communications adviser, told reporters at a briefing on Monday that an agreement to end the fighting between Israel and Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah was 'close,' but not a done deal. 'We believe that the trajectory of this is going in a very positive direction,' said Kirby. 'But nothing is done until it’s all done, and it’s not done right now.'

Israel bracing for intense Hezbollah attacks ahead of ceasefire	Do not surrender to terrorism. Do not make this shameful agreement,' says northern mayor. By World Israel News Staff Israel expects Hezbollah to intensify its rocket, missile, and drone attacks ahead of a truce, which is expected to be announced in the near future. According to the New York Times, both Israel and Hezbollah have agreed to the terms of a 60-day ceasefire, after the terror group received a 'green light' from Iran to proceed with the truce. Israeli security officials have warned that Hezbollah will likely ramp up its attacks on civilian communities and military assets in Israel in the coming hours, as a final gesture before the pause in fighting. The Home Front Command tightened restrictions on gatherings in northern Israel, including shuttering schools and banning large events, in light of the likelihood of accelerated rocket and missile fire. While the terms of the ceasefire have not been officially made public, it's believed that Israel will withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon for at least 60 days. In return, Hezbollah will move its terror forces north of the Litani River. The embattled Lebanese Army - whose ability to rein in Hezbollah appears doubtful - will be responsible for ensuring that southern Lebanon is free of Hezbollah. Displaced residents of southern Lebanon will be allowed to return to their homes. However, it's unclear whether residents of northern Israel - tens of thousands of whom have been displaced for more than a year - will be able to return to their homes. Many mayors of northern municipalities slammed the expected ceasefire, saying that Israel had not yet restored security to the residents of the north nor decisively defeated Hezbollah. 'Do not surrender to terrorism. Do not make this shameful agreement. This is a sad arrangement, an agreement of surrender by the Israeli government to Hezbollah, an arm of Iran,' Metula Mayor David Azoulay told Hebrew-language outlet Channel 13. 'The threat has not been removed. We will not agree to return to the reality of October 7 in the north,' he added. Azoulay stressed that some 70 percent of the homes in Metula had been damaged by Hezbollah fire, and that reconstruction would take 'at least two years.'

Turkey stands with Palestinians until ‘liberation’ – Erdogan	Turkish president, a strong supporter of Hamas, says Turkey has no plans to restore diplomatic, trade ties with Israel./em> By World Israel News Staff Turkey will support the Palestinians until they are 'liberated' and will continue taking steps to curb 'Israeli aggression,' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. 'What Turkey is doing for Palestine, Gaza, and Lebanon is far greater than what is visible,' Erdogan said at a press conference following a cabinet meeting. 'For 14 months, a highly bloody and extremely dangerous war has been ongoing right next to Türkiye, despite some individuals' insistence on ignoring it,' he continued. Erodgan reiterated his anti-Israel stance, stating that his government 'will not continue and develop its relations with Israel,' according to a summary of his comments published by the Xinua news agency. 'We have cut trade and ties with Israel, period,' Erdogan said. Recent reports indicated that Turkey may serve as a safe haven for Hamas officials and their families, after the terror group was asked to leave its patron state of Qatar. Erdogan has hosted Hamas' senior leadership numerous times, and stressed that Turkey does not classify Hamas as a terror group. The Turkish leader has repeatedly made inflammatory remarks about the Jewish State since the onset of the October 7th war. He has accused Israel of committing 'genocide' against Gazans, called Israel a 'terrorist state,' and said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'worse than Hitler.' Earlier this week, Erdogan praised the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'We support the arrest warrant,' Erdogan said during a speech in Istanbul, urging that EU member states arrest Netanyahu and Gallant should they travel to their territories. 'We consider it important that this courageous decision be carried out by all country members of the accord to renew the trust of humanity in the international system.'

Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner to donate $1 million to the Chabad branch where Rabbi Zvi Kogan worked before his murder; Kushner's brother announces matching $1 million donation. By World Israel News Staff Former President and President-elect Donald Trump's daughter and son-in-law are donating $1 million to the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, in honor of the Israeli-Moldovan Chabad rabbi who was abducted and murdered in the United Arab Emirates last week. Last Thursday, Rabbi Zvi Kogan, 28, aide to the chief rabbi of the UAE and proprietor of a kosher shop in Abu Dhabi, was declared missing. Days later, his murdered body was found by UAE authorities. Three Uzbek nationals have been arrested in connection with the murder. On Monday, Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and former White House advisor, announced that he and his wife Ivanka Trump would donate $1 million to the Chabad branch in the UAE where Kogan had worked. 'Ivanka and I are saddened by the loss of Rabbi Kogan, who was senselessly murdered to stop the historic bridges he was building between Jews and Muslims in the UAE,' Kushner tweeted. Kushner, an architect of the 2020 Abraham Accords that began with the normalization of ties between Israel and the UAE, emphasized the symbolic importance of maintaining a Jewish presence in the Gulf state. 'The success of his work, in partnership with the bold and positive vision of the Emirati government, has been a shining light in the world and a strong counter to the history of division.' 'Before World War 2, Jews and Muslims lived together throughout the Middle East in harmony for many centuries, celebrating their shared values, and the UAE is leading us back to that time. In the UAE, people of all faiths and backgrounds thrive together in an environment of mutual understanding and respect.' 'Ivanka and I will be donating $1 million to the Chabad of UAE and will redouble our efforts to work with the Jewish community and the country’s leadership to build a resilient, vibrant Jewish community in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. We welcome others to join us in this effort.' 'The constant scapegoating of Israel and the Jewish people benefits no one, other than inept leaders who use hatred to deflect from their own shortcomings. It’s time for the world to channel its collective energy to uplift our shared goals and ambitions.' Minutes after Kushner posted his announcement, his younger brother, venture capitalist Joshua Kushner, pledged to match the $1 million donation. 'I am inspired by your and Ivanka’s leadership. Karlie and I will match your donation of 1MM. May we live in a time of peace, unity and acceptance. May Rabbi Kogan’s memory be a blessing.'

Report: Israeli government to accept 2-month ceasefire with Hezbo...	Latest version of ceasefire deal reportedly allows Israel to remain in Lebanese territory for 60 days - followed by full withdrawal, with no security buffer zone south of the Litani River. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to bring the final draft of an American proposal for a ceasefire with the Hezbollah terrorist group to a vote by Israel's security cabinet Tuesday, in the hopes of winning Coalition backing for the controversial deal. According to an Israeli official cited by The Times of Israel Monday night, approval of the ceasefire deal is already a fait accompli, due in part to pressure on Israel by the Biden administration, including threats to withhold American veto power at the United Nations Security Council. The official also hinted the U.S. may refuse to sell the 134 armored D9 military bulldozers requested by the Israeli military. 'We don’t know how long it will last,' the official said regarding the proposed ceasefire. 'It could be a month, it could be a year.' On Monday, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said the administration is 'close' to securing a deal, while emphasizing that 'nothing is done until everything is done.' Under the proposed deal, Israel would retain the right, guaranteed by a letter from the Biden administration, to both retaliate against Hezbollah in Lebanon should the terror group violate the ceasefire, and to disrupt efforts by the Iran proxy to restore its military capabilities. According to a report by Israel's Channel 12 Monday night, the deal now under consideration would include a 60-day ceasefire, during which the IDF would be allowed to remain in southern Lebanon. After the two-month truce, however, Israel would not be permitted to administered a security buffer zone in southern Lebanon, and would withdraw as the Lebanese army takes control over the southern bank of the Litani River. Beirut would be tasked with overseeing weapons sales and production in Lebanon, to ensure Hezbollah does not rearm, while an international committee, headed by the U.S. and including France would ensure compliance with the agreement. Israel will retain the right to act militarily in Lebanon - an element of the deal Israel has regarded as non-negotiable. Right-wing lawmakers have warned against halting the war in Lebanon without achieving a decisive victory against Hezbollah, while Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter, a former chief of Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency and member of the Likud, took to X/Twitter to express his misgivings regarding the proposed deal, emphasizing that he had not yet decided whether to back the plan.

Netanyahu has reportedly agreed in principle to the ceasefire deal and is now mulling how to present the decision to the Israeli public. By World Israel News Staff According to Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, US President Joe Biden and French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron are expected to announce a joint 60-day ceasefire in Lebanon. Netanyahu has reportedly agreed in principle to the ceasefire deal and is now mulling how to present the decision to the Israeli public. Israel requested that France not be granted a role in the monitoring of the agreement, given the country's position on the ICC arrest warrants issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. However, since the Lebanese side insisted on France's involvement, a compromise was reached in which the US would enforce the agreement and France would have a lesser role in monitoring its enforcement. Israel's security cabinet is expected to meet to discuss the details of the agreement between Israel and Lebanon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held several meetings with senior officials on Sunday, and, according to reports, he tentatively agreed to the ceasefire proposal put forward last week by US special envoy to the Middle East, Amos Hochstein. Although the ceasefire deal is not yet finalized, with some unresolved issues, it is expected to include three key provisions and be implemented in three phases. Under the American proposal, which was detailed in reports last week, Hezbollah would be required to withdraw its forces from the Israeli border and north of the Litani River. The group would also be obligated to disarm, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Additionally, a U.S.-led committee would be tasked with monitoring compliance with the ceasefire. Lastly, Israel would retain the right to take military action in Lebanon in response to violations of the ceasefire, but only after the committee has exhausted all efforts to restore peace. The agreement would unfold in three stages: In the first stage, a ceasefire would take effect, during which Hezbollah would withdraw from the southern bank of the Litani River. In the second stage, Israeli forces would pull back from Lebanese territory. Finally, in the third stage, Israel and Lebanon would enter negotiations over disputed border areas.

Gallant to meet Biden admin officials in first trip abroad since ...	U.S. President Joe Biden has denounced the ICC’s Nov. 21 decision to issue arrest warrants for the two Israeli leaders as 'outrageous.' By JNS Former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is scheduled to fly to the United States on Dec. 1 for talks with the Biden administration, in his first foreign trip since the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for him and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Likud lawmaker will travel on a scheduled El Al flight, risking an emergency landing in one of the 123 countries that recognize the jurisdiction of the court in The Hague and are legally obligated to execute any arrest warrant it issues. Gallant was slated to meet his American counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, early last month to discuss 'ongoing Middle East security developments,' but Netanyahu postponed the trip at the last minute. Netanyahu announced Gallant’s firing less than four weeks later, saying it was prompted by disagreements on how to conduct the war against Hamas, Hezbollah and other Iranian terrorist proxies in the region. During the nixed Oct. 9 visit, Gallant was supposed to coordinate with senior U.S. officials, including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. U.S. President Joe Biden has denounced the ICC’s Nov. 21 decision to issue arrest warrants for the two Israeli leaders as 'outrageous.' 'Let me be clear once again: Whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence—none—between Israel and Hamas,' said Biden, adding, 'We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.' The United States is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the ICC in 2002, and does not recognize its authority. Israel also rejects the court’s jurisdiction, but in a legalistic sleight of hand, it has claimed jurisdiction by accepting 'Palestine' as a signatory, even though no such state is recognized under international law. On Friday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán invited Netanyahu to visit Budapest, dismissing the ICC arrest warrant as an 'outrageously brazen' and 'cynical' political act disguised as a judicial one. Hungary is one of Israel’s staunchest allies in the European Union and has blocked on several occasions E.U. initiatives to isolate or punish the Jewish state by preventing the consensus required for some such moves. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Monday that his country will detain Netanyahu and Gallant if they step foot on British soil.

These four Democratic firms raked in $600 million running ads for...	Seventy percent of the campaign's known total spending flowed through these four firms. By Andrew Kerr, The Washington Free Beacon Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign directed nearly $600 million to just four media consulting firms with deep ties to the Democratic establishment, Federal Election Commission records show. The latest available FEC data show the Harris campaign exceeded $880 million in total spending as of October 16, though that number is expected to balloon to $1.5 billion after the Harris campaign files its post-election FEC report on December 5. Seventy percent of the campaign's known total spending flowed through four firms: Media Buying & Analytics, Gambit Strategies, Bully Pulpit Interactive, and Dupont Circle Strategies. Together, these four Democratic firms were largely responsible for distributing Harris's campaign messaging across the nation—an effort that ultimately saw Harris lose all seven swing states and the popular vote but directed huge sums of donor money the firms' way. Media Buying & Analytics A little-known Atlanta-based firm founded in May 2019, Media Buying & Analytics was the top-earning contractor for the Harris campaign, raking in an astonishing $281 million for ad production and placement services as of October 16, FEC records show. If Media Buying & Analytics had its way, its work for the Harris campaign would have been conducted entirely from the shadows. Media Buying & Analytics doesn't have a website, its business is registered to a law office in Atlanta, and the Harris campaign's checks to the company were made out to a UPS store in the city. But Federal Communications Commission filings in 2020 linked Media Buying & Analytics to Canal Partners Media, a well-connected Democratic ad agency that has worked in presidential elections dating back to 1988. Canal Partners Media CEO Bobby Kahn confirmed to Business Insider in 2020 that his company owns Media Buying & Analytics, which was formed specifically to work for President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign. It's not uncommon for consulting firms to create a subsidiary to work exclusively with a presidential campaign in order to create the appearance of a firewall between its work with the campaign and other allied political groups. Kahn is a longtime Democratic political activist who made his name running the gubernatorial campaigns of former Georgia Democratic governor Roy E. Barnes in 1998 and 2002. He was later elected chairman of the Democratic Party of Georgia. Media Buying & Analytics raked in more than $446 million from Biden's 2020 campaign, and parent company Canal Partners Media has worked with a wide range of Democratic politicians and groups, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), and Everytown for Gun Safety. Kahn's firm knows a thing or two about overseeing an exorbitant amount of cash on behalf of losing campaigns. Early this year, Canal Partners Media raked in more than $31 million running ads for Rep. David Trone's (D., Md.) failed Senate campaign. Trone made history in May for pouring a record-breaking $61.8 million of his own money into his bid, only to lose in a blowout to his primary challenger Angela Alsobrooks, who went on to win her first term in the Senate in the November election. It's unclear what Media Buying & Analytics's profit margins were on its $281 million payday from the Harris campaign payments. Canal Partners Media did not return a request for comment. Gambit Strategies Gambit Strategies came in a distant second in Harris campaign contractor payments, bringing in $122 million from the vice president's campaign for media production and placement services. Founded in 2021, Gambit Strategies was a natural fit for the Harris campaign. One of its founding partners, Megan Clasen, was a senior paid media adviser to Biden's 2020 campaign, during which she claims to have executed 'the largest digital ads program ever run by a Democratic campaign.' Prior to that, Clasen led digital advertising efforts for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Before working on the Biden campaign in 2020, Clasen led digital advertising efforts for Democratic Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker's 2018 campaign, a connection that could prove lucrative for Gambit Strategies in the near-future if Pritzker runs for president in 2028, as some political analysts predict. Gambit's other founding partner, Patrick McHugh, also has extensive experience in Democratic campaigns. McHugh led the pro-Biden Priorities USA super PAC in 2020 and before that held senior roles at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee, and several Democratic campaigns. Gambit Strategies did not return a request for comment asking what its profit margins were for its work with the Harris campaign. Bully Pulpit Interactive Founded in 2009 by veterans of former president Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, Bully Pulpit Interactive was paid just over $101 million in Harris campaign payments for media production and placement services. Bully Pulpit Interactive has become one of the most prominent Democratic communications firms since it hit the scene in 2009, growing from an 8-person crew led by Obama campaign veteran Andrew Bleeker to a global behemoth in 2024 with 250 employees and operations in the United States and Europe. Bully Pulpit Interactive played a critical role in shepherding Biden to the White House in 2020, establishing partnerships with social media influencers to spread his message from outside the confines of the campaign. 'We were not the biggest megaphone compared to Trump, so we had to help arm any who were,' Bleeker told the New York Times after the 2020 election. The Harris campaign tried to replicate that strategy in 2024, spending millions of dollars on social media influencers to boost her campaign with young voters, according to the New York Post. But the strategy didn't work for Harris. The vice president failed to capitalize on opportunities to engage with long-form podcast hosts while Trump made the rounds with some of the most prominent hosts on the scene, such as Joe Rogan and Theo Von. Harris ultimately lost support from young voters compared with Biden in 2020, exit polls showed. Bully Pulpit Interactive did not return a request for comment. Dupont Circle Strategies Operating from the shadows, Dupont Circle Strategies was the fourth top-earning Harris campaign contractor, earning more than $94 million for media consulting, production, and placement services. Founded in September 2023, Dupont Circle Strategies has no website and worked exclusively with the Harris campaign, according to FEC records. It's unclear who or what owns Dupont Circle Strategies. As a Delaware corporation, ownership information is shielded from the public. And though the Harris campaign cut its checks to Dupont Circle Strategies to an address in Washington, D.C., the company does not have a business license or permit to operate in the district, according to business records reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. Public records indicate, however, that Dupont Circle Strategies could share ties with Chong and Koster, a D.C.-based Democratic consulting firm also known as C Plus K. The firm claims to have pioneered the use of Facebook ads as the primary form of voter contact for winning campaigns, starting in 2012, when it managed digital strategy for Democrat Bridget Mary McCormack's campaign for chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. Chong and Koster has worked closely with the DNC since 2016, according to FEC records, and more recently, in late 2023, performed some political strategy consulting for the Harris campaign. But the Harris campaign's payments to Chong and Koster dried up in December 2023. The following month, in January 2024, Harris campaign dollars started flowing into the newly formed Dupont Circle Strategies by the millions for ad production and placement, FEC records show. And it just so happens that Chong and Koster and Dupont Circle Strategies share the same office suite in a building in downtown Washington, D.C., according to Harris campaign payment records. Dupont Circle Strategies could not be reached for comment. Chong and Koster did not return requests for comments asking about its connection to Dupont Circle Strategies.

Israel approves billions in military upgrades	The Defense Ministry will purchase five 'Reshef' ships from Israel Shipyards to replace the 'Nirit' Sa’ar 4.5-class missile ship, which will be decommissioned after four decades of service. By JNS The Israel Military Procurement Ministerial Committee on Sunday approved billions of shekels in acquisitions, including the Israeli Navy’s next-generation 'Reshef' missile ships and hundreds of new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV). According to a joint statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, Defense Ministry and Finance Ministry spokesperson, the approvals follow interim recommendations by the 'Nagel Committee,' which was established in August 2024 to examine the defense budget and force buildup. Under the agreement, the Defense Ministry will purchase five 'Reshef' ships from Israel Shipyards to replace the 'Nirit' Sa’ar 4.5-class missile ship, which will be decommissioned after four decades of service. According to the announcement, the domestic production of the new vessels will employ hundreds of workers. Additionally, hundreds of new JLTV armored combat mobility vehicles are to be supplied to the Israel Defense Forces in the coming years. The Nagel Committee was tasked with making recommendations on Israel’s defense budget and long-term defense planning in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks and the ongoing multi-front war it sparked. The approved projects will now be submitted to the Knesset’s Joint Committee for the Defense Budget. After receiving its approval, the Defense Ministry will proceed with finalizing the procurements.

Britain hints it would arrest Netanyahu if he visits UK	British Foreign Secretary David Lammy says UK ‘committed’ to ICC treaty and will adhere to its ‘obligations under international law’ if Israeli prime minister visits. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Britain’s foreign minister hinted Monday that the UK would arrested Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud) if they visited Britain, in keeping with the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court at The Hague. Foreign Secretary David Lammy (Labour) fielded questions from reporters at the G7 summit in Italy, including queries regarding how Britain would respond to calls by the ICC to arrest Netanyahu or Gallant, should either visit the United Kingdom Lammy emphasized that Britain is a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, adding that should Netanyahu or Gallant visit Britain, 'there would be a court process.' 'We are signatories to the Rome Statute; we have always been committed to our obligations under international law and international humanitarian law,' Lammy told reporters at a G7 meeting in Italy. 'Of course, if there were to be such a visit to the UK, there would be a court process, and due process would be followed in relation to those issues.' Prior to Lammy’s comments, the Keir Starmer government had refused to clearly state whether it would adhere to the ICC ruling. Last Thursday, following the ICC’s decision to issue the arrest warrants, the prime minister’s office said that it viewed the ICC as 'the primary international institution for investigating and prosecuting the most serious crimes of international concern.' Starmer’s spokesperson backed Israel’s right to defend itself and rejected attempts to draw a moral equivalency between Israel and Hamas or Hezbollah, but did not take a clear stand on enforcement of the ICC arrest warrants. 'This Government has been clear that Israel has a right to defend itself in accordance with international law,' spokesman continued. 'There is no moral equivalence between Israel, a democracy, and Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, which are terrorist organizations.' 'We remain focused on pushing for an immediate ceasefire to bring an end to the devastating violence in Gaza which is essential to protect civilians, ensure the release of hostages, and to increase humanitarian aid into Gaza.'

Suspects arrested in connection with UAE rabbi’s murder identifie...	United Arab Emirates reveals the identities of three men, all Uzbeki nationals, arrested on suspicion of abducting and murdering Rabbi Zvi Kogan. By World Israel News Staff The United Arab Emirates on Monday identified the three suspects arrested in connection with the abduction and murder of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi. On Monday, the UAE’s interior ministry cleared for publication the identities of three men, all Uzbek nationals, who were recently taken into custody on suspicion of killing 28-year-old Rabbi Zvi Kogan, an aide to the chief rabbi of the UAE and proprietor of a kosher grocery store in Abu Dhabi. The three Uzbek suspects include 28-year-old Olimpi Toirovich, Makhmudjon Abdurakhim, 28, and Azizbek Kamlovich, 33. Photographs of the three with their faces partially covered were also released. 'The Ministry of Interior announced that the competent security authorities have begun initial investigations with the three suspects arrested for committing the murder of Moldovan resident Zvi Kogan, in preparation for referring them to the Public Prosecution for further investigations,' the UAE interior ministry said. The statement by the UAE interior ministry did not mention that Rabbi Kogan also held Israeli citizenship and had served in the IDF. 'The ministry emphasized the commitment of the security authorities to swiftly take the necessary measures to uncover the details, circumstances, and motives of the incident. It highlighted the dedication of their human, professional, and technical resources, which led to the swift arrest of the perpetrators.' 'The ministry praised the vigilance and quick action of the security apparatus, ensuring the identification, pursuit, and apprehension of the suspects in a short period. It also commended their efficiency in addressing attempts to undermine the safety and stability of the UAE community.' UAE officials have not disclosed any details regarding a suspected motive for the killing, nor whether the three suspects have been linked to Iran. While some have speculated that Iran may have been responsible for the abduction and murder, Tehran denied Sunday any involvement in the plot.

Ayatollah Khamenei: Netanyahu must die	Arresting Netanyahu and Gallant is not enough,' says Iran's supreme leader, calling for death penalty against Israeli premier and former Israeli defense minister, after ICC issues arrest warrants. By World Israel News Staff Iran's supreme leader called Monday for the execution of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, arguing that the International Criminal Court's decision last Thursday to issue arrest warrants for the two was insufficient. On Monday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the 85-year-old head of state and spiritual leader of Iran, addressed a gathering of the Basij Resistance Force, a paramilitary force within Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran's Tasnim News Agency reported. During his speech, Khamenei accused Israeli leaders of 'war crimes' in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, referring to Israel's ongoing wars against the Hamas and Hezbollah terror organizations. Responding to the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants, Khamenei lamented that arresting Netanyahu and Gallant 'is not enough.' 'Netanyahu's death sentence must be issued. The death sentence of these criminal leaders should be issued.' 'The crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon, Gaza and Palestine are the opposite of what they want to create; That is, it strengthens and intensifies the resistance. This is a general rule, there is no going back.' Khamenei mocked the ongoing air campaigns against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon and Hamas terror cells in Gaza, saying such strikes did not constitute 'victory.' 'Idiots should not think that bombing homes, hospitals, and people's gatherings is a sign of their victory. No one in the world considers this a victory.' 'A zealous Palestinian and Lebanese youth of any class, when he sees whether he is on the battlefield or not, he is exposed to bombardment and the risk of death. Struggle and resistance are not left for themselves; So the criminal idiots are actually developing the resistance front by their own hands.'

Hezbollah rocket wounds one in Nahariya	On Sunday, Israel marked one of the most intense days of rocket fire from Lebanon since the start of the war. By JNS Lebanon’s Hezbollah terrorist group launched over 20 rockets at the upper and western Galilee regions on Monday morning, lightly wounding a 75-year-old man in Nahariya. He was evacuated to the city’s Galilee Medical Center for further treatment, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency medical service. Shortly after the 20-rocket barrage on the western Galilee, sirens sounded in Avivim and Kiryat Shmona in the Upper Galilee. About an hour later, alerts sounded in the Western Galilee, with the IDF reporting that one UAV, which had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli airspace, had been intercepted by the Israeli Air Force. The military clarified that sirens were activated due to the threat of falling shrapnel from the interception. document.createElement('video'); On Sunday, Israel marked one of the most intense days of rocket fire from Lebanon since the start of the war. According to Hebrew media, some 250 rockets triggered 543 sirens in central and northern Israel throughout the day, a record topped only on the day Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was killed. Eight people were wounded, property was damaged and more than a million Israelis ran for shelter throughout the day. Overnight Sunday, the Israeli Air Force struck rocket launchers from which the Haifa area and the Sharon district in central Israel were targeted, as well as 12 Hezbollah command posts in its Dahieh stronghold south of Beirut, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Hezbollah has launched some 16,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel since joining the war in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the Gaza-based terror organization’s massacre in southern Israel. More than 60,000 residents of northern Israel remain internally displaced due to the ongoing cross-border attacks from Lebanon, which to date have killed 76 people in Israel, including 31 IDF soldiers and six foreign nationals, and wounded 729 more, 66 of them seriously.

Dershowitz gathering ‘dream team’ to defend Netanyahu and Gallant...	The arrest warrant for war crimes 'disgraces the rule of international law,' the famed jurist wrote in the Wall Street Journal. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Harvard law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz is gathering a 'dream team' to defend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant from war crimes charges that will be brought against them at the International Criminal Court (ICC), he wrote Sunday in The Wall Street Journal. The case is extremely important, he noted, because 'It will also be tried in the court of public opinion, both in the U.S. and throughout the world.' He is therefore 'assembling a team of world class lawyers from around the globe to help defend Israeli leaders against the false charges.' He named over a dozen prominent attorneys who have already agreed to join him. These included former U.S. attorneys-general Michael Mukasey and William Barr, former FBI Director Louis Freeh, former Canadian minister of justice and attorney general Irwin Cotler, and Nadine Strossen, the former president of the American Civil Liberties Union. The ICC on Thursday issued arrest warrants for the two Israeli leaders and a Hamas terrorist, Muhammed Deif, who was assassinated by the IDF months ago but the court is ostensibly not convinced of his death. By doing so, Dershowitz argued, 'the court is seeking to equate the terrorism of Hamas, which murdered, raped and kidnapped approximately 1,450 Israelis, mostly civilians, with the self-defense efforts of Israel to prevent a promised recurrence of Oct. 7.' He accused the court of creating a 'double standard' for Israel’s prosecution of its war of self-defense against the terrorists, when 'the validity, integrity, legitimacy and acceptability of international law and the laws of war depend on the application of a single standard.' By issuing 'these illegal and unjustified warrants,' he wrote, the ICC has 'disgraced and destroyed' the rule of international law and 'lost its credibility.' Dershowitz applauded the announcements by Congressional leaders that they would sanction ICC personnel if they continue with their anti-Israel efforts. The arguments he said the team would use are familiar ones that Israel and its allies have already raised in attempts to head off legal action against the Jewish state by both the ICC and the International Court of Justice, whose mandate is to settle legal disputes on a state level and does not deal with individuals. These include complementarity, which means that if a country has a judicial system as Israel does, that readily and robustly investigates even political leaders, the ICC cannot try the case itself. They will also delve into hard statistics that have seemingly been ignored in the court’s zeal to prosecute. Dershowitz wrote of the fact that the IDF’s kill ratio between combatants and noncombatants in Gaza is 'lower than in any comparable war anywhere in the world.' This makes a mockery of the charge that Israel is attempting to commit genocide 'or any other war crime.' The team will also present as an argument the enormous amount of humanitarian aid – 700,000 tons of food and medicine, according to government sources – that Israel has allowed into Gaza over the last year. The professor emeritus at Harvard Law School ended by inviting other like-minded legal eagles to 'join in this endeavor.'

Paranoia grips Hezbollah as hundreds of members are charged with ...	They've been targeting an international mix of suspects, including Lebanese citizens, multiple Western passport holders, and dozens of Syrian nationals. By Jewish Breaking News With Israel knocking out Hezbollah’s top leaders, paranoia has overtaken the Iranian-backed terror group, resulting in a sweeping purge that has seen more than 200 people detained on trumped-up espionage charges. According to Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar newspaper, since early September, Hezbollah’s security apparatus has unleashed a sweeping crackdown in its Beirut stronghold of Dahieh. They've been targeting an international mix of suspects, including Lebanese citizens, multiple Western passport holders, and dozens of Syrian nationals. In one notable case, authorities detained a former American law enforcement officer who was discovered touring the area with a local Lebanese contact. During interrogation, the ex-cop maintained he was simply documenting conditions in the war-affected region. Similarly, a French national who presented himself as a member of the press found himself in custody after Hezbollah uncovered what they deemed suspicious footage of Dahieh buildings on his mobile device. Hezbollah’s crackdown has fallen particularly heavily on Syrian nationals, with more than 50 detained thus far. Intelligence sources claim many of these individuals leveraged dual citizenship status to enter Beirut, allegedly using their foreign passports as cover while gathering photographic intelligence. State security maintains these suspects have documented connections to Syrian opposition forces, though no evidence has been publicly presented. Beyond espionage, Hezbollah has taken a page from Russia’s playbook by charging suspects with additional crimes like drug dealing and theft.

Israel hits 12 Hezbollah command centers in Beirut	Hezbollah escalated its rocket attacks on Israel on Sunday, with some 250 rockets triggering more than 540 alarms across northern and central Israel, wounding at least eight people and damaging several structures. By Joshua Marks, JNS The Israeli Air Force struck a dozen Hezbollah command centers in the Iranian terror proxy’s stronghold in Dahieh south of Beirut on Sunday night, according to the military. Targets included operations hubs of Hezbollah’s intelligence unit, coast-to-sea missile unit and Unit 4400, which is responsible for the terrorist group’s weapons smuggling into Lebanon from Iran via Syria. 'These command centers had been used by Hezbollah to plan, command, and execute terrorist attacks against the State of Israel and to monitor terrorist activity against IDF troops operating in southern Lebanon,' the Israel Defense Forces said. 12 Hezbollah command centers were struck by the IAF in Dahieh, Beirut, including sites used by Hezbollah's Intelligence Unit, coast-to-sea missile unit, and Unit 4400—responsible for smuggling weapons from Iran through Syria into Lebanon.

Additionally, Israeli airstrikes struck dozens of Hezbollah positions across southern and central Lebanon, including command centers and weapons storage facilities. Escalation may continue as ceasefire deal gets closer Israeli officials predict that as ceasefire negotiations with Lebanon advance, the intensity of Hezbollah’s rocket fire will likely escalate. Sources in Jerusalem told Channel 12 News: 'We are navigating a complex situation, but it should not be assessed based solely on today’s attacks. We expected that the closer we get [to an agreement], the more launches we would face, with Hezbollah intensifying its assaults—particularly in response to our operations in Lebanon. From the beginning, we acknowledged that the negotiations would take place under fire.' A car that got directly hit by a Hezbollah rocket in Petah Tikva, central Israel. (Twitter Screenshot) Hebrew media reported Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a consultation on Sunday night with Defense Minister Israel Katz and other senior security officials to discuss the Lebanon ceasefire efforts. 'We are close to an agreement. It could happen within days; a few details remain to be finalized,' Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Herzog told Israel’s Army Radio on Monday morning. Among the remaining gaps between the sides is Jerusalem’s demand that the IDF maintain freedom of action in Lebanon should Hezbollah violate the terms of the ceasefire by rearming itself and attempting to reestablish forces south of the Litani River. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Dan Shapiro was expected to arrive in the Jewish state on Monday to meet with Katz and other senior officials. A central item on the agenda will be addressing Israeli concerns regarding immediate operational cooperation and safeguarding the military’s freedom of action. Shapiro’s visit to Israel follows that of U.S. presidential envoy Amos Hochstein last week and Gen. Erik Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), over the weekend. Negotiators are working out the framework for an international enforcement mechanism to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish itself in Southern Lebanon. Recent diplomatic efforts have aimed at minimizing situations where Israel will violate Lebanese sovereignty in response to a breach of the agreement. The goal is to empower the international monitoring mechanism as much as possible, while establishing clear criteria for when Israel can exercise its military freedom of action. Kurilla met with IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi on Saturday to discuss the proposed U.S. monitoring mechanism for Lebanese army operations. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) head Gen. Erik Kurilla meets in Israel with IDF Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Herzi Halevi, June 2024. (Credit: IDF.) Under the developing draft agreement, the Lebanese army will be required to conduct a comprehensive operation to remove weapons from villages in Southern Lebanon, with CENTCOM forces overseeing strict enforcement of this process. One unresolved issue is whether France will be involved in the oversight mechanism, according to Kan News. Beirut supports Paris participating, while Jerusalem opposes it. However, Kan reported that estimates in Israel are that a compromise will be reached on this matter. Another potential obstacle is that, according to a report in Channel 12, Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, must grant final approval for any ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel. Meanwhile, Halevi has instructed IDF General Staff directorates to continue developing and finalizing comprehensive operational plans. These plans are intended to address both the potential failure of negotiations and possible breaches of the agreement by Hezbollah—scenarios that could necessitate military action in Lebanese territory.

UAE's ambassador to the US denounces killing of Israeli-Moldovan rabbi who had served as emissary in Abu Dhabi, calling his murder a 'crime against the UAE.' By World Israel News Staff The United Arab Emirates on Sunday condemned the abduction and murder of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi last week, calling it a 'crime against the UAE.' Last Thursday, 28-year-old Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan, who served as an aide to the chief rabbi of the UAE and operated a kosher grocery shop in Abu Dhabi, was declared missing. Over the weekend, his body was found by UAE security personnel. According to a preliminary investigation, Kogan was abducted by three Uzbek nationals working on behalf of Iran before being murdered. 'Today the UAE mourns for Rabbi Zvi Kogan,' Emirati Ambassador to the United States Yousef Al-Otaiba said in a statement Sunday night. 'Our thoughts are with his family, friends and community over his senseless death. Zvi Kogan’s murder was more than a crime in the UAE - it was a crime against the UAE. It was an attack on our homeland, on our values and on our vision.' 'In the UAE, we welcome everyone. We embrace peaceful coexistence. We reject extremism and fanaticism of every kind. We honor Zvi Kogan’s memory by recommitting ourselves to these values.' 'Now, we are more determined than ever to protecting and sustaining the Emirates as a shining and enduring example of diversity, acceptance and peace.' The UAE is one of six Arab states with formal diplomatic ties to Israel, becoming the first of four countries to join the Abraham Accords with Israel in 2020. Also on Sunday, the UAE interior ministry announced that authorities had apprehended the three suspects wanted in connection with the murder of Rabbi Kogan. The ministry boasted that police had carried out the arrest 'in record time.'

El Al reports $1 billion in revenue, as foreign carriers avoid Is...	El Al raked in $1 billion in three-month period, while foreign airlines refrain from stating when they'll resume Israeli routes. By World Israel News Staff Israeli airline El Al recorded its highest-ever revenue and a major increase in its profits, as dozens of foreign airlines cancel routes to Israel, with no estimate of when they'll return. El Al recently announced that its third-quarter revenues reached $1 billion, a 44 percent increase from the same period in 2023. The carrier's net profits soared to $185 million, marking an increase of a staggering 258 percent. 'El Al has been operating in emergency mode for more than a year, and our goal is to ensure that the skies remain open between Israel and the world,' El Al CEO Dina Ben Tal Ganancia said in a media statement. 'Throughout the months of the war and especially in the current quarter, we continue to experience increased demand for El Al flights, which is significantly higher in relation to the seat capacity that the company is able to offer.' In recent months, El Al has faced serious criticism for price gouging, as the carrier is one of just a handful that continues to provide routes to and from the Jewish State during the ongoing war. Many foreign airlines have declined to state when they expect to resume their Israeli fights. Ganancia appeared to acknowledge that much of the company's record profits are due to the fact that the carrier essentially has a monopoly on flights to Israel. She stressed that El Al was pushed to the limit by the demand for flights, and urged foreign carriers to return to Israel in order to provide more options for those wishing to travel to and from the country. 'We make every operational effort to increase the supply of seats as much as possible, in order to find solutions and serve the public traveling from and to Israel, but for the moment we don’t have any substantial capacity to add additional flights and therefore everything needs to done for foreign airlines to resume their operations to Israel,' she said. 'Otherwise passenger demand will not stabilize and the problem will only get worse,' she added.

Israel signals agreement to ceasefire proposal in Lebanon	Multiple reports indicate Jerusalem has signaled its approval of an American-backed truce between Israel and Hezbollah, accepting the core provisions of the draft deal. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli government has given preliminary approval to an American-backed ceasefire proposal to end the fighting in Lebanon, multiple Hebrew-language media outlets reported overnight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held multiple meetings with senior officials Sunday, and according to reports by Ha'aretz, Yedioth Aharanoth, and Kan, has agreed in principle with the ceasefire proposal presented last week by Biden administration special envoy to the Middle East Amos Hochstein. Hochstein visited Israel last week and met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, following his trip to Beirut, where he met with Lebanese leaders, including Speaker of the Lebanese parliament Nabih Berri. A leader of the Shi'ite movement Amal, Berri has served as an interlocutor for talks between the U.S. and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist organization. Following Hochstein's visit to Lebanon last week, Hezbollah secretary-general Naim Qassem said that Hezbollah had reviewed the proposed ceasefire, issued its response to Hochstein, and that the matter was now up to Israel. Hochstein reportedly pressed top Israeli officials over the weekend, warning them that this marks the administration's final attempt to broker a ceasefire, and that a rejection by Jerusalem would end efforts by the Biden White House to bring the two sides to a deal. Netanyahu has reportedly agreed in principle to the ceasefire deal, and is now mulling how to present the decision to the Israeli public. While the ceasefire deal has yet to be finalized and some key sticking points remain, it would reportedly include three major provisions, and would be implemented in three stages. According to reports last week, under the American proposal, Hezbollah would be required to withdraw its forces away from the Israeli border and north of the Litani River, with the terrorist group also obligated to disarm, in keeping with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Secondly, a U.S.-led committee would be tasked with ensuring compliance with the ceasefire. Finally, Israel would retain the right to respond militarily in Lebanon to violations of the ceasefire, but only after the committee exhausts other avenues for restoring the peace. In the first stage of the deal, a ceasefire would be imposed during which Hezbollah would withdraw from the southern bank of the Litani River. Afterwards, Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanese territory. In the third and final stage, Israel and Lebanon would enter into talks regarding contested border areas.

Iran ‘immediately’ accelerating nuclear program to ‘punish’ IAEA	We will significantly increase our uranium enrichment capacity,' says spokesman for Iran's nuclear development program. By World Israel News Staff Iran announced that it is 'immediately' activating advanced centrifuges for uranium enrichment, as a punitive measure after an international nuclear watchdog group criticized Tehran for refusing to cooperate with an oversight program. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently passed a resolution urging Iran to be more transparent in regards to its nuclear development program, calling on the country to allow IAEA inspectors to visit and monitor its nuclear sites. That resolution sparked outrage among Iran's senior leadership, who released a statement indicating that it would ramp up nuclear development as an act of defiance against the IAEA. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran's reciprocal response to this political misuse of the [IAEA] Board of Governors was immediately put into action, and the deployment of a set of new and advanced centrifuges has begun,' Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf told Iran International. Ghalibaf described the resolution as 'anti-Iran' and 'harmful,' and claimed that it was an 'unjust' decision against Iran's 'peaceful' nuclear program. 'We will significantly increase our enrichment capacity, deploy various advanced machines, and enhance the speed of industrial research and development for each machine,' Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said in a Farsi-language TV interview. 'Our infrastructure will be strengthened, and security measures will be improved through other actions,' he added. Despite Iran's decision to ramp up its nuclear program rather than allow international inspectors at its site, some countries are still urging Tehran to return to the negotiation table, with the goal of returning to the 2015 nuclear deal. 'We note with serious concern Iran's announcement&#8230; that, instead of responding to the resolution with cooperation, it plans to respond with further expansion of its nuclear program in ways that have no credible peaceful rationale,' the United States, Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement released by the U.S. State Department. 'We expect Iran to reengage on the path of dialogue and cooperation with the agency.'

‘Murdered simply for being Jewish’: Outraged Israelis grieve murd...	According to Israeli media reports, the killers are thought to be Uzbek nationals working on behalf of Iran who fled to Turkey. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Israelis reacted with outrage and grief in reaction to the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan in the United Arab Emirates. Emirati authorities found his body on Sunday after he disappeared on Thursday. 'Antisemitism is not just a thing of the past. Hatred of Israel is a plague that is rampant around the world today,' said Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar in response to the murder. 'I mourn with sorrow and outrage the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan,' tweeted President Isaac Herzog. 'This vile antisemitic attack is a reminder of the inhumanity of the enemies of the Jewish people,' Herzog noted, adding that the murder 'will not deter us from continuing to grow flourishing communities in the UAE or anywhere – especially with the help of the dedicated commitment and work of the Chabad emissaries all over the world.' According to Israeli media reports, the killers are thought to be Uzbek nationals working on behalf of Iran who fled to Turkey. Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli blamed Iran. 'The horrific murder of Chabad emissary Zvi Kogan, may his blood be avenged, is a criminal, antisemitic terrorist act for which the terrorist state of Iran is responsible. It is our duty to overthrow this regime, the root of evil in the Middle East,' Chikli said. Dr. Yoel Guzansky, Head of the Gulf Program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), criticized the United Arab Emirates for its reluctance to refer to the event as an antisemitic terror attack or blame Iran. 'The UAE government seeks to downplay the murder of the Chabad emissary,' Guzansky said. 'They are not rushing to blame Iran due to the improving relations between the two countries.' A statement by the Emirati Foreign Ministry released on Saturday only referred to Kogan as a 'missing Moldovan citizen.' It made no reference to Kogan’s Israeli nationality, nor did it identify him as a rabbi. 'This incident damages their image and could harm tourism from Israel,' Guzansky added. Amid a major spike in attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets worldwide since Hamas’s October 7 massacres, Israel has issued travel warnings for countries across the Middle East. Israel and the UAE signed the Abraham Accords in September 2020.

Israeli police thwart large ammo transfer to Samaria terrorists	The majority of the weapons smuggled into Judea and Samaria are small arms and assault rifles, analysts said. By JNS Officers of the Israel Police’s Northern District over the weekend seized a shipment of more than 20,000 bullets intended for 'terrorist elements in Judea and Samaria,' the police announced in a statement on Sunday. Two residents of Ma’ale Iron, a local council that consists of five Arab Israeli villages near Megiddo, were arrested. The suspects, aged 22 and 35, were pulled over by officers on Friday in the area of the Megiddo Junction, located a mere minutes’ drive away from the Samaria security barrier. Both men were detained for questioning by security services. The Israel Police said, 'This massive seizure, worth hundreds of thousands of shekels, is another success of the Northern District in locating the sources of illegal arms and eliminating smuggling routes.' שוטרי היחידה המרכזית של מחוז צפון איתרו משלוח תחמושת שיועד לפי החשד לגורמי טרור ביו'ש, ובו למעלה מ-20,000 כדורים מסוגים שונים - שני חשודים נעצרו pic.twitter.com/0ymYql0qPf &mdash; משטרת ישראל (@IL_police) November 24, 2024 Iran continues to instigate terrorism in Judea and Samaria by flooding the area with weapons, The New York Times reported in April, citing American, Israeli and Iranian officials.

However, U.S. and Israeli officials said that the Islamic Republic is also smuggling in advanced weaponry, including anti-tank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades. In the first six months of 2024, Judea and Samaria saw more than 500 Arab terrorist attacks each month on average, according to data made public by Hatzalah Judea and Samaria (Rescuers Without Borders). During that period, first responders recorded 3,272 acts of terrorism in the region, including 1,868 cases of rock-throwing, 456 attacks with Molotov cocktails, 299 explosive charges and 109 shootings.

Israeli gov’t severs ties with paper over publisher’s controversi...	The controversy erupted when the paper’s publisher, Amos Schocken, described Palestinian terrorists as 'freedom fighters' while addressing a Haaretz conference in London on Oct. 27. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli government is severing ties with the Haaretz daily over the publisher’s controversial remarks about Palestinian terrorists, Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi announced on Sunday. 'We will not allow a reality in which the publisher of an official newspaper in the State of Israel will call for the imposition of sanctions against it and will support the enemies of the state in the midst of a war and will be financed by it,' Karhi said. 'We advocate a free press and freedom of expression, but also the freedom of the government to decide not to fund incitement against the State of Israel,' he added. The measure means the government will 'sever any advertising relationship with the newspaper Haaretz and calls on all its branches, ministries and bodies, as well as any government corporation or body funded by it not to have contact with the Haaretz newspaper in any form and not to publish any publications in it.' The controversy erupted when the paper’s publisher, Amos Schocken, described Palestinian terrorists as 'freedom fighters' while addressing a Haaretz conference in London on Oct. 27. 'The [Benjamin] Netanyahu government doesn’t care about imposing a cruel apartheid regime on the Palestinian population. It dismisses the costs to both sides for defending the [West Bank] settlements while fighting the Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls terrorists.' Schocken later issued a clarification, saying he should have expressed himself differently. 'As for Hamas, they are not freedom fighters,' Schocken wrote. Haaretz‘s editorial board distanced itself from the publisher’s remarks. The left-wing daily often publishes content critical of the Israeli government’s policies towards the Palestinians. The Schocken family has controlled Haaretz since 1937 when Salman Schocken, a German-Jewish publisher and businessman, acquired the newspaper. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

The LAF post in the Southern Lebanese village of Al-Amiriya on the Al-Qalila-Tyre road was severely damaged by the strike, the LAF claimed in a statement. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces issued an apology on Sunday after one Lebanese soldier was killed and 18 were wounded, some of them seriously, in an Israeli airstrike on a Lebanese Armed Forces position in Southern Lebanon. 'The incident took place in an area where fighting is ongoing against the Hezbollah terror organization,' the Israeli military confirmed in a statement in response to a query by local media. 'The IDF regrets the incident and clarifies that it is fighting in a targeted manner against the Hezbollah terror organization, and not against the Lebanese Army,' the statement continued, noting that the incident remains under investigation. The LAF post in the Southern Lebanese village of Al-Amiriya on the Al-Qalila-Tyre road was severely damaged by the strike, the LAF claimed in a statement. Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily in support of Hamas since Oct. 8, 2023, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones. The cross-border attacks from Southern Lebanon have killed 76 people in the Jewish state, including 31 IDF soldiers and six foreign nationals, and have wounded 729 more, 66 of them seriously.

‘None of them will get away’ – Netanyahu vows Israel will ‘deal’ ...	Israel's prime minister vows to 'deal with' murderers of Rabbi Zvi Kogan - as well as 'those who dispatched them,' in a veiled threat against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Sunday that Israel would bring the killers of a rabbi serving in the United Arab Emirates to justice - as well as their handlers, in a veiled threat to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. On Sunday, the Prime Minister's Office and Israel's Foreign Ministry issued a joint statement announcing that authorities in the UAE had found the body of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a 41-year-old Israeli-Moldovan dual citizen who had been serving as a Chabad emissary in Abu Dhabi, where he ran a kosher grocery store. At the weekly government meeting Sunday, Netanyahu expressed 'deep outrage' over the killing, which he described as 'an abhorrent antisemitic terrorist attack.' During the meeting, Netanyahu offered his 'heartfelt condolences to the Kogan family,' while pledging that Israel would bring the murderers to justice - along with 'those who dispatched them,' hinting at a possible reprisal against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. 'On your behalf, I also send heartfelt condolences to the Kogan family. The State of Israel will use all means, and will deal with these murderers, and those who dispatched them, to the fullest extent of the law. None of them will get away.' The prime minister also addressed claims by Hamas that a female hostage was recently killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza. Netanyahu emphasized that Israel is 'checking the information,' while adding that 'at this stage' it 'cannot be verified.' Reiterating previous statements, Netanyahu offered $5 million in cash, along with promises of safe passage, to any Gazan who frees an Israeli hostage, while vowing that any terrorists who harm hostages 'will pay the price.' 'Whoever dares to harm the lives of our hostages – will pay the price. I also said and I repeat: Whoever brings a hostage alive out of Gaza will receive $5 million; others who bring valuable information will also be compensated.' 'I appeal to the residents of Gaza: You can choose life and ensure your future and that of your families, or you can cling to death and destruction. The choice is yours; choose life.'

9 injured as Hezbollah pounds central and northern Israel	160 rockets and missiles launched at major Israeli cities in central and northern Israel, with hits reported in Petah Tikva, Kfar Blum, and Haifa. By World Israel News Staff At least nine people were injured Sunday, including one victim in serious condition, when Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon fired roughly 160 rockets and missiles at northern and central Israel during two waves of major attacks by the Iranian-backed terror group Sunday. The latest wave of rocket attacks began at just before 1:00 p.m. Sunday, with warning sirens sounded in cities and towns across central Israel including Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak, Petah Tikva, Rosh Ha'ayin, Hod HaSharon, Ramat Gan, Givat Shmuel, Elad, Kfar Qassem, Ramat HaSharon, Ra'anana, and Kfar Saba. Sirens were sounded minutes later in northern Israel, including in and around Haifa, Nahariya, Kiryat Shmona, Meron, Kfar Blum, and Maalot. Hezbollah rockets were also launched Sunday morning at towns in northern and central Israel. In total, at least nine people were injured in the rocket attacks Sunday, including a 51-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man injured in a rocket attack on the northern town of Maalot Tarshiha Sunday morning. United Hatzalah and Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency first responders were called to the scene in Maalot Tarshiha to treat the victims and evacuate them to local hospitals. The female victim was lightly wounded by shrapnel from a rocket, United Hatzalah reported, while the male victim suffered a moderate head injury while rushing to a bomb shelter. At just before 1:00 p.m., four people were injured when a rocket struck the central Israeli city of Petah Tikva. One of the victims, a 70-year-old woman, is listed in moderate condition after she suffered from smoke inhalation from the rocket impact. In addition, a 20 year old man suffered mild injuries from the blast of the rocket impact, while United Hatzalah emergency first responders Doron Shafir and Shlomo Feder treated a man and a woman in their 60s who had been wounded by shrapnel from the rocket. A man roughly 60 years of age was seriously wounded from shrapnel after a rocket struck in the northern town of Kfar Blum at approximately 2:00 p.m., while two others were injured in a rocket strike on the northern coastal city of Haifa.

Israelis urged to cancel trips to UAE, exercise caution in Thaila...	Israel's National Security Council issues new travel warnings for United Arab Emirates and Thailand, calling on Israelis to avoid the UAE if possible, and to exercise caution when traveling to Thailand. By World Israel News Staff Israel's National Security Council is calling on Israeli travelers to cancel all non-essential trips to the United Arab Emirates, and advising travelers exercise caution when visiting Thailand. The NSC issued a pair of new travel warnings over the weekend, updating the travel advisory status for Israelis visiting Thailand and the UAE. While the NSC emphasized that the updated advisory guidelines for travel to Thailand were not based on any new concrete threats, the travel warning to the UAE was issued just days after Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a 41-year-old Chabad emissary with dual Moldovan and Israeli citizenship and assistant to the chief rabbi of the UAE, was reported missing. Rabbi Kogan's remains were found by UAE security personnel over the weekend, after he was abducted and murdered by agents working on behalf of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The UAE is now ranked as a level 3 risk for Israeli travelers, the NSC said, according to which Israelis are advised to cancel non-essential trips to the UAE. 'And for those who are in the country—take extra precautions,' the advisory alert reads, including the removal of any outward signs of Jewishness or Israeli citizenship. 'Remain extra vigilant, and pay attention to your surroundings; If you are concerned that you have been exposed to a terrorist incident, inform the security forces; In major cities, or locations where demonstrations or protests are taking place, conceal anything that could identify you as Israeli or Jewish.' Regarding travel to Thailand, the NSC urged Israelis visiting the country to avoid attending large events identified with Israel, and concealing their Jewish and Israeli identity.

US senator threatens sanctions on allies over arrest warrants for...	South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham puts Canada, Britain, and other US allies on notice that cooperation with ICC in efforts to arrest Israeli leaders will lead to harsh American sanctions. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff A senior United States senator warned American allies not to cooperate with the International Criminal Court at The Hague in its effort to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud), threatening to impose sanctions on states which honor the arrest warrants. Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of two Republicans representing South Carolina, castigated the International Criminal Court Saturday over its decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant over their handling of the war against the Hamas terror organization, claiming there was sufficient evidence of violations of international law to justify their arrests. 'Israel is in a fight for its very life,' Graham told Fox News. 'The Jewish state is under siege from Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran has directly attacked Israel. And we live in an upside-down world where the prime minister of Israel and the defense minister of Israel are being prosecuted by a court in Belgium.' Graham also ripped the court on technical grounds, both for granting state standing to the Gaza Strip and for taking action against a state, Israel, which is not a party to the Rome Statue of the ICC. 'The court ruled that Gaza is a state – no, there is no Palestinian state under international law. And Israel is not a member of the International Criminal Court, and neither are we.' 'This is an antisemitic body and this court is to literally put in jail the prime minister of Israel and the defense minister for [Israel] defending itself from multiple terrorist organizations.' The senator warned American allies, including Canada and Britain, that any attempt to enforce the ICC arrest warrants would prompt the U.S. to impose sanctions which would 'crush' their economies. 'If you are going to help the ICC, as a nation, enforce their arrest warrant against Bibi and Gallant…I will put sanctions on you as a nation. You are going to have to pick either the rogue ICC versus America.' 'I’m working with Tom Cotton to have legislation passed as soon as we can to sanction any country that aides and abets the arrest of any politician in Israel.' 'To any ally: Canada, Britain, Germany, France – if you try to help the ICC, we’re gonna sanction you.' 'We should crush your economy because we’re next. Why can’t they go after Trump or any other American president under this theory?' On Thursday, Graham took to X to respond to the ICC ruling, calling the decision to issue the arrest warrants 'rogue and politically motivated.' 'I cannot emphasize enough my strong objection to what the ICC has done to the State of Israel.' 'The ICC is a rogue and politically motivated organization that is trampling on the very concept of the rule of law. I made it abundantly clear that I believe this entire process is an abuse of the Rome Statute.' 'I am confident that President Trump understands that the Court’s actions against Israel sets the foundation for the ICC to come after the United States one day. We must respond forcefully to the Court for our own good.' 'Any nation or organization that aids or abets this outrage should expect to meet firm resistance from the United States, and I look forward to working with President Trump, his team, and my colleagues in Congress to come up with a powerful response.'

Hezbollah’s war costs Israel’s north 5 billion shekels and counti...	Meanwhile, business closures and agricultural destruction have cost a crippling 4 billion shekels. By Jewish Breaking News 'Once-bustling streets in northern Israel now sit empty, farms lie fallow, and thousands of displaced families wonder if they’ll ever return home. After thirteen months of relentless attacks by Hezbollah, this formerly prosperous region has been brought to its knees – to the tune of 5 billion shekels ($1.35 billion). According to Israel’s Tax Authority, direct property damage alone has reached 1.5 billion shekels due to the thousands of missiles and rockets that have destroyed hundreds of homes, schools, and community centers across Israel’s northern frontier. Meanwhile, business closures and agricultural destruction have cost a crippling 4 billion shekels. Although Israeli communities along the Lebanese border bear the brunt of Hezbollah’s attacks, the financial bleeding has spread nationwide. A single Hezbollah missile strike in central Israel’s Hod HaSharon damaged 2,000 apartments, and another strike in northern Tel Aviv last week caused damage estimated at 50 million shekels. The government’s compensation fund is struggling to keep pace. They’ve already paid out 2 billion shekels to desperate business owners and displaced families, with another 2 billion on deck for the coming months. Iran’s October missile barrage alone triggered 2,500 claims worth 150 million shekels, including damage to an Air Force base. However, while the IDF pours billions into defending itself, the human toll of Hezbollah’s rain of missiles cuts much deeper than any balance sheet – forcing Jewish families to abandon homes their grandparents built, leaving ghost towns where vibrant communities once stood.

One in three Oct. 7 victims came to hospital in critical conditio...	The study by health policy researchers also emphasized the critical need to expand rehabilitation services in Israel. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A whopping one third of October 7 victims came to hospital in critical condition, said a study by health policy researchers revealed last week that examined the resources, or lack of them, that were exposed in Israel’s medical system following the day Hamas-led terrorists invaded the country. The study that was presented at a conference of the Israel National Institute for Health Policy Research (INIHPR) also noted that fully 70% of those rushed to hospital required at least one operation. The data showed that 630 people were hospitalized, with 90% of them bearing gunshot wounds, and 16% suffering from multiple types of injuries, including burns and blast wounds. The unprecedented number of serious casualties overwhelmed the two hospitals that were the initial intake centers on October 7, Soroka Hospital in Beer Sheva and Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon. The researchers said that their data showed that there is a critical need to upgrade infrastructure at Israeli hospitals in general, and add more operating rooms and imaging machines in particular to enable better and faster care of patients during mass casualty events. They also noted that fully half of all the injured were later transferred for rehabilitation and that the health care system must be revised and equipped to handle such numbers. 'The immense demand for rehabilitation resources in such a short timeframe necessitates rapid reorganization of existing medical facilities to accommodate the high number of patients requiring rehabilitation,' the researchers noted. There have been several reports over recent months on the response of the country’s medical system to the wounding of some 3,400 people on October 7 itself as well as the steadily climbing numbers due to the ongoing war in both the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. These included the issues covered in the study, both leveling criticism and providing recommendations for the future. For example, an August report by the Ministry of Defense stated that since October 7,2023, over 10,000 war wounded have been registered in the ministry’s Rehabilitation Division, with more than a thousand new cases coming in each month. Of them, more than a quarter are soldiers complaining of psychological issues such as anxiety and PTSD as a result of their war experiences. According to the forecast of the Rehabilitation Division, by the year 2030, 100,000 IDF disabled persons will be treated in the division, with half of them dealing with mental injuries. The ministry’s director general, Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Eyal Zamir, called these figures 'an unprecedented [struggle to] cope, on a scale we’ve never known before&#8230;. Our predictions, with an emphasis on those dealing with post-trauma, require the immediate mobilization of all state bodies and resources. The faster we react, the more wounded we will be able to return to life.' The study’s authors included Prof. Eldad Katorza, head of the Gertner Institute for Epidemiology and Health Policy Research, and Dr. Ari Lipsky, head of the emergency department at HaEmek Medical Center.

A Jewish museum in Tulsa held a funeral for remains of Holocaust ...	Thornblad said the museum was 'unable' to perform any DNA testing that might have revealed the identities of the remains, but said that they had originally come from the Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps. By Andrew Lapin, JTA For decades a museum of Jewish art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, held the remains of several unidentified Holocaust victims in its collection. But last week the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art took steps to give those remains a proper home, by burying and holding a Jewish funeral for them. 'We are committed to preserving history in a way that respects human dignity,' Sofia Thornblad, the museum’s chief curator, told local news organizations. 'This burial is a testament to our dedication to honoring the memories of Holocaust victims and educating future generations about the importance of remembrance and ethical stewardship.' The museum said the remains likely dated back to before the year 2000, when it was more common for museums to accept human remains into their collections. Shifting priorities in the museum space have led to a reexamination of such practices. The Tulsa museum also includes an extensive collection of Holocaust-era artifacts donated by Jewish Oklahomans, including refugees from Nazi Germany. Thornblad said the museum was 'unable' to perform any DNA testing that might have revealed the identities of the remains, but said that they had originally come from the Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps. (Jewish groups including Operation Benjamin have invested considerable resources as of late into identifying and reburying World War II-era Jewish remains.) The Tulsa museum isn’t the only one to have taken steps to bury remains of Holocaust victims in its collection. In 2019 the Rockland Holocaust Museum and Center for Tolerance and Education, in Rockland, New York, announced it would hold a proper Jewish funeral for the ashes of victims of the Chelmno death camp it had recently discovered in its collection. The ashes had been donated in 2006 by a Holocaust survivor who’d gathered dirt from the camp, apparently without realizing it held the ashes of others. The same year, the Imperial War Museum in London also announced it had the remains of several Jewish death camp victims in its collection and would be giving them a Jewish funeral. The remains of five adults and a child, all murdered at Auschwitz, were donated in 1997 by a private donor; the museum’s decision to bury them on English soil marked the first time that Holocaust victims had been laid to rest in the United Kingdom, according to Museums Journal. The question of what to do with human remains has vexed museums in recent years, particularly when it comes to Native American remains. Decades after passage of a law urging tribal remains to be returned to their descendants, many museums had yet to act on their own collections, according to a ProPublica investigation last year. Those present at the Tulsa funeral last Thursday, held at a Jewish cemetery, included local rabbis, an archaeologist, and local descendants of Holocaust survivors. Thornblad was among those who took turns shoveling dirt into the grave, in accordance with Jewish custom.

‘Plug and play’: COVID-19 nasal spray’s nanotech could target can...	Instead of the mRNA-based approach used by the Moderna and Pfize pharmaceutical companies, the researchers identified two key amino acid sequences in the virus’s protein, synthesized them, and encapsulated them in nanoparticles. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli and Portuguese scientists unveiled a novel COVID-19 vaccine that is not only effective against all major variants but can be administered as a nasal spray and — unlike conventional vaccines — stored at room temperature. Moreover, the nano-technology behind it could be adapted for other infectious diseases and other personalized treatments. The innovative vaccine is the brainchild of a collaboration between Prof. Ronit Satchi-Fainaro’s lab at Tel Aviv University and Prof. Helena Florindo’s team at the University of Lisbon. Published in the peer-reviewed Advanced Science journal, the scientists utilized synthesized nanoparticles to effectively target the virus without relying on traditional mRNA technology. The nano-vaccine leverages a unique 200-nanometer particle to train the immune system to combat COVID-19 variants, from Beta to Omicron, with effectiveness comparable to existing vaccines. Instead of the mRNA-based approach used by the Moderna and Pfize pharmaceutical companies, the researchers identified two key amino acid sequences in the virus’s protein, synthesized them, and encapsulated them in nanoparticles. 'Our approach was inspired by a decade of work on cancer vaccines. When COVID-19 emerged, we adapted our platform to develop a vaccine that is not only effective but also highly accessible,' said Satchi-Fainaro. The nano-vaccine offers two major advantages over existing options. First, as a nasal spray, it can be self-administered, eliminating the need for needles or trained healthcare personnel. Second, its storage and transportation requirements are minimal. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require ultra-cold storage because of the inherent instability of mRNA, the molecule at the heart of these vaccines. mRNA is a single-stranded nucleic acid that is highly fragile and susceptible to degradation by environmental factors. In contrast, the nano-vaccine can be stored as a powder at room temperature. For use, the powder is mixed with saline to create the spray. This feature was tested through the European Union’s ISIDORe feasibility program, where the vaccine powder was shipped at room temperature to France for testing. The results demonstrated efficacy on par with Pfizer’s vaccine. The nano-vaccine platform has potential beyond COVID-19. It could be adapted for other infectious diseases, personalized cancer treatments, and chronic conditions like autoimmune disorders, the researcher explained. 'Our technology is not just a solution for COVID-19; it is a platform for future vaccines,' said Prof. Satchi-Fainaro. 'This plug-and-play method allows rapid adaptation to target other infectious diseases or even cancer.'

Two wounded as Hezbollah fires salvos at northern, central Israel	Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were sent running to shelters by the attack, which occurred at approximately 7:30 a.m. By JNS A woman was injured in waves of rocket attacks by the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah targeting northern and central Israel on Sunday morning. 'MDA medics and paramedics are providing medical treatment and evacuating a 51-year-old woman in mild condition with a shrapnel injury to her lower limbs to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya,' the Magen David Adom emergency medical service said. She was wounded from a direct hit to a factory in Ma’alot that caused extensive damage during what the Israel Defense Forces said was a 30-rocket barrage at the Upper and Western Galilees, only some of which were intercepted. תיעוד מהנפילה הישירה במפעל במעלותהשימוש נעשה לפי סעיף 27א' לחוק זכויות יוצרים pic.twitter.com/G99rhWvPTw &mdash; ישראל היום (@IsraelHayomHeb) November 24, 2024 Additionally, a man around 60 years old in Ma’alot sustained moderate injuries while making his way to a shelter, according to Channel 12. Another barrage of 25 rockets was subsequently launched at the Upper Galilee, according to the IDF, with some of the projectiles intercepted and other impacts in open areas. Sirens also sounded three times in the evacuated border town of Metula during the morning hours. Earlier in the morning, the Iranian terror proxy launched six rockets at central Israel, according to the IDF. Five of the rockets were intercepted and one fell in open territory. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were sent running to shelters by the attack, which occurred at approximately 7:30 a.m. and triggered sirens in the Dan, Sharon and Menashe regions, including the seaside cities of Netanya and Herzliya north of Tel Aviv. No injuries were reported, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency rescue service. Shortly after the barrage on central Israel, red alerts were also heard in Kiryat Shmona and Margaliot near the border with Lebanon, as well as in Safed and the surrounding area. Israel’s Channel 12 news reported that two rockets had been fired at Safed, causing no injuries or damage. Shortly before the barrage on central Israel, several drones were launched from Lebanon into Israeli territory, setting off sirens in the Galilee. Two of the UAVs were intercepted, according to the IDF, which confirmed that the incident had ended. Hezbollah has launched some 16,000 rockets, missiles and drones from Lebanon at Israel since joining the war in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the Gaza-based terrorist group’s massacre in southern Israel. Over 60,000 residents of northern Israel remain internally displaced due to the ongoing rocket and drone attacks from Lebanon, which have caused widespread material damage and multiple deaths and injuries.

Missing Chabad rabbi found murdered	Abu Dhabi rabbi murdered after being abducted by pro-Iranian agents, says Israeli prime minister's office. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A Chabad rabbi serving as an emissary in Abu Dhabi has been found dead, days after he went missing, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office and Israeli Foreign Ministry announced in a joint statement Sunday morning. Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a 41-year-old dual citizen of Israel and Moldova, had been serving as an aide to Rabbi Levi Duchman, chief rabbi of the United Arab Emirates, and operated a kosher supermarket in Abu Dhabi, where he and his wife were residing. On Thursday, Rabbi Kogan went missing, leading to fears over the weekend that he had been abducted by operatives working on behalf of Iran. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) issued a statement claiming responsibility for the abduction. 'As part of the first stage of Operation 'Ensuring Truth 3,' and in fulfillment of their promise in response to Zionist aggression on Iranian lands and violations of Iranian sovereignty, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards have declared full responsibility for the abduction of the Israeli extremist Rabbi Tzvi Kogan.' Israel announced Sunday that Rabbi Kogan's body has been located by UAE authorities, stating that he had been murdered in an 'act of antisemitic terrorism.' 'The UAE intelligence and security authorities have located the body of Zvi Kogan, who has been missing since Thursday, 21 November 2024,' the Israeli Prime Minister's Office and Foreign Ministry said. 'The Israeli mission in Abu Dhabi has been in contact with the family from the start of the event and is continuing to assist it at this difficult time; his family in Israel has also been updated.' 'The murder of Zvi Kogan, of blessed memory, is an abhorrent act of antisemitic terrorism. The State of Israel will use all means and will deal with the criminals responsible for his death to the fullest extent of the law.' Initial reports indicate Rabbi Kogan was murdered after being abducted by three Uzbeki nationals working on behalf of Iran's IRGC. Israeli President Isaac Herzog eulogized Rabbi Kogan in a statement Sunday morning. 'I mourn with sorrow and outrage the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan. This vile antisemitic attack is a reminder of the inhumanity of the enemies of the Jewish people.' 'It will not deter us from continuing to grow flourishing communities in the UAE or anywhere - especially with the help of the dedicated commitment and work of the Chabad emissaries all over the world.' 'I thank the UAE authorities for their swift action, and trust they will work tirelessly to bring the perpetrators to justice. Our thoughts and condolences are with Rabbi Kogan’s wife and family. May his memory be a blessing.'

Netanyahu on leak case: ‘Shin Bet abusing suspects to punish me’	Premier says he is 'shaken' by the Shin Bet violating suspects' 'basic rights as citizens' in leak case. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Shin Bet security agency of engaging in a 'witch hunt' and the Israeli military of hiding 'critical' intelligence from him, in a fiery nine-minute-long video addressing the recent indictment filed against one of his aides. Eli Feldstein, an officer in the military reserves who worked as as an advisor to Netanyahu, reportedly brought a Hamas document to the premier's attention that had previously not been presented to the prime minister. The document, written by a mid-level Hamas member, outlined the terror organization's strategy of psychological warfare, including encouraging hostage protests in order to exacerbate divisions within Israeli society. After presenting the document to Netanyahu, Feldstein allegedly leaked its contents to a German newspaper. Several months later, he and a non-commissioned military officer, who has not been named publicly, were arrested by the Shin Bet. For more than one month, Feldstein has been held in isolation, and has been denied access to an attorney. He was recently moved to suicide watch, after a noose was said to have been discovered in his cell. Feldstein is being charged with leaking classified information in an attempt to harm state security. If convicted, he cold face a life sentence. 'This reality, in which young people are held like the worst terrorists, handcuffed for days, days in which they are prevented from accessing their lawyers, and violating their basic rights as citizens, shakes me,' Netanyahu said in the video statement, which was posted to his X account. Defending Feldstein, he described his former aide as a 'passionate Zionist and patriot,' adding that 'there is no chance in the world that he would intentionally do anything to harm state security.' Netanyahu questioned why the document regarding Hamas' strategy was never presented to him. 'Was this document supposed to be on my desk? Why didn’t it reach me? This isn’t the first time critical information hasn’t been delivered to me,' he said. The premier noted that there had been a number of high-profile leaks since the onset of the October 7th war, including those that had revealed sensitive details regarding Israel's military capabilities, but nobody was arrested or even questioned in those cases. 'It doesn’t take a genius to understand why there was no investigation into these leaks,' Netanyahu said. 'The public isn’t foolish. And now, we have a single investigation into one leak regarding a document that exposes Hamas's strategy to divide Israeli society and pressure me and the government to surrender to Hamas's will,' he added. 'The goal [of the indictment] is clear: to harm me and to harm you – the citizens of Israel who support me.'

Terror attack at Israeli embassy in Jordan, gunman killed	Attacker killed, 3 cops wounded as shooter targeted Israeli embassy in Amman. By World Israel News Staff A gunman targeting the Israeli embassy in Amman, Jordan was shot dead by security forces early Sunday morning, after he exchanged fire with police, wounding three officers. The attacker shot at the police as they engaged patrolled the Rabiah neighborhood, where the Israeli embassy is located and a frequent location for anti-Israel demonstrations. Earlier, gunshots had been heard near the embassy, causing local police to cordon off the area. It's believed that the perpetrator who fired the shots, likely aiming for the embassy, then attacked the police as they arrived to investigate. While Israel signed a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994, anti-Israel sentiment is widespread throughout the Hashemite Kingdom. Immediately following October 7th, Jordanians held numerous rallies with tens of thousands of celebrating the murderous Hamas rampage. Earlier in November, a former member of the Jordanian parliament was sentenced to 10 years in prison for smuggling weapons - presumably to terrorists for use in attacks against Israel - into Palestinian Authority-controlled territory. In October, two Jordanian terrorists wearing army uniforms infiltrated into Israel by breaching the border fence in the Dead Sea region. They opened fire in a moshav, wounding two people, before being shot dead by the community's emergency response team. In September, a Jordanian citizen killed three Israeli security guards at the Allenby Crossing, a checkpoint between Jordan and Palestinian Authority-controlled territory in Judea and Samaria. The day before the deadly attack, Jordanian Queen Rania railed against the Jewish State during a speech at a European economic conference. Accusing Israel of a 'criminal occupation' against the Palestinian people, Queen Rania claimed that the death toll in the ongoing Gaza war was indicative of Israel's inherent bias towards Palestinians. 'This devaluation of life must be called out for what it is: anti-Palestinian racism. This failure cannot stand,' she said.

EU official: Respect ICC warrants and arrest Netanyahu – or else	Borell stressed that countries which choose not to comply with the warrant could potentially face consequences. By World Israel News Staff Outgoing European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borell, a long-time critic of Israel, demanded that all EU member states act in accordance with recently-issued International Criminal Court arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'The states that signed the Rome convention are obliged to implement the decision of the court. It's not optional,' Borrell charged during a recent speech in Cyprus. Borrell appeared to be referring to statements from some European countries, including Germany, that they would not comply with the warrant and would refrain from arresting Netanyahu if he traveled to their nations. Hungarian President Victor Orban, a staunch supporter of Israel, recently invited Netanyahu to visit the country and pledged that the warrant would not be enforced on Hungary's soil. Terror group Hamas praised the decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, calling it an 'important step towards justice.' Borell stressed that countries which choose not to comply with the warrant could potentially face consequences. The EU diplomat continued to rail against the Jewish State, claiming that Israel uses claims of antisemitism to deflect legitimate criticism of its actions. 'Every time someone disagrees with the policy of one Israeli government [they are] accused of antisemitism. I have the right to criticize the decisions of the Israeli government, be it Mr. Netanyahu or someone else, without being accused of antisemitism. This is not acceptable. That's enough,' Borell said. Earlier in November, Borell urged the European Union to cut ties with Israel due to alleged human rights violations in the Gaza Strip. In March, Borell accused Israel of 'provoking famine' in the Gaza Strip, while calling the coastal enclave the world’s 'greatest open-air prison' and 'greatest open-air graveyard.'

Hamas claims female hostage killed during Gaza strike, IDF warns ...	The IDF later stated that it is 'currently assessing the information' and cannot 'confirm or deny its authenticity.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas claims that a female Israeli hostage was killed in a northern Gaza strike, the BBC reports. On Saturday, Abu Obeida Hamas's armed wing spokesman made the claim and said another female hostage was injured and in danger. He said, 'The danger still threatens the life of another female (prisoner) who was with her.' The IDF later stated that it is 'currently assessing the information' and cannot 'confirm or deny its authenticity.' 'IDF representatives are in contact with her family and providing them with any available information,' the statement continued. The IDF emphasized that Hamas employs 'psychological terror' and acts with 'cruelty.' 'The IDF urges everyone to avoid spreading rumors or publicizing comments that could cause harm to the families of the hostages,' the statement concluded. After despairing of a hostage release deal, there is some indication that Hamas may be willing to negotiate. Last week, a senior defense official reported that Hamas has given up on its demand that Israel commit to an immediate and permanent ceasefire before freeing hostages. This demand created a major impasse between Israel and Hamas during repeated hostage deal negotiations. The official indicated that Israel may be closer to reaching a hostage release agreement with Hamas than at any time in the past year. The proposal includes a 42-day pause in fighting coinciding with the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The official explained, 'There will be a price to the deal, but we are convinced that after 42 days, we'll know how to return to fighting.' Given the fact that Hamas repeatedly steals humanitarian aid, the official indicated that Israel is seeking the assistance of a private company that will be in charge of distributing the aid to Gazan civilians without Hamas's interference. He confirmed that the Palestinian Authority would not be in charge of distributing aid to Gazans at the end of the war.

House arms US Treasury with new powers to strip terror-linked cha...	The bill also includes humanitarian provisions, postponing tax filing deadlines for Americans held hostage or unlawfully detained abroad. By Jewish Breaking News The U.S. House of Representatives just handed the Treasury Department its biggest anti-terror weapon since 9/11, pushing through landmark legislation to financially strip non-profit organizations backing Hamas and other terrorist groups. The measure passed 219-184 on Thursday with strong Republican backing, creating a new category of 'terrorist supporting organizations,' defined as any entity the Treasury Secretary designates as having provided material support to a terrorist organization within the past three years. Under the bill’s framework, the Treasury must provide 'a description of such material support or resources to the extent consistent with national security and law enforcement interests.' Organizations designated as terror-supporting would have 90 days to appeal their designation. It would apply broadly across the nonprofit sector, including membership organizations, unions, and private foundations. The bill also includes humanitarian provisions, postponing tax filing deadlines for Americans held hostage or unlawfully detained abroad. 'It’s very, very simple,' said Rep. Jason Smith, the Republican chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. 'We, as members of Congress, have the duty to make sure that taxpayers are not subsidizing terrorism.' Speaking on the House floor, Smith also argued that Democrats who opposed the measure would have supported it if Vice President Kamala Harris had won the presidential election earlier this month. Supporters argue the bill provides necessary tools for protecting American taxpayers while maintaining appropriate oversight of the nonprofit sector, though various nonprofit organizations have expressed concerns about the scope of the Treasury’s newfound authority and appeal processes. 'We think this legislation is an overreach,' Jenn Holcomb, vice president of government affairs at the Council on Foundations, tells the Associated Press. 'It would allow the Secretary of the Treasury to designate a 501(c) nonprofit as a terrorist organization at their discretion. And our concern is it doesn’t have enough in there to really ensure that a nonprofit understands the reasoning that a secretary designated as such.' Political analysts also question why the bill was brought out of committee now while the Democrats still control the Senate, rather than wait until after January 20th when Republicans will hold a mandate in Congress, the White House, and the Supreme Court.

Orban invites Netanyahu to Hungary as ICC warrant divides Europea...	The Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Finland, Portugal, Slovenia, and Ireland are among the EU states that have said they would meet their ICC commitments. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday to visit Hungary but several other European nations said the Israeli premier would be detained if he set foot on their soil, following the issuing of an arrest warrant for him. The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Netanyahu, his former defense chief Yoav Gallant, and for a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu and Gallant, adamantly rejected the allegations as false, saying the ICC’s actions were politically motivated. All European Union (EU) countries are members of the court, which means they are supposed to enforce its warrants. But the diverging reactions — and the fact that EU heavyweights Germany and France have not said if they would arrest Netanyahu — highlight the major diplomatic and political challenge posed by the ICC decision, which drew swift condemnation from Israeli leaders and the White House. 'For us Europeans, this warrant exposes a real dilemma between international law, which is our law, and our foreign policy, especially for those member states that are unconditionally backing Israel,' Eurointelligence analysts wrote in a note. Assuring Netanyahu that he would face no risks if he visited Hungary, Orban branded the arrest warrants a 'brazen, cynical, and completely unacceptable decision.' Orban, who is often at odds with his EU peers, has forged warm ties with Netanyahu. 'Today I will invite Israel’s prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu, for a visit to Hungary and in that invite I will guarantee him that if he comes, the ICC ruling will have no effect in Hungary, and we will not follow its contents,' Orban said. The ICC, which does not have its own police force to carry out arrests, has only limited diplomatic means to force countries to act if they do not want to. The Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Finland, Portugal, Slovenia ,and Ireland are among EU states that have said they would meet their ICC commitments. Netanyahu will be arrested if he set foot in Ireland, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris told RTE radio. 'Yes absolutely. We support international courts and we apply their warrants,' Harris said. Cyprus, which has close ties to Israel, regards the warrants as binding in principle, a government source told Reuters. Germany Torn But Berlin declined to spell out what it would do until and unless Netanyahu planned to travel to Germany, adding that legal questions had to be clarified regarding the warrant. Germany 'is one of the biggest supporters of the ICC — this attitude is also the result of German history,' a government spokesperson said. 'At the same time, it is a consequence of German history that we share unique relations and a great responsibility with Israel,' the spokesperson added, alluding to the Nazi era. German officials said they will carefully examine the warrants and how to deal with them. 'I find it hard to imagine that we would make arrests on this basis,' government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit on Friday, pointing out that legal questions had to be clarified regarding the warrant. France was also non-committal, toning down its initial reaction, which had been to say that its response would align with ICC statutes. 'France takes note of this decision. True to its long-standing commitment to supporting international justice, it reiterates its attachment to the independent work of the Court, in accordance with the Rome Statute,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine said in a statement. Paris said on Friday the ICC decision was not a ruling but a 'formalization of an accusation.' France has been working on Lebanon ceasefire efforts and officials said cornering Netanyahu now could scupper those efforts. Non-EU Britain — also an ICC member — was similarly circumspect in its response. In the Netherlands, far-right leader Geert Wilders said he would meet his 'friend' Netanyahu in Israel soon, even though the Dutch government has said it will act on the ICC‘s arrest warrant if the Israeli leader were to visit the country. Wilders is the leader of the largest Dutch government party, but is not himself a cabinet member. The Czech Republic, which like neighboring Hungary has traditionally sided with Israel, appeared similarly conflicted. The Czech foreign ministry said Prague would respect its international legal obligations, while Prime Minister Petr Fiala described the ICC decision as 'unfortunate' and said it would undermine the court’s authority. The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, which rules Gaza, launched the ongoing war in the Middle East with its invasion of southern Israel last Oct. 7. During the onslaught, the terrorists murdered 1,200 people, wounded thousands more, and kidnapped 251 hostages while perpetrating mass sexual violence against the Israeli people. Israel responded with a military campaign aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities in neighboring Gaza.

Gaetz says he will not return to Congress after withdrawing AG bi...	Trump announced that he will instead nominate former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi (R.) for the position. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz (R.), who withdrew his nomination as President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general on Thursday, announced on Friday he will not be returning to Congress next year. 'I'm still going to be in the fight, but it's going to be from a new perch. I do not intend to join the 119th Congress,' Gaetz told podcast host Charlie Kirk in an interview. Gaetz, who was first elected to represent the Sunshine State in 2016, resigned from the House earlier this month after Trump tapped him to lead the Department of Justice. He faced pushback from Senate Republicans, however, and quickly withdrew his nomination as questions swirled around allegations that he had had sexual encounters with a minor. While the Justice Department last year closed a probe into the allegations without charging Gaetz, the House Ethics Committee was conducting its own investigation when the congressman resigned. Trump announced that he will instead nominate former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi (R.) for the position. While Gaetz, who has been one of Trump's fiercest defenders in the House, was elected this year to another term, he said he will fight for the president-elect from outside Congress. 'I'm going to be fighting for President Trump,' Gaetz said. 'I'm going to be doing whatever he asks of me, as I always have. But I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress.' It is unclear what is next for Gaetz, though some sources have speculated that he could run for governor of Florida following term-limited Republican Ron DeSantis. Gaetz added that he's 'excited' to see who fills his now-vacant seat.

Pro-Israel stalwart Ritchie Torres hints at run for New York gove...	Torres in recent days has said that there is a 'crisis of governance' in New York State and New York City. By Andrew Bernard, JNS Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), one of Israel’s staunchest defenders in Congress, hinted at a run for higher office on Friday by taking aim at New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. The Bronx Democrat said that like U.S. President Joe Biden, Hochul could be on the path to electoral defeat. 'Kathy Hochul is the new Joe Biden,' Torres wrote. 'She may be in denial about the depth of her vulnerabilities as a Democratic nominee. A Democratic incumbent who is less popular in New York than Donald Trump is in grave danger of losing to a Republican in 2026–an outcome not seen in 30 years.' 'Waiting until it’s too late gave us a Republican President in 2024 and could give us a Republican governor in 2026,' he added. 'Let’s avoid repeating history and avoid sleepwalking toward impending disaster and defeat.' Torres in recent days has said that there is a 'crisis of governance' in New York State and New York City. 'I think part of the story of the election is an indictment of misgovernance in New York state and New York City,' Torres said in an interview on Monday with Spectrum News NY1. 'With few exceptions, nowhere was there a greater swing toward Donald Trump than in New York, which was a vote of no confidence in the leadership of New York state.' U.S. President Joe Biden carried more than 60% of the vote in New York state in 2020, but in November, Trump narrowed that lead, with Harris winning just 56% of the vote to Trump’s 44%. The largest swing of any county in New York towards Trump occurred in Torres’s Bronx county, driven by the massive shift towards Republicans among Latino voters. A poll in September showed that Hochul had just a 34% job approval rating, and in 2022 she defeated then-congressman Lee Zeldin by just 6 percentage points, the worst performance by a Democrat in a statewide race in two decades. Since taking his seat in Congress in 2021, Torres, 36, has been widely lauded by the Jewish community for his vocal efforts to combat Jew-hatred and his support for Israel in the House. 'I see my freedom as a Black Latino from the Bronx as inextricably bound to the freedom of the Jewish people,' Torres told pro-Israel rally-goers after he was awarded the Jewish Federations of North America’s Courageous Leadership Award earlier this month. Though Torres has not directly criticized New York City Mayor Eric Adams by name in the way that he has called out Hochul, Torres could also make a run for Gracie Mansion in the 2025 election as Adams fights federal bribery charges. A spokesman for Torres told JNS that 'the congressman has yet to make a final decision regarding his future' as to whether he planned to announce a run for mayor or governor.

‘This is just who we are’: Trudeau says Canada would arrest Netan...	I have to say that we’re horrified, but not shocked,' said Michael Teper, a board member of the Canadian Antisemitism Education Foundation. By Dave Gordon, JNS Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, said during a press conference on Thursday that he would have Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrested if the premier arrived on Canadian soil, in line with a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. 'First of all, as Canada has always said, it’s really important that everyone abide by international law,' Trudeau said. 'This is something we’ve been calling on from the beginning of the conflict. We are one of the founding members of the International Criminal Court and International Court of Justice.' Both the ICC and the ICJ are located in The Hague, although the justice court is a body of the United Nations and the criminal court is a stand-alone body. The ICC issued warrants on Thursday for Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, the former Israeli defense minister, among others. 'We stand up for international law, and we will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts,' Trudeau added. 'This is just who we are as Canadians.' Netanyahu has called the court’s decision a 'modern Dreyfus trial,' while U.S. President Joe Biden recycled a six-month-old statement, in which he referred to the court’s decision as 'outrageous.' Leo Housakos, a Quebec senator, wrote that Trudeau’s were 'disgraceful comments' that suggested that 'Canadian authorities would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.' 'This ill-considered endorsement of the ICC’s politically motivated actions is a slap in the face to our ally and to every innocent Israeli still being held hostage,' Housakos stated. 'We stand with the people of Israel and support their right to self-defense against terrorism. The actions taken by both the ICC and Justin Trudeau should be condemned as a dangerous precedent that threatens global stability and the principles of international law.' 'I have to say that we’re horrified, but not shocked,' Michael Teper, a board member of Canadian Antisemitism Education Foundation, told JNS of Trudeau’s comments. 'The statement is sadly highly predictable and indicative of the overall attitudes of the government of Canada these days,' Teper said. 'It’s really just sad that Mr. Trudeau is taking this approach.' Earlier in the day, Anthony Housefather, Canadian special advisor on Jewish community relations and antisemitism, wrote that 'Israel was attacked by terrorists on Oct 7. The warrant issued by the ICC today against Netanyahu and Gallant claims their crimes started as early as Oct. 8. A day Israel was in shock, grief and mourning. The ICC discredits itself by its actions today.' Amir Epstein, director of Tafsik, an Israel advocacy group with affiliates in Toronto and Winnipeg, told JNS that 'the idea that Canada is aligned with Islamofascist countries that dictate what the ICC, the ICJ and the United Nations say and do is no longer surprising to anyone.' He noted that dictators are able to 'come freely into Canada,' which 'is both laughable and embarrassing at the same time.' The Abraham Global Peace Initiative in Toronto stated that it 'expresses its strongest condemnation' of the court’s 'reckless and politically motivated' action. 'The decision underscores the ICC’s troubling trend of weaponization against Israel, prepared by the Palestinian Authority and its allies since 2015,' the group said. 'The ICC’s arrest warrants dangerously distort international justice by empowering extremists, exacerbating global antisemitism and undermining peace efforts during a time of heightened tensions.'

Trump selects Florida’s Bondi as next attorney general following ...	Matt Gaetz abruptly withdrew his name from consideration by the attorney general, citing that he did not want to contribute anything extra to the transitioning team. By Jewish Breaking News Donald Trump has nominated former Florida AG Pam Bondi as the next Attorney General of the United States after Matt Gaetz withdrew from AG consideration. The president-elect wrote of the nomination: 'I am proud to announce former Attorney General of the Great State of Florida, Pam Bondi, as our next Attorney General of the United States. Pam was a prosecutor for nearly 20 years, where she was very tough on Violent Criminals, and made the streets safe for Florida Families. Then, as Florida’s first female Attorney General, she worked to stop the trafficking of deadly drugs, and reduce the tragedy of Fentanyl Overdose Deaths, which have destroyed many families across our Country. She did such an incredible job, that I asked her to serve on our Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission during my first Term — We saved many lives! For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans – Not anymore. Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again.

Israeli defense minister orders end to administrative arrests for...	Emergency security measure used to prevent terror attacks will no longer be employed against Israeli citizens living in Judea and Samaria, Defense Minister Israel Katz rules. By World Israel News Staff Israel's defense minister has ended the practice of using an emergency provision to place Israeli Jews living in Judea and Samaria under extended arrest without trial. On Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) announced that he has instructed his ministry to halt the practice of using administrative arrest or detention against Israeli citizens living in Judea and Samaria. 'In the current climate, where Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria face significant threats of Palestinian terrorism, supported by the Iranian axis of evil seeking to establish a terror front against Israel, and where international sanctions unfairly target settlers and settlement organizations, it is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such a severe step,' Katz said Friday. 'When there are suspicions of criminal activity, those responsible can and should be prosecuted. If no criminal charges can be brought, other preventive measures must be employed that do not involve administrative detention.' 'I unequivocally condemn any acts of violence against Palestinians and taking the law into one’s own hands,' Katz continued, adding: 'It is critical to allow the IDF and other security forces to combat Palestinian terrorism and violence effectively, without individuals undermining the rule of law.' Administrative detentions were first adopted by the British Mandate, as one of the emergency regulations of 1945. The emergency measures were continued on by the State of Israel following its establishment in 1948, allowing state authorities to detain individuals for up to six months at a time without a trial, indictment, or proof of wrongdoing, as a preventative measure to confront a perceived threat to national security. Such administrative orders can be issued by the Shin Bet internal security agency, the Israel Police, or Israeli courts. In Judea and Samaria, the orders are issued under the authority of the Defense Ministry, which administers those parts of Judea and Samaria which are under Israeli control. According to Katz's office, the minister met with Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar earlier this week, advising him of the policy change and asking Bar to 'put alternative tools in place.' Administrative arrest is used frequently against Palestinian Arabs suspected of plotting terrorist attacks against Israelis, but has also been employed occasionally against Israeli Jews, including residents of Judea and Samaria.

Israel Aerospace Industries reports most profitable year in its h...	The growth was driven by IAI’s Missile and Space Systems Division, with $1.87 billion in sales for the first nine months of 2024, up from $1.63 billion in 2023. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel Aerospace Industries reported a record-breaking order backlog of approximately $25 billion and a 74% increase in net income in its third-quarter earnings report released on Thursday. 'During this time, we have achieved unprecedented milestones, not just in technological and business terms but as a testament to our commitment to excellence,' said IAI chairman Amir Peretz. Net income for the nine months ending September 30 rose sharply to $416 million, up from $239 million in the same period last year, making it the most profitable period in the state-owned company’s history. For the third quarter alone, net income increased to $122 million, a significant rise from $74 million in Q3 2023. The growth was driven by IAI’s Missile and Space Systems Division, with $1.87 billion in sales for the first nine months of 2024, up from $1.63 billion in 2023. The Arrow missile system earned global acclaim, supported by increased R&D investment of $81 million in Q3, up from $65 million. IAI also reported a record-breaking $25 billion order backlog as of September 30, 2024. This represents a $7.22 billion increase from the previous year and secures 3.5 years of operations at current sales volumes. International demand for Israel’s military technology has surged as European countries increased their defense budgets in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Israel is developing a multilayered aerial defense system that has drawn global attention. The Arrow-3 system, which is designed to intercept ballistic missiles, had its first operational success when it shot down a ballistic missile fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen in November. It is widely believed to be the first time a missile was intercepted in outer space, but Israeli officials have not confirmed this. Operating income during the nine months grew to $431 million, up from $292 million in 2023. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the nine-month period reached $646 million, a 33% increase year-over-year, while gross profit for the third quarter climbed 25% to $282 million, reflecting an 18% profit margin. The company’s sales also rose, reaching $4.39 billion for the nine-month period, a 13% increase from $3.87 billion in the previous year. Third-quarter sales alone totaled $1.54 billion, up 16% from Q3 2023. This growth was driven by increased demand across all business divisions, with particularly strong performance in the Military and Aviation groups. 'Despite a national crisis, IAI maintained supply chain continuity and expanded its global relationships. Our systems play a critical role in Israel’s defense while strengthening our international standing,' said IAI President and CEO Boaz Levy.

Houthi missile triggers alarms in Judea	In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv, in response to which Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port in a major aerial attack. By JNS A ballistic missile fired at Israel by Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists in Yemen activated air-raid sirens in the Gush Etzion region of Judea and the Dead Sea area on Thursday night, the Israel Defense Forces said. 'Following the sirens that sounded in the areas of Judea and the Dead Sea, one launch that was approaching from Yemen towards Israeli territory was intercepted by the Israeli Air Force prior to crossing into Israeli territory,' the military confirmed in a statement on social media. Alerts were activated in the Gush Etzion communities of Tekoa, Pnei Kedem, Nokdim, Ma’ale Rehav’am, Ma’aleh Amos, Metzad and Kfar Eldad, as well as in Ein Gedi and Mitzpe Shalem near the Dead Sea, sending thousands of Israeli civilians running for bomb shelters. On Nov. 11, a Houthi missile triggered sirens across the Judean Foothills and the Lachish region, including in Beit Shemesh, Adora, Tzora, Beit Guvrin, Sarigim, Karmei Tzur, Kfar Etzion and Kiryat Arba. The missile was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, according to the IDF. Yemen’s Houthi militia has launched numerous attacks on the Jewish state in support of Hamas in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv, in response to which Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port in a major aerial attack. On Sept. 29, the Israeli Air Force carried out dozens of strikes in the area of Hodeidah. Jerusalem said the targets included 'power plants and a seaport, which were used by the Houthis to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil.'

‘Outrageous’ – Biden blasts ICC arrest warrants for Israeli leade...	Biden administration 'fundamentally rejects' ICC's decision to push for arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling the move 'outrageous' and 'troubling.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden on Thursday condemned the International Criminal Court at The Hague's decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials, calling the move 'outrageous.' On Thursday, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and slain Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, writing that there were 'reasonable grounds' to believe the three had violated international law during the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel. In a statement issued by the White House Thursday evening, Biden rejected the attempt to draw equivalency between Israel and Hamas. 'The ICC issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous. Let me be clear once again: whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.' The White House National Security Council also issued a statement condemning the ICC decision, calling it 'troubling.' 'The United States fundamentally rejects the Court’s decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials,' a NSC spokesperson said Thursday. 'We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.' Republican lawmakers also castigated the ICC's decision, with congressional Republican leaders pushing for sanctions against the court. 'The ICC’s decision to target America’s ally, Israel, is antisemitic, reprehensible, and completely ridiculous,' House Speaker Mike Johnson tweeted. 'It has absolutely no jurisdiction over Israel or the United States, and these illegitimate warrants are an attack on the very concepts of sovereignty and due process.' Johnson noted that the lower chamber of Congress voted earlier this year to impose sanctions on the ICC, and urged Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to put the bill to a vote.

Trump mulling sanctions on ICC judges over Netanyahu arrest warra...	The president-elect is reportedly preparing a list of possible sanctions for the International Criminal Court, including personal measures targeting chief prosecutor Karim Khan and ICC judges, after the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The incoming Trump administration is drafting a list of possible measures to take against the International Criminal Court at The Hague in response to the court's decision Thursday to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Israel's public broadcaster Kan reported Friday. U.S. sources cited in the Kan report said the president-elect and his advisers are currently mulling possible sanctions against the International Criminal Court, including punitive actions targeting not only ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, but also the ICC judges who signed off on the arrest warrants. 'The possibility is of imposing personal sanctions not only on the prosecutor or the court - but also on the judges themselves who issued the order,' one source was quoted as saying. Trump's National Security Advisor-designate Michael Waltz, who currently represents Florida's 6th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives, castigated the ICC's decision Thursday as 'antisemitic.' 'The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,' Waltz tweeted. 'Israel has lawfully defended its people & borders from genocidal terrorists. You can expect a strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC & UN come January.' Congressional Republican leaders also condemned the ICC for issuing the arrest warrants, pledging to move forward with legislation sanctioning the court. 'The ICC’s decision to target America’s ally, Israel, is antisemitic, reprehensible, and completely ridiculous,' House Speaker Mike Johnson tweeted. 'It has absolutely no jurisdiction over Israel or the United States, and these illegitimate warrants are an attack on the very concepts of sovereignty and due process.' 'The U.S. Senate should vote immediately on the bipartisan Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act, and President Biden should take clear steps to prevent these warrants from being enforced. If Senator Schumer and President Biden do not act now, they will most assuredly invite future lawfare against Israel and the United States. We cannot afford to show weakness.'

UNRWA official met with Palestinian terror groups secretly, decla...	The former commissioner emphasized a 'spirit of partnership' and said UNRWA's decisions could be challenged or even reversed at the terror group representatives' requests. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A former UNRWA commissioner met with Palestinian terror groups secretly in Lebanon in 2017 and told them, 'No one can separate us' and 'We are one,' UN Watch reports. Former UNRWA commissioner general Pierre Krahenbuhl held a meeting in Beirut in February 2017, and attending were Chief in Lebanon Hakam Shawan, Ali Baraka from Hamas, Abu Imad Al-Rifai from the Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Salah Al-Youssef from the PFLP and representatives from other Palestinian terror groups. Hamas official Ali Baraka had close ties with terrorist entities in Syria and Iran and was listed by the US as a wanted terrorist. Abu Imad al-Rifai, a Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader, bragged about organizing suicide bombings targeting US and British military personnel. Krahenbuhl was apparently aware that the meetings were problematic because he insisted on secrecy and warned exposure could 'lead to a loss between donor countries and UNRWA, which might result in reduced or even halted funding.' The former commissioner emphasized a 'spirit of partnership' and said UNRWA's decisions could be challenged or even reversed at the terror group representatives' request. Krahenbuhl said they had the opportunity to meet with him 'a thousand times' to discuss their concerns or objections to policies and could reverse them. He said, 'Your cooperation with us in security matters and your commitment to not closing UNRWA institutions, facilities, schools, or offices also completes this partnership. If we can achieve this, it means we are united, and no one can separate us.' These documents exposed by UNWatch give insight into how UNRWA established close ties with terror groups to the extent that Hamas embedded its terror infrastructures inside UNRWA buildings and schools, with many UNRWA teachers also involved in acts of terrorism. UNRWA was met with scrutiny last year when it came to light that a number of UNRWA workers were actively involved in the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7th.

Netanyahu calls ICC arrest warrant a ‘modern Dreyfus trial’	The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Netanyahu, Gallant, and a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. By Algemeiner Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday lambasted the International Criminal Court’s decision to issue arrest warrants for him and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, calling the ruling 'antisemitic' and the charges on which it was based false. 'Israel utterly rejects the false and absurd charges of the International Criminal Court [ICC], a biased and discriminatory political body,' Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. 'No war is more just than the war Israel has been waging in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, when the Hamas terrorist organization launched a murderous assault and perpetrated the largest massacre against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.' The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Netanyahu, Gallant, and a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. The war began last Oct. 7, when the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, which rules Gaza, invaded neighboring southern Israel and perpetrated a bloody massacre that killed 1,200 people and wounded thousands more. During the onslaught, the terrorists perpetrated mass sexual violence and kidnapped over 250 hostages. Israel responded with a military campaign aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities in Gaza. However, the ICC said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for starvation in Gaza and the persecution of Palestinians — charges vehemently denied by Israel, which has provided significant humanitarian aid into the war-torn enclave throughout the war. The statement from Netanyahu’s office noted that the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, initially made his surprise demand for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on the same day in May that he suddenly canceled a long-planned visit to both Gaza and Israel to collect evidence of alleged war crimes. The last-second cancellation infuriated US and British leaders, according to Reuters, which reported that the trip would have offered Israeli leaders a first opportunity to present their position and outline any action they were taking to respond to the war crime allegations. 'The antisemitic decision of the International Criminal Court is a modern Dreyfus trial — and will end the same way,' the Israeli premier added. Albert Dreyfus was a French army officer falsely convicted of espionage in a landmark case that sparked antisemitic violence across France. Antisemitism has surged globally since Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre, amid the ensuing Gaza war, with countries around the world reporting record spikes in antisemitic attacks and other incidents targeting Jewish communities. Netanyahu vowed that 'no anti-Israel decision will prevent the State of Israel from defending its citizens.' In a rare show of unity, bitter political foes of Netanyahu from across the Israeli political spectrum joined him in condemning the ICC decision. 'Israel defends its life against terrorist organizations that attacked, murdered, and raped our citizens. These arrest warrants are a reward for terrorism,' said Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid. Benny Gantz, who joined Netanyahu’s war cabinet in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack but quit in June, lambasted what he called the ICC’s 'moral blindness,' calling the ruling a 'shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten.' Gallant, who Netanyahu fired as defense minister earlier this month, posted on social media that the ICC’s 'outrageous decision will live in infamy.' 'It places the State of Israel and the brutal terrorist organization Hamas in the same equation. Today’s decision legitimizes and rewards the murder, rape and kidnapping of Israeli children, women, and men,' Gallant continued. 'The State of Israel will not be deterred — long gone are the days when the nation of Israel could not defend itself. The IDF will continue fighting to achieve the goals of this war: Dismantling Hamas, ensuring the return of the hostages, and enabling Israel’s northern communities to return to their homes.' The former defense chief added that he was 'proud of the extraordinary privilege I had in leading Israel’s defense establishment during our hardest hour.' President Isaac Herzog similarly said the ICC 'chose the side of terrorism and evil over democracy and freedom and turned the international justice system itself into a human shield for Hamas’s crimes against humanity.' The ICC has 'lost all legitimacy' after issuing the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said. 'A dark moment for the International Criminal Court,' Saar posted on X, adding that it had issued 'absurd orders without authority.' Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said the ICC showed 'once again that it is antisemitic through and through.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich urged Netanyahu to sever contact with the court and impose sanctions on the Palestinian Authority and its leaders. 'Israel will continue to defend its citizens and its security with determination,' he said. There was no immediate comment from Gallant on the ICC decision. 'Israel is fighting … the most just of wars against pure evil. All Israelis, left and right, stand behind the war, whose goals are to release the kidnapped Israelis, demolish Hamas and restore security to Israel. Shame on ICC,' wrote former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a right-wing critic of Netanyahu. Amir Ohana, speaker of Israel’s parliament, known as the Knesset, and a top member of Netanyahu’s Likud Party, expressed similar sentiments: 'Targeting the democratically elected leaders of Israel, the Middle East’s only democracy and the world’s only Jewish state, is nothing short of an assault on justice, truth, and the universal right of self-defense.' The ICC has no jurisdiction over Israel as it is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the court. Other countries including the US have similarly not signed the ICC charter. However, the ICC has asserted jurisdiction by accepting 'Palestine' as a signatory in 2015, despite no such state being recognized under international law. Countries that are signatories, including several in Europe, are bound by the charter to enforce its rulings and arrest warrants.

‘You can expect a strong response’: Republicans, weeks away from ...	The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,' Rep. Michael Waltz (R., Fla.). By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon The International Criminal Court's decision to issue arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister sparked a flurry of promises from Republican leaders to sanction the court and erode its legitimacy on the world stage. The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this year that would do just that, though Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) blocked it from coming to a vote in the upper chamber. In a matter of weeks, however, Schumer will be in the minority—and Republicans will control both the House and the executive branch. Incoming GOP leaders in the House, Senate, and White House made clear that, come January, the ICC will face sanctions and other punitive measures. 'The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,' Rep. Michael Waltz (R., Fla.), President-elect Donald Trump's incoming national security adviser, said in reference to the court's determination that Netanyahu and former Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant are guilty of war crimes. 'Israel has lawfully defended its people & borders from genocidal terrorists. You can expect a strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC & UN come January.' House majority whip Tom Emmer (R., Minn.) echoed Waltz, telling the Washington Free Beacon that Republicans in the lower chamber 'will continue doing everything in our power to combat this pro-terrorist, illegitimate court.' 'House Republicans passed bipartisan legislation five months ago to sanction the ICC for unlawfully targeting our ally, yet it has done nothing but collect dust on Chuck Schumer's desk,' Emmer said. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) also took aim at Schumer. 'It is time for the U.S. Senate to act and sanction this irresponsible body,' he said. 'Now.' Following months of debate, the ICC determined that Israel has intentionally starved Palestinians in the war-torn Gaza Strip during its yearlong war to eradicate Hamas. The charges carry little legal weight, as the United States and Israel are not members of the court. It's unlikely that an ICC sanctions bill will land on President Joe Biden's desk before the octogenarian leaves office. Whether such a bill passes this year or in January, however, it will do so with bipartisan support. Sen. John Fetterman (Pa.), often the lone Democratic voice defending Israel from international persecution, categorically rejected the ICC's charges, indicating that the next Senate's Republican majority will have at least one ally in its fight against the court. 'No standing, relevance, or path,' Fetterman wrote on X. 'F—k that.' In addition to pushing for sanctions, Graham has led his own investigation into ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, who is accused of sexually harassing female colleagues. That investigation is also likely to ramp up come January. The ICC, in a bid to appear neutral, also issued arrest warrants for several Hamas leaders, including military chief Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, who cannot face charges because he was killed in July by an Israeli airstrike. Israeli leaders quickly condemned the ICC after the court announced the arrest warrants. Netanyahu's office said that 'no anti-Israel decision will stop Israel from defending its citizens.' The ICC's case is largely built upon allegations that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war. The court claimed the troves of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip is not enough to alleviate hunger among Palestinian civilians, though it did not mention that Hamas steals much of this aid. It also dismissed Israeli efforts to boost food deliveries in recent months. 'Decisions allowing or increasing humanitarian assistance into Gaza were often conditional,' the court wrote, adding that they were 'not sufficient to improve the population's access to essential goods.' Israel is also being prosecuted at a different court, the United Nations' International Court of Justice, over similar charges. The case was brought by South Africa thanks to underwriting from Iran, Qatar, and several Hamas-linked entities, the Free Beacon reported last week.

‘West Wing’ director to helm epic tale of American who built Isra...	The significance of Schwimmer’s contribution wasn’t lost on Israel’s founding father, David Ben-Gurion, who declared him 'America’s greatest gift to Israel.' By Jewish Breaking News Before Israel had an air force, it had Al Schwimmer – an American engineer who orchestrated one of the most daring covert operations in modern history, with help from an unlikely crew including Frank Sinatra and Meyer Lansky. Warner Bros. has tapped Aaron Sorkin to bring this extraordinary tale to the big screen. Behind the controls of military aircraft during World War II, Al Schwimmer cut his teeth as a flight engineer for TWA and the U.S. Air Transport Command. But it was his early experience as an aerospace engineer at Lockheed that would lay the groundwork for an operation that seems scripted for the silver screen. In 1948, while Jews were battling to establish their homeland, Schwimmer assembled a remarkable team of World War II veterans for a mission that would reshape Middle Eastern history. Schwimmer’s unlikely allies included notorious mobster Meyer Lansky, entertainment icon Frank Sinatra, and even Pee-wee Herman’s father, forming what might be the most eclectic covert team ever assembled. Together, they orchestrated the smuggling of 125 military aircraft and over 50,000 weapons to British-Mandated Palestine in a direct challenge to an American embargo at the time. The significance of Schwimmer’s contribution wasn’t lost on Israel’s founding father, David Ben-Gurion, who declared him 'America’s greatest gift to Israel.' His actions laid the groundwork for what would become one of the world’s most formidable air forces. Sorkin’s adaptation draws from David Kushner’s Business Insider article 'America’s Greatest Gift to Israel,' with Gotham Group’s Eric Robinson and Ellen Goldsmith-Vein producing. For Sorkin, who won an Oscar for 'The Social Network' and earned critical acclaim for 'The West Wing,' Schwimmer’s story continues his tradition of bringing pivotal historical moments to life on screen.

Hamas has given up demand to end the war before freeing hostages ...	The official indicated that Israel may be closer to reaching a hostage release deal with Hamas than at any time in the past year. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News According to a senior defense official, Hamas has given up on its demand that Israel commit to an immediate and permanent ceasefire before freeing hostages, Arutz Sheva reports. This demand created a major impasse between Israel and Hamas during repeated hostage deal negotiations. The official indicated that Israel may be closer to reaching a hostage release agreement with Hamas than at any time in the past year. The proposal includes a 42-day pause in fighting coinciding with the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The official explained, 'There will be a price to the deal, but we are convinced that after 42 days, we'll know how to return to fighting.' Given the fact that Hamas repeatedly steals humanitarian aid, the official indicated that Israel is seeking the assistance of a private company that will be in charge of distributing the aid to Gazan civilians without Hamas's interference. He confirmed that the Palestinian Authority would not be in charge of distributing aid to Gazans at the end of the war. The defense official also said that now was an opportune time to attack Iran's nuclear facilities and declared, 'Iran was never as exposed to an attack as it is now.' Regarding Hezbollah, he said the terror group may be ready to agree to a ceasefire deal, and areas of disagreement are being resolved. Earlier this month, Mossad Director David Barnea declared that it was unlikely that the hostages would be released through a deal negotiated between Israel and Hamas. Israel's Channel 12 reported that Barnea, who has headed up Israel's negotiating team in Doha, Qatar, met with relatives of Israeli captives still held in the Gaza Strip to update them on the efforts to secure the release of their loved ones. According to the report, Barnea attempted to lower expectations, telling the relatives that he believed that the chances of ever achieving an agreement with Hamas were low. 'What's going on with the deal at the moment?' the relative of a hostage asked Barnea recently. 'I still haven't gotten an official answer from the mediator, not to the Qatari proposal, nor to the Egyptian proposal, and therefore it pays to wait,' Barnea responded. 'At the moment, the chances for a small deal are low, Hamas is insisting on ending the war.'

Jessica Tisch, Jewish public servant, appointed as commissioner o...	Tisch will be the city’s fourth police commissioner since Adams took office in January 2022. By Luke Tress, JTA Jessica Tisch, a longtime New York City public servant, was appointed as the commissioner of the NYPD on Wednesday. Tisch, who comes from a prominent Jewish family, will become the second woman to head the city’s police department in its 179-year history. Tisch, 43, is a 12-year veteran of the largest police department in the U.S. — she was previously the NYPD’s deputy commissioner for information — and was appointed as the city’s sanitation commissioner in 2022. In that role, she prioritized fighting against the city’s rats, going viral for her pronouncements against the rodents. As police commissioner, a role she will assume on Monday, Tisch said she would work to keep New York 'safe and vibrant,' fight crime and disorder, build on the city’s counterterrorism abilities and implement police technology. 'We will do all of this with integrity as we continue to build public confidence and trust in the police,' Tisch said in a Wednesday statement. Tisch will be the city’s fourth police commissioner since Adams took office in January 2022. Announcing the appointment, Mayor Eric Adams said Tisch was 'one of the most successful managers in our administration.' Adams said, 'To ensure New Yorkers have the ability to thrive in our city, we need a strong, battle-tested leader who will continue to drive down crime and ensure New Yorkers are safe and feel safe, and I cannot think of a leader more up to the task than Commissioner Jessica Tisch.' Tisch’s father, James, is the president and co-C.E.O. of the Loews Corporation, which her family has led since the 1950s. Her mother, Merryl Tisch, is the former chair of the New York State Board of Regents and chairperson emeritus of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty. The family has a stake in the New York Giants and a hand in some of the city’s top Jewish nonprofits, and its name adorns one of the city’s hospitals and New York University’s arts school The couple’s foundation distributed $18 million in grants in 2023, mostly to the Jewish Communal Fund. In 2006, Tisch married Dan Levine, who works as a venture capitalist, in a ceremony at Central Synagogue in Manhattan that was officiated by her grandfather, Rabbi Philip Hiat, a Reform rabbi known for his interfaith work. Tisch joined the NYPD as a counterterrorism analyst in 2008, the mayor’s office said. She climbed the force’s ranks until she left to become the commissioner of the city’s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications from 2019 to 2022. She began her public service career after attending Harvard University as an undergraduate, as well as Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. 'My grandmother was incredibly supportive,' Tisch told The New Yorker. 'Everyone else was, like, ‘Really?’ The NYPD has about 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilian employees, and a budget of $5.8 billion. The department is seen as closely tied to Adams, who had a career in the NYPD before entering politics. The Adams administration has been in turmoil in recent months due to charges of corruption. Adams pleaded not guilty to bribery charges in September. The previous commissioner, Edward Caban, resigned in September after investigators confiscated his phone in a federal investigation into Adams’ associates. Caban’s lawyers said at the time that he was not the target of the investigation. The subsequent interim police commissioner, Tom Donlon, also became the subject of a federal probe.

‘A dark day for justice’: Israelis react to Netanyahu, Gallant ar...	Netanyahu and Gallant are now liable for arrest if they travel to countries that are party to the ICC. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel officials across the political spectrum reacted with anger and outrage after the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued unprecedented arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday. It is the first time warrants have been issued against leaders from a democratic country. The ICC ruling represents 'a dark day for justice and humanity,' said Israeli President Isaac Herzog. 'Taken in bad faith, the outrageous decision at the ICC has turned universal justice into a universal laughingstock. It makes a mockery of the sacrifice of all those who fight for justice – from the Allied victory over the Nazis till today,' he said. 'It ignores the plight of the 101 Israeli hostages held in brutal captivity by Hamas in Gaza. It ignores Hamas’ cynical use of its own people as human shields. It ignores the basic fact that Israel was barbarically attacked and has the duty and right to defend its people. It ignores the fact that Israel is a vibrant democracy, acting under international humanitarian law, and going to great lengths to provide for the humanitarian needs of the civilian population,' Herzog added. The unanimous ruling, signed by Judges Nicolas Guillou, Reine Adélaïde Sophie Alapini Gansou and Beti Hohler, said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant committed crimes against humanity in Gaza, including murder, persecution and using starvation as a tactic of warfare. A statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office called ICC judges 'antisemitic,' Prosecutor Karim Khan 'corrupt,' and insisted Israel would not be deterred from bringing its hostages home and eliminating Hamas as a threat. 'The decision to issue an arrest warrant against the Prime Minister was made by a corrupt chief prosecutor who is trying to save himself from sexual harassment accusations and biased judges who are motivated by antisemitic hatred of Israel,' the statement said. 'No anti-Israel decision will prevent the State of Israel from defending its citizens.' Current Defense Minister Israel Katz called warrants 'a moral disgrace that is entirely tinged with antisemitism and that degrades the international legal system to an unprecedented low. This is a shameful decision that serves the head of the snake, Iran, and its proxies.' Netanyahu and Gallant are now liable for arrest if they travel to countries that are party to the ICC. Israel is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction. The ICC charter prohibits the court from prosecuting nationals of countries with independent judiciaries. The legal action was spearheaded by the Palestinian Authority, which in 2014 was recognized by the court as a 'State,' leading Israeli officials to accuse the ICC of being politicized. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Deif. Although he was killed in an airstrike in July, Hamas never confirmed Deif’s death. Other national leaders with outstanding ICC warrants include Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, Libyan general Mahmoud al-Warfali and God’s Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Oct. 7 survivor Noa Argamani surprises fellow former hostage on h...	After Argamani knocks on the front door, the birthday girl opens it and is thrilled to see the two women surprise her By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Noa Argamani, who was abducted by Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists during their deadly rampage across southern Israel last Oct. 7, helped surprise another former hostage kidnapped during the onslaught in Israel on Monday with pastries for her 10th birthday. Argamani, 27, who was taken from the Nova music festival and rescued by IDF soldiers, and Hila Rotem Shoshani, 13, who was released in a hostage deal, together surprised Emily Hand at her home in honor of her birthday. A video from the scene that was shared on Instagram shows Argamani and Shoshani arriving at Hand’s house, carrying trays with what appear to be traditional Moroccan donuts and a birthday candle. After Argamani knocks on the front door, the birthday girl opens it and is thrilled to see the two women surprise her Emily Hand spent her 9th birthday as a hostage in Gaza. This year, on her 10th birthday, she was surprised by former hostages Noa Argamani and Hila Shoshani who came to celebrate her first birthday since being released. Here’s to many more happy birthdays, Emily pic.twitter.com/Wtn5qbZPyP — Israel ישראל (@Israel) November 20, 2024 Irish-Israeli citizen Hand was at Shoshani’s house for a sleepover when they were both taken captive by Hamas terrorists who attacked their community of Kibbutz Be’eri on Oct. 7, 2023. They were held captive for almost two months and eventually released as part of a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas on Nov. 25, 2023. Hand was one of the youngest hostages abducted by the terrorists on Oct. 7. Shoshani’s mother, Raaya, was also taken hostage by Hamas. She was released on Nov. 29 of last year as part of a temporary ceasefire deal, brokered by Qatar and the United States, between Hamas and Israel. Argamani was rescued on June 8 of this year, when Israeli soldiers raided the apartment where she was being held in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Three other hostages were also rescued during the same IDF raid.

IDF forces capture Syrian infiltrator in Golan	He reportedly did not breach the Israeli security fence in the area. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces detained a Syrian who crossed into the Jewish state’s territory in the Golan Heights on Thursday, the IDF announced. According to the Israeli military, the suspect individual 'did not stop in response to calls by soldiers, was shot in the leg and transferred to Ziv Medical Center in Safed for further treatment and investigation.' Ynet reported that the suspect crossed into the Israeli side of the Alpha Line, which marks the demilitarized zone between the two countries. He reportedly did not breach the Israeli security fence in the area. Concerns in Israel have grown in recent months over the possibility of a cross-border mass murder and kidnap attack launched by Iran-backed terrorist militias in southern Syria and targeting the Golan Heights. The military confirmed to JNS on Nov. 13 that it started work on a barrier on the Golan’s frontier with the Arab Republic 'to thwart a possible terrorist invasion and protect the security of Israel’s borders.' Earlier this month, the IDF revealed that its forces captured a pro-Iranian regime terrorist operative during a raid in Syria. The raid was carried out by members of the Egoz commando unit along with field interrogators of the Military Intelligence Directorate’s Unit 504. Ali Soleiman al-Assi, from Saida in the southern part of the country, was tasked by Iran with 'gathering intelligence on IDF troops in the border area for future terror activity of the network,' the military said.

‘Dark day for justice’ – ICC issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu...	International Criminal Court at The Hague issues warrants calling for the arrest of Israel's prime minister and its former defense minister, drawing sharp condemnation from both the Israeli government and Opposition. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff The International Criminal Court at The Hague issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, six months after ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced plans for the warrants. Marking the first time the ICC has called for the arrest of leaders of a democratic country, judges wrote that there were 'reasonable grounds to believe' that Netanyahu and Gallant had violated international law between October 8th, 2023, and May 20th, 2024, marking the period spanning the beginning of Israel's response to the October 7th invasion through the first weeks of the Rafah operation in southern Gaza. The decision immediately drew sharp condemnation from not only the Israeli government, but also from Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, a former rival of Netanyahu and critic of the Netanyahu government, as well as from Opposition leaders. 'This is a dark day for justice. A dark day for humanity,' Herzog tweeted Thursday afternoon. 'Taken in bad faith, the outrageous decision at the ICC has turned universal justice into a universal laughing stock. It makes a mockery of the sacrifice of all those who fight for justice - from the Allied victory over the Nazis till today.' 'It ignores the plight of the 101 Israeli hostages held in brutal captivity by Hamas in Gaza. It ignores Hamas’ cynical use of its own people as human shields.' 'It ignores the basic fact that Israel was barbarically attacked and has the duty and right to defend its people. It ignores the fact that Israel is a vibrant democracy, acting under international humanitarian law, and going to great lengths to provide for the humanitarian needs of the civilian population.' 'Indeed, the decision has chosen the side of terror and evil over democracy and freedom, and turned the very system of justice into a human shield for Hamas’ crimes against humanity.' 'This cynical exploitation of the international legal institutions reminds us once again of the need for true moral clarity in the face of an Iranian empire of evil that seeks to destabilize our region and the world, and destroy the very institutions of the free world.' Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called the warrants a 'mark of shame' for the ICC, saying that Israelis 'left and right, stand behind the war.' Opposition Leader Yair Lapid excoriated the ICC over the issuing of the warrants, calling them a 'reward for terrorism.' 'Israel is defending itself against terrorist organizations that attacked, murdered and raped our citizens. These arrest warrants are a reward for terrorism.' Fellow Opposition leader MK Benny Gantz condemned the ICC decision as 'moral blindness' which will 'never be forgotten.' Yair Golan, chairman of the left-wing The Democrats party also took aim at the ICC. 'This is a shameful decision of the International Court in The Hague,' Golan said. 'Israel had and will always have the right to defend itself against our enemies.' While the ICC warrants cannot be enforced so long as Netanyahu and Gallant remain in Israel, the two could face arrest if they travel to any of the 123 countries bound by the Rome Statute which established the ICC.

Massive Israeli airstrike kills 68 in Syria	Bombings hit three positions in Palmyra used by Hezbollah and other pro-Iranian groups. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A series of Israeli airstrikes in eastern Syria killed at least 68 people Wednesday a Syrian opposition group said, making it the deadliest air attack attributed to Israel in Syria in years. According to reports by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based anti-regime organization, Israeli warplanes carried out three airstrikes on positions occupied by Hezbollah terrorists and members of other pro-Iranian proxy groups Wednesday afternoon. The airstrikes targeted Hezbollah and the Nujaba militia in the city of Palmyra, in Syria's Homs district, SOHR reported, stating Thursday that the death toll from the strikes had risen to 68. All 68 reported fatalities were combatants, SOHR claimed, including 42 Syrian nationals affiliated with pro-Iranian militias, five of whom were officers working in conjunction with Hezbollah. The remaining fatalities include 4 Lebanese members of Hezbollah, and 22 other non-Syrian nationals, whom the report said were affiliated with the Nujaba Movement. Forty-three others were injured in the strikes, SOHR reported, including 7 civilians. Syria's SANA state media outlet confirmed the attacks, claiming Wednesday that 36 Syrian nationals had been killed and more than 50 others injured. 'The Zionist entity committed a horrific crime in Palmyra today, which claimed the lives of 36 citizens and injured dozens of others in the air aggression carried out by Israeli aircraft, targeting a number of residential buildings and causing material damage to the buildings and surrounding area.' Syria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in a statement to SANA Wednesday. According to Syria's defense ministry, 10 of the Syrian nationals killed in the airstrikes were soldiers in the Syrian army. The Israeli military declined to respond to reports of the airstrikes. SOHR claimed that the three airstrikes included a pair of bombings in Palmyra's Al-Jam'iya quarter, striking a weapons depot and a building used by leaders of pro-Iranian militias.

Douglas Murray, Ben Shapiro tell thousands in Jerusalem: You are ...	Several Knesset members also attended the event, including Amichai Chikli, Amihai Eliyahu, Dan Illouz, Ohad Tal, Ariel Kellner and Simcha Rothman. By David Isaac, JNS Two giants of political conservatism, Douglas Murray and Ben Shapiro, starred at Jerusalem’s International Convention Center on Tuesday night before a sold-out crowd of more than 3,000 in what might best be described as a mutual admiration society, with the crowd applauding its pro-Israel champions as they in turn voiced esteem for Israelis’ grit and fighting spirit. 'Thank you on behalf of Western civilization for fighting the fight the rest of the West should be fighting,' Shapiro told the audience at the 'Freedom of Zion' conference. He asked those with loved ones who had served in the Israel Defense Forces in the past year to stand up. Nearly all did. 'That’s unique. It’s something that doesn’t exist in the West anymore,' Shapiro said, describing it as a 'civic militarism' once common in Western societies. 'There are people here … who … put their bodies on the line defending civilization. I am merely a writer,' said Murray. 'If I give you any encouragement, you should know that the encouragement you give me is 1,000-fold.' Early reports pointed to an enormously successful event. The Jerusalem Post on Monday said that Shapiro-Murray was the hottest ticket in town, with fans 'scrambling for scalped seats,' likening it to a Taylor Swift concert. 'Trying one more time. Looking for one ticket to the Ben Shapiro/Douglas Murray event in Jerusalem Tuesday evening. Willing to pay well over face value. Please DM [direct message] me,' posted a member of Secret Jerusalem, an online community of Jerusalemites. Several Knesset members also attended the event, including Amichai Chikli, Amihai Eliyahu, Dan Illouz, Ohad Tal, Ariel Kellner and Simcha Rothman. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro speaks at the Freedom of Zion Conference at the International Convention Center in Jerusalem, Nov. 19, 2024. Photo by Yaakov Nachumi/Herut Center. Murray and Shapiro are renowned in conservative circles. Shapiro, an American Jew, is host of a daily political podcast, and founder of media company The Daily Wire. He frequently speaks on college campuses and is the author of numerous books, including, 'Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans' and 'The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great.' Murray, who is from the United Kingdom, first came to prominence with his 2017 book, 'The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam,' in which he warned that Europe could not survive mass Muslim migration and its loss of faith in its 'beliefs, traditions, and legitimacy.' An outspoken defender of Israel prior to the Hamas invasion, Murray ramped up his efforts in columns and TV appearances in its wake. While pro-Israel conservatives may have difficulty picking favorites between the two, it was clear from the audience reaction that Murray was the star of the evening, due perhaps to the fact that he is not Jewish and rushed to Gaza’s front lines at the outset of the war. 'For Israelis in general, you’ve become a symbol over the last year,' said Maj. (res.) Doron Spielman, the IDF’s English-language spokesman, during a one-on-one dialogue with Murray at the conference. Spielman noted that when he and Murray had entered the Gaza Strip a few weeks after the Oct. 7, 2023 attack, soldiers on break skipped the few hours’ sleep provided to them to stand in line to meet the journalist. 'They just wanted to get a hug from you and a picture with you to send to their family,' said Spielman. 'At what point did you decide to stand in the line of fire for the State of Israel and the Jewish people?' he asked. Murray attributed it to both intellectual and emotional reasons, suggesting a good deal of it was due to his upbringing and the values he was taught, such as distinguishing between right and wrong, admiring courage and not viewing victimhood as a virtue, an idea he said was today infecting most of the West. Murray also said he felt it was wildly unjust how Israel is treated abroad, particularly since the Hamas invasion, which cast into sharp relief how the Jewish nation is 'the only nation in the world which, when it gets attacked, then gets attacked again.' His connection to Israel has 'become personal,' he confessed. 'When I read about something terrible happening here, it affects me personally, as if it’s family.' Murray stressed that Israel must maintain its strength, noting that history shows that the most dangerous time for Jews is when they are 'prominent and weak.' He dismissed as impossible the idea that Jews could avoid prominence, keep their heads down and not stand out. There’s only 'one option,' for Israel, that is to be 'prominent and strong,' he said, to a rousing cheer from the audience. Conservative commentator Douglas Murray at the Freedom of Zion Conference at the International Convention Center in Jerusalem, Nov. 19. 2024. Photo by Yaakov Nachumi/Herut Center. Significant time was given over for audience questions. A line quickly formed along the entire length of the hall. Asked about the American Jewish vote, a majority of which still went to Democrats, a questioner wondered what could be done to break Jews of their left-wing leanings. Murray expressed optimism, saying that a shift away from the Democrats was already taking place. He noted that while living in Israel for most of the last year, he had had a chance to meet Diaspora Jewish delegations. T hey would say to him, particularly American Jews, that while they lent support to the MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, 'no one’s been there for me.' 'I started to realize the only thing I could say was, ‘Well, welcome,’ by which I meant, ‘Welcome to the real world.’ It was always going to be like that. This was never going to be reciprocated,' he said. Responding to a question about the existential threat posed to Israel by Iran, Murray suggested the goal should be regime change. History books will show that two journeys in the 20th century should never have been allowed to continue, he said. The first is the train from Zurich that started Vladimir Lenin’s journey back to Russia. The second is the plane that carried the first leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, back to Tehran. 'My hope is that whatever the Israeli military and political leadership can do, the endgame should be that the virus that has ruined Iran … is gone,' Murray said. Murray was presented with a Freedom of Zion Award at the event. 'We want you to know that we understand that you are fighting our war and that this is just a small token to remind you that we know that you are part of our battle,' said Spielman. Amiad Cohen, founder and CEO of the Herut Center for Israeli Liberty, the organizer of the event, presented the award to Murray. 'There’s no word in English that I found in the dictionary for ‘hakarat haTov,’ [‘acknowledging the good’] we’re in real debt for your support as a nation,' he said. The Herut Center, which promotes conservative ideas in Israeli public discourse, seeks to craft a conservative agenda for Israeli public affairs and introduce Israelis to the intellectual underpinnings of conservative thought, translating into Hebrew the books of famous conservative thinkers. Hebrew versions of Murray’s and Shapiro’s books were available at the conference. Cohen said that Murray and Shapiro were a natural fit for the Herut Center. 'The two are both strong conservatives who believe in peace through strength and total victory in the war. And it’s obvious that these two supporters of Israel should be recognized,' he told JNS. 'The war is not only a war for Israel, but it’s the war for the West, for the moral argument for the West,' he added, describing the Hamas attack as a litmus test separating those standing with Israel and 'the right side of history' from those on the side of Hamas and 'evil.' Murray and Shapiro are the 'right people at the right time' to bring this message before the Israeli people, Cohen said. 'That’s why I invited them. It’s totally part of the conservative movement worldwide, and Israel definitely, after the Trump victory.' In a 20-minute speech to the conference, Shapiro stressed the point that Israel’s fight is a fight for the West, depicting the Jewish state as a last bastion of values that were the foundation for Western success. Israel’s economic and military success and its high birth rate are a result of traditional Western values, which makes Israel’s success so vital for Western civilization’s continued success, he said. 'You are an outpost of Western civilization,' he said. 'This is the tip of the spear in a civilizational battle. It’s why everyone cares so much and it’s why you don’t have a choice as to whether to succeed. You have a duty to succeed … Because as you go, Western civilization goes,' he added.

Shapiro spoke of an Israeli soldier he had recently met. Ari, 22, was badly wounded in Gaza, losing two limbs. Wheelchair-bound, Ari had thanked Shapiro for his efforts on behalf of Israel and then astonished him by asking, 'I just have a quick question. I want to know what more can I do.' 'That’s an ethos that needs to be carried forward, not just on behalf of Israel, not just on behalf of Jews who live abroad, like me, but on behalf of Americans, on behalf of the West,' said Shapiro. Shapiro lavished praise on Israel for the way it fought back after the tragedy of Oct. 7, noting that 'a country that seemed to be fraying at every corner proved more durable and stronger than the social fabric of pretty much any other nation on the planet.' He also offered constructive criticism, calling on Israel to free itself of unnecessary bureaucracy, calling it a relic of the country’s socialist past, to pave the way toward greater economic and military strength. He called for all Israelis to take an equal share in military service, a reference to the hot-button issue in Israel of haredi, or ultra-Orthodox Jews refusing to serve. Speaking of Israel’s efforts to convince the world of the rightness of its cause, Shapiro said these efforts have failed because Israel’s enemies hate it precisely for its success and for being in the right. 'The world of moral persuasion is not where Israel is going to guarantee its future. The world of independence and strength is where Israel always has and always will guarantee its future,' he said. At the conference, awards were also handed out to soldiers fresh from the front. Shortly before coming to the stage, Murray met two of them. 'You are the tip of the spear for the entire free world,' he told the reservists, who had only hours before been fighting in Lebanon.

Israel sanctions dozens of clients of Hezbollah’s banking network	AQAH, often referred to as Hezbollah’s 'bank,' is technically a charitable association. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Defense Ministry announced sanctions on dozens of clients of the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, a network of unofficial banks used by Hezbollah to both raise and launder money, on Thursday. 'We will lay our hands on all those who support terror, on every front and with every means,' said Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement, saying the move’s goal was to 'collapse the terror networks and hit those who provide them economic oxygen.' The ministry did not name the targeted entities, but said 'deposited significant amounts with the association, which directly funds the activities of the declared terror organization Hezbollah.' The ministry said money deposited with the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association (AQAH) is used to purchase weapons and pay the salaries of Hezbollah terrorists, among other things. Israeli airstrikes targeted 20 of AQAH’s 34 branches in key Hezbollah strongholds, including Beirut, Tyre, Sidon and Baalbek on Oct. 20. In comments to The Press Service of Israel after the strikes, one senior figure in the Israeli intelligence community described AQAH as 'one of the largest centers of economic power for the Iranian proxy.' She also suggested that its competition with the Lebanese banking sector contributed to the country’s economic instability, while Hezbollah benefitted from a parallel, unregulated financial system. AQAH, often referred to as Hezbollah’s 'bank,' is technically a charitable association. Established in 1982, AQAH expanded significantly to 34 branches against the backdrop of Lebanon’s economic crisis. It specializes in providing microloans to Lebanon’s Shiite community, which predominantly supports Hezbollah. These loans serve various needs, from wedding expenses to agricultural development and solar energy farms. By further financing hospitals, schools, housing and other Hezbollah social services in areas where traditional banking services are inaccessible or distrusted, AQAH bolstered Hezbollah’s ability to act as a 'state within a state.' According to Israeli officials, AQAH is believed to handle approximately $500 million in transactions each year, with a total turnover of $3.5 billion recorded before 2019. The group’s financial activities have drawn scrutiny due to suspected connections with Iran, which is a major financier of Hezbollah. In addition to providing loans, the bank allegedly serves as a means of laundering funds for terrorism-related activities. The U.S. Treasury Dept. sanctioned AQAH in 2007. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hezbollah rocket barrage hits park in northern Israel, killing on...	Lebanese terrorists fire 10 rockets at northwestern Israel, with one direct hit scored on public park in Nahariya, killing an Israeli man. By World Israel News Staff One person was killed and two more were injured in the northern Israeli city of Nahariya, after Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon launched a barrage of rockets towards the Western Galilee Thursday afternoon. At least ten rocket launches were detected at approximately 12:00 p.m. Thursday, the IDF said, with one projectile striking a public park in Nahariya. According to an army spokesperson, most of the ten rockets were either intercepted by Israel's missile defense network, or landed in open areas. A man in his 30s was hit by shrapnel from the rocket which struck Nahariya, leaving him fatally wounded, paramedics said. Emergency first responders from United Hatzalah and Magen David Adom were dispatched to the scene to treat the man, but were unable to revive him. 'Witnesses told us that the victim was struck by shrapnel that landed in a public park,' said Barak Lavi, a United Hatzalah medic who responded to the attack. 'Unfortunately, due to the severe nature of his injuries, there was nothing more we could do.' MDA first responders said the victim was declared dead at the scene. 'We arrived at an open area near a playground and found a man in his 30s lying unconscious with shrapnel wounds to his body,' MDA medic Dor Vaknin said. 'We performed medical checks, but he showed no signs of life and we were forced to pronounce him dead.' This is the fourth fatality reported in Hezbollah attacks on Nahariya in the past month. Two other victims, a 40-year-old woman and a 44-year-old woman, were lightly injured from blast-related injuries and cuts from glass fragments in Thursday's rocket attack, MDA said, while six others were treated for shock.

Israel Aerospace Industries reports most profitable year in its h...	International demand for Israel’s military technology has surged as European countries increased their defense budgets in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel Aerospace Industries reported a record-breaking order backlog of approximately $25 billion and a 74% increase in net income in its third-quarter earnings report released on Thursday. 'During this time, we have achieved unprecedented milestones, not just in technological and business terms but as a testament to our commitment to excellence,' said IAI chairman Amir Peretz. Net income for the nine months ending September 30 rose sharply to $416 million, up from $239 million in the same period last year, making it the most profitable period in the state-owned company’s history. For the third quarter alone, net income increased to $122 million, a significant rise from $74 million in Q3 2023. The growth was driven by IAI’s Missile and Space Systems Division, with $1.87 billion in sales for the first nine months of 2024, up from $1.63 billion in 2023. The Arrow missile system earned global acclaim, supported by increased R&D investment of $81 million in Q3, up from $65 million. IAI also reported a record-breaking $25 billion order backlog as of September 30, 2024. This represents a $7.22 billion increase from the previous year and secures 3.5 years of operations at current sales volumes. International demand for Israel’s military technology has surged as European countries increased their defense budgets in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Israel is developing a multilayered aerial defense system that has drawn global attention. The Arrow-3 system, which is designed to intercept ballistic missiles, had its first operational success when it shot down a ballistic missile fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen in November. It is widely believed to be the first time a missile was intercepted in outer space, but Israeli officials have not confirmed this. Operating income during the nine months grew to $431 million, up from $292 million in 2023. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the nine-month period reached $646 million, a 33% increase year-over-year, while gross profit for the third quarter climbed 25% to $282 million, reflecting an 18% profit margin. The company’s sales also rose, reaching $4.39 billion for the nine-month period, a 13% increase from $3.87 billion in the previous year. Third-quarter sales alone totaled $1.54 billion, up 16% from Q3 2023. This growth was driven by increased demand across all business divisions, with particularly strong performance in the Military and Aviation groups. 'Despite a national crisis, IAI maintained supply chain continuity and expanded its global relationships. Our systems play a critical role in Israel’s defense while strengthening our international standing,' said IAI President and CEO Boaz Levy.

Ceasefire deal is ‘in Israel’s hands’ says Hezbollah as Biden env...	Amos Hochstein arrives in Israel following truce talks in Beirut, as top Hezbollah official says the ball is now in Israel’s court. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Amos Hochstein arrived in Israel Wednesday, following extensive talks with Lebanese and Hezbollah officials in Beirut, as part of a last-ditch effort by the Biden administration to secure a truce between Israel and Hezbollah before the president leaves office on January 20th. Hochstein declared Wednesday that he had made 'additional progress' in talks with Nabih Berri, speaker of the Lebanese parliament and a leader of Amal, a Shi’ite movement with ties to Hezbollah. Berri has served as an interlocutor for Hezbollah in talks with Hochstein. 'The meeting today built on the meeting yesterday, and made additional progress,' Hochstein said. 'So I will travel from here in a couple of hours to Israel to try to bring this to a close if we can.' This week’s talks have yielded a 'real opportunity' to reach a deal, Hochstein added. According to Axios, Hochstein was slated to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday morning, after having met with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer Wednesday evening. Hezbollah secretary-general Naim Qassem, successor to Hassan Nasrallah, appeared to signal his group’s support for the American draft proposal for a ceasefire, saying Wednesday that a truce is 'in Israel’s hands.' In a televised address, Qassem said Hezbollah had presented its 'comments' on the American proposal to Hochstein via Berri, signaling its willingness to cooperate in the 'indirect negotiations' with Israel. 'These comments were presented to the US envoy and they were discussed with him in detail,' Qassem said. 'The comments we presented show that we approve this track of indirect negotiations through Speaker Berri.' Qassem rejected Israel’s demand that Israel retain the right to operate militarily in Lebanon should Hezbollah abrogate the ceasefire. The U.S. draft proposal presented to Lebanese officials and Hezbollah earlier this month focuses on three main points: the disarming of Hezbollah forces both north and south of the Litani River; the formation of an international committee headed by an American general to oversee the implementation of the ceasefire; and Israel’s right to respond military in Lebanon should Hezbollah violate the truce – but only after the committee has exhausted attempts to restore the peace.

Israeli commando killed in building collapse in Lebanon	Three soldiers have been killed in the last two days while fighting Hezbollah. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A soldier in a reserve unit of the IDF’s elite Maglan commandos was killed Wednesday when a building collapsed on him in a village in southern Lebanon. Sgt. First Class Eitan Ben Ami, 22, was walking with his comrades through the structure during an active operation, using its cover to protect themselves. Along with others in the area, the building had been damaged by earlier Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire in advance of the military maneuvers. The initial IDF investigation showed that its sudden collapse was due to the weather conditions, rather than any hidden bombs that might have been detonated by Hezbollah forces, or active fire directed at the building. There had just been a heavy rainfall on the previous night. Four soldiers were injured in the incident and were taken to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya for treatment as the unit worked for hours to extract Ben Ami’s body from the ruins. The army said it was studying the incident in order to draw operational conclusions for the future. Ben Ami was a native of Jerusalem. Another resident of the capital, Sgt. First Class (res.) Omer Moshe Gaeldor, 30, was killed the previous day in southern Lebanon. A fighter in the 5111th Reconnaissance Battalion of the Golani Brigade, he was killed by a Hezbollah drone strike while his group was securing an area about two kilometers from the Israeli border. Three soldiers were seriously injured when the explosive drone hit, and they were all airlifted to hospital. Gaeldor, 30, was a cancer survivor and was thus not called up to serve but went anyway, his brother Nitzan said. 'He recovered from cancer two years ago and didn't have to enlist,' he told Kan’s Reshet Bet. 'The mutual decision made by him and his wife, Adi, for him to volunteer and go to the reserves was some kind of comfort, because he believed in what he was doing. He didn't hesitate and enlisted himself on October 7th.' Gaeldor had spent 'more than 250 days' on duty, Nitzan added, even though 'he didn't enjoy being in the army. We're not a military family and neither was he. But the necessity to change reality for the good of all called him.' Gaeldor is survived by his parents, wife, and two young children, eight-month-old Alouma and 3-year-old Neta. Thursday morning, the army announced the name of the Golani soldier who had been killed in battle Wednesday in Lebanon alongside a civilian, Ze’ev 'Jabo' Hanoch Erlich, a 71-year-old tour guide known for his deep knowledge of Israeli history and archeology. Sgt. Gur Kehati (20) from Nir Banim was killed and two officers wounded, including the Golani Brigade's chief of staff, Col. Yoav Yarom, when two Hezbollah fighters opened fire at the group from close range. Ehrlich, who held the rank of major in the IDF reserves, had been brought to the combat unit by an officer who had not asked for permission to do so from his commanders. Kehati is the 803rd soldier to fall since the Hamas invasion 13 months ago set off the ongoing war, and the 46th since Israel invaded southern Lebanon in October to stop Hezbollah’s constant rocket and UAV attacks on the Jewish state in support of Hamas.

UN a ‘den of antisemitism’ that betrayed Israel and US, says Trum...	Rep. Elise Stefanik, tapped by Trump to represent the US at the United Nations, castigates the international body, accusing it of serving as a 'den of antisemitism.' By World Israel News Staff A Republican lawmaker nominated by former President and President-elect Donald Trump to represent the United States in the United Nations castigated the international body on Tuesday, calling the UN a 'den of antisemitism.' Rep. Elise Stefanik, 40, who currently represents New York's 21st congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives, has been tapped by Trump to replace Linda Thomas-Greenfield as American Ambassador to the UN, addressed an annual awards dinner held by the Endowment for Middle East Truth (EMET) in Washington D.C. Tuesday evening. During her speech, Stefanik, chairwoman of the Republican Conference in the House of Representatives, accused the UN of betraying both Israel and the U.S., while serving as an 'apologist' for Tehran and its terrorist proxies. 'Even before the barbaric terrorist attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7, the U.N. has continuously betrayed Israel and betrayed America, acting as an apologist for Iran and their terrorist proxies,' Stefanik said. 'You have my commitment, as I have led this fight in Congress against vile antisemitism, I will stand up for President Trump’s America-first, peace-through-strength policies and bring moral truth and crystal-clear moral clarity at the United Nations on day one.' Stefanik referenced the 101 captives still held hostage in the Gaza Strip, including seven with American citizenship, calling their return a top priority. 'There are still over 100 hostages, including seven Americans, being held by Hamas,' Stefanik continued. 'We must not stop, and we will not stop until every hostage is brought home.' Citing examples of the UN's misconduct regarding Israel and Iranian proxy forces, Stefanik noted the ties between the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and Gaza terror groups including Hamas, and the agency's continued unquestioning reliance on Hamas casualty figures in the ongoing Gaza war. Stefanik claimed that had Trump been in office last year, 'October 7th would never have happened,' and vowed to 'stand up for' Trump's 'America First, peace through strength policies and bring moral truth and crystal clear moral clarity at the United Nations on Day One.' The State of Israel, she added 'is a miracle,' calling the Jewish state 'foundational to the United States.'

Shin Bet, police thwart Ben-Gvir assassination plot	Three Palestinian men reportedly consulted with Hamas, Hezbollah regarding how to murder National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. By World Israel News Staff Three Palestinians who plotted to assassinate National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir were arrested, the Shin Bet intelligence agency and Israeli police said in a joint media statement on Thursday morning. According to the security forces, the men, all residents of Hebron, established a terror cell and planned to murder Ben-Gvir. The minister has often advocated for harsh punishments against Arab terrorists, including the death penalty. His tough stance on terror has resulted in numerous threats to his life. According to the indictment filed in a military court earlier this week, the men reportedly consulted with the Hamas and Hezbollah regarding their strategy and sought material support for the plot from the terror groups. The ringleader of the plot, named as Ismail Ibrahim Awadi, reached out to various sources in June 2024 in an attempt to procure weapons for the assassination. Awadi gathered intelligence regarding Ben-Gvir's frequent travel routes to and from his home in a Jewish enclave within Hebron. He also learned which vehicles are used by the minister and his eldest son, and how many bodyguards typically accompanied them. The cell weighed different options regarding the location of the assassination, and considered murdering Ben-Gvir when he traveled to the scene of a terror attack to speak with survivors, as he often does. 'I extend my gratitude to the Judea and Samaria District Police and the Shin Bet for their dedication in apprehending and prosecuting the terrorist cell that planned to assassinate me and my son Shuvael,' Ben-Gvir said in a media statement after news of the arrests were made public. 'Thanks to their relentless efforts and, by the grace of God, another attempt by the enemy to harm me and my family has been thwarted,' he added. 'I remain committed to toughening prison conditions for terrorists, strengthening Israeli sovereignty and governance, distributing weapons for self-defense, demolishing illegal structures, and achieving a decisive victory over our enemies. No terrorist will deter me.'

Civilian scholar killed during unauthorized Lebanon visit with ID...	Ze'ev 'Jabo' Erlich, 71, was a prominent researcher of Israeli geography and legendary Judea and Samaria tour guide. By World Israel News Staff A 71-year-old Israeli civilian was killed by Hezbollah gunfire in southern Lebanon on Wednesday, after he entered the combat zone alongside an IDF unit, without official authorization from the army to do so. Ze'ev 'Jabo' Hanoch Erlich, a prominent researcher and scholar of Israeli geography, accompanied a Golani Brigade unit to an ancient archaeological site near Tyre. Hebrew-language media reported that Erlich did not receive the necessary permission from the army to enter southern Lebanon as a civilian. Despite not being an active-duty soldier, Erlich was apparently provided a gun, helmet, and military uniform. According to Channel 12 News, Erlich was shot dead by Hezbollah terrorists at the Shrine of the Prophet Shimon in the village of Shama. A Golani Brigade soldier, whose name has not been made public, was also killed in the incident. Golani Brigade Chief of Staff Brig. Gen. Yoav Yarom, ,a close friend of Erlich, was reported to have been seriously wounded. Preliminary findings from an ongoing military investigation indicated that Erlich likely visited Lebanon on several prior occasions in recent weeks, alongside IDF troops. Although Erlich entered Lebanon without the proper authorization and not as a soldier, the army made the unusual decision to posthumously recognize him as a fallen soldier. That makes Erlich, at 71, the oldest soldier to be killed in battle since the October 7th war began, and possibly the oldest in Israeli history. In order for a civilian to embed with IDF troops and tour southern Lebanon, IDF senior officials, such as regional commanders, must grant specific permission for their entry. That permission is typically reserved for members of the Knesset, foreign dignitaries, and journalists. Erlich, who was one of the founders of the Jewish community of Ofra in Samaria, is survived by his wife and six children. 'It’s hard to fathom the immense tragedy of losing our dear friend Ze’ev ‘Jabo’ Erlich. Jabo was one of the founding figures in the field of tour guiding and the study of Judea and Samaria. Our generation followed his lead, hanging on his every word,' Yaron Rosenthal, head of the Gush Etzion Regional Council and a friend of Erlich, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'For years, he guided and researched with unparalleled curiosity, exploring every nook and cranny and investigating every archaeological site. Few people had such a profound passion for the land and loved it as deeply as he did. To me, Jabo was also a dear friend and a mentor from whom I learned so much over the years. I will miss him deeply. We will do our best to follow in the footsteps of the giant he was.'

Bill to ban weapons exports to Israel defeated in Senate	Nearly one-third of Democratic Senators voted to ban arms exports to Israel. By World Israel News Staff A bill proposing a ban on the export of U.S. weapons to Israel was soundly defeated in a 79-18 vote in the Senate on Wednesday, with one senator voting present. The measure, proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), aimed to ban the sale of tank munitions, mortar munitions and JDAM systems to Israel. Although the bill was defeated, almost one-third of Democratic senators voted in favor of it. 18 Democrats voted in favor of banning a $774 million sale of tank rounds, 19 Democrats agreed to block the $61 million sale of mortar rounds, and 17 Democrats attempted to ban the $262 million sale of joint direct attack munitions (JDAMs). 'It goes without saying that Israel had a right to defend itself from the horrific Hamas terrorist attack of October 7, but Israel did not have the right to kill 43,000 Palestinians and injure over 100,000, most of whom are women, children and the elderly,' Sanders said when speaking about the bill in the Senate. Notably, Sanders uncritically repeated statistics provided by the Hamas terror group regarding the numbers of casualties, which do not distinguish between the deaths of terrorists engaged in combat and civilians. Those numbers are also proven to be wildly exaggerated, with the United Nations quietly revising their casualty count by half. Continuing to rail against Israel, Sanders falsely claimed that Israel is starving 'thousands and thousands of children' in Gaza. Sanders failed to mention that Hamas regularly steals humanitarian aid, stockpiling it in warehouses and then selling it at exorbitant prices to Gazan civilians. Those who have attempted to distribute aid to civilians have regularly been murdered by the terror group. Although he is a harsh critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer staunchly opposed Sanders' bill. 'Voting to block assistance today could very well embolden Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran, and endanger Israel's security on into the future,' Schumer said. 'This is about Israel's long term security and honoring a cornerstone of United States policy that we will give Israel, a democracy and a steadfast ally, the resources it needs to protect itself in a difficult world,' he added.

Convicted terrorists threaten to continue war against Israel insi...	A convicted Hamas terrorist said, 'You will end the war outside; we will start it in prison.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel Prison Services (IPS) Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi told the Knesset National Security Committee that convicted Hamas terrorists are threatening to start a war inside prison even if Israel should agree to a ceasefire. Referring to Israel's prisons as 'the eighth front' of the war, Yaakobi told the committee that an imprisoned Hamas official said, 'You will end the war outside; we will start it in prison.' He also said Fatah terrorists threatened, 'We will have our Independence Day inside the prison.' Yaakobi told the committee, 'These quotes reverberate with me, and I am preparing myself with the means and preparing the team accordingly.' In an interview with Maariv, Yaakobi emphasized the need for IPS to have tight security and advanced intelligence. He said, 'The prison service must have strong intelligence,' Yaakobi stated. 'We possess the potential to greatly enhance both security and crime prevention, directly impacting public safety beyond prison walls.' In addition to concern over potential violence by inmates, Yaakobi said IPS should focus on preventing terrorists infiltration among prison staff. 'Prominent crime organizations try to infiltrate our ranks,' he said. 'That's why polygraph tests are essential.' He added that some prison employees were caught trying to smuggle contraband into the jails. Yaakobi urged government officials and IPS employees to consider the prison system as an additional front in the war. He explained, 'This is a current and operational front. We refer to it as the 'eighth front,' alongside Lebanon, Iran, and Iraq. We are adjusting our leadership and enhancing our offensive capabilities to address it.' Yaakobi described how IPS is coordinating with security agencies to deal with terrorist threats within the prisons. He remarked, 'We are confiscating hundreds of weapons and thwarting numerous plots.' Intelligence provided by IPS and Shin Bet has uncovered multiple schemes targeting staff members. 'These threats are still very serious,' Yaakobi cautioned, emphasizing the need for sufficient funding to strengthen intelligence operations.

‘Zionists are not welcome here’: Anti-Israel Harvard students pro...	Harvard Hillel executive director Jason B. Rubenstein said there were five times as many participants at the event than protesters. By Jessica Costescu, The Washington Free Beacon Anti-Israel students protested outside Harvard University's Hillel on Monday evening, shouting, 'Zionists are not welcome here,' as students walked into the Jewish community center. The anti-Israel student group, Harvard Jews for Palestine, organized the protest against former Israel Defense Forces spokesman Ronen Manelis, who was speaking inside the Hillel. About a dozen agitators accused Israel of being a 'terrorist state' and held banners with messages such as 'Hillel Hosts War Criminals.' SHOCKING. PLEASE SHARE: Tonight, Harvard students yelled 'Zionists are not welcomed here' outside the Harvard Hillel as Jewish students were entering. It’s simply shocking how normalized antisemitism and intimidation has become on college campuses. DEFUND HARVARD NOW! pic.twitter.com/nDaSPMOFtV &mdash; Shabbos Kestenbaum (@ShabbosK) November 19, 2024 'Israel is solely responsible for the genocide it is committing. It always has been. There is no justification,' Harvard Jews for Palestine wrote Monday on Instagram. 'War crimes aren't 'Jewish life.' IOF off our campus out of Lebanon and out of Gaza.' 'IOF,' or 'Israel Occupying Force,' is an anti-Israel slur for the IDF. Inside Hillel, Manelis was discussing how Iran's aggression toward Israel is reshaping the Middle East and the multi-front challenges the Jewish state faces in the evolving conflict. He told the Washington Free Beacon he condemned 'the baseless accusations made by the protesters' and vowed to 'continue to share Israel's voice around the world.' 'It's surprising that at a place like Harvard, known for free speech and open debate, there's such ignorance and unwillingness to engage in real conversation,' Manelis said. 'Especially after the October 7th massacre, I believe students should be open to hearing different opinions instead of chanting empty slogans.' Harvard Hillel executive director Jason B. Rubenstein said there were five times as many participants at the event than protesters. He added that the Harvard University Police Department worked closely with Hillel to ensure that the event proceeded and that participants were not harassed. 'Zionism, the pursuit of Jewish self-determination in the land of Israel, is a central element of the religious identity of thousands of Jewish Harvard affiliates,' Rubenstein told the Free Beacon. ''Zionists are not welcome here,' a call for discrimination against much of our community due to our sincerely held beliefs, is bigotry.' Violet Barron, an anti-Israel student organizer and Harvard Crimson editorial editor who has accused Israel of apartheid, told the student paper that she saw the 'Zionists are not welcome here' chant as 'kind of equivalent with 'Racists are not welcome here.'' 'Zionism is, first and foremost, a political ideology, and a genocidal one at that,' she added. Harvard did not respond to a request for comment.

US vetoes UN security council resolution on Gaza ceasefire, says ...	As we stated many times before, we just can’t support an unconditional ceasefire that does not call for the immediate release of hostages,' a senior US official said. By The Algemeiner and Reuters The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution for a ceasefire in Israel’s war in Gaza, accusing council members of cynically rejecting attempts at reaching a compromise. The 15-member council voted on a resolution put forward by its 10 non-permanent members in a meeting that called for an 'immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire' and separately demand the release of hostages. Only the US voted against, using its veto as a permanent council member to block the resolution. A senior US official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of the vote, said the US would only support a resolution that explicitly calls for the immediate release of hostages as part of a ceasefire. 'As we stated many times before, we just can’t support an unconditional ceasefire that does not call for the immediate release of hostages,' the official said. Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists began the ongoing war with their invasion of southern Israel last Oct. 7. During the onslaught, the terrorists killed 1,200 people, wounded thousands, and kidnapped over 250 hostages, taking them to Hamas-ruled Gaza. Israel responded with a military campaign aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities in the neighboring Palestinian enclave. Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, Britain put forward new language that the US would have supported as a compromise, but that was rejected, the US official said. Some of the council’s 10 elected members (E10) were more interested in bringing about a US veto than compromising on the resolution, the official said, accusing Russia and China of encouraging those members. 'China kept demanding ‘stronger language’ and Russia appeared to be pulling strings with various [elected] 10 members,' the official said. 'This really does undercut the narrative that this was an organic reflection of the E10 and there’s some sense that some E10 members regret that those responsible for the drafting allowed the process to be manipulated for what we consider to be cynical purposes.'

By Pesach Benson, TPS Five Palestinian terrorists were killed as Israeli security forces destroyed four explosives laboratories in Jenin, the Israel Defense Forces disclosed on Wednesday as a crackdown on terror groups entered its second day. The army said it also confiscated weapons parts and five lathes used for producing weapons. A camera warehouse used by terror groups and dozens of explosives were also destroyed. Seven terror suspects were arrested. Meanwhile in Hebron, Israeli security forces arrested four wanted Palestinians, confiscated weapons and questioned dozens of other suspects. This comes ahead of this weekend’s Jewish celebrations at the Tomb of the Patriarchs. The Torah portion read on Saturday recounts Abraham’s purchase of the Cave of Machpeilah where he buried Sarah. The other Patriarchs and their wives are also buried in the tomb. The annual celebration draws thousands of Jews. Since the October 7 attacks, Israeli security forces have arrested more than 5,300 wanted Palestinians in Judea and Samaria, of whom around 40% are associated with Hamas. כוחות צה'ל, מג״ב ושב״כ פועלים מזה שתי יממות במבצע בג׳נין כחלק מרצף המבצעים לסיכול טרור בצפון השומרון. הכוחות חיסלו עד כה חמישה מחבלים, והחרימו שבעה כלי נשק. כמו כן הושמדו ארבע מעבדות מטענים, חמ'ל מצלמות ועשרות מטענים>> pic.twitter.com/3aFYbMW2UB &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 20, 2024 The post Israeli forces destroy bomb-making labs in Jenin as terror crackdown enters second day appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/israeli-forces-destroy-bomb-making-labs-in-jenin-as-terror-crackdown-enters-second-day/	2024-11-20T09:34:16-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/idf-jenin-bomb-lab.jpg
Israeli strikes in Iraq could be ‘imminent,’ US reportedly warns	Israel has already warned the Iraqi government that unless it reins in the militias, it faces Israeli strikes on its territory. By JNS The United States has informed Baghdad that Israeli strikes in Iraq are 'imminent' if the Iraqi government fails to stop Iranian-backed militias from attacking the Jewish state, Arab media reported on Wednesday. The U.S. told Iraq it has exhausted 'all means of pressure' on Jerusalem and has urged Baghdad to take swift action to prevent these attacks, the reports by Al-Hadath and other Saudi-owned news outlets claimed. On Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar called on the United Nations Security Council to take 'immediate action' against the Iranian-backed militias in Iraq launching drones and missiles at the Jewish state. In a letter sent to the Security Council president for November, British Ambassador Barbara Woodward, Sa’ar expressed 'grave concern over the significant increase in the frequency and the intensity of attacks on Israel conducted by the Iranian-backed militias' since September. He warned that the ongoing attacks 'have the potential to further drag the region in a very dangerous escalation while posing a significant threat to international peace and security,' noting that Jerusalem’s right to self-defense against threats from Iraq is enshrined in the U.N. Charter. Israel has already warned the Iraqi government that unless it reins in the militias, it faces Israeli strikes on its territory, the Saudi website Elaph reported earlier this month. Unnamed officials told the news outlet that satellites were monitoring the movement of ballistic missiles and related equipment from Iran to Iraq, which could be used in an attack on Israel. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani dismissed Sa’ar’s letter as a 'pretext and argument to attack Iraq' and to 'expand the war in the region,' speaking in a statement on Tuesday. His office claimed that Baghdad has refused to enter into the regional conflict with the Jewish state while 'seeking to provide relief to the Palestinian and Lebanese people.' The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an Iranian-backed amalgamation of terrorist groups, on Wednesday claimed responsibility for an attempted drone attack on a 'military target' in Israel’s north on Tuesday night. The IDF confirmed that it shot down a drone that was fired at the Jewish state 'from the east,' a phrase the army uses to refer to Iraq. The drone was shot down before entering Israeli airspace, the Air Force said. On Oct. 3, two Israeli soldiers were killed when an explosive-laden drone launched from Iraq hit an IDF base in the Golan Heights.

‘Israel, we’ve got your back,’ vows new Senate Majority Leader	Reinforcements are on the way,' declares incoming Senate Majority Leader, vowing to push back against Democratic efforts to impose arms embargo on Israel and to combat ICC's 'unlawful' attempt to arrest Prime Minister Netanyahu. By World Israel News Staff The next leader of the Republican Senate caucus, who is expected to be voted in as Senate Majority Leader in January, vowed that under his leadership, the upper chamber of Congress will 'have Israel's back.' South Dakota Senator John Thune, who recently won an internal leadership race for control of the Republican Senate caucus, held a press conference Tuesday, castigating the incumbent Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, and other Senate Democrats over failure to take action against the International Criminal Court's attempts to have senior Israeli officials arrested. 'That is outrageous, and it is unlawful. The ICC rogue actions are a threat to our ally Israel and, left unchecked, could pose a threat to America in the future.' Thune also ripped Senate Democrats pushing measures, set to be voted upon Wednesday, which would bar the sale of billions of dollars worth of military equipment to Israel, including the latest variant of the F-15 fighter jet, tank shells, and guided missiles. 'The refusal to have our ally’s back and the hesitation to call out antisemitism in our own country has consequences,' Thune said. 'It enables bad behavior and bad actors around the world and encourages others to abandon Israel in their time of need.' Republicans picked up four seats in the upper chamber in the November elections, giving them a 53-47 majority in the incoming Congress. Once the new Congress is seated on January 3rd and Thune elected Majority Leader, he said, the Republican-controlled Senate would make Israel a 'top priority in the next Congress.' 'So to our allies in Israel, and to the Jewish people around the world, my message to you is this: Reinforcements are on the way.'

10 years in prison for Jordanian MP terror smuggler	Former Jordanian MP found guilty of attempting to smuggle hundreds of weapons to terrorists in PA territory. By World Israel News Staff A former Jordanian member of parliament who was caught smuggling weapons into Palestinian Authority-controlled territory - presumably for use in terror attacks against Israelis - was sentenced to 10 years in prison by a Jordanian court on Wednesday. Imad al-Adwan, 36, was arrested at the Allenby Crossing by Israeli security forces in April 2023. At the time, Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency said that al-Adwan had been caught transporting 12 automatic weapons and 194 pistols in his car. During a Shin Bet investigaton, al-Adwan reportedly admitted to have carried out smuggling trips from Jordan to PA-controlled territory at least 12 times in a two month span. Along with weapons, he admitted he had illegally smuggled birds, electronic cigarettes and gold. After two weeks being detained in Israel, Jerusalem released al-Adwan to Jordanian custody in May 2023. Shortly thereafter, he was charged with numerous weapons trafficking offenses. A court found al-Adwan guilty on Wednesday, sentencing him to 10 years in prison and hard labor. One of al-Adwan's co-defendants in the case was found not guilty of all charges. A third defendant, who is believed to have fled Jordan, was found guilty in absentia and sentenced to 15 years in prison. A prominent critic of Jordan's peace treaty with Israel, al-Adwan was a member of the parliament's Palestine Committee and frequently railed against the Jewish State. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir was critical of the decision to release al-Adwan to the Jordanian authorities. Returning the 'terrorist who attempted to bring hundreds of weapons into Israel, to be used in attacks and crimes in the heart of the country' back to Jordan was 'a strategic and moral mistake,' Ben-Gvir said at the time in a statement. 'This diplomat should have spent years in prison in Israel and not been released,' he added.

Trump to tap Howard Lutnick for Commerce Secretary	If confirmed by the Senate, he would oversee the agency focused on U.S. economic growth and promoting domestic industries. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon President-elect Donald Trump is expected to tap Wall Street financier Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department, the Wall Street Journal reported. Lutnick, chair and CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, is currently serving as co-chair of the Trump transition team. The Jewish Republican publicly endorsed the president-elect's proposed tariffs on U.S. imports, which he would have a key role in implementing as commerce secretary. If confirmed by the Senate, he would oversee the agency focused on U.S. economic growth and promoting domestic industries. Trump considered Lutnick to lead the Treasury Department, but investor Scott Bessent has since emerged as a leading contender, according to the Journal. Lutnick, a major donor to Zionist causes, said he joined Trump’s campaign primarily because of the former president’s support for Israel and his response to Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks. 'He had clear, moral clarity when it came to Israel and what happened, and the way that he thought about what happened,' Lutnick told the Philadelphia Inquirer last month. 'That was huge to me.'

White House worried as Senate Democrats push arms embargo against...	Bernie Sanders joins progressive Democrats in pushing bill, set to go up for a vote Wednesday, that would block sales of major weapons systems to Israel, including fighter jets, missiles, tank ammunition, and more. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration is pushing back against a set of bills set to be brought before the Democratic-controlled Senate Wednesday which would, if passed, impose a sweeping arms embargo against Israel, according to a report Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, four progressive members of the Democratic Senate caucus held a press conference in the Capitol, in support of legislation preventing the sale of key weapons systems to Israel. Vermont's Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, was joined by Maryland's Chris Van Hollen, Oregon's Jeff Merkley, and Vermont's Peter Welch at the press conference, addressing a set of Joint Resolutions of Disapproval sponsored by senators Sanders, Welch, Merkley, and Hawaii's Brian Schatz. The package of bills, set to be voted on Wednesday, would prevent the transfer of at least 6 weapons systems to Israel, forcing the cancellation of over $20 billion worth of contracts. The impacted contracts include deals for the sale of advanced versions of the F-15 fighter jet, tank shells, guided missiles, mortars, and ground vehicles. In his address Tuesday, Sanders castigated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, decrying it as being 'extremist,' and accusing Israel of going beyond a measured response to the October 7th, 2023 invasion. 'Israel clearly had a right to respond to the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7th,' said Sanders. 'But Prime Minister Netanyahu’s extremist government has not simply waged war against Hamas. It has waged all-out war against the Palestinian people.' Existing legislation regarding the sale of military equipment to foreign militaries are 'very clear,' Sanders continued. 'The United States cannot provide weaponry to countries that violate internationally-recognized human rights, or block U.S. humanitarian aid. According to the United Nations, much of the international community and every humanitarian organization on the ground in Gaza, Israel is clearly in violation of these laws.' Two U.S. officials told The Times of Israel that the Biden administration is actively working to block passage of the legislation, lobbying Democratic senators to vote against the measures. While the measures are widely expected to fail in the narrowly divided Senate, where Democrats hold just a two-seat advantage, the White House fears that Wednesday's vote could mark a turning point within the party regarding support for Israel, and is hoping after this month's electoral defeat to bolster moderate elements within the party. Last week, the Biden administration declined to impose new restrictions on the transfer of weapons to Israel, after a 30-day deadline passed regarding administration demands on Israel to ensure increased aid flow into Gaza and to limit the use of mass evacuation orders in the Gaza Strip.

Reservist KIA in Gaza is 800th IDF war casualty	A senior officer in the battalion was seriously wounded in the same incident, which occurred in the Beit Lahiya area. By JNS Sgt. First Class (res.) Roi Sasson was killed in action in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces announced on Wednesday. Sasson, 21, was from the Jerusalem suburb of Mevaseret and served with the 90th 'Nahshon' Battalion of the Kfir Brigade. He is Israel’s 800th military fatality since the start of the war on Oct. 7, 2023, and the 379th soldier killed in Gaza since the start of the ground operation there on Oct. 27, 2023. A senior officer in the battalion was seriously wounded in the same incident, which occurred in the Beit Lahiya area. In addition to the military casualties, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Israel planning military government in Gaza, as activists push fo...	Facts on the ground are being created without an official government decision on the matter, according to Ynet. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Some officials in the IDF’s Southern Command are pushing for a military government to be in charge of the Gaza Strip after Israel defeats Hamas, and are working with those political forces in favor of the move, Ynet reported Wednesday. Implementation of such a plan also includes the seizure of more territory in the Strip. The IDF has already established a no-go zone on the entire Gazan border with Israel, and greatly expanded its Netzarim Corridor that divides northern and southern Gaza. It has also somewhat widened the Philadelphi Corridor on the Gazan side of the border with Egypt, which will better prevent arms smuggling to Hamas so it cannot revive itself militarily. The report said that the IDF is also establishing military outposts in the coastal enclave, with the aim of all this being to enable 'the de facto imposition of military rule.' Citing sources familiar with the details, the news site said that in recent days, lively discussions have been taking place on the subject between various parties, including new Defense Minister Yisrael Katz, senior defense officials, and other senior ministers. The report also noted that that the government is supposedly 'working step by step' towards this goal without an official decision being made on who would rule in Gaza on 'the day after.' It is no secret that the national-religious parties in the coalition, Otzma Yehudit and the Religious Zionist Party, are in favor of Israel retaining control of Gaza after the war, seeing it as the only way to ensure Israel’s security in the long term. The current push is the result of two occurrences, one local and one abroad, the report said. The first was the dismissal two weeks ago of Yoav Gallant as defense minister, as he was a fierce opponent of Israel becoming responsible for all civilian life in Gaza, which is a position still held by most if not all of the senior echelon of the IDF. The second was Donald Trump’s victory in this month’s presidential elections. Trump has announced a 'dream team' of Americans who favor right-wing Israeli policies as his point men for issues in the Middle East, including the incoming Secretary of State Marco Rubio and ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee. The report said elements in the settlement movement are saying that 'this is a historic period of time for changing the reality on the ground vis-à-vis the Palestinians, and an opportunity that will not come again,' so that now is the time, even before Trump’s inauguration, to make concrete plans to rebuild Jewish communities at least in northern Gaza. In their view, such plans and the taking of territory would then become the basis for the activities of the new administration, the report said. Part of the reason that there are voices in the military in favor of seizing land in Gaza is that they feel it is necessary to exact a price from Hamas, and that this might be the only one that would prove to its followers and would-be followers that it has suffered a huge defeat, no matter how much it would try to twist the narrative that it had won the war somehow after it is over.

Hezbollah rockets hit UN bases in Lebanon	The peacekeeping force refrains from blaming Hezbollah, instead saying that 'non-state actors' were 'probably' behind the attacks. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Several Hezbollah rockets hit United Nations bases in Lebanon Tuesday during barrages aimed at Israel. At 9:50 AM, Arab-language IDF spokesman Avichai Adraee said, a failed launch among many fired at the Galilee hit a United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) post in the Ramiyeh region in southern Lebanon. The rocket had been fired from the area of Deir Aames, several kilometers north of the post, the IDF said after a careful review. UNIFIL reported that Post UNP-5-42 east of the village of Ramiyeh had been hit. Four Ghanaian solders had been lightly injured and the post had been damaged. Three of the troops were taken to hospital for treatment. UNIFIL was careful not to blame Hezbollah by name for the attack, announcing simply that the projectile was 'probably launched by non-state actors in Lebanon.' The force added that when one of its patrols passed a village called Khirbet Silim, also on Tuesday, an 'armed man' opened fire directly at the soldiers, again without providing an affiliation for the perpetrator. No soldier were injured in the incident. Hezbollah itself had no problem claiming responsibility for the rocket strike, but instead of admitting its projectile had fallen short, the terrorist group claimed that it had attacked a gathering of Israeli soldiers in the UNIFIL base, and were surprised to find out that they were instead Ghanaian troops. Another attack on the peacekeepers was recorded in the afternoon, Adraee said. 'Close to 1:30 PM, the UNIFIL post in the Shama area in southern Lebanon was hit as a result of a number of rockets launched by the terrorist organization Hezbollah from the al-Malkiyya area in southern Lebanon,' he said. According to the Italian defense ministry, its UNIFIL headquarters was struck by eight rockets. While UNIFIL said the attack damaged a maintenance workshop but injured no one, the Italian statement said that five troops were 'being monitored' in the base’s medical facility. Defense Minister Guido Crosetto had originally accused Israel of attacking the base, calling it 'intolerable,' but later the ministry walked back the charge. A source in the ministry told AFP that Crosetto 'did not have the right information' when he spoke, and that 'Hezbollah was responsible for the attack.' This was not the first time that Crosetto was quick to pull the trigger at Israel. Last week, he had also blamed Israel when an unexploded artillery shell landed in a UNIFIL base, with no damage or injuries caused. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani had joined the accusation, telling his Israeli counterpart, Gideon Sa’ar, that UNIFIL’s soldiers’ safety had to be ensured and that such attacks were 'unacceptable.' Sa’ar promised a 'immediate' investigation, and the IDF soon revealed that the shell had emanated from Hezbollah.

2/3 of Hezbollah’s arsenal originated in Russia – report	Israeli forces operating in Lebanon have reportedly revealed that the vast majority of Hezbollah's weapons are Russian-made, including some recently manufactured. By World Israel News Staff The vast majority of Hezbollah's weapons originated from Russia, according to a report Tuesday, with recent discoveries by Israeli soldiers operating in southern Lebanon forcing the IDF to raise its estimates regarding the flow of weapons to the Iranian-backed terror group. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal published a report citing multiple sources claiming that IDF forces operating in southern Lebanon since October 1st have uncovered large quantities of Russian-made weapons in Hezbollah's possession. While Israel has long been aware of the Iranian-backed terror group's use of Russian-made weapons, the recent discoveries reportedly came as a surprise to military intelligence, which had estimated that Hezbollah's arsenal was less dependent on Russia, and that the Russian-made equipment was largely older items, many dating to the Soviet era. In fact, however, Hezbollah's arsenal includes Russian weapons manufactured as recently as 2020, Syrian security officials and an Arab official told the Journal. Rather than being made up of antiquated weapons dating back before the collapse of the Berlin Wall, Israeli forces operating in Lebanon have found troves of modern advanced Russian weapons in Hezbollah caches, including antitank Kornet missiles. The discoveries have fueled fears among Israeli leaders that Russia is strengthening its ties to the Lebanese terror group, contradicting Moscow's claims of neutrality in conflicts between Israel and Iranian proxy groups. Israel's former Ambassador to Russia, Arkady Mil-Man, said that Israel 'needs to be more assertive and defend its interests' in talks with Russia. 'We must explain and convey to the Russians that we will no longer stand any assistance to Hezbollah and Iran that could hurt Israelis.' Moscow, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, and the Syrian foreign ministry all declined to respond to the report. According to an IDF major cited by the report, between 60% and 70% of the Hezbollah weapons seized early in Israel's invasion of southern Lebanon were of Russian origin.

$5 million and repatriation: Netanyahu’s rewards for hostage info	Netanyahu promises to 'bring back all of the hostages,' dangles cash reward for information leading to rescue. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged that those providing information leading to the rescue of the hostages would be rewarded with $5 million and safe passage out of the Gaza Strip, during a tour of the coastal enclave on Tuesday. Appealing to Gazans, Netanyahu said 'whoever brings us a hostage, will find a safe way out for himself and his family.' Netanyahu also stressed that Israel 'will also give a reward of $5 million for each hostage.' 'The choice is yours, but the result will be the same. We will bring them all back,' he added. Notably, from Netanyahu's statement, it appears that the offer stands regardless of whether the hostage is living or dead. The premier also vowed that terrorists who had murdered or assaulted captives would be caught and punished by Israel. 'Whoever dares to harm our hostages — their blood is on your head,' Netanyahu warned. 'We will pursue you, and we will find you.' Defense Minister Israel Katz accompanied Netanyahu on the tour of the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the Strip along a north-south line. Katz told soldiers stationed at the Corridor 'their most important mission' is to rescue the hostages who have been held in the Strp for more than 13 months. 'We also have to ensure that Hamas won’t rule here the day after' the conflict ends, Katz said. In October, an Israeli entrepreneur pledged to personally pay a $100,000 reward in cash or Bitcoin to Gazans who provide information leading to the recovery of living Israeli hostages still held in the Strip. Nearly a month after the offer was made by Daniel Birnbaum, the former CEO of SodaStream, it appears that no Gazans have taken him up on the offer. While some of the hostages were originally held by Gazan families in their homes, it is likely that all remaining hostages are in subterranean tunnels to thwart rescue attempts.

Anti-gov’t flare suspect: Reserve officer who encouraged refusals	Reserve officer who held rank of Rear Admiral in the Navy arrested for firing explosive projectile at Netanyahu's house during demonstration. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli court lifted a gag order on the names of the suspects arrested on Sunday for firing flares at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea, revealing their names publicly for the first time. They were named as Itai Yafeh, Amir Sadeh, and Ofer Doron. Yafeh and Sadeh are longtime leaders in the protest movement against the current government and Netanyahu. Doron held the rank of Rear Admiral in the Israeli Navy reserves, and was officially suspended from the reserves in August 2023. The former senior officer, who was responsible for a naval operational center, announced that he would no longer report to reserve duty due to the judicial reform legislation. In a public statement, Doron said he would refuse to serve 'a dictatorship,' and encouraged his fellow reservists to follow suit. The declaration caused the head of the Israeli Navy, Vice Adm. David Sa’ar Salama, to suspend Doron from the reserves. Shortly before the October 7th terror onslaught, tensions within Israeli society over the planned changes to the judicial system had reached an all-time high. Hebrew-language media widely reported that many reservists were refusing to show up for duty due to their opposition to the legislation, but it's unclear exactly how widespread the phenonmenon actually was. No data including the numbers of reservists who failed to report for training were released by the military. One Air Force official said at a conference that reserve pilots who shirked training as an act of political protest ha dnegatively impacted operational readinesss on October 7th. He was swiftly condemned by senior leadership and forced to retract his comments. Hamas officials have cited the chaotic anti-judicial overhaul protests, which saw demonstrators illegally block highways, the airprot, and major intesrections across the country, factored into the timing of when to launch the October 7th attack.

Despite Biden’s objections, Netanyahu said Israel ‘followed its o...	Netanyahu said Biden 'suggested that we not go in on the ground&#8230;he also said he would stop important arms shipments.' By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told lawmakers at the Knesset in Jerusalem on Monday that outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden’s advice on how to handle the wars with Iran and its terrorist proxies across the region was often incorrect, and that Jerusalem had opted to 'follow our own view.' Following Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border massacre from the Gaza Strip, Washington 'suggested that we not go in on the ground,' he said during a 40-signature debate, which opposition lawmakers can call once a month and in which the premier is legally obliged to participate. 'It said, ‘It can be handled from the air.’ It sent experts. We decided to follow our view and go in—a ground offensive,' claimed Netanyahu. The Biden administration had also opposed going into Gaza City and its Hamas-controlled Shifa Hospital, as well as into the terrorist strongholds of Khan Younis and Rafah in the southern Strip, according to the premier. Regarding Rafah, Biden said that if Jerusalem went in, it would stand alone, said Netanyahu. 'He also said he would stop important arms shipments. And so he did. A few days later, [U.S. Secretary of State Antony] Blinken appeared and repeated the same things. I told him in a broad forum: ‘Tony, if we have to, we’ll fight with our fingernails.'' In a separate closed-door meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee meeting on Monday, Netanyahu told legislators that the United States had estimated that 20,000 Palestinians would be killed in Rafah. 'That turned out to be a total fiction,' the premier said, per Channel 14. In September, the Israel Defense Forces told reporters during a visit to southern Gaza that an estimated 2,308 terrorist operatives were killed in Rafah, while more than 13 kilometers (8 miles) of Hamas tunnels were destroyed. Netanyahu stressed in his public Knesset address on Monday that the United States did come to Jerusalem’s assistance at the start of the war, when Biden and other officials paid wartime visits to the Jewish state. However, he continued, 'We must preserve Israel’s independence. We decided to enter—and we occupied Rafah, the Philadelphi Corridor and the Rafah Crossing.' 'We eliminated the organized [Hamas] battalions,' Netanyahu said. 'We destroyed a substantial part of Hamas’s military capabilities. We aren’t done yet, but we have come a long way. But we also have a goal of destroying Hamas’s governmental capacities. This is the next thing,' he continued. 'I requested that the IDF come up with an orderly plan to eradicate the governmental capacities, which is also related to restricting their ability to distribute food, to distribute humanitarian aid,' the premier said. Netanyahu also criticized the U.S. administration over its demands that the IDF refrain from retaliating against Iran for its unprecedented ballistic missile attacks on the Jewish state. 'Again, we were told by our friends, ‘there is no need to respond,’ ‘take the win,’ ‘be content with victory.’ I said, ‘This is not a victory.’ If they attack you, and, with God’s help, they didn’t kill anyone, if you don’t respond—that’s certainly not a victory. There must be a response. We responded. I won’t go into all the details, but we responded,' he said. Biden announced in July that he was dropping out of the Nov. 5 election, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for the White House. Earlier this month, Republican President-elect Donald Trump won a decisive victory, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226.

Jerusalem court orders Palestinian Authority to pay family of int...	According to March 2024 legislation, any entity rewarding terrorists in a 'pay-for-slay' program would pay $2.7 million for each person killed and $1.35 million for each person injured. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a historic decision, a Jerusalem court ordered the Palestinian Authority to pay 46 million shekel ($12.3 million) to families of victims of the Sbarro bombing during the intifada. The plaintiffs in the case are siblings of those killed in the 2001 terrorist bombing that took place in central Jerusalem and claimed the lives of 16 people. Among the casualties from the Sbarro's terror attack were five members of the Schijveschuurder family: Mordechai, 43; Tzira, 41; Ra'aya, 14; Yitzhak, 4; and Hemda, 2, including two adults and three children. Judge Arnon Darel has ruled on compensating the plaintiffs for the death of their three siblings; the damages for the death of their parents are still pending and are likely to be significant, given the psychological suffering and loss involved. Israel's Supreme Court had in the past identified the Palestinian Authority as responsible for terror attacks, and this ruling was updated in March 2024 with legislation that any entity rewarding terrorists in a 'pay-for-slay' program would pay $2.7 million for each person killed and $1.35 million for each person injured. Until this decision, no rulings were based on this legislation, and the Palestinian Authority does not acknowledge it as legitimate. The ruling is the first time a judge is implementing the law to allow terror victims' families to receive the compensation they are entitled to according to the legislation. In addition to the above-stated amounts, Judge Darel ordered the PA to pay additional damages, including pain and suffering, shortened life expectancy, and lost wages, which amounted to an additional $5.4 million, plus attorney fees. The plaintiffs' attorney, Dr. Asaf Posner, has requested that the money be paid to his clients from funds intended for the Palestinian Authority that Israel has frozen. Dr. Posner commented that the case was a significant first step, and he expressed hope that there would be additional victories awarding damages to terror victims' families.

Israel to back lifting US sanctions on Syria, Russia – report	Israel reportedly proposes deal under which Jerusalem would back lifting of US sanctions on Syria, in exchange for cutting off weapons supply to Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Israel has offered to help Syria secure the lifting of American sanctions on the Assad regime as part of a larger deal to distance Damascus from Iran and curb the flow of weapons to the Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, according to a report Tuesday. The Lebanon-based daily Al Jounhouria reported Tuesday that Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer recently proposed such a quid pro quo arrangement during a recent visit to Moscow. Under the alleged proposal, Israel would commit to working to secure the removal of some key American sanctions on the Assad regime in Syria, in exchange for the Assad government's agreement to actively work to prevent the transfer of weapons through Syrian territory to Hezbollah. Currently, a significant portion of Iranian weapons transfers to Hezbollah take place via several routes from Syria, including through the Qalamoun Mountains, through the Damascus-Beirut highway via the Bekaa Valley, as well as on ships and aircraft departing Syrian ports and airfields. The proposed deal would also ensure Russia's involvement in blocking the transfer of weapons via Syria to Hezbollah. Tuesday's report claimed that Dermer has vowed to lobby the Biden administration to suspend some sanctions against the Syrian government, as well as a number of Syrian and Russian companies. This is not the first time Israel has reportedly agreed to back the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria in exchange for assistance in blocking weapons transfers to Hezbollah. A similar proposal was made during the first Trump administration, fueling speculation that Trump's victory in the November 5th vote may be behind Israel's renewed interest in attempting such an arrangement.

7 injured in Hezbollah rocket attacks as US envoy arrives in Beir...	Amos Hochstein makes final push for ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah, as the Iran-backed terror group pounds northern Israel with rocket barrages. By World Israel News Staff At least seven people were injured in Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel on Tuesday morning, as the Iranian-backed terror group launched over two dozen rockets at Israeli towns. 'Following the sirens that sounded between 09:50 and 09:51 in the Upper Galilee, Western Galilee, and Central Galilee areas, approximately 25 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israel,' the IDF said. At least five of the rockets were launched towards central Israel, with ten more targeting the Upper Galilee, and the remaining ten launched towards the Central Galilee and Western Galilee. Most of the rockets were either intercepted or landed in open areas, the army said. One rocket which landed near a home in the northern town of Karmiel caused serious damage and injured five people. The victims, who include a 70-year-old woman, were wounded by glass shards following the rocket's explosion. All five victims are listed in light condition. Two others were lightly injured in a rocket attack on the coastal city of Netanya. Emergency rescue teams from United Hatzalah and Magen David Adom (MDA) were dispatched to the scene to treat the victims and evacuate them to local hospitals. Later Tuesday morning, warning sirens were sounded in the Galilee after multiple drone aircraft were spotted entering Israeli airspace from Lebanon. IDF forces shot down both of the drone aircraft, an army spokesperson said. The attacks come as Biden administration envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut Tuesday morning for talks with Lebanese officials, as part of a final bid by the Biden White House to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Hochstein is reportedly hoping to secure final backing by Lebanon on a framework, before traveling to Israel to present the updated demands of the Lebanese government and Hezbollah. On Monday, it was reported that the Lebanese government had largely accepted the American proposal, though Beirut had responded with a list of requested changes and 'clarifications' for some provisions of the draft agreement, in particular those relating to Israel's right to respond military in Lebanon to violations of the ceasefire.

Hamas hijacks over 100 aid trucks over the weekend	A whopping 113 trucks were looted of their humanitarian supplies in the Gaza Strip in two takeovers. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hamas operatives stole tons of humanitarian aid being brought into the Gaza Strip over the weekend, looting almost 100 trucks on Saturday and another 15 on Sunday. United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the Saturday raid was the worst case of looting in Gaza 'in terms of volume' since the Israel-Hamas war began 13 months ago. Louise Wateridge, the Senior Emergency Officer of the UN’s aid agency exclusive to Palestinians, UNRWA, said that Israel had told the joint UNRWA-World Food Program convoy to enter southern Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing 'at short notice and via an unfamiliar route,' Reuters reported. Drivers of 98 trucks out of the 109 in the convoy were soon forced at gunpoint to take down their cargo, Wateridge said, adding that some of them were injured in the process. Dujarric added that the hijackers had caused 'severe damage to the trucks' while stealing the supplies Eyewitnesses said that the convoy had been stopped by masked men throwing grenades. Neither Wateridge nor Dujarric would identify the perpetrators as Hamas personnel when commenting on the incident, although Israel has provided proof that Hamas has warehouses so full of stolen aid that they don’t know where to put it all. In a press conference Monday, UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini actually turned the blame away from Hamas. 'Until four or five months ago, we still had local capacity, people who were escorting the convoy,' he said. 'This has completely gone, which means we are in an environment where local gangs, local families, are struggling among each other to take control of any business or any activities taking place in the south. It has become an impossible environment to operate in.' In a post on X, the international organization also accused Israel of bearing ultimate responsibility, stating that the Jewish state is continuing to 'disregard their legal obligations under international law to ensure the population's basic needs are met and to facilitate the safe delivery of aid.' In Sunday’s incident, about 15 trucks were looted in the Gaza Strip by armed men. The IDF fired at others who tried to loot more trucks and thwarted their attempt, a Ynet report stated Monday. The report also said that government officials have instructed the security establishment to intensify operations against looters. The IDF knows which points and intersections are most popular for the hijackings, the report said, and is increasing its forces at those critical points in order to ensure that the aid will reaches its destination intact. Hamas, meanwhile, claimed that it had 'executed' 20 thieves who were allegedly members of a crime ring as 'part of an integrated plan to combat the crime of robbing aid trucks.' Many in Israel think the IDF should take over the entire aid distribution process so as to weaken Hamas’ hold on the Gazan population that is currently dependent on the terrorist group for its basic needs. This would also cut off a huge money-maker for the terrorists, as Hamas has made hundreds of millions of dollars selling the aid they steal.

Russia deploying army forces on Israeli border	Russian military reportedly taking up positions along Israel's northern border along the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Russia's military has deployed ground forces along the Israeli border, Syria has claimed, establishing a number of 'observation points' opposite the Israeli frontier. On Monday, Syrian state media outlet SANA reported that the Russian army is expanding its presence in southwestern Syria, and that Russian forces are establishing nine observation points on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, adjacent to the Israeli border in the Quneitra area, and along the Jordanian frontier outside Daraa. Deputy Commander of the Russian forces operating in Syria, General Alexander Rodionov, said in a press statement that the new deployment was part of the Russian army's existing mission in Syria. 'The forces, in coordination with the Syrian Arab Army, established nine observation points along the disengagement force zone, whose mission is to carry out surveillance operations by air and land,' Rodionov said. 'Everything that is reported in some media outlets other than that is false,' Rodionov continued, denying claims that Russian forces had been withdrawn from Syria and that the deployments along the Israeli frontier were part of a new mission in Syria. Rodionov noted that Russian forces have been deployed to Syria since 2015, and arrived at the request of the Bashar Assad regime. Russian forces were dispatched to Syria, beginning in September 2015, to bolster the Assad government during the Syrian civil war, with the declared aim of combating Islamist groups, including the Islamic State in Syria (ISIS) organization. A Syrian army officer whose identity was not disclosed told SANA that Russia's deployment near the Israeli border 'increases stability and security,' and 'helps residents return to their land and lead their normal lives in their villages after being liberated from terrorism.'

Israeli security chief secretly visits Turkey in bid to reboot ho...	Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar reportedly visited Turkey, meeting with his Turkish counterpart in an effort to pressure Hamas to return to the negotiating table. By World Israel News Staff The head of Israel's internal security agency made a clandestine trip to Turkey over the weekend, Israeli media outlets reported Tuesday, in an effort to reboot hostage and ceasefire deal talks with Hamas. According to reports by Walla and Yedioth Aharanoth on Tuesday morning, Ronen Bar, director of the Shin Bet agency, flew to Turkey over the weekend to meet with Ibrahim Kalin, head of Turkish intelligence agency Millî İstihbarat Teşkilatı (MIT). The meeting came after Hamas' senior leaders were forced to relocate from Doha, Qatar, where they had been hosted for a decade, to Turkey. An Israeli official speaking on condition of anonymity was cited by Yedioth Aharanoth as saying that Bar's trip to Turkey was part of a larger Israeli effort to encourage foreign powers to exert pressure on Hamas to return to the negotiating table and to compromise on its long-standing demands. Israel is not seeking, the official added, to bring in Ankara to replace Doha as primary mediator in the hostage deal talks. Instead, Egypt, which has hitherto served in a lesser capacity to facilitate talks, is expected to become the primary interlocuter. At least one Turkish diplomat downplayed claims that Turkey has become the permanent host of Hamas' leadership, saying the presence of senior Hamas members in the country was temporary. 'Members of Hamas' political branch visit Turkey from time to time. Claims that Hamas moved its offices to Turkey do not reflect reality,' the official said, according to Yedioth Aharanoth. Turkish-Israeli relations have grown increasingly hostile since Hamas' October 7th, 2023 invasion of Israel, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's hostile rhetoric towards Israel and its war against Hamas. Over the weekend, Azerbaijani media outlets reported that Turkey had refused to grant safe passage to Israeli President Isaac Herzog's plane en route to the COP29 climate change conference in Baku.

‘A boom, and everything went black’ – Hezbollah missile victim	It was a miracle I survived,' Eran Lanksy said. 'The store was completely destroyed.' By World Israel News Staff A man who was seriously wounded by a Hezbollah ballistic missile strike in central Israel on Monday evening is speaking out about the explosion that nearly killed him. Eran Lanksy, the proprietor of a men's clothing store in Ramat Gan, a Tel Aviv suburb, told Hebrew-language outlet Walla his family had been in the shop helping him just minutes before the impact. 'My family left and five minutes later a siren sounded,' Lansky recounted. 'There were two smaller explosions, than a third one. It looked as if everything in the shop was flying around in front of me, and I was thrown about ten meters. There was a crazy boom and everything went black.' Doctors said that Lansky suffered a brain hemorrhage, along with some internal bleeding in his shoulder area. 'It was a miracle I survived,' Lanksy said. 'The store was completely destroyed.' Five other people were wounded in the blast and are hospitalized in moderate condition. Notably, the IDF spokesman, the police, and local officials have released contradictory statements about the source of the explosion. The IDF and Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shama-HaCohen claimed that the blast and subsequent fires were caused by shrapnel from the Iron Dome's in-air interception of the missile. 'A preliminary investigation found that the interceptor missile struck hit a surface-to-surface missile launched from Lebanon at a high altitude, and broke it into several pieces. As a result of the interception, part of the missile hit the ground and caused damage and casualties. The incident is being investigated,' the IDF said. However, the Central District Commander of the Israeli police said he believed that the missile had directly impacted in central Israel. Footage from the scene circulating on social media showed widespread damage to nearby office buildings and apartments, with buses and cars set ablaze.

Hamas publicly executes alleged humanitarian aid thieves	Hamas brags about 'field executions' of men accused of stealing aid; terror group regularly seizes and stockpiles aid, preventing basic goods from reaching Gazan civilians. By World Israel News Staff Members of the Hamas terror group executed 20 Gazan civilians who they claimed were stealing humanitarian aid, claiming that the brutal murders were part of a 'security operation' targeting the theft of sought-after goods. Hamas regularly seizes and hoards humanitarian aid provided by Israel and the international community, stockpiling the goods in warehouses guarded by armed terrorists and charging Gazan civilians exorbitant prices for basic necessities. Video from the incident circulating on social media showed Hamas firing an RPG at a vehicle carrying several men, who they claimed had commandeered an aid truck. Some 20 people, whom Hamas claimed were members of an organized crime ring that stole from trucks carrying goods, were killed. In a media statement, Hamas acknowledged that it had killed the alleged thieves without arresting them or putting them on trial. 'The field executions of thieves are part of an integrated plan to combat the crime of robbing aid trucks,' Hamas said in a press release. 'We will continue to pursue lawbreakers and thieves who steal the food of our Palestinian people.' It's unclear if the slayings will result in lower prices for Gazans seeking to purchase basic goods. In April 2024, a Palestinian Authority-controlled news station reported that Hamas murdered workers who were providing humanitarian aid to Gazan civilians. 'Hamas’ persecution of any party who is a source for distributing the [humanitarian] aid or securing it began from the start of the war, as Hamas persecuted well-known figures and teams of volunteers on the ground in mid-October [2023],' a Fatah TV journalist said during a broadcast. Hamas 'attacked them and killed some of them…to ensure Hamas control over the aid and its storage, which of course leads to these crazy and unreal prices that no one can pay in the shadow of this destruction.'

Iraq ‘terrified’ by potential Israeli attack on local Iranian pro...	The idea that Iraqi territory could be used for a major attack Israel 'caused a lot of noise and resentment in Iraq,' says researcher. By World Israel News Staff Iraqi officials are 'highly concerned' about Israel potentially striking the country, after reports indicated that Jerusalem would no longer tolerate ongoing explosive drone launches from Iraqi territory. Since October 7th, Shia militias in Iraq, funded by Iran, have fired hundreds of drones at Israel, with some striking the Golan Heights and Jordan Valley regions, along with the southern port city of Eilat. Several of those impacts have killed Israeli soldiers stationed near the northern Lebanon border. While Israel has so far refrained from launching retaliatory strikes on Iraq, a recent report indicating that Iran may use its Iraqi proxies as part of a widespread attack against Israel has raised fears in the country. 'Everyone is terribly afraid of an Israeli response will come against Iraq,' Dr. Ronen Zeidel, an expert on modern Iraq and researchers at Tel Aviv Univeristy, told Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv. When international media reports suggested that Iran was gearing up to launch ballistic and cruise missiles stored on Iraqi territory, pressure for local militias to step back from the conflict increased. The idea that Iraqi territory could be used for a major attack Israel 'caused a lot of noise and resentment in Iraq, along with strong pressure' on the proxy groups not to cooperate with Iran, Zeidel said. Iraqi officials told the Iranians that they should 'not even think' about leveraging Iraqi territory for the attack on Israel, the professor said. 'The Iraqis were very stressed about this matter. They told the Iranians, 'Listen, do whatever you want from Iranian territory.' It seems that the possibility of Iranian military activity from Iraqi territory has been dropped from the agenda for now.' According to Zeidel, American pressure has also been effective at reining n the Iraqi militias. Washington reportedly told the groups that should they participate in a large-scale Iranian attack against Israel, the U.S. would be unable to stop a severe response from Israel.

Netanyahu says openly that Israel struck a ‘specific component’ i...	The Israeli attack on Iran in late October destroyed an active top secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin. By Reuters and Algemeiner Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel‘s air attack on Iran last month hit an element of Tehran’s nuclear program while degrading its defense and missile production capabilities. 'It’s not a secret,' Netanyahu said in a speech in parliament. 'There is a specific component in their nuclear program that was hit in this attack.' He did not identify the component, but added that Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon had not been blocked. Netanyahu’s comments came three days after the Axios news website reported that the Israeli attack on Iran in late October destroyed an active top secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin, citing three US officials, one current Israeli official, and one former Israeli official. On Oct. 26, Israeli fighter jets carried out three waves of attacks on Iranian military targets, a few weeks after Iran had fired a barrage of about 200 ballistic missiles against Israel. This followed a previous exchange of direct attacks in April. Netanyahu, in his speech, offered a few more details on what Israel had targeted. Israel‘s April strike, he said, was narrower, taking out one of four Russian-supplied S-300 surface-to-air missile defense batteries around Tehran, the Iranian capital. He said that in October, Israel destroyed the remaining three batteries and caused serious damage to Iran’s ballistic missile production capabilities and its ability to produce solid fuel, which is used in long-range ballistic missiles.

Hezbollah missiles injure 5 people in central Israel	Central Israel is on fire because of Hezbollah’s indiscriminate rocket fire,' the Israel Defense Forces stated. By JNS Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorists fired a missile from Lebanon toward Israel’s densely populated central region on Monday night, wounding five people—one of them seriously injured. 'Central Israel is on fire because of Hezbollah’s indiscriminate rocket fire,' the Israel Defense Forces stated. A 54-year-old woman was listed as being in serious condition. The four others sustained moderate and light wounds, stated Magen David Adom, an emergency response group. First responders reportedly evacuated all five victims to Rabin Medical Center’s Beilinson Hospital in Petach Tikvah. 'Following the alerts that were activated a short time ago in the center of the country, the Air Force intercepted one launch,' which crossed into Israel from Lebanon, the IDF stated. 'A fall was detected, apparently originating from interception fragments.' Missile alerts were activated throughout the larger Tel Aviv metropolitan area and the country’s coastal plain, sending millions running for shelter, according to the army’s Home Front Command. Israel Hayom reported that a projectile fell and caused a fire outside the Azrieli Ayalon Mall in Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv. 'Police forces are working to isolate the impact scenes and evacuate the wounded. We ask the public to stay away from impact sites and obey instructions of police officers,' the Israel Police stated. The municipality of Bnei Brak, which borders Ramat Gan, stated that Ben Gurion Street had been closed to traffic due to glass fragments on the road. It called on the public to avoid the area. Take-offs and landings were briefly suspended at Tel Aviv’s Ben-Gurion International Airport amid the Hezbollah attack, per local media. 'Israel is under attack by Iran-backed terrorist groups hellbent on murdering Israelis and destroying the Jewish state,' AIPAC stated. 'America must stand with Israel and ensure our ally has the weapons it needs to fight and win this war.' 'Hezbollah missile attack makes direct hit in Ramat Gan right near our office where we were holding a post-U.S. election victory party. The party like the election was a big success,' wrote Marc Zell, vice president of Republicans Overseas and chair of Republicans Overseas Israel. ' At the same time as the missile attack on Tel Aviv, the Israeli Air Force stated that it shot down a Hezbollah suicide drone launched at the Haifa area. Earlier on Monday evening, an Israeli civilian was killed and 10 were lightly wounded when a Hezbollah rocket hit a three-story building in the northern Arab city of Shfar’am.

Israel, fresh off a draw with France, stuns Belgium 1-0	Belgium is ranked 6th in the latest FIFA men’s world rankings, while Israel is ranked 81st. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israel scored a stunning 1-0 soccer win over European powerhouse Belgium in Budapest on Sunday, but it was not enough to avoid relegation from the UEFA Nations League’s top tier. The Blue and White finished fourth in the League A Group 2 standings, despite the impressive defeat of Belgium off the foot of Yarden Shua in the 86th minute to break the deadlock. Israel needed two more goals to relegate the Red Devils instead. Belgium is ranked 6th in the latest FIFA men’s world rankings, while Israel is ranked 81st.

Israel tied the latter 0-0 on Nov. 14, in a tense match played at the Stade de France that was marred by minor violence in the stands and outside the venue amid Israel’s war against Iranian-backed terrorist groups in Gaza and Lebanon. The match, held in the heavily Muslim suburb of Saint-Denis north of Paris, came a week after mass assaults by Muslims on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam following a match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax. Sunday’s match was played at the Hungarian pitch of Bozsik Aréna, and was technically a home game for the Israelis because of the war. Only 675 fans attended the match at the 8,200-capacity facility. The game was played in dense fog.

Exit polls show Harris made big mistake passing over Pennsylvania...	Shapiro, a practicing Jew and a popular governor known for his charismatic speaking style, had established himself as a fierce defender of Israel and Jewish interests. By Jewish Breaking News Kamala Harris’s decision to pass over Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro for her vice presidential slot proved to be a critical miscalculation, with exit polling data revealing the choice significantly dampened her support among Jewish voters. According to a survey conducted by the Honan Strategy Group for the Teach Coalition, Harris could have secured a commanding 53% to 38% margin among Pennsylvania’s Jewish voters had she selected Shapiro instead of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Instead, the Harris-Walz ticket managed only a modest 48% to 41% advantage of the Jewish vote. Shapiro, a practicing Jew and popular governor known for his charismatic speaking style, had established himself as a fierce defender of Israel and Jewish interests. He notably condemned anti-Israel campus protesters, comparing such demonstrations to 'people dressed up in KKK outfits or KKK regalia' in a CNN interview. Following Hamas’s October 7 attack, Shapiro took decisive action, delivering speeches at local synagogues, issuing strong condemnations of the terrorist group, and ordering flags to fly at half-mast at the state capitol. Then-Republican nominee Donald Trump seized on the controversy, suggesting Harris blocked Shapiro from the ticket because of his Jewish faith, arguing she feared losing Muslim voters in swing states like Michigan amid heightened focus on the Gaza war. While Shapiro himself defended Harris against accusations of antisemitism, the campaign never fully recovered from perceptions that she was soft on antisemitism and an unreliable ally of Israel. Though some political observers attributed Harris’s decision to concerns about Shapiro’s ambition and the possibility of being overshadowed by her running mate, numbers don’t lie and perhaps Pennsylvania would have swung her way had she stuck with the right choice rather than conceding to Hamas sympathizers.

Argentina seizes trove of Nazi memorabilia as part of internation...	They seized over 60 firearms from a home, including 43 rifles with Nazi eagle markings, pistols, bayonets and machine guns, and arrested a man. By Juan Melamed, JTA Police in Argentina have seized a trove of Nazi weapons and memorabilia, including dozens of guns, uniforms and busts of Hitler, in their latest discovery of Nazi relics in a country that gave refuge to Nazi leaders. The federal police’s anti-mafia division uncovered the items during a raid Friday in Quilmes, a city near Buenos Aires. They seized over 60 firearms from a home, including 43 rifles with Nazi eagle markings, pistols, bayonets and machine guns, and arrested a man. The name of the detained was not disclosed and an investigation is ongoing. According to the Ministry of Security, the investigation was made together with the police of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as part of an investigation into international weapons trafficking. Argentina’s national security minister, Patricia Bullrich, said the country had seized 'weapons and parts from a dark and tragic era of humanity.' Argentina has had an anti-discrimination law on the books since 1988 that criminalizes trafficking in such objects. Professionals from the Holocaust Museum of Buenos Aires participated in the raid and confirmed that the objects violated the law, according to local reports. Argentina was a refuge for Nazis after World War II. Adolf Eichmann was captured in the northern area of Buenos Aires in 1960. Nazi war criminals Joseph Mengele and Erich Priebke also made their way to Argentina. In October 2018 Argentina’s Jewish political umbrella organization revealed excerpts from tens of thousands of documents about World War II that shed light on the Nazi influence on the country and the Nazi war criminals who hid here. Meanwhile, Nazi relics — and items forged by their admirers — have continued to circulate. In June 2016, a collector from Argentina paid $680,000 for Nazi underpants and other memorabilia. T he following year, investigators announced the seizure of 75 items, including those seemingly used in medical experiments; most were later revealed to be forgeries. Last year, police raided and closed a publisher that was distributing Nazi literature.

Hezbollah rocket hits Israeli Arab city, killing woman	Earlier on Monday, a 65-year-old woman was lightly wounded by shrapnel from a Hezbollah rocket attack on Israel’s Galilee, and a 34-year-old man was lightly injured in another barrage less than two hours later. By JNS One Israeli was killed on Monday and five others were wounded when a Hezbollah terrorist rocket fired from Lebanon scored a direct hit on a building in the northern Arab city of Shfar’am, medical officials said. The Magen David Adom medical emergency response group initially reported that one woman was seriously wounded after being trapped, while five others sustained light wounds in the attack on the structure. The Israel Fire and Rescue Authority said multiple rescue teams were deployed to the three-story building to search for additional victims. According to the Israel Defense Forces, five projectiles were launched as part of the barrage. 'Interception attempts were made. Impacts have been detected,' the military announced in a post on social media. 6 פצועים בשתי זירות נפילה בשפרעם, בהם פצועה באורח אנוש@CBeyar pic.twitter.com/myiO0rMB0X &mdash; כאן חדשות (@kann_news) November 18, 2024 Earlier on Monday, a 65-year-old woman was lightly wounded by shrapnel from a Hezbollah rocket attack on Israel’s Galilee. A 34-year-old man was lightly injured in another barrage less than two hours later. According to Magen David Adom, the woman was treated on the scene before being evacuated to Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya along with another person suffering from anxiety. The injured man was also transported to the same hospital, according to MDA, which said he suffered from 'blast injuries.' Hezbollah launched 30 rockets at the Upper and Western Galilee areas in the attack that injured the woman, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Some of the projectiles were intercepted, while the rest fell in open areas, the military said. בהמשך להתרעות שהופעלו לפני זמן קצר במרחבים הגליל העליון והגליל המערבי, זוהו כ-30 שיגורים שחצו משטח לבנון, חלקם יורטו והיתר נפלו בשטחים פתוחים &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 18, 2024 Sirens continued to sound in northern Israel in the late morning and early afternoon hours, including in Arab al-Aramshe, Misgav Am, Margaliot and Kiryat Shmona. Seventy-six people in northern Israel have been killed by Hezbollah cross-border rocket, missile and drone attacks since the start of the war, including 31 soldiers and six foreign citizens, according to the latest data provided by the Prime Minister’s Office, updated on Sunday. In addition, 729 people have been wounded, including 497 civilians and 232 soldiers. Of these, 29 civilians and 37 soldiers were severely injured; 63 civilians and 38 soldiers were moderately injured and 405 civilians and 157 soldiers were mildly injured. Dozens of Hezbollah launchers, rockets, weapons destroyed IDF forces operating in Southern Lebanon have located and destroyed dozens of multi-barrel launches, mortars, rocket caches and military equipment used in Hezbollah’s attacks against Israel over the past year, the military said on Monday. The IDF highlighted the work of troops from the 226th Reserve Brigade, operating under the command of the 146th Division, in finding these launchers both above and below ground. Troops also discovered and dismantled what the IDF said was an extensive underground terrorist facility, including weapons stockpiles, living quarters and a fully equipped and stocked kitchen. Also found at the site were 'combat equipment and operational maps, detailing Israeli settlements, ranges and plans, all ready for action,' according to the military. 'The troops are continuing to locate and dismantle terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon that Hezbollah used to plan and execute attacks against Israel.' Lebanese official: 90-95% of Dahieh residents evacuated A municipal leader from the Beirut area said on Monday that 90-95% of residents in the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahieh south of the capital have evacuated due to warnings from Israel’s military, Ynet reported. The Lebanese official added that significant destruction to the district has been reported, surpassing the damage seen during the month-long Second Lebanon War in 2006. Israel has been waging a devastating aerial campaign against Hezbollah throughout Lebanon, including its stronghold of Dahieh south of Beirut. According to Israeli estimates, the terror group has lost most of its arsenal to the ongoing strikes. Then-defense minister Yoav Gallant said in late October that Hezbollah is estimated to have lost over 80% of its long-range rockets since the start of the war. The IDF said on Nov. 12 that most of Hezbollah’s weapons storage sites and missile production facilities in Dahieh have been destroyed during the war, erasing two decades of buildup.

In historic first, female combat soldiers deployed in Lebanon	Their roles included intelligence gathering, identifying terrorist threats, and directing fire for ground and air forces. By Vered Weiss The IDF deployed female combat soldiers into Lebanon for the first time, The Jerusalem Post reports. Northern Command chief Maj.-Gen. Ori Gordin approved the deployment several weeks ago. The women served as members of a combat intelligence team stationed near the Syrian border in the Mount Dov region. Their roles included intelligence gathering, identifying terrorist threats, and directing fire for ground and air forces. The Jerusalem Post interviewed several female soldiers, including Corporal Tehila, 21, from the Eit Battalion. 'Southern Lebanon? We went in on foot. How much weight did we carry? Too much,' she said with a laugh. 'Around 40% of our body weight. We were preparing for a long ambush.' Corporal Shani, 20, described the mission in detail, 'We walked about 1.5 kilometers into Lebanon, established a position in the field, maintained camouflage, and began intelligence collection using observation tools. Operationally, we entered areas untouched by Israeli forces since the Second Lebanon War.' The soldiers provided valuable intelligence, including locating key terrorists hiding in buildings and details about anti-tank missile sites. The soldiers described how they guided an operation based on photographs that provided precise information about crucial locations and targets. In addition, their images allowed other soldiers to find weapons that were embedded within civilian areas. The team was behind enemy lines for 24 hours close to a location known to have a high concentration of Hezbollah terrorists. A fire broke out in the area and forced their evacuation. The soldiers focused mainly on concealing their positions and gathering intelligence, which provided a significant challenge. During the Israeli airstrike on Iran, four female pilots played a pivotal role in assisting the IAF in hitting crucial targets. The operation involved F-15 and F-16 fighter jets departing from Israel, and four female navigators from the Israeli Air Force (IAF) played a pivotal role in the historic mission.

Diamond Fraud Under the Microscope: Israeli Tech Promises Market ...	Rabinovich leveraged advanced spectroscopy and imaging techniques to identify subtle differences in diamond structure. By Pesach Benson, TPS A groundbreaking patent by a professor at Israel’s Ariel University promises to revolutionize the diamond industry by offering a reliable and cost-effective method for distinguishing between natural and synthetic diamonds. This innovation comes at a crucial time, as the market is increasingly flooded with synthetic diamonds whose lower prices pose significant challenges to the traditional gemstone sector. The commercial importance of this development lies in its ability to address a pressing industry need. Synthetic diamonds, produced in laboratories through advanced techniques like High Pressure, High Temperature (HPHT) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), have seen a dramatic rise in popularity, costing 20-40% less than natural diamonds. However, this affordability has disrupted the market, increasing demand for a dependable system to verify the origin of diamonds. The patented technology was developed by Dr. Yossi Rabinovitch as part of his doctoral thesis at Ariel University. Rabinovich leveraged advanced spectroscopy and imaging techniques to identify subtle differences in diamond structure. By analyzing fluorescence patterns under UV light or atomic-level variations through laser-based methods, Rabinovitch’s system can quickly and accurately determine a diamond’s origin. Unlike existing methods, this innovation offers a more affordable solution, making it accessible to a broader range of jewelers and gemologists. Visually, natural and synthethic diamonds are identical to the naked eye. Natural diamonds are formed deep within the Earth’s mantle over billions of years under extreme pressure and heat. This slow process creates unique inclusions and imperfections that serve as geological fingerprints. In contrast, synthetic diamonds are grown in controlled lab environments within weeks. While they share the same chemical composition and crystalline structure as natural diamonds, they often exhibit distinctive growth patterns and fewer imperfections. According to the 'Synthetic Diamonds – Global Strategic Business Report' released in October, the global market for synthetic diamonds is projected to reach $21.4 billion in 2030, compared to $15.3 billion in 2023. They are increasingly being used in electronics, optical, and cutting tool industries. Researchers are also exploring the use of nanodiamonds in the fields of medicine, aerospace, automobiles and electronics. However, criminals have also taken advantage of synthetic diamonds. In December 2023, police in Hong Kong arrested four people who exported synthetic diamonds to India with fictitious paperwork declaring them to be natural diamonds. The synthetic diamonds were the centerpiece of a $64 million money laundering scheme.

Israel will not allow Hamas to govern Gaza again, Netanyahu vows	Netanyahu reportedly said he ordered officials to prepare a plan aimed at replacing Hamas in the distribution of humanitarian aid by Nov. 21. By JNS Hamas continues to frustrate ongoing hostages-for-ceasefire negotiations in the hopes of ending the war and returning to power in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday. 'The only thing that Hamas wants is a deal that ends the war and for the IDF to leave the Strip in order to return to power,' the premier said, according to Walla. 'I am not ready to allow that under any circumstance.' Netanyahu told lawmakers that the Palestinian terrorist group 'sees the pressure' put on his government in both the domestic and international spheres, and believes it can thwart the talks to secure better conditions. The prime minister said during the closed-door meeting that he believes some 50 out of the 101 remaining hostages held by Hamas remain alive. He told committee members that while there is currently no concrete proposal on the table, various 'ideas have come up' in recent days. The Qatari-owned Al-Araby Al-Jadeed outlet cited a Hamas source as saying earlier this week that the Islamist organization’s leadership has cut all contact with those actually holding the hostages, due to 'strict security measures to protect the important negotiation card.' The source added that Hamas has refused to provide information on the whereabouts and status of the hostages, in particular those with U.S. citizenship, as it has not been offered 'compensation' by mediators. According to Channel 12, Netanyahu noted on Monday that while the Israel Defense Forces operation in Gaza has destroyed most of Hamas’s 'military' infrastructure, its ruling capabilities remain largely intact. Netanyahu reportedly said he ordered officials to prepare a plan aimed at replacing Hamas in the distribution of humanitarian aid by Nov. 21. Also on Monday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who leads the Religious Zionism Party, told reporters that the IDF should occupy the entire northern part of the Strip until the hostages are released. Jerusalem needs to 'inform Hamas in clear terms that if the hostages do not return, we exercise our sovereignty and stay there forever,' he said, adding, 'Then, Hamas will have the motivation to keep them alive.' Roughly 1,200 Israeli Jews were murdered by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, thousands more were wounded and 251 others were taken into the Gaza Strip. On-and-off indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have dragged on for months, with the U.S., Egypt and Qatar acting as intermediaries. The return of the hostages still held by Hamas terrorists after 409 days remains the 'most important value goal' in the ongoing war, Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated in a statement on Sunday.

Report: Lebanon accepts US ceasefire deal disarming Hezbollah	Hezbollah reportedly sending its response to an American ceasefire proposal which would require the terror group be demilitarized and Israel given the right to retaliate in Lebanon for any ceasefire violations. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The government of Lebanon has accepted the United States proposal for a ceasefire between Israel and the Hezbollah terrorist group, according to a report Sunday, while Hezbollah has sent its official response to the peace plan. Late Sunday night, Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International (LBCI) reported that Beirut has accepted, with some caveats, the framework for a truce submitted by the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon, and that the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group Hezbollah has already penned a response, which is being forwarded to the United States. The report stated that while Lebanon has accepted the general outline of the ceasefire proposal, Beirut has asked for clarifications regarding some provisions and is pushing for alterations to others. In particular, Lebanon is seeking greater steps to limit Israel's ability to operate in Lebanese territory should the ceasefire be violated. According to the Saudi-based Asharq al-Awsat daily, Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri - a member of the Amal Shi'ite nationalist movement - is serving as interlocuter between Biden administration envoy Amos Hochstein and Hezbollah. Hochstein is set to visit Beirut on Tuesday in a bid to push forward with a ceasefire deal. According to a report Monday morning by Lebanon's Nidaa al-Watan outlet, the American ceasefire proposal centers around three main points. First, the Hezbollah terror group would be required to demilitarize - not only south of the Litani River, near the Israeli frontier, but also north of it. This provision, the report said, is considered non-negotiable by the U.S., due in part to Israeli insistence on the disarming of the Iran-backed proxy group. In addition, the draft submitted to Lebanon calls for the establishment of a supervisory committee to oversee the implementation of the ceasefire, to ensure adherence to the deal and monitory violations, and to ensure the fulfillment of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. The August 11th, 2006 resolution calls for the disarming of Hezbollah and removal of Hezbollah forces from south of the Litani River, and the cessation of fighting along the Israeli-Lebanese frontier. The proposed committee would be led by an American military officer, who would be joined by a French counterpart. Furthermore, the American proposal would back Israel's demand for a right to respond militarily in Lebanon should the ceasefire be violated, but only after the aforementioned committee is given an opportunity to reestablish calm.

‘Anarchist AG declared war on the government’ – Officials	Attorney General's inaction in the face of violent left-wing protests has caused 'unprecedented damage to the rule of law and public order,' says minister. By World Israel News Government ministers and other coalition lawmakers are raising the alarm about what they say is the illegal intervention of Attorney General Gali Baharav Miara in government matters, with many calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fire her. The demand for Baharav Miara's ouster comes on the heels of a recent decision from her office that Public Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir - whose ministry includes Israel's police - does not have the right to dictate police policies, nor replace the head of the police. Netanyahu should fire Ben Gvir if he does not stop attempting to change police policy and appointing senior figures within the force, Baharav Miara wrote. In response, Ben Gvir said on Monday that Baharav Miara 'has declared war on the government.' 'Pay attention, my fellow ministers, to what they are asking the prime minister to fire me for: because I backed our soldiers, because I spoke out against [Arab Joint List MKs] Ahmad Tibi and Ofer Cassif, because I criticized the courts,' Ben Gvir said. Baharav Miara is 'essentially the most dangerous person to the State of Israel,' Regional Cooperation Minister David Amsalem told Hebrew-language news site Kikar HaShabbat. The minister referenced ongoing incitement against Netanyahu, including an incident on Saturday night which saw anti-government demonstrators fire flares at the premier's residence, sparking a fire. 'She allows the left to run wild, to do whatever it wants,' Amsalem added. Communications Minister Dr. Shlomi Karhi noted that Baharav Miara had not clamped down on increasingly intense incitement against Netanyahu, and that her negligence could potentially lead to the prime minister's murder. 'The attorney general must go home today,' Karhi said in the Knesset plenum. 'If someone comes to kill you — including through weakness and agreement through silence — rise up and fire them,' he said, referencing a Talmudic self-defense ruling which says one should kill an aggressor in self-defense. Diaspora Miniter Amichai Chikli wrote on social media platform X that Baharav Miara's inaction in the face of violent left-wing protests has caused 'unprecedented damage to the rule of law and public order.' Chikli added that 'in her serial disregard of wild incitement, she is a silent accomplice. The State of Israel cannot afford to have an anarchist in the post of legal adviser.'

Hunting Jews in broad daylight: Europe’s new reality	Daniel Levy, a lifelong resident of Amsterdam, says ‘What we’re facing is far more than harassment—it’s a full-blown pogrom.’ By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News Amsterdam, a city that once symbolized tolerance and freedom, is now a battleground where Jews are hunted in the streets, targeted by violent mobs, and abandoned by their own government. Let’s call this what it is: a pogrom. The Jewish community is under siege, and the world is silent. This isn’t just neglect—it’s complicity. At Paradiso, one of Amsterdam’s most iconic concert venues, the depths of antisemitism were on full display. On November 12, 2024, a performer praised the so-called '#Jodenjacht'—a reference to the violent targeting of Jews—while the audience responded with enthusiastic applause. A room filled with cheers for a modern-day 'Jew hunt.' This chilling moment encapsulates the normalization of antisemitic violence in Europe and signals the breakdown of any pretense of safety for Jews in Amsterdam. Daniel Levy, a lifelong resident of Amsterdam, doesn’t mince words. 'What we’re facing is far more than harassment—it’s a full-blown pogrom,' he says. 'Fireworks were strategically exploded near hotels and Airbnbs known to host Jewish and Israeli visitors. Groups of Moroccan Muslims roamed the streets, stopping anyone they believed to be Jewish or Israeli, demanding identification.' This isn’t random chaos. This is organized, targeted violence. Cab drivers exposed Jewish tourists’ locations online, making it easy for mobs to attack them. Some Israelis were driven far from their destinations and dropped off in dangerous areas, where gangs were lying in wait. Incredibly, attackers even traveled from Germany to join in the mayhem. Amsterdam, a supposed safe haven, has become a death trap for anyone visibly Jewish. The Police: Protectors or Enablers? Where were the police during this pogrom? Busy harassing Jews trying to defend themselves. According to Levy, some officers openly displayed 'Free Palestine' stickers, a glaring symbol of their sympathies. This isn’t just negligence; it’s betrayal. Take the case of Philip Zeitler Prins, a Jewish resident who has endured harassment for over three years. His home has been defaced with Palestinian flags and hateful graffiti, and threats are a regular occurrence. After years of pleading, a police officer finally visited his home—not to protect him, but to inspect the flags. Despite clear evidence of harassment, law enforcement refused to take action, citing a lack of 'definitive proof.' They wouldn’t even question the neighbors. Zeitler Prins recorded the entire interaction, exposing the police’s cowardice. This isn’t law enforcement; it’s law abandonment. Politicians Fueling the Fire The failure isn’t limited to the police—it goes all the way to the top. Amsterdam’s political leaders are not just passive; they’re active participants in this crisis. GreenLeft council members openly chant slogans like 'From the river to the sea,' a call for Israel’s destruction. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations, supposedly banned, continue with full permission from city officials. The message is clear: Amsterdam’s leadership will protect hate speech over human lives. Silence Is Complicity Where are Amsterdam’s non-Jewish residents? Silent. And that silence speaks volumes. Instead of standing with their Jewish neighbors, many align with the pro-Palestinian narrative, even when it devolves into outright antisemitism. The city is now plastered with pro-Hamas banners and graffiti calling for intifada. 'If a Jewish resident tears down a Palestinian flag, it’s seen as provocative,' Levy explains. 'But these hate symbols are defended as free speech, while the very real danger we face every day is ignored.' This isn’t ignorance. This is willful blindness. Fighting Back: Betar Leads the Charge While Amsterdam’s leaders fail, others are stepping up. Ron Torossian, Chairman of Betar USA, is leading the charge to protect Jewish communities. 'Betar is built on the principles of Ze’ev Jabotinsky: fight or flee in the face of oppression. We choose to fight,' Torossian declares. Betar is organizing rallies, building alliances, and mobilizing communities across Europe to counter antisemitism head-on. 'We’re not just reacting; we’re creating a sustained movement of Jewish pride and resilience,' Torossian says. 'We refuse to back down.' Time for Real Action Here’s the hard truth: Antisemitism is no longer simmering beneath the surface—it’s boiling over. Amsterdam is a litmus test for Europe’s future, and right now, it’s failing. Steven Spielberg and Adam Sandler, both celebrated figures who have capitalized on their Jewish identity in their work—Spielberg through documenting the Holocaust in Schindler’s List and Sandler through his public celebration of Jewish pride—remain conspicuously silent in the face of the growing crisis facing Jews in Amsterdam and beyond. Their silence is particularly glaring given their influence and platforms, which could bring much-needed attention to the dire threat of Islamic antisemitism and government apathy. Betar, a global Zionist organization, is holding rallies in front of their homes to call on them to break their silence and stand in solidarity with the Jewish communities under siege. As Ze’ev Jabotinsky once said, ‘Silence is despicable,’ and in times like these, silence from prominent Jewish figures is not just disappointing—it’s dangerous. Europe’s Jews are standing at a precipice, and the international community must decide: Will you watch another Holocaust unfold, or will you act now? The choice is stark and unforgiving. Antisemitism isn’t freedom of speech. It’s not a political opinion. It’s hatred, plain and simple—and hatred, when left unchecked, metastasizes into violence. If the world allows Amsterdam to become a breeding ground for pogroms, the question won’t be if it spreads but when. This is not just a Jewish issue. This is a human issue. To every leader, influencer, and policymaker: the time for neutrality has passed. If you refuse to speak up, history will remember your silence as complicity. In the words of Ze’ev Jabotinsky: 'Silence is despicable.' Stand with the Jewish people, or stand on the wrong side of history. We will not apologize. We will not retreat. And we will not forget who stood with us—and who didn’t.

Hamas hosted by Turkey after being kicked out of Qatar	Qatar, where Hamas' operations had been based for years, recently came under intense American pressure to expel the terror group from its territory. By World Israel News Staff Turkey has warmly welcomed Hamas' senior leadership after the terror group's officials were forced out of Qatar, according to Hebrew-language media reports. Qatar, where Hamas' operations had been based for years, recently came under intense American pressure to expel the terror group from its territory. Earlier in November, Washington told Qatar to eject Hamas leaders from the country, due to the terror group rejected hostage deals numerous times and murdering several captives, including American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Doha announced that it would no longer serve as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, citing the stalled negotiations for a deal that would see a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the release of the nearly 100 hostages still held in Gaza. Hebrew-language media reported that the terror group's top brass were asked to leave Qatar, though they weren't given a specific deadline by which they needed to depart. According to a Times of Israel report, many of Hamas' most important surviving politburo members are establishing a new base of operations in Ankara. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly praised Hamas and stressed that his country will remain friendly towards the terror group. 'No one can make us qualify Hamas as a terrorist organization,' he said during a March speech in Istanbul. 'Turkey is a country that speaks openly with Hamas leaders and firmly backs them.' In April, Erdogan hosted the now-assassinated head of Hamas' politburo, Ismail Haniyeh, in Istanbul. During the hours-long meeting, 'President Erdogan stated that Palestinians’ acting in unison is of vital importance during this time, that the most robust response to Israel and the way to victory go through unity and integrity, and that Palestine’s rightful cause and facts be communicated more effectively against Israel, which misleads international public opinion,' according to a summary posted by the Turkish Directorate of Communications in a post on social media platform X.

Comparing Trump to Hitler is an ‘insult’ to millions of Jews, say...	New York's Democratic mayor tussles with hosts of The View over the incendiary political rhetoric on the Left likening President-elect Donald Trump to Hitler and Fascists of the 1930s. By World Israel News Staff New York City Mayor Eric Adams urged fellow Democrats last week to tone down their rhetoric and protested attempts to compare former President and President-elect Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler and to members of fascist movements of the 1930s and 1940s. Adams, who is currently under indictment for bribery and campaign finance violations, appeared on ABC's 'The View' Friday to call for more bipartisan cooperation and less incendiary political rhetoric. In particular, Adams took aim at extreme denunciations of Trump on the Left. Questioned co-host Sunny Hostin regarding allegations that his recent public statements rejecting comparisons between Trump and World War II-era fascists were motivated by a desire to secure a presidential pardon from the incoming president. Ahead of the November election, Adams criticized Vice President Kamala Harris after she responded to the question of whether she considered Trump to be a fascist. 'Yes, I do,' Harris said. 'I have heard those terms hurled at me by some political leaders in the city, using terms like Hitler and fascist. My answer is no, I know what Hitler has done, and I know what a fascist regime looks like,' Adams said in late October. Speaking with The View Friday, Adams doubled down on his denial of wrong-doing, while castigating attempts to compare political rivals to Nazi leaders. 'We reached a point in this country where we no longer want to engage in conversation. They were even calling him Hitler,' Adams lamented. 'That was an insult to the millions of Jews and others who died — we know what Hitler did and what I said to our country when I’m on the streets talking to my young people who are protesting on college campuses [with] Hamas signs and calling for the destruction of groups, I said we have to bring down this rhetoric,' he said. 'We have to start engaging in conversation. You know Obama said it right and I agreed. This is not the divided states, this is the United States. We are the greatest country on the globe and people are watching us name-calling.'

Suicide drone from Iraq launched towards southern Israeli city of...	Israeli interceptor missile failed to hit incoming Iraqi drone targeting Eilat, landed in Jordan. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An Iron Dome interceptor fell near Aqaba in Jordan Sunday night after failing to hit its target, an incoming UAV from Iraq. Jordanian news agency Petra reported its military’s confirmation that a 'flying object' had hit in the coastal city, which is located just several hundreds of meters from Eilat at Israel’s southern tip. It reported that there no serious injuries or damage resulted from the subsequent impact. Sappers then arrived to take care of the dangerous debris and citizens were told not to approach the area. Videos uploaded to social media show the interceptor descending outside the Ayla inlet, a luxury development in Aqaba, and two explosions could be heard, one right after the other. The first was seemingly the detonation of the anti-missile’s head that was to have hit the UAV aiming to cause destruction in Eilat, and the second was the result of the interceptor hitting the ground. For its part, the IDF announced that when the incoming missile was discovered, 'several interceptors were launched towards the target. One of them fell in an open space. No reports of casualties were received and the incident is being investigated.' One or more of the other interceptors had hit the target successfully, destroying the threat before it reached Israel’s borders, the army added. Some Eilat residents took to Facebook to complain that they had first heard two very strong, loud explosions and only then the warning siren had sounded in the town. Others said that after the siren went off, they heard another two explosions, seemingly confirming that after the first interceptor went astray, a second had worked as it should. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella network of Iranian-backed Shiite Islamist terrorist groups, claimed responsibility for launching the drone. These groups have arsenals composed of cruise missiles, kamikaze drones and rockets of Iranian origin. They have been launching their long-range missiles sporadically at Israel since November 2023 in support of their fellow Iranian proxy, Hamas, in its war against Israel. A few have managed to get through Israel’s air defense. Notably, last month a drone launched from Iraq killed two Israeli soldiers and injured 24, two of them seriously, in an army base on the Golan Heights in northern Israel.

US will sanction ICC if it pursues Netanyahu arrest, incoming Sen...	Senator John Thune, the next Majority Leader of the Senate, warned the International Criminal Court that the US will impose sanctions on the court if it moves forward with plans to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israel's former defense minister. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The next leader of the upper chamber of the U.S. Congress warned the International Criminal Court at The Hague Sunday that the United States will impose sanctions on the tribunal should it insist on moving forward with plans to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. South Dakota Senator John Thune took to X/Twitter Sunday, penning a scathing post, castigating the ICC and chief prosecutor Karim Khan over their 'outrageous' bid to pursue the arrests of Netanyahu and Gallant. 'If the ICC and its prosecutor do not reverse their outrageous and unlawful actions to pursue arrest warrants against Israeli officials, the Senate should immediately pass sanctions legislation, as the House has already done on a bipartisan basis,' Thune tweeted. 'If Majority Leader Schumer does not act, the Senate Republican majority will stand with our key ally Israel and make this – and other supportive legislation – a top priority in the next Congress.' Thune, who currently serves as Senate Minority Whip, is set to replace Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell as head of the Republican Senate Caucus on January 3rd, as the 119th Congress begins its two-year session. With Republicans having picked up a total of four seats in the Senate, giving them a 53-47 majority in the upper chamber, Thune will also become Senate Majority Leader on January 3rd, replacing the incumbent, New York Democrat Chuck Schumer. Hours after Thune's tweet, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson noted that the lower chamber of Congress passed a measure to sanction the ICC in June, adding that under Schumer, the Senate had yet to take up the proposal. 'The House voted in JUNE to sanction the ICC if they proceed with their illegitimate plot, but Chuck Schumer has refused to bring the bill up in the Senate,' Johnson tweeted. 'Grateful to see the resolve of Sen John Thune for BOTH of our chambers to stand TOGETHER with Israel in the new Congress.'

‘Totally surreal,’ Jewish Arizonan wins $1 million from Elon Musk...	Offenhartz’s plans for the windfall include charitable giving to Big Brothers, the Jewish National Fund, and to Jewish education in Phoenix. By Dave Gordon, JNS After Joshua Offenhartz decided to sign a petition from Elon Musk’s America Political Action Committee, which offered a potential $47 per referral and a shot at $1 million for those in battleground states, he sent it in a group text to family and friends. 'They loved it, but they thought I was crazy,' the Jewish lawyer in Phoenix told JNS. Signatories to the petition state that they support constitutional principles, with a particular focus on free expression and gun ownership rights. 'I read it. I largely agreed that we need the First Amendment to protect our freedoms of speech, our freedoms of religion,' said Offenhartz, who received the petition in September. 'As an attorney, I believe in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments—the right to protection and privacy, the right to due process.' 'It’s election season, so I sort of sign-up for everything because you never know where interesting information is going to come from that you share with family and friends,' he told JNS. On Nov. 3, Offenhartz was on a walk with his children, sharing literature for local Arizona candidates when he received a text message from an unknown number informing him that America PAC would be in his neighborhood that day. It wanted to 'stop by and say, ‘Thank you for the work you did.’' Offenhartz’s wife, Shira Offenhartz, thought the family was in the money, but the attorney didn’t want either of them to get their hopes up. Then a large SUV pulled up in front of the house, a team got out and someone opened the trunk and revealed an oversized check. 'They walked up to the door, and it was sort of like Publishers Clearing House,' he told JNS. 'They handed me this $1 million check.'

Visiting Israel has also shaped Offenhartz’s Jewish identity, he told JNS. He has the 'dubious achievement of having traveled to Israel when conflict breaks out.' After graduating high school, he took part in a USY Birthright trip. While visiting Rosh Hanikra along the northern border in 2006, Hezbollah fired at Israel and kidnapped soldiers. 'That was just real, and an amazing experience to be there, to see the places that I learned about, to walk in the footsteps of our ancestors—very powerful and very moving,' he said of the trip. 'Then being and seeing firsthand the security threat, but then seeing how fragile Israel was firsthand, and having parts of the trip rerouted and rescheduled because of threats, having to shelter in place at times,' he added. 'That made it very real.' 'That really solidified any advocacy that I may have been wavering on growing up,' Offenhartz said. In 2007, he returned to Israel to mark Hillel’s 75th anniversary, and in 2013, he led a Birthright contingent. On the latter trip, the group left a tour of Yad Vashem in Jerusalem when Jerusalem was struck by rocket fire. It ran into the museum’s parking garage basement shelter. 'I’ve been there during times of conflict. I’ve also been there in times of peace. It helps with my spirituality and my personal belief, but also it helps solidify for me that our enemies tell us what they really think they mean,' he told JNS. 'It really motivates me, because I think we take that blessing for granted, because, as we saw on Oct. 7, Israel is so fragile,' he added. ‘Moving the needle’ Offenhartz has long thought highly of the Tesla and Twitter owner, whose PAC so unexpectedly just gave him $1 million. 'I’m unashamed and unafraid to say that I think that he is a brilliant businessman, and I really am impressed that he is walking-the-walk when most people just talk-the-talk of things that we want to see in the 21st century,' he said. Offenhartz’s grandfather worked on the Apollo space program. 'I’m in love with the idea of SpaceX and Starlink and space exploration,' he said. 'I don’t own a Tesla, but I love the idea of electric cars.' His first private sector job was in and his master’s thesis was about solar energy. 'I believe in that too,' he said. 'I’ve always admired Elon Musk as a businessman and the things that he was doing.' 'Maybe if the government wasn’t so hard on the man, trying to do great things. I think that he showed the world, in a different way, that there are smart minds outside of politics that can come up with ideas to move the needle in ways that our political class hasn’t thought of,' he added.

Hamas supporters lay siege to British banking giant over Israel s...	The unruly mob also harassed customers by urging them to close their accounts. By Jewish Breaking News Barclays Bank faced widespread disruption on Saturday as hundreds of Hamas supporters besieged branches throughout the UK, demanding the bank sever its financial ties with Israel. According to the Telegraph, the most significant disruption occurred in Brighton where dozens of anti-Israel protesters forced the branch to shut its doors after blocking the bank’s entrance with a banner reading 'Stop Arming Israel.' The unruly mob also harassed customers by urging them to close their accounts. While some bank locations maintained operations under the watchful eye of police and security guards, the demonstrations organized by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) spread across multiple cities, including a notable gathering in Brent, where a dozen protesters occupied the entrance while displaying 'Free Palestine' banners. Similar scenes played out in Glasgow, Leeds, Oxford, and Coventry. The PSC has accused Barclays of 'bankrolling Israel’s genocidal assault on Palestinians,' alleging the bank has invested more than £2 billion in arms companies selling weapons to Israel, while providing additional financial services worth £6.1 billion. In response, Barclays defended its position, maintaining it is 'committed to respecting human rights.' 'As a universal bank, Barclays provides a range of client services in relation to the shares of publicly listed companies, including those in the defense and security sector,' a statement by Barclays reads. 'Barclays is committed to respecting human rights as defined by the International Bill of Human Rights and takes account of other internationally accepted human rights standards and frameworks. 'We have a published statement on defense and security which sets out our policy positions and governs any business activities in the defense and security sector, including setting restrictions on certain financing activities and requiring enhanced due diligence as appropriate on clients in the sector.'

IDF eliminates Hezbollah media chief in Beirut strike	In October, Afif boasted, 'It won't be long before we take Israeli captives.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An Israeli strike in central Beirut killed a Hezbollah media chief on Sunday, Reuters reports. Mohammad Afif, who served as the long-time media advisor to the deceased head of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in the Ras al-Nabaa neighborhood of Beirut. The strike targeted the Ba'ath Party offices in Lebanon, and the head of the party, Ali Hijazi, told the Lebanese media that Afif was dead. Before the strike, IDF Arab Media Spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted on X/Twitter a map of places Israel was planning to target. The post was intended for civilians in the Haret Hreik and Burj al-Barajneh areas as an evacuation notice. Reuters reported that civilians in the Ras al-Nabaa did not receive evacuation orders. In addition to serving as media adviser to Nasrallah, Mohammed Afif ran the Al-Manar television station before taking over the media office. In October, Afif boasted, 'It won't be long before we take Israeli captives.' Although he acknowledged that Hezbollah did not have Israeli hostages, he said the terror organization 'came close' to kidnapping Israelis. He also said that Hezbollah was 'only in the first round' as the IDF fought terrorists in Southern Lebanon. A security official told Maariv that eliminating Afif has 'significant implications.' 'Firstly, such an action deals a mortal blow to the Shia population and Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon,' he explained. 'In addition, it could further impair the organization's ability to influence the Lebanese public and operate with its own members. This individual was responsible for propaganda, conveying messages, and was a dominant figure for the organization's leadership and in engaging with the Lebanese public,' the official said. IDF reported that the air force had carried out 'intelligence-based strikes on six Hezbollah military targets' in the Dahieh area. The IDF also targeted weapons storage facilities, command centers, and military sites.

Israeli breakthrough could halve radiation sessions for prostate ...	The study aims not only to improve patient experience but also to optimize healthcare resources. By Pesach Benson, TPS An Israeli medical breakthrough could cut in half the number of radiation treatments needed for prostate cancer patients. Prostate cancer remains one of the most common malignancies among men worldwide, with approximately 2,500 new cases diagnosed annually in Israel. Half of these are detected early, when radiation therapy is a highly effective treatment option. However, the current standard of five sessions requires significant time, preparation, and emotional resilience from patients. Research conducted by doctors at the Davidoff Comprehensive Cancer Center at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering high-dose external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer in just two sessions, without compromising safety or outcomes. 'Reducing the number of radiation treatments from five to two can significantly ease the physical and emotional toll on patients, making the treatment process more tolerable,' said Dr. Elisha Fredman, who led the research. 'Treating patients more efficiently also allows them to start therapy sooner, benefiting everyone involved.' Fredman drew inspiration from a more invasive approach called brachytherapy. This technique involves the surgical implantation of radioactive particles into the prostate, effectively treating the cancer in just two sessions. Building on this concept, Dr. Fredman developed a non-invasive alternative using external beam radiation, delivering high doses over two sessions instead of five. The study aims not only to improve patient experience but also to optimize healthcare resources. By shortening treatment schedules, the hospital can treat more patients and reduce waiting times, all while minimizing long-term side effects. Although similar studies are underway in New York, London, and Toronto, Fredman’s study is expected to surpass these in scale, marking a significant milestone in global cancer research. Since the study’s inception, more than 40 patients have participated, with promising results. 'The response to treatment has been excellent so far, with no unusual side effects,' Fredman reported.

Oct. 7th victims’ families sue Iran for supporting Hamas	The families are seeking financial compensation from Iran under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Anti-Terrorism Act. By World Israel News Staff The families of victims murdered in the October 7th terror onslaught are suing Iran in an American court, presenting previously-unseen evidence that the Islamic Republic was directly involved in supporting the plan for the massacre. The suit, filed in Washington D.C. Federal Court by those whose relatives held U.S. citizenship, charges that Iran had advanced direct knowledge of the October 7th plan and provided extensive funding to Hamas for the attack. Documents presented in the lawsuit, which appear to have been obtained directly from Hamas leadership, detailed how a prominent Iranian military commander had met with a senior Hamas official just months before the attack. The Iranian official assured his Hamas counterpart that Tehran would fully support the slaughter. The terror group's slain leader, Yahya Sinwar, demanded that Iran funnel Hamas $7 million on a monthly basis for the upcoming 'big project' - a code name for the October 7th murder, rape, kidnapping, and mutilation spree. 'Hard, incontrovertible evidence of who funded Hamas is now becoming available in the form of documents, bank records and the like, and we intend to hold those parties accountable, in the courts of the United States or elsewhere, for however long it takes,' said attorneys Gary Osen and Lee Wolosky, who are leading the case, said in a statement. The families are seeking financial compensation from Iran under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Anti-Terrorism Act. All the groups named in the lawsuit, which include Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are all officially designated as terror organizations by the U.S. government. 46 Americans were murdered by Hamas on October 7th, including children, babies, and elderly people. 12 were taken hostage to Gaza, where seven remain today. Three of those American hostages are confirmed to be dead.

Kushner to serve as informal Trump Mideast adviser	Kushner’s close ties to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as well as to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could allow for more private contacts. By JNS President-elect Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner will reportedly play an important role in U.S. Middle East policy, even though he will not formally be part of the administration. Regional diplomats and Trump allies recognize that Kushner—who has significant financial interests in the Gulf—has forged deep relationships from his position as a senior White House adviser during the first Trump administration, CNN reported on Friday. 'No one on the incoming team has what Jared has, and that is trust. Jared earned it, he didn’t have it at the beginning. He earned it. That takes time to build,' said a diplomat from a Middle Eastern nation. 'Friendships are forever in this region,' an Israeli source who dealt with the first Trump administration told CNN. 'My assumption is that his role is much more in his hands than anybody else’s.' After President Joe Biden took office four years ago, Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, moved to Florida and largely avoided politics. He founded an investment fund shortly after leaving Washington with major backing from sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf, including $2 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Kushner’s close ties to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as well as to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could allow for more private contacts, the report noted. The second Trump administration is certain to make the expansion of the landmark 2020 Abraham Accords, which Kushner spearheaded, a cornerstone of its Middle East program with a push toward reaching a historic normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia expected to be front and center of U.S. foreign policy efforts next year.

Israel security agency chief says firing flares at Netanyahu’s re...	Ronen Bar: 'The firing of flash bombs at the residence of the prime minister is the gravest kind of incident and is far from legitimate protest.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Ronen Bar, head of Israel's Security Agency (Shin Bet) said that those who fired flares at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea will be dealt with severely and the incident shows a 'dangerous level' of activism. After three people were arrested in connection with the firing of flares at the Prime Minister's residence in the early hours of Sunday morning, Ronen Bar said, 'The firing of flash bombs at the residence of the prime minister is the gravest kind of incident and is far from legitimate protest.' 'This is rising to dangerous levels' of activism, he added. Bar said that Shin Bet is required by law to protect symbols of the Israeli government, such as the Prime Minister's residence, and that violent acts against these symbols would not be tolerated. He said, 'We acted promptly with the police to identify and arrest those suspects involved in the incident, using all the tools at our disposal.' Shin Bet and Lahav 433 investigated the incident shortly after it occurred and called it a 'dangerous escalation.' No members of the Netanyahu family were home during the flares' firing, and no damage was reported to the home. The incident drew strong criticism from members of the government and members of the Opposition. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and National Unity chairman Benny Gantz strongly condemned the incident and said those responsible should be brought to justice. Yisrael Beytenu chief Avigdor Liberman said it 'signifies an escalation in the attempt to harm the democratic institutions of the State of Israel.' 'Full backing must be given to the Shin Bet and the Israel Police in the investigation, and those involved must be brought to justice,' Liberman added. President Isaac Herzog said he had spoken to the Shin Bet chief about 'the urgent need to investigate and deal with those responsible for the incident as soon as possible.' 'The flames must not be allowed to escalate. I am again warning against increased violence in the public sphere,' Herzog wrote.

Israel mulls sending captured Russian weapons to Ukraine	Russian arms include Kornet anti-tank guided missiles, Strela shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, RPG-29 Vampire and other weapons. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Russian-made weapons captured from Hezbollah and Hamas may soon find their way to Ukraine as Israeli lawmakers consider legislation authorizing the transfers. Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk told The Press Service of Israel he praised the symbolism of what the move represents. 'The Ukrainian reaction is positive, but in order to make such a decision, you don’t need Knesset laws,' Korniychuk told TPS-IL. According to the ambassador, if the goal was simply to transfer the weapons discretely, this could be done by the Israeli Minister of Defense alone, without the need for Knesset legislation. 'This [Knesset legislation] was to make it more public,' Korniychuk said. 'I’ve already heard all these ideas of not provoking Russia. But given everything, Russia hosting Hamas leaders, supplying Hezbollah with weapons, and more, what else can you provoke?' 'We have the same enemy, Iran, Russia, and the Iranian proxies,' he added. The bill, which has been placed on the Knesset table for early discussion, specifically allows for weaponry confiscated during military operations, in Lebanon and in territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority, to the Ukrainian armed forces. The legislation is being spearheaded by Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel and MK Dan Ilouz. Based on photos and videos released by the Israel Defense Forces, the seized Russian arms include Kornet anti-tank guided missiles, Strela shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, RPG-29 Vampire and RPG-27 Tavolga rocket-propelled grenade launchers, Metis-M anti-tank missile systems, and MRO-A rocket-propelled anti-personnel flamethrowers. Also confiscated were stockpiles of Kalashnikov rifles. It isn’t clear if the weapons were directly provided by Russia or delivered by third parties. Under the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Gottheimer announces bid for NJ governor	As New Jersey’s only Jewish congressional representative, Gottheimer has been recognized by Jewish groups for his efforts to promote Holocaust education and combatting antisemitism. By Andrew Bernard, JNS Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) announced his bid for the New Jersey governor’s office on Friday, joining a crowded Democratic field to replace term-limited Gov. Tim Murphy (D) in the 2025 election. Gottheimer, who is Jewish and one of Israel’s staunchest advocates on Capitol Hill, announced his candidacy at Runway Diner in South Hackensack with a focus on lowering the cost of living in the Garden State. 'Life in Jersey has become too damn expensive,' Gottheimer said. 'Today, I’m launching my campaign for governor to cut your taxes and costs and to make Jersey affordable again.' Gottheimer has represented New Jersey’s 5th Congressional District along the northern border with New York since he won the seat from a Republican incumbent in 2016. He handily won re-election on Nov. 5 by an 11-point margin. As New Jersey’s only Jewish congressional representative, Gottheimer has been recognized by Jewish groups for his efforts to promote Holocaust education and has been one of the leading voices in the House on combating antisemitism and supporting Israel. 'We need to bring the full force of the law against the antisemites who are harassing Jewish or any other communities all over this state,' Gottheimer said in his announcement speech, adding that he supports putting more cops on the beat. Other Democrats, who have announced their intention to run for the governor’s office, include Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop (who is Jewish), with Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) reportedly set to announce her candidacy later this week. Long thought of as a Democratic bastion that occasionally elects Republican moderates, New Jersey has emerged as a more competitive battleground in statewide races in recent elections. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris beat President-elect Donald Trump in the state by just five points in November, and Gov. Murphy beat his Republican challenger in the 2021 election by a 51-48 margin. That challenger, former New Jersey General Assembly member Jack Ciattarelli, is once again seeking the Republican nomination alongside five other declared contenders. Gottheimer in his announcement promised to do 'battle' with Trump over issues like the state and local tax deduction, while also touting his bipartisan record as a co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus. 'The election outcome was a horrible loss for America,' Gottheimer said in a video accompanying his announcement. 'Every candidate running for governor agrees we need to stand up to Trump on the major issues.' Trump, who capped the SALT deduction as part of his 2017 tax cuts, pledged in the 2024 campaign that he would lift the cap in a social media post aimed at voters on Long Island. 'I will turn it around, get SALT back, lower your taxes and so much more,' Trump wrote. Other key issues in the New Jersey gubernatorial race include New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s plan to impose a $9 congestion charge on drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street starting in January, potentially affecting a huge number of New Jersey commuters and businesses. Gottheimer vowed to defeat the toll charge. 'To our friends in the Empire State, let me say this: We beat New York’s outrageous Congestion Tax once,' he said. 'I’m ready to lead the fight to stop it again.' Today, I’m launching my campaign for Governor to lower your taxes, lower your costs, and to make Jersey affordable again. I will help you and your family get ahead and I’ll do it while protecting our Jersey Values. pic.twitter.com/XrZm595yD4 &mdash; Josh Gottheimer (@Josh4Jersey) November 15, 2024 The post Gottheimer announces bid for NJ governor appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/gottheimer-announces-bid-for-nj-governor/	2024-11-17T08:32:52-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/shutterstock_2201068997-scaled.jpg
‘A miracle’ – None injured as missile destroys Haifa synagogue	The missile hit exactly where we pray,' says regular worshipper at Avot v'Banim synagogue. By World Israel News Staff A historic synagogue with an active congregation was destroyed by a Hezbollah missile on Saturday night, just a few hours after prayers were held in the building. The Avot v'Banim synagogue in Haifa's central Carmel neighborhood was directly struck by the rocket, with dozens of nearby apartments damaged by shrapnel and numerous cars set ablaze by the blast. 'We had a great miracle. Two hours before [the rocket hit] we were still praying here in the synagogue. Look what happened to us here,' Gershon Zaft, a regular worshipper at the synagogue, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'It's a great miracle that there are no casualties,' Zaft stressed. 'The missile hit exactly where we pray. It will take a long time to rebuild our synagogue.' Clips ciruclating on social media of the scene showed that the synagogue's roof was completely destroyed, with much of the structure appearing to implode. 'The destruction is extensive,' Gideon Goldenbar, the synagogue's gabbay (caretaker), told Ynet. 'We hope that we will be able to salvage some Torah scrolls.' The efforts to retrieve Torah scrolls and other holy objects from the synagogue are complicated by the huge amount of debris and the weather, as a rainstorm is expected in the coming days. The synagogue is located in a historic Templar-style building, erected in the 1800s by Germans in Ottoman-era Israel. The missile strike comes on the heels of reports that Israel and Lebanon are nearing a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict. While Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar recently confirmed that Israel is 'closer than ever' to reaching a diplomatic agreement that would see Hezbollah stop its daily rocket, missile, and explosive drone attacks against Israel, the timeline for such a deal remains unclear.
