Hostages held for over a decade slated to come home Saturday	Avera Mengistu, 38, and Hisham al-Sayyed, 37, to be released on Saturday, alongside four other Israeli captives. By World Israel News Staff Two Israeli hostages held in captivity by the Hamas terror group for more than ten years are expected to be released in the coming days, alongside an additional four Israelis kidnapped on October 7th. The Israeli government officially confirmed that Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayyed are slated for release this Saturday. Both Mengistu, now 38, and al-Sayyed, now 37, suffer from mental health issues, and entered the Strip of their own accord in two separate incidents in 2014 and 2015. Mengistu's 'parents, brothers, and sisters will travel to greet him,' a relative, Gil Elias, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'This is joyful and surprising news that we have been waiting for for more than 10 years,' Elias added. 'We are eagerly waiting for him to arrive, I want to see him walk out of there on his own two feet, with a smile,' he said. In a media statement, al-Sayyed's family said that while they are thrilled about his upcoming release, they empathize with the families of the hostages who will not be returned during this phase of the deal. 'Our Hisham will return home&#8230;but the good news about his expected return will not be complete until all the abductees return to their homes,' the family said. 'The ceasefire and hostage deal agreement must not be allowed to fail, and the fate of additional abductees must not be a decade in captivity.' Al-Sayyed, a Bedouin-Israel, briefly served in the Israeli army, but was discharged due to his mental health issues. His father, also named Hisham, told Ynet that he had reached out to the families of those kidnapped on October 7th, as he understands their anguish. 'I visit some of the families, we try to be in touch with all of them,' he said. 'They are from all sides of the political spectrums. We are in touch with families and not aligned with any political platform or movement.'

UN official demands Israel, US pay reparations to Gaza	United Nations special rapporteur Francesca Albanese demands Israel and the United States prepare to pay reparations to Gaza, claiming both are liable under international law. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior United Nations official is demanding the United States and Israel pay war reparations to the Gaza Strip and to the Palestinian Authority, claiming both countries are liable under international law. On Sunday, United Nations Special Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories Francesca Albanese posted on her X/Twitter account that Israel's war against the Hamas terror organization in Gaza and its counter-terror operations in Judea and Samaria constitute a 'genocidal assault' against Palestinian Arabs. Furthermore, she argued, Israel is liable for war reparations to Gaza and the Palestinian people at large. The United States, too, must 'make plans to offer reparations' due to its role in arming the Israeli military. 'It is about time that Israel and the US - and those who enabled and armed the genocidal assault against the Palestinians - make plans to offer REPARATIONS to the Palestinian people to rebuild Gaza, as prescribed by international law,' Albanese wrote. The Italian human rights attorney also lambasted President Donald Trump's plan to resettle the population of Gaza abroad and to place the enclave under American control. 'HOW to rebuild Gaza, much of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, is up to the Palestinians. PS. Riviera plan does not count as reparation; rather as a rapacious attempt to continue to commit crimes in Palestine.' Since her tenure as Special Rapporteur began in 2022, Albanese has repeatedly become embroiled in controversies over her comments on Israel, on Jews and the 'Jewish lobby,' and strong support for the Palestinian cause and refusal to condemn deadly attacks on Israelis. According to a report last month by the Jewish Insider, Albanese's behavior has even drawn criticism from within the United Nations' leadership, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres privately telling American Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism Deborah Lipstadt that Albanese is a 'horrible person.' Guterres reportedly used that phrase twice to describe Albanese during his talk with Lipstadt at a Munich Security Conference. In the past, Albanese has compared Israelis to Nazis, claimed the 'Jewish lobby' has subjugated the United States, and justified Hamas invasion and massacres of October 7th, 2023, saying the Israeli victims were 'not killed because of their Judaism but in response to Israel's oppression.'

Iran threatens fresh missile attack on Israel ‘in due time’	IRGC deputy commander-in-chief says Iran will attack Israel with ballistic missiles for a third time, in the near future. By World Israel News Staff A senior Iranian military official pledged a third round of ballistic missile strikes on Israel, saying that the attack would occur in the near future. Deputy IRGC commander-in-chief Brigadier General Ali Fadavi said while speaking at a conference on Monday that 'True Promise III will be carried out in due time.' Fadavi claimed that Israel had suffered a crushing defeat in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which was launched following the October 7th massacre. 'Zionist regime officials themselves admit that Hamas won and they lost,' Fadavi said. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that after battling Iranian proxy groups, including Hezbollah, Jerusalem 'can and will finish the job' fighting Iran's 'axis of terror.' In response, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei sniped that Israel 'cannot do a damn thing' to seriously damage Iran. The exchange came on the heels of reports that Israel is planning a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities later this year. After a massive weapons shipment from the U.S. was delivered to Israel, which was previously held up by the Biden administration, speculation has grown that an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear assets is imminent. 'If the Zionist entity attacks our nuclear facilities, we will respond in kind. I do not believe they would take such a reckless step, as they know well how we would react,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Arabic-language outlet Al Mayadeen . In November, shortly after Israel destroyed critical air defense systems following Iran's second attack on Israel, 'Responding to the Zionist entity’s attack is inevitable and certain,' Araghchi said to the outlet at the time. 'However, the circumstances, timing, and form of this response will be determined based on the appropriate conditions.'

Jewish groups urge Knesset to press UN on Hamas sexual crimes	The UN has yet to list Hamas as a party accused of committing rape in armed conflict or hold the terrorist organization accountable for these crimes against humanity. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A delegation of Jewish groups urged the Knesset to pressure the UN to hold Hamas accountable for its sexual crimes committed since October 7th, 2023. The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations addressed a special Knesset session on Monday. Carol Ann Schwartz, National President of World Hadassah, highlighted the global effort to seek justice for victims of Hamas's sexual violence. 'We were outraged by Hamas’ brutal October 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the reports of widespread weaponization of sexual violence,' she said. 'Over the past year, the war has deeply affected women in personal ways. We met with UN leaders and mobilized over 150,000 grassroots signatures from nearly 120 countries, in addition to collaborating with 120 organizations, to demand that the United Nations take action and hold Hamas accountable.' She continued, 'The UN has yet to list Hamas as a party accused of committing rape in armed conflict or hold the terrorist organization accountable for these crimes against humanity. We will not give up. Sexual violence in conflict is increasing worldwide, and accountability is crucial to preventing future atrocities.' Meredith Jacobs, CEO of Jewish Women International and Co-Founder, spoke about the profound impact sexual violence has on women and how Israelis and Jewish women are being excluded from the conversation, especially on college campuses. 'The effects of dehumanization, objectification, and hate are playing out on our campuses and beyond. Jewish survivors of sexual violence no longer feel safe seeking help from mainstream agencies,' she said. 'Those of us in the field have lost colleagues, and women’s studies programs at universities across the United States are teaching that Israel is weaponizing feminism and that Zionists are not to be trusted.' Sheila Katz, CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women, emphasized the urgency of breaking the silence surrounding Hamas’ crimes: 'Rape is a violation of humanity. It must never be normalized—not in our cities, not on our campuses, and not as a weapon of war. But silence, in itself, normalizes rape.'

Sa’ar: Israel to start Phase 2 talks with Hamas	As part of Phase 2, Jerusalem will reportedly demand the release of all hostages in addition to the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza and the dismantling of its terrorist army. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told reporters on Tuesday that Jerusalem decided to start talks on Phase 2 of the ongoing hostage release and ceasefire agreement with Hamas. 'We had a Security Cabinet meeting last night. We decided to open negotiations on the second phase,' Jerusalem’s top diplomat said during a briefing for journalists at the Foreign Ministry. As part of the talks set to begin later this week, the Israeli government will demand the complete disarmament of Iranian-backed Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist organizations in Gaza, the minister stressed. A 'Hezbollah model' in which Hamas retains its 'military' capabilities is unacceptable for Israel, 'and therefore we need a total demilitarization of Gaza and no presence of the Palestinian Authority,' stated Sa’ar. Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha earlier on Tuesday that 'there is a positive atmosphere regarding the second phase of the agreement.' He added, 'The arrival of the delegations depends on the decisions of the parties involved.' Jerusalem’s negotiating teams in Egypt and Qatar have so far focused only on the implementation of the current Phase 1 of the Gaza truce. An Israeli political source cited by Ynet on Tuesday said that Jerusalem was making 'great efforts to release all six remaining living hostages in the first phase, as well as four hostages who are no longer alive.' Hebrew media reported on Monday that Israel this week is seeking the freedom of six instead of three living hostages during the upcoming seventh release. Under the terms of the deal, Hamas is also expected to release on Thursday the bodies of four captives murdered in Gaza. In exchange for releasing the three additional living hostages, the Israeli government has reportedly signaled its willingness to allow the entry of hundreds of additional caravans for the reconstruction of the Strip. The Israeli official told Ynet on Tuesday, 'In the outline for the release of the hostages, Israel has committed to bringing caravans and mechanical engineering equipment into the Gaza Strip following strict inspection. As part of the negotiations, and subject to Hamas’s compliance with the deal, Israel will begin to allow this in a controlled and gradual manner.' The first 42-day phase of the deal with Hamas is set to end on March 1. On Monday, the Security Cabinet met to formulate 'instructions for the continuation of the negotiations regarding the second stage,' according to an official statement from the Prime Minister’s Office. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is working in 'full cooperation and coordination' with the U.S. administration on the next phase of the ceasefire, he emphasized during a joint press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem on Sunday. 'We have a shared strategy, which cannot always be detailed to the public—including when the gates of hell will open. And they will open if all our hostages are not returned, every last one of them,' he stressed. Netanyahu’s remark was a reference to Trump’s warning that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed if Hamas does not release all of the hostages. As part of Phase 2, Jerusalem will reportedly demand the release of all hostages in addition to the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza and the dismantling of its terrorist army. Officials in Jerusalem believe that the terror organization is likely to reject the demands. U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News on Sunday that second-phase talks would take place this week 'at a location to be determined.' Witkoff noted he already had 'very productive and constructive' talks on Sunday with Netanyahu, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and the head of Egypt’s General Intelligence. He said they spoke about 'the sequencing of Phase 2, setting forth positions on both sides, so we can understand … where we are today, and then continuing talks this week at a location to be determined so that we can figure out how we get to the end of Phase 2 successfully.'

Released Palestinian terrorist leaves prison with $633,000	The Palestinian Authority (PA) allocates around $279 million annually to pay salaries to security prisoners in Israeli prisons, which range from $400-$3,400 per month, depending on the sentence. By Anna Epshtein, TPS Ahmed Barghouti, who masterminded suicide bombing attacks which killed twelve Israelis, walked out of an Israeli prison on Saturday afternoon with more than 1.2 million shekels ($338,00) in his bank account, courtesy Palestinian Authority stipends that Israelis refer to as 'pay for slay.' Similar sums awaited Mansour Shreim and Ahmed Abu Khader. The latter was member of the Palestinian Authority security forces who trained terrorists for suicide missions and carried out shooting attacks. Shreim dispatched terrorists who killed nine Israeli teenagers in separate attacks in 2002. 'The Palestinian Authority pays salaries to the terrorists while they are in Israeli prisons. It is not to support their families – it is actually to reward them for what they did,' Itamar Marcus, head of Palestinian Media Watch, told The Press Service of Israel. 'The money is accumulated in the private account of the given terrorist, that is being opened for him immediately after he enters a prison.' The Palestinian Authority (PA) allocates around $279 million annually to pay salaries to security prisoners in Israeli prisons, which range from $400-$3,400 per month, depending on the sentence. For comparison, PA welfare benefits to ordinary Palestinians range from $60-$170 per month depending on need. Those who participated in terror attacks killing Israelis — thus receiving the most severe sentences — got the highest payouts. The Palestinian Authority allocates seven percent of its annual budget for its so-called 'Martyr’s Fund,' which provides stipends to Palestinian terrorists in Israeli prisons, and the families of terrorists killed in attacks. Israeli officials say the stipends provide incentives for terror and regularly offset an equivalent amount from taxes that Israel collects on behalf of the PA. According to Palestinian Media Watch, the total amount of money that awaits the terrorists released as part of the current ceasefire deal with Hamas is around $142 million. Most enriched by the terror stipends is Muhammed Tus, who was released on Jan. 25 and deported to a third country via Egypt. According to PMW, Tus, who served 40 years for several terror attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians, has amassed $633,000. The runner-up is Raad Saadi, who served 36 years for killing Israeli soldiers and was deported. His bank account now has $571,000 courtesy the PA. PA President Mahmoud Abbas signed a decree on Feb. 10 that appeared to end the payments, but Marcus called the move a pretense to please the US. 'They moved the funds to another bank account, the same that pays welfare benefits, because they need the US money,' Marcus told TPS-IL. 'But several PA sources say the salaries to the terrorists will remain very high, identical to what they were. We will only know this in March, once the payments are made.' The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how Israeli captives are alive. Since the first hostage release of Jan. 19, Hamas has freed 19 Israeli and five Thai captives in exchange for 952 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists. Hamas is due to return the bodies of four dead hostages on Thursday and free six live captives on Saturday. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 73 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed to be dead.

Hamas official says bodies of Bibas family will return to Israel ...	Kfir and Ariel’s father, Shiri’s husband Yarden, was also taken hostage and held separately. By Ben Sales, JTA This is a developing story. A Hamas official has announced that the terror group will return the bodies of four Israeli hostages on Thursday, among them the Bibas family. Hamas is also due to release six living hostages on Saturday. The return of the bodies of Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas would mark a tragic end to 16 months of activism, protest and prayer on behalf of the family, who more than anyone else became symbols of the Israeli hostages’ plight. Kfir and Ariel’s father, Shiri’s husband Yarden, was also taken hostage and held separately. He was released earlier this month. An image of Shiri clutching the two boys, then ages 9 months and 4, as they were abducted into Gaza circulated widely after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Since then, their names and pictures, identifiable by the boys’ red hair, have been at the center of global efforts to secure the hostages’ release, have symbolized the atrocities of Oct. 7 and have animated the prayers and hopes of Jews and other advocates worldwide. Images of the family in happier times have spread worldwide. Since a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, Kfir and Ariel Bibas have been the only two children held hostage in Gaza. Hamas claimed in November 2023 that Shiri and the two boys had been killed, and Israel said it was investigating the claim but did not confirm it. In the year-plus since, advocates for the hostages have held out hope that the family remained alive. In recent weeks, Israel has broadcast increasing worry about Shiri, Kfir and Ariel, who are on the list of hostages to be released during the current ceasefire. An Israeli official expressed 'grave concerns' for their fate. Concerns rose further after Hamas announced that eight of the 33 hostages due to be released during the first phase of the ceasefire were dead. On Tuesday, in a prerecorded video, Hamas official Khalil Al-Hayya announced the release of the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, 'among them the bodies of the Bibas family.' CNN and the Associated Press also reported that Hamas announced the return of the bodies of the Bibas family. In response, relatives of the Bibases said in a statement that they had not received confirmation of Shiri, Kfir and Ariel’s fate, and asked for privacy. 'In the past few hours, we have been in turmoil following Hamas spokesperson’s announcement about the planned return of our Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir this Thursday as part of the hostages’ remains release phase,' said the statement, made via the Hostages and Families Forum. 'We want to make it clear that while we are aware of these reports, we have not yet received any official confirmation regarding this matter. Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over.' The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that four dead hostages would be released on Thursday followed by six living hostages on Saturday. The bodies of the final four hostages included in the first phase of the agreement will be released the following week. The announcement did not include the hostages’ names. 'Understandings have been reached in the Cairo negotiations according to which six living first-stage hostages will be released on Saturday,' the statement said. 'This Thursday, four deceased hostages will be returned to Israel. Pursuant to the agreement, four additional deceased hostages are due to be returned to Israel next week.'

Hamas to release six living hostages on Saturday	In addition, the remains of four hostages killed in Hamas captivity will be handed over to Israel on Thursday. By JNS The Hamas terrorist group agreed to double the number of hostages scheduled to be freed as part of the seventh release on Saturday to six, the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem announced on Tuesday. In addition, the bodies of four hostages murdered in Hamas captivity will be handed over on Thursday, in line with the ceasefire deal, which stipulates that the remains will be returned on the 33rd day of the truce. 'In accordance with the agreement, four additional slain hostages are expected to be handed over to Israel next week,' the PMO added. A political source cited by Ynet earlier on Tuesday said that Jerusalem was making 'great efforts to release all six remaining living hostages in the first phase, as well as four hostages who are no longer alive.' In exchange for releasing the three additional living hostages, the Israeli government has reportedly signaled its willingness to allow the entry of hundreds of additional caravans for the reconstruction of the Strip.

As part of the negotiations, and subject to Hamas’s compliance with the deal, Israel will begin to allow this in a controlled and gradual manner.' According to official estimates, a total of 73 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after 500-plus days, including 70 abducted during the Hamas-led cross-border terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023. This figure includes the remains of at least 35 hostages, confirmed dead by Israeli authorities. Hamas is reportedly scheduled to hand over the names of the first slain captives slated for release on Thursday morning. Military ambulances will collect the bodies at a Gaza meeting point, from where they will be brought to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. Israeli officials involved in the preparations have said that the families will only be informed after the full identification process is completed.

Egypt pushing plan to keep Gazans in Gaza – report	Cairo drafts alternative to Trump's Gaza resettlement plan, with the aim of rebuilding the Strip without relocating the area's roughly 2 million residents abroad. By World Israel News Staff Egypt is drafting an alternative plan for the future of the Gaza Strip, an Egyptian state media outlet has reported, hoping to replace President Donald Trump's proposal to resettle the entire population of Gaza abroad. The Al-Ahram newspaper, a mouthpiece of the Cairo government, reported that the Egyptian government is working to put together a comprehensive plan under which the roughly two million Gazans living in the Gaza Strip would remain in the coastal enclave during the reconstruction of the war-torn area. Under the plan, Gazans would be temporarily resettled internally within the Gaza Strip in 'secure areas,' while debris is cleared out of the Strip and towns and infrastructure rebuilt by Egyptian and foreign companies. Senior Egyptian officials have begun discussing the plan, which is still in development, with officials from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and a number of European states. A non-partisan Palestinian Arab body, separate from both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority government in Ramallah, would be tasked under the plan with administering the Strip, while a new police force made up of former PA police would provide security - with the help of additional security personnel trained by Western advisers. Egypt hopes to 'refute American President Trump's logic,' the report said. On February 4th, Trump announced his plans to resettle Gaza's population in third-party countries, including Egypt and Jordan, with reports suggesting the U.S. is also considering Indonesia, Albania, and several territories in northern and eastern Africa. Both Egypt and Jordan rejected the plan publicly, with Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, reportedly snubbing Trump, refusing to attend a planned White House meeting in protest of the resettlement plan.

Israeli lawmaker compares Trump’s Gaza plan to Holocaust	Arab party’s sole Jewish MK, already suspended from the Knesset, now faces new ethics board complaint after comparing plan to encourage voluntary mass migration of Gazans to the Holocaust. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli lawmaker sparked controversy Tuesday morning when he compared President Donald Trump’s plan to resettle the entire population of Gaza abroad – and Israel’s efforts to facilitate the implementation of the plan – to the ethnic cleansing of Jews in Austria under the Nazi regime. In a post to his X account, MK Ofer Cassif – a former Hebrew University lecturer now serving as the sole Jewish member in the Hadash-Ta’al party – published a photograph from 1938 showing Austrian Jews lined up outside of the Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna. 'Eighty-six years ago this month, the ‘Central Office for Jewish Emigration’ was established in Berlin with the aim of encouraging voluntary emigration of Jews from Germany,' Cassif wrote, apparently drawing from a text published last summer marking the anniversary of the opening of the Central Office. The Central Office for Jewish Emigration was established by senior SS officer Adolf Eichmann, one of the architects of the Holocaust and the sole Nazi official to be tried and executed in the State of Israel for his role in the genocide of European Jewry. First established in Vienna in August 1938, the Central Office for Jewish Emigration was created months after the Anschluss unified Austria and Germany, bringing Vienna under Nazi rule. Cassif, who is already serving a six-month suspension from the Knesset after signing onto a petition accusing Israel of genocide in the Gaza Strip and calling for an international investigation of the Jewish state, could now face a second suspension after a fellow MK submitted a complaint with the Knesset's ethics committee. MK Amog Cohen (Otzma Yehudit) announced via X Tuesday that he had filed the complaint, calling Cassif a 'traitor.' 'I have just submitted a complaint to the Knesset Ethics Committee against the terrorist supporter Ofer Cassif for his despicable and disgraceful comparison of the voluntary migration plan for Gaza residents to the voluntary migration of Jews from Nazi Germany,' Cohen wrote. 'I sincerely hope that he will once again be severely punished and have his salary revoked. This traitor is unworthy of being in the Israeli Knesset and certainly not of representing the public. He represents the interests of Hamas and BDS movements and serves as a fifth column among us.'

Israel forms new directorate to help Gazans emigrate	The office will provide 'extensive assistance' in an attempt to implement U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Defense Minister Yisrael Katz decided Monday to establish a new directorate within his ministry to aid Palestinians who would like to leave the Gaza Strip, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal last week to resettle them elsewhere so that the Gaza Strip can be rebuilt without Hamas involvement. The ministry’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) outlined a plan for the directorate to implement, which, the ministry said, 'includes extensive assistance that will allow any Gaza resident who wants to emigrate to a third state, to receive support that includes special departure arrangements through the sea, air, and land, among other things.' The new body is expected to include representatives from several government ministries and defense establishment bodies, with the aim of providing a comprehensive framework for the process. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that he is 'committed to U.S. President Trump's plan to create a different Gaza.' He told a conference of the American umbrella group, Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, Monday night that Trump’s 'bold new vision' was 'the only plan that I think can work to enable a different future for the people of Gaza, for the people of Israel, for the surrounding areas.' 'Why not give the people of Gaza a choice? Everyone said it was the largest open-air prison in the world? It's not because of us,' he continued in his address. 'We allow people to leave. In fact, over the last two years, I think, 150,000 Gazans have left.' 'They left because they bribed their way out,' he noted. 'It wasn't via us&#8230;. The rich could leave. But if other people want to leave, give them the choice. Not forced deportation, not ethnic cleansing. In wars, people leave.' MK Ofer Cassif, the only Jewish member of the communist Hadash party, created a political storm when he reacted on X by comparing the ministry’s initiative to Nazi Germany’s establishment of an office to encourage the voluntary emigration of German Jews before World War II began. Israel Beiteinu MK Oded Forer said Cassif’s 'comparison between the voluntary departure of Gaza residents, fleeing the terror of Hamas, which condemned them to a life under a reign of terror, blood, and fire, and the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany, is not only a vicious lie, it is a despicable blood libel.' Cassif cannot be confused with facts,' he continued. 'His fondness for using the symbols of the Third Reich is rivaled only by his insane obsession with harming the State of Israel and serving the enemy's propaganda. I ask for the millionth time, is this an MK or an official Hamas spokesman? One thing is certain, he should not sit in the Israeli Knesset.' After Cassif announced last January that he would join South Africa’s petition against Israel in the International Criminal Court, Forer tried to get the requisite 90 MKs to vote on removing Cassif, but was stymied by several parliamentarians in Yesh Atid and National Unity joining Arab MKs in blocking the move. MK Almog Cohen (Otzma Yehudit) said that he would complain to the Ethics Committee and also restart the process to expel Cassif from the Knesset. His party simultaneously announced that it will submit a bill to lower the majority required to remove a Knesset member to only 80 supporters, which is still 'a significant majority that expresses the support of two thirds of the Knesset members, but is not too high to be feasible.'

British motorbiking couple detained in Iran	The couple’s last public appearance was a YouTube video filmed in the historical city of Yazd on January 3rd. They were due to reach Pakistan by January 4th, but never checked into their hotel in Kerman. By Jewish Breaking News Just days before their disappearance, British couple Craig and Lindsay Foreman wrote about their belief that 'most humans are good, kind people wanting to live a good life.' Now, the 51-year-old carpenter and his 52-year-old psychologist wife find themselves detained in Iran’s notorious prison system. Combining their love for motorcycle travel with academic curiosity, the Foremans’ were on a global expedition to explore different cultures’ perspectives on living a 'good life.' However, their pursuit of happiness would take a wrong turn when they entered Iran from Armenia around December 30, the Telegraph reports. Despite the UK government’s warnings against travel to the region, the Foremans’ remained optimistic. 'The UK government advises against all but essential travel to these areas, and the news paints a pretty grim picture,' they wrote on Facebook as they began their adventure into the Islamic Republic. 'But here’s the thing: overlanders and travelers who’ve ventured through these regions speak of nothing but warm hospitality, incredible landscapes, and memories that last a lifetime.' Their early experiences seemed to confirm this hope. Accompanied by a tour guide, they visited the country’s ancient cities of Tabriz, Tehran, and Isfahan. On January 2nd, Lindsay shared what would become her final Instagram post. 'Travel has a way of reminding you of what really matters,' she wrote. 'On this journey around the world, we’ve felt a deep sense of connection – and nowhere more so than here in Iran.' The couple’s last public appearance was a YouTube video filmed in the historical city of Yazd on January 3rd. They were due to reach Pakistan by January 4th, but never checked into their hotel in Kerman. On Thursday, Iranian state-run media outlets revealed their detention. However, the Foremans’ arrest had little to do with any actual wrongdoing. 'They weren’t arrested for committing a crime – they’re British citizens and that alone is enough to justify their detention and then phone England and ask for something,' an Iranian government source tells the Telegraph. The Foremans’ are reportedly being held in Kerman, a decision that the source suggests may be intended to limit information leaks and keep negotiations away from the capital. British Ambassador Hugo Shorter has managed to meet with the couple at the Kerman Public Prosecutor’s office, though Iranian state media has only released photos with the couples faces blurred. Credit: IRNA Speaking through the UK’s Foreign Office, the family has expressed 'significant concern' over Craig and Lindsay’s wellbeing. 'This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and well-being during this trying time. We truly appreciate the outpouring of support from friends, family, and the community, which has provided us with strength and encouragement as we face this ordeal.'

Anti-Israel students at Bowdoin College to protest suspensions ov...	Bowdoin College has previously said that it will not tolerate unlawful occupations of its buildings. By Dion J. Pierre, The Algemeiner Bowdoin College’s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter will hold on Tuesday a mass rally to protest disciplinary charges brought against an estimated 50 student-members who received interim suspensions and other sanctions for illegally occupying an administrative building earlier this month. As previously reported by The Algemeiner, SJP installed an encampment inside Smith Union to demand a boycott of Israel and signal its opposition to US President Donald Trump’s proposal that Gazans who were displaced by the Israel-Hamas war be resettled elsewhere while the Palestinian enclave is transformed into a hub for tourism and job creation. Bowdoin, moving quickly to quell the disruption, persuaded its students to abandon the effort after just four days by levying interim suspensions on several dozen of them and notifying their families. The consequences so far have stuck, SJP decried in a statement which alleged that some students are now ineligible to dwell in their dormitories and attend class. This week, the group continued, eight of them will participate in hearings that will determine whether they receive full suspensions. SJP is calling for them to be amnestied and restored to good standing. 'Our peers who bravely remained in the encampment have been evicted from campus, unable to attend class (virtually or in person), and are now being subject to a flawed and non-transparent disciplinary process, all for continuing Bowdoin’s long history of student activism,' SJP posted on Instagram on Sunday. 'We will not be silent as our friends face retaliation for standing against a genocide.' It continued, 'Walk out of class with us at 4:30 pm on Tuesday, Feb. 18 and join us for a rally outside Moulton Union to demand amnesty for the Bowdoin Eight.' Bowdoin College has previously said that it will not tolerate unlawful occupations of its buildings. 'We heard from some members of the our community that these events have left them feeling vulnerable,' college president Safa Zaki said in a statement to the campus community, explaining that SJP transgressed 'policies governing building use and student behavior.' She continued, 'These rules are not symbolic. They are designed to ensure that members of the community can feel welcome and safe in every space on campus and have fair access to those spaces.' The college — located in Brunswick, Maine and once the subject of a landmark study which accused it of promoting the excesses of left-wing ideology — is not the only higher education institution that has been convulsed by anti-Israel activity this semester. Columbia University was a victim of infrastructural sabotage last month, when an extremist anti-Zionist group flooded the toilets of an academic building with concrete to mark the anniversary of an alleged killing of a Palestinian child. The targeted facilities were located on several floors of the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA), according to Keren Yarhi-Milo, dean of the school, who addressed the matter, calling the behavior 'deplorable, disruptive, and deeply unsettling, as our campus is a space we cherish for learning teaching, and working, and it will not be tolerated.' Numerous reports indicate the attack may have been the premeditated result of planning sessions which took place many months ago at an event held by Alpha Delta Phi (ADP) — a literary society, according to the Washington Free Beacon. During the event, the Free Beacon reported, ADP distributed literature dedicated to 'aspiring revolutionaries' who wish to commit seditious acts. Additionally, a presentation was given in which complete instructions for the exact kind of attack which struck Columbia were shared with students. In a separate incident on Feb. 5, roughly 50 members of the Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, along with the group Graduate Students for Justice in Palestine, at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) amassed on the property of UC Regent Jay Sures and threatened that he must 'divest now or pay.' As part of the demonstration, the students imprinted their hands, which had been submerged in red paint to symbolize the spilling of blood, all over Sures’ garage door and cordoned the area with caution tape. UCLA responded to their vandalism and intimidation by imposing interim suspensions on both groups. Republicans in Washington, DC have said that anti-Zionist extremism on college campuses 'will no longer be tolerated in the Trump administration.' Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has enacted a slew of policies aimed at reining in their disruptive and discriminatory behavior. Continuing work started during his first administration — when Trump issued Executive Order 13899 to ensure that civil rights law apply equally Jews — Trump’s recent 'Additional Measures to Combat Antisemitism' calls for 'using all appropriate legal tools to prosecute, remove, or otherwise … hold to account perpetrators of unlawful antisemitic harassment and violence.' The order also requires each government agency to write a report explaining how it can be of help in carrying out its enforcement. Another major provision of the order calls for the deportation of extremist 'alien' student activists, whose support for terrorist organizations, intellectual and material, such as Hamas contributed to fostering antisemitism, violence, and property destruction.

South Africa open to nuclear cooperation with Russia and Iran, mi...	South Africa’s latest comments on being open to cooperating with Iran on nuclear matters may further anger the US — and risk an energy deal currently in the works. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner South Africa would consider partnering with Russia or Iran for expanding its civilian nuclear power capacity, a move that could further strain relations with the US and delay the renewal of a strategic energy agreement. 'We can’t have a contract that says Iran or Russia must not bid, we can’t have that condition,' said Minister of Mineral and Petroleum Resources Gwede Mantashe, a leading government advocate for expanding the country’s nuclear capacity. 'If they are the best offer on the table, we’ll take any [country],' he told Reuters. South Africa is looking to add 2,500 megawatts of new nuclear capacity, building on its existing Koeberg plant, the only nuclear power plant in Africa, to address electricity outages that have hampered the economy. The comments from a senior South African government minister came after US President Donald Trump earlier this month signed an executive order to 'halt foreign aid or assistance' to South Africa partly in response to the country’s anti-Israel stance, including its case at the United Nations’ top court accusing the Jewish state of committing genocide in Gaza. Trump’s order was also a response to South Africa’s new land expropriation law, which the US argues discriminates against Afrikaners, a minority South African ethnic group of European descent. In response, South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola vowed his country will continue pursuing its case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). During an interview with the Financial Times published last week, he also denied Trump’s remarks about South Africa’s new land reform, stating that the White House’s statements were 'misinformation.' In his executive order, Trump also accused South Africa of working with Iran 'to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.' US intelligence agencies have for years described Iran as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism, and Washington fears that Iran’s own nuclear program is ultimately designed to build nuclear weapons — a charge denied by Tehran. 'While we do have a good relationship with Iran, we don’t have any nuclear programs with them, nor any trade to speak of,' Lamola said in response to Trump’s executive order. Since the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, which is armed and funded by Iran, invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the South African government has been one of the world’s fiercest critics of Israel’s ensuing military campaign in Gaza. In late 2023, for example, South Africa temporarily withdrew its diplomats from Israel and shut down its embassy in Tel Aviv, saying the government was 'extremely concerned at the continued killing of children and innocent civilians' in Gaza. Then in December of that year, South Africa hosted two Hamas officials who attended a government-sponsored conference in solidarity with the Palestinians. One of the officials had been sanctioned by the US government for his role with the terrorist organization. Months later, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa led the crowd at an election rally in a chant of 'From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free' — a popular slogan among anti-Israel activists that has been widely interpreted as a genocidal call for the destruction of the Jewish state, which is located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. South Africa’s latest comments on being open to cooperating with Iran on nuclear matters may further anger the US — and risk an energy deal currently in the works. South Africa and the United States have been negotiating a new civilian nuclear pact, called a Section 123 agreement, which is necessary for the export of US-made nuclear fuel or equipment. Implemented in 1997, the previous agreement expired in December 2022. It is still unclear whether Trump’s executive order will affect the new pact in any way or further delay negotiations. 'The allegations made in the executive order can significantly complicate getting the agreement renewed,' Isabel Bosman, a nuclear energy researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs, told Reuters. According to Zizamele Mbambo, a senior energy department official, the new agreement is almost ready, but it hasn’t been signed yet because legal processes are still ongoing. 'As far as we know, both sides remain firmly committed to concluding this new agreement,' Mbambo said.

Foreign funding of judicial-reform protests spurs Knesset legisla...	Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved a bill on Sunday to impose an 80% tax on donations from foreign entities to Israeli non-profits. By David Isaac, JNS As billionaire Elon Musk and his youthful team of tech wizards tear through America’s administrative state, exposing waste and misuse of funds, reports emerged that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funded judicial-reform protests in Israel. While this would constitute a blatant case of U.S. interference in Israel’s internal affairs, the way in which funds bounce from one group to another before reaching their final target makes it difficult to produce hard evidence.Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved a bill on Sunday to impose an 80% tax on donations from foreign entities to Israeli non-profits. However, reports of heavy foreign funding of key groups opposed to the Israeli government’s plan to reform the judiciary led Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself to weigh in last week in a Knesset speech, blasting what he called the 'almost inconceivable' amounts of foreign money that drove the protest movement. Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved a bill on Sunday to impose an 80% tax on donations from foreign entities to Israeli non-profits. Currently, those donations are tax-free. The heart of the current debate is Blue and White Future, an Israeli NGO that funded and ran the headquarters for the coalition of groups opposing judicial reform. A significant percentage of its funding came from foreign sources. The HQ’s website lists some half-dozen protest groups supported by Blue and White Future, including Achim L’Neshek ('Brothers in Arms'), which called for reservists to refuse service, and Bonot Alternativa ('Women Building an Alternative'), which introduced Handmaid’s Tale costumes to the protests. The key figures in Blue and White Future are Orni Petruschka, a high-tech entrepreneur; Ami Ayalon, a former head of the Internal Security Service (Shin Bet); and Gilead Sher, an attorney who served as chief of staff and policy coordinator to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, one of the most vociferous of Netanyahu’s opponents. Blue and White Future was founded in 2009 as Blue and White Peace. Its initial purpose was to 'enhance and highlight' public support for the two-state solution. It changed its name by the end of that year to Blue and White Future and then its raison d’être in January 2023 (when Justice Minister Yariv Levin announced the government’s judicial-reform plan), saying its new goal was 'to preserve the democratic character of the State of Israel.' In September 2023, it hired Washington-based PR firm Trident DMG, for a three-month contract of $75,000 for 'strategic communications services' to boost its cause in the United States. It would have found a ready ear in the then-Biden administration, which made no secret of its opposition to the judicial-reform plan. U.S. President Joe Biden himself spoke out against it several times in 2023. Blue and White Future’s financials, filed with Israel’s Registrar of Associations, show that the NGO received a major shot of money in 2023, with donations jumping to 134 million shekels (~$38 million) from 824,730 shekels ($232,000) in 2022. Its budget in previous years hovered in that lower range. In 2023, it spent most of its budget, or $31 million, on opposition to judicial reform. Approximately 54%, or 83 million shekels (~$23 million), of the donations came from foreign sources and 71 million shekels (~$20 million) from within Israel. Of the foreign funds, 78 million shekels came from two American nonprofits: the Middle East Peace Dialogue Network (MEDPN)—14 million shekels (~$4 million) and PEF Israel Endowment Funds—64 million shekels (~$18 million). The MEDPN receives funds from NGOs that were given U.S. government funds. But it’s impossible to trace the origin of the money, as it’s already too far removed from the source. For instance, USAID gives to Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, Inc., which donates to the Jewish Communal Fund, which in turn donates to MEDPN, according to DataRepublican, a website that tracks taxpayer funds. PEF Israel’s receipt of U.S. taxpayer funds is negligible. It received $149,000 in indirect government monies, or 0.5% of its total contributions of $281 million in 2023, DataRepublican reported. The torrent of U.S. taxpayer money streaming out of U.S. government coffers and adding to America’s $2 trillion deficit is what the Trump administration wants to bring under control. In a Feb. 11 press conference, Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), joined President Donald Trump at the Oval Office to discuss his efforts. He noted that many payments his team found didn’t have a categorization code or description of what the payments were for, meaning there was no way to track them. There is a 'massive number' of such checks 'flying out of the building,' Musk said. With such few basic controls, it seems unlikely that Musk’s team will uncover a smoking gun pointing to USAID grants going to Israeli NGOs. However, Knesset Member Yitzhak Kroizer of the Otzma Yehudit Party, who wrote to Musk on Feb. 16 requesting a meeting to discuss the misuse of U.S. taxpayer funds in Israel, expressed cautious optimism that much could be uncovered. 'It will be very difficult to track all the money,' Kroizer told JNS. 'But we will be able to identify fund transfers from certain entities, parties and nonprofits and how it flows from the United States to groups in Israel.' Kroizer is interested in exposing the mechanism by which the funds are piped in, not specific dollar amounts, noting that the names of the associations change but the methods remain the same. 'They find the same ways each time to transfer the funds,' he said. The U.S. has a history of interfering in Israeli politics, along with certain European countries, he added. 'It’s the same countries all the time.' In May 2023, a bill that would have significantly limited the amount that Israeli NGOs could receive from foreign governments was dropped after harsh criticism from the United States, Germany and France. By protesting the bill, those countries were 'probably' pointing a guilty finger at themselves, Kroizer said. In his letter to Musk, he noted, 'It is well known in both Israel and the United States that past administrations have used American funds to exert improper influence in Israeli affairs. The 2015 incident involving OneVoice and VI5—organizations that received funding from the Obama administration while working to oppose the Netanyahu government—left a lasting negative impression.' Kroizer was referring to the scandal in which a U.S. Senate subcommittee found that the Obama administration’s State Department had donated about $350,000 to a group trying to defeat Netanyahu in the 2015 Israeli elections. The Knesset passed a law the following year requiring nonprofits that receive more than half their funding from abroad to disclose it each year to the NGO Registrar at the Justice Ministry. The United States expressed its concern with that law, too, with the Obama administration’s Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro meeting with the law’s sponsor, then-Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked. A U.S. embassy statement released after the meeting put in diplomatic language American displeasure, saying Shapiro 'reiterated' the United States’ view that 'a free and functioning civil society is an essential element of a healthy democracy, and that governments must protect free expression and peaceful dissent and create an atmosphere where all voices can be heard.' It remains to be seen whether the current proposed Knesset bill, whose stated purpose is 'to reduce the indirect influence of foreign government and political entities on the State of Israel'—if it becomes law—will have better luck than previous efforts to sharply cut outside activity in shaping Israeli politics.

Terrorists behind Nova massacre had planned to take over city	Israeli army's investigation into the security failures during the October 7th invasion of Israel reveal that terrorist forces which conducted massacre at music festival had arrived there by accident - and had actually planned to take over a nearby city. By World Israel News Staff The most deadly massacre carried out by Gazan terrorists during their invasion of Israel on October 7th was the result in part of a navigational error by the terrorists, who had planned a potentially larger attack on a nearby Israeli city. On Monday, Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, revealed that the Israeli military probe into the invasion found that the terrorists who carried out the Nova music festival massacre outside Kibbutz Re'im on the morning of October 7th had actually targeted the city of Netivot. The Nova massacre, the deadliest massacre of October 7th, leaving over 360 people dead and 44 taken hostage, was carried out by a force of 100 to 120 terrorists from Hamas' Nuseirat Brigade. The terrorist force crossed over from Gaza into Israeli territory during the second wave of attacks at 7:30 a.m., approximately an hour after the initial attacks. The Nuseirat force entered Israeli territory in 14 pickup trucks and two motorcycles, the report said, and was armed with two heavy machine guns, three smaller machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, assault rifles, and grenades. The terrorists had been assigned to capture the city of Netivot, but during the invasion the force lost its bearings, eventually stumbling upon the Nova festival outside of Kibbutz Rei'm instead, an hour and a half after the force entered Israeli territory. Had the terrorists succeeded into locating Netivot, located five kilometers northeast of Kibbutz Re'im and the Nova festival, the city would have been the most populous Israeli community to face Gazan invaders on October 7th. Home to roughly 52,000 people in 2023, Netivot is significantly larger than the the two cities invaded on October 7th: Ofakim, with a population of 35,000, and Sderot, home to 33,000.

Lawmakers who back Hamas are ‘sicker’ than the terrorists, says H...	The putative U.S. ambassador to Israel also put the military option on the table regarding the president’s absolute opposition to a nuclear Iran. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, slammed Congressional supporters of Hamas and said Iran is under definite threat of attack if it doesn’t give up its nuclear ambitions in an interview Monday on Fox News’ Varney and Co. show. After citing the Hamas-led massacre of 1,200 people and taking of 250 hostages during its October 7, 2023, invasion of Israel that immediately sparked war in the Gaza Strip, interviewer Stuart Varney expressed surprise that the terror organization could still have backers in Congress. Without mentioning any names, Huckabee responded, 'It’s beyond comprehension that anybody would understand what Hamas did, what they continue to do, the threats they continue to make as recently as a week ago, saying they want to have another October 7, and somehow show support for that.' While the terrorists 'are very sick people,' he added, 'the sicker ones' are 'the ones who know what they did&#8230;some of whom even serve in Congress, and think it was OK – or at least think it was justified.' In the immediate aftermath of the massacre in southern Israel, Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) blamed Israel for the slaughter, saying that its 'apartheid system' creates 'conditions that can lead to resistance.' She and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have repeatedly falsely accused Israel of breaking international law and committing genocide, while ignoring Hamas’ documented war crimes. Tlaib has also employed at least three individuals with Hamas connections and was called out as a 'Hamas sympathizer' by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries after she repeated a lie about the IDF attacking a hospital early on in the war when it was struck by a failed Palestinian missile launched at Israel. Huckabee praised Trump’s firm support of the Jewish state while calling the former president Joe Biden’s policy towards the Israel and Hamas 'schizophrenic.' 'One day, he’s all for Israel. The next day, he puts more pressure on them to have a ceasefire than he did on Hamas to release American hostages. This was insane, and it’s cost us a lot of time, money, and human lives,' he said. Regarding Iran’s nuclear program, Varney ran a clip of National Security Advisor Mike Waltz saying that Trump has been very clear that the Islamic Republic 'can never have a nuclear weapon,' since it was 'an irrational actor that we cannot allow to have their finger on the button.' He then asked Huckabee, 'Doesn’t it sound to you like an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is coming?' The future ambassador answered, 'Either that or they’re going to surrender it, they’re not going to get one.' He said 'everyone else in the entire world who has a brain' is 'giving a standing ovation to that doctrine,' including the Arab countries in the region. 'They all understand that Israel is no threat to them, they don’t have to worry that Israel is going to launch an attack on Egypt or Jordan or the Saudis. They’re worried about Iran,' he continued. 'And whether it’s Israel that pulls the trigger, or it’s a combination of nations, I hope the Iranian leaders, as crazed as they are, have at least enough sense to listen carefully to what’s being said. They’re not going to have a nuclear weapon, full stop.'

Israel accuses Egypt of breaking 1979 peace treaty with Sinai bui...	Israeli Ambassador to US warns Egypt's military buildup in the Sinai Peninsula constitutes a 'very serious violation' of the 1979 peace treaty brokered by President Jimmy Carter. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior Israeli diplomat has accused Egypt of violating the landmark peace treaty between the two countries by militarizing the Sinai Peninsula. Late last month, Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Yehiel Leiter, addressed a gathering of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's meeting with President Donald Trump in the White House. A video of Leiter's address during the event was published on Friday, only to be later removed. During his remarks, Leiter blasted Egypt for militarizing the Sinai Peninsula, a move that if verified would constitute a 'very serious violation,' Leiter said. In 1979, then-President Jimmy Carter brokered the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty, ending 31 years of hostilities and establishing full relations between the two countries. The agreement, which was predicated on Israel's return of the entire Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, imposed strict limits on Cairo's rights to deploy armed forces to the Sinai, including a single armored division in the Suez Canal Zone, four battalions of border police in Central Sinai, with no military presence in the Eastern Sinai, facing the Israeli frontier. Beginning in 2013, Israel has approved temporary deployments of Egyptian forces in the Central and Eastern Sinai to combat Islamist forces in the Peninsula, or to curb Hamas smuggling into the Gaza Strip. However, according to Leiter, Egypt is now constructing military facilities in the Sinai with clear offensive military capabilities. 'There are bases being built, and they can only be used for offensive operations and offensive weapons,' Leiter said. 'This is a clear violation. For a long time, this issue has been shoved to the side, but it continues. This is an issue that we are going to put on the table – very soon and very emphatically.' During the 46 years since the treaty was inked, Israel has never before accused Egypt of violating the deal, which marked the first time an Arab state ended a state of war with Israel and established full relations. Last week, Yuval Steinitz, a former Strategic Affairs Minister under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who now chairs the Israeli arms manufacturer Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, said Egypt's buildup in the Sinai is a cause for concern. 'There is definitely reason to view Egypt’s military buildup with concern,' Steinitz told Yedioth Aharanoth. 'Relations between Israel and Egypt are currently stable, but if one day we become weak, everyone in the region will seize the opportunity.'

‘Trump, you’re my hope’ – Freed hostage to US president	I beg you, don’t stop until all the hostages, the living and the dead, are brought home,' Berger said in a heartfelt plea. By World Israel News Staff Former Hamas hostage Agam Berger thanked President Donald J. Trump in a video posted on social media, crediting him with securing her release from captivity and stressing the importance of continuing the hostage deal. Berger, who was kidnapped from the Nahal Oz base adjacent to the Gaza Strip on October 7th, 2023, was released in late January after being held by the terror group for nearly 15 months. In the video, Berger thanked Trump 'from the bottom of my heart for all you have done and all that you continue to do for the hostages.' Addressing Trump, Berger emphasized that 'because of you, we came home.' Breaking: Former hostage Agam Berger, who was just released from captivity, thanks @POTUS Trump for his efforts to free the hostages. 'There are a lot of people whose lives depends on you, you're their only hope. I suffered a lot, others are still there suffering'. @SteveWitkoff pic.twitter.com/ozQJCrsEcj &mdash; Neria Kraus (@NeriaKraus) February 18, 2025 She added that there are additional hostages in Gaza 'who really depend on you and are waiting for you to save them from there.' She stressed that Trump 'has the power to' save the rest of the hostages, whom she said are suffering every day they remain in captivity. 'I beg you, don’t stop until all the hostages, the living and the dead, are brought home,' Berger said in a heartfelt plea. Trump reposted the video without comment on his Truth Social platform. Berger was one of five female observation soldiers recently released by the terror group, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Keith Siegel, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, recently released a video thanking Trump after he was released from captivity earlier in February. 'President Trump, you are the reason I am home alive,' Siegel said in the video. 'You are the reason I was reunited with my beloved wife, four children and five grandchildren.' Like Berger, Siegel beseeched Trump to ensure the ceasefire holds until the hostage deal is completed. 'I trust in your strength and leadership Mr. President,' Siegel said. 'The helpless hostages in the dark, cold tunnels in Gaza also trust you. Please bring them home.'

‘All options on the table’ for stopping Iran’s nuke program, says...	Michael Waltz, President Trump's National Security Advisor, says the president is 'dead serious' about preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, says 'all options are on the table' to block Tehran's nuclear ambitions. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration is committed to prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, a top administration official said Sunday, hinting that the U.S. is considering military intervention to prevent Iran's nuclear program from reaching break-out capacity. On Sunday, President Donald Trump's National Security Advisor, former Congressman Michael Waltz, appeared on Fox News warning that Trump is 'dead serious' about preventing Iran from going nuclear and that 'all options are on the table' to prevent Tehran from achieving weapons-grade enrichment. 'I could speak to what the President has repeatedly said, and that is Iran can never have a nuclear weapon,' Waltz said. 'That not only would be existential for Israel. I think it would be existential for the entire world, because it could kick off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.' Waltz refused to speak directly to what proposals are on the table for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, saying only that Trump has shown he is ready to take 'whatever action is necessary.' 'How we get there, I'm not going to get into the details of here, but the President has also expressed a willingness to take whatever action is necessary.' 'All options are on the table, but also to talk to Iran as well, if they want to give up their entire program and not play games, as we have seen Iran do in the past in prior negotiations.' 'So all options are on the table, but I'll promise you this: President Trump is absolutely serious, deadly serious, when he says Iran can never have a nuke, and certainly not on President Trump's watch. They are an irrational actor that we cannot allow to have their finger on the button.' During President Joe Biden's lame duck session following the election of Donald Trump last November, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan briefed Biden on possible options for military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, should Iran attempt to rush towards development of a nuclear weapon prior to Trump's inauguration last month. Israel is reportedly considering airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities sometime over the next few months, U.S. intel officials estimate.

The eastern part of Oregon is ideologically at odds with the urban and progressive areas of the state, as evidenced by the intensity of anti-police protests in Portland in 2020. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Conservative eastern Oregon has proposed to secede from the state and become part of the neighboring red state of Idaho. The eastern part of Oregon is ideologically at odds with the urban and progressive areas of the state, as evidenced by the intensity of anti-police protests in Portland in 2020. 'The Greater Idaho Movement has always been about the people of Eastern Oregon getting their voices heard and helping those communities get the kind of state-level governance they actually want,' Executive Director Matt McCaw told Fox News Digital. 'If the Oregon Legislature truly believes in democracy, they will honor those voters' wishes and move forward on making a border change happen.' Earlier this month, State Rep. Mark Owens (R-Malheur) introduced HB 3844, a bill that establishes a task force to assess the impact of moving the Idaho border to include approximately 13 eastern Oregon counties. The measure also mandates that a report be submitted to lawmakers in Salem. The Greater Idaho Movement began sponsoring measures in favor of secession during the Portland riots in 2020, and calls to join Idaho have grown louder as the ideological divisions persist. In 2020, Portland was nearly at a standstill during a violent standoff in front of the Mark Hatfield Federal Courthouse that lasted for days. Greater Idaho President Mike McCarter commented on the proposal: 'We are encouraged to see the representatives of Eastern Oregon coming together to advocate for their voters by bringing these bills to the Legislature. The people of Eastern Oregon have made it clear they want to explore moving the border and joining Idaho.' 'This movement has always been about the people of Eastern Oregon getting their voices heard and helping those communities get the kind of state-level governance they actually want.' Although similar calls to secede from one state and join another have rarely been successful, there are other proposals in various parts of the United States. For instance, a number of conservative, rural communities in Illinois are seeking to disassociate themselves from progressive Chicago and join neighboring red state Indiana. For decades, Staten Island has sought to secede from New York City, and despite a 2-to-1 vote by the residents to secede, the measure was quashed by New York State's Democratic Party.

Although Israel informed then-U.S. President Biden about the recordings, the Biden administration still pressured Israel to send hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza daily. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Recordings of conversations between Hamas officials prove that the humanitarian aid entering Gaza in 2024 went directly to Hamas, Channel 12 revealed this week. Although Israel informed then-U.S. President Biden about the recordings, the Biden Administration still pressured Israel to send hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza daily. The recordings also provided further evidence of Hamas' close ties with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). In one recording, a Hamas member said, 'Currently, monitoring is in progress, and we will receive updates. There are confirmed injuries, including some UNRWA employees. Two of the injured are police officers.' In another conversation, junior Hamas members complained they were not receiving aid, and in response, they were told their wives had been attacked in a Rafah mosque. 'They enter the women’s room and beat them,' the Hamas members were heard saying. 'We will redeem our people with our soul and our blood.' One source responded to the incident by stating, 'The leadership is not involved and has been monitoring the situation from the very beginning.' The conversation also revealed anger at senior Hamas officials over their corrupt behavior. A junior Hamas member stated, 'I promise you, we will tear you to pieces. Make sure the leadership in Khan Yunis hears this too. We will tear you apart. You’re only focused on yourselves. There is no real leadership.' He continued, 'All the leaders in Khan Yunis should hang their heads in shame, as they are not men. They invade women's rooms and assault them there. Everyone must understand that our honor is far more valuable than our lives.' Gazan civilians have repeatedly claimed that Hamas steals humanitarian aid and keeps it for themselves or sells it at exorbitant prices. In a recorded conversation, a Palestinian man in Gaza told an IDF soldier that Hamas was stealing UNRWA humanitarian aid. He said, 'The situation is terrible because the people responsible for the humanitarian aid are thieves.' 'Hamas has their hands on UNRWA administration workers and controls UNRWA,' he explained.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich signed an additional lien of 320 million shekels in Palestinian Authority (PA) funds on Monday. This was the latest in a series of liens that freeze designated PA funds to prevent them from being used to finance terrorism. The money will be used instead to compensate victims of terror. Smotrich stated, 'There is no more just and righteous action than stopping the Palestinian Authority from financing terrorism and redirecting its funds to support the families of terror victims. This is a crucial step in our national fight against terrorism and the Palestinian Authority that fosters it.' He continued, 'This action aligns with the Gaza payroll deductions, the halt on payments to terrorists, and numerous other measures I’ve implemented as part of the unwavering policy I've consistently followed since taking office. We are cutting off the sources of funding for terrorism and preventing the Palestinian Authority from using its funds to fuel incitement and violence. I will continue to take decisive action to ensure the security of Israel's citizens.' Last month, Israel recovered funds to cover a decade-old $1.1 billion Palestinian Authority electricity debt by redirecting money from the Norwegian Fund, where PA funds have been deposited since the beginning of the war. The Finance Ministry issued an order to the Norwegian Fund, which had been receiving 275 million shekels monthly, deducted from PA funds. The money from the Norwegian Fund will be used to settle outstanding debts the PA has owed to Israel for over 10 years. Half of the funds will go to companies that provided fuel to the PA; the other half will be directed to Israel’s electric company. Last spring, after Norway announced its recognition of a Palestinian state, Smotrich halted payments to the Norwegian Fund and redirected the funds to a new account. Instead of transferring money to the Palestinian Authority after the war, Israel will now use the funds to pay off the PA’s debts to Israel.

With 21 staff members having lost immediate family members and hundreds serving as reservists, it’s the unseen bravery of these heroes that keeps Gozlan and her team working 500 days later. By Jewish Breaking News Dawn hadn’t yet broken over Jerusalem when the first casualties began arriving at Hadassah’s emergency rooms on October 7, 2023. The hospital staff didn’t know it then, but they were about to treat victims of the deadliest attack on Israeli soil in decades, even as some of their own loved ones were caught in the violence. Lilach Gozlan, head of staff welfare at Hadassah, remWith 21 staff members having lost immediate family members and hundreds serving as reservists, it’s the unseen bravery of these heroes that keeps Gozlan and her team working 500 days later.embers those first days vividly. When she learned that one employee’s family had fallen into financial crisis after losing a relative at Nova, she knew they had to act. 'We couldn’t leave them alone, helpless,' she says. The hospital’s initial response looked a lot like triage. They set up a welfare fund. They mobilized 500 volunteers to call every single employee, paying special attention to the 86 staff members living within range of Gaza. However, money and phone calls were just the beginning. Children were another immediate concern. With schools closed and parents needed at the hospital, Hadassah’s welfare department transformed protected spaces near the hospital into makeshift daycare centers. Pre-army volunteers and professional staff cared for up to 200 kids, from newborns to 12-year-olds, running from early morning until late afternoon. Then came the military call-ups. Over 400 Hadassah employees joined the reserves, along with nearly 500 of their family members. When these workers started returning to their hospital jobs, the cracks began to show. Some of them couldn’t shake what they’d seen. 'In COVID there was a set formula, we’d send food packages to those affected and so on,' Gozlan explains. 'But there were no procedures for October 7 and what’s happened since.' Yet the hospital kept adapting. They brought in experts for webinars on trauma. They trained managers on how to support returning soldiers. They worked to keep peace between Jewish and Arab staff members. They even brought in performers to lift spirits. With 21 staff members having lost immediate family members and hundreds serving as reservists, it’s the unseen bravery of these heroes that keeps Gozlan and her team working 500 days later. They’re still distributing aid packages, still providing counseling, and still making sure no one falls through the cracks.

Hamas expected to return bodies of several hostages on Thursday	Meanwhile, Ynet reported on Monday night that Israel is demanding the freedom of six living hostages instead of the agreed three during the seventh release scheduled for Saturday. By JNS Jerusalem is preparing to receive the bodies of four or five hostages on Thursday who were murdered in captivity in the Gaza Strip, Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster reported on Monday. The ceasefire deal with the Palestinian terrorist group stipulates that the bodies of four hostages will be returned to the Jewish state on the 33rd day of the ceasefire, which went into effect Jan. 19, an Israeli official told Walla news. According to Kan News, Hamas is scheduled to hand over the names of the slain captives on Thursday morning. Israeli military ambulances will collect the bodies at a meeting point, from where they will be brought to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. Officials involved in the preparations stressed that the hostages’ families will only be informed after the identification process is completed. Meanwhile, Ynet reported on Monday night that Israel is demanding the freedom of six living hostages during the seventh release scheduled for Saturday. According to the deal, Hamas is required to release three captives. In exchange for releasing the additional hostages, the Israeli government has signaled its willingness to allow the entry of hundreds of additional caravans into the Strip, the report claimed. The three latest returnees from Hamas captivity in Gaza were reunited on Saturday with their families—American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36; Alexander ('Sasha') Troufanov, 29, who has dual Russian-Israeli citizenship; and Argentine-Israeli national Iair Horn, 46. Saturday’s release was the sixth such round under phase one of the ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump’s leadership and Israel’s coordination with the United States on Saturday, highlighting that the reinforcement of IDF troops around Gaza and the U.S. president’s firm stance led to the release of three hostages despite Hamas’s threats to delay the exchange. Trump on Saturday congratulated the freed hostages but made clear that their release fell short of his call to free all the captives. 'Hamas has just released three Hostages from GAZA, including an American Citizen. They seem to be in good shape! This differs from their [Hamas’s] statement last week that they would not release any Hostages,' he wrote on his Truth Social social media platform. 'Israel will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O’CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES. The United States will back the decision they make!' he added, apparently referring to U.S. Eastern Time, or 7 p.m. in Israel. Trump’s deadline was a reference to his previous warning that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed if Hamas did not release all of the hostages. According to official estimates, 73 hostages remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza after 500 days, including 70 abducted during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

500 days in captivity: Knesset hears of released hostages’ ongoin...	These are captivity survivors who have endured life-altering experiences that will leave them with lifelong scars,' said Professor Hagai Levine, who has been actively accompanying the families since the beginning of the war. By Sveta Listratov, TPS As Israelis marked the 500th day of captivity for the hostages in Gaza, lawmakers of the Knesset’s Health Committee gathered on Monday to hear about the medical and psychological state of those who have returned. 'It is crucial to hear the entire truth about the situation of those who have returned from Gaza and their families. The testimonies we have heard here are important,' said MK Tatiana Mazarsky of Yesh Atid, who initiated the committee meeting. 'It is difficult to expose the trauma, and that’s why the world doesn’t care about our suffering. They don’t see our pain. They think we are only attackers. We must not remain silent. We must show what we are going through.' The session included emotional testimony from the families of returnees and the medical professionals involved in the rehabilitation. Shemi Kalderon, whose 54-year-old nephew Ofer was held captive and released a few weeks ago, shared his nephew’s health condition. Ofer was hospitalized for several days after his return due to a severe flu and pneumonia. 'Three months ago, Ofer weighed 25 kilos less than today. He said that in the tunnel where he was held, there was a scale. When they realized he would be among the released hostages, and saw how he looked, he had been fed rotten vegetables. He hadn’t seen daylight for 484 days. He had no access to a shower, maybe once every two or three months, all that aside from the physical injuries he endured,' Kalderon shared. Carmit Palty Katzir insisted to lawmakers that it is impossible for her, her family, and the entire nation to heal the wounds at this time. 'We are still at war; it’s the 500th of October for us today. Until the last hostage returns, we will not heal,' she declared. Her father was murdered at Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7 while her mother Hanna and brother Elad were taken to Gaza. Hanna was released during a temporary ceasefire in November 2023, but died of health complications from her captivity the following year. Soldiers recovered Elad’s body in April 2024. 'It is a disgrace and a shame that we have reached day 500. Everywhere I go, I feel compelled to warn that there are helpless people in captivity we must save,' Palty Katzir said. Families of returning hostages have previously described physical abuse, torture, and psychological pressure their loved ones went through, while images of emaciated returnees shocked Israelis. Professor Hagai Levine, who has been actively accompanying the families since the beginning of the war, described the situation with hostages as unprecedented in Israel. 'These are captivity survivors who have endured life-altering experiences that will leave them with lifelong scars,' he said, calling for comprehensive, systematic research into their condition. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi of the Health Ministry told lawmakers, 'Even if some may look fine on the outside, the hospital tests often reveal hidden damage.' She stressed the need for sustained, individualized care for each returning captive and said the ministry will work 'hand in hand' with the survivors and their families for years to come. Michal Mizrahi from Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital, echoed the need for long-term support, detailing the condition of four hostages the hospital treated, who have been held underground for extended periods. 'They suffered from muscle atrophy, drastic weight loss, and vitamin deficiencies,' she reported, stressing that rehabilitation is focused on restoring physical capabilities, with continuous evaluation and nutritional support. The committee acknowledged significant improvements in the health system work with hostages, but recognized persistent gaps, including the need for better mental health services, long-term financial support, and addressing the needs of secondary victims—children, siblings, and caregivers of the surviving hostages.

IDF nabs terrorists, seizes weapons, cash in Judea and Samaria	During another operation in the Ephraim Brigade area of responsibility, which covers the Tulkarem and Qalqilya sectors in western Samaria, forces arrested a terrorism suspect and seized an M-16 rifle and two handguns. By JNS Israeli security forces arrested Palestinian terrorists while seizing arms and funds during overnight raids throughout Judea and Samaria on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces said. The IDF, Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and Israel Police 'continue to operate throughout Judea and Samaria to thwart terrorism in order to maintain the security of the citizens of the State of Israel,' the army said on Monday. In Deir Abu Mash’al, 15 miles west of Ramallah and close to the Samaria security barrier across from Ben-Gurion International Airport, troops detained seven suspects. Meanwhile, in Al-Arroub, near Bethlehem in Judea, two were arrested. At the same time, Israel’s security agencies continue 'Operation Iron Wall' to thwart terror in the northern part of Samaria, the IDF said. 'Overnight, forces located and confiscated a number of weapons in Jenin, and destroyed a number of explosive devices in Tulkarem,' according to the military. During another operation in the Ephraim Brigade area of responsibility, which covers the Tulkarem and Qalqilya sectors in western Samaria, forces arrested a terrorism suspect and seized an M-16 rifle and two handguns. In the Arab village of Osarin, located near Nablus in the IDF’s Samaria Brigade deployment area, one wanted terrorist was arrested. The Israeli government recorded thousands of Palestinian terrorist attacks against Jews in 2024—including many in Judea and Samaria. Earlier this month, the IDF expanded 'Operation Iron Wall,' saying it plans to form a new battalion that will remain in Jenin and Tulkarem after the counter-terrorism operation. In January, an unnamed senior security force told Israel’s Channel 14 News broadcaster that the large-scale campaign against Iranian-backed terrorist organizations in northern Samaria could take several months. 'When it ends, the terror camps will cease to exist. What we did in Gaza, we will do to them as well; we will leave them in ruins,' the source said.

IDF confirms it will remain in five Lebanon outposts after deadli...	In addition to its continued presence in Lebanon, the IDF is working to build forward operating outposts near every border town. Construction of the outposts has already started and many have already been built. By JNS Israel Defense Forces soldiers will remain deployed at five outposts in Southern Lebanon beyond the Feb. 18 deadline set out in the truce deal with Beirut, the army’s Northern Command confirmed on Monday. Israel’s decision to keep boots on the ground in Lebanon was made in conjunction with the Trump administration. The company-size posts, located within several hundred meters of the border, will be manned by hundreds of IDF soldiers until the political echelon decides otherwise. The five outposts are located at a hill near Labbouneh, opposite the Israeli border town of Shlomi; on the Jabal Blat peak, opposite Moshav Zar’it; on a hill opposite Moshav Avivim and Kibbutz Malkia; on a hill opposite Moshav Margaliot; and on a hill opposite the town of Metula. The IDF is taking into account that Hezbollah terrorists may attempt to damage the outposts—which are all located outside of built-up areas—and is preparing for expected provocations against troops. Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem warned Israel on Sunday that if it does not withdraw its forces by Tuesday, 'we will know how to deal with it. 'Israel must fully withdraw on February 18, it has no excuse,' the top terrorist leader said in a televised speech cited by the France 24 outlet. תום תקופת המבחן בלבנון מחר: בפיקוד הצפון נערכים לסוף תקופת היישום להפסקת האש בלבנון, כולל נסיגה של כוחות צה'ל, מלבד חמישה מוצבים שנבנו בשטח לבנון כפי שפרסמנו בשבוע שעבר במשך חודשיים וחצי, כך אומרים בפיקוד הצפון, לוחמי צה'ל פעלו בדרום לבנון למקסם את ההישג שהגיעו אליהם במהלך… pic.twitter.com/3B6aqR74rv &mdash; איתי בלומנטל Itay Blumental (@ItayBlumental) February 17, 2025 In addition to its continued presence in Lebanon, the IDF is working to build forward operating outposts near every border town. Construction of the outposts has already started and many have already been built. If the relative calm on the border with Lebanon is preserved, residents of evacuated communities in northern Israel will be able to return to their homes on the planned date of March 1, the IDF statement said. The truce with Lebanon, which took effect on Nov. 27, mandated an IDF redeployment within 60 days. However, the U.S.-monitored agreement is expected to continue until Feb. 18, the White House said on Jan. 26. Under the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, the IDF is to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon as the Lebanese Armed Forces and U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon assume responsibility for ensuring Hezbollah remains disarmed in the country’s south. However, there have been growing doubts in Jerusalem that the LAF can fulfill its obligation to clamp down on Hezbollah’s presence. The Israeli army remains engaged in frequent operations in the area. On Sunday, IDF troops destroyed an underground tunnel system near the border that was used by the terrorist group’s elite Radwan Unit and contained 'living quarters and combat equipment,' the military said. In recent weeks, soldiers from the 810th 'Mountain' Brigade, under the command of the 210th 'Bashan' Division, completed dozens of targeted raids in Southern Lebanon’s Mount Dov area to 'remove threats facing the State of Israel and its citizens,' according to the IDF statement.

The eastern part of Oregon is ideologically at odds with the urban and progressive areas of the state, as evidenced by the intensity of anti-police protests in Portland in 2020. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Conservative eastern Oregon has proposed to secede from the state and become part of the neighboring red state of Idaho. The eastern part of Oregon is ideologically at odds with the urban and progressive areas of the state, as evidenced by the intensity of anti-police protests in Portland in 2020. 'The Greater Idaho Movement has always been about the people of Eastern Oregon getting their voices heard and helping those communities get the kind of state-level governance they actually want,' Executive Director Matt McCaw told Fox News Digital. 'If the Oregon Legislature truly believes in democracy, they will honor those voters' wishes and move forward on making a border change happen.' Earlier this month, State Rep. Mark Owens (R-Malheur) introduced HB 3844, a bill that establishes a task force to assess the impact of moving the Idaho border to include approximately 13 eastern Oregon counties. The measure also mandates that a report be submitted to lawmakers in Salem. The Greater Idaho Movement began sponsoring measures in favor of secession during the Portland riots in 2020, and calls to join Idaho have grown louder as the ideological divisions persist. In 2020, Portland was nearly at a standstill during a violent standoff in front of the Mark Hatfield Federal Courthouse that lasted for days. Greater Idaho President Mike McCarter commented on the proposal: 'We are encouraged to see the representatives of Eastern Oregon coming together to advocate for their voters by bringing these bills to the Legislature. The people of Eastern Oregon have made it clear they want to explore moving the border and joining Idaho.' 'This movement has always been about the people of Eastern Oregon getting their voices heard and helping those communities get the kind of state-level governance they actually want.' Although similar calls to secede from one state and join another have rarely been successful, there are other proposals in various parts of the United States. For instance, a number of conservative, rural communities in Illinois are seeking to disassociate themselves from progressive Chicago and join neighboring red state Indiana. For decades, Staten Island has sought to secede from New York City, and despite a 2-to-1 vote by the residents to secede, the measure was quashed by New York State's Democratic Party.

Comedian Dave Chappelle ends show with ‘Free Palestine’ slogan	Comedian and actor Dave Chappelle accuses Saturday Night Live of barring him from talking about the situation in the Gaza Strip, ends stand-up comedy show by declaring 'Give the Jews a break, free Palestine.' By World Israel News Staff Stand-up comedian and actor Dave Chappelle accused the producers of Saturday Night Live of censoring him during his recent appearance on the show, barring him from discussing the situation in the Gaza Strip. During a stand-up comedy show in San Francisco last week, the 51-year-old said that he had been explicitly warned ahead of his January 18th appearance on SNL not to raise either Gaza or transgenderism, SFGate reported. Nevertheless, Chappelle did allude to the former during his monologue on the show. 'Do not forget your humanity, and please have empathy for displaced people whether they’re in the Palisades or Palestine,' Chappelle said. During last week's show in San Francisco, Chappelle made a more explicit political appeal on the issue, ending his show with the declaration: 'Give the Jews a break, free Palestine.' Chappelle, a convert to Islam, has in the past accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. Last May, during the IDF's ground operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, Chappelle had the song 'My Blood is Palestinian' by Mohammed Assaf played during a show in Abu Dhabi. As the audience began to chant 'Free Palestine,' Chappelle responded by calling Israel's war in Gaza an act of 'genocide.' In October 2023, shortly after the Hamas invasion of Israel, a number of audience members jeered Chappelle, with some leaving the event hall, after the comedian accused Israel of war crimes and slammed the Israeli government for initially closing off Israeli-supplied water and electricity to the Gaza Strip.

Elimination of Hamas still 2 years away, Israeli envoy says	Israel's New York consul-general said Israel will never accept a ‘terror state' in Gaza or Judea and Samaria, and knows it has full U.S. backing. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel’s consul-general in New York, Ofir Akunis, said that it will take another year or two to eliminate Hamas, and that the government knows it has full U.S. backing to reject a 'terror state' right on its borders, The New York Post reported Saturday. In an interview last week, the paper said, Akunis had compared the fight against Hamas to World War II. 'It will take time. We can stop [the war] after Hamas is not there — maybe it will take another year or two years. It took six years, six years for the Western world, to defeat Germany,' he observed. Akunis specifically mentioned that there were 'hundreds of miles' of terror tunnels still left under major portions of the Gaza Strip, that needed to be blocked up or destroyed. Leaving the majority in place through lack of choice, the IDF focused on blowing up only the most strategic tunnels while fighting the terrorist forces in the coastal enclave over 15 months of warfare, until a ceasefire went into effect last month. Akunis did not say that Israel would end the ceasefire and go back to fighting to get rid of Hamas, although U.S. President Donald Trump had given Israel the green light to do so last week. He did state that if the war does resume, it would 'look different' than before, without providing details. Israel knows it has full American backing with the current administration to do whatever would be necessary, the consul-general said, while making a point of praising Trump’s revolutionary idea to remove all the Gazans to other countries while the U.S. rebuilds the enclave. 'All of the international community must be open to new ideas,' he said of the reconstruction project, which could take a decade or more. With the exception so far of the UAE, the proposal has been generally rejected by the Arab world as well as several European countries, which have accused Trump of wanting to 'ethnically cleanse' Gaza and keep insisting that it must be part of a future Palestinian state. Israeli officials who enthusiastically support the incipient plan have said that Palestinians would be allowed to return but only if they believed in peaceful coexistence with the Jewish state. Akunis, a member of the Likud party, also made clear that he does not believe in giving the Palestinians a state of their own, especially after what Hamas did as rulers of the Strip over the last two decades. 'Gaza was a Palestinian state,' he noted. 'Do you think that the Israelis should accept the idea of the same terror state in Judea and Samaria and in the Gaza Strip again? The answer is no.'

Two Israeli-Arabs planning attacks for Hamas arrested	Investigators believe the brothers were preparing for a 'military confrontation' against Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Two brothers from the Israeli Arab city of Arraba were arrested and indicted for preparing to carry out a terror attack for Hamas, it was cleared for publication on Monday. The suspects, Yusef and Hadi Nasser, are accused of acquiring military equipment and learning to build explosive devices in preparation for a terror attack, the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) said. Investigators believe the brothers were preparing for a 'military confrontation' against Israel. This case is part of a broader effort by security forces to thwart attacks inspired by Hamas since the war began. Multiple investigations have been launched against Israeli citizens suspected of supporting terrorist activities. 'The General Security Service and the Israel Police view with great seriousness any involvement of Israeli citizens in activities that endanger the security of the state, and will continue to take the measures at their disposal to thwart any threat and act to bring all those involved to justice,' the Shin Bet said. The Haifa District Attorney’s Office has now filed indictments against the two for preparation for an act of terrorism, as well as training and instruction for terrorist purposes.

Cannabis brings relief to growing number of trauma victims post O...	Approximately 20,000 Israelis are already using medical cannabis for PTSD, representing 15% of the country’s medical cannabis prescriptions. By Jewish Breaking News As thousands of new PTSD cases emerge in the wake of October 7, promising research on cannabis treatment for trauma survivors has taken on new urgency. Following combat veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD, researchers at Tel Aviv University found significant symptom improvement in patients using medical cannabis, with more than 65% experiencing at least a 20% reduction in their PTSD symptoms. Notably, participants showed marked improvements in sleep quality and duration, along with reductions in intrusive thoughts and hyperarousal symptoms. Research shows that PTSD patients often have lower levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) that help regulate stress and emotional memories. THC, the primary active ingredient in cannabis, helps improve sleep quality, reduce nightmares, and lower anxiety in most cases. CBD, the non-intoxicating compound, reduces anxiety, counters potential negative effects of THC, and has calming properties. Together, they target brain areas involved in fear, memory, and stress response. 'What we’re seeing is particularly relevant given the current crisis,' Dr. Segal of medical cannabis producer Panaxia tells Globes. 'We see that this is a treatment that helps patients escape rather than resolve trauma, but that relief is also very important.' Approximately 20,000 Israelis are already using medical cannabis for PTSD, representing 15% of the country’s medical cannabis prescriptions. While the research shows promise, experts emphasize caution. Dr. Gilad Bodenheimer, head of mental health services at Israel’s Ministry of Health, cautions that it 'has not been proven to be a substance that is effective for PTSD,' adding that careful consideration is needed when prescribing any substance with potential risks. The brutal reality of October 7 has left thousands scarred for life, creating a mental health crisis of historic proportions. While no research can fully address trauma of this magnitude, the study’s findings about cannabis treatment offer at least a glimmer of hope for Israel’s traumatized survivors.

Hamas reportedly willing to hand over Gaza to Palestinian Authori...	Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas meets World Jewish Congress leader, pushing bid for Ramallah to take control over the Gaza Strip after Hamas reportedly agrees to cede the area. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization has agreed to yield control over the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian Authority, according to unnamed sources cited by Sky News Arabia in a report published Sunday night. The sources claimed that Hamas had told government employees in the Gaza Strip that they will be 're-absorbed into the new administration,' run by the Palestinian Authority, 'or that they would retire, with a guarantee that their salaries be paid.' Hamas is said to have agreed to surrender control over the coastal enclave to Ramallah following intense pressure from Egypt. The Egyptian government is said to have pressed a Hamas delegation during its recent trip to Cairo, in a bid to secure an alternative to President Donald Trump's plan to resettle the entire population in third-party countries, including Egypt and Jordan. The Palestinian Authority is also working to promote its rule of Gaza as an alternative to the Trump plan. On Sunday, Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas met with World Jewish Congress President Ron Lauder in Amman, Jordan. During their meeting, the PA mouthpiece WAFA reported, Abbas reiterated his opposition to the Trump plan, as well as to any possible transfer or mass migration of Arabs out of Judea and Samaria. Instead, Abbas argued, Ramallah should be charged with governing the post-war Gaza Strip, and called for increased international humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as well as aid to rebuild the coastal enclave. The Gaza Strip was administered by the Palestinian Authority from 1994, after Israel withdrew from parts of the Strip, until Hamas seized the area in 2007, defeating Fatah loyalists.

Eyal Zamir confirmed as Israeli military’s Chief of Staff	The last time chief of staff to leave the post before the end of his term was Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz, who resigned in 2007 over IDF failures during the Second Lebanon War of 2006. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli government gave its approval for the appointment of Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir as the next Israel Defense Forces chief of staff on Sunday. Zamir will replace Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, who announced on Jan. 21 he would resign over the military’s October 7 failures. Halevi is due to step down on March 5. Zamir, 59, was born and raised in Eilat. He would become the Chief of Staff to begin his career in the Armored Corps. After joining the army in 1984 he became a tank commander, gradually climbing the ranks. He was eventually appointed as Netanyahu’s military secretary from 2012-2015. From 2018 to 2021, he was deputy chief of staff before becoming a visiting research fellow at the Washington-based Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Zamir was also considered for the Chief of Staff in 2018 and 2022. In 2023, he was appointed Director General of the Defense Ministry. He also has degrees from Tel Aviv and Haifa Universities and is a graduate of Wharton University’s General Management Program. The IDF Chief of Staff serves for three years with the possibility of a one-year extension. The last time chief of staff to leave the post before the end of his term was Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz, who resigned in 2007 over IDF failures during the Second Lebanon War of 2006. There have been growing calls for the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to investigate political and military failures. Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. They may include personal recommendations about individuals under investigation, though the government is not bound to act on the recommendations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the governing coalition say an independent commission should only be appointed after the war. The last state commission of inquiry, which investigated Israel’s worst civilian disaster — a stampede that killed 45 people at a holy site on Mount Meron — held Netanyahu personally responsible for the tragedy in a report released in April.

Despairing of rescue, hostage prayed girlfriend would move on	Sasha Troufanov, released on Saturday, did not believe he’d survive Hamas captivity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Sapir Cohen, the partner of Sasha Troufanov who was freed on Saturday, told a press gathering Sunday night at Sheba Hospital that he had he had prayed she’d find someone else as he never expected to survive. 'Sasha told me that he prayed for me, that I would find a man I love, that I would not wait for him,' she relayed, voice shaking. 'He did not want me to wait for a man who would never come home. He did not believe that he would come out alive.' Troufanov spent his entire captivity alone, almost all of it in tunnels under Khan Yunis, where he was sometimes left chained in the dark. He was starved, and abused both physically and mentally. Cohen, whom Hamas terrorists had abducted along with Troufanov and his mother and grandmother from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7, 2023 invasion, said that since that day she has managed to 'fulfill dreams I never thought I’d have – to return alive from captivity in Gaza and to hug Sasha again.' The three women were released in the first hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, some seven weeks into the war, when 82 female and underage Israelis were freed over the course of a week in exchange for a temporary ceasefire, 246 Palestinian prisoners, and humanitarian aid that has flowed into the Strip ever since. Cohen thanked all the troops who fought in Gaza, and the families of the fallen, saying that 'to call you soldiers is to minimize what you do, a thousand-fold. You are role models who show what unity is, what solidarity is. Thank you for showing us that this is possible.' She also expressed special gratitude to everyone who gave strength and hope to the hostages’ families, 'each in their own way,' saying that she 'thanked God every day for the privilege I was given to meet so many good people.' Troufanov’s mother, Yelena, whose husband was murdered by Hamas terrorists on October 7, said, 'I feel like I have received my life, my soul, my heart back' with her son’s return, calling it a 'miracle' that although he’d been shot in both legs when he was abducted, he could stand and walk. Avital Dekel-Chen, wife of Sagui who was freed along with Troufanov, told the gathered journalists that her husband 'did not see daylight since October 7,' and didn’t know what had happened to his family until the day before he was released. He managed to hold on and not give up hope, she said, 'thanks to love.' But it was extremely hard to survive for nearly 17 months, she said, relaying that he had told her, 'It's nice that they write 498 days, but basically it's more correct to say that we've been there for over 43 million seconds of hell.' 'They don't count days or hours, they count seconds,' she emphasized. All the family members who spoke said it was of the utmost importance for all the rest of the hostages to be freed, no matter the cost. Hamas is still holding 73 captives, 35 of whom are known to be dead. Three of them have been held in Gaza for a decade or more: Two mentally ill young men, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who wandered into the Strip in 2014 and 2015 respectively, and Hadar Goldin, a soldier killed in 2014’s Operation Protective Edge, whose body was stolen. The two who are alive are on the list to be freed in the last part of Phase 1 of the current hostage deal.

Israel hits Hezbollah rocket launchers, weapons in Lebanon	Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri announced on Thursday that Beirut rejects Israel’s plan to maintain a presence in five locations in Southern Lebanon after this Tuesday’s ceasefire expiration date (Feb. 18). By JNS The Israeli Air Force on Sunday evening carried out strikes on multiple Hezbollah sites in Lebanon housing rocket launchers and weapons, according to the Israeli military. The Israel Defense Forces emphasized that the presence of terrorist infrastructure at these locations violated agreements between Jerusalem and Beirut, and stated that Israel remains committed to neutralizing any threats to its security. An IAF strike in Southern Lebanon on Saturday night killed Hezbollah operative Abbas Ahmad Hamoud, who was responsible for overseeing the Iranian-backed terror group’s aerial force.

Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri announced on Thursday that Beirut rejects Israel’s plan to maintain a presence in five locations in Southern Lebanon after this Tuesday’s ceasefire expiration date (Feb. 18). According to Berri, the United States, acting as a mediator, informed him that Israel would withdraw from certain villages but intended to remain in five strategic points. Berri, an ally of Hezbollah, stated that he had conveyed Lebanon’s complete rejection of this proposal on behalf of Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. Under the ceasefire agreement, Israeli forces are to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon as the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) assume responsibility for ensuring Hezbollah remains disarmed south of the Litani River. However, there has been growing concern in Jerusalem regarding the LAF’s ability to effectively curb Hezbollah’s presence. In response, the IDF continues frequent border operations to prevent the group from regaining strength, including intelligence gathering, reconnaissance and clearing terrain to disrupt terrorist movements. The ceasefire, which took effect on Nov. 27, mandated an Israeli withdrawal within 60 days. However, the U.S.-monitored arrangement between Lebanon and Israel is set to continue until Feb. 18, according to a White House statement on Jan. 26.

Report: UNRWA illegally operational in Jerusalem	On Oct. 28, the Knesset passed, by large majorities, two laws banning UNRWA following the exposure of UNRWA staff complicity in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, and despite pressure from the United States under former president Joe Biden. By JNS The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains operational in eastern Jerusalem despite its outlawing there and throughout Israel last month, an Israeli radio station reported on Sunday. Senior UNRWA staff have left Israel and Judea and Samaria because the outlawing of the agency risked compromising their freedom of movement, Kan 11 reported. The organization’s two headquarters in Jerusalem have also closed down. But schools and other UNRWA facilities in eastern Jerusalem and beyond remain open and operational, according to the report. Laws that ban UNRWA in Israel went into effect on Jan. 30, making it illegal for UNRWA to maintain a presence or activities in Israel and prohibiting Israeli officials from engaging in contact with the agency. 'This is inconceivable,' Shai Glick, CEO of the right-wing human rights group b’Tsalmo wrote on X. 'We will physically come there and close the place down no matter what happens! We will not allow terrorism free range in Jerusalem,' he added. On Oct. 28, the Knesset passed, by large majorities, two laws banning UNRWA following the exposure of UNRWA staff complicity in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, and despite pressure from the United States under former president Joe Biden. The language of the ban was by far the most robust ever used by Israel against the agency, whose largest donors have been the United States and the European Union. UNRWA has for decades been accused of providing cover and income to Palestinian terrorists while undermining peace efforts, including via its schools’ curriculum. According to Israel, hundreds of UNRWA workers have engaged in terrorism in recent years, including the killers of Yonatan Samerano, an Israeli soldier slain on Oct. 7, 2023, whose body was taken to Gaza. Israel identified one of his kidnappers as UNRWA social worker Faisal Ali Mussalem al Naami. On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump temporarily suspended U.S. foreign aid to UNRWA, pending reviews of existing development programs. UNRWA caters to several millions of people it defines as refugees in Judea and Samaria, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Through UNRWA, the United Nations employs a unique refugee definition for Palestinians. UNRWA defines as refugees not only those who fled the war in 1948 but their descendants in perpetuity until a 'just solution' emerges for their status. The United Nations has a different definition for all other refugees, who cannot give the title to their descendants and often lose it when they are naturalized elsewhere. Critics of the UNRWA definition argue that it’s designed to perpetuate the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

Netanyahu rules out alternatives to Trump’s Gaza plan	Trump has presented 'the only plan that can work,' says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, emphasizing desire of Palestinian Arabs to leave the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lobbied on behalf of President Donald Trump's Gaza resettlement plan on Sunday, urging American Jewish leaders to back the proposal to find new homes for the roughly two million Gazans currently living in the coastal enclave. On Sunday evening, Netanyahu addressed the Conference of Major American Jewish Organizations, lauding President Trump's policies vis-a-vis Israel, while touting Israel's accomplishments in the 15-month war on Hamas. Working with the Trump administration, Netanyahu vowed to 'change' the Middle East, continuing the transformation begun after October 7th. 'Within a year and some months, the courage of our soldiers, the stalwart position of our people and the decisions that we made turned things around. We decimated much of Hamas,' Netanyahu said. 'We haven't finished the job, we will. Israel will destroy Hamas' military and governing capabilities; Gaza will look differently.' 'We changed the Middle East,' Netanyahu continued. 'Now comes President Trump, and Secretary Rubio, who's a great friend of Israel as well. I've seen him over the years, and we had a great discussion today. And we talked about how do we complete the change in the Middle East.' 'We have the greatest friend of Israel in the White House now. We have, we see eye to eye on the main tasks that we have to accomplish, and we're in a position to change the Middle East and give Israel the kind of horizon, the kind of hope, the kind of security and the kind of peace that would have been unimaginable, and in fact was unimaginable from the day of the founding of the State of Israel.' The Israeli premier said Israel is on the cusp of 'victories' greater than any before in its history, including the Six Day War. 'We intend to pursue them to the full.' Trump's proposal to resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip in third-party countries, Netanyahu said, is a 'bold new vision and the only plan that I think can work.' Defending Trump's plan from accusations of ethnic cleansing, Netanyahu argued that most Gazans want to leave the Gaza Strip. 'Why not give Gazans a choice? Everybody said this is the largest open-air prison in the world. Not because of us. We let people leave.' 'In fact, if you want to know, over the last couple of years, two years I think, 150,000 Gazans left. You know how they left? Because they bribed their way out, not through us. They bribed their way out.' 'The rich could leave, but if other people wanted to leave, give them a choice, not forcible eviction, not ethnic cleansing. In a war zone people leave.' 'We tried to get the population to leave, to get them out of harm's way, and Hamas, with rifles, with gunfire, tried to prevent them from leaving. So we moved them around so that they would get out of harm's way. But if people want to leave, if they want to emigrate, it's their choice. And I think President Trump's plan is right on the dot.'

Trump to Netanyahu: ‘Do whatever you want’ in Gaza	After Hamas flouts his ultimatum, releasing just three hostages over the weekend, President Trump says Israel has discretion how to respond. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump gave Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a green light to take whatever course of action Israel deems necessary against the Hamas terror organization, after Hamas ignored Trump's ultimatum last week. Speaking at the Daytona 500 on Sunday, the president noted that while Hamas had not released all the remaining hostages on Saturday as he had demanded last week, three hostages - including a dual Israeli-American citizen - were returned to Israel. 'Now, the reason I made that statement was because [Hamas] said they weren't going to deliver, they were not going to deliver the people that they said they were going to deliver, that they agreed to deliver,' Trump explained. 'When I made the statement, they delivered everybody plus an American.' 'Now, the good news is they look like they're in pretty good shape because the people from the week before didn't look like they were in good shape. They looked like Holocaust survivors, frankly. Horrible. Whatever happened to them was horrible.' Last week, after Hamas threatened to delay the release of hostages slated for return to Israel on Saturday, Trump warned that 'all hell is going to break out' if Hamas does not free all remaining hostages by noon on Saturday. Netanyahu threatened to resume the war in the Gaza Strip if Hamas did not release Israeli hostages, but did not specify how many Israel would need to avert a return to the war. In his statement on Sunday, Trump said it would be 'up to Israel' to respond to the limited hostage release, adding that Netanyahu can 'do whatever you want' with regards to the war in Gaza. 'That will be up to Israel, what the next step is - in consultation with me,' Trump said. 'I told Bibi, you do whatever you want because, you know, my statement was they've got to come back.'

‘We won’t fight for surrender deals’ – IDF soldiers slam Gaza tru...	There is no moral justification for sending us to risk our lives on land that will later be handed over to the enemy,' wrote the soldiers. By World Israel News Staff A group of Israeli soldiers blasted the current ceasefire in Gaza, writing in an open letter to IDF leadership that they were demotivated by the decision to pause the fight against the Hamas terror group. The soldiers, reservists from the Northern Command's Carmeli Brigade, which was stationed in Gaza for a significant part of the Israel-Hamas war, wrote of their frustration with the decision to strike a deal with Hams. 'We do not want to be cannon fodder for deals of surrender,' the soldiers wrote, referring to the current ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement, according to a copy of the letter obtained by KAN News. The soldiers also stressed the importance of seizing land from Hamas, including the creation of a permanent buffer zone in Gaza, in order to protect Israeli civilians. 'How can we have the motivation to return, fight, and risk our lives in operational activities on land that will be handed back to our enemy in a few days? We're not ready to go home, either disabled [from battle wounds] or in coffins, when all our efforts will only serve as leverage for deals to release terrorists,' they added. The soldiers said they were proud to go into battle with the mission of securing a decisive victory over Hamas, but warned that they would be far less willing to put their lives on the line if their efforts would only lead to further prisoner exchanges and concessions towards the terror group. 'We are ready to stand and risk our lives again and again if we know for certain that the purpose of our stand is to fight, defeat, and vanquish the enemy,' they wrote. But, they emphasized, 'there is no moral justification for sending us to risk our lives on land that will later be handed over to the enemy.'

Day 500 of the war: IDF casualties by the numbers	Since October 7th, 2023, 894 members of the security forces, including soldiers, police officers, and members of intelligence agencies, have been killed in combat. By World Israel News Staff Thousands of Israeli security personnel are grappling with physical and mental injuries sustained in the ongoing war, according to a new report from Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv. The report, which leveraged data obtained from the Israeli army and the Defense Ministry’s Rehabilitation Department, revealed the staggering toll of the fighting, which began with Hamas' October 7th, 2023, terror onslaught. Since that day, 894 members of the security forces, including soldiers, police officers, and members of intelligence agencies, have been killed in combat. Approximately 15,000 have been wounded, with that number including both those physically injured and suffering from debilitating mental issues. According to the report, some 8,600 were wounded physically, and 7,600 are facing psychological challenges, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. The statistics indicated that there is a significant number of security forces who sustained both physical and mental injuries simultaneously. Notably, 66 percent of those wounded in combat are reserve soldiers, compared to 17 percent being combat soldiers performing their mandatory service. 10 percent of those wounded were police officers, many of whom sprang into action on October 7th with little training or arms relevant for the scale of the battles. Half of those wounded were between the ages of 18 to 29, with an additional 30 percent aged between 30 to 39. The remaining 20 percent of casualties were age 40 and older. A recent report from the State Comptroller warned that Israel must do more to support traumatized soldiers and civilians, who are also facing mental health challenges after some 15 months of war. The government 'has not done enough to address the anticipated mental health challenges,' the report states, adding that 'no fewer than 3 million Israelis may develop symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD as a result of the war.'

Teacher tells students: Blame Netanyahu for hostage deal issues	Civics teacher says that Netanyahu, not Hamas, is at fault for missed opportunities to secure a hostage deal. By World Israel News Staff The Education Ministry has opened an investigation into a high school teacher who told her students that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, not Hamas, is at fault for the challenges around the completion of the current ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. In a recording made by a student in the classroom, which was leaked to Channel 14 News, the civics teacher from the central city of Ra'anana - whose name has not been publicly revealed - is heard telling students that they are mistaken if they believe Netanyahu is prioritizing freeing the hostages. When a student said that Netanyahu is attempting to bring back the hostages, the teacher is heard saying, 'Is he really trying?' After the student pushed back and said that the premier is trying to secure the captives' freedom, the teacher replied that 'according to everything we know, he's not trying.' The teacher added that 'as of right now, there was no deal that [Netanyahu] didn't blow up.' Numerous students responded by telling the teacher that it was Hamas, not Netanyahu, who had sabotaged opportunities for a deal. 'You all really believe that it was Hamas?' the teacher is heard asking incredulously, implying that they were naive for believing that the terror group is less trustworthy than the prime minister. In additional recordings, the teacher can be heard falsely claiming that Communications Minister Shloma Karai had called for the murder of Attorney Gali Baharav Miara. While Karai has been critical of Barharav Miara, he has never called for her killing. 'As stated, this is an extremely serious incident. Injecting political propaganda and fostering social divisions in the classroom directly contradicts the ministry's values, procedures, and the minister's directives,' the Education Ministry said in a media statement. 'It is important to note that the teacher denies the allegations, and we have not yet received the recordings documenting the incident. The matter will be thoroughly investigated and addressed significantly, based on the findings.' Several hours later, Education Minister Yoav Kisch made an additional comment to Channel 14 News after listening to the recordings. 'I was shocked by the teacher's remarks,' Kisch said, promising the outlet that his ministry is handling the incident with the utmost seriousness. 'The days of spreading hatred and division under the auspices of the education system are over,' he added.

Trump gives Iran a deadline to close its nuclear program	The United States is actively seeking direct and confidential negotiations with Iran, according to the same diplomatic source. By JBN The clock is ticking for Iran to shut down its nuclear program. 'The Trump administration is trying to reach an agreement with Iran before October. However, if this agreement is not achieved, the region will face a serious crisis,' a European diplomat tells Dubai based Al-Hadath. But behind the scenes, American officials are pushing for a diplomatic solution. The United States is actively seeking direct and confidential negotiations with Iran, according to the same diplomatic source. 'Maybe they are trying to get new defense as we speak but their defense is largely gone… Iran is very nervous. I think they’re scared. I would love to make a deal with them without bombing them,' Trump stated during a recent Fox News appearance. 'Everybody thinks Israel with our help or our approval will go in and bomb the hell out of them,' he said. 'I would prefer that not happen. I’d much rather see a deal with Iran where we can do a deal, supervise, check it, inspect it.' Despite dismissing rumors of joint military action with Israel, Trump is tightening the economic screws. On February 4, he signed an executive order reviving his 'maximum pressure policy' aimed at strangling Iran’s oil exports. Once bolstered by sophisticated Russian air defense systems, Iran now finds itself exposed after Israeli strikes last October reportedly destroyed its remaining S-300 missile installations. Tehran has categorically denied any such reports. 'The reality is that in war, clashes happen. But the idea that our defense system has weakened or, as some ignorant individuals say, has been destroyed, is absolutely false,' said Brigadier General Mahdi Farahi as quoted by Iran International. 'Our defense system, in terms of deployment, diversity, and capabilities, has not only not weakened but has become even stronger since before the Zionist regime’s aggression.' Meanwhile, Iran’s nuclear ambitions are becoming an increasingly open topic of discussion within the country. The shift became apparent in late October 2024 after the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ newspaper made waves by calling for Iran to rethink its nuclear strategy, citing Israel’s use of 'devastating military technology to establish a new order.' The debate spread quickly. A week later, 39 members of parliament sent a letter to the Supreme National Security Council pushing for the same reassessment.

Doctors give Netanyahu a clean bill of health in spite of recent ...	His medical team stressed that there is no indication of prostate cancer and that the tissue removed during the recent surgery in December was benign. By Pesach Benson, TPS A recently published document has provided details on the medical condition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, following a year of multiple medical procedures. The document marks the first full medical report on the 75-year-old Prime Minister’s health since 2016. The document, which outlines Netanyahu’s medical history and current condition, is not an official government health report but rather a summary compiled by his personal medical team. According to the report signed by the Prime Minister’s private physician, Dr. Zvi Berkowitz along with Prof. Alon Pikarsky and Prof. Ehud Grossman, Netanyahu is in good health. His blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels are within normal ranges, and comprehensive laboratory tests, including kidney and liver function assessments, showed no abnormalities. The report confirmed that Netanyahu has been undergoing routine colonoscopy screenings, with the latest results indicating no abnormalities. His medical team stressed that there is no indication of prostate cancer and that the tissue removed during the recent surgery in December was benign. The procedure led to a two-week pause in Netanyahu’s corruption trial. Despite the ongoing urinary infection, his doctors assert that his overall health remains stable and that he is receiving appropriate treatment. The medical report noted that Netanyahu underwent a pacemaker implantation in July 2023 due to a conduction block. According to Prof. Roy Beinert, director of the Institute for Arrhythmias at Sheba Medical Center, Netanyahu has not shown signs of heart rhythm disturbances since the procedure and is not dependent on the pacemaker. Regular cardiological evaluations have determined that the device is functioning properly and that Netanyahu is stable from a cardiac standpoint, requiring only routine monitoring. In April 2024, Netanyahu underwent surgery to repair a right inguinal hernia. Prior to the procedure, a full-body CT scan revealed an enlarged prostate, small stones in the bladder, and an obstructive bladder disorder. Subsequently, on December 29, 2024, he underwent laser surgery to remove benign prostate tissue. His doctors noted that the surgery went as expected, though he has been dealing with a persistent urinary tract infection since the procedure. He remains on antibiotic treatment, and his doctors have recommended a gradual return to full activity. Following the prostate surgery, Netanyahu made headlines when he left the Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center over the objections of his doctors to personally cast his vote over the 'Trapped Profits Law.' It passed by a vote of 59-58. Netanyahu was accompanied by Berkowitz in the Knesset plenum. Itamar Ben-Gvir subsequently apologized to Netanyahu and MK Boaz Bismuth, who was forced to interrupt a week of mourning for his mother to cast his vote. Failure to pass the bill could have jeopardized approval of the state budget later, or potentially create a 10-billion-shekel deficit ($2.74 billion).

Arab Countries announce 5 year Gaza reconstruction plan without H...	The plan provides for reconstruction over three to five years, without the displacement of the Palestinian population and without Hamas control. The Algemeiner and i24 News Arab countries will unveil their plan for the reconstruction of Gaza on February 27 in Cairo. This initiative, developed by the Palestinians and handed over to the Egyptians for implementation, will be presented to the leaders of Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. The plan provides for reconstruction over three to five years, without the displacement of the Palestinian population and without Hamas control. The funding, estimated at several hundred million dollars, will come from Gulf countries. The work will be carried out by Egyptian companies, representing a significant source of income for Egypt, which is strongly opposed to any migration of Palestinians out of Gaza. The workforce will consist mainly of local Palestinians. 'The goal is to marginalize Hamas so that it understands that it has lost control of Gaza, and to completely eliminate the terrorist organization’s grip on the population and the territory within 5 years from the start of reconstruction,' a source involved in the plan said. An independent 'Palestinian administration,' separate from the Palestinian Authority but relying on it, will oversee the reconstruction. This power structure is designed to get the approval of Israel and the United States, who refuse direct management by the Palestinian Authority. Arab countries fear a resurgence of fighting by Israel, which could, in their view, favor US President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians to neighboring countries. The former US president said he wanted to see Jordan, Egypt, and other Arab countries welcome more displaced people from Gaza, so that the war-torn area can be 'cleaned up.' According to analyzed satellite images, approximately 65% of the buildings in Gaza have been destroyed during the war. Experts estimate that reconstruction could take more than a decade and cost several hundred billion dollars.

Vance lambasted European leaders on Friday, accusing them of censoring free speech and criticizing German mainstream parties’ 'firewall' against the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). By Reuters and Algemeiner Staff German Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a strong rebuke on Saturday to US Vice President JD Vance’s attack on Europe’s stance toward hate speech and the far right, saying it was not right for others to tell Germany and Europe what to do. Vance lambasted European leaders on Friday, the first day of the Munich Security Conference, accusing them of censoring free speech and criticizing German mainstream parties’ 'firewall' against the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). 'That is not appropriate, especially not among friends and allies. We firmly reject that,' Scholz told the conference on Saturday, adding there were 'good reasons' not to work with the AfD. The anti-immigration party, currently polling at around 20% ahead of Germany’s February 23 national election, has pariah status among other major German parties in a country with a taboo about ultranationalist politics because of its Nazi past. 'Never again fascism, never again racism, never again aggressive war. That is why an overwhelming majority in our country opposes anyone who glorifies or justifies criminal National Socialism,' Scholz said, referring to the ideology of Adolf Hitler’s 1933-45 Nazi regime. Vance met on Friday with the leader of AfD, after endorsing the party as a political partner — a stance Berlin dismissed as unwelcome election interference. Referring more broadly to Vance’s criticism of Europe’s curtailing of hate speech, which he has likened to censorship, Scholz said: 'Today’s democracies in Germany and Europe are founded on the historic awareness and realization that democracies can be destroyed by radical anti-democrats. 'And this is why we’ve created institutions that ensure that our democracies can defend themselves against their enemies, and rules that do not restrict or limit our freedom but protect it.' French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot added his voice to the defense of Europe’s stance on hate speech. 'No one is required to adopt our model but no one can impose theirs on us,' Barrot said on X from Munich. 'Freedom of speech is guaranteed in Europe.' UKRAINE The prospect of talks to end the Ukraine-Russia war had been expected to dominate the annual Munich conference after a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, but Vance barely mentioned Russia or Ukraine in his speech to the gathering on Friday. Instead, he said the threat to Europe that worried him most was not Russia or China but what he called a retreat from fundamental values of protecting free speech – as well as immigration, which he said was 'out of control' in Europe. Many conference delegates watched Vance’s speech in stunned silence. There was little applause as he delivered his remarks. Asked by the panel moderator if he thought there was anything in Vance’s speech worth reflecting on, Scholz drew laughter and applause in the crowd when he responded, in a deadpan manner: 'You mean all these very relevant discussions about Ukraine and security in Europe?'

Israel’s UN Ambassador Leiter says Egypt’s military buildup will ...	Egypt has constructed military bases in Sinai 'that can only be used for offensive operations, for offensive weapons—that’s a clear violation,' said Leiter. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter has accused Egypt of 'very serious' violations of its 45-year-old peace treaty with the Jewish state, saying the government in Jerusalem would table Cairo’s military buildup in Sinai 'very soon.' Egypt has constructed military bases in Sinai 'that can only be used for offensive operations, for offensive weapons—that’s a clear violation,' Leiter said in his first meeting with American Jewish organizations on Jan. 28, a recording of which was shared online by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations on Friday. Egypt’s breach 'is an issue that is going to come to the fore because it’s not tolerable,' the Israeli diplomatic envoy explained. 'For a long time, it’s been shunted aside, and this continues. This is going to be an issue that we’re going to put on the table very soon and very emphatically.' Satellite images indicating changes in Egyptian army deployment in the Sinai Peninsula have reportedly led security coordinators in Israeli border towns to paint a worrying picture of recent developments. IDF Lt. Col. (res.) Eliyahu Dekel, who has monitored Cairo’s adherence to the peace deal since it was signed in 1979, told Israel Hayom last week that 'if the latest images are verified, the concern isn’t just about forces in Sinai, the key issue is the type of tanks. The images show Abrams tanks, which are Egypt’s premier battle tanks, reserved for elite units. 'The question arises: What are these special forces doing in Sinai? In recent years, three new airfields have been built in Sinai, and massive tunnels have been dug, blatantly violating the peace treaty. The treaty allows for military camps for 47 battalions; currently, there are camps for 180 battalions, four times the permitted amount.' In recent days, Cairo’s official rhetoric has escalated in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for relocating Palestinians from Gaza. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has made clear that he will not allow the move to happen, even postponing a planned visit to the White House. In his speech to the Conference of Presidents, Leiter said Sisi 'plays both sides of the equation, but he is threatened by the Muslim Brotherhood.' If the Israeli military decisively defeats the Muslim Brotherhood branch in the Gaza Strip—Hamas—Sisi is 'going to be more open to cooperate with us on the ‘day after’ Hamas,' he argued. The Israeli envoy called it 'unconscionable that Egypt wouldn’t entertain the possibility of at least temporarily housing some of the [Palestinian] refugees, particularly in light of the fact that members of Sisi’s family are running a travel agency in which they take tens of thousands of dollars from Gazans who want to get out of the area.' On Sunday, Sisi told World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder that the establishment of a Palestinian state in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip is 'the only guarantee' for lasting peace in the Middle East. During the meeting with the Jewish leader in Cairo, Sisi called for the reconstruction of the war-torn Strip 'without displacing its residents from their land,' according to a statement published by his office. According to the readout from the Egyptian presidency, Lauder for his part praised Cairo’s 'wise efforts' to restore stability in the Middle East.

Israel in ‘full cooperation’ with Trump, say Netanyahu, Rubio	Netanyahu: 'We have a shared strategy, which cannot always be detailed to the public—including when the gates of hell will open. And they will open if all our hostages are not returned, every last one of them.' By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is working closely with President Donald Trump, according to a joint statement released on Sunday with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 'Contrary to what is being reported, President Trump and I are working in full cooperation and coordination,' the prime minister told Rubio, according to the statement. 'We have a shared strategy, which cannot always be detailed to the public—including when the gates of hell will open. And they will open if all our hostages are not returned, every last one of them,' it continued. According to a statement from his office on Saturday, Netanyahu will convene the Security Cabinet 'soon' to discuss Jerusalem’s response to Trump’s call for the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza to release all of the hostages it is holding. Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s commitment to securing the release of all hostages, dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities and eliminating the threat from Gaza. For his part, the top American diplomat stressed at a press conference alongside the Israeli premier that the Jewish state has had no stronger ally in the White House than Trump. Rubio emphasized that the hostages must be released and reiterated that Hamas cannot continue as a military or governing force in Gaza, saying that the terrorist group 'must be eliminated.' On Syria, he stressed that replacing one destabilizing force with another is not the solution. With regard to Lebanon, he stated that 'we share the same goal: a strong Lebanese state capable of disarming Hezbollah.' Rubio maintained that the ayatollahs’ regime in Tehran is the source of all the instability in the Middle East, saying that this must be addressed and stressing that Iran must never have nuclear weapons. He praised the Jewish state, saying, 'Founded after a horrifying crime against humanity, Israel stands as a beacon to the world. More nations like Israel in the Middle East would make the world safer,' adding that 'Israel seeks peace but won’t be intimidated by its enemies.' Netanyahu offered Rubio a warm welcome, saying it was 'great to welcome you to Jerusalem as secretary of state,' hailing Trump again as 'the greatest friend Israel has ever had at the White House,' and reflecting on his recent visit to Washington. Netanyahu said that he had had a 'very production discussion' with Rubio in a private meeting at his Jerusalem office before participating in an extended diplomatic exchange with their teams. Netanyahu emphasized that Iran was the No. 1 topic of the conversations. 'Israel and America stand shoulder to shoulder in countering the threat of Iran. We agreed that the ayatollahs must not have nuclear weapons,' said Netanyahu. 'We also agreed that Iran’s aggression in the region has to be rolled back,' adding that over the past 16 months, Israel 'has dealt a mighty blow to Iran’s terror axis. 'Under the strong leadership of President Trump and with your unflinching support, I have no doubt that we can and will finish the job,' he added. He thanked Trump for helping to secure the release of three more hostages on Saturday, after Hamas had earlier said they would not be freed on time. 'I also thanked him for America’s unequivocal backing for Israel’s policy in Gaza in moving forward,' said Netanyahu. Netanyahu also said he and Rubio had discussed Trump’s 'bold plan for Gaza' and how to make it a reality. Turning to Lebanon, Netanyahu called the weekend attacks on UNIFIL forces by Hezbollah supporters in Beirut 'concerning,' saying that Hezbollah must be disarmed and that 'Israel will take necessary measures to enforce the ceasefire and ensure its security.' He praised Trump for reinstating his executive order against the International Criminal Court and sanctioning its officials, saying that he discussed with Rubio countering threats from anti-American and anti-Israel international forums. Netanyahu said that he talked with Rubio 'about working together to formulate a common strategy to deal with the threat of lawfare and neutralize this threat once and for all. 'There are significant challenges and opportunities. By working together, America and Israel will overcome obstacles and capitalize on opportunities. The best is yet to come,' Netanyahu said. Rubio touched down in Israel on Saturday night for his first visit to the Jewish state since being confirmed as America’s top diplomat. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar greeted Rubio on the tarmac at Ben-Gurion International Airport. The two counterparts toured the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem on Sunday. Rubio and Sa’ar in their talks discussed strengthening ties with Abraham Accords countries, relocating embassies to Jerusalem, legal challenges to Israel’s self-defense, combating antisemitism, boosting U.S.-Israel economic relations, and implementing Trump’s 'connectivity' vision. They agreed to maintain open dialogue and plan Sa’ar’s visit to Washington soon. The American diplomat also met with other high-ranking officials, including President Isaac Herzog and opposition leader Yair Lapid. 'It’s an honor to be back as the secretary of state, not even four weeks into the job. I wanted this one to be one of our first visits because of the issues before us, and also because of the friendship and solidarity between our two countries,' Rubio said ahead of the meeting with Herzog. 'On behalf of the [U.S.] president, I can tell you he’s strongly and deeply committed to the goal of every single hostage returning home, every single one, and not resting, not being silent, not forgetting, till all of them our home,' according to Washington’s top diplomat. Herzog said, 'Shalom, our dear friend, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. We are honored to have you in our midst, in our country, you have no idea how much it means to us in these challenging days and times that our nation has gone through and endured since October 7, [2023]. 'We are grateful to President Donald Trump for his friendship and solidarity with the people of Israel and the State of Israel, and we are grateful for his direct involvement in bringing back our hostages,' he added. 'Secretary Rubio’s engagements with senior officials will promote U.S. interests in advancing regional cooperation, stability and peace,' State Department Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a press statement ahead of the visit. 'The trip will center on freeing American and all other hostages from Hamas captivity, advancing to Phase II of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, and countering the destabilizing activities of the Iranian regime and its proxies,' the statement continued. Rubio’s trip follows Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip, after which the coastal area would be turned over to American control for reconstruction. On Thursday, Rubio said in an interview that any plan allowing Hamas to rule Gaza would be unacceptable to Israel and ineffective in resolving the conflict. He added that Trump was willing to take the lead on rebuilding Gaza, as no other viable plans have been proposed. Rubio‘s trip also comes amid Israel’s ceasefire agreement with the Hamas terrorist group and the release of hostages held in the Strip. The truce is 'tenuous' because Hamas is a terrorist organization responsible for violence against civilians, Rubio told journalist Chris Cuomo by phone on NewsNation on Tuesday. The secretary of state on Monday described Hamas as an 'evil' and 'monstrous' organization that must be wiped out. 'This is an evil organization. Hamas is evil. It’s pure evil. These are monsters. These are savages. That’s a group that needs to be eradicated,' he said during an interview on talk radio channel SiriusXM Patriot. Rubio will also travel to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the next three days.

International human rights lawyer: ‘It is absolutely legal for th...	Ostrovsky says those violating international human rights law are the ones insisting Gazan civilians must stay in Gaza. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US President Donald Trump's plan for the US to take control of Gaza and allow its civilians to leave the area during the rebuilding process is 'absolutely legal,' according to international human rights lawyer Arsen Ostrovsky. In fact, Ostrovsky asserts that those violating international human rights law are the ones insisting that Gazan civilians must remain in Gaza. Speaking to ILTV News, he said, 'Einstein's famous quote is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. And for many, many years, including since October 7, the international community has had the same failing strategy with respect to Gaza, a strategy that essentially allows Hamas to remain in power, which we know is simply unacceptable.' Ostrovsky emphasized that Trump's plan would be legal as long as the transfer of civilians was not done by force, which would violate international law. Instead, Ostrovsky says he understands Trump's proposal as creating 'a set of circumstances and conditions to allow Gazans to voluntarily choose to move to better conditions elsewhere.' He added that those who insist that Gazans must stay in the Gaza Strip are, in fact, advocating for an inhumane and unsustainable situation. 'I would actually go one step further and suggest that those who insist the Gazans stay are perhaps the ones violating international law. By doing so, especially while Hamas remains in power, they're essentially forcing Gazans to stay in an active war zone and allowing them to be used as human shields by Hamas,' Ostrovsky said. During a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump unveiled his plan for the US to control Gaza and for the civilian population to relocate to Arab countries. Although the plan was welcomed by Israelis, heads of Arab nations have rejected it. The proposal involves collaborating with Arab states to accept refugees from Gaza while the area is reconstructed, a process that could take up to ten years.

IDF soldiers report that Hamas is planting explosives in the Gaza...	This report follows news from last week that Nukhba terrorists were driving pickup trucks near the buffer zone. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News IDF soldiers stationed in the security zone around Gaza report observing Hamas infrastructure crews working in the area and planting explosives. Israeli journalist Almog Boker interviewed soldiers who said terrorists are taking advantage of their access to the zone to lay explosives intended for Israelis. Upon hearing the report, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, 'The directive to the IDF is clear and unambiguous: Anyone who enters the Gaza buffer zone, whether on foot or in a vehicle, is putting their life at risk – and the IDF must respond accordingly.' 'We have a duty to protect IDF soldiers and the residents of southern Israel from every threat and danger, and we will not compromise on security. We will not return to the pre-October 7th reality,' he continued. This report follows news from last week that Nukhba terrorists were driving pickup trucks near the buffer zone, but the IDF's Southern Command refrained from shooting at them. The decision not to strike was based on the fact that the vehicles were merely approaching the zone, not inside it. In this case, the presence of terrorist vehicles outside the zone did not violate the ceasefire. Israel’s air force conducted an airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip on Sunday morning, despite an ongoing ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization in the coastal enclave. The strike was in response to what appeared to be an immediate threat posed by a group of armed Hamas terrorists spotted approaching an IDF position near the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza, which separates the Gaza Strip from Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. 'An Israel Air Force aircraft struck a group of armed men earlier today as they moved toward an IDF force in the southern Gaza Strip,' the IDF said Sunday morning. 'Several hits were identified.' The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claimed that three people were killed in the strike, with two others injured.

IDF airstrike during ceasefire kills 3 Hamas terrorists	Israeli Air Force bombs group of armed Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip as they approached an IDF army unit, leaving at least three terrorists dead, two injured. By World Israel News Staff Israel's air force carried out an airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip Sunday morning, despite an ongoing ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas terror organization in the coastal enclave. The strike was conducted in response to what was potentially an immediate threat posed by a group of armed Hamas terrorists spotted approaching an IDF position close to the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza which separates the Gaza Strip from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. 'An Israel Air Force aircraft struck a group of armed men earlier today as they moved towards an IDF force in the southern Gaza Strip,' the IDF said Sunday morning. 'Several hits were identified.' The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claimed that three people were killed in the strike, with two more injured, the Palestinian Authority mouthpiece WAFA reported, raising the death toll from two to three. Arabic media outlets in the Gaza Strip claimed that the three men killed were Hamas-affiliated police officers working to secure the flow of humanitarian aid from the Rafah crossing into Gaza. Later on Sunday, an IDF spokesperson announced that the Israeli military had foiled an attempt to smuggle weapons across the Egyptian border. During the incident, the IDF detected a drone aircraft which violated Israeli airspace, crossing over from Egypt in the Paran district. 'The drone aircraft was downed by an IDF force which arrived at the site and located the drone, which was carrying a gun and ammunition,' the IDF spokesperson said. 'The confiscated combat equipment were transferred to security forces for handling.'

Marco Rubio lands in Israel, meets with Netanyahu	US Secretary of State makes his first trip to Israel since taking office, meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as joint efforts to secure second phase of hostage deal continue. By World Israel News Staff United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio landed in Israel late Saturday night, kicking off his first visit to the Jewish state since he took office less than a month ago. Hours after touching down at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, Rubio met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem. Afterwards, the two leaders held a joint press conference, during which Netanyahu lauded Rubio as a 'champion' of Israel-U.S. relations. 'President Trump is the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House,' Netanyahu said. 'Your visit here reflects it in every way. Throughout your career you have been a great friend of Israel and a champion of the U.S.-Israel alliance. I have no doubt that your unwavering support will continue during your tenure as secretary of state.' Netanyahu also cited the Trump administration's 'unequivocal support' for Israel's policies in Gaza 'moving forward,' alluding to President Donald Trump's call to resettle the coastal enclave's population in third-party countries, and Trump's backing of Israel's right to resume fighting with Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli premier said that he and Rubio discussed, among other things 'Trump's bold vision for Gaza,' the situation in Syria following last year's coup which saw the ouster of President Bashar Assad, and the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for Netanyahu and a former Israeli defense chief. 'I am absolutely confident that under President Trump's leadership, together with you, Secretary Rubio, the best days of our alliance are still yet to come.' Secretary of State Rubio reiterated the Trump administration's demand that Hamas release all remaining hostages immediately. 'The hostages need to come home,' said Rubio. 'That must happen. It is not optional.' Rubio also lauded Trump's Gaza plan as a 'bold' alternative to the 'tired ideas of the past.' 'The president has also been very bold in his view of what the future should be for the Gaza Strip. Not the same tired ideas of the past; something bold that, frankly, took courage.'

New DNA research could lead to personalized cancer prevention for...	Using advanced genomic tools, the team discovered that DNA’s environment plays a crucial role in determining how much damage occurs and how well cells can repair it. By Pesach Benson, TPS New research about how smoking damages DNA could open new possibilities for targeted cancer prevention. Israeli and US researchers found that the way DNA is organized and chemically modified influences how cigarette smoke affects it. In a study recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, Nucleic Acids Research, the scientists found that some areas of DNA are more open and active, making them more vulnerable to damage but also more efficient at repairing themselves. Other regions are less capable of repair, allowing mutations to develop and potentially lead to cancer. The researchers from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, led by Prof. Sheera Adar and graduate student Elisheva Heilbrun-Katz — collaborated with Prof. Raluca Gordan from Duke University and the University of Massachusetts — also provides new insights into how smoking-related lung cancer develops. Globally, tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. In 2019, it was responsible for approximately 2.6 million cancer deaths, accounting for about 25% of all cancer fatalities worldwide, according to the American Cancer Society. Around 8,000 Israelis die from illnesses caused by active or passive smoking, including various cancers, heart attacks, strokes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to figures released by the Israeli Health Ministry in January. To examine how DNA structure and chemical modifications affect damage from cigarette smoke and the body’s ability to repair it, the researchers focused on benzo[a]pyrene, a harmful chemical found in cigarette smoke. When processed by the body, it turns into Benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), a substance that binds to DNA and interferes with its normal function. Using advanced genomic tools, the team discovered that DNA’s environment plays a crucial role in determining how much damage occurs and how well cells can repair it. Open and active regions of DNA experience more damage but are also repaired more efficiently. Transcription factors, proteins that regulate gene activity, can either protect DNA from damage or increase its vulnerability. The study also found that the efficiency of DNA repair is a key factor in whether mutations form, regardless of how much damage initially occurs. The research suggests that the body’s ability to fix DNA damage is more important than the extent of the damage itself in determining cancer risk. Understanding that some DNA regions are more vulnerable to smoking-induced mutations could help identify high-risk individuals based on genetic and epigenetic factors. This could lead to personalized smoking cessation programs or targeted monitoring for early cancer detection. Moreover, if certain transcription factors influence DNA repair efficiency, drugs could be developed to enhance repair in vulnerable regions, potentially reducing the mutation burden and slowing cancer progression. The findings could help identify specific genetic or epigenetic markers that indicate a higher risk of lung cancer, allowing for earlier and more precise screening methods. And in the long-term, modifying DNA repair mechanisms through gene therapy or epigenetic drugs might help protect high-risk individuals from accumulating smoking-related mutations.

Israeli soldiers arrest 20 men crossing into Lebanon to visit Tal...	The police stressed that illegally crossing the Lebanese border is punishable by up to four years in prison. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli soldiers arrested a group of around 20 Orthodox men who illegally crossed into Lebanese territory to reach the grave of a prominent Talmudic rabbi that straddles the border, the Israeli Police said on Sunday. According to the police, the Israel Defense Forces arrested the Haredim after they crossed the border. They were trying to reach the grave of Rav Ashi, a key figure in the compilation and writing of the Babylonian Talmud. Rav Ashi, who died around 427 CE, headed the Sura Academy in Babylonia, in what is now southern Iraq. He is credited with beginning the process of editing and organizing the discussions of previous generations of sages, which ultimately became the Babylonian Talmud. His work, continued after his death by later scholars laid the foundation for Jewish law as it is known today. Rav Ashi was laid to rest in the Upper Galilee near the present site of Kibbutz Manara, though some scholars believe his grave is in Iraq. A shrine marking the burial spot is located inside a compound located between IDF and UNIFIL positions. The police stressed that illegally crossing the Lebanese border is punishable by up to four years in prison. In November, 71-year-old Israeli civilian researcher Zeev Erlich was killed along with Sgt. Gur Kehati in a Hezbollah ambush after illegally entering Lebanon hoping to find the burial site of Simon the Zealot, a lesser-known disciple of Jesus. Erlich had entered Lebanon wearing an army uniform, though he was neither on active or reserve duty. Two other soldiers were injured in the ambush. Under the terms of a two-month ceasefire that went into effect on November 27 and has since been extended, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its armed presence from areas of southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. Israeli forces have withdrawn from most of southern Lebanon. Dissatisfied with the Lebanese army’s deployment, Israel is keeping soldiers in five locations with US approval. The 'Blue Line' demarcating the 120 km-long Israeli-Lebanese border was created in 2000 by UN cartographers to verify Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon, which the UN Security Council later certified as complete. The border runs from Rosh HaNikra on the Mediterranean coast to Mount Dov, where the Israeli-Lebanese border converges with Syria.

Israel frees 369 Palestinian terrorists as part of hostage deal	The distribution plan indicated that 334 prisoners were to be taken to Gaza, 24 faced deportation abroad, reportedly to Egypt, 10 were to be transferred to Judea and Samaria and one was to be sent to eastern Jerusalem. By JNS Israel released 369 Palestinian terrorists on Saturday in exchange for three Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The prisoners were freed wearing sweatshirts featuring a Star of David and the phrase 'Never forgive, never forget' in Arabic. Some discarded and burned the clothing.

With two weeks left in the first phase of the truce, a total of 21 hostages and over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners have been released so far. According to the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club, 333 of the released prisoners were from Gaza and were detained after Oct. 7, 2023. The distribution plan indicated that 334 prisoners were to be taken to Gaza, 24 faced deportation abroad, reportedly to Egypt, 10 were to be transferred to Judea and Samaria and one was to be sent to eastern Jerusalem. Thirty-six prisoners serving life sentences were among those released. Among them was Ahmed Barghouti, a close aide of Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti. Ahmed Barghouti was serving 13 life sentences for attacks that killed 12 Israelis during the Second Intifada [2000-2005], including the devastating bombing at Tel Aviv’s Seafood Market restaurant. The release roster also includes Mansour Sharim, a prominent figure in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades in Tulkarem. Serving 14 life sentences, Sharim orchestrated numerous attacks against Israelis during the Second Intifada. His conviction encompasses intentional causing of death and attempted murder charges. According to Israeli Justice Ministry records, he too was facing deportation. Another significant release involves Mansour Mokdeh, a Fatah member imprisoned since 2002. Serving a 30-year sentence for weapons possession and murder, Mokdeh was slated for permanent deportation. Palestinian media sources also indicated the imminent release of Shadi Abu Shahadam, who played a key role in planning and executing the 2002 Mahane Yehuda suicide bombing that claimed six Israeli lives. The attack was carried out by a woman from Hebron. Abu Shahadam, currently serving a life sentence, was facing permanent deportation. His conviction includes multiple charges: making threats, intentional causing of death, membership in an unauthorized organization, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit a crime. He has remained in custody since 2002. The hostages freed in this exchange were American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Argentine-Israeli Iair Horn, 46, and Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, 29. Under the first six-week phase of the ceasefire agreement, a total of 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are set to be released.

Torture, lice-ridden tunnels, salty water – freed hostages speak ...	Sagui Dekel-Chen, Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov and Iair Horn suffered unspeakable conditions in Hamas captivity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Sagui Dekel-Chen, Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov and Iair Horn, the three hostages freed Saturday, have begun revealing the unspeakable conditions in which they were held during 498 days of Hamas captivity, Channel 12 and Kan News reported Sunday. The trio, who were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, were held almost the entire time in tunnels under Khan Yunis, only a few miles away from their point of capture. The underground passages were moldy and infested with lice and bedbugs. The hostages were also given practically no food and only salty water to drink, which only increased their thirst. Hamas suspected some of the men of being IDF soldiers, although all three men were over army age. American-Israeli Dekel-Chen (36) underwent frequent interrogations to reveal intelligence that he did not have, and the results of the torture have left scars on his body, Channel 12 reported. He was also shot in his right shoulder when Hamas forces overran Nir Oz and he went to fight the terrorists while leaving his pregnant wife and two young daughters inside their home’s safe room. Dekel-Chen reported that he was completely cut off from all means of communication over these 16 months and lived with the constant thought that his family had been murdered in the kibbutz. He was only informed that they were alive just before his release, including the fact that his wife had given birth to a third daughter some two months after his capture. Russian-Israeli Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov, 29, was shot in both legs and brutally beaten when captured by the terrorists. Unlike the others, he was held alone his entire time in captivity, and learned to read and write Arabic as a means to keep busy. He was only updated irregularly by his captors as to what was happening in the war but did hear on the radio that his mother and girlfriend, who had been captured along with him but whom he never saw, had been freed in the first deal with Hamas in November 2023. Troufanov’s and Dekel-Chen’s wounds were left untreated the whole time in captivity, and it is likely that they will have to undergo surgery to repair their injuries. Horn (46) lost several dozen kilograms during his time in captivity and did not receive regular medical treatment. He had been kidnapped along with his brother, Eitan (37), who had come to the kibbutz for the Simchat Torah holiday that was being celebrated on October 7. The brothers were at first held together but then were separated, and Horn does not know Eitan’s current condition. The three hostages were exchanged for 369 Palestinian security prisoners, including 36 senior terrorists serving life sentences. While the deal’s parameters were that 30 terrorists would be released for every male civilian, Israel also promised to release 1,000 Palestinians who were detained since the October 7 Hamas-led invasion and did not participate in the day’s massacre of 1,200 people. Some of this cohort are seemingly being freed every week, which is why the number of freed prisoners is so high.

Amazon finally speaks out on employee held hostage in Gaza	For 16 months, the retail giant kept quiet about the Israeli hostage because it said it didn’t want to endanger him. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Amazon headquarters has finally spoken out after its employee, Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov, was released Saturday as part of the first phase of the Israel-Hamas hostage and ceasefire deal. CEO Andy Jassy wrote an email to the international retail giant’s entire workforce, saying, 'I’m incredibly relieved to share the news that our AWS teammate, Sasha Troufanov, who had been held hostage since the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, has been released from captivity.' Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides cloud computing services to its clients, and Troufanov worked for the Annapurna Labs subsidiary in Israel that designed a new chip for the company. When the company held a conference that featured the chip during the week in November 2023 that Israel and Hamas had their first hostage deal, in which Troufanov’s mother, grandmother and girlfriend were released, among others, friends of the captive paid to have trucks with screens bearing Troufanov’s face drive around outside the Las Vegas hall. Amazon itself did not comment on the kidnapping, nor did it condemn Hamas, angering many Jewish employees in various countries, who said that for the first few months they did not even know that their colleague was among those forcibly taken into Gaza. Only the company's Israeli employees were allowed to show Troufanov's picture on their walls and speak about their colleague. In Saturday’s message, Jassy insisted that Amazon had 'had a dedicated team working behind the scenes with experts to support efforts to secure [the Troufanovs’] release and to ensure that we did the right thing for them and their safety.' This included, he added, 'painfully not commenting publicly for fear that we would negatively impact their ability to be released or how they were treated in captivity.' The CEO thanked 'all who tirelessly advocated' for Troufanov’s safe return. One of these was a close friend of the Russian-Israeli engineer, Neta Yesood Alon, who angrily told Globes in May that the company 'had explained to activists and the family that any public activity in Amazon’s name was liable to put Troufanov at risk, and that they didn’t want to turn Sasha into the poster child of the hostages, because that would raise his value.' When Globes contacted Amazon for a comment, it vaguely stated that 'We continue to focus all the time on all the efforts to bring Sasha back home safely,' and said it was 'support[ing] the family at this difficult time.' In the email, Jassy repeated that his company 'will continue to support them and do everything we can to help them heal' now that Troufanov was free. He ended with a general message that his 'heart goes out to everyone impacted by the war' and that he hoped for peace, while still not condemning the terrorists who were the cause of his employee’s horrific ordeal.

IAF kills Hezbollah drone force commander	During the war, Hezbollah’s aerial forces, known as Unit 127, repeatedly fired explosives-laden drones into Israel. By JNS An Israeli Air Force strike in Southern Lebanon on Saturday night killed Hezbollah operative Abbas Ahmad Hamoud, who was responsible for overseeing the Iranian-backed terror group’s aerial force. Hamoud was targeted after repeatedly violating the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire, including by launching UAVs toward Israeli territory, according to the Israel Defense Forces. 'The IDF continues to operate to remove any threat to the State of Israel and will operate to prevent any attempt by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to establish itself, which is contrary to the understandings reached between Israel and Lebanon,' added the statement. During the war, Hezbollah’s aerial forces, known as Unit 127, repeatedly fired explosives-laden drones into Israel. Overnight Thursday, IAF fighter jets attacked Hezbollah targets in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley after the Iranian-backed terrorist organization dispatched a surveillance drone over the Jewish state. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Saturday described the launch of the drones at the Jewish state as 'a red line' and 'a blatant violation' of the ceasefire agreement. 'As I warned, if there are drones, there will be no Hezbollah,' said Katz. Also on Thursday, the IAF carried out targeted strikes on Hezbollah military sites in Southern Lebanon that posed a direct threat to Israel’s security, the IDF said. 'Terrorist activity in these sites is a clear violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,' the military added. The IDF’s 769th 'Hiram' Brigade, operating under the 91st 'Galilee' Division, is continuing to conduct searches in Southern Lebanon as part of operations aligned with the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, the army stated on Thursday. Troops have discovered weapons depots containing missiles, rockets, mortar shells, grenades, explosives and firearms. In forested areas, they also found concealed multi-barrel launchers aimed at Israeli territory. Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri announced on Thursday that Beirut rejects Israel’s plan to maintain a presence in five locations in Southern Lebanon after the ceasefire’s Feb. 18 expiration date. According to Berri, the United States, acting as a mediator, informed him that Israel would withdraw from certain villages but intended to remain in five strategic points. Berri, an ally of Hezbollah, stated that he had conveyed Lebanon’s complete rejection of this proposal on behalf of Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. Under the ceasefire agreement, Israeli forces are to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon as the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) assume responsibility for ensuring Hezbollah remains disarmed south of the Litani River. However, there has been growing concern in Jerusalem regarding the LAF’s ability to effectively curb Hezbollah’s presence. In response, the IDF continues frequent border operations to prevent the group from regaining strength, including intelligence gathering, reconnaissance and clearing terrain to disrupt terrorist movements. The ceasefire, which took effect on Nov. 27, mandated an Israeli withdrawal within 60 days. However, the U.S.-monitored arrangement between Lebanon and Israel is set to continue until Feb. 18, according to a White House statement on Jan. 26.

Lebanon: 25 UNIFIL attackers arrested, will be punished	The incident raised serious questions as to whether Lebanese security forces are capable of reigning in Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Lebanese security forces have arrested 25 people who participated in a recent attack on UN peacekeeping forces, according to an official statement. Last Friday, Hezbollah activists waving the terror group's flags attacked a convoy of UNIFIL soldiers near Beirut International Airport. Footage of the attack circulating on social media showed mobs beating UNIFIL soldiers and setting one of their vehicles on fire. Two UN soldiers were wounded in the attack, including Nepalese national Chok Bahadur Dhaka, who is the outgoing deputy force commander of UNIFIL. Dhaka's injuries were serious enough that he required hospitalization. 'More than 25 people have been arrested by Lebanese army intelligence,' Lebanese Interior Minister Ahmad al-Hajjar told reporters during a media conference on Saturday. However, al-Hajjar noted, 'this does not mean these detainees carried out the attack… but the investigations will show who is responsible.' Lebanese President Joseph Aoun pledged in a statement posted to his X account that 'the attackers will receive their punishment.' Aoun added that 'security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to upset stability and civil peace.' The chaos began with a protest by pro-Hezbollah activists, who were demonstrating against a decision by Lebanese authorities to disallow an Iranian plane from landing. The denial to land occurred after an Israeli warning that Iran was using the airport to smuggle cash to Hezbollah, which would make the transportation hub a potential target for the IDF. Hezbollah activists raged that Lebanon was caving to Israeli and international pressure, and they blocked roads near the airport as an act of protest. UNIFIL was called in to deescalate the situation, but instead, came under attack by Hezbollah activists. The incident raised serious questions as to whether Lebanese security forces are capable of reigning in Hezbollah and its activists. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the violence in a press statement. 'Such attacks are absolutely unacceptable… The safety and security of UN personnel and property must be respected at all times,' Stephane Dujarric, Guterres’s spokesman, said in a media release. 'Attacks against peacekeepers are in breach of international law… and may constitute war crimes,' the statement added. 'UNIFIL must be allowed unrestricted freedom of movement throughout Lebanon.'

After Trump lifts ban, US heavy bombs arrive in Israel	Shipment of MK-84 heavy aerial munitions arrive in Israel over the weekend, after being held up for nearly a year by the Biden administration. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News After close to a year of delays, a shipment of heavy aerial bombs from the United States arrived in Israel over the weekend. Israel's Ministry of Defense announced Sunday morning that a shipment of heavy aerial bombs recently released by the U.S. government was received and unloaded late Saturday night. A shipping vessel carrying an order of 2,000-pound MK-84 munitions docked Saturday night and was unloaded at the Port of Ashdod before dawn Sunday morning. The munitions were loaded onto dozens of trucks from the Transportation Unit of the Ministry’s Logistics and Assets Department and the IDF's Technological and Logistics Directorate and transferred to Israeli Air Force bases. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) said that the arrival of the heavy bombs serves as 'evidence' of the strong ties between Israel and the U.S. Katz also called the aerial munitions a 'significant asset' for the Israeli military. 'The munitions shipment that arrived in Israel tonight, released by the Trump Administration, represents a significant asset for the Air Force and the IDF and serves as further evidence of the strong alliance between Israel and the United States.' 'In our recent conversation, Secretary of Defense, HON Pete Hegseth reaffirmed America's commitment to continue providing Israel with all necessary tools to ensure its security.' 'I thank President Donald Trump and the U.S. Administration for their unwavering support of the State of Israel. We will continue working together to strengthen our security.'​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ The shipment of MK-84 heavy bombs was held up for nearly a year, after the Biden administration suspended the transfer of some aerial munitions to Israel, amid criticism of the IDF's handling of the war in the Gaza Strip and in protest of Israel's plans in early 2024 to carry out a large-scale ground operation in Rafah. Shortly after taking office, President Donald Trump lifted the Biden-era ban, clearing the way for the shipment of MK-84 bombs to be transferred to Israel.

Russian Ambassador meets newly-freed hostage Sasha Trufanov	The Kremlin does not classify Hamas or Islamic Jihad - the group which held Trufanov - as terror organizations. By World Israel News Staff Russian Ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov met with former Islamic Jihad hostage Alexander 'Sasha' Trufanov just hours after his release from captivity, presenting him with a new Russian passport on Saturday. The ambassador 'sincerely welcomed the release of our compatriot,' the Russian Embassy in Israel wrote on its official X account, alongside images of Viktorov meeting with Trufanov at Sheba Hospital. 'Russian diplomats did not stop their efforts to free Alexander Trufanov for a single day,' the embassy added. 'They were in constant contact with the Israeli and all interested parties in the region on this priority issue for us.' The statement noted that advocacy efforts for Trufanov's release were performed 'on the instruction of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin.' Notably, the Kremlin does not classify Hamas or Islamic Jihad - the group which held Trufanov - as terror organizations. Viktorov gave a new Russian passport to Trufanov, which he had previously applied for but 'for obvious reasons, was unable to receive on time.' Trufanov was kidnapped along with his mother, Yelena, grandmother, Irena, and girlfriend Sapir Cohen from his parent's home in Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7th. His father, Vitaly, was murdered by terrorists during the attack. Trufanov's mother and grandmother were released in a November 2023 agreement between the Kremlin and the terror group, which did not require concessions from Russia towards Hamas. Cohen, his girlfriend, was released in an Israeli hostage deal that saw the majority of Israeli female and child captives freed from Gaza. In recent months, Moscow raised concerns around Trufanov's physical health, as he was shot twice during his abduction and was never provided with proper medical care. A Russian government spokesman celebrating Trufanov's release failed to mention that Israel had freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners as part of the deal. 'We thank the Hamas administration for its decision,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.

Hamas captors cynically gave Sagui Dekel-Chen earrings for his wi...	Dekel-Chen did not believe the terrorists about the birth of his daughter until the IDF confirmed it was true. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As a form of psychological torture, Hamas terrorists informed Sagui Dekel-Chen about the birth of his daughter, gave him earrings, and instructed him to give them to his wife. Dekel-Chen did not believe the terrorists about the birth of his daughter until the IDF confirmed it was true. He had been injured in the shoulder but told the soldiers to disregard his wounds, saying, 'What’s most important is meeting my family.' Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, and Sasha Troufanov were released together on Saturday after 498 days in captivity. Horn and Dekel-Chen were held together, while Troufanov was kept in isolation during his captivity. The three were held captive in Khan Younis, just a few hundred meters from where they were abducted at Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7th. Initially, they were confined in tunnels before being moved to apartments. Horn knew that his brother had also been taken hostage, and shortly after his capture, he asked, 'When will they release Eitan?' When the IDF informed Troufanov that his father, Vitaly, had been murdered, he broke down in tears. Although Dekel-Chen, Horn, and Troufanov showed signs of severe weight loss and were weak and pale, they could stand and walk independently. They appeared healthier than the three hostages released the previous week, whose emaciated appearances were compared to Holocaust survivors. Upon their release, the hostages were given small amounts of food, including tea with sugar, applesauce, a few biscuits, and vitamin B1 (thiamine) to prevent refeeding syndrome—a potentially fatal condition that can occur when food is reintroduced too quickly to the body of someone severely malnourished. The hostages had appeared in videos created by Hamas for propaganda purposes and psychological warfare against Israelis. Horn was coerced into mentioning his brother Eitan in one of these videos. Regarding the release of Troufanov, a Russian citizen, Russian press secretary Dmitry Peskov said, 'Moscow praises the release of Alexander Troufanov in Palestine.' Peskov also thanked Hamas for agreeing to release him.

Hamas agrees to relinquish control of Gaza in second phase of hos...	Hamas said it would be prepared to discuss the implementation of Phase Two of the hostage and ceasefire agreement on Monday. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas has reportedly agreed to step down from governing Gaza during the second phase of the ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement. On Thursday, senior official Osama Hamdan told Qatar-based Al Araby TV that Hamas would be prepared to discuss the implementation of Phase Two of the agreement on Monday. Hamdan said the terror group would abide by the agreement; 'If Israel meets its commitments, we will proceed with releasing the hostages as agreed on Saturday or in the coming days.' As part of Phase Two, Hamas agreed it would step away from governing Gaza. The ceasefire agreement seemed to have been at an impasse last Monday when Hamas said it would not return hostages as agreed on Saturday, citing allegations that Israel had violated the agreement. Hamas claimed that Israel was blocking aid and preventing civilians from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. 'Over the past three weeks, the resistance leadership has been observing the enemy's violations and their failure to uphold the terms of the agreement,' Hamas stated. 'The return of displaced people to the northern Gaza Strip is being delayed, while they are being targeted with shelling and gunfire in various parts of Gaza. Additionally, relief supplies of all kinds are being blocked from entering as agreed, even though the resistance has fulfilled all its commitments.' Last Sunday, footage published on social media showed Gazans approaching the border with Israel, violating the ceasefire agreement that requires a 700-meter buffer zone. The video shows Gazan civilians near Kibbutz Nahal Oz, prompting the IDF to fire shots into the crowd. Gazan media reported that three people were killed in the shooting. The IDF stated that it fired warning shots in multiple areas of Gaza. Defense Minister Israel Katz commented on the incident on Sunday night, saying, 'Israel’s security stance on Gaza remains firm: Anyone entering the buffer zone does so at their own risk.' 'There will be no tolerance for those who pose a threat to IDF forces, the border region, or nearby communities. We will not allow a repeat of the events of October 7. 'IDF troops acted appropriately today in identifying and neutralizing the threat, and this approach will continue. The IDF is fully prepared for any scenario and will respond decisively to any danger,' Katz stated. The IDF has cautioned Palestinians against approaching the Israeli border and the buffer zone within Gaza, where its troops are stationed.

369 Palestinian prisoners freed, forced to wear sweatshirts with ...	Of the 369 Palestinian prisoners released Saturday, 36 were serving life sentences for murder. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The 369 Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for three hostages on Saturday were made to wear sweatshirts with a Star of David on the back, alongside the phrase 'We will not forget nor forgive' in Arabic. These prisoners were freed in exchange for Sagui Dekel Chen, Alexander Sasha Troufanov, and Iair Horn, who had been held in Gaza for 498 days. Of the 369 Palestinian prisoners, 36 were serving life sentences for murder. One source criticized Israel's prison service (IPS) to KAN News for making the decision to have the prisoners wear the sweatshirts, pointing out that the political echelon had not been informed, and the action projected a negative image at a time when Israel is condemning Hamas's cynical tactics to cause embarrassment and psychological harm to hostages, such as releasing them with medals, ceremonies, and 'goody bags.' The IPS clarified that the decision was made by IPS Commissioner Kobi Yaakovi, according to KAN. Hamas condemned the shirts, calling the slogans written on them 'racist' and referring to the treatment of prisoners as a violation of humanitarian law, in contrast to the resistance's strong commitment to moral values in the treatment of the enemy's prisoners. Among the prisoners released on Saturday was Ahmed Barghouti, cousin and aide to intifada terrorist Marwan Barghouti, who was directly involved in attacks that killed 12 Israelis. Another released prisoner was Fatah terrorist Mazen al-Qadi, who planned a 2002 attack on a seafood restaurant in Tel Aviv that killed three Israelis. Qadi was also suspected of sexually assaulting five female guards at Ramon Prison in 2023. Mantzur Sharim, serving 14 life sentences plus an additional 50 years, was also released. During the Second Intifada, he attacked a banquet hall in Hadera, killing six Israelis and injuring 26. Sharim also murdered a soldier and a civilian in 2001.

3 released hostages appeared emaciated, pale	Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov, Sagui Dekel Chen, and Iair Horn, appeared emaciated and pale as they returned to Israel after 498 days in captivity. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The three hostages, Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov, Sagui Dekel Chen, and Iair Horn, appeared emaciated and pale as they returned to Israel after 498 days in captivity. However, the three were able to stand and walk unaided, and medical professionals determined they did not require hospitalization at either Soroka Medical Center or Barzilai Medical Center in the South. In addition to being checked by medical staff in Re'im, they were accompanied by mental health officers on their way to both Ichilov Hospital and Sheba Medical Center. The freed hostages were given small amounts of food, including tea with sugar, applesauce, a few biscuits, and vitamin B1 (thiamine) to prevent refeeding syndrome, a potentially fatal condition that can occur when food is introduced too suddenly into the system of someone who is severely malnourished. The three were reunited with their families, underwent medical tests, and were transported by Yasur helicopter for further treatment. Medical professionals are concerned that, in addition to the psychological trauma endured by the former hostages, their near-starvation conditions might have caused permanent damage to their hearts and muscles. The families of the hostages expressed joy and relief at the return of their loved ones. The Troufanov family said in a statement: 'We are filled with overwhelming emotion and gratitude as Sasha returns home after 498 long and agonizing days in captivity. On October 7, he was brutally abducted from his home and shot in both legs. Seeing him today is a powerful source of strength, offering us renewed hope for the challenging rehabilitation ahead. This moment brings immense relief to us, his friends, and to everyone who never gave up hope and prayed for his safe return.'

Iran, facing threats from Trump to roll back nuclear weapons prog...	Iran unveiled two types of ballistic missiles, the Khorramshahr and Hajj Qassem, as well as a satellite carrier dubbed the 'Omid.' By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Iran paraded a cache of highly advanced ballistic missiles across Tehran following a series of threats by President Donald Trump to 'bomb the hell' out of the country if it doesn’t roll back its atomic weapons program. As the hardline regime worked to prove its military might, a senior Iranian militaIran unveiled two types of ballistic missiles, the Khorramshahr and Hajj Qassem, as well as a satellite carrier dubbed the 'Omid.'ry commander dared Trump to strike, saying he 'does not have the courage to attack Iran.' The charged rhetoric signals that Tehran is choosing confrontation with the United States after Trump reimposed his 'maximum pressure' sanctions campaign on the country, which specifically aims to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program and deny it intercontinental ballistic missiles—the same ones used to attack Israel twice last year. At the same time, Trump has expressed a willingness to pursue diplomacy with Iran, saying he favors that approach over conflict. But the military demonstrations across Tehran this week, held to celebrate the 46th anniversary of the regime’s 'Islamic revolution,' indicate the president is facing an uphill battle. 'Trump does not have the courage to attack Iran,' General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Aerospace Force, said on the sidelines of Monday’s military display. 'Iran, as a powerful nation, does not bow to coercion.' Iran unveiled two types of ballistic missiles, the Khorramshahr and Hajj Qassem, as well as a satellite carrier dubbed the 'Omid.' The towering ballistic missiles can travel around 1,800 to 2,000 kilometers, putting them well within reach of not only Israel but U.S. military outposts across the region. The Khorramshahr 'can carry multiple warheads,' while the Hajj Qassem is a 'precision strike missile' that can penetrate enemy air defense systems, much like those Israel used last year to fend off a swarm of Iranian missiles, according to the Iran’s state-controlled media. Other missiles in Tehran’s arsenal are nuclear-capable and based on North Korean technology. Iran emphasized that it can now build much of this equipment on its own, without help from allies like Russia and China. For regional observers, Tehran’s military posturing is part of a bid to restore its image in the wake of Israel’s devastating October strike on the country’s air defense systems and key military installations. 'These highly public shows of force are how the regime hopes to repair its battered deterrence after Israel’s successful military pushback against it in 2024,' said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a nonproliferation expert who analyzes Iran’s weapons program for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. As part of this image rehabilitation, Tehran ran additional air defense drills this week and revealed a 'new solid-propellant medium range ballistic missile,' according to Ben Taleblu, who said he expects Iran to continue testing Trump in the coming months. 'While Trump’s new presidential memorandum will be a bright green light to enforce maximum pressure sanctions which long atrophied under Biden, Iran in the short term will continue to ramp up its nuclear capable missile threat,' he said. During a Wednesday public appearance, Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei praised the country’s military establishment for making advances on ballistic missiles and other weapons technology. 'Iran's defense power is known to everyone today,' he said. 'While the friends of the revolution are proud of it and the enemies are afraid of it.' Khamenei’s remarks came after he toured a military facility producing a series of new 'kamikaze' drones, which appear similar to those used by Hezbollah during its siege on Israel’s northern border. Amid this flurry of military activity, Iranian diplomats on Tuesday filed a formal complaint with the United Nations Security Council over Trump’s repeated threats to bomb the country if a diplomatic deal cannot be reached. 'I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear,' Trump told the New York Post on Saturday. 'I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it.' The president made similar remarks a day later on Fox News. Iran’s ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, complained that Trump’s 'reckless and inflammatory statements flagrantly violate international and the U.N. charter.' 'The Islamic Republic of Iran firmly rejects and condemns this reckless threat,' Iravani said before the international body. 'The U.N. Security Council must not remain silent in the face of such brazen rhetoric, as normalizing the threat to use force sets a dangerous precedent and must be unequivocally condemned.'

As Kennedy takes over the Department of Health and Human Services, he faces significant challenges, including shaping vaccine policy, managing Medicare and Medicaid, and preparing for future public health crises. By Jewish Breaking News Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in a 52-48 Senate vote, overcoming strong opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans. His confirmation follows a dramatic political evolution, from being a staunch Trump critic to becoming a key figure in the administration. Kennedy, a longtime environmental lawyer and vaccine skeptic, once harshly criticized President Donald Trump, even comparing him to Adolf Hitler. However, during the 2024 election, Kennedy initially launched a Democratic presidential bid before switching to an independent campaign. As his poll numbers declined and financial struggles mounted, he suspended his campaign in August 2024 and endorsed Trump, citing alignment on key issues such as government health mandates and regulatory overreach. Robert Kennedy walks out during a Trump rally. (Twitter Screenshot) Trump rewarded Kennedy’s endorsement by nominating him for HHS Secretary in November 2024, a move that stunned both parties. While conservatives saw it as an unconventional choice, Kennedy’s history of opposing vaccine mandates and public health restrictions resonated with many in Trump’s base. Kennedy’s confirmation process was fiercely contested. Democrats unanimously opposed him due to his decades-long promotion of vaccine conspiracy theories, while some Republicans were wary of his past support for abortion rights and environmental regulations. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor and staunch vaccine advocate, was the only Republican to vote against Kennedy. Leading up to the vote, Senate Democrats staged an all-night protest, warning that Kennedy’s appointment could undermine public health initiatives. However, despite their efforts, Kennedy secured the necessary votes on Thursday morning. As Kennedy takes over the Department of Health and Human Services, he faces significant challenges, including shaping vaccine policy, managing Medicare and Medicaid, and preparing for future public health crises. His critics worry that his leadership could erode trust in scientific institutions, while his supporters argue he will bring much-needed reform to federal health agencies. Kennedy’s appointment marks a major shift in the Trump administration’s approach to public health, setting the stage for contentious policy battles in the months ahead. Whether he moderates his stance or doubles down on his past positions remains to be seen. The post Robert F.

Trump had warned that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed on Gaza if Hamas did not release all the hostages by the 12:00 deadline. By World Israel News and JNS Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump for his leadership and strong stance, which contributed to the hostages' release on Saturday morning, according to a statement issued on Saturday night. 'The combination of the reinforcement of IDF forces around the Gaza Strip and President Trump's firm stance led to the release of three of our hostages today - despite Hamas's earlier refusal to release them,' the statement read. 'The Prime Minister also appreciates the President's full support for Israel's decisions regarding the Gaza Strip going forward.' The U.S. president congratulated the freed hostages, but made clear that their release fell short of his call to free all the captives. 'Hamas has just released three Hostages from GAZA, including an American Citizen. They seem to be in good shape! This differs from their statement last week that they would not release any Hostages,' Trump said on Saturday on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Israel will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O’CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES. The United States will back the decision they make!' he added, seemingly referring to U.S. Eastern Time, which is 7 p.m. in Israel. The president’s deadline was a reference to his previous warning that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed on Gaza if Hamas did not release all the hostages. Seventy-three hostages remain inside the Strip, including 70 kidnapped on Oct. 7. Saturday’s exchange of hostages for terrorists was the sixth such round under Phase 1 of the ceasefire that took effect on Jan. 19 and is to end on March 1. The three latest returnees from Hamas captivity in Gaza reunited on Saturday with their families in heartfelt scenes of elation and relief. American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, met with his wife, Avital, and his parents at the IDF’s Re’im camp just outside the Strip before being flown by helicopter to Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer in Ramat Gan. שגיא דקל-חן במפגש הראשון המרגש עם אשתו אביטל והוריו נעומית ויונתן, בנקודת הקליטה הראשונית בישראל. צילומים: דובר צה'ל pic.twitter.com/OWSVIQZeuF &mdash; ראש ממשלת ישראל (@IsraeliPM_heb) February 15, 2025 During the reunion, Avital informed him of their third daughter’s name. She was seven-months’ pregnant when Dekel-Chen was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023. 'Do you remember what you called her? That’s her name, Shahar-Mazal,' she said. 'Perfect,' Dekel-Chen replied. 'You are heroes, you protected me,' Dekel-Chen told his spouse and mother.

In the coming hours, he will begin the recovery process, reunite with his daughters, Gali and Bar, and meet his youngest daughter, Shachar, for the first time—she was born while he was in captivity. 'Our hearts ache for all that he missed, but now he is here, unlike so many others,' the statement read. 'There are still many families waiting for their loved ones, many children waiting for their fathers. We will continue to fight until the last hostage is brought home. This is our duty.'

You will forever be in our hearts.' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi visited the military’s Hostages and Missing Persons Command Center to oversee the men’s release and stated, 'Alongside the immense emotion with the return of each hostage, we in the IDF remember our obligation to bring them all back. We are investing great efforts toward this goal, while simultaneously preparing offensive plans.' The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that Israel is 'fully prepared for the next steps in every respect,' referring to the fragile truce with Hamas and its potential collapse. The PMO welcomed the three men 'with a warm embrace. We have prepared for their return, and together with their families, we will assist in their recovery after the long and harrowing days in captivity.' The statement continued that Hamas again 'attempted to violate the agreement and fabricate a crisis with false claims. Thanks to the concentration of our forces inside and around Gaza, and due to President [Donald] Trump’s clear and unequivocal statement, Hamas backed down, and the hostage releases continued.

The Horn family stated, 'We can finally breathe a little. Our Yair is home after surviving hell and terror in Gaza. Now, we just need to bring Eitan back so our family can truly breathe again. We are grateful to the IDF soldiers and security forces who risk their lives and bodies, and we send our condolences to the bereaved families who have lost their most precious loved ones for all of us. You will forever be in our hearts.' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi visited the military’s Hostages and Missing Persons Command Center to oversee the men’s release and stated, 'Alongside the immense emotion with the return of each hostage, we in the IDF remember our obligation to bring them all back. We are investing great efforts toward this goal, while simultaneously preparing offensive plans.' The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that Israel is 'fully prepared for the next steps in every respect,' referring to the fragile truce with Hamas and its potential collapse. The PMO welcomed the three men 'with a warm embrace. We have prepared for their return, and together with their families, we will assist in their recovery after the long and harrowing days in captivity.' The statement continued that Hamas again 'attempted to violate the agreement and fabricate a crisis with false claims. Thanks to the concentration of our forces inside and around Gaza, and due to President [Donald] Trump’s clear and unequivocal statement, Hamas backed down, and the hostage releases continued. We are working in full coordination with the United States to secure the release of all our hostages—both the living and the fallen—as quickly as possible.' The U.S. president congratulated the freed hostages, but made clear that their release fell short of his call to free all the captives. 'Hamas has just released three Hostages from GAZA, including an American Citizen. They seem to be in good shape! This differs from their statement last week that they would not release any Hostages,' Trump said on Saturday on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Israel will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O’CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES. The United States will back the decision they make!' he added, seemingly referring to U.S. Eastern Time, which is 7 p.m. in Israel. The president’s deadline was a reference to his previous warning that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed on Gaza if Hamas did not release all the hostages. Seventy-three hostages remain inside the Strip, including 70 kidnapped on Oct. 7. Saturday’s exchange of hostages for terrorists was the sixth such round under Phase 1 of the ceasefire that took effect on Jan. 19 and is to end on March 1. Talks are ongoing on Phase 2 and 3, but it remains to be seen if they will be implemented or if war will resume.

Wedding of peace’: Children of Russian and Ukrainian rabbis marry...	At the wedding, Minister of Housing and Construction of the Israeli government, Zeev Elkin, who migrated to Israel from Ukraine in 1990, said a prayer for the return of all the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. By TPS Rivka Lazar, daughter of the Chief Rabbi of Russia Berl Lazar, and Sholom Wolf, son of the Chief Rabbi of Odessa and Southern Ukraine Avraham Wolf, got married yesterday in Jerusalem. Three thousand guests attended the ceremony, where the couple stood beneath the chuppah (traditional Jewish wedding canopy). The wedding host announced that this was going to be 'the chuppah of the piece.' 'The Chassidic world has always transgressed boundaries,' one of the guests of the ceremony who asked not to be identified told TPS-IL. 'It is not really so important that Russia and Ukraine are at war. Jews still remain friends and relatives, and that is how it always has been.' When the marriage was announced last November at the annual Congress of Chabad Ambassadors in New York, the popular joke was that US President Donald Trump had done the ‘shidduch’ (the matchmaking process in Hebrew). At the wedding, Minister of Housing and Construction of the Israeli government, Zeev Elkin, who migrated to Israel from Ukraine in 1990, said a prayer for the return of all the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The guests were offered a souvenir gift from the wedding – a collection of articles by the late Lubavitcher Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the spiritual leader of the Chabad movement. Berl Lazar has never condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Unlike leaders of other confessions in Russia, including Russian Patriarch Kirill or the Grand Mufti of Russia, Rawil Ğaynetdin, he has not supported it, either.

Azerbaijan becomes first Muslim-majority country to include antis...	The study did not find signs of Islamism or radicalism, instead noting a focus on a secular and inclusive national identity. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Azerbaijan has become the first Muslim-majority country to include a definition of antisemitism in its textbooks, according to a new report assessing the Azerbaijani educational system. The Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se), a nonprofit organization that analyzes schoolbooks and curricula around the world, examined 53 textbooks from Azerbaijan’s national curriculum, identifying significant improvements, such as the removal of anti-Israel narratives and the absence of Islamist rhetoric. As part of a series on Central Asian curricula produced in collaboration with the Ruderman Family Foundation, IMPACT-se is also examining the educational systems of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The new report released on Thursday not only highlights the inclusion of positive portrayals of Jews and Israel in Azerbaijan’s textbooks but also notes that these textbooks acknowledge the Holocaust as a mass genocide in which six million Jews were murdered. According to the London-based NGO, Azerbaijan’s national curriculum promotes ideals of diversity and tolerance, and offers a balanced view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The study did not find signs of Islamism or radicalism, instead noting a focus on a secular and inclusive national identity. 'Azerbaijan promotes the freedom of religion and tolerance, creating an open environment for all religions to flourish, including Judaism,' the study concluded. 'Students are taught the value of tolerance and harmony in modern society, and examples of Jewish prayer and rituals are incorporated into the curriculum.' The report highlighted 'promising progress and developments' in the revisions made for the 2024-25 school year, with Judaism being 'highly regarded in the textbooks' and some Biblical narratives included in the education system. For example, one key aspect was the inclusion of a definition of antisemitism, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim-majority country to do so and, according to the report, reflecting its commitment to promoting tolerance and fighting racism. In line with these goals, the country’s national curriculum also correctly portrays the Holocaust as a genocide of six million Jews, highlighting antisemitic measures such as arbitrary killings and imprisonment rather than trying to downplay or deny the Nazis’ atrocities. 'Antisemitism and the Holocaust are addressed within the framework of rejecting racism and totalitarian regimes,' the study said. The report also found that these textbooks explain the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a more balanced way, attributing its origins to Arab rejection of the 1947 UN Partition Plan and using terms like 'taken over' or 'captured' instead of 'occupied' when referring to territories under Israeli control. New revisions removed references to Zionism as racist and reclassified Palestinian violence, once called 'guerrilla warfare,' as terrorism, acknowledging its negative global impact. Additionally, geography textbooks now recognize Israel as a Jewish state. Despite these advancements, IMPACT-se highlighted the lack of Azerbaijani Jewish history and broader Jewish historical narratives, pointing to this as an area for further improvement. However, the findings in 'Israel and Jews in Azerbaijani Education,' the title of the Impact-se report, are the latest signs of the friendly relations between the two countries. Israel is presented as an ally, with references to shared military expertise, and derogatory references to domestic and international policy have been tempered. 'The textbooks demonstrate a clear rejection of the extreme Islamist values promoted by their near-neighbor Iran,' IMPACT–se CEO Marcus Sheff said in a statement. 'Instead, they promote tolerance, diversity, and a heartfelt respect for Jews and Israel, which serves as an important model for many other majority-Muslim states.' Azerbaijan’s ties with Israel have long been significant, with the country serving as the Jewish state’s most vital ally in the Caucasus and Central Asia for more than three decades, fostering a partnership that spans energy security, defense, and intelligence. Last week, Israel and Azerbaijan’s state oil company, SOCAR, struck a major energy deal, marking one of the latest examples of Azerbaijan’s emerging role as a strategic player in the Middle East.

Hostages Alexandre Troufanov, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Yair Horn free...	Since the ceasefire entered into force on Jan. 19, 19 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 566 Palestinian terrorists held in Israeli prisons. By JNS Three Israeli men regained their freedom on Saturday, after 498 days of captivity in the Gaza Strip. The hostages were handed over to representatives of the Red Cross at a staged event in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip, shortly after 10 a.m., and to the IDF and the Israeli Security Agency (Shin Bet) at approximately 10:30, and were being escorted to Israeli territory for an initial medical examination. Alexandre ('Sasha') Troufanov, 29, who has dual Russian citizenship, had been held by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist organization, while American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, and Argentinian-Israeli Yair Horn, 46, were captives of Hamas. In return, Israel is to release 369 terrorists later on Saturday—36 serving life sentences, most of who will go to the Gaza Strip or Egypt, and 333 terrorism suspects apprehended inside the Gaza Strip since the Hamas-led invasion of the northwestern Negev on Oct. 7, 2023, according to figures from the Palestinian Authority Prisoners Ministry. All three hostages were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Troufanov was abducted along with his mother, Yelena Trufanov; his grandmother Irena Tati; and his girlfriend, Sapir Cohen. His mother and grandmother were freed by Hamas on Nov. 29, 2023, at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Cohen was released as part of a ceasefire deal that same month. Troufanov’s father, Vitaly, was killed during the Oct. 7 massacre. Sagui Dekel-Chen was also taken from Nir Oz during the terrorist invasion. His mother, Neomit, was taken captive along with neighbors in an electric cart that was headed toward Gaza when an Israeli Air Force helicopter shot at the terrorists and driver. Neomit was wounded and escaped. Dekel-Chen’s third daughter, Shachar, was born two months later. Yair Horn’s brother Eitan, 38, who was visiting from Kfar Saba, was also kidnapped and is still in the Gaza Strip. Since the ceasefire entered into force on Jan. 19, 19 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 566 Palestinian terrorists held in Israeli prisons. The latter figure is to rise to 935 later on Saturday. During the first six weeks of the ceasefire, a total of 33 hostages are set to be freed in exchange for approximately 1,900 Palestinian terrorists held in Israel. Hamas says eight on the list of 33 captives have died inside the Gaza Strip. Saturday’s exchange of hostages for terrorists was the sixth such round under Phase 1 of the ceasefire that took effect on Jan. 19 and is to end on March 1. Talks are ongoing on Phase 2 and 3. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Gazan terrorists killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Seventy-three hostages remain inside the Strip, including 70 kidnapped on Oct. 7.

Israel has stated it will resume combat in Gaza if three hostages are not freed on time, after Hamas announced it was delaying the releases in response to alleged Israeli ceasefire violations. By Joshua Marks, JNS Three hostages will be released by Gaza-based terrorist groups on Saturday, according to a Hamas official on Friday, in line with the terms of the ceasefire. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office published their names after it said the list was received from Hamas via mediators Qatar and Egypt.

The Hamas official confirmed to Reuters that Dekel-Chen was among those set to be released from captivity. Separately, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist group said that it would free Russian-Israeli Troufanov as part of the arrangement. Israel has stated it will resume combat in Gaza if three hostages are not freed on time, after Hamas announced it was delaying the releases in response to alleged Israeli ceasefire violations. Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump called for the ceasefire to be abandoned if Hamas did not release all hostages held in Gaza by noon Saturday.

By JNS Hamas called for 'solidarity marches' on Friday, Saturday and Sunday to protest against U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to remove the Gazan population from the Strip in order to rebuild it. 'We … call on the masses of our people, our Arab and Islamic nation, and the free people of the world to go out in massive solidarity marches' to denounce 'the plans to displace our Palestinian people from their land,' the terrorist group said in a statement on Wednesday. Trump said that the United States will 'take over' Gaza, speaking during a press conference at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Feb. 4. Initially, Trump said Palestinians could return to Gaza, but he reversed himself on Feb. 10, telling Fox News host Bret Baier that Palestinians who leave the Gaza Strip would not return under his plan 'because they’re gonna have much better housing' elsewhere. Trump has suggested that the current population of Gaza would be moved to one large site or various locations. In an unverified report, Israel’s Channel 12 claimed that three areas being considered are Morocco, Somaliland, and Puntland, a region in northeast Somalia that declared itself an autonomous state in 1998. Netanyahu expressed support for the plan and a poll found that most Israeli Jews did so as well. Meanwhile, the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel struck on Jan. 19 appears to be disintegrating. Mediators Egypt and Qatar are attempting to resuscitate it as a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo for talks, the BBC reported on Thursday. Netanyahu said on Tuesday that unless Hamas returns all Israeli hostages by noon on Saturday, Feb. 15, the ceasefire will expire and the Israel Defense Forces will resume fighting until it totally defeats Hamas. Netanyahu’s ultimatum followed an 'in-depth, four-hour discussion' by the Cabinet. 'We all expressed outrage at the shocking state of our three hostages who were freed last Saturday. We all also welcomed President Trump’s demand for the release of our hostages by noon on Saturday,' the prime minister wrote. Netanyahu has ordered the IDF to amass forces in and around the Gaza Strip 'in light of Hamas’s statement about its decision to violate the [ceasefire] agreement,' Netanyahu said, referring to Hamas’s announcement that it would delay the release of hostages until further notice. The statement by Netanyahu announcing the ultimatum followed remarks by Trump on Feb. 10, who suggested Saturday noon as a deadline after which 'all hell will break loose' unless Hamas frees all hostages.

Trump also accused South Africa in his executive order of working with Iran 'to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.' By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner South Africa has vowed to continue pursuing its case against Israel at Trump also accused South Africa in his executive order of working with Iran 'to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.'the United Nations’ top court accusing the Jewish state of committing genocide in Gaza, saying it will not change course despite strong US opposition. There is 'no chance' of South Africa withdrawing its case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague, Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told the Financial Times in a new interview. 'Standing by our principles sometimes has consequences, but we remain firm that this is important for the worldLamola, and the rule of law,' he added. The comments from South Africa’s top diplomat came after US President Donald Trump last week signed an executive order to 'halt foreign aid or assistance' to South Africa partly in response to the country’s ICJ case and anti-Israel stance. Trump’s order was also a response to South Africa’s new land expropriation law, which the US argues discriminates against Afrikaners, a minority South African ethnic group of European descent. During the interview, Lamola denied such accusations, stating that the White House’s statements were 'misinformation.' He also argued that the land reform is not 'arbitrary,' but an essential measure to rectify the land ownership inequalities left by apartheid. Trump also accused South Africa in his executive order of working with Iran 'to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.' 'While we do have a good relationship with Iran, we don’t have any nuclear programs with them, nor any trade to speak of,' Lamola said. US intelligence agencies have for years described Iran as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism, and Iranian leaders routinely declare their intention of destroying Israel. Trump’s executive order puts at risk not only $440 million in aid to South Africa but also tariff-free access to US markets under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, presenting a major challenge for the South African coalition government, which took power last year after the ruling African National Congress (ANC) lost its majority in parliament for the first time in South Africa’s post-apartheid democratic history. The ANC still remained the largest party and retained power at the national level through a coalition. 'We are willing to engage with them to persuade them, if they are willing to be persuaded,' Lamola said. Since December 2023, South Africa has been pursuing its case at the ICJ accusing Israel of committing 'state-led genocide' in its defensive war against the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. Israeli leaders have condemned the case as an 'obscene exploitation' of the Genocide Convention, noting that the Jewish state is targeting terrorists who use civilians as human shields in its military campaign. Meanwhile, South Africa’s Jewish community have lambasted the case as 'grandstanding' rather than actual concern for those killed in the Middle Eastern conflict. Last year, the ICJ ruled there was 'plausibility' to South Africa’s claims that Palestinians had a right to be protected from genocide. However, the top UN court did not make a determination on the merits of South Africa’s allegations, which may take years to go through the judicial process, nor did it call for Israel to halt its military campaign. Instead, the ICJ issued a more general directive that Israel must make sure it prevents acts of genocide. The ruling also called for the release of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the terrorist group’s invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Last month, Cuba officially became the latest country to join South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, following Ireland, Nicaragua, Colombia, Mexico, Libya, Bolivia, Turkey, the Maldives, Chile, Spain, and 'Palestine.' Since the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, the South African government has been one of the fiercest critics of Israel’s military campaign, which seeks to free the hostages kidnapped by the terrorists and dismantle Hamas’s military and administrative control in Gaza. In late 2023, South Africa temporarily withdrew its diplomats from Israel and shut down its embassy in Tel Aviv, saying the government was 'extremely concerned at the continued killing of children and innocent civilians' in Gaza. Then in December of that year, South Africa hosted two Hamas officials who attended a government-sponsored conference in solidarity with the Palestinians. One of the officials had been sanctioned by the US government for his role with the terrorist organization. Months later, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa led the crowd at an election rally in a chant of 'From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free' — a popular slogan among anti-Israel activists that has been widely interpreted as a genocidal call for the destruction of the Jewish state, which is located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.

Iran to build 1,000 nuclear sites if ‘enemy’ destroys 100, presid...	Pezeshkian also criticized the United States for pursuing a 'contradictory' approach to Iran, saying that while President Donald Trump claims he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal, he also imposes harsh sanctions on Tehran. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Thursday warned that if 'enemies' attack Iran’s nuclear facilities, the country will quickly rebuild and multiply them, seemingly responding to new reports of a possible Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites by the middle of this year. '[Enemies] threaten us that they will hit our nuclear facilities … If you strike a hundred of those, we will build a thousand other ones,' Pezeshkian said during a speech in the southern province of Bushehr, according to Iranian state media. 'You can target the buildings and locations, but you cannot target those who build them,' he said, adding that Iranian 'experts' will continue to expand the country’s nuclear program. Pezeshkian’s comments came after a Washington Post report claimed that Israel may launch a preemptive strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities in Fordow and Natanz by mid-year, citing US intelligence assessments. Such an operation could exploit extensive damage done to Iran’s military capabilities in October, when Israel devastated Iranian air defense systems and ballistic missile production facilities in a coordinated, three-wave strike. The attack was a response to Iran targeting the Israeli homeland with 181 ballistic missiles weeks earlier. During his meeting in Bushehr, Pezeshkian criticized the United States for pursuing a 'contradictory' approach to Iran, saying that while President Donald Trump claims he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal, he also imposes harsh sanctions on Tehran. 'The enemy wants us to be humiliated before them with sanctions and threats, but we will not be subjugated and we will solve our problems by relying on our people,' Pezeshkian said. 'We will run the country by relying on our domestic capabilities.' Last week, Trump signed a presidential memorandum restoring his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. However, Trump has also denied that the US and Israel are planning to carry out a military strike on Iran, saying he instead wants to reach a 'nuclear peace agreement' with Tehran. In response to Trump’s comments, Iran’s so-called 'supreme leader,' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the idea of negotiating with Washington, calling the idea 'unwise' and 'dishonorable' days later. In an interview with Fox News, Trump also mentioned the possibility of Israel striking Iran, emphasizing that he would rather reach an agreement with Tehran to stop it from obtaining nuclear weapons. 'Everyone thinks Israel, with our help or our approval, will go in and bomb the hell out of them. I would prefer that not to happen,' Trump said. Amid increasing tensions, the commander of Iran’s conventional air force, Hamid Vahedi, also threatened to retaliate against any attack on Tehran. 'We tell all countries, friends and foes alike, that our country’s doctrine is defensive, but we will respond with force against any enemy attack,' he said. The US, Israel, and other allied countries fear that Iran’s nuclear program is ultimately designed to produce nuclear bombs. Iran has claimed that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes rather than building weapons. However, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported in December that Iran had greatly accelerated uranium enrichment to up to 60 percent purity, close to the roughly 90 percent weapons-grade level, at its Fordow site dug into a mountain. The UK, France, and Germany said in a statement at the time that there is no 'credible civilian justification' for Iran’s recent nuclear activity, arguing it 'gives Iran the capability to rapidly produce sufficient fissile material for multiple nuclear weapons.' According to US intelligence reports detailed in The Wall Street Journal, US officials believe that an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities would only delay Tehran’s program for a few weeks or months, yet Israeli officials believe it would have a significant impact. Israel is reportedly considering two potential strike options, both of which would require US support for aerial refueling, intelligence gathering, and surveillance. Of these two options, one is reported to involve Israeli fighter jets launching ballistic missiles from the air without entering Iranian territory, while the other would see aircraft deploying bunker-busting bombs over Iranian nuclear sites. The Trump administration recently approved the sale of training kits for this type of strike. In November, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Iran was 'more vulnerable than ever to attacks on its nuclear facilities.' 'We have the opportunity to achieve our most important goal – to thwart and eliminate the existential threat to the State of Israel,' he said in a post on X. In my first meeting today with the @IDF General Staff Forum, I emphasized: Iran is more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities.

ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan officially sanctioned by Trump admin, b...	The ICC responded to Trump with a forceful condemnation, stressing that the court produces 'independent and impartial' work. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The United States has imposed sanctions on International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan in accordance with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump, the US Treasury Department confirmed on Thursday. Khan was sanctioned by the US after spearheading the ICC’s issuing arrest warrants for Israeli leaders over their role in the ongoing war against the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. The White House announced on Monday that Khan would be the first member of the ICC to be issued personal sanctions, and both the White House and Treasury Department noted on Thursday that he has been added to the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. Khan’s assets in the United States are now frozen, and he is banned from entering the country. The announcement came on the heels of Trump’s executive order last week to punish members of the ICC for targeting Israel. Trump’s order lambasted the ICC for its 'illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.' Trump stated that the ICC 'abused its power' to pursue an unsubstantiated and politically motivated criminal case against Israeli leaders. The ICC responded to Trump with a forceful condemnation, stressing that the court produces 'independent and impartial' work. 'The court stands firmly by its personnel and pledges to continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world,' the ICC said. Trump signed the executive order after Senate Democrats blocked legislation to sanction the ICC in January. The bill ultimately failed by a vote of 54-45, with Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) being the sole Democrat to vote in favor of punishing the ICC. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) criticized the bill as 'poorly drafted and deeply problematic.' The House had passed the legislation. In November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and now-deceased Hamas terror leader Ibrahim al-Masri (better known as Mohammed Deif) for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. The ICC said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for starvation in Gaza and the persecution of Palestinians — charges vehemently denied by Israel, which has provided significant humanitarian aid into the war-torn enclave throughout the war. US and Israeli officials issued blistering condemnations of the ICC move, decrying the court for drawing a moral equivalence between Israel’s democratically elected leaders and the heads of Hamas, the Palestinian terrorist group that launched the ongoing war in Gaza with its massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The ICC has no jurisdiction over Israel as it is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the court. Other countries including the US have similarly not signed the ICC charter. However, the ICC has asserted jurisdiction by accepting 'Palestine' as a signatory in 2015, despite no such state being recognized under international law.

‘We’re very lucky you’re here,’ Vance tells Holocaust survivor on...	The visit included a tour, history and a wreath-laying ceremony next to a large metal sculpture of seven contorted bodies labeled '1933-1945,' the years the camp operated, per the pool. By Izzy Salant, JNS U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, met with Abba Naor, a Holocaust survivor, and with Karl Freller, the director of the Bavarian Memorial Foundation, and other officials at Dachau, the site of a former concentration camp in Germany, on Thursday. 'You look better than I do, and I’m 40,' Vance told Naor, per the pool report. The report noted that the two spoke, as it snowed lightly, in front of a gate with the sign 'Arbeit macht frei' and that most of the discussion was inaudible to the pool. Vance’s visit follows Mike Pence’s and Joe Biden’s when they were vice president, per the Associated Press. (Kamala Harris did not appear to visit the site, per public reports.) A guide told the vice president and his wife that prisoners 'had to cede everything they had with them' and showed the two 'a display filled with the effects of a prisoner from Czechoslovakia,' per the pool. Vance 'asked the guide: ‘Do we know what happened to him after the war?’ The guide says he survived but that he wasn’t exactly sure about the details,' it added. 'Mrs. Vance asked if there were any special provisions for survivors after the war. The guide replied that people who returned to Communist countries behind the Iron Curtain weren’t always treated well and that their loyalties were questioned.' Naor showed Vance a card with his prisoner information and said, 'I’m still here,' per the pool. 'Well, we’re very lucky you’re here,' Vance said, putting his hand on Naor’s shoulder. The visit included a tour, history and a wreath-laying ceremony next to a large metal sculpture of seven contorted bodies labeled '1933-1945,' the years the camp operated, per the pool. Vance laid a wreath with a red, white and blue ribbon stenciled with 'We remember' and 'United States of America' in gold lettering, per the AP. Inside the camp, the delegation was shown the intake area of the concentration camp, which also featured a large map of the Nazi concentration camp network per the pool. 'I’ve read a lot about the Holocaust in books, but being here and seeing it up close in person really drives home what unspeakable evil was committed, and why we should be committed to ensuring that it never happens again,' Vance said, per the AP. 'Moving visit to Dachau Memorial underscoring U.S. commitment to Holocaust remembrance and commemorating the 80th anniversary of the camp’s liberation by U.S. forces on April 29, 1945,' stated the U.S. embassy in Berlin. The embassy added that Vance and his wife 'were touched by meeting Abba Noar, one of the last remaining Holocaust survivors.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was also scheduled to be in Germany on Thursday to take part in the Munich Security Conference and the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, per the U.S. State Department. Rubio is also slated to travel to Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, from Feb. 15 to 18, per the State Department. 'Secretary Rubio’s engagements with senior officials will promote U.S. interests in advancing regional cooperation, stability and peace,' Foggy Bottom added. 'The trip will center on freeing American and all other hostages from Hamas captivity, advancing to Phase II of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and countering the destabilizing activities of the Iranian regime and its proxies.'

Trump announces Israel-India trade route running through Israel	Trump: 'It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the U.S., connecting our partners, roads, railways, and undersea cables.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, U.S. President Donald Trump declared that a new trade route between the two countries—passing through Israel—will be 'the greatest in history.' 'It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the U.S., connecting our partners, roads, railways, and undersea cables,' Trump said while meeting Modi at the White House. Trump acknowledged that the trade route would be 'costly,' but emphasized that it is crucial for the countries to 'stay advanced and remain the leader.' The President also expressed confidence that the friendship between Israel and India is 'the strongest it has ever been.' He added that they would discuss the long-standing trade disparities between the two countries and expected 'wonderful trade deals' in the future. 'We’ll begin negotiations to address the long-standing disparities that should have been resolved over the past four years,' stated the U.S. President. Additionally, Trump announced that the U.S. would begin selling fighter jets to India. 'Starting this year, we’ll significantly increase military sales to India by billions of dollars. We're also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters,' Trump said. Minister of Economy and Industry, Nir Barkat, traveled to India with Israel's largest business delegation on Monday. The two-day visit is aimed at strengthening economic relations between Israel and India, expanding trade opportunities, and fostering technological collaboration. The delegation's departure marks a new phase in the growing economic partnership between the two nations. 'The departure of this economic delegation to India represents a critical step in enhancing our ties, boosting Israel’s economy through increased exports, and lowering living costs by expanding imports,' said Barkat. 'At the invitation of Indian Economy Minister Piyush Goyal, we are embarking on a mission to unlock new markets, boost trade, and eliminate barriers.'

US Sec of State Rubio invites Arab States that don’t like Trump G...	All these countries claim to care about Palestinians, but none of them are willing to take any in. None have a history of doing anything for Gaza,' Rubio said. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News U.S. Senator Marco Rubio invited Arab nations to propose a post-war plan for Gaza, especially if they are critical of U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Gaza's civilian population. Arab nations have expressed disapproval of Trump’s plan, which calls for the U.S. to take control and rebuild Gaza, while relocating its civilian population to neighboring countries. After meeting with President Trump, King Abdullah of Jordan agreed to take in 2,000 sick Gazan children, though he opposed relocating the broader Gaza population. Rubio made these remarks before departing on a trip to the Middle East, where he is set to meet with leaders from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel. He stated that the purpose of the trip was to explore potential solutions to the Gaza conflict and its aftermath. Speaking on the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton radio show, Rubio said, 'Hopefully they’ll have a strong plan to present to the president,' referring to Arab nations. 'The only plan right now — which they don’t like — is the Trump plan. So, if they have a better plan, now is the time to present it.' In response to Trump's relocation proposal, Arab officials emphasized their solidarity with the Palestinian people. Rubio argued that if these nations truly care for Palestinians, they should offer a viable solution for post-war Gaza. 'All these countries claim to care about Palestinians, but none of them are willing to take any in. None have a history of doing anything for Gaza,' Rubio added. Rubio also acknowledged that many Arab states are acting in good faith to find solutions, but he emphasized that the future of Gaza cannot include Hamas as a political or military power. 'If the countries in the region can’t address that issue, then Israel will have to step in, and we’ll end up back where we’ve been,' he said. On Tuesday, Egyptian officials announced they were preparing a 'comprehensive proposal' for Gaza that would not involve relocating its civilian population.

He said he’d take Jews ‘back to Poland.’ Gretchen Whitmer took hi...	Siblani is a vocal critic of Israel and was a leader in the 'uncommitted' movement that opposed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris over U.S. support for Israel in its war with the terrorist group Hamas. By Chuck Ross, The Washington Free Beacon One of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s (D.) guests on an official state trip to the Middle East this week is an anti-Israel activist who hailed the leader of Hezbollah as a 'hero' and recently called for Jews to be sent 'back to Poland.' Whitmer took 17 local officials, businessmen, community leaders, and the head of the Michigan National Guard on a trip to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to strengthen economic ties to the region. A press release and photos from the first day of the trip show that one of Whitmer’s hand-picked guests was Osama Siblani, the publisher of the Arab American News. Whitmer's 2025 official state trip to the Middle East, including Osama Siblani (Governor Gretchen Whitmer / Facebook). It’s a controversial choice for Whitmer, considered a top contender for the Democratic presidential primary in 2028. Siblani is a vocal critic of Israel and was a leader in the 'uncommitted' movement that opposed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris over U.S. support for Israel in its war with the terrorist group Hamas. And Siblani has gone far beyond simple criticism of the Jewish state. Siblani has for years defended and praised Hamas and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terrorist groups. At a rally in Dearborn he organized on Sept. 25, Siblani hailed then-Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah as a 'hero.' 'They want us to be afraid of praising our leaders and martyrs, but today we say to them that our martyrs are heroes and our leaders are great, especially the great Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah,' Siblani said of the Hezbollah leader who was assassinated in an Israeli airstrike days later. After chants of 'death to Israel' broke out during Siblani’s speech, Siblani responded, 'Believe me, they will take care of the job,' an apparent reference to Hezbollah, according to the Middle East Media Research Institute. And he issued a message to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Jews: 'We will take you back to Poland.' In 2022, Siblani urged Arabs to 'fight within [their] means' against Israel, whether with 'stones,' 'guns,' or 'their hands.' He has bragged that he refused to condemn Hamas during a conference call with Biden White House officials in 2021. Siblani’s rhetoric should be no secret to Whitmer, who will leave office next year. The Anti-Defamation League and other Jewish groups have condemned Siblani’s remarks over the years and blasted the White House and Biden campaign last year for sending officials to meet with Siblani in Dearborn in hopes of gaining his political support. Whitmer may like to stay in Siblani’s good graces, given his influence within Michigan’s large Arab and Muslim community and her apparent presidential ambitions. Siblani has published Arab American News, the largest Arab-language newspaper in the country, since 1984 and frequently hosts rallies and other events in Dearborn, one of the nation’s largest Muslim-majority cities. Democrats consider Michigan part of their 'Blue Wall' path to winning the Electoral College, making the state’s Arab and Muslim vote key to victory. But Whitmer’s coziness with a terrorist sympathizer may not play well in other battleground states. Whitmer has catered to Siblani throughout her tenure. In 2022, she met with Siblani at his newspaper’s office after he publicly criticized her for visiting Israel. 'Governor Whitmer will hear from us soon on her wrong and offensive trip to Israel as its army brutally killing [sic] innocent Palestinians including children while carpet bombing Gaza,' Siblani said. He published photos after their one-on-one meeting and said Whitmer accepted his invitation to visit Arab countries. It’s unclear who paid for Siblani’s attendance on the trip. Whitmer’s other guests on the Middle Eastern trip include Maj. Gen. Paul D. Rogers, the adjutant general of the Michigan National Guard, and a variety of city and county officials from around Michigan. Several other attendees have been highly critical of Israel, including Wayne County executive Warren Evans and deputy county executive Assad Turfe. Last year, Evans and Turfe were spotted in the front row at anti-Semitic preacher Louis Farrakhan’s speech in Detroit, where the Nation of Islam leader claimed that the United States is 'enslaved' to Jews.

‘Students Against Nazi Extremism’ target Tesla cars in California...	In Europe, where Tesla has significant market presence, the response has been particularly fierce. By Jewish Breaking News California Tesla owners have become unwitting targets in the controversy still surrounding Elon Musk’s Nazi-like salute and his mounting influence in Washington. According to an investigative report by The Independent, a fringe group has been leaving notes on Tesla cars in the Bay Area with the words 'No Nazis in America,' with at least one tied to a brick. Calling themselves 'Students Against Nazi Extremism,' the group mailed a manifesto to local news outlet Lost Coast Outpost claiming responsibility for delivering threats to 13 Tesla owners across Arcata and Seaside. The three-page document denounced Musk as an 'overt Nazi with a history of fascist, racist, misogynist and criminal behavior' and outlined plans to vandalize Tesla vehicles in Rohnert Park and Hayward. Meanwhile, the anti-Tesla movement has now spread beyond California, with protesters gathering outside Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Manhattan and Maine, voicing their opposition to what they view as the billionaire overreach into federal government affairs. In Europe, where Tesla has significant market prIn Europe, where Tesla has significant market presence, the response has been particularly fierce.esence, the response has been particularly fierce. Outside Barcelona, French artist James Kina installed a provocative red raised arm at a Tesla charging station. In Germany, an image of Musk’s inauguration day Nazi-like salute was projected onto the exterior wall of a Tesla factory in Berlin, accompanied by the word 'heil.' Musk’s vocal support of the far-right AfD party has already sparked significant backlash from moderate and liberal Germans. For Tesla owners caught in the middle, their vehicles now carry an unintended symbol of fascism in a culture war they never asked to join.

80-year old freed hostage Gadi Moses describes walking 7km, solvi...	At some point, he realized he had to stop expecting immediate rescue and shift his focus to surviving each day. He taught himself to think differently.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Freed hostage, 80-year-old Gadi Moses, kept himself occupied during his captivity by walking seven kilometers a day in his tiny room and solving complex math problems in his head. Moses' nephew, Shai, said in an interview, 'At some point, he realized he had to stop expecting immediate rescue and shift his focus to surviving each day. He taught himself to think differently, to keep pushing forward, and to avoid the crushing disappointment of not being freed the next morning.' Moses had only learned of the murder of his long-term partner, Efrat Katz, 68, during his captivity and discovered that his daughter, Moran, had survived the Hamas invasion on October 7th when he was freed after 483 days. Although Moses was not held in tunnels like other hostages, he was confined in isolation in a tiny, dark, unsanitary room and given very little food. To comfort himself, Moses would have imaginary conversations with his loved ones. He hadn’t had any contact with another Israeli until he was escorted by Arbel Yehoud, 29, amid chaotic and hostile crowds in Gaza prior to their release. Moses talked to his captors and even negotiated access to a television, where he saw Israelis protesting for the release of hostages. This gave him strength and helped him understand that the nation was fighting for their return home. An agronomist and potato expert, Moses told his captors that, when the war ended and if peace were achieved, he would teach them how to farm. He also fearlessly debated the terrorists about the ownership of the land of Israel. The Hamas captors taunted him, asking, 'Where are your parents from? Go back there!' When they asserted that their ancestors lived in the land before the Jews, Moses responded, 'What are you talking about? Our people lived in these places 3,000 years ago!'

Lebanese government prevents Iranian plane with funds for Hezboll...	The Lebanese government is fulfilling a provision in the ceasefire agreement with Israel, which requires it to prevent Iran from transferring funds to Hezbollah. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Lebanese government is preventing a plane scheduled to fly to Beirut from leaving Tehran's airport due to suspicions that it is being used to transfer funds to Hezbollah, according to reports from Arab media. By stopping the plane from flying to Beirut, the Lebanese government is fulfilling a provision in the ceasefire agreement with Israel, which requires it to prevent Iran from transferring funds to the Lebanese terror group. Passengers at Tehran's airport protested the fact that the plane was prevented from traveling on its scheduled route. Hezbollah supporters gathered outside the airport, waving flags associated with the terror group, protesting the decision by blocking the road and burning tires. IDF Arabic Language Spokesman Avichay Adraee revealed that Hezbollah and the Iranian Quds Force have been using international flights to receive funds from Iran. 'The IDF stays in communication with the ceasefire monitoring mechanism and regularly shares detailed information to disrupt these transfers. Despite these efforts, we believe that some of these money-smuggling attempts have been successful,' Adraee stated. He declared, 'The IDF will prevent Hezbollah from arming itself and will use all available means to enforce the ceasefire agreements, ensuring the security of Israel's citizens.' Iran is attempting to rebuild its weakened proxy group, Hezbollah, by flying millions of dollars to the terror organization through Beirut International Airport, a practice that the IDF has warned must stop immediately. The discovery of Iran transferring funds to terror groups through commercial flights comes just days before the deadline for Israel to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon. A Trump administration official recently confirmed that Washington expects the IDF to leave the region by February 18. However, reports suggest that Israel is lobbying to extend that deadline. Displaced residents of northern Israel’s border region, who were evacuated from their homes shortly after the October 7, 2023, terror onslaught, have still been unable to return to their communities. The Israeli government set March 1st as the date by which displaced northerners are expected to return home, but that timeframe now appears unlikely.

Burned trees, traumatized animals: Nature is revealing the unseen...	Every winter, around 50,000 common cranes pause their migration to Africa to settle in the Hula Valley, but last year, relentless rocket fire from Lebanon—just 30 kilometers away—caused their numbers to plummet by 70%. By Deborah Danan, JTA The trees abutting the road leading to Biriya Forest, a nature preserve in northern Israel, at first resemble spruces turning autumnal shades of red, a sight reminiscent of landscapes in America or Europe but rare in Israel. A closer look, however, reveals that the trees are only charred remnants — the devastating result of rocket-induced wildfires that destroyed thousands of acres of forest while Israel battled Hezbollah in Lebanon. Fires break out every year in this forest, which like many others across Israel was planted by the Jewish National Fund, known today as KKL-JNF — but they are usually brought under control quickly. This year, with the local population evacuated and weather conditions unusually extreme, things played out differently. Starting around May, as temperatures rose, nearly every rocket fired from Lebanon was likely to ignite a fire. And it wasn’t just the rockets themselves: Israeli interceptors exploded overhead, scattering fragments that ignited at multiple points within the forest. The combination of unusual winds, scorching heat and low humidity created a perfect storm that has disrupted entire ecosystems, affected wildlife habitats and undone years of work by foresters aimed at increasing biodiversity. 'We literally witnessed their life’s work go up in smoke,' said Eli Hafuta, director of the Upper Galilee and Golan Region at KKL-JNF, which was founded in 1901 to cultivate Jewish-owned land in the region and today owns 13% of all land in Israel. 'It’s a devastating sight to watch trees that have stood for 70 or 80 years go up in flames,' Hafuta said. 'Even younger trees, ones my team and I planted just a decade ago, can be reduced to ashes in just 15 minutes.' The scorched earth in Biriya Forest reflects just one of many environmental effects of nearly a year and a half of war for Israel. Less visible than the lives lost, injuries sustained and homes destroyed has been devastation to flora and fauna in both Israel’s north and south. The cascading effects continued this week as the splashy kickoff for a new forest in the western Negev to honor war victims, timed to the Jewish environmental holiday of Tu Bishvat on Thursday, was canceled amid rising security threats in the region. A handful of Israeli officials are instead holding a smaller planting ceremony in the western Negev, at a site named for an officer killed on Oct. 7, 2023. Perhaps nowhere has the war’s effect on Israeli ecosystems been more pronounced than at the Agamon Hula Valley Nature Reserve, famed for its mesmerizing bird migrations. Twice a year, hundreds of millions of birds — including cranes, pelicans, and storks — pass through the valley, in a normal year turning it into a hotspot for ecotourism, with the BBC naming it one of the top 10 birdwatching sites in the world. During the months it was closed — from Oct. 7, 2023, until well after the ceasefire on Israel’s northern border took hold in late November — the Agamon Wildlife Rehabilitation Center on the reserve turned into what staff call the world’s first wartime field hospital for animals. 'We’re the first rehabilitation center in the world with a war protocol,' said Dr. Rona Nadler-Valency, the center’s head veterinarian and director. When rockets pounded the north, Nadler-Valency and her team were evacuated from their communities, forcing the center to operate remotely, with staff caring for injured animals at home when possible. After three months, the team began returning, resuming treatment at the center under a chaotic new normal. 'We would be in the middle of surgery, an animal on the operating table, when the sirens would go off,' Nadler-Valency said. 'We’d have to leave everything and run to the shelter — sometimes dozens of times a day.' At other times, Nadler-Valency and her team were caught outdoors when sirens sounded, forcing them to drop to the ground for cover. 'Those moments felt like pure insanity, but at least we were able to keep doing our work,' she said. With so few civilians remaining in the north, many of the wounded animals were brought to the center by soldiers. In one case, Lilit, a tawny owl brought in after being hit by a military vehicle, suffered a severe head injury that temporarily left her blind and deaf. Lilit was carefully monitored and rehabilitated in a specialized acclimation cage. Treatment was complicated by the ongoing missile fire, requiring the team to carefully time their visits to her, but eventually the team managed to restore her sight, hearing and flight. After a month and a half in the cage, Lilit was released back into the wild with a transmitter on her back, allowing the team to track her recovery and ensure she could hunt and survive, as well as gain insights into how owls adjust to life after similar injuries. 'Cases like Lilit’s,' Nadler-Valency reflected, 'were rays of light amid the madness.' The disruption fueled other changes that scientists are now tracking. Yaron Charka, chief ornithologist at KKL-JNF — which manages the reserve and its reopened visitors’ center — observed an increase in wintering bird species this year. 'I’m seeing a great variety of birds this winter, compared with last winter, where there were few,' he said, but acknowledged that he didn’t fully understand why. Every winter, some 50,000 common cranes settle in the Hula Valley, pausing their southward migration to Africa. But last year, that number dropped by 70% amid constant rocket fire from Lebanon, just 30 kilometers from the valley. Still, Charka cautioned against attributing all of the changes to the cross-border clashes. 'During wartime, birds can change their route and bypass us in isolated instances — we saw this with Ukraine — but it’s not the whole picture,' he said, noting that the ceasefire came at the end of the migratory season and emphasizing that climate change, which is having an outsized effect on Israel, is also causing changes in the cranes’ migration habits. 'In the past two years, the arrival of the crane flocks in the fall to the Hula Valley has been significantly delayed,' he said. 'It is important that we continue to monitor this trend.' The site’s extended closure left the cranes unaccustomed to humans, so camouflaged wagons now help visitors observe them closely while minimizing disturbance. With the return of crane populations comes the resurgence of old problems, particularly the challenge of protecting local crops from the birds. Farmers have long used methods such as gas cannons and mirrors to divert the cranes to designated feeding sites, but these approaches are costly and disruptive — both to wildlife and to tourists. Now, KKL-JNF Jewish National Fund is developing a laser-based system to address the issue more sustainably. The technology, developed in conjunction with an Israeli ecotech company, employs cameras, lasers and artificial intelligence to detect crane presence and direct a laser beam that the birds perceive as chasing them, causing them to relocate. Charka, who used to work in tech, said he hoped to see the system fully operational by the next migration season. According to the reserve’s director, Inbar Shlomit Rubin, far fewer bird nests were observed in the spring — a trend for which she saw two immediate explanations. 'The unrest and insecurity led many birds to migrate further south to quieter areas of Israel,' she said. But mammals and smaller animals had no means of escaping the area. 'The noise of the war caused immense stress,' Rubin said. 'Stress negatively affects fertility.' Since the ceasefire, KKL-JNF has launched an extensive survey of the areas burned over the past year to evaluate their potential for natural regeneration. For now, most of the organization’s efforts are focused on urgent interventions in visitor-accessible areas. While the restoration of the affected areas is expected to be a long-term endeavor, Hafuta expressed optimism, highlighting forests’ remarkable ability to regenerate. He said he estimated that as many as 70% of burned trees would begin to regenerate naturally in the next year and a half. According to Rubin, in recent weeks, wildlife, too, has begun returning to the affected areas. 'We’ve noticed a very subtle, minimal return. While the long-term effects are still uncertain, we remain hopeful that [the war] won’t have a significant impact in the years to come,' Rubin said. 'The trauma the area experienced will take time to heal, but we are on the right path.'

Red Sox sign Jewish All-Star to record breaking $120 million deal	Since 2017, he’s played at least 145 games in every full season except one, missing time only during the pandemic-shortened 2020 schedule. By Jewish Breaking News The Boston Red Sox answered their critics on Wednesday Since 2017, he’s played at least 145 games in every full season except one, missing time only during the pandemic-shortened 2020 schedule.by signing Gold Glove winner Alex Bregman to a whopping 3-year, $120 million deal. It brings one of baseball’s most visible Jewish stars to Fenway Park after eight standout seasons with the Houston Astros. Drafted second overall in 2015, Bregman quickly became a cornerstone of Houston’s dynasty. After his 2016 call-up, he emerged as a consistent force in the lineup as a third baseman, helping power World Series victories in both 2017 and 2022. His Jewish identity took center stage when he drew a Star of David on his cap following the October 7 Hamas massacre. Power and consistency define Bregman’s offensive approach. He’s crossed the 20-homer threshold in each of the past three seasons. Bregman’s 13.6% strikeout rate ranked in the 94th percentile. His ability to square up pitches placed him 10th among 211 qualified hitters. Beyond the numbers, Bregman brings remarkable durability and playoff experience to Boston. Since 2017, he’s played at least 145 games in every full season except one, missing time only during the pandemic-shortened 2020 schedule. According to ESPN insider Jeff Passan, Bregman is expected to shift to second base, a position he’s played just 32 innings in his major league career. With stars Rafael Devers at third base and Triston Casas at first, Red Sox brass is betting big on Bregman’s successful transition to second base will help return Boston to contention after last year’s mediocre 81-81 finish.

Israel launches three new medical schools to address shortage of ...	According to Nadav Davidovich, Chair of the Taub Center Health Policy Program and Director of the School of Public Health at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel currently gets around 1,300 new doctors per year, with a need of around 2,000. By Anna Epshtein, TPS Israel is opening three new medical schools to address the country’s shortage of medical personnel. One, at the private Reichman University in Herzliya, welcomed its first students ten days ago. Two others, at Haifa University and Weizmann Institute of Science, are to open in October 2025. 'The opening of new medical schools is a significant development that will greatly contribute to the future of Israel’s healthcare system. Increasing the number of medical students will help reduce gaps, strengthen public healthcare, and ensure quality and accessible medical service for every citizen,' the Health Ministry said in a statement, praising the Council for Higher Education that approved the move. The School of Medicine at Reichman University, which opened on February 2, 2025, enrolls 88 graduate students who already have a BA degree in a four-year program. Weizmann Institute of Science will accommodate 40 graduate students in the first year of the program. The students will undergo clinical practice in several Israeli hospitals, including Sheba Medical Center, the largest in Israel. They will be eligible for a double degree—Doctor of Medicine and Doctorate in Research (MDPhD). 'The vision is to create a new generation of leading physician-researchers in the field of medicine and biomedical research. These will be professionals capable of identifying urgent clinical challenges, inviting patients to participate in current clinical trials, and planning and conducting innovative studies that will lead to groundbreaking medical solutions, all with the aim of promoting public health,' the Weizmann Institute statement said. The University of Haifa will accommodate 66 students in the first year and plans to increase enrollment to several dozen students in the coming years. Carmel Medical Center in Haifa will serve as its clinical base. The students will also practice at the medical centers of Clalit Health Services, the largest of Israel’s four state-mandated health service organizations. 'We hope the students will stay in the north after the six years of their studies here,' Roni Malkai, the University’s spokesperson, told TPS-IL. The shortage of medical personnel is especially acute in the Israeli periphery. 'In central Israel, the numbers per capita are close to those in OECD countries, but in the south and the north, they are up to two times lower,' Nadav Davidovich, Chair of the Taub Center Health Policy Program and Director of the School of Public Health at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev explained to TPS-IL. According to him, Israel currently gets around 1,300 new doctors per year, with a need of around 2,000. The shortage of medical personnel is a result of several factors, one of which is that thousands of doctors who came to Israel with the wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s have been retiring. 'The problem is not just the numbers but also the quality of education. Only about 40 percent of practicing doctors in Israel got their diploma in the country,' Davidovich explained. 'The rest studied abroad because there are not enough places in Israel, including in countries where education is poor. They often end up in the Israeli periphery, too.' Establishing new schools is not the only way to address the problem. Israel has also opened programs for physician assistants, who take less time than a full MD, and nurse practitioners (NPs). According to a report published in Israel Health Policy Research a year ago, the number of physicians per capita in Israel is lower than in the OECD countries—3.1 versus 3.5 per 1,000 population, respectively. 'There is a decrease in the supply of physicians in Israel resulting from the declining flow of immigrant physicians from the former Soviet Union, a large proportion of whom have reached retirement age in recent years. This problem could become worse because the number of medical students in Israel cannot increase quickly, especially because the number of clinical training sites is inadequate. The rapid population growth and anticipated aging will exacerbate the shortage,' the report said.

Two Arab Israelis arrested on charges of planning Hamas terror at...	According to the investigation, one of the suspects purchased materials to make fire bombs and 'conducted tests' to produce explosive charges with the intent to attack a bus transporting Israeli troops. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Two Arab Israelis have been arrested on suspicion of planning a series of terrorist attacks against security forces and civilians, the Israel Police and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) revealed in a statement on Thursday. The suspects, aged 18 and 21, from the towns of Qalansawe and Zemer in central Israel, expressed support for the Hamas terror group following its Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, according to the statement. The two had planned several attacks, including 'a shooting at a military facility and a combined ramming and shooting attack targeting IDF soldiers or civilians,' it continued. According to the investigation, one of the suspects purchased materials to make fire bombs and 'conducted tests' to produce explosive charges with the intent to attack a bus transporting Israeli troops. Following the arrests, a court extended the suspects’ detention. Charges were set to be filed against them on Thursday. In November, two minors from Israel’s 'triangle region' were indicted on charges of conspiring to carry out terrorist acts against security forces. The triangle region contains 11 Arab Israeli communities adjacent to the Green Line and the Samaria security barrier, including Qalansawe and Zemer, and is home to approximately 250,000 people. According to the indictment, one of the minors was recruited to a terror cell in August 2023. He allegedly received training in explosives and subsequently acquired chemical materials to conduct experiments. He then recruited three additional members, including the second minor in the indictment. The pair allegedly worked in collaboration with others, attempted to make bombs and demonstrated an intent to cause harm. Since the start of the Iron Swords war 16 months ago, there has been growing radicalization among some segments of the country’s Arab population. A poll conducted in December 2023 by the Israel Democracy Institute’s Center for Democratic Values and Institutions discovered that one-third of Israel’s Arabs disagree with the statement that the Oct. 7 attack 'does not reflect Arab society, the Palestinian people and the Islamic nation.' According to a June poll, some 14.7% of Arab Israelis believe Hamas should govern Gaza after the war. That number represents some 308,700 Israeli citizens out of an Arab Israeli population of around 2.1 million.

Afghan man arrested after running down dozens in Munich	1 dead, dozens more injured after Afghan migrant rams crowd of labor union protesters in Munich, Germany. By World Israel News Staff At least one person was killed and dozens more injured after a car plowed through a crowd in the city of Munich, Germany on Thursday. The incident occurred near Köingsplatz when a Mini Cooper rammed into a group of labor union protesters representing Verdi, Germany's largest public sector union, who had gathered in Munich to demand wage hikes for teachers and hospital workers. Local reports claim that one woman was killed in the incident, while 28 others were injured. Munich police said Thursday that they arrested the driver of the car, a 24-year-old male migrant from Afghanistan. Markus Söder, premier of the State of Bavaria, told reporters that the ramming was 'likely an attack.' 'The attack shows that something has to change in Germany - and quickly.' Police say the suspect has a history of criminal activity including drug-related offenses and theft. Germany's Der Spiegel reported that the suspect has been living in Germany since 2016, despite his asylum request having been rejected. Local media outlets have claimed the suspect posted radical Islamist materials to his social media accounts. The incident comes just ten days before German voters head to the polls, after snap elections were called following the collapse of the Social Democrats-led center-left government. Immigration is expected to play a major role in this month's federal election, with pre-election polling indicating the right-wing Alternative For Germany (AfD) is poised to become the second largest faction in the Bundestag. Alice Weidel, chairwoman of the AfD and the party's candidate for chancellor, said the attack highlighted the need to radically reform Germany's immigration policies. 'The terror driver from Munich was an Afghan asylum seeker known to police,' Weidel tweeted. 'Once again there are many seriously injured, once again women and children among the victims. My deepest sympathy goes out to the victims and their families. Should this continue forever? Migration turnaround now!'

Ex-IDF deputy chief accuses Netanyahu’s office of treason	Yair Golan, who leads the far-left party The Democrats and once served as deputy chief of the IDF, calls for investigation of Prime Minister Netanyahu's office, accusing aides of betraying Israel to Qatar. By World Israel News Staff A former Israeli lawmaker and chief of a far-left party in the Israeli Knesset accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's staff of treason on Thursday, and called for a criminal investigation of the Prime Minister's Office, citing aides' alleged financial ties to Qatar. Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of staff of the Israeli military who served as a deputy minister in the Bennett-Lapid government and became the head of the far-left The Democrats party last year, held a press conference Thursday afternoon accusing Netanyahu's office of betraying the State of Israel and demanding police launch a criminal probe. 'There is a suspicion of betrayal in the Prime Minister's Office that must be investigated,' Golan said. 'The recent revelation is not another failure, it is not another corruption event or political scandal, and it is not a misjudgment – it is allegedly evidence of a business, financial, and personal connection between the Prime Minister's Office and an enemy state before and during the war,' Golan said, noting Qatar's long-standing ties to Hamas. 'Netanyahu's closest advisors – people from the most important office in the State of Israel – allegedly received payments, maintained connections, and did business with the country that funded Hamas, a country whose leader sees Sheikh Qaradawi, a declared antisemite and prominent Israel-hater, as its spiritual teacher.' Golan held the press conference two days after Israel's Channel 12 published a report accusing PMO staffer Eli Feldstein, who worked on Netanyahu's media team, of having worked as part of a public relations team on behalf of Qatar while employed by the PMO. Feldstein is currently under house arrest in connection to the alleged leaking of government documents to the German daily Bild. Three months earlier, a report by Ha'aretz accused two other PMO employees, Yonatan Urich and Srulik Einhorn, of providing public relations services to Qatar prior to the 2022 World Cup, held in Qatar. Under the international soccer league FIFA's rules, Qatar was required to permit Israel's team and Israeli fans to enter the country, despite Doha having no official diplomatic ties to Israel at the time. A temporary Israeli consulate was established in Qatar for the World Cup to provide basic services for visiting Israelis.

Knesset backs bill to deport illegal Eritrean immigrants	Israeli parliament votes unanimously to advance legislation to deport illegal immigrants from Eritrea who express support for their native land's regime. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A bill to deport Eritreans who illegally entered Israel if they support their home government passed a preliminary reading in the Knesset 51-0 Wednesday. Yulia Malinovsky of the Opposition’s Israel Beytenu party, who submitted the proposed law in December, wrote in its explanatory portion that 'an infiltrator who supports the Eritrean regime, from which he fled on the grounds that his life was in danger, is not truly in danger and therefore is not entitled to reside in the State of Israel.' The bill allows the Interior Minister to deport such infiltrators either to their homeland or to a third country after proving that they support the regime, and it supplied several examples of such backing: organizing or participating in an event whose purpose is to show support for the government of President Isaias Afwerki, including events sponsored by the Eritrean embassy, and/or waving a picture of the country’s leader. The bill also gives the minister the right to immediately deport infiltrators if they have been convicted of an offense, whether they have been sentenced to prison time for committing the crime or not. All infiltrators notified of the intent to deport them will have the right to a hearing to present their arguments against such action. According to data from the Population and Immigration Authority, there are currently about 19,000 asylum seekers in Israel from Eritrea, and another 4,000 from Sudan. It is not known exactly how many of the illegal migrants back Afwerki, who has ruled the one-party state since Eritrea declared independence in 1993. However, there have been mass, violent melees between regime supporters and opponents in recent years, especially where the migrant community is concentrated in south Tel Aviv. In September 2023, there was a massive riot in the city in which some 200 brawlers were injured, many storefronts were damaged and widespread looting occurred. Just a few weeks later, two migrants were murdered in separate clashes in Netanya and Tel Aviv, with police in full riot gear needed to break up the violence. South Tel Aviv was the site of yet another deadly riot last May, when 50 police officers and more than 160 Eritreans were injured from being clubbed, knifed or shot. Last month, Ynet reported that the Eritrean government has paid financial guarantees to release supporters arrested in Israel following incidents of violence, theft, vandalism, and other crimes. Residents of southern Tel Aviv have been complaining for well over a decade about their inability to live normal lives among the thousands of mostly young, single illegal migrants who have taken over the streets. They have accused the police of ignoring their plight instead of showing a robust presence and thoroughly investigating all reported crimes, which have included sexual assault and rape, as well as the more common house break-ins and muggings. Malinovsky said that the bill’s preliminary passage was 'the first step in returning safety and quiet to the residents of south Tel Aviv. It is inconceivable that Israeli citizens are too afraid to leave their homes after dark.'

How USAID laundered money to the Taliban	The money-laundering operation required multiple steps and plausible deniability for USAID, the State Department, and the UN. By Daniel Greenfield, Frontpage Magazine In 2022, the DA Afghanistan Bank showed off photos of $40 million in stacks of hundred dollar bills sitting on the tarmac at Kabul International Airport. The Taliban controlled central bank described this as one of three shipments of 'humanitarian aid' amounting to over $100 million. DAB, Afghanistan’s central bank, was headed by Noor Ahmad Agha, a 'specially designated terrorist' who had been named as the 'financier of bomb-making', including the IEDs which had killed over 1,000 American soldiers, and sending money to a sanctioned figure was illegal. Despite that someone had sent a massive fortune in U.S. cash to the Taliban’s terror bank. While no international organization was willing to admit to the cash-smuggling operation, the ultimate responsibility lay with USAID. The $40 million on the tarmac was part of a much larger scheme under which USAID and the State Department provided over $1.7 billion in funding to the UN which then shipped $2.9 billion in cash to Afghanistan. The cash had to be physically shipped because it was illegal for U.S. banks to provide it to the Taliban. USAID was helping finance an illegal operation to circumvent sanctions on terrorists. Following a series of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, today, December 15, 2021, the fourth shipment of humanitarian aid of USD 19.2 million reached Afghanistan and delivered to the Afghanistan International Bank (AIB). pic.twitter.com/ng3IH3ZhS0 &mdash; Da Afghanistan Bank- Afghanistan (@AFGCentralbank) December 15, 2021 When the State Department and USAID claimed that they 'do not provide assistance to or through the Taliban' but work 'with trusted international partners with extensive experience working in challenging environments like Afghanistan', it was a half-truth at best. The 'trusted international partners' included the UN. USAID funded the UN which used an intermediary to purchase the hundred dollar bills from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where Afghanistan’s wealth, claimed by the Taliban, was being held, then contracted with a company, quite possibly Osama bin Laden’s old airline, to fly it to Afghanistan, deposit it in banks, allocate it to NGOs and then use DAB to convert the dollars into local Afghan currency. This Afghan currency was also provided by the United States which funded the printing of 20 billion in Taliban currency by European companies for which the dollars would be exchanged. 'The United States and our partners have been working hard with international banks to facilitate payment transfers from Afghanistan’s central bank to European printing companies,' State Department spokesman Ned Price had told reporters. 'This will address one of the aspects of Afghanistan’s ongoing liquidity crisis, consistent with U.S. efforts to support basic human needs.' Rather than just the ‘foreign aid’ to Afghanistan in the form of the ‘Afghanis’ that it was already arranging to print for the Taliban, the Biden administration sent dollars to them through the UN. Under the guise of humanitarian needs, $1.7 billion was provided to the UN, which used some of the money to buy dollars to fly into Afghanistan, to trade for Afghan currency, which the U.S. had also arranged to have printed on behalf of the Taliban. The exchange left the Taliban’s DAB terrorist bank with large amounts of U.S. currency that it could auction off to its own allies. The arrangement is even worse than it sounds because DAB artificially set the exchange rate of the Afghani to the dollar at a far higher rate than the black market exchange rate. And the Taliban bank used the auctions of the dollars to artificially prop up that exchange rate. USAID’s money laundering scheme not only used the UN to send a fortune in dollars to the Taliban, it allowed their terrorist bank to run a ‘dollar cartel’, buying dollars from the UN through its NGOs at favorable rates and then covertly reselling the dollars back in Pakistan to its ‘dollar cartel’ at much better rates as its rupee struggles against the dollar. During the intermediate step, DAB held ‘auctions’ of the dollars which elements linked to the Taliban, including the Haqqani network allied with Al Qaeda, reportedly ‘won’. The auctions prop up the Afghani currency and keep the Taliban in power. And the Taliban take their share at each step of the process, taxing all the various intermediaries before finally cashing out the money. Sending dollars to Afghanistan only to exchange them for Afghanis which the United States was also arranging for served absolutely no purpose except to give the Taliban liquid currency, but was justified as a way to prop up the Afghani currency as a 'humanitarian aid' measure. The money-laundering operation required multiple steps and plausible deniability for USAID, the State Department, and the UN which insisted that '[n]one of the cash brought into Afghanistan is deposited in the Central Bank of Afghanistan nor provided to the Taliban de facto authorities by the UN.' To the extent this was true, it was because the money was deposited in a 'private bank', allocated to NGOs funded by the UN which then exchanged it with DBA’s assets. USAID was able to claim plausible deniability because it was putting money into pooled UN accounts, which a report by the SIGAR Afghanistan War government watchdog revealed, 'prevents tying humanitarian assistance expenses—including for the purchase and transport of cash into Afghanistan—to a specific donor’s contribution. Putting the money into UN pooled accounts allowed USAID to claim that they 'do not provide assistance to or through the Taliban', they just put money into 'pooled UN accounts' which they do not control, and 'as a result, State and USAID do not know how much of their total contributions to the UN have been used to purchase cash for use in Afghanistan'. The UN deposits the dollars into its accounts in a conveniently unnamed ‘private bank’ in Afghanistan. Its name is surely known to the Taliban authorities, but continues to be unknown to United States officials. From there the money is distributed to the bank accounts of the NGOs funded by the UN. At that point they are most likely converted into Afghanis with DAB’s aid since the supply of the Taliban currency is controlled by Afghanistan’s central bank. That allows the UN to claim that '[n]one of the cash brought into Afghanistan is deposited in the Central Bank of Afghanistan nor provided to the Taliban de facto authorities by the UN.' The cash is not provided to the Taliban or DAB by the UN, but by the groups funded by the UN. The SIGAR report noted that 'a UN official told us that the UN’s liability ends when the recipient PIO and NGOs have the funds in their accounts.' The UN then disavows any liability for providing the money to the Taliban even as UN officials are well aware that it’s happening. The State Department responded to these revelations by falsely claiming that there are no sanctions on Afghanistan, that banks refuse to carry out wire transfers because of 'the lack of profitability' and that 'to the best of our knowledge, no electronic financial delivery systems are currently scalable to meet the liquidity needs of the UN' requiring it to instead convert billions of dollars into paper notes and ship them by plane. None of this is true or even a plausible lie. USAID declined to reply to the government watchdog’s report. The Taliban money laundering scheme was not an exception, it was how USAID, the State Department and the UN have operated for too long, not only in Afghanistan, but in Syria, Yemen, Gaza and many other terrorist areas around the world, using plausible deniability and chains of organizations to avoid accountability and direct responsibility for aiding terrorists. Americans have become the financiers of their worst enemies. It’s time for that to stop.

Report: Israel to settle for return of 3 hostages in exchange for...	Hamas reportedly willing to free 3 Israeli hostages on Saturday, a step Israel has said to have indicated would be enough to maintain the current ceasefire - despite Trump's ultimatum and mixed messages from Prime Minister Netanyahu. By World Israel News Staff The impending collapse of the Gaza ceasefire may have been averted this week, after Israel and Hamas both reportedly expressed a willingness to return to the original terms of the deal, after the Islamic terror group threatened on Monday to delay the return of three Israeli hostages, scheduled to be released on Saturday. On Wednesday, Israel's Walla outlet reported that Jerusalem has indicated to Hamas, via Egyptian and Qatari mediators, that Israel is willing to continue the Gaza ceasefire if Hamas releases three Israeli hostages on Saturday, as originally planned. Multiple Arabic media reports have stated that Hamas has also signalled its willingness to implement the latest hostage release on schedule. Citing an unnamed source, AFP reported that the Egyptian and Qatari interlocutors have secured Hamas' assurance that the Saturday hostage release of three captives will be carried out as planned. 'Hamas has confirmed to Egyptian officials its commitment… to conducting the sixth exchange of prisoners on time, on Saturday, as soon as Israel honors its commitment,' one source said. Another source told AFP that 'there is progress' towards resolving the crisis, adding that Israel has vowed to 'put in place a humanitarian protocol starting this morning.' 'Prefabricated units, tents, fuel, heavy equipment, medicine, materials for repairing hospitals and everything linked to the humanitarian protocol' will be brought into the Gaza Strip, the source continued. President Donald Trump threatened earlier this week that 'all hell' will break loose if Hamas does not return all the remaining hostages this Saturday by noon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened a full resumption of war if 'our hostages' were not returned by Saturday at noon, without specifying how many hostages would have to be released to keep the truce in place.

Trump talks with Putin about negotiating end to Ukraine war	Trump's call with Putin, the first-known conversation between the presidents since Trump's return to the White House, comes just ahead of the war's third anniversary. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he directed his national security team to 'start negotiations immediately' to end the war in Ukraine following a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful,' Trump posted on Truth Social. 'Millions of people have died in a War that would not have happened if I were President, but it did happen, so it must end. No more lives should be lost!' The Kremlin on Tuesday released American teacher Marc Fogel, who had been serving a 14-year sentence for possessing medical marijuana. Fogel's release 'serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,' Waltz said. Another American citizen was released Wednesday from a prison in Belarus, a close ally of Russia, according to State Department officials. Trump on the campaign trail pledged to end the war swiftly, criticizing then-president Joe Biden for failing to negotiate a resolution to a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. Trump's call with Putin, the first-known conversation between the presidents since Trump's return to the White House, comes just ahead of the war's third anniversary. Trump said he will call Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday 'to inform him of the conversation.' The president added that his discussion with Putin covered 'the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.' Zelensky met the same day with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Hamas forced hostage to stage her own death, smashed in captive’s...	Daniella Gilboa was forced to stage her own death for a propaganda film; a Thai hostage had his teeth smashed in. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The physical and mental torture that Hamas inflicted on the hostages included forcing one hostage to stage her own death and destroying the teeth of another. Daniella Gilboa had to lie still while covered with white powder and debris as a terrorist filmed her for a propaganda video that would falsely claim she was killed in an IDF airstrike in Gaza, her mother said Wednesday. Her captors came in with a camera and told her 'Today we are filming you dead,' which led her to believe that they were going to kill her, Orly Gilboa said. Terrified, she pleaded with them not to murder her. At the end, they used only a blurred picture of Gilboa’s supposed dead body to accompany a statement in November claiming that 'one of the enemy’s female prisoners was killed in an area that is under Zionist aggression in the northern Gaza Strip.' The picture immediately led to fears of her death because it showed a tattoo on the body just like one that Gilboa has. The fact that this preyed greatly on the young IDF observer’s mind could be surmised by the first thing she told her parents upon her release last month. 'When she saw me and my husband for the first time, she apologized for how she caused us to feel this whole time,' her mother said, even though the fault lay solely with Hamas. Last January, Hamas had forced Gilboa and two other hostages to speak on a video it released as a form of psychological warfare on Israel and the hostages' families. Channel 12 reported Wednesday that one of the five Thai workers that the terrorists released last week from Gaza had had his teeth smashed in by one of his captors, who slammed a rifle butt into his mouth. While he and his friends were beginning their recovery at the Shamir-Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, specialists in the oral and maxillofacial surgery department did extensive repair work on his mouth. Some of the freed Thai hostages also needed treatment for gunshot wounds, and all of them received initial psychological care as well. After spending ten days in the hospital, all five were flown back to their home country. Their physicians have prepared plans for follow-up care to be carried out in Thailand with Israeli funding. This includes continuing to pay for dental treatments for this man until his mouth and teeth are fully rehabilitated. The government has granted the Thais permanent residency rights in Israel in recognition of their horrific treatment at the hands of Israel’s enemies, and they will receive a monthly stipend of NIS9,000 shekels for the rest of their lives as victims of Arab terror. As freedom slowly reinvigorates the hostages Hamas has released in the last month, more stories of the terrorists’ cruelty appear almost every day.

Report: US okays ‘long-term’ IDF presence in Lebanon	Trump administration reportedly authorizes Israel to maintain a 'long-term' presence in key strategic areas in southern Lebanon, again pushing back the deadline for the full withdrawal of IDF forces. By World Israel News Staff The United States has granted Israel's request to maintain a military presence in parts of southern Lebanon beyond the current deadline for the IDF's withdrawal, according to a new report Wednesday night. Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, reported that the Trump administration has approved Jerusalem's request to a joint committee monitoring the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire for the IDF to maintain continued control of five strategically important positions in southern Lebanon near the Israeli border. According to the report, the U.S. has authorized Israel to keep a 'long-term' presence in the area, without specifying the duration of the IDF's stay. The report also claimed that the IDF has already begun building five army outposts to solidify its control over the positions in question, despite the U.S. previously rejecting Israel's request to modify the latest deadline for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. Even as the IDF is constructing the outposts, the report added, Israeli forces are pulling out of nearby Lebanese villages, in preparation for the return of nearly all of southern Lebanese territory by the February 18th deadline. Wednesday's report comes days after the Trump administration said that it expects Israel to adhere to the new deadline, which calls for the removal of all Israeli forces from Lebanon by February 18. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly spoke with President Donald Trump last week during his visit to Washington, urging the president to back Israel's request for an extension. The November deal originally imposed a 60-day deadline, requiring Israel to withdraw all of its forces from Lebanese territory by January 26th, in exchange for Hezbollah pulling its forces back to the northern bank of the Litani River, and the Lebanese military actively enforcing the ban on Hezbollah operations near the Israeli frontier. After Israel accused both Hezbollah and Beirut of living up to the agreement, however, the U.S. approved a delay in the implementation of the withdrawal, pushing the deadline back to February 18th.

Israel to strike Iran’s nuclear program in mid-2025, US predicts	American intelligence reportedly claims Jerusalem is poised to attack Iranian nuclear facilities in a preemptive strike sometime in the first half of 2025 - but believes attacks will only delay Iran's nuclear program by weeks or months. By World Israel News Staff Israel is planning to carry out a series of preemptive airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities in the coming months, American intelligence officials predict. According to a report published by The Washington Post early Thursday morning, a dossier produced by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense Intelligence Agency last month claims that Israel will likely carry out strikes on several Iranian nuclear facilities sometime during the first half of 2025. Specifically, the report claimed that the Israeli Air Force will probably strike at the nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz. Thursday's report, which cited American officials and former U.S. officials, said that the January dossier was based in part on an analysis of Israel's strikes on Iran's air defense network in October, following Iran's second major ballistic missile strike on the Jewish state. Israel and various American intel agencies, including the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Director of National Intelligence's office all declined to comment on the report. White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in response that the Trump administration 'will not permit Iran to get a nuclear weapon.' President Trump, Hughes continued, has said that 'while he prefers negotiating a resolution to American’s long-standing issues with the Iranian regime peacefully, he will not wait indefinitely if Iran isn’t willing to deal, and soon.' The January dossier laid out two possible scenarios, both of which could see the U.S. indirectly support Israeli airstrikes on Iran with either airborne refueling of Israeli warplanes, reconnaissance, or intelligence. The first scenario revolves around the use of long-range standoff weapons, likely aerial-launched ballistic missiles fired from Israeli fighter jets operating outside of Iranian airspace. The second and riskier option would involve Israeli warplanes penetrating deep into Iran's airspace to drop BLU-109 bunker buster bombs. Depending in part on the form Israel's airstrikes take and the degree to which they succeed, preemptive strikes would push back Iran's nuclear program by a matter of weeks or months, the U.S. intel dossier said. However, one former American official told the Post that Israel's assessment of the impact of potential airstrikes differs significantly with that of the U.S. intel community, with Israeli officials arguing that strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities could inflict catastrophic damage on Tehran's nuclear program. 'That was a difference between our intelligence and their assessment,' the official said.

Terror accomplice drove van with hostage-supporting symbol	Driver of van affixed sticker of yellow hostage ribbon to his vehicle, in order to stave off suspicion as he illegally transported Palestinians into Israel. By World Israel News Staff A suspect charged with transporting a terrorist had placed a sticker expressing solidarity with the hostages in Gaza on his vehicle, according to an indictment. Prosecutors published on Thursday excerpts from the indictment against Majed Barkan, a 20-year-old resident of eastern Jerusalem. Barkan transported Salah Yahya, a 19-year-old terrorist from Tulkarem who had infiltrated into Israel illegally, to Tel Aviv in January 2025. Barkan picked up Yahya from the Atarot industrial zone in Jerusalem, an area where residents of PA-controlled enclaves in Judea and Samaria often seek transportation into pre-1967 Israel. Once in Tel Aviv, Yahya carried out a frenzied stabbing attack in the city, severely wounding a man. He was then shot dead by an armed bystander. The authorities are charging that Barkan was aware Yahya 'was illegally present in Israel, and could endanger the security of Israeli citizens and even carry out an attack.' Images of Barkan's van included the indictment showed that he had placed a large yellow ribbon on the vehicle. The yellow ribbon is used in Israel to express support for the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and their families. It's likely that Barkan used the symbol in order to stave off potential suspicion of his vehicle, as he often transported Palestinians without legal permission to be in Israel. 'We take very seriously any involvement of Israeli citizens in transporting, employing, or harboring illegal residents, especially when it leads to terrorist attacks,' the Israel Police said in a statement. 'There will be zero tolerance for those who assist terrorists in their murderous activities, and we will take firm action against anyone who endangers public safety. We will continue to use all means at our disposal to arrest them and bring them to justice.'

Iran flying cash to Hezbollah via Beirut Airport – IDF warning	IDF spokesman said that Iran has successfully smuggled money, intended for re-arming Hezbollah, through the airport. By World Israel News Staff Iran is trying to rebuild its battered proxy group Hezbollah by flying millions of dollars to the terror organization through Beirut International Airport, a practice which the IDF has warned must stop immediately. In an unusual statement, the IDF's Arabic language spokesman Avichai Adaree wrote on X that the Israeli military will take steps to prevent the transfers from continuing. 'Iran's Quds Force and the terrorist organization Hezbollah have been exploiting Beirut International Airport through civilian flights in an attempt to smuggle funds intended for Hezbollah's armament, aiming to carry out attacks against the State of Israel,' Adaree wrote. 'The IDF remains in continuous communication with the monitors who are enforcing the ceasefire and regularly shares specific information to thwart these smuggling operations,' he continued. 'Despite ongoing efforts, our assessments indicate that some of these smuggling attempts have been successful.' Adaree stressed that the 'IDF will not allow Hezbollah to arm itself and will use all available means to enforce the ceasefire agreements and ensure the security of Israeli citizens.' The statement comes just days ahead of the the deadline for Israel to withdraw troops from southern Lebanon. A Trump administration official recently confirmed that Washington expects the IDF to leave the region by February 18th. However, reports have indicated that Israel is lobbying to extend that deadline. Displaced residents of northern Israel's border region, who were evacuated from their homes shortly after the October 7th, 2023 terror onslaught, have still been unable to return to their communities. The Israeli government set March 1st as the date for which displaced northerners are expected to return home, but that timeframe appears unlikely. Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avichai Stern recently posted a video showing several concrete slabs haphazardly placed at the border, ostensibly as a barrier against a Hezbollah invasion. Noting the fact that the barrier could be easily overcome, Stern said it 'really looks like we’ve learned nothing from October 7th.'

Organization warns Israelis against participating in anti-settler...	Theroux: 'I’m interested in ideologues and fundamentalists of all stripes &#8230;I wanted to see settler expansionism up close, and the human cost it entails.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Israeli Sovereignty Movement warned Israelis not to participate in or speak with Louis Theroux for his upcoming documentary, which is likely to put settlers in a negative light. Documentary film presenter Louis Theroux will return to Judea and Samaria for a show on the BBC called The Settlers. Fifteen years ago, Theroux made a documentary called The Ultra-Zionists, whose purpose was to look at the 'extreme end of the Israeli settler community in the West Bank.' According to Theroux, the purpose of returning is to observe settlers in the context of the Israel-Hamas war. 'Since then, those same extreme settlers are even more emboldened,' Theroux said, likely referring to the BBC statement that Theroux will reveal some settlers 'are already making plans to move into' the Gaza Strip. Working with the assumption that settlers are inherently extremists, Theroux said, 'I’m interested in ideologues and fundamentalists of all stripes. In going back to the West Bank, I wanted to see settler expansionism up close, and the human cost it entails.' 'It’s a story specific to a time, a place, and a region, but it’s also a universal insight into tribalism and the ways in which we can blind ourselves to the humanity of those around us.' The Israeli Sovereignty Movement, headed by Yehudit Katsover and Nadia Matar, is warning Israelis not to engage with or talk to Louis Theroux and his team because of the negative way Theroux has depicted settlers in the past. In a post, the organization called Theroux 'A very anti-Israel person' and 'very smart and experienced,' who travels the world and exposes anyone the left-wing labels as 'extreme.' They described Theroux's 2010 documentary as 'very, very negative.' In the warning, the organization characterizes Theroux as someone who presents himself as 'naive and even a bit stupid' and as someone who 'just wants to understand another perspective' to create a 'trap' in order to get 'the most extreme, stupid, or weird responses, or anything that can be edited that way.' The Israeli Sovereignty Movement warned Israelis not to speak to Theroux or any of his team, including Director Josh Baker, Senior Producer, Sara Obeidat, Producer Matan Cohen, and Production Manager Emily Wallace.

2024 deadliest year for journalists; media claims most killed by ...	In October, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that six Al Jazeera journalists were members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that more journalists were killed in 2024 than in any previous year since it began keeping records. The organization attributed most of these deaths to Israel's military. According to CPJ statistics, 124 journalists and media workers were killed while on the job, with 70% of the deaths linked to Israeli military actions. The year 2024 surpassed the previous record of 113 journalist deaths in 2007, when half of the fatalities resulted from coverage of the Iraq War. Outside of Gaza and Lebanon, journalists were also killed in Sudan (6), Pakistan (6), Mexico (5), Syria (4), Myanmar (3), Iraq (3), and Haiti (2). CPJ stated that these journalists were killed in connection with their work and asserted that 24 of them were deliberately targeted in 2024. The organization cited Al Jazeera, which claimed that the killing of journalists was part of a systematic campaign targeting the network’s reporters and their families. However, there have been multiple instances where journalists were found to be working alongside terrorists or were suspected of having direct ties to militant organizations. In June, the IDF released a statement asserting that freed hostages Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv had been held by journalist Abdallah Aljamal and his family at their home in a central Gaza camp. According to Euro-Med, Aljamal resided on the first floor of a multi-story building, while the IDF reported that the hostages were found on the third floor. In October, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that six Al Jazeera journalists were members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad—both designated as terrorist organizations—citing documents uncovered in Gaza. The IDF stated on X (formerly Twitter) that it had obtained documents and intelligence information revealing that the six journalists—Anas Jamal Mahmoud Al-Sharif, Alaa Abdul Aziz Muhammad Salama, Hossam Basel Abdul Karim Shabat, Ashraf Sami Ashour Saraj, Ismail Farid Muhammad Abu Omar, and Talal Mahmoud Abdul Rahman Aruki—were affiliated with Palestinian terrorist groups. The IDF argued that these revelations cast doubt on the credibility and impartiality of Al Jazeera’s reporting in Gaza. Additionally, according to Honest Reporting, journalists working for Reuters, AP, and other media outlets were present with Hamas terrorists during the October 7th massacres and encouraged others to take part. One such journalist, Ashraf Amra, who had been working for Reuters and AP, was recorded viewing and appearing to enjoy another photojournalist’s footage of an IDF soldier being lynched. In the footage, two journalists recall how they infiltrated Israel’s border and laugh as they describe how the soldier’s body was mutilated and brutalized even after his death.

Family of kidnapped IDF soldier Matan Angrest receives news he is...	Matan Angrest's mother Anat: 'We were informed that he was held there in harsh conditions because he is a soldier.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The family of captive IDF soldier Matan Angrest received news from released hostages that he is alive but being held in extremely harsh conditions. Matan's mother, Anat, told Channel 12 News, 'We were informed that he was held there in harsh conditions because he is a soldier.' Matan served in a tank unit and was captured by Hamas while fighting on October 7. The other IDF troops in his tank—Itai Chen, Daniel Peretz, and Tomer Leibovitz—were killed, and their bodies were taken to Gaza. At the time of his capture, Angrest suffered critical injuries, which have likely remained untreated during his captivity. Matan's father, Hagi, said, 'We received a sign of life from the returnees about our beloved son, Matan, which deeply moved us. It is time to bring him home as soon as possible, along with all the others. Return our Matan to us, along with the other hostages, without delay. Their conditions are difficult, and the time to bring them back is now.' Hagi added that his family was 'shocked' to see the emaciated condition of the hostages released last Saturday, saying the images reminded him of his grandmother, who survived Auschwitz. 'These pictures are the same as the pictures of my grandmother who was released from Auschwitz,' he said. He added, 'Hamas is responsible for this crime against humanity, but Prime Minister Netanyahu and the government are responsible for ending this hell—this Holocaust.' He urged Netanyahu to proceed with the second phase of the hostage deal. In July, the IDF discovered a recording of Angrest in Gaza and gave it to his parents. There are indications that Angrest’s remarks were scripted by Hamas terrorists. For instance, instead of using the word 'hostage,' he referred to himself as a 'prisoner.' In the recording, Angrest directly appeals to Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire deal to secure the release of the hostages. 'Netanyahu,' he says in the clip, 'you must, must do this exchange between the [Palestinian] prisoners in Israel and the prisoners here. I very much want to see my family and friends—it's very important.'

Houthi leader warns will attack again if Gaza truce breaks	The terrorist leader claimed that the U.S.-Israeli agenda aimed to seize Islamic holy sites, including Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. By JNS The Houthis in Yemen have threatened to renew attacks on Israel if the Gaza ceasefire collapses. Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Iranian-backed terror group, declared in a televised address on Tuesday that its forces are 'ready to respond immediately' if Israeli attacks on Gaza resume. He emphasized the importance of Arab and Islamic unity against U.S. policies and condemned any efforts to resettle Gazans, specifically criticizing President Donald Trump’s plans regarding the future of the war-torn coastal enclave.

The terrorist leader claimed that the U.S.-Israeli agenda aimed to seize Islamic holy sites, including Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. Trump has re-designated the rebel group that controls northern Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization. Following the Hamas-led massacre in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the group, which calls itself Ansar Allah, began firing hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel and at commercial ships in the Red Sea. The Israel Defense Forces is increasing troop reinforcements and mobilizing reservists in the Southern Command following Hamas’s announcement that it would delay releasing hostages. Unless Hamas returns Israeli hostages by noon on Saturday, Feb. 15, the ceasefire will expire and the IDF will resume fighting until it defeats the terrorist group totally, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. The statement by Netanyahu announcing the ultimatum followed remarks on Monday by Trump, who also named Feb. 15 at noon as the deadline after which 'all hell will break loose' unless Hamas frees all hostages.

He will also meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who will be key to President Donald Trump’s professed goal of ending the Russia-Ukraine war. By Ben Sales, JTA Vice President J.D. Vance will visit the site of the Dachau concentration camp on Thursday, the latest in a string of senior U.S. officials to travel to the former Nazi camp. Vance will visit Dachau before heading to the nearby Munich Security Conference, an elite national security gathering, multiple outlets reported on Tuesday. He wrote on social media that his visit to Europe is focusing on artificial intelligence policy. He will also meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who will be key to President Donald Trump’s professed goal of ending the Russia-Ukraine war. Vance is the latest vice president to visit Dachau, one of the first camps built by the Nazi regime. Joe Biden visited with his granddaughter in 2015, when he was serving as vice president, and has taken the trip with other children and grandchildren as well. Vice President Mike Pence visited Dachau in 2017. In 2023, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, went on a Jewish heritage tour of Poland, including a visit to Auschwitz.

Israel pushes to keep IDF in parts of southern Lebanon past US de...	Israel's military has reportedly submitted plans for its forces to remain in strategically important areas in southern Lebanon beyond the deadline set by the US. By World Israel News Staff Israel is requesting an additional extension on the deadline for the removal of its armed forces from southern Lebanon, two sources told Reuters on Wednesday. The Reuters report cited a Lebanese official and a foreign diplomat, both of whom said that the Israeli military has filed a request with the multinational committee appointed to oversee the ceasefire between Israel and the Hezbollah terrorist group in a bid to push back the deadline for completing the withdrawal of the IDF from southern Lebanon. According to the report Israel has requested it be allowed to maintain control over five strategically important positions in southern Lebanon until the end of the month. Under the ceasefire deal, which went into effect in late November after efforts by the Biden administration and Macron government to secure Israel's agreement, the IDF was to have withdrawn all of its forces from Lebanese territory by January 26th. However, citing Hezbollah violations of the ceasefire, and the failure of the Lebanese military to assume full control over the territory being vacated by Israeli forces, the Trump administration backed Israel's requests to extend the IDF's presence in Lebanon. On Monday, however, the Trump administration said that it expects Israel to adhere to the new deadline, which calls for the removal of all Israeli forces from Lebanon by February 18th. Israel's Channel 12 reported Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited the White House earlier this week, has asked President Donald Trump to back Israel's request to maintain control over critical positions in southern Lebanon beyond the February 18th deadline. Netanyahu was quoted as telling the president that Lebanon's military has thus far been unable to prevent Hezbollah from reestablishing control over southern Lebanon.

Under Biden, American universities raked in nearly $1 billion fro...	While universities are required to disclose those foreign donors to the federal government under Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the Biden administration broke the precedent with prior administrations by withholding the names of foreign donors to the public. By Alana Goodman, The Washington Free Beacon American universities raked in nearly a billion dollars in the past four years from mystery donors in offshore tax havens, according to records reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. While the universities listed the unnamed donations as coming from places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, the Free Beacon traced millions of dollars back to donors linked to China. The news comes as the Trump administration prepares to crack down on foreign influence on college campuses, following years of Biden administration policies that have shielded the names of foreign university donors from the public. Since 2021, U.S. universities reported receiving over $600 million from donors in Bermuda, $280 million from Guernsey, $25 million from the British Virgin Islands, $25 million from the Bahamas, $17.5 million from Cayman Islands, and $11 million from the island of Jersey, Department of Education records show. While universities are required to disclose those foreign donors to the federal government under Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the Biden administration broke precedent with prior administrations by withholding the names of foreign donors to the public. As a result, for the past four years, the Department of Education only released the names of the countries where each donation came from. Tax haven countries represented some of the largest sources of funding during that time, raising questions about transparency and where the actual money is coming from. In some cases, records reviewed by the Free Beacon show, it's coming from China. The University of Pennsylvania, for example, reported in June 2022 that it received $3 million from a donor in the Cayman Islands to support the 'Penn Wharton China center including research articles and case studies,' according to federal records. But state records from Pennsylvania—where schools are required to report the names of foreign donors—list the donor as E-House Enterprise Holdings, a Chinese real estate company with a listed address in Hong Kong. The company is led by Xin Zhou, a Chinese national who serves on Penn's Wharton Board of Advisors. State records also show that Penn received $1 million in 2023 from Qihui Holdings, a shareholder of Chinese shopping platform Meituan Dianping. Penn's federal disclosure lists the money as coming from a donor in the British Virgin Islands to support the 'Artificial Intelligence Program at the Wharton School.' Meituan Dianping's cofounder and former CEO, Tao Zhang, is a Chinese national who attended the Wharton School. Both Zhou and Zhang's past contributions to Penn have come under scrutiny. In 2020, the Free Beacon reported that a $3 million donation the school claimed was from Zhou actually came from a Hong Kong company owned by a Shanghai businessman with deep ties to Chinese government officials. Penn also sparked controversy for taking money from Zhang in 2022 after Fox News reported on his company’s involvement in party-building activities for the Chinese Communist Party and CCP-connected shareholders, including Tencent and Alibaba. The Pennsylvania records were obtained by watchdog group Americans for Public Trust and shared with the Free Beacon. The group's director, Caitlin Sutherland, called for a federal foreign funding reporting system that includes donors' names. 'The current system allows the individual sources of the foreign money to remain obscured from the public, which raises serious concerns when the donors hail from adversarial countries like China and Qatar,' said Sutherland. 'The American public deserves to know exactly who is buying influence in our higher education system.' In addition to Penn, state records show that Carnegie Mellon University received $100,000 through the Cayman Islands from the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute in August 2022. The donation does not appear to be listed in federal foreign donor records. Tianqiao Chen, a billionaire and reported member of the Chinese Communist Party, sparked outcry from Republican lawmakers last year after reporting revealed him to be the second-largest foreign farmland owner in the United States. Other university disclosures also raise questions about the true sources of donations from known tax havens. In 2023, Yale reported receiving a $79 million donation from the island of Guernsey to fund an 'institute to enhance the understanding of human cognition.' Yale’s Wu Tsai Institute, which focuses on the study of human cognition, is bankrolled by Joseph Tsai, the chairman of China’s Alibaba Group. Alibaba has extensive ties to the Chinese government, which owns stakes in a number of its business units. Although state records aren’t available to confirm that Tsai is the donor—Connecticut does not publish such records—the Joe and Clara Tsai Foundation is based in the island of Guernsey, according to corporate disclosures. Yale has reported receiving over $400 million from Guernsey since 2020. Yale faced an investigation under the first Trump administration in connection with donations from Tsai. The Department of Education accused the school of failing to disclose hundreds of millions in foreign grants, including $30 million from Tsai. Tsai is also a major donor to the China Center at the University of San Diego, a school that reported receiving $14 million from the island of Guernsey in 2022 and 2023. Penn, Carnegie Mellon, and Yale did not respond to requests for comment. Earlier this month, the American Enterprise Institute published a report noting that American universities have 'failed to report billions in foreign funding, which drove the first Trump administration to launch several investigations into Section 117 noncompliance.' The report noted that schools under investigation reported receiving nearly $900 million in funding from China. Mark Schneider, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told the Free Beacon that the Biden administration 'did almost nothing' to investigate whether schools were complying with the disclosure requirements. He expects this to change quickly under the Trump administration. Schneider said donors could use tax haven countries as a way of 'hiding the ultimate source of the money.' 'There’s a lot of suspicion of elite institutions,' said Schneider. 'They’re going to be under a lot of pressure and [face] a lot of investigations into their practices.'

US-funded condoms not sent to Gaza Strip, Musk admits	Trump's efficiency czar walks back claims that USAID was spending tens of millions of dollars on condoms for the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, after Gaza Province confused with Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Claims by the Trump administration that the United States federal government sent tens of millions of dollars-worth of condoms to the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip were incorrect, Elon Musk acknowledged during a press briefing Tuesday. On Tuesday, Musk, the billionaire tech mogul tapped by President Donald Trump to head the new Department of Government Efficiency, held an impromptu press briefing with reporters in the Oval Office Tuesday, defending his agency's work. When questioned over DOGE's claim last month that the USAID agency had spent $50 million dollars on condoms for the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip - despite push-back from reporters who said they found no evidence of any such transfer - Musk acknowledged that the initial claim was the result of a mistake. While USAID had in fact funded a program providing condoms to Gaza - to the tune of $50 million - the Gaza in question was not the Gaza Strip, but a province named Gaza in the African nation of Mozambique. 'We are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we'll also fix the mistakes very quickly,' Musk said, downplaying the issue. The DOGE administrator added that he is still critical of U.S. funding for the program. 'I'm not sure we should be sending $50 million worth of condoms anywhere, frankly.' 'If the condoms went to Mozambique instead of Gaza, then fine, it's not so bad, but still, why are we doing this? I'm not sure that's something the American people would be happy about. That's an enormous number of condoms.' After DOGE made its initial claim that USAID was funding the shipment of condoms to the Gaza Strip, President Trump claimed Hamas had 'turned [the] condoms into bombs,' citing the past use by Gaza terrorists of makeshift balloons for incendiary bombs against Israel.

Trump secures American’s release from Russian prison after Biden’...	Though Fogel began serving his sentence in June 2022, the Biden administration did not designate him as 'wrongfully detained' until late last year. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon President Donald Trump on Tuesday secured the release of an American teacher imprisoned in Russia since 2021, striking an exchange deal with the Kremlin after the Biden administration repeatedly failed to bring the man home. Marc Fogel, 63, was arrested at a Russian airport in August 2021 for possessing medical marijuana and sentenced to 14 years in prison. The history teacher from Pennsylvania is now 'leaving Russian airspace' and expected to be back on U.S. soil by Tuesday evening, according to White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Waltz said in a statement that Trump, along with Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and other advisers, 'negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine.' He did not say whether the United States released a prisoner in return. Former president Joe Biden's administration long claimed it was working to secure Fogel's release but failed to make progress, even as it struck deals to free other Americans held by Russia. Though Fogel began serving his sentence in June 2022, the Biden administration did not designate him as 'wrongfully detained' until late last year, despite multiple calls from lawmakers and Fogel's family. Fogel's lawyers and family had harsh words for Biden's handling of the case, with attorneys Martin De Luca and Andrew Smith thanking Trump and blasting the Biden team for 'bureaucratic inaction,' the New York Times reported. Fogel's mother told CBS News last year that 'I don't think the [Biden] administration has helped us one bit.' The Biden administration left Fogel out of a high-profile prisoner swap last summer. The deal, the largest swap since the Cold War, secured the release of 26 individuals, including 3 Americans. FREED PRISONER MARC FOGEL: 'PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A HERO!'

Hamas-linked lobbying network expands political influence in Euro...	LP4Q describes itself as an organization established 'at the initiative of parliamentarians who support Palestinian rights.' By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner A Turkey-based lobbying network with ties to the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas is working to recruit European politicians to support anti-Israel policies, according to a new investigative report. NGO Monitor, a Jerusalem-based research institute that tracks anti-Israel bias among nongovernmental organizations, published a report last week on the expansion of the League of Parliamentarians for Al-Quds and Palestine (LP4Q). This political lobby network, which was established in 2015 and includes about 1,500 parliamentarians from around the world, is growing its influence across several European countries. Vincent Chebat, senior researcher at NGO Monitor, authored the report, which exposes the dysfunction in the ways interest groups operate within European parliaments. He noted that the information about LP4Q’s connections to Hamas and the involvement of highly controversial European representatives in a lobby group backed by Turkey and Qatar was easily accessible. 'The lack of basic vetting is remarkable,' he told The Algemeiner. 'It is not surprising that far-left MPs, some belonging to parties that have repeatedly refused to recognize Hamas as a terrorist entity, were involved in establishing this network.' Since 2023, LP4Q members have met with current and former members of parliaments across Europe and activists in the European Parliament, Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, the UK, Ireland, Scotland, and Finland. The organization is also 'preparing to expand' its activities to Portugal, the Netherlands, and Eastern Europe. LP4Q describes itself as an organization established 'at the initiative of parliamentarians who support Palestinian rights.' Last year, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an outspoken supporter of Hamas and a fierce critic of Israel, said that 'the League of Parliamentarians for al-Quds has become the voice of the Palestinian issue at the global level.' Michele Piras, a former Italian member of parliament and current LP4Q board member, leads the group’s expansion in Europe and has reportedly engaged with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), an internationally designated terrorist organization that participated in Hamas’s invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, according to NGO Monitor. Last year, LP4Q’s European Network held its first meeting at the French National Assembly, bringing together 20 parliamentarians from several European countries to discuss, as they described, 'the pressing need for Europe to take decisive action to halt the ongoing genocide in Gaza.' The New Executive Board of the League of Parliamentarians for al-Quds and Palestine Holds its First Meeting (May 2024). Photo: NGO Monitor 'Participants advocated for measures such as the cessation of military cooperation with Israel, an arms embargo, an immediate ceasefire, and the provision of humanitarian aid to civilians,' LP4Q wrote in a statement. 'Additionally, support was voiced for pursuing legal avenues, including actions before the International Court of Justice, to ensure severe condemnation of Israeli crimes,' the statement continued. During the meeting, members also argued for 'the recognition of an independent Palestinian State … and the right to self-determination for the Palestinian people.' NGO Monitor reported that 160 current and former European parliamentarians signed a petition outlining their positions on the French communist website L’Humanité as part of the European Network’s launch. The signatories included 99 French, 23 Italian, 12 Belgian, and 14 Spanish MPs, senators, and MEPs (member of European Parliament). Until its expansion to Europe, LP4Q was originally composed of members of parliament from Muslim countries, with at least two of its board members linked to Hamas and having been sanctioned by the US government. For example, LP4Q President Hamid bin Abdullah Al-Ahmar, a Yemeni businessman, is considered one of Hamas’s most prominent international supporters, according to the US Treasury Department. He also played a key role in Hamas’s investment portfolio, which managed over $500 million worth of assets at its peak. In 2021, Al-Ahmar met now-deceased Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh to discuss 'the political developments related to the Palestinian issue, the dangers facing it, ways to confront them, and the required national, regional, and international work strategies, especially within the parliamentary framework represented by the Parliamentarians for Jerusalem Association.' Other LP4Q members and officials also have ties to Hamas. For example, board member Sayed Salem Abu-Msameh has been described as 'one of the founders of Hamas' and was reportedly sentenced by Israel to 12 years in prison for helping to establish the terrorist group’s military wing. LP4Q board vice presidents Hasan Turan, a Turkish member of parliament, and Ahmed Kharchi, an Algerian member of parliament, have also been linked to Hamas, with Turan reportedly facilitating high-level meetings between senior Hamas leaders and Turkish political elites. According to NGO Monitor, LP4Q already has influence in Muslim states, including Qatar, as well as in Africa and South America, through its observer membership in the Parliamentary Union of the OIC Member States (PUIC), the African Parliamentary Union (APU), the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption (GOPAC), and the Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union. As for LP4Q’s finances, NGO Monitor explained that the Turkey-based lobbying network is not transparent about its sources of funding, and the amounts related to its agreements remain undisclosed. In 2021, LP4Q signed a 'protocol cooperation' with a Turkish governmental institution, the Presidency for Turks Abroad and Related Communities. That same year, it agreed with the state-run news agency Anadolu 'to engage and coordinate in order to serve the Palestinian and the cause of Jerusalem in the media and to confront the disinformation and falsification campaigns of the Israeli media machine.' The Algemeiner reached out to LP4Q for comment for this story but did not receive a response.

Jared Kushner behind Gaza resettlement plan – report	The president’s son-in-law floated the idea of moving Gazans out in order to rebuild the coastal enclave a year ago. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Jared Kushner is reportedly the man behind the idea floated by President Donald Trump last week after meeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of rebuilding Gaza while moving its current residents to a safer and better life in other countries. Citing an anonymous source, subscription platform Puck News reported at the time that the president’s son-in-law and one of the architects of the Abraham Accords had helped prepare the statements Trump made at the subsequent press conference. His remarks included calling for permanently resettling Palestinians outside Gaza, saying that 'the U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip,' and that he sees it as 'a long-term ownership position' which he claimed would bring 'great stability' to the region. It could also turn Gaza one day into 'the Riviera of the Middle East,' he said, speaking as the billionaire real estate expert he is. While not providing a timeline as to what had occurred first, Axios reported Monday that Netanyahu had 'met last week' with Kushner in Washington and they talked about the president’s plan for Gaza Kushner is receiving credit now because although Trump’s idea caught almost everyone by surprise, he had already mentioned at least part of it a year ago. When speaking at a 'Middle East Initiative' forum at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government only four months into the Israel-Hamas war, Kushner said that he didn’t think there was much point for Palestinians to remain as he 'wasn’t sure there is much left of Gaza at this point.' 'From Israel’s perspective, I would do my best to move the people out and then clean it up,' he said, adding quickly that he didn’t think that Israel would want to remove the population permanently. The former real estate developer also said that 'Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable if people would focus on building up livelihoods.' Trump also questioned why anyone would want to stay in a place full of rubble and 'unexploded bombs.' He has also since doubled down on the idea that the Gazans should not necessarily have the right to return, although he has also said their new homes and lives would be so nice they would not want to come back. Kushner’s interlocutor at the forum, Prof. Tarek Masoud of the Kennedy School, clarified to CBS News after Tuesday’s bombshell that his guest had been speaking specifically about the Arabs in Rafah before the anti-Hamas IDF operation began in the southern town. Egypt had turned down the idea of letting Gazans into the Sinai to protect them from the upcoming battle, he said, and 'Kushner was proposing another option, which was to create a safe zone in the Negev desert, which is part of Israel, and he ended that discussion by saying that nobody was saying that the people of Gaza would not go back.' Netanyahu has praised Trump’s plan for Gaza, and his 'willingness to think outside the box' and 'puncture conventional thinking,' which he pointed out has not helped solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict even after decades of trying.

IDF ready to rapidly re-enter Gaza if ordered	The IDF continues to maintain a presence in southern Gaza’s Philadelphi Corridor on the border with Egypt, and it surrounds the Rafah Crossing. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS The Israel Defense Forces stands ready to redeploy throughout the Gaza Strip should the Cabinet give the order, according to military sources, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set an ultimatum for Hamas to release hostages by noon on Saturday. The timeline for such a redeployment would be very rapid, according to the sources, and the IDF’s presence in Gaza can be re-established in very little time, similar to the speed with which the Israeli military withdrew, military sources told JNS on Tuesday. The Netzarim Corridor On Monday, Army Radio reported that the IDF is preparing to return an additional division to the Gaza Strip, with the headquarters of the reservist 252nd Division re-mobilized to Gaza City. This division left the Netzarim Corridor that separates northern Gaza from the rest of the Strip in December. According to the report, IDF Southern Command has approving plans and battle procedures for possible return to combat. All leaves have been canceled for forces in the sector until further notice. The IDF also indicated that civilian safety guidelines in the border areas remain unchanged, though the situation is being reassessed. Currently, the IDF’s 162nd Division is holding the northern area of the buffer zone separating northern Gaza and Israel, and protecting the border communities in the western Negev. The Gaza Division remains in the southern part of the buffer zone, protecting the southern border communities. Col. (res.) Dr. Eran Lerman, vice president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies and former deputy director of the Israeli National Security Council, told JNS on Monday, 'The capabilities of Hamas to rebuild its civilian rule throughout the Strip have already materialized, because Israel did nothing to replace it in the last year.' On the other hand, he assessed, as long as Egypt does not turn into an overt enemy, Hamas 'will not significantly rebuild its military power, and it will be possible [for the IDF] to maneuver quickly and with full force based on everything learned this year.' On Monday, the IDF completed its withdrawal from the strategic Netzarim Corridor, as part of the first stage of the ceasefire and hostage release agreement with Hamas. The corridor became one of the symbols of Israeli military control by creating a buffer that split the Strip between its northern and southern parts, preventing free movement between them. In October 2024, when the IDF re-entered northern Gaza after an eight-month absence, it used checkpoints to screen civilians moving south and arrested more than a thousand terrorists. Since then, tens of thousands of Gazans returned to northern Gaza after the corridor was vacated, and it is likely that many terrorists returned with them. While vehicle traffic moving north in Gaza must pass through checkpoints staffed by a private U.S. security contractor, pedestrian traffic is unscreened. On Feb. 10, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit issued a statement through its Arabic-language spokesperson, Col. Avichay Adraee, announcing that the return of Gazan residents on foot to the northern Strip via Salah al-Din Street will be permitted. 'As for the movement of vehicles to the north of the Strip, it will continue subject to inspection via the Salah al-Din axis. We note that the movement of terrorists or the transfer of combat equipment through these corridors to the northern Gaza Strip is strictly prohibited and will be considered a breach of the agreement. We call on you to refrain from cooperating with any terrorist group seeking to exploit you in order to transfer combat equipment or prohibited materials.' The IDF continues to maintain a presence in southern Gaza’s Philadelphi Corridor on the border with Egypt, and surrounds the Rafah Crossing. In recent days, the IDF opened fire repeatedly throughout Gaza to warn suspects approaching Israeli forces or violating the restricted buffer zone, which runs deep into Gaza and runs along the entire Israel border. On Sunday, Palestinian sources said three people were killed by IDF fire after entering the buffer zone near Kibbutz Nahal Oz. IDF said that day the it operated to distance suspects who posed a threat to troops. The military added that it is 'prepared for any scenario and will continue to thwart any immediate threat.'

Rubio: ‘Don’t believe anything Hamas says’	It's not a stupid ceasefire,' says US Secretary of State, emphasizing Israel must not allow Hamas to rebuild itself during the Gaza truce, as Netanyahu warns of return to war if hostages not released on Saturday. By World Israel News Staff U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to back Israel's plans to resume the war in the Gaza Strip if the Hamas terror organization fails to release Israeli hostages this coming Saturday. During an interview Tuesday with NewsNation, Rubio said in response to Hamas claims Monday that Israel has abrogated the Gaza ceasefire by limiting aid into the Strip that 'you can't believe anything Hamas says.' Rubio reiterated President Donald Trump's demand that all of the remaining Israeli hostages be released on Saturday, and not merely the three slated for release as part of the pre-existing schedule. 'I think the President’s been very clear he wants to see those hostages come – be released. He’s tired of this drip, drip every week. There’s some Americans there as well. He wants to see them released, and he’s made very clear that if that’s not the case on Saturday, then then all bets are off. And it’s not going to be good for Hamas. But let’s hope that that resolves itself. ' Nevertheless, Rubio expressed hope the ceasefire remains in place, while acknowledging that it remains 'tenuous,' after Hamas announced it will delay the release of additional hostages. 'It’s always a tenuous ceasefire, because you’re dealing with a terrorist organization in Hamas,' Rubio continued. 'I don’t think anyone wants to see a resumption of hostilities. But by the same token, we can’t have Hamas deciding what parts of the deal they’re going to live up to and what parts they’re not.' The Secretary of State seemed to signal support for continued Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip should the ceasefire fail. 'Part of the challenge here is that Hamas&#8230; continues to use networks to smuggle in weaponry and aid for themselves to reconstitute themselves. Israel can’t allow that to happen.' 'You can’t allow them, Hamas, to use the ceasefire to sort of rebuild itself and recover strength. So it’s a ceasefire but it’s not a stupid ceasefire.'

‘West Bank annexation will work out very well,’ says Trump	President Trump refuses to guarantee Israel won't apply sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, says 'annexation will work out automatically.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump refused Tuesday to guarantee the U.S. would not back Israel's application of sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, saying during a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II that annexation would 'work out very well.' On Tuesday, the president hosted King Abdullah at the White House for their first meeting since Trump returned to office last month. Before the two spoke behind closed doors, Trump addressed questions posed by reporters, including one who asked whether the U.S. would guarantee that it will not permit Israel to extend sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. Trump, sitting next to King Abdullah, refused to offer any such guarantee, and instead appeared to indicate support for such a move by Israel. 'Many people in the region, especially in Jordan, are worried about the annexation of the West Bank,' the reporter said. 'Will you give His Majesty the King a guarantee that you won't allow Israel to annex the West Bank?' the reporter continued. While declining to delve into the subject, Trump offered no promise to oppose Israel's annexation of Judea and Samaria, instead saying the matter would resolve itself 'automatically.' 'I think that's going to work out very well. That's not really what we're talking about today. I think that's something that is going to work out automatically and it is in good shape.' 'And we discussed it,' Trump continued, nodding towards King Abdullah. 'Other people have discussed it with us and with me. And the West Bank is going to work out well.' Trump reiterated his demand that Hamas release all remaining Israeli hostages by this coming Saturday. 'I don't want to do two [hostages] and then we do another two and another week, and then we do 4 and 3 weeks. No, no. They either have them out by Saturday at 12:00 or all bets are off.'

‘Israel must seize Trump’s Gaza opportunity’ – Smotrich	Mr. Prime Minister, give the order' to resume fighting against Hamas and conquer the Gaza Strip, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said. By World Israel News Staff Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionism) called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seize the historic opportunity to resume the war in Gaza Strip and resettle its residents elsewhere, saying that doing so would also help recover Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. 'Mr. Prime Minister, I urge you, following such a moral, simple, and clear statement by President Trump, to inform Hamas unequivocally: either all the hostages are released by Saturday – no more phases, no more games, or the gates of hell will be opened on them,' Smotrich said in a video statement released on his social media channels. Smotrich said that Israel must immediately halt all humanitarian aid, electricity, fuel, and water to the Strip, in order to achieve a decisive victory over Hamas. In order to win the war and eliminate the security threat posed to Israel, Smotrich continued, Israel must launch a 'complete conquest' of the Gaza Strip, which would see 'all Gazans' expelled from the region. Officially annexing Gaza and assuming it as the only 'painful price' understood by Israel's enemies, he said. 'Mr. Prime Minister, this is the only way to keep our hostages alive and bring them home as quickly as possible. We have all the international backing on this matter. Give the order,' Smotrich added. Despite a green light from Trump to resume fighting against the Hamas terror group if it does not release the some 70 remaining Israeli hostages by Saturday, it's unclear whether Israel intends to leverage the opportnity provided by the U.S. president. Various Israeli government officials have released conflicting statements to Hebrew-language media regarding Israel's official stance on Trump's statement. Some media outlets quoted ministers as saying that Israel would hold Hamas to Trump's deadline, while others said that it was demanding Hamas release just nine hostages originally scheduled to be freed in the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to publicly confirm that he endorses Trump's demand that all of the hostages be released by the end of the week.

Preparing for war? Hamas bans phone use among leadership	Fearing Israeli assassinations, Hamas' senior political and military leadership ditch phones to avoid being tracked, go into hiding. By World Israel News Staff Hamas has ordered a ban on the use of mobile phones by senior leadership, within both its military and politburo divisions, suggesting that the terror group is preparing for the collapse of the ceasefire and a return to fighting against Israel. Sources from Hamas told Arabic-language news outlet Asharq Al-Awsat that the terror group's leaders and its intelligence unit issued a directive to all commanders to stop using their phones, in order to prevent being tracked by Israel, and immediately go into hiding. Many of Hamas' senior leadership had resumed using their phones during the ceasefire, according to the report. The terror group is particularly concerned about surprise assassinations via Israeli airstrikes, especially as reconnaissance aircraft carrying missiles have returned to the skies over several areas of the Gaza Strip, Asharq Al-Awsat reported. Earlier this week, Hamas said that it would delay the release of Israeli captives until further notice, a direct violation of the ceasefire and hostage deal. The group claimed that Israel had not fulfilled its obligations under the agreement regarding the amount of humanitarian aid entering the Strip - a charge that Israel vehemently denies. According to Hamas sources, the terror group is gearing up for a number of scenarios, including a resumption of the war. Hamas is preparing for Israel to retake control of the Netzarim Corridor, a strategic passage dividing northern Gaza from the south, from which Israel withdrew earlier this week. The terror group believes that Israel may also redeploy and bolster troop forces to establish buffer zones, expected to be about half a kilometer into Gazan territory from the border fence with Israel. Following threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, it's unclear whether Hamas intends to stand by its earlier pledge to not release Israeli hostages this Saturday. 'Hamas is committed to the ceasefire agreement that [Israel] also committed to,' a Hamas spokesman said in a media statement on Tuesday night. 'We affirm that [Israel] is the party that did not abide by its commitments and is responsible for any complications or delays.' The post Preparing for war?

‘No famine in Gaza, Strip flooded with aid’ – Israeli official	The amount of food that enters Gaza every day is enormous,' Israeli official says, stressing that shortages are created by Hamas hoarding aid. By World Israel News Staff There is no 'famine' in the Gaza Strip, as trucks loaded with 'enormous' amounts of food and other humanitarian aid enter the coastal enclave every day, an Israeli official confirmed to Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv on Tuesday. The Hamas terror group and international media reports have promoted the narrative that Gazans are suffering from a lack of food during the ongoing conflict, sparking international investigations into Israel's prosecution of the war. But the sheer amount of aid trucks, carrying food, fuel, medical supplies, and more proves that the only shortages in the Strip are created by Hamas' hoarding of aid, an Israeli official responsible for aid distribution said. 'There is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza,' the official told Ma'ariv, adding that some 400 trucks enter the Strip on a daily basis. These aid convoys include trucks loaded with tents, diesel, fuel, and food products, the official continued. The official stressed that there is 'no shortage of any humanitarian materials inside Gaza,' with some of the trucks carrying 'blankets and warm clothes to the residents of the Strip.' The source added that trucks 'loaded with medical equipment through the Jordan River crossing.' Another official told Ma'ariv that 'the amount of food that enters Gaza every day is enormous.' They emphasized that 'there is no hunger there, and there are no problems deriving from food shortages.' The official acknowledged that Hamas terrorists regularly seize humanitarian aid, preventing goods from reaching civilians and oftentimes selling the goods for exorbitant prices on the black market. 'Hamas manages the distribution of aid within Gaza,' the official said. 'It has specific groups within the population that are given higher priority and favoritism, but we are not responsible for what goes on once the aid is in the Strip.' In recent months, some watchdog groups have quietly walked back their claims that the Gazans are starving. Video circulating on social media of Gazans, particularly footage of them gathering to watch the releases of Israeli hostages, has failed to show mass starvation of the population.

Which captives have not yet been freed in first phase of hostage ...	The list of 17 includes five older men, nine men under 50, a mother and two children. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As Hamas threatens cessation of the release of Israeli captives and Israel issues an ultimatum to restart the war if they are not freed, there are still 17 hostages slated for release in Phase One of the agreement. A total of 33 hostages were meant to be released in Phase One of the hostage deal, and 16 have already returned home, leaving 76 captives remaining in Gaza. Those scheduled for release in the first phase of the deal are in the 'humanitarian' category, including women, children, the elderly, and ill hostages. Of the 33, eight of them are reported to have died, with no indication of their identities. The emaciated appearance of Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy, and Eli Sharabi, who were released last Saturday, has led many to call for the urgent release of all the hostages. Former US President Donald Trump declared that if all hostages are not released by Saturday, 'all hell would break loose.' Following Trump's announcement, Netanyahu declared that the war would resume if the hostages are not freed by the Saturday deadline. The 17 hostages slated for release at the end of Phase One are: Itzik Elgarat, Shlomo Mantzur, Ohad Yahalom, Oded Lifshitz, Tsahi Idan, Hisham al-Sayed, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, Omer Wenkert, Sasha Trufanov, Eliza Cohen, Aver Mengistu, Tal Shoham, Omer Shem-Tov, Shiri Bibas, Ariel Bibas and Kfir Bibas. On Tuesday, Shlomo Mantzur, aged 86, was reported to have been killed in captivity. The list of 17 includes five older men, nine men under 50, a mother and two children. The Bibas mother and children were supposed to have been released earlier in the hostage release deal; the father, Yarden Bibas, has already been freed. Israel has asked Hamas for clarification on the status of the Bibas family, but Hamas has not provided information, and the IDF spokesman expressed 'grave concern' about their fate.

The 17 hostages slated for release at the end of Phase One are: Itzik Elgarat, Shlomo Mantzur, Ohad Yahalom, Oded Lifshitz, Tsahi Idan, Hisham al-Sayed, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, Omer Wenkert, Sasha Trufanov, Eliza Cohen, Aver Mengistu, Tal Shoham, Omer Shem-Tov, Shiri Bibas, Ariel Bibas and Kfir Bibas. On Tuesday, Shlomo Mantzur, aged 86, was reported to have been killed in captivity. The list of 17 includes five older men, nine men under 50, a mother and two children. The Bibas mother and children were supposed to have been released earlier in the hostage release deal; the father, Yarden Bibas, has already been freed. Israel has asked Hamas for clarification on the status of the Bibas family, but Hamas has not provided information, and the IDF spokesman expressed 'grave concern' about their fate.

Trump to Jordan’s King Abdullah: ‘We will take Gaza’	King Abdullah said Jordan would not take in additional Gazans and would do what was in the best interests of his country. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan on Tuesday, the President Donald Trump said that the US would take control of Gaza. He explained, 'Palestinians will live safely in another location that is not Gaza,' adding that the US would 'run it very properly.' Trump said that Gaza would come under US authority but that he would not personally be involved in its development. The president also predicted that Hamas would not meet the Saturday deadline to release all of the hostages and added, 'If this happens, 'all bets are off.'' When Trump suggested there must be areas in Jordan and Egypt where Gazan civilians could go, King Abdullah responded that although he was willing to take in 2,000 sick Gazan children, his focus would be on what is most beneficial to Jordan. Trump reminded the king that the US provides significant aid to Egypt and Jordan. Although King Abdullah posted on Twitter that his meeting with Trump was 'constructive,' he 'reiterated Jordan's steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.' He stated that a two-state solution is 'the way to ensure regional stability,' adding, 'This requires US leadership.' He also called President Trump 'a man of peace' and praised him for being instrumental in securing the Gaza ceasefire.

3 million Israelis battle war-related mental trauma, anxiety, and...	The comptroller’s report also criticized the government’s guidelines on who can be legally recognized for support under Israel’s Victims of Hostilities Compensation Law. By Sveta Listratov, TPS An estimated three million Israelis are suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome, depression and anxiety after more than a year of war, but the nation’s mental health system is not adequately meeting public needs, according to a State Comptroller report released on Tuesday. 'It is inconceivable that people have to wait half a year to see a psychiatrist,' said State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman, adding that he had warned the government of these failures a month after the attack, but the necessary reforms have not yet been fully implemented. The comptroller, also known as the state ombudsman, periodically releases reports auditing Israeli preparedness and the effectiveness of government policies. The report highlighted systemic failures in providing psychological support to survivors, evacuees and first responders, and estimated that three million people are not receiving proper care. According to the report, Israel’s mental health infrastructure, which was already struggling before October 7, 'failed to provide necessary treatment.' The report found that 90% of those experiencing PTSD symptoms have not sought treatment, many citing long wait times as the main barrier. Even among those who tried, the average waiting period for treatment is 6.5 months. Eiyar Segal, a clinical social worker specializing in trauma, emergency situations, and resilience training, told The Press Service of Israel that a major shift in treatment methods is required to address the overwhelming demand. Segal spent 20 years as a mental health officer in the Israel Defense Forces. 'We need to move away from an over-reliance on individual therapy and prioritize group therapy, which has proven to be both effective and resource-efficient,' she told TPS-IL. According to her, group therapy can treat 12 patients in the same time it takes to treat one person individually, allowing for a wider reach. Key factors that help individuals recover from emergency trauma include strong social connections and a sense of purpose. 'People who actively engage with their communities, whether by volunteering, joining support groups, or maintaining close relationships, tend to cope better,' she told TPS-IL. Segal also stressed the importance of structured routines and physical activity to help restore a sense of normalcy and control. Overconsumption of distressing news and excessive exposure to traumatic content can worsen anxiety and prolong the stress response, she noted. The comptroller’s report also criticized the government’s guidelines on who can be legally recognized for support under Israel’s Victims of Hostilities Compensation Law. In particular, first responders and volunteers — who evacuated victims under fire and then spent weeks recovering hundreds of mutilated bodies — were left without government support for their own mental health care. For example, the report found that only 1% of ZAKA volunteers from Tel Aviv and 13% from ZAKA Israel received psychological support. Despite existing emergency scenarios predicting mass evacuations, the comptrollers’ report said the Ministry of Health was unprepared to handle the psychological fallout. Services were initially staffed by volunteers with no official oversight, and many evacuees received no structured treatment. 'Building community support networks and integrating mental health education into daily life is crucial,' Segal told TPS-IL. 'We cannot wait for another crisis—we need to proactively strengthen mental health services across the country.' Mental health preparedness should not be an afterthought but a fundamental part of national security and community resilience, she insisted. 'Trauma doesn’t just disappear with time—it requires structured intervention. Investing in mental health today means a stronger, more resilient society tomorrow.' Said Englman, 'The State of Israel has a moral obligation to care for trauma victims. The government must ensure long-term funding and reform mental health services to prevent a national crisis.'

Netanyahu: Ceasefire ends unless hostages are freed on Saturday	He has ordered the IDF to amass forces in and around the Gaza Strip 'in light of Hamas’s statement about its decision to violate the [ceasefire] agreement,' Netanyahu said. By JNS Unless Hamas returns Israeli hostages by noon on Saturday, Feb. 15, the ceasefire will expire and the Israel Defense Forces will resume fighting until it defeats Hamas totally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. The statement by Netanyahu announcing the ultimatum followed remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, who also named Saturday, Feb. 15 at noon as the time after which 'all hell will break loose' unless Hamas frees all hostages. Netanyahu addressed Trump’s demand and credited him for his 'revolutionary vision for the future of Gaza, which we all welcomed,' he said, referencing the security cabinet. Netanyahu’s ultimatum followed an 'in-depth, four-hour discussion' by the cabinet, he wrote. 'We all expressed outrage at the shocking state of our three hostages who were freed last Saturday. We all also welcomed President Trump’s demand for the release of our hostages by noon on Saturday,' the prime minister wrote. He has ordered the IDF to amass forces in and around the Gaza Strip 'in light of Hamas’s statement about its decision to violate the [ceasefire] agreement,' Netanyahu said. This action is being carried out and would be completed shortly, he added. 'Unless Hamas returns our hostages by noon on Saturday, the ceasefire will end and the IDF will resume intensive fighting until Hamas is totally defeated,' his statement concluded. אם חמאס לא יחזיר את חטופינו עד שבת בצהריים - הפסקת האש תיפסק, וצה'ל יחזור ללחימה עצימה עד להכרעה סופית של החמאס pic.twitter.com/4Cx30kHGvN — Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) February 11, 2025 The post Netanyahu: Ceasefire ends unless hostages are freed on Saturday appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/netanyahu-ceasefire-ends-unless-hostages-are-freed-on-saturday/	2025-02-11T09:46:34-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/F241027MISPOOL14-scaled.jpg
Idan Amedi not returning for Season 5 of hit show ‘Fauda’	Amedi, 36, was wounded in January last year in an explosion in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, which killed six soldiers and injured several others. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Israeli actor and musician Idan Amedi will not reprise his role as undercover operative Sagi Tzur in the upcoming fifth season of Fauda. Amedi, who was seriously injured while serving in Gaza and is undergoing a long rehabilitation process, informed the show’s producers that he would be unable to participate in the new season. 'The filming schedule conflicted with Amedi’s planned international tour, making it impossible for him to participate in the new season' explained a statement to The Press Service of Israel from the public relations office of Sari Israeli, which represents the actor-musician. Amedi is scheduled to perform in Jerusalem on February 19, his birthday. Amedi, 36, was wounded in January last year in an explosion in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, which killed six soldiers and injured several others. He was hospitalized for over two weeks at Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan. Despite the injury, he has announced a return to the stage, with performances scheduled to begin this month. Upon his release from the hospital in January last year, when asked how his rehabilitation would impact the filming of Fauda, which was already known to be renewed for its fifth season, Amedi said, 'The creators are already working to adapt the script to our current reality. I will be back in the series with God’s help next season.' Now it is confirmed that the show’s creators will have to find a way to write out his character, Sagi Tzur, in the upcoming season. Amedi, who joined Fauda in 2017, is also a well-known singer-songwriter. His debut song, 'A Warrior’s Pain,' became one of Israel’s most iconic songs in 2010. Last month, he released Superman, his first album since being wounded, which was met with great success. Over the years, he has released six albums, blending themes of military service, resilience, and Israeli identity.

Gulf of Mexico becomes Gulf of America on US Google Maps	For most Americans who have an updated version of Google Maps, they should only see 'Gulf of America.' Mexican users should only see 'Gulf of Mexico,' while international users see both names. By Jewish Breaking News For centuries, the waters between the United States and Mexico have been known by a single name. That changed Monday when Google Maps users in the United States opened their apps to find a new label on their screens. The change stems from one of numerous executive orders signed on inauguration day by President Donald Trump as part of a broader executive push to 'restore American pride in the history of American greatness.' He also revoked an Obama-era decision to officially recognize Denali by reverting it back to Mount McKinley. For Google users, geography now depends on location. For most Americans who have an updated version of Google Maps, they should only see 'Gulf of America.' Mexican users should only see 'Gulf of Mexico,' while international users see both names. The move was expected after the tech giant announced in January that it would implement the change once the United States Geographic Names Information System was updated. However, not all tech companies have fallen in line, as Apple Maps still displays the Gulf of Mexico. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum isn’t letting the change go unchallenged. Last month, the Jewish president announced that she will be preparing a formal letter to Google questioning their decision to alter a name that has identified these waters since the 16th century. 'For us it is still the Gulf of Mexico, and for the entire world it is still the Gulf of Mexico,' Sheinbaum said. 'By the way, we are also going to ask for Mexican America to appear on the map.' But Google so far is standing by the change, pointing to existing policies that adjust map labels based on users’ locations such as operating system settings, SIM cards, and network connections.

Report: Egypt’s president snubs Trump ahead of planned meeting	El-Sisi reportedly suspends planned meeting with Trump as Cairo threatens to nix peace treaty with Israel if US cuts aid over Egypt's refusal to take in Gazans. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is reportedly refusing to meet with President Donald Trump, over Trump's plan to relocate the Gaza Strip's entire population to third-party countries, including Egypt. On Tuesday, Al Araby al-Jadeen cited multiple diplomatic sources claiming that el-Sisi has suspended plans to meet with his American counterpart, Donald Trump, amid the continuing disagreement between the two leaders over Trump's Gaza plan, which was first unveiled last week. Two Egyptian security officials told Reuters Wednesday that el-Sisi will not visit the White House if the mass relocation of Gazans is on the agenda. In addition, Al Araby al-Jadeen reported that Egypt is threatening to end the decades-old peace treaty with Israel if the Trump administration terminates American aid to Egypt over Cairo's opposition to the Gaza resettlement plan. On February 1, Trump spoke with el-Sisi by phone, the White House said, making no mention of the U.S. president's Gaza plan, though a readout of the call said they discussed the Gaza Strip. This past Sunday, Israeli President Isaac Herzog revealed that Trump is slated to meet with a number of senior Arab leaders, including Jordan's King Abdullah II, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, and el-Sisi. All three have publicly rejected Trump's plan to resettle Gaza's population in third-party countries. On Monday, Trump said he may halt American aid to Cairo and Amman if Egypt and Jordan refuse to take in Gaza refugees. The U.S. gives Egypt an estimated $2.1 billion annually, and $1.4 billion to Jordan. In response, diplomatic sources told Al Araby al-Jadeen, Egypt is mulling terminating the 1979 peace treaty with Israel, signed after Prime Minister Menachem Begin agreed to hand over the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. 'Egypt has decided to take precautions against any potential halt of U.S. aid and has prepared emergency plans to deal with U.S. pressure regarding the displacement issue,' sources cited by Tuesday's report claimed.

Hostage’s niece calls to halt Gaza aid if Hamas delays hostage re...	Yael Savariego’s demand echoes that of former internal security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Yael Savariego, niece of Hamas hostage Lior Rudaeff, demanded Tuesday that all humanitarian aid to Hamas be stopped if the terrorists fulfill their threat not to continue with the hostage deal. 'If Hamas indeed does not honor the agreement and we do not see hostages returning home on Saturday, we call on the Prime Minister, the Israeli government, the Cabinet members, and all decision-makers: immediately stop the aid to the enemy. Immediately stop the aid trucks to the Gaza Strip, do everything to resume the negotiations on this deal, and bring about the release of all the hostages, bar none,' said Savariego. Since her uncle was murdered while defending his kibbutz, Nir Yitzhak, from the Hamas-led invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023, the psychotherapist has been one of the leading voices of Tzav 9, a group that believed from the start that no humanitarian aid should enter Gaza unless the hostages are released first. Her call echoed that of former internal security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, whose party left the government in protest over the dangers of the current deal, reacted to Hamas’ announcement by urging a full-scale assault on Gaza 'from the air and the ground,' and later submitting a bill to the Knesset that would halt all aid deliveries. The explanatory portion of the proposed law recalled that 'At the start of the war, the State of Israel halted all humanitarian aid, severely impacting [Hamas] and leading to the first hostage exchange deal' in which 'eighty hostages were released' in exchange for a temporary ceasefire, the release of Palestinian prisoners, fuel and aid. Although Hamas broke the deal and the war resumed, humanitarian aid has continued to flow 'that in effect, gives the terrorist organization 'oxygen' to continue controlling the area, reorganizing again and again, and above all, surviving.' 'Everyone understands,' the bill concluded, 'that stopping humanitarian aid and conditioning it upon the release of all hostages is the only pressure mechanism that will compel Hamas to act.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, whose Religious Zionism party remained in the government while saying that to ensure its long-term security Israel cannot agree to Hamas’ demand to fully withdraw from Gaza, which was included in the next phase of the deal, was of similar mind. He told a faction meeting Monday that the only way to return the abductees is for people to take their anger about the hostages’ plight and 'take it out on the murderers in Hamas,' but with a change in tactics instead of 'doing more of the same.' 'We need to completely stop the transfer of humanitarian aid to Hamas,' he said. 'Permanently occupy territory as a response to the terrible massacre and to prevent the next massacre.' 'Of course,' he added, 'we should also take determined action to &#8230; encourage the migration of Gaza residents in cooperation with President Trump, who understands well the root of the conflict and the only realistic solution. Only in this way can we truly do everything, everything, to release all the hostages and destroy the Hamas threat.'

USAID provided assistance to Al Qaeda, Hezbollah terrorists – rep...	The agency targeted by the Trump administration reportedly funded a future senior Al Qaeda recruiter’s college tuition and sent supplies to Hezbollah. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News As more and more cases of fraud and corruption are exposed at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), two more cases of its support of Muslim terrorists have come to light. The New York Post reported Tuesday that an Israeli soldier had found boxes marked 'USAID' among a cache of sniper rifles, anti-tank missiles and explosives in a village in southern Lebanon. Asher Fredman, who in civilian life is the executive director of the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, told the daily that he had found the items in a village set up to be a 'forward base' for Hezbollah in its plans to invade Israel. NGOMonitor founder Gerald Steinberg said last week that 'The folks at USAID knew that taxpayers’ money and ‘emergency assistance’ went to terrorists.' In just one example of many, according to a source in the Washington Free Beacon, less than a week before Hamas’ Oct. 7 invasion of Israel, USAID handed $900,000 'to a terror charity in Gaza involved with the son of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.' In the second reported case, USAID assisted a future senior Al Qaeda member due to improper vetting. Fox News reported Monday on documents that have been found showing that the agency approved the request of one Anwar al-Aulaqi to fully fund his college studies in Colorado in 1990 without checking his bona fides. He claimed that he had been born in Yemen and wanted to study civil engineering as an exchange student when in reality he was born in the United States and was thus ineligible for such aid. He soon became an imam, preaching in several U.S. mosques, and serving as vice president of a charity that U.S. authorities said was a front to fund Al Qaeda. While in San Diego he also reportedly became close with two of the 9/11 hijackers, but was never charged in context with the movement’s attacks on the Twin Towers and Pentagon in 2001 although he was interrogated several times. When his fraud of USAID was discovered in 2002 he was tipped off that the authorities were investigating, and he fled, reaching Yemen in 2004, where he officially joined Al Qaeda and rose higher and higher in its ranks. His main role with the terrorists was as a senior recruiter, radicalizing many English-speaking, young Muslims, teaching them about jihad through popular motivational online videos and writings. He also was in close contact with two men who eventually carried out terrorist attacks in 2009. One was Major Nidal Hasan, who murdered 13 soldiers and injured more than 30 in a shooting in Fort Hood, Texas. The other was Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian who attempted to blow up a Detroit-bound plane on Christmas Day by detonating plastic explosives hidden in his underwear. Al-Aulaqi was eventually killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, ordered by then-president Barack Obama, who called it a 'significant milestone in the broader effort to defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates.' President Donald Trump is intent on closing down USAID, firing more than 90% of its staff, and putting its humanitarian functions within the purview of the State Department.

Israeli minister: Trump backs Israel annexing 5% of Gaza for ever...	Senior Israeli minister says Israel must issue its own ultimatum to Hamas and threaten to annex parts of the Gaza Strip every time a hostage is harmed, claiming Trump fully backs such a move. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior Israeli government minister has proposed Israel take punitive steps against the Hamas terror organization, including the incremental annexation of the Gaza Strip in response to the harming of Israeli hostages. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) put forth a plan Tuesday for pressuring Hamas into returning Israeli hostages, after the terror group announced Monday that was suspending the scheduled release of Israeli hostages, slated for this coming Saturday. Speaking at a conference on the integration of the ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) population, Smotrich laid out his plan to pressure Hamas. 'We need to set an ultimatum for Hamas,' Smotrich said, a day after Trump issued his own ultimatum, demanding the terror group release all Israeli hostages still in captivity by Saturday at noon. 'Cut off their electricity and water and stop the humanitarian aid,' Smotrich said. 'We must open the gates of hell.' The minister further proposed that for every hostage harmed in captivity, Israel will annex 5% of the Gaza Strip - a position he claimed has the backing of President Donald Trump. 'For each hostage that something&#8230;happens to, on that same day, we will annex 5% of the Gaza Strip. We have the full backing of President Trump.' In addition, Smotrich called on the IDF to actively search out and arrest every Palestinian terrorist freed as part of the deal with Hamas. 'We need to notify Hamas the moment we return to war, we need to rearrest all the terrorists whom we released.' 'In Gaza, there will be no Hamas, there will be no enemies, and there will be no threat to Israel. It will again be part of the State of Israel, since it is our land and that is the only way to ensure the security of the State of Israel.'

Some Israeli soldiers traveling abroad are targeted for alleged w...	The director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, Eden Bar-Tal, last month said fewer than a dozen soldiers had been targeted, and he dismissed the attempted arrests as a futile public relations stunt by 'terrorist organizations.' By The Associated Press An Israeli army reservist's dream vacation in Brazil ended abruptly last month over an accusation that he committed war crimes in the Gaza Strip. Yuval Vagdani woke up on Jan. 4 to a flurry of missed calls from family members and Israel's Foreign Ministry with an urgent warning: A pro-Palestinian legal group had convinced a federal judge in Brazil to open a war crimes investigation for his alleged participation in the demolition of civilian homes in Gaza. A frightened Vagdani fled the country on a commercial flight the next day to avoid the grip of a powerful legal concept called 'universal jurisdiction,' which allows governments to prosecute people for the most serious crimes regardless of where they are allegedly committed. Vagdani, a survivor of Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack on an Israeli music festival, told an Israeli radio station the accusation felt like 'a bullet in the heart.' The case against Vagdani was brought by the Hind Rajab Foundation, a legal group based in Belgium named after a young girl who Palestinians claim was killed early in the war by Israeli fire as she and her family fled Gaza City. Aided by geolocation data, the group built its case around Vagdani's own social media posts. A photograph showed him in uniform in Gaza, where he served in an infantry unit; a video showed a large explosion of buildings in Gaza during which soldiers can be heard cheering. Judges at the International Criminal Court concluded last year there was enough evidence to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for crimes against humanity for using 'starvation as a method of warfare' and for intentionally targeting civilians. Both Israel and Netanyahu have vehemently denied the accusations. Since forming last year, Hind Rajab has made dozens of complaints in more than 10 countries to arrest both low-level and high-ranking Israeli soldiers. Its campaign has yet to yield any arrests. However, it has led Israel to tighten restrictions on social media usage among military personnel. 'It’s our responsibility, as far as we are concerned, to bring the cases,' Haroon Raza, a co-founder of Hind Rajab, said from his office in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It is then up to authorities in each country — or the International Criminal Court — to pursue them, he added. The director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, Eden Bar-Tal, last month said fewer than a dozen soldiers had been targeted, and he dismissed the attempted arrests as a futile public relations stunt by 'terrorist organizations.' Universal jurisdiction is not new. The 1949 Geneva Conventions — the post Second World War treaty regulating military conduct — specify that all signatories must prosecute war criminals or hand them over to a country that will. In 1999, the United Nations Security Council asked all U.N. countries to include universal jurisdiction in their legal codes, and around 160 countries have adopted them in some form. 'Certain crimes like war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity are crimes under international law,' said Marieke de Hoon, an international law expert at the University of Amsterdam. 'And we’ve recognized in international law that any state has jurisdiction over those egregious crimes.' Israel used the concept to prosecute Adolf Eichmann, an architect of the Holocaust. Mossad agents caught him in Argentina in 1960 and brought him to Israel where he was sentenced to death by hanging. More recently, a former Syrian secret police officer was convicted in 2022 by a German court of crimes against humanity a decade earlier for overseeing the abuse of detainees at a jail. Later that year, an Iranian citizen was convicted by a Swedish court of war crimes during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. In 2023, 16 people were convicted of war crimes through universal jurisdiction, according to TRIAL International, a Swiss organization that tracks proceedings. Those convictions were related to crimes committed in Syria, Rwanda, Iran and other countries. In response to Brazil's pursuit of Vagdani, the Israeli military has prohibited soldiers below a certain rank from being named in news articles and requires their faces to be obscured. It has also warned soldiers against social media posts related to their military service or travel plans. The evidence Hind Rajab lawyers presented to the judge in Brazil came mostly from Vagdani’s social media accounts. 'That's what they saw and that's why they want me for their investigation,' he told the Israeli radio station Kan. 'From one house explosion they made 500 pages. They thought I murdered thousands of children.' Vagdani does not appear in the video and he did not say whether he had carried out the explosion himself, telling the station he had come into Gaza for 'maneuvers' and 'was in the battles of my life.' Social media has made it easier in recent years for legal groups to gather evidence. For example, several Islamic State terrorists have been convicted of crimes committed in Syria by courts in various European countries, where lawyers relied on videos posted online, according to de Hoon. The power of universal jurisdiction has limits. In the Netherlands, where Hind Rajab has filed more than a dozen complaints, either the victim or perpetrator must hold Dutch nationality, or the suspect must be in the country for the entirety of the investigation — factors likely to protect Israeli tourists from prosecution. Eleven complaints against 15 Israeli soldiers have been dismissed, some because the accused was only in the country for a short time, according to Dutch prosecutors. Two complaints involving four soldiers are pending. In 2016, activists in the U.K. made unsuccessful attempts to arrest Israeli military and political leaders for their roles in the 2008-09 war in Gaza. Raza says his group will persist. 'It might take 10 years. It might be 20 years. No problem. We are ready to have patience.' There is no statute of limitations on war crimes.

Two Jewish actors take top honors at Critics Choice Awards	While both actors are Jewish, they are not related. By Jewish Breaking News This year’s Critics Choice Awards notched big wins for two Jewish actors, with Adam Brody taking home best actor in a comedy series for his role as Rabbi Noah Roklov in Netflix’s hit interfaith romcom 'Nobody Wants This.' Adrien Brody won best actor in a drama for portraying a Holocaust survivor in 'The Brutalist.' In a fitting touch, Rachel Brosnahan, herself recognized for bringing Jewish representation to television as the star of 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,' presented Adam Brody with his award on Friday night in Santa Monica. 'Thank you for your talent, thank you for your kindness, thank you for your belief in me,' he told costar Kristen Bell. 'This is a Hanukkah present for you.' During the ceremony cameras captured a tender moment between the actor and his wife Leighton Meester, with whom he has two children. The pair lost their home in last month’s Palisades Fire in Los Angeles. 'Nobody Wants This' has been a surprise cultural phenomenon since its September launch, sparking widespread conversations about its portrayal of Jewish life and interfaith relationships. The show is set to begin filming its second season early this year. Taking the stage for his own award, Adrien Brody praised critics for making his 'very small, epic film very visible and accessible to people.' In The Brutalist, he plays a Jewish architect and Holocaust survivor who clashes with a wealthy patron after emigrating to the US. While both actors are Jewish, they are not related.

UN chief appeals to Hamas to release Israeli hostages	Hamas announced on Monday night that it would delay the hostage release scheduled for Feb. 15 until further notice due to what it alleged were Israeli violations of the truce. By JNS U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres on Tuesday urged the Hamas terror group to abide by its obligation to release additional Israeli hostages in accordance with its ceasefire agreement with the Jewish state. 'We must avoid at all costs resumption of hostilities in Gaza that would lead to immense tragedy. I appeal to Hamas to proceed with the planned liberation of hostages. Both sides must fully abide by their commitments in the ceasefire agreement & resume serious negotiations,' tweeted Guterres. Hamas announced on Monday night that it would delay the hostage release scheduled for Feb. 15 until further notice due to what it alleged were Israeli violations of the truce. Israel Defense Minister Israel Katz called Hamas’s announcement an 'outright violation of the ceasefire' and said he had instructed the Israeli military 'to prepare at the highest level of alert for any possible scenario in Gaza.' He added: 'We will not return to the reality of October 7.' Then-Foreign Minister Katz declared Guterres persona non grata in the Jewish state in October, hours before Rosh Hashanah began. 'Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran’s heinous attack on Israel, as almost every country in the world has done, does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil,' Katz stated at the time. 'This is a secretary-general who has yet to denounce the massacre and sexual atrocities committed by Hamas murderers on Oct. 7, nor has he led any efforts to declare them a terrorist organization.' 'Israel will continue to defend its citizens and uphold its national dignity, with or without António Guterres,' added Katz, referring to the secretary-general as 'a stain on the history of the United Nations.'

65% of Gaza’s structures said destroyed, reconstruction estimated...	Four thousand buildings within a mile of the Gaza-Israel border with Israel were also destroyed, also amounting to 100% of the structures in that area. By JNS About 65% of the structures in the Gaza Strip were destroyed during the year-long Israel-Hamas war, littering the enclave with hundreds of millions of tons of scattered debris, Hebrew media reported on Tuesday. Experts estimate reconstruction would take at least 10 years and cost tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. The outlet commissioned Adi Ben-Nun, a Geographic Information System (GIS) specialist and technical manager of the GIS center at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, to analyze satellite imagery of the Strip. According to that analysis, approximately 84% (25,927) of the structures in northern Gaza were destroyed (25,927), while in Gaza City the figure was about 72% (35,722). In the central camps some 33% (10,375) of the buildings were destroyed, while the figures for Khan Yunis and Rafah in southern Gaza were 73% (32,908) and 52% (15,434),' respectively. Three other areas stood out with regard to the level of destruction. In Jabaliya, located some 2.5 miles north of Gaza city, about 19,000 buildings were destroyed, or about 100% of the structures in the city. Four thousand buildings within a mile of the Gaza-Israel border with Israel were also destroyed, also amounting to 100% of the structures in that area. There was also total destruction for several miles to the north and south of the Netzarim Corridor separating northern and southern Gaza, according to the report. Satellite images also show that a buffer zone between Israel and Gaza has been completed, according to Channel 12. On Feb. 4, U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, after visiting Gaza, said that the damage he witnessed had convinced him it is currently too dangerous to inhabit. 'There are 30,000 unexploded munitions. It’s buildings that could tip over at any moment. There’s no utilities there whatsoever—no working water, electric, gas. Nothing. God knows what kind of disease might be festering there,' he said. Moreover, terrorist groups in Gaza had undermined the territory, he noted. 'They’ve dug tunnels underneath there that have basically degraded the stone that would form foundations. We have to examine that, and you do it with borings. You do it with subterranean surveys,' he said. The effort would take 'years on top of years,' he stressed, with the disposal effort alone requiring an estimated three to five. 'The president is intent on getting it all done correctly, so for me it is unfair to explain to Palestinians that they might be back in five years. That’s just preposterous,' said Witkoff. He backed U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza, arguing that a better life is not necessarily tied to a given piece of land. In an interview with Fox News, Witkoff emphasized that peace means improving financial conditions and opportunities. 'Peace in the region means a better life for the Palestinians. A better life is not necessarily tied to the physical space that you are in today,' he said. 'A better life is about better opportunity, better financial conditions, better aspirations for you and your family. That doesn’t occur because you get to pitch a tent in the Gaza Strip and you’re surrounded by 30,000 munitions that could go off at any moment,' he added.

Hamas responds to Trump’s ultimatum	United Nations Secretary-General urges Gaza terror group to implement planned hostage release, as Hamas rebuffs President Trump's warning that 'all hell will break loose' if Israeli hostages are not release on Saturday. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization on Tuesday rebuffed an ultimatum issued by President Donald Trump, demanding the Gaza group release all remaining hostages by this coming Saturday. A spokesman for the terror group, Sami Abu Zuhri, told Reuters Tuesday morning that his threats 'have no value,' reiterating its claims that Israel has violated the ceasefire deal. 'Trump must remember that there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties, and this is the only way to bring back the [hostages]. The language of threats has no value and only complicates matters,' Abu Zuhri said. A day earlier, Hamas announced that it will not be releasing Israeli hostages this coming Saturday as planned unless its demands are met. Accusing Israel of delaying the return of Palestinian Arabs to northern Gaza and limiting the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip, Hamas demanded changes on the ground before more hostages are release. Later that day, Trump warned that should Hamas renege on the hostage deal, 'all hell' would break loose. 'If all the Gaza hostages aren’t returned by Saturday at 12:00 p.m., I would say cancel the ceasefire. Let all hell break loose,' Trump said, adding, 'Israel can override it.' United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a statement Tuesday morning, urging Hamas to adhere to the hostage release schedule and to free the captives slated to be returned to Israel this Saturday. 'We must avoid at all costs the resumption of hostilities in Gaza that would lead to an immense tragedy,' Guterres said. 'I appeal to Hamas to proceed with the planned liberation of hostages next Saturday.' Guterres also called on Israel and Hamas to reach a deal to implement the second phase of the three-part truce agreement. 'Both sides must fully abide by their commitments in the cease-fire agreement and resume serious negotiations in Doha for the second phase.'

Elderly hostage slated for release reported dead	Shlomo Mansour was killed while in Hamas captivity, officials from his hometown say, while family of twin brothers held hostage say they have received a sign of life. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News An elderly Israeli hostage taken captive by Hamas terrorists during the October 7th, 2023 invasion was killed while in captivity, officials from his hometown announced Tuesday morning. Shlomo Mansour, 86, was among the 251 people abducted by Gaza terrorists on October 7th, 2023, and forced over the border into the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday, Kibbutz Kissufim, the Gaza border community where Mansour had resided, issued a statement saying that Mansour had been murdered by Hamas terrorists while in captivity. 'With a heavy heart, we kibbutz members received the news this morning of the murder in Hamas captivity of our dear friend, Shlomo Mansour, 86, who was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Kissufim in the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7, 2023,' the statement reads in part. The kibbutz did not provide details regarding how Mansour's death was confirmed. 'This is one of the most difficult days in the history of our kibbutz. Shlomo was much more than a community member to us – he was a father, a grandfather, a true friend and the beating heart of Kissufim,' the kibbutz said. 'His smile, modesty and human warmth were an inspiration to us all. Our hearts are broken that we were unable to bring him back to us alive. The entire community grieves his loss and is united in grief and pain.' Due to his advanced age, Mansour had been included in the list of 33 Israeli hostages slated for release during the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Prior to Tuesday, however, there were no reports Mansour had been killed in captivity. According to Hamas, eight of the hostages slated for release are dead, though the terror group has not identified which captives are no longer alive. Also on Tuesday, the family of twin brothers taken hostage on October 7th reported receiving a sign of life of the two men. Relatives of Gali Berman and his brother Ziv, 27, of Kibbutz Kfar Aza said they have received information regarding their condition. 'We take a deep breath, but we know whose hands they are in and how much danger their lives are in,' the family said Tuesday.

‘Nobody wants to die’ – Trump says Iran ‘very nervous,’ ready for...	President Trump blasts Obama's 2015 Iran nuclear agreement as 'the dumbest deal,' says Iran cannot be allowed to achieve a nuclear capacity, with only a new deal or Israeli airstrikes capable of preventing them from achieving it. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump warned that Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons either through a new deal to replace the 2015 nuclear agreement, or airstrikes on the country's atomic facilities. Speaking with Fox News on Monday night, the president said that while he preferred to resolve the issue via negotiations, he will not allow Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons. 'Everyone thinks Israel, with our help or our approval, will go in and bomb the hell out of [Iran],' Trump said. 'I would prefer that not happen. I'd much rather see a deal with Iran where we can do a deal, supervise, check it, inspect it, and then blow it up or just make sure that there's no more nuclear.' Trump went on to deride the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed by the Obama administration, as 'the dumbest deal.' 'By the way, that would have expired by now. That was a road to a nuclear weapon. It was a short-term deal,' Trump said of the JCPOA's sunset clause, under which certain restrictions would automatically end after 10 years. 'You can't make a deal with just a few years on it. That deal would be expired by now. Think of it. And they would have a legal right to have a nuclear weapon.' 'You cannot allow Iran, or just about anybody else, by the way, but especially Iran, because they are very militant. You can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon.' Trump claimed that Iran's leadership is 'very concerned' over Tehran's increasing isolation regionally and internationally, following Israeli airstrikes last year, the new sanctions imposed by the Trump White House and the loss of key allies over the past six months including the Assad regime, Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah, and Hamas' Yahya Sinwar. 'But there's two ways of stopping them, with bombs or with a written piece of paper. And I'd much rather do a deal that's a deal that's not going to hurt them.' 'I think that Iran is very concerned. I think that Iran is very frightened, to be honest with you, because their defense is pretty much gone.' 'They've had some very bad moments. The whole thing with the [Hezbollah] pagers was a disaster for them. The pagers, you know what I'm talking about.' 'It was a horrible thing, but it was, you know, it knocked out a lot of leadership like nobody's ever seen before. But I think Iran is very nervous. I think they're scared. I think Iran would love to make a deal, and I would love to make a deal with them without bombing them.'

Arab-Israeli murder rate 3rd-highest in developed world – study	Arab Israelis face a murder rate rivaling that of Mexico and Colombia, with no signs of slowing down. By World Israel News Staff The murder rate among Arab Israelis is one of the worst in the developed world, with the number of killings per 100,000 people nearing that of Mexico, a recent study found. According to a study published by the Taub Center, a Jerusalem-based nonprofit organization focusing on Israeli societal issues, 233 Arab Israelis were murdered in 2023, the most recent year in which full data was available. Notably, the number of Jewish victims of homicide during that same year (those killed in criminal incidents, not terror attacks) was just 66, akin to the murder rate in Switzerland. 'Israeli Arabs, with a current rate of 11.1 homicides per 100,000 people and 43.9 homicides per 100,000 people aged 20‒34, climb to the 3rd-highest position, far surpassing the U.S. and trailing only Mexico and Colombia,' wrote researchers from the Taub Center. 'From a sociological perspective, this makes sense,' they added. 'A culture of violence tends to spread and become entrenched, as has happened among the Arab population in recent years, and violence tends to increase, especially during periods of instability in the country, as we have been experiencing in Israel over the past year.' Arab Israelis have long complained that the Israeli police have neglected their communities, but suggestions to use Shin Bet resources and other alternatives to clamp down on murders have been rejected by the sector's leadership. Police often are unable to prosecute murder cases involving Arab victims, even when they are able to identify the perpetrators, because members of the community are typically unwilling to testify in court or cooperate with the authorities. 'We are committed to taking decisive action against crime and violence using all available resources to increase security in the Arab community,' the Israel Police said in a media statement to Hebrew-language outlet Globes. 'Over the past year, we have prevented dozens of murders by intercepting criminals before they could carry out their plans, thwarted weapons smuggling, and seized thousands of illegal weapon, each one potentially saving lives. The Police Commissioner has ordered an increase in forces and the use of all necessary tools to locate and arrest violent offenders who pose a threat to public safety.'

NY Times Oct. 7th war coverage ‘distorted, imbalanced’ – Study	Data analysis finds that the New York Times presented Palestinian death statistics without mentioning Hamas fighters killed battling IDF troops, glossed over murders of Israeli civilians in terror attacks and bombings. By World Israel News Staff A data analyses of some 1,500 articles about the October 7th massacres and subsequent Israel-Hamas war published by the New York Times revealed that the media outlet presented a narrative to its readership that downplayed Israeli suffering and focused little on Hamas atrocities. The study was conducted independently by Edieal Pinker, a professor and deputy dean at the Yale School of Management, and published in SSRN, a journal for research papers that have not yet undergone peer review. 'Little mention is made of Israeli casualties post-October 7 or of Palestinian acts of violence post-October 7, even as Israel and Hamas were locked in intensive combat over the eight months of the study period,' the study said, according to a Times of Israel summary. 91 percent of the articles published by the Times on the conflict did not mention Israeli casualties sustained after October 7th, glossing over the fact that dozens of civilians were murdered in terror attacks and by Hezbollah and Hamas bombings. 'The reporting does not give the reader a full understanding of how the war is being experienced by Israelis,' the study said. The study also noted that only 10 percent of articles published by the outlet specified that Hamas fighters were killed during battles with Israeli troops, though they mentioned the deaths of Palestinians. There were more than 10 weeks in which no Times articles acknowledged Hamas members fighting Israel, giving readers the impression that all reported Palestinian deaths were of civilians. In a statement to the Times of Israel, the New York Times defended its reporting of the war. A spokesman from the outlet claimed that the newsppaer had 'covered this war with more rigor than virtually any other U.S. news organization, reporting on the conflict from all angles,' claiming it had published reports on 'previously unknown details about the atrocities committed by Hamas' and the 'ferocious military campaign led by the Israeli government.' The newspaper also claimed that their 'editors make careful and deliberate choices about every story we publish to ensure our language, framing, prominence and tone remain true to our mission of independent journalism.' Notably, the Times statement did not directly acknowledge or address any of the data-based points around its coverage that were highlighted in the study.

US: All IDF soldiers must withdraw from Lebanon by next week	Israel’s withdrawal remains on the existing timeline, and they did not request an extension,' says Trump administration official. By World Israel News Staff The United States expects Israel to withdraw all of its troops from southern Lebanon by next week, Trump administration officials confirmed on Monday. 'Israel’s withdrawal remains on the existing timeline, and they did not request an extension' for troops to remain in southern Lebanon later than February 18th, U.S. National Security Council Spokesperson Brian Hughes told The Jerusalem Post. In late November, Israel and Lebanon signed a truce, pushed by the Biden administration, which was originally scheduled to end on January 27th. That agreement required the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanese territory by the end of January. Shortly after President Donald Trump was inaugurated in late January, Israel was granted an extension until February 18th, allowing IDF soldiers to remain on Lebanese soil. At the time, Israel said that Lebanon had not held up its end of the bargain, with Hezbollah terrorists remaining south of the Litani River and the Lebanese Army failing to deploy en masse to the region and root out Hezbollah operatives, which constitute a violation of the ceasefire. But although displaced residents of northern Israel have still not been able to return home due to the ongoing threat from Hezbollah, Washington still expects Israel to withdraw by the February deadline. Channel 12 News reported on Monday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked Trump to permit Israeli troops to remain at a number critical strategic posts in southern Lebanon until further notice. Netanyahu is reportedly arguing that the Lebanese Army is not able to stop Hezbollah from regrouping in the area, and that the terror group will once again resume positions directly adjacent to the Israeli border when Israeli troops are withdrawn. According to the report, Israel wants to station soldiers at five locations near the border, within Lebanese territory, creating a buffer zone that will protect residents of northern Israel.

Trump issues ultimatum to Hamas with deadline to release all host...	Trump's remarks were made shortly after Hamas revealed that the planned release of hostages scheduled for February 15 had been suspended indefinitely due to what it described as an Israeli 'violation' of the ceasefire terms. By World Israel News On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump issued a strong warning to Hamas, stating that the ceasefire agreement should be canceled if all hostages held in Gaza are not released by noon on Saturday. 'If all the Gaza hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12:00 p.m., I would say cancel the ceasefire. Let all hell break loose,' Trump said, adding, 'Israel can override it.' Trump's remarks were made shortly after Hamas posted an announcement on its Telegram account, revealing that the planned release of hostages scheduled for February 15 had been suspended indefinitely due to what it described as an Israeli 'violation' of the ceasefire terms. Following the announcement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held consultations with top security officials and rescheduled a cabinet meeting originally set for Tuesday evening to take place on Tuesday morning instead. In its statement, Hamas described the delay in releasing hostages as a 'warning' to Israel and mediating nations, aiming to pressure Israel into strict adherence to the ceasefire agreement. The terror group accused Israel of failing to fulfill key obligations, citing violations such as delays in allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, attacks involving shelling and gunfire, and failure to deliver agreed humanitarian aid. 'Over the last three weeks, the leadership of the resistance has monitored the enemy's violations and non-compliance with the terms of the agreement. From delaying the return of displaced persons to northern Gaza Strip, and attacking them by shelling and shooting in various areas of the Strip, to not bringing aid equipment in all its forms as agreed, while the resistance has fulfilled all its commitments,' a Hamas spokesperson stated. In response, the Israeli government issued a statement: 'The terrorist organization is responsible for the violations. Members of the delegation who returned from Qatar this morning stated that Hamas’s actions jeopardize the continuation of the deal.' Israel’s Defense Minister, Israel Katz, also condemned Hamas’s decision, saying: 'Hamas’s announcement that it will halt the release of Israeli hostages is a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement. I have instructed the IDF to maintain the highest level of readiness for any possible scenario in Gaza and to ensure the defense of communities near the border. We will not allow a return to the reality of October 7th.'

Hamas official threatens: ‘October 7th was just a prelude’	On Monday, Hamas announced it would pause hostage releases, citing alleged 'Israeli violations' of the agreement. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Khaled al-Qa'id, one of the few remaining Hamas leaders, claimed a military victory in Gaza and warned, 'October 7th was just a prelude.' He stated, 'The October 7 attack was merely a prelude to the complete liberation of the entire Land of Israel from Jewish control.' Al-Qa'id declared Hamas’s victory in the Gaza war, saying it was 'made possible by the unity of the Palestinian people with the fighting forces and the resilience of those who remain steadfast on their land, refusing to leave.' He also thanked Iran for supporting Hamas and supplying weapons to the terror group. Al-Qa'id asserted that Palestinians are not afraid of Israel and that Hamas is prepared to fight until 'victory or death.' On Monday, Hamas announced it would pause hostage releases, citing alleged 'Israeli violations' of the agreement. In response, the Israeli government issued a statement: 'The terrorist organization is responsible for the violations. Members of the delegation who returned from Qatar this morning stated that Hamas’s actions jeopardize the continuation of the deal.' On Thursday, Hamas called on Arab countries to reject U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza and take control of the territory during reconstruction. The group also urged Arab nations to convene an emergency summit to counter what it described as Trump’s 'displacement project.' Hamas claimed that Washington’s position on the Gaza Strip signaled a U.S. intention to occupy the territory. 'We do not need any nation to govern the Gaza Strip, and we reject replacing one occupation with another,' the group stated. 'We urge Arab countries to resist pressure from Trump and stand firm in rejecting the displacement plan,' Hamas added. Last week, during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump announced that his administration intends to relocate the entire population of the Gaza Strip to third-party countries. The U.S. would then assume control of the enclave for rehabilitation and reconstruction.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, Israel responded to Hamas’s announcement that it would suspend the hostage release deal, stating that Hamas, not Israel, had violated the agreement. A Hamas spokesman on Monday accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire agreement and claimed that the IDF had targeted Palestinians in Gaza. In response, the Israeli government issued a statement: 'The terrorist organization is responsible for the violations. Members of the delegation who returned from Qatar this morning stated that Hamas’s actions jeopardize the continuation of the deal.' Israel’s Defense Minister, Israel Katz, also condemned Hamas's decision, saying: 'Hamas’s announcement that it will halt the release of Israeli hostages is a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement. I have instructed the IDF to maintain the highest level of readiness for any possible scenario in Gaza and to ensure the defense of communities near the border. We will not allow a return to the reality of October 7th.' Katz referred to an incident on Sunday in which the IDF fired warning shots at a crowd of Gazans who violated the ceasefire agreement by entering the buffer zone and approaching Israel’s border near Kibbutz Nahal Oz. According to media reports, three people were killed in the incident. Following the event, Katz stated: 'Israel’s security stance on Gaza remains firm: Anyone entering the buffer zone does so at their own risk. There will be no tolerance for those who pose a threat to IDF forces, the border region, or nearby communities.' Regarding Hamas's decision to halt hostage releases, the Prime Minister's Office reassured families, saying: 'All hostage families were updated this evening following Hamas’s announcement. They were assured that the State of Israel remains fully committed to the agreement and views any violation of it with utmost seriousness.' Otzma Yehudit Chairman MK Itamar Ben Gvir urged the government to respond to the cancellation of the hostage releases with a full-scale assault on Gaza, 'from the air and the ground,' and to halt all deliveries of humanitarian aid. Ben Gvir declared: 'We must resume the war and destroy them!'

The 'pay-for-slay' program refers to the PA's policy of providing financial support to terrorists who carry out attacks against Israelis. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Although Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas signed a decree on Monday to end the notorious 'pay-for-slay' program, which compensates terrorists, payments are expected to continue from another source. The 'pay-for-slay' program refers to the PA's policy of providing financial support to terrorists who carry out attacks against Israelis. Although Abbas indicated he was ending this program, Wafa reported that the payments are merely being transferred from the Ministry of Social Development to the National Palestinian Economic Empowerment Institution, an entity under PA control. Additionally, families of terrorists will remain eligible for financial aid under the same criteria as needy families. A decision was made to allow Israel to cease its policy of deducting tax funds from payments to terrorists and their families. Hamas condemned the PA’s apparent cancellation of the program, stating, 'We condemn his decision to cancel the payments to the families of the prisoners, the dead, and the wounded, and to abandon the national cause at a time when our people and the resistance forces are working to safeguard the rights of the released prisoners and to ensure their lives.' Before this decision, there was already a downward trend in the payments terrorist families received for attacks. According to research, the Palestinian Authority’s payments under the 'pay-for-slay' program decreased by 30 to 40% in 2024, despite an expected increase. Col. (res.) Adv. Maurice Hirsch, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, identified several factors contributing to this decline. First, bureaucratic difficulties have arisen since Red Cross representatives have been barred from visiting prisons. Second, Hirsch stated, 'The economic pressure on the Palestinian Authority has reached an unprecedented level. According to new data from the Finance Ministry, Israel has deducted approximately NIS 3 billion from PA funds as of November 2024.' A third factor is the ongoing war in Gaza, which has disrupted the transfer of funds and the documentation required to access them.

Isolated, starved, burned, gagged: hostages’ testimony reveals Ha...	The former hostages reported being interrogated and burned, leading one of them to collapse. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The emaciated appearance of the three hostages released on Saturday was a testament to the severe abuses they suffered at the hands of their Hamas captors. Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami, and Eli Sharabi reported being isolated in tunnels, hung upside down, burned, starved, gagged, deprived of daylight, and subjected to psychological torture. They also witnessed similar treatment of other hostages who were slated for release. 'They treated us like animals,' one of the three released hostages said. The former hostages reported being interrogated and burned, leading one of them to collapse. The three men were forced to endure days without food while their captors taunted them and ate in front of them, finally providing only one stale pita to share among several hostages. Hamas captors often put a cloth around their mouths and gagged them, making it seem as though they were going to suffocate them. Sigi Cohen, mother of hostage Eliya Cohen, said that released hostages informed her that her son had been chained and confined to a tunnel, had not seen sunlight during his entire captivity, and was given very little food. They also reported that Cohen had been tortured by being hung by his feet upside down and burned with a metal object. In addition to the torments he endured in captivity, Cohen has an untreated bullet wound that he sustained on October 7th. Hostage Alon Ohel, whose family received information that he was alive, reported that he had also been chained, starved, and was suffering from medical neglect after sustaining a shrapnel wound and a severe eye injury. Ohel's family has released a statement advocating for his liberation. They wrote, 'Tomorrow, Alon will spend his 24th birthday in Hamas captivity. We urge the prime minister, the cabinet, and the Israeli government—time is running out. The second phase of the deal must proceed to bring all the hostages home. It is your moral obligation to do everything possible to save Alon and the others.'

The event marked the first such celebration under Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who took office after Ebrahim Raisi’s death in a helicopter crash in May 2024. By JNS Tens of thousands of Iranians gathered in Tehran on Monday to mark the 46th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which led to the overthrow of the U.S.-backed shah and the establishment of Iran’s theocracy, the Associated Press reported. The event occurred amid economic struggles caused by U.S. sanctions and escalating tensions with Washington following President Donald Trump’s return to office and renewed 'maximum pressure' sanctions campaign. Protesters carried anti-American and anti-Israeli banners, with some calling for Israel’s destruction. The rally also showcased military displays, including missile replicas. Iran is celebrating the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. I hope this is their last celebrate. pic.twitter.com/0RHHBR38ZD &mdash; Eli Afriat (@EliAfriatISR) February 10, 2025 Over the past year, Iran launched unprecedented direct missile and drone attacks against Israel. Iran’s Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, also attacked Israel, escalating the conflict. However, Israel and its allies intercepted most of the Iranian strikes, which were followed by Israeli retaliatory attacks that significantly damaged Iran’s air defenses and weapons production sites. The war with Hezbollah ended with a ceasefire in November, while negotiations continue over a three-phase truce with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The event marked the first such celebration under Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who took office after Ebrahim Raisi’s death in a helicopter crash in May 2024. Meanwhile, Trump told The New York Post on Saturday that he favors resolving the Iran nuclear issue diplomatically rather than through military action. However, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday dismissed the idea of talks with the United States, saying, 'Negotiating with such a government should not be done.'

Knesset bill seeks to replace ‘West Bank’ with ‘Judea and Samaria...	West Bank,' although more common in modern parlance, has a recent provenance, having been coined by Jordan, which controlled the area for a short time (1948-1967), in an attempt to erase the area’s historic Jewish connection. By JNS Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday approved a Knesset bill to replace the term 'West Bank' with 'Judea and Samaria' in Israeli government documents. 'Judea and Samaria are an inseparable part of the historic homeland of the Jewish people,' the bill states. 'The most decisive events in our history took place in these regions, where our forefathers, prophets, sages and kings established their capital and kingdom. 'In contrast, the term ‘West Bank,’ which originated in a period of foreign rule, reflects a colonialist perspective that ignores the deep historical connection of the Jewish people to its land,' it adds. Committee chairman Simcha Rothman, who introduced the bill, told JNS: 'Semantics are important because through incorrect terminology, the lie wins. You have to describe reality correctly and tell the truth, and this is the first step to correcting the reality.' 'Judea and Samaria' is an ancient term. Judea derives from the name of the Kingdom of Judah, founded in 934 B.C.E., the source of the term 'Jews.' 'Samaria' comes from the ancient city of Samaria, capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel, an independent realm made up of the Hebrew tribes of Reuben, Simeon, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Manasseh and Ephraim; now known as the 10 Lost Tribes, who were taken into captivity by Assyria around 720 BCE. 'West Bank,' although more common in modern parlance, has a recent provenance, having been coined by Jordan, which controlled the area for a short time (1948-1967), in an attempt to erase the area’s historic Jewish connection. The Romans had an identical purpose when in 135 BCE, after defeating the Second Jewish Revolt, they renamed the Roman province of Judaea (an area larger than present day Judea) 'Syria Palaestina' (from which the modern term 'Palestine' comes). They wanted to sever the Jewish connection to the land. Palaestina referenced the Philistines, a people who lived along the coast but had disappeared by the 6th century BCE. 'As chairman of the Constitution Committee, we often get laws that replace terms with more ‘correct’ terms, and I thought that instead of chasing the culture of political correctness, it was time for us to chase after [our own history] for once,' Rothman told JNS. His timing was also influenced by the change in administration in the United States. The 'new administration and the new Congress [are] committed to the historical truth, that the Land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel,' he said. He noted parallel legislative efforts in the United States. U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) have both introduced bills requiring 'all official U.S. documents and materials to use the historically accurate term ‘Judea and Samaria’ instead of the ‘West Bank.'' On Feb. 29, Tenney, in a statement on her website announcing her bill, said, 'The Israeli people have an undeniable and indisputable historical and legal claim over Judea and Samaria.' Cotton, announcing his bill on Feb. 4, said, 'The Jewish people’s legal and historic rights to Judea and Samaria goes back thousands of years. The U.S. should stop using the politically charged term West Bank to refer to the biblical heartland of Israel.' There has been some debate in the coalition about Rothman’s bill. In Sunday’s committee discussion, Shlomo Karhi of the Likud Party, who serves as Communications Minister, suggested that it would be better for the coalition to focus on sovereignty rather than semantics. 'It’s dealing with something that we intend to solve in a completely different way,' said Karhi, according to Kan News. Rothman told JNS however that the difference of opinion wouldn’t affect the bill’s passage. 'Even Karhi’s words did not come as an opposition to the law, but as a statement and a hope, which I myself join, that sovereignty will soon be applied and this law, like other laws that I am promoting myself, together with my colleagues in the Land of Israel Lobby, will become redundant,' he said. Rothman said that he 'definitely' expects the bill to pass.

Trump says no right of return for Palestinians in Gaza under his ...	It comes as he has ramped up pressure on Arab states, especially U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt, to take in Palestinians from Gaza. By The Associated Press President Donald Trump said Palestinians in Gaza would not have a right to return under his plan for U.S. 'ownership' of the war-torn territory, contradicting other officials in his administration who have sought to argue Trump was only calling for the temporary relocation of its population. Less than a week after he floated his plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and turn it in 'the Riviera of the Middle East,' Trump, in an interview with FOX News' Bret Baier that was set to air on Monday, said 'No, they wouldn’t' when asked if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory. It comes as he has ramped up pressure on Arab states, especially U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt, to take in Palestinians from Gaza. 'We’ll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,' Trump said. 'In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land. No big money spent.' Arab nations have sharply criticized the Trump proposal, and Trump’s latest words were released a day before he is set to host Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday. After Trump's initial comments last week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Marco Rubio respectfully insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza 'temporarily' and for an 'interim' period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordinance and reconstruction. Trump last week didn't rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure the territory but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of Gaza, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan.

Anti-Trump think tanks rake in millions from taxpayers for ‘virtu...	Republicans have criticized both think tanks over their central roles in what’s been dubbed the 'censorship-industrial complex,' a network of university and think tank researchers that worked closely with federal agencies to censor content on social media. By Chuck Ross, The Washington Free Beacon Federal agencies have awarded nearly $50 million over the past four years to the Aspen Institute and the Atlantic Council—well-funded liberal think tanks which between them boast 50 donors who have given them at least $1 million—for projects that include a $6 million program to provide 'virtual exchanges' for students in the Middle East, and $300,000 to host a conference to empower women in Saudi Arabia. The grants are but two examples of the taxpayer funds that flow to the country’s biggest think tanks. The State Department, USAID, and Department of Defense have awarded $15.3 million in grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to the Atlantic Council since 2021, and $32.6 million to the Aspen Institute over the same span, according to federal spending records. Taxpayer support for two deep-pocketed institutions could draw fresh scrutiny as the Trump administration—largely through the Department of Government Efficiency, the government unit led by Elon Musk—is scouring the federal government’s books for signs of fraud and wasteful spending. Trump this week moved to shut down USAID, an independent agency that has long worked with the State Department, over its funding for foreign aid programs deemed to be wasteful and nonessential. The Aspen Institute and the Atlantic Council, among the largest think tank recipients of taxpayer funding, have received tens of millions of dollars in donations from an impressive roster of corporations, tech billionaires, philanthropies, foreign companies, and governments. In 2023 alone, the Atlantic Council received 12 donations of at least $1 million each from Meta, Goldman Sachs, the government of the United Arab Emirates, and the Rockefeller Foundation, according to its donor list. The Aspen Institute disclosed that 38 donors gave at least $1 million in 2023, including Walmart, Google, the Ford Foundation, and the philanthropies of billionaires Bill Gates and Mike Bloomberg. Both organizations could present ripe targets for the administration’s cost-cutting measures, for not just their sizable warchests, but also their hostilities towards President Donald Trump. 'There is absolutely no reason that these research projects at the Atlantic Council and Aspen Institute should have even been considered for a government grant,' said Parker Thayer, an investigator at Capital Research Center, a watchdog group that recently launched the DOGE Files to track federal spending. 'Not only are the projects plainly ridiculous wastes of taxpayer money, but both organization have more than a few mega-donors to be getting along with.' Like many Beltway think tanks, the Aspen Institute and the Atlantic Council have been highly critical of Trump’s policies, both domestic and foreign. Aspen Institute president Dan Porterfield said Trump 'fomented' the 'deadly insurrection' at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Katie Couric, the former TV journalist and co-chair of Aspen Institute’s Commission on Information Disorder, has called Trump a 'fascist' and compared a Trump campaign rally at Madison Square Garden last year to a 'Nazi event.' Republicans have criticized both think tanks over their central roles in what’s been dubbed the 'censorship-industrial complex,' a network of university and think tank researchers that worked closely with federal agencies to censor content on social media. In September 2020, the Aspen Institute organized a 'tabletop' exercise with journalists from the New York Times, and Washington Post, and executives from Facebook and Twitter to draft a plan for how to respond to a hypothetical scenario in which Russia leaked documents stolen from Hunter Biden, according to documents uncovered by reporter Michael Shellenberger. Many of the participants—most notably Twitter—censored an accurate New York Post story about Biden’s laptop in Oct. 2020. The Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab is led by Graham Brookie, who served on the National Security Council in the Obama administration. In October 2020, Brookie claimed Trump’s 'entire strategy' in the campaign that year was 'based on process disinformation in this election.' Days later, Brookie dismissed reports of Hunter Biden’s laptop as 'unverified misinfo.' He cheered Twitter’s ban of Trump’s account and 'influencers of the far right' after the Jan. 6 Capitol riots as a 'welcome' decision. The State Department awarded the DFRLab a $64,000 grant in September to host two workshops at the U.S. embassy in Vienna on 'countering foreign information manipulation and interference,' and $250,000 the same month for a project to counter disinformation in Moldova, according to spending records. Other grants to the think tanks could land in the cost-cutters’ crosshairs. On Jan. 1, the State Department gave the Atlantic Council $500,000 for a project slated to run through Oct. 2026, to 'promote responsible trade' in the western Balkans—a region that includes Serbia and Albania—in order to 'support the region’s alignment with a Euro-Atlantic path.' The State Department’s $6 million contract with the Aspen Institute in September will help fund an online exchange program with students and young people in North Africa and the Middle East, to teach them about 'civic engagement,' 'climate change and sustainability,' and other topics. The program involves the use of recorded messages exchanged between students in different countries. In 2021, USAID struck a five-year, $9 million agreement with the Aspen Institute to 'promote investment in Guatemalan entrepreneurs and innovators.' Aspen selected one program participant that will help 'rural communities increase investment capability and access new markets for specialty mushroom, honey, and coffee products.' In many cases, American taxpayers are funding programs that involve the think tanks’ major foreign donors. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—where the Atlantic Council held State Department-funded women’s empowerment conferences—are some of the think tank’s biggest donors. The Saudi-owned Aramco Americas and King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center donated $400,000 to the Atlantic Council in 2023, and the Emirates gave $1.85 million the same year. The State Department gave $40,000 to the Atlantic Council last year for a study and presentation on the threats posed by Russia’s 'shadow fleet' to Denmark. The Danish embassy donated at least $100,000 to the Atlantic Council in 2023. A spokesperson for the Atlantic Council said the State Department has paused funding for a small number of its projects regarding Chinese and Russian influence in response to Trump's executive order to reevaluate foreign aid spending. 'If these sorts of programs are discontinued, the biggest beneficiaries will be America’s adversaries, who are eager to expand their influence in key regions,' the spokesperson said. 'However, the vast majority of our work continues as planned, and we remain committed to delivering on our mission of galvanizing U.S. leadership and engagement in the world, in partnership with allies and partners, to shape solutions to global challenges. The Aspen Institute did not respond to a request for comment.

Digital warfare ‘has reached every home in Israel’ says cyber saf...	Fraud and online scams comprised 17.6% of total helpline reports, followed by cases of sexual harassment at 11.5%. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli Internet Association reported a sharp rise in cyber incidents targeting Israeli citizens in its annual report, released on Monday. The report, based on the activities of the Association’s Safe Internet Helpline, noted unprecedented levels of cyberattacks, fraud and breached social media accounts. 'The war in the digital arena and on the networks has reached every home in Israel,' the report said. Data from the report showed that 45% of all calls to the helpline this year concerned cyber-related issues, a significant increase from 36% last year. Among the most frequent reports were incidents involving hacking into social media accounts, which accounted for 27% of all calls. A notable shift has occurred in the platforms most frequently reported for fraud and cyberattacks. For the first time, WhatsApp has taken the top spot, with 21.7% of complaints directed at the messaging platform. Facebook, which previously held the leading position, followed closely with 19% of complaints. Instagram ranked third with 15.6% of reports. Complaints related to Telegram have also increased sharply, reaching 4.1% of total reports. In the Arab sector, TikTok has emerged as a major concern, with 15% of complaints from that community directed at the platform. The helpline recorded approximately 1,100 calls related to hacking and account takeovers this year, representing a 20% increase compared to the previous year. Fraud and online scams comprised 17.6% of total reports, followed by cases of sexual harassment at 11.5%. Impersonation and privacy violations accounted for 10.9% of complaints, while reports of false and misleading content about the war made up 10.6%. The war has played a role in the escalation of cyber threats, with digital attacks and harassment becoming more prevalent across various online platforms. The Israeli Internet Association has taken steps to combat harmful online content by submitting hundreds of removal requests to digital platforms. Facebook received the highest number of requests, with 322 submissions, and responded positively to 98% of them. TikTok, which received 137 requests, removed 95% of the reported content. The association has successfully facilitated the removal of offensive content in 94% of all cases reported by users. 'This is further evidence that the war has reached the doorsteps of all citizens of the country through the digital arena,' said Edan Ring, the Association’s Vice President of community and social affairs. 'Attempts to attack and harass citizens on the cyber front have grown by tens of percent in the past year. The Israeli Internet Association has succeeded in removing offensive content on the leading platforms in 94% of the requests and continues to help citizens report and remove offensive content. But the first line of defense against attacks must be the citizens themselves – by increasing protective measures such as two-step verification and passwords, reporting directly to the platforms and the helpline, and increasing vigilance and caution in cyberspace as well,' Ring added.

Hamas accuses Israel of ceasefire violations and says it will del...	The next exchange was scheduled for Saturday, releasing three Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. By The Associated Press A Hamas spokesman on Monday accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement with the group, including targeting Palestinians in Gaza with airstrikes, and said that next Saturday's hostage release would be delayed. A Hamas spokesperson said Monday that the group will delay the next hostage release after accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement. Israel and Hamas are in the midst of a six-week ceasefire during which Hamas is releasing dozens of the hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The sides have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire went into effect last month, freeing 21 hostages and over 730 prisoners. The next exchange was scheduled for Saturday, releasing three Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for Hamas’ military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, accused Israel on Monday of systematically violating the ceasefire agreement over the past three weeks, and said Saturday's release would be delayed. 'The resistance leadership has closely monitored the enemy’s violations and its failure to uphold the terms of the agreement,' Abu Ubaida said. 'This includes delays in allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, targeting them with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas of the Strip, and failing to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.'

Trump: US will be ‘buying and owning’ Gaza	US might allow Middle Eastern allies to develop parts of Gaza Strip, says Trump, but America will 'own it,' and ensure Hamas 'doesn't move back.' By World Israel News Staff The United States will be 'buying' and 'owning' the Gaza Strip, President Donald Trump said over the weekend, emphasizing that while America's Middle Eastern allies could play a role in Gaza's rehabilitation and reconstruction, the U.S. would retain ownership of the territory. Trump made the comments while speaking with reporters on board Air Force One on Sunday, en route to New Orleans ahead of the Super Bowl. The president said his administration is 'in no rush' to implement his plan, but doubled-down on his previous claims that the U.S. will 'own' Gaza. 'I’m committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it, other people may do it, through our auspices,' Trump said, adding that the U.S. would ensure Hamas does not attempt to return to the coastal enclave. 'We’re committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn’t move back.' 'Think of it as a big real estate site, and the United States is going to own it, and will slowly, very slowly, we’re in no rush, in development. We're going to bring stability to the Middle East.' The president said that in its present condition, Gaza was a 'demolition site.' 'It'll be reclaimed. It'll be leveled out, fixed up. There won't be anybody there. Hamas won’t be there. We'll be building through other of the very rich countries in the Middle East, they'll be building some beautiful sites for the people, the Palestinians, to live in. They'll be living in harmony and peace, relatively, for the first time in hundreds of years.' Trump said the plan was ensure the safety of Palestinian civilians, and suggested he may be open to permitting some to move to the United States. 'We’re gonna take care of the Palestinians and make sure… they’re not murdered.'

KLM and Ryanair return to Israel with budget-friendly fares	As for North American passengers, United Airlines announced it will resume flying to Israel starting March 15, while Delta Airlines will resume service from New York-JFK to Tel Aviv on April 1. By Jewish Breaking News The summer of 2025 will bring more than just heat to Israel, as European aviation giants make their long-awaited return to Ben Gurion Airport with fares that seem almost too good to be true. Both Ryanair and KLM made significant announcements on Sunday regarding their return to Israeli skies post-Oct. 7. For Israeli travelers itching to explore Europe, Ryanair’s return comes with an enticing array of 23 destinations. Italy takes center stage with seven different routes, while those dreaming of Greek getaways can choose between Athens, Thessaloniki, and, starting in June, the charming coastal city of Chania. German-bound passengers haven’t been forgotten either, with flights to Berlin, Baden-Baden, and Memmingen all on the roster. A quick hop to Paphos, Cyprus, will set travelers back just €37 one-way, while those looking to venture further can reach Bucharest for €45, Vienna for €46, Budapest for €48, or Malta for a mere €50. Round-trip deals are equally attractive, with April flights to Rome available for €140, Berlin for €150, and Athens for €160. However, these introductory prices are expected to shift with demand and season. Meanwhile, KLM’s evening departures from Amsterdam at 9:10 PM, arriving in Tel Aviv in the early hours, and return flights leaving at 4:45 AM, offer more than just a direct link to the Netherlands. The Dutch carrier’s network opens up connections to 270 destinations through its Schiphol airport hub, which will significantly expand travel options for Israeli passengers. As for North American passengers, United Airlines announced it will resume flying to Israel starting March 15, while Delta Airlines will resume service from New York-JFK to Tel Aviv on April 1.

At USAID, funding for terror-tied groups and internal hostility t...	Under Samantha Power, former president Joe Biden's pick to run USAID, agency officials fought pro-Israel policymaking at the State Department, often urging their colleagues at Foggy Bottom to pare down statements that praised the Jewish state. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon As the Trump administration works to shutter the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), current and former U.S. officials who worked closely with the embattled aid group say they watched for years as it funneled millions of dollars to anti-Israel advocacy groups and entities linked to terrorism. That funding caused internal friction across multiple administrations, according to those who spoke with the Washington Free Beacon. In some cases, USAID fought to conceal how taxpayer funds were spent. And when it came to Israel, officials recalled battling USAID over funding for groups that worked to undermine the Jewish state or maintained ties to terror organizations. 'For those who believe in a strong U.S.-Israel relationship, elements of USAID have been problematic for years,' said one former State Department official who worked with USAID during the Biden administration. 'There was even a lack of embarrassment among some USAID staffers about being associated with terrorist organizations.' Some of the terror-tied funding initiatives are publicly known. In November 2022, for instance, USAID awarded $100,000 to a Palestinian activist group whose leaders hailed the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a designated terror group. Just six days before Hamas's Oct. 7 assault on Israel, USAID handed $900,000 'to a terror charity in Gaza involved with the son of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.' USAID's hostilities toward the Jewish state, however, ran deeper than the agency's grantmaking. Under Samantha Power, former president Joe Biden's pick to run USAID, agency officials fought pro-Israel policymaking at the State Department, often urging their colleagues at Foggy Bottom to pare down statements that praised the Jewish state, former officials said. In 2021, during a period of conflict with Hamas, Power herself refused to meet with Israel's ambassador unless Israel reached a ceasefire with the Iran-backed terror group. The decision put Power at odds with the White House National Security Council, which had signed off on the meeting, emails obtained by the Free Beacon show. Years later, in September, Power's USAID accused Israel of deliberately blocking Gazan aid deliveries, which Hamas is known to steal for its own use and for black market sales that fund its terror activities. USAID staffers went as far as to urge the Biden State Department to end military aid to Israel. Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken rejected the request. 'They weren't even in line with some of the Biden administration's policies,' the State Department official who worked under Biden and Blinken told the Free Beacon. 'It's more than just problematic grants to anti-Israel organizations. It's also their role in the internal approval processes and statements within the administration. There's an entire bureaucratic process they're a part of. They carry out their obstructionist ideology on that front as well.' The rogue nature of USAID under Power has motivated the Trump administration's push to dismantle the agency. During his recent trip to El Salvador, Secretary of State Marco Rubio described a longstanding 'frustration' with the agency, which he called 'completely unresponsive.' The 'level of insubordination,' Rubio said, 'makes it impossible to conduct a sort of mature and serious review that I think foreign aid writ large should have.' Federal investigations lend credence to that assessment. A January memo from Inspector General Paul Martin, for example, noted that the agency 'does not maintain a comprehensive internal database of subawardees.' In other words, the foreign entities that work with a primary grantee on a USAID project often go unreported, impeding the ability of agency investigators to vet 'fraud allegations,' according to the memo. Such allegations often include the diversion of taxpayer-funded aid to terrorist organizations. In a November report, for example, Martin 'identified deliberate interference and efforts to divert humanitarian assistance' by foreign terrorist organizations, including 'systemic coercion of aid workers by FTOs' and 'FTO influence over beneficiary selection.' Those diversion efforts are particularly pronounced in Hamas-controlled Gaza. A February report from the Middle East Forum think tank found that USAID had awarded 'millions of federal dollars' to 'organizations directly in Gaza controlled by Hamas.' In one Biden-era case, USAID funded an 'educational and community center in Gaza' controlled by a local group called the Unlimited Friends Association. The association openly collaborated with Hamas, inviting the terror group's officials to its office and boasting of U.S.-funded projects in Hamas-controlled newspapers. In 2021, its director called for Jerusalem to be cleansed 'from the impurity of the Jews.' A separate report, released in January by Israeli research organization NGO Monitor, outlined millions in USAID funding for two nonprofits—Mercy Corps and American Near East Refugee Aid—that 'have closely coordinated with a Gaza-based ministry, run by a senior Hamas official identified by the U.S. Treasury Department as previously responsible for part of Hamas’ smuggling operation.' When it resumed funding for the Palestinians in 2021, the Biden State Department issued an internal warning that there was a 'high risk' Hamas would steal U.S. aid. But information about terror-tied grant recipients in Gaza and elsewhere came mostly from watchdog groups. When members of Congress pressed USAID on those grants, they were often obstructed. In a letter sent to Rubio last week, Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa) detailed USAID's 'willful sabotage of congressional oversight.' The agency, she wrote, falsely claimed that certain grants were classified in a 'desperate attempt to limit congressional oversight of public information.' Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) described similar interactions with USAID staffers. In some cases, he told the Free Beacon, USAID 'refused to disclose what groups were getting money and gave tens of millions in American cash to be distributed without American supervision.' 'Before and after Oct. 7, USAID flowed uncountable hundreds of millions of dollars toward Hamas that enabled it to launch the attack and keep battling Israel afterwards,' Cruz said. 'The full story of USAID funding Hamas is vast and much of it was done in secret.' U.S. officials involved in foreign policy emphasized in interviews with the Free Beacon that, despite its many issues, USAID does fund essential work providing medicine and other lifesaving aid. Rubio has made similar statements, expressing his desire to continue funding programs 'providing food or medicine or anything that is saving lives and is immediate and urgent.' Over time, however, 'more and more money flowed to groups and organizations whose work is contrary to the interests of the United States,' one official who has worked closely with USAID across multiple administrations told the Free Beacon. 'How bad it got is finally coming to light and there is finally transparency.' The Trump administration plans to scale back the agency by dissolving it and placing its core functions within the State Department, where roughly 600 current USAID staffers would work. The agency employed some 10,000 staffers when President Donald Trump took office last month. The overwhelming majority of those staffers were set to go on leave by midnight Saturday. A federal judge blocked the action until Feb. 14, though the decision is temporary and the case is expected to go to the Supreme Court. Democratic lawmakers have vehemently opposed the cuts, arguing that they endanger millions of vulnerable people across the globe. 'People can quibble about this or that,' the current U.S. official said of the Democratic attention surrounding USAID. 'But let's not make the perfect the enemy of the good. This is long overdue.'

‘Fake-Christian Jew-Hatred’ – Evangelical leader urges Trump to r...	Evangelical Christian leader Laurie Cardoza-Moore criticizes President Trump for posing with populist pundit Tucker Carlson, calls on White House to distance itself from those accused of antisemitism on the far-right. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News An Evangelical Christian leader and Republican activist chided the Trump administration Monday, over President Donald Trump's meeting with right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson. Over the weekend, photographs were circulated showing Trump alongside Department of Government Efficiency administrator Elon Musk and Carlson at the White House. In a statement issued Monday by the Tennessee-based Evangelical Christian group Proclaiming Justice to the Nations, the group's president and founder Laurie Cardoza-Moore, accused Carlson of antisemitism, and called on the Trump administration to distance itself from both Carlson and Candace Owens. Owens, a 35-year-old online commentator, has come under fire over her promotion of conspiracy theories and antisemitic canards, including blaming Jews for the death of pop star Michael Jackson. 'I have been inundated with calls from concerned Jews and Christians after Carlson was pictured, wearing an oversized MAGA hat, with President Trump and Elon Musk,' Cardoza-Moore said Monday. 'We the People elected President Trump, with an overwhelming majority and with a referendum, to stand with Israel and our Jewish brethren against the rise of antisemitism, anti-Israelism and anti-Zionism.' Cardoza-Moore lauded Trump's policies vis-a-vis Israel and castigated the rise of antisemitism during the Biden presidency, but expressed concern over Trump's embrace of Carlson. 'Under the Biden Administration, his policies incited violence against our Jewish communities on higher-ed and K-12 campuses, in synagogues, and places of worship.' 'Our 47th President is without any doubt Israel’s greatest friend in the White House ever, but Tucker Carlson’s anti-Semitism is appalling,' continued Cardoza-Moore, whose syndicated Focus on Israel television show reaches billions of viewers worldwide. 'Following the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, Tucker has chosen to platform Holocaust revisionists, Jew haters and fake Christian leaders on the Palestinian Authority payroll,' Cardoza-Moore said, referencing Carlson's interview with podcaster Darryl Cooper and Carlson's April 2024 interview with Munther Isaac. During his interview with Carlson, Cooper downplayed Hitler's role in the Second World War, painting Winston Churchill as the conflict's primary villain. Isaac, a Lutheran pastor from Bethlehem and ardent Palestinian nationalist, had praised the October 7th invasion of Israel prior to his appearance on Carlson's show. 'He peddles in conspiracy theories against God’s Chosen,' Cardoza-Moore said of Carlson. 'He libels the Israel Defense Forces as deliberately targeting civilians – with no basis whatsoever,' she added. Cardoza-Moore called on Trump to keep both Carlson and Owens out of the White House, calling the two 'false prophets.' 'Tucker Carlson should not be allowed anywhere near the White House. Carlson’s positions on Jews are demonic and in violation of the 9th Commandment, bearing false witness against your neighbor. America was founded upon Judeo-Christian values which have made us what we are today. We can put America First and Make America Great Again without false prophets like Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens.'

Gaza hostage’s father credits Trump with daughter’s freedom	The president’s pressure even before his inauguration was what led to the hostage deal, Eitan Gonen wrote. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Romi Gonen’s father gave full credit to U.S. President Donald Trump for his daughter’s freedom and asked him to continue his efforts so that all the remaining hostages come home as well, in an op-ed he wrote in The New York Post Saturday. 'The person who made seeing my daughter possible, after so many months of despair and failed negotiations, was President Donald Trump,' Eitan Gonen averred. 'When he set a Jan. 20 deadline for the deal, it applied the necessary pressure, setting in motion the events that would bring Romi home,' he continued, adding that he would be 'honored' to one day shake the president’s hand 'and express my gratitude for his role in reuniting our family.' Gonen then begged the president to continue his efforts for those still in Hamas’ and other terror groups’ hands in Gaza. 'For the 79 hostages still in captivity as of Friday, including dozens who aren’t even part of the current phase of negotiations, President Trump is their only hope,' he continued. 'Only he could help other families experience the reunion I had. Only he can make the next stages of the deal possible.' Romi was freed along with Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari on January 19 in the first of six scheduled weekly exchanges of hostages for Palestinian security prisoners during a ceasefire whose negotiations had lasted for months before Trump’s November victory in the American elections. The second stage of the negotiations, for the younger, live, male hostages, including IDF soldiers and foreign nationals, with Hamas demanding more prisoners’ freedom and a complete withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza in return, are beginning now in Qatar. There is tremendous pressure from much of the Israeli public for a deal to be inked, especially after the release Saturday of three hostages, Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy and Eli Sharabi, who were emaciated, very pale and shaky on their legs. Many Jews and non-Jews had the same thoughts when seeing their gaunt frames, and President Trump put it very clearly. 'I watched the hostages come back today,' he said, 'and they looked like Holocaust survivors. They were in horrible condition' and looking '25 years older.' While not going into detail about what he meant, he said repeatedly, 'I don’t know how much longer we are going to take that,' and 'At some point, we’re going to lose our patience.' Holocaust survivors told The Post Sunday that the images of Ben Ami, Levy and Sharabi brought them back to their horrific experiences in the concentration camps. 'It’s a sorry sight to look at, and even sorrier we have to discuss it,' said 97-year-old Aron Krell, who survived several brutal German camps. 'It brings back the memories you try to forget, but you can’t forget.' 'When I saw their pictures coming out of captivity, they looked so emaciated and so sick,' he said. 'And the world doesn’t care. I can’t understand — where is the outrage?' Another nonagenarian survivor who also spoke to the New York paper, Lucy Lipiner, wrote on X, ''The horrible images of the hostages pale and starved that were released yesterday brought me back to a very dark time in my life.' 'I saw almost skeletal men walking,' she added. 'The worst thing about them was the depression that was written on their faces – the hollowed cheeks, sunken-in faces… can you imagine this emotional torture, on top of physical torture?' 'The three men look like they came out from Auschwitz.'

Erdogan accuses US of bowing to ‘Zionist lobby’ on Gaza	Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also rejected the plan earlier on Sunday, calling it historically ignorant. By JNS Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza and rebuild the area, calling it unworthy of discussion and driven by pressure from the 'Zionist lobby.' Gaza, Judea and Samaria and eastern Jerusalem rightfully belong to the Palestinians, he said. 'I would like to state this clearly once: The proposals put forward by the new American administration regarding Gaza with the pressure of the Zionist lobby have nothing worth considering or discussing from our perspective,' Erdogan told reporters at Istanbul Airport before boarding a flight to Malaysia for an official visit. 'These are purely preoccupations with nonsense. No one has the power to remove the people of Gaza from their eternal homeland that has been around for thousands of years,' he continued. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also rejected the plan earlier on Sunday, calling it historically ignorant. 'The displacement of Palestinians is unacceptable,' said Fidan. Ankara has been among Jerusalem’s fiercest critics during the war, cutting trade ties and drawing comparisons between Israel’s actions and those of Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. Erdogan even hinted at military action against the Jewish state. Turkey joins other Arab and Muslim-majority countries in rejecting Trump’s proposal, made during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington last week, that would see the U.S. take control of Gaza, resettle its Palestinian population elsewhere and transform the enclave. On Sunday, Trump said that 'Hamas has been a disaster,' blaming the terrorist group for making Gaza one of the 'most dangerous places in the world.' Despite their statements to the contrary, Arab nations would be open to resettling Gazans elsewhere once they were negotiating directly with him, Trump said during a press gaggle on Air Force One as he headed to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl. 'They never spoke to me. They spoke to other people. When they speak to me, they’re going to take them,' he claimed.

Israel’s largest-ever business delegation heads to India to boost...	Trade between Israel and India continues to grow, with total trade volume reaching approximately $5.01 billion in 2024. By Pesach Benson, TPS Led by Minister of Economy and Industry Nir Barkat, Israel’s largest business delegation of its kind departed on Monday for India. The two-day visit aims to strengthen economic ties between the two nations, expand trade opportunities, and foster technological collaboration. The delegation’s departure marks a new phase in the growing economic relationship between Israel and India. 'The departure of the economic delegation to India is a significant step towards deepening economic ties between the countries, strengthening the Israeli economy through significant growth in exports and lowering the cost of living through expanding imports,' said Barkat. 'At the invitation of Indian Economy Minister Piyush Goyal, we are embarking on a journey that will open new markets, increase trade, and remove barriers for Israeli industry. The combination of Israeli innovation and the vast Indian market constitutes a tremendous growth engine for the Israeli economy, and we are committed to leveraging it for the benefit of the Israeli public and economy,' Barkat said. During the visit, key events include the Israel-India Business Forum, attended by economy ministers and senior government officials, and the 'Bridge to Growth' panel on economic cooperation. Business-to-business meetings will take place, facilitating connections between companies from both countries. Professional tours of innovation and industry hubs, including India Energy Week 2025, will offer insights into India’s growing economic landscape. The delegation will focus on strategic areas, including agriculture and water technologies, cyber and information security, digital health, renewable energy, Industry 4.0, and smart transportation. Israeli companies specializing in these fields will explore opportunities to collaborate with Indian counterparts, leveraging their expertise to contribute to India’s economic growth. 'India is a top-notch strategic destination for Israeli companies, and the current delegation is an exceptional opportunity to expand trade and technology ties between the countries,' said Avi Balashnikov, Chairman of Israel’s Export Institute. Trade between Israel and India continues to grow, with total trade volume reaching approximately $5.01 billion in 2024. Exports from Israel to India amounted to around $2.39 billion, while imports from India to Israel stood at approximately $1.42 billion. Diamond trade between the two countries accounted for an additional $1.2 billion. Key Israeli exports include transportation products, chemicals, medical devices, and agricultural products. Another key topic of discussion will be expanding cooperation to bring professional manpower from India to Israel under fair employment conditions. Strengthening labor market ties could provide solutions to workforce shortages while ensuring mutual economic benefits for both countries. India has enormous potential to become one of Israel’s key trading partners, and advanced Israeli technologies are significant to the needs of the Indian government on its path to growth,' said Dr. Ron Tomer, President of Israel’s Manufacturers Association. 'The delegation is an opportunity for Israeli industrialists to meet Indian businesspeople and government officials, to create business connections, with the aim of turning them into commercial collaborations in the future.'

He also noted that Trump is due to meet with Jordan’s King Abdullah in the coming days, which Jordan’s state news agency has already reported. By Reuters and The Algemeiner Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on Sunday that US President Donald Trump was set to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and possibly Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, although he gave no dates for the talks. The comments, delivered in an interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, came in response to a question about Trump’s recently unveiled proposal to take over and redevelop the Gaza Strip. Herzog did not say when or where the meetings would take place, nor did he discuss their potential content. He also noted that Trump is due to meet with Jordan’s King Abdullah in the coming days, which Jordan’s state news agency has already reported. 'President Trump is due to meet with major, major Arab leaders, first and foremost the king of Jordan and the president of Egypt and I think also the crown prince of Saudi Arabia as well,' Herzog said. 'These are partners that must be listened to, they must be discussed with. We have to honor their feels as well and see how we build a plan that is sustainable for the future,' Herzog said. Saudi Arabia has flatly rejected Trump’s Gaza plan, as have many world leaders. Jordan’s King Abdullah plans to tell Trump during their planned Feb. 11 meeting in Washington that the proposal is a recipe for radicalism that will spread chaos through the Middle East and jeopardize the kingdom’s peace with Israel, Reuters reported earlier this week. The White House did not immediately respond to comment. It was not immediately possible to contact officials in Cairo and Riyadh.

Israel hits Syria-Lebanon arms smuggling tunnel	Additionally, the IAF struck Hezbollah sites in Lebanon containing munitions and rocket launchers that posed an 'imminent threat.' By JNS The Israeli Air Force on Sunday carried out a precision strike on a tunnel that according to the Israeli military was used by Hezbollah to smuggle weapons from Syria to Lebanon. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the tunnel in the Beqaa Valley had been struck previously, and was targeted again to prevent its restoration. Additionally, the IAF struck Hezbollah sites in Lebanon containing munitions and rocket launchers that posed an 'imminent threat,' according to the IDF. The IDF emphasized that these targets violated the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire and reaffirmed its commitment to preventing Hezbollah’s rearmament while upholding the truce. Israel on Saturday attacked Hezbollah forces in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon and a facility in southern Syria belonging to the Gaza-based Hamas terrorist organization.

Poll: Americans back Trump’s Israel policies – but few support Ga...	New poll shows few Americans believe Trump is sincere about his Gaza relocation plan while a plurality of Israelis believe Trump's plan could realistically be implemented. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Americans and Israelis are deeply divided over President Donald Trump's Gaza resettlement plan, with a wide gap between the two populations regarding perceptions of the proposal's viability. Last Tuesday, President Trump held a joint press conference in the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During the press conference, Trump announced plans to permanently resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip - officially listed by the Palestinian Authority at over 2.2 million, though some estimates place it as low as 1.7 million - to third-party countries. The plan was panned by leaders across the Arab world, with the foreign ministries of five European powers also distancing themselves from the proposal. The Israeli government, however, and a number of Republican lawmakers hailed the plan, with Prime Minister Netanyahu calling it the 'first good idea' he has heard on the issue of the post-war handling of the Gaza Strip. On Sunday, CBS News published a poll, conducted by YouGov, which surveyed 2,175 American adults from February 5th through the 7th, polling respondents on their views regarding Trump's job performance and specific issues, including his Gaza plan. A majority of 53% said they approve of his job performance thus far, and 59% back his program to deport large numbers of illegal immigrants from the U.S. Even more (64%) say they support deploying troops to the border with Mexico to rein in illegal border crossings. Fifty-four percent said they support Trump's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, but just 13% said they think Trump's plan to assume control over the Gaza Strip is a 'good idea.' Nearly half (47%) said it was a 'bad idea,' while 40% were unsure. In a separate poll, a plurality (47%) of Israelis say Trump's Gaza plan is realistic, compared to (38%) who say it is not, with 15% expressing no opinion. The poll, conducted by the Lazar Research Institute, found that respondents who said they voted for parties in the coalition government were far more likely to say Trump's plan was realistic than voters who backed parties in the opposition, with 78% of coalition voters saying the plan could be implemented, while 58% of opposition voters said it could not be.

Super Bowl halftime show performer detained over Palestinian flag	Neither the NFL nor the entertainment production company knew of the stunt ahead of time. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A backup performer flew a combined Sudanese and Palestinian flag during one of the shows put on at half time at the Super Bowl Sunday before running onto the field and being detained by police. The flags share the same colors, and the word 'Sudan' was written on the Sudanese half while 'Gaza' was written on the Palestinian half, with a heart painted in front of each name. The man, who was later confirmed to be part of the production cast of hundreds dancing while singer Kendrick Lamar performed, pulled it out of his pocket during Lamar’s last song. He held it up while standing on top of a car that was on the stage as part of the set. After waving it briefly, he jumped off the car and off the stage and ran around the sidelines of the football field waving the flag for several seconds before three security guards tackled him. They were joined by several others and dragged him quickly off the field. At no point was the performance stopped because of the stunt. In a statement, the Roc Nation entertainment company that produced the halftime show, which is watched by millions during the long intermission between halves of the championship game, said that the man’s act 'was neither planned nor part of the production and was never in any rehearsal.' The National Football League also said that 'the individual hid the item on his person and unveiled it late in the show' and that 'no one involved with the production was aware of the individual’s intent.' The league praised the security personnel 'for quickly detaining the individual who displayed the flag.' The New Orleans police said in a statement that 'law enforcement is working to determine applicable charges in this incident.' According to AP, one punishment had already been decided upon, as it reported that NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that the protestor would be 'banned for life from all NFL stadiums and events' as a result. By displaying simultaneous support for both Gaza and Sudan, the man was seemingly showing that he backed both the Hamas terror organization in the Strip and the Houthi terrorist group that has taken over most of the North African country in a bloody civil war. The Houthis have showed their support for their fellow Iranian proxy during the 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas by periodically launching missiles at the Jewish state as well as at cargo ships going toward Israel and the Suez Canal, endangering a major international shipping lane.

Next US ambassador to Israel hints at changes of ‘biblical propor...	Former Governor Mike Huckabee, nominated as US Ambassador to Israel, says Hamas 'cannot exist,' lauds Trump's Gaza relocation plan. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump's nominee for the next Ambassador to Israel commended the president's proposed Gaza resettlement plan, and suggested that the president's second term in the White House could lead to geopolitical changes in the Middle East of 'biblical proportions.' On Sunday, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who has been tapped to serve as Trump's envoy to the Jewish state - pending his confirmation by the U.S. Senate - spoke with Fox News' Mario Bartiromo about the future of the Gaza Strip and the Middle East as a whole, following Trump's unveiling last Tuesday of his Gaza plan. 'I’m personally optimistic that we’re going to see something bold,' Huckabee said. 'I will use this term, Maria: I think we will see something of biblical proportion happen with his leadership in the Middle East.' The former governor, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and has in the past expressed opposition to Palestinian statehood, excoriated the Hamas terror organization, citing its record after seizing control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, less than two years after Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005. 'A lot of people forget that Gaza was once a place inhabited by both Jews and Palestinians, until 2005 when Ariel Sharon decided to give it all away,' continued Huckabee. 'He did. They militarily marched 10,000 Jewish people out of Gaza. Turned it into a complete Palestinian state, and the result we saw was [the Hamas-led attack on] Oct. 7th.' 'President Trump did something bold. He looked into the future and said kind of a what if. We don’t know exactly what might happen in Gaza, but here’s what could have happened in Gaza: Gaza could have been Singapore. Instead, Hamas turned it into Haiti. And in fact, maybe worse, far worse than that.' Hamas, Huckabee added, 'is not going to be able to exist,' saying the terror group's dismantling is a 'done deal.' Huckabee went on to laud Trump's Middle East policies during his first term in office, while backing his plan to facilitate mass migration out of the Gaza Strip. 'The only time we’ve had real, significant peace in that region was the four years that Donald Trump was president, and I’m very optimistic that with his leadership, his bold and innovative thinking—he doesn’t think like the other politicians and diplomats have thought, and thank God he doesn’t because we get results.' He throws the box away and says, let’s start with a blank slate and see where this could go. That’s leadership, and that’s what we have with President Trump.'

‘Powerful offensive in Judea and Samaria will continue’ – IDF chi...	The monthlong Islamic festival is often marked by an uptick in terror attacks in Israel, particularly in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff Outgoing Israeli army Chief-of-Staff pledged that the military would continue its 'powerful offensive' against terrorists in Judea and Samaria during an IDF exercise on Sunday. In late January 2025, the IDF launched Operation Iron Wall, a widescale counter-terror operation in Palestinian Authority-controlled enclaves within Judea and Samaria. The operation began as Israel released thousands of convicted terrorists from detention facilities, as part of a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal with the Hamas terror group. 'Looking ahead at the challenges in Judea and Samaria, we will maintain a strong and aggressive approach' towards rooting out terror in the region, HaLevi said to troops. 'Entering areas like Nur a-Shams, the Jenin refugee camp, and terror centers in Tulkarem, Hebron, and Sa'ir a-Shuyuh — whether to disrupt terrorist plans early or to prevent terrorists from carrying out imminent attacks — is the most effective strategy' for protecting Israel, HaLevi said. 'This effort must continue, and you are carrying it out with great precision and effectiveness.' HaLevi spoke to soldiers during a drill testing the operational readiness of the IDF's Central Command. According to an army media statement, the exercise simulated numerous responses to a number of potential scenarios involving national security. The statement noted that the army is stepping up its operational readiness ahead of the Islamic holiday of Ramadan, which begins in late February. The monthlong Islamic festival is often marked by an uptick in terror attacks in Israel, particularly in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria. The release of thousands of security prisoners to eastern Jerusalem and PA-controlled municipalities in Judea and Samaria has raised concerns about a potential wave of terror targeting Israeli civilians. In recent years, PA-controlled communities have been flooded with Iranian weapons, smuggled in from Jordan, adding to the security risks.

Ben-Gvir: ‘Stop providing humanitarian aid, fuel to Gaza’	We’ve become the joke of the Middle East - I’m not sure we even realize it yet,' said Otzma Yehudit Chair Itamar Ben-Gvir. By World Israel News Staff Former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who resigned from the government with his Otzma Yehduit party over the approval of the ceasefire and hostage deal, is urging Israel to adopt a harsher stance towards Hamas in order to secure a decisive victory in the Gaza Strip. Ben-Gvir has been highly critical of Israel's practice of permitting the entry of humanitarian aid and fuel into the Strip, citing the fact that the vast majority of these supplies are usurped by Hamas. Speaking to radio station Kol BaRama on Sunday, Ben-Gvir said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had caved to pressure from the U.S. over the humanitarian crisis in the Strip, to the detriment of Israel's war aims. 'It’s not easy to stand up to the U.S. president, but I would expect the prime minister to stand by our truth,' Ben-Gvir said. He appeared to be referencing President Donald Trump's ultimatum that Israel agree to the ceasefire, which some have argued includes unfavorable terms for the Jewish State. 'We’ve become the joke of the Middle East - I’m not sure we even realize it yet,' he continued. 'A country doesn’t supply fuel to its enemy and provide humanitarian aid that ends up in Hamas’s hands - those who voted [to do so] knew exactly what they were doing.' Ben-Gvir has enthusiastically supported Trump's proposal to resettle Gazans outside of the Strip while the war-torn territory is rebuilt. But, Ben-Gvir stressed that he disagreed with Trump's recent statement that he is 'not in a rush' to implement the plan. 'We need to launch an initiative [as soon as] today to encourage voluntary migration,' Ben-Gvir told Kol BaRama. 'Trump says there is time, but [from Israel's perspective] there is no time,' he added. Ben-Gvir concluded the interview by reiterating the importance of ousting Hamas from power in the Strip, which is one of the stated goals of the war. He said that his Otzma Yehudit party would not re-join the government 'until we move toward toppling Hamas.'

Trump: ‘Freed Israeli hostages looked like Holocaust survivors’	Trump says that the U.S. is 'going to lose our patience' if Hamas abuse of captives continues. By World Israel News Staff President Donald J. Trump acknowledged the poor condition of recently released Israeli hostages on Sunday, saying that they resembled Holocaust survivors and that Hamas was testing the U.S.'s patience by mistreating captives. Speaking to the media aboard Air Force One, Trump said he was concerned by the apparent starvation endured by Or Levy, Ohad Ben-Ami, and Eli Sharabi, who were released on Saturday by the terror group. 'They were in horrible condition, they were emaciated, and I don’t know how much longer we can take that,' Trump said. The three Israelis 'look like they haven’t had a meal in a month,' Trump continued, adding that they are 'people that were healthy people a reasonably short number of years ago, and you look at them today, they look like they’ve aged 25 years, they literally look like the old pictures of Holocaust survivors, the same thing. No reason for that.' I watched the hostages come back today. And they looked like Holocaust surivors. They were in horrible condition. They were emacitated. It looked like many years ago the Holocaust survivors. I don't know how much longer we can take that&#8230;We're going to lose our patience'- Trump pic.twitter.com/axyUrhlzPG &mdash; Howard Mortman (@HowardMortman) February 9, 2025 Trump appeared to imply that Hamas' abuse of hostages could potentially endanger the ceasefire agreement. The hostages 'are in really bad shape, they have been treated brutally, horribly,' he said. Referencing captives who were released earlier in the deal, Trump notes that even as they 'they were in a little bit better shape [physically,] but mentally they were treated so badly. Who could take that? 'You know, at some point, we’re gonna lose our patience,' he added. The condition of Israeli hostages released in the deal has become progressively worse as the ceasefire continues. The first few batches of hostages freed appeared to be in relatively good health, but the last two weeks have seen the release of captives who are visibly starved. Negotiations for the next phase of the ceasefire and hostage exchange deal are currently ongoing in Qatar. During that stage, the Israeli army is expected to commit to a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, along with the release of thousands of convicted terrorists from prison.

Elizabeth Pipko: Trump and Netanyahu—The Best Duo to Take on War ...	When it comes to bringing peace to people in Israel and in Gaza, a shift away from the status quo could be the only solution to this never-ending crisis.' By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News For those unfamiliar, Elizabeth Pipko is no ordinary political figure. A first-generation American, she was raised in a proud Jewish and Zionist household with deep roots in the struggle for Jewish identity and survival. At just 21, she started as a volunteer on Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign before quickly being hired full-time. She rose through the ranks, earning two Ivy League degrees, running a Super PAC, publishing a memoir, and becoming a political commentator. In 2024, she served as the Republican Party’s spokesperson in a historic election, solidifying her role as one of Trump’s most trusted advisors, particularly on Jewish affairs and Israel policy. Trump and Netanyahu: A partnership forged in strength With the certainty of someone who had witnessed history unfold behind closed doors, Pipko stated it plainly: 'President Trump wants the same that Israel wants.' She elaborated further: 'A decisive victory over monsters, but also a decisive victory that also ends with people coming back,' she said, her words weighted by the knowledge that, at that very moment, Israeli hostages were still being held in Hamas’s tunnels. When discussing Trump’s relationship with Netanyahu, she left no room for doubt. 'I’m not sure if there is a better duo to take on something like this than Trump and Netanyahu,' Pipko asserted. Addressing the widely discussed recent meeting between the two leaders—where Trump publicly proposed a plan for the United States to take over Gaza—Pipko didn’t hold back in her assessment. In a follow-up comment exclusive to World Israel News, she explained: 'People asked me for nearly four years why I was so confident that President Trump would again stand with Israel in a second term, as he did in his first. President Trump’s actions have always shown the world his intentions, and his actions this week were no different. It took Biden 1,293 days to welcome the leader of one of our closest allies, Israel, to the White House. For President Trump, it took 15.' It was, as Pipko had put it before, a stark contrast between a leader who understood Jewish destiny and one who treated Israel like an inconvenience. A new vision for Gaza—one that breaks the status quo The world had spent decades watching Gaza spiral into chaos. Politicians had come and gone, diplomats had sat at long tables discussing two-state solutions that never materialized, and the cycle of war and terror had continued unabated. But, according to Pipko, Trump wasn’t interested in maintaining a failed status quo. 'The fact is, Donald Trump is back in the White House because he is and always has been a breath of fresh air after the American people dealt with politician after politician who promised results and never delivered,' she said. 'When it comes to bringing peace to people in Israel and in Gaza, a shift away from the status quo could be the only solution to this never-ending crisis.' No vague platitudes. No meaningless calls for 'both sides' to show restraint. Just an understanding that history favored those who took decisive action. The fight against antisemitism: No room for negotiation The battle for Israel wasn’t just being fought on its borders. It was unfolding in the streets of New York, on Ivy League campuses, and in the halls of Congress, where lawmakers openly defended Hamas while claiming to be 'just anti-Zionist.' And Trump? He had no patience for it. Pipko made that abundantly clear when discussing the former president’s decision to cancel the visas of foreign students who support Hamas. 'He believes that if you stand in the United States and you support a terrorist group, maybe you shouldn’t be here,' she said bluntly. And, in case there was any doubt about her stance, she doubled down. 'There is good and there is evil. Donald Trump is very black and white; he is very much to the point,' she continued. No excuses. No middle ground. Just the reality that the people who hate Jews also hate America. 'The people who hate America and everything that we stand for, those are the same people that also hate everything that Jewish people and Israel stand for,' Pipko said, her voice carrying the weight of history behind it. Because she understood something that too many Jewish leaders refused to say out loud: Antisemitism isn’t just about Jews. It’s about civilization itself. More than politics—A deeply personal fight For Pipko, this wasn’t just politics. It was personal. She had spent nearly a decade fighting for President Trump, starting as a volunteer in 2016 and becoming one of his most trusted advisors, particularly on Jewish matters. And, as she sat inside the sanctuary of Park East Synagogue, she made it clear—her Jewish identity wasn’t just a footnote in her story. It was the foundation. She spoke of the synagogue’s importance in her life, its impact on her faith, and the unbreakable link between Judaism and the fight for Jewish survival. And that fight? It wasn’t just about policy or political alliances. It was about standing with those who were willing to act. Pipko had been with President Trump on October 7, 2024, when he became the first U.S. president to visit the Ohel (the burial place of the late Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe). She wasn’t just speaking from behind a desk in Washington. She had been there, walking alongside the man who, she believed, was the only one brave enough to do what needed to be done. Final thoughts—A war that must be won Trump and Netanyahu. A decisive victory. A new future for Gaza. Pipko hadn’t just laid out a vision—she had made it clear that this was a war that had to be won. And not just by Israel, but by everyone who understood what was at stake. Because history would not remember the ones who hesitated. It would remember those who fought.

Iran’s attempts on Trump’s life were more serious than initially ...	During his 2024 campaign, officials warned Trump that Iranian terrorists had access to surface-to-air missiles and were planning to crash his private plane. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Iranian plots to assassinate U.S. President Donald Trump were more serious than initially reported, according to Axios, quoting a book by Alex Isenstadt. The author reports that during his 2024 campaign, officials warned Trump that Iranian terrorists had access to surface-to-air missiles and were planning to crash his private plane. Isenstadt said concerns grew for Trump's safety after shots were fired at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September. At one point, Trump's security team flew a decoy plane for his trip to meet with Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and most of the staff weren’t aware of it until after takeoff. 'The boss ain't riding with us today,' White House Chief of Staff Chris LaCivita told the passengers, according to Isenstadt. 'We had to put him into another plane. This is nothing but a test for how things might unfold in the future.' The aides called the decoy plane situation 'surreal' and wondered why they were being kept on the plane if there was a threat of an Iranian attack. However, they were reassured that they weren't being used as bait. Trump's security staff also received a warning of a plot to shoot at Trump's vehicle in Long Island. When Trump visited Pennsylvania, a drone following his car was shot down. Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order reinstating his 'maximum pressure' policy toward Iran. Last week, President Trump threatened to ‘obliterate’ Iran if the Islamic Republic attempted to assassinate him. Speaking with reporters while signing the sanctions order, Trump said that he had instructed his administration to devastate Iran in the event that he was assassinated by agents working on Tehran’s behalf. 'That would be a terrible thing for them to do,' Trump said. 'If they did that, they would be obliterated. That would be the end.' 'I’ve left instructions if they do it, they get obliterated, there won’t be anything left.'

Family of hostage Alon Ohel receives news he is alive, but wounde...	Alon Ohel's family: 'While we are relieved and emotional to learn that Alon is alive, we are devastated and shocked by his severe physical and mental condition.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The family of hostage Alon Ohel reported on Sunday that they have received signs of life, though there are also indications that he is wounded, untreated, and suffering in extreme conditions in captivity. The family released a statement urging the release of the remaining hostages and noted that Alon would spend his 24th birthday in Hamas captivity. They wrote, 'Tomorrow, Alon will spend his 24th birthday in Hamas captivity. We urge the prime minister, the cabinet, and the Israeli government—time is running out. The second phase of the deal must move forward to bring all the hostages home. It is your moral obligation to do everything possible to save Alon and the others.' Ohel, who was attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7, 2023, was kidnapped from the 'death shelter' in Re'im, where Hersh Goldberg-Polin lost his arm to a grenade before being taken hostage. Or Levy, who was released on Saturday, was abducted from the shelter along with Eliya Cohen. Ohel's family was informed that he was being held in tunnels alongside recently freed hostages and that he had a wounded eye but was not receiving adequate medical treatment. Along with other hostages, Ohel is being mistreated and suffering from severe malnutrition. The family's statement continued, 'While we are relieved and emotional to learn that Alon is alive, we are devastated and shocked by his severe physical and mental condition, as well as the ongoing abuse he and the other hostages endure.' It continued, 'Alon has survived this nightmare so far, but he is out of time. The release of the hostages cannot be delayed—they are all humanitarian cases!' 'We all sat in tears on Saturday, watching our dear brothers finally freed after their prolonged ordeal. We urge our leaders to take the necessary humanitarian action to rescue Alon and the other victims from the suffering they continue to endure,' they said.

‘Joe, you’re fired,’ Trump’s cuts off Biden’s intelligence access	Trump’s been on what his critics might call a revenge spree, targeting anyone who’s crossed him. By Jewish Breaking News President Donald Trump is not done with his predecessor just yet, having removed Joe Biden’s access to the nation’s most closely guarded secrets as political payback. 'There is no need for Joe Biden to continue receiving access to classified information. Therefore, we are immediately revoking Joe Biden’s Security Clearances and stopping his daily Intelligence Briefings,' Trump wrote on Truth Social after he arrived at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida for the weekend. 'He set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents.' Channeling his old reality TV catchphrase, Trump finished off with 'JOE, YOU’RE FIRED!' Biden’s decision to cut off Trump’s intelligence briefings came in February 2021, just weeks after the January 6 Capitol attack. It marked a sharp break from the longstanding tradition of former presidents receiving intelligence briefings after leaving office. At the time, Biden cited Trump’s role in inciting the riot and his persistent efforts to overturn the 2020 election results as evidence of 'erratic behavior' that made him unfit to receive sensitive intelligence. 'I just think that there is no need for him to have the intelligence briefings,' Biden told CBS News. 'What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?' But this isn’t just a one-off act of settling old scores. Trump’s been on what his critics might call a revenge spree, targeting anyone who’s crossed him. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, who helped coordinate the Justice Department’s response to the January 6 Capitol attack, saw her protective services revoked. Mike Pompeo, his former Secretary of State, has lost his security detail despite facing active threats from Iran. Similarly, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who frequently challenged Trump’s pandemic policies, was also targeted. Others caught in Trump’s retaliatory sweep include some of Biden’s highest-ranking officials. Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and former National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan both saw their security clearances stripped away. Taking aim at his prosecutors, Trump also revoked clearances from New York AG Letitia James and Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, who dragged his business empire and personal conduct into court.

Footage reveals Gazans violated ceasefire by approaching Israel’s...	Defense Minister Katz: 'Israel's security stance on Gaza remains firm: Anyone entering the buffer zone does so at their own risk.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Footage published on social media on Sunday showed Gazans approaching the border with Israel, violating the ceasefire agreement that requires a 700-meter buffer zone. The video showed Gazan civilians near Kibbutz Nahal Oz, prompting the IDF to fire shots into the crowd. Gazan media reported that three people were killed in the shooting. The IDF stated that it fired warning shots in multiple areas of Gaza. Defense Minister Israel Katz commented on the incident on Sunday night, saying, 'Israel's security stance on Gaza remains firm: Anyone entering the buffer zone does so at their own risk.' 'There will be no tolerance for those who pose a threat to IDF forces, the border region, or nearby communities. We will not allow a repeat of the events of October 7,' he continued. 'IDF troops acted appropriately today in identifying and neutralizing the threat, and this approach will continue. The IDF is fully prepared for any scenario and will respond decisively to any danger,' Katz stated. The IDF has cautioned Palestinians against approaching the Israeli border and the buffer zone within Gaza, where its troops are stationed. In a separate incident on Sunday, a Palestinian woman was reportedly killed east of the Al-Qarara suburb in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. During the latest round of hostage negotiations, Israel secured an agreement to maintain a buffer zone along its border with Gaza. Before Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, the IDF had established a 300-meter (0.186-mile) no-man’s land along the border. While there was no permanent Israeli presence in this buffer zone, the IDF warned that any entry would be considered a hostile act and could be met with live fire. In the aftermath of the invasion, Israel began expanding the buffer zone, demolishing buildings on the Gaza side of the border and creating a roughly 1.5-kilometer (0.93-mile) sterile zone.

War disruptions lead to 13% rise in Israeli fresh produce imports...	The months from January to April saw the highest import volumes due to intense fighting and damage to frontline agricultural areas. By Pesach Benson, TPS Due to the war, Israeli imports of fresh vegetables rose 13 percent in 2024, the Agriculture Ministry reported on Sunday. Approximately 227,000 tons of fresh agricultural produce were imported, reflecting a 13% rise compared to 2023. This increase was necessary to compensate for damage to local production, labor shortages, and operational difficulties in frontline agricultural areas. Since October 7, the war 'posed an unprecedented challenge' to the 'continuity of the supply chain,' Agriculture Ministry Director General Oren Lavie said. 'Alongside the concern for full shelves in the marketing chains, we continue to invest in strengthening local production, out of a commitment to ensuring agricultural stability and food security in the years to come.' Despite disruptions, the government remains committed to increasing local agricultural production by 30% over the next decade. The five leading imported products — apples, onions, tomatoes, garlic, and pineapples — accounted for 75% of total imports. However, there was a decline in tomato and cucumber imports. The imported produce came from 30 countries, including Italy, the United States, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Spain, China, and Poland. The months from January to April saw the highest import volumes due to intense fighting and damage to frontline agricultural areas. January recorded the highest import volume at 33,000 tons, followed by March, February, and April. Apple imports rose by 58% to 60,000 tons in 2024. The increase was attributed to difficulties in tending and harvesting orchards in northern communities near the Lebanese border. Apples were imported from 16 countries, with most coming from Italy, followed by the United States, Argentina, Greece, Moldova, and Spain. Onion imports doubled to 57,000 tons due to reduced local yields caused by propagation issues and disease. Most of the imported onions came from the Netherlands, which quadrupled its exports to Israel. Other sources included Turkey, China, Spain, and Greece. Tomato imports decreased by 35% to 30,000 tons. Early in the year, imports increased significantly as the war affected tomato production in the Negev. Jordan and Turkey were the primary suppliers, but exports from these countries ceased in mid-2024, leading to diversification of import sources. By December, only 100 tons of tomatoes were imported, as local production recovered. Garlic imports rose 30% to 13,000 tons due to 2022 tariff reductions impacting local production. Most came from China, with some from Jordan and Spain. Pineapple imports increased 64% to 10,000 tons, mainly from Costa Rica, with smaller amounts from Kenya and the Dominican Republic. Cucumber imports fell over 50% to 7,708 tons due to supply losses from Jordan, Turkey, and Gaza. In January, Israel and Thailand finalized an agreement to bring 13,000 Thai workers to work in farms, orchards, greenhouses and packing plants. There are currently more than 42,000 foreign workers working in Israeli agriculture, around 10,000 more than pre-war levels.

IDF expands northern Samaria operation to Nur al-Shams Camp	As of the latest Israel Defense Forces update, around 50 terrorists have been killed and more than 100 wanted suspects arrested since the operation began. By JNS Israel’s military has expanded its 'Iron Wall' counter-terrorism operation to the Nur al-Shams camp near Tulkarem in northern Samaria, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Sunday. 'We are crushing terrorist infrastructure in the refugee camps and preventing its return. We will not allow the Iranian axis of evil to establish an eastern terror front that threatens the settlements in Samaria, the seam line, and large population centers in Israel,' Katz tweeted. The move represents a further expansion of the operation, which began in the Jenin area on Jan. 21, with Israeli forces also targeting the area east of Jenin that includes Tubas, Tammun, Tayasir, Aqabah and Far’a. As of the latest Israel Defense Forces update, around 50 terrorists have been killed and more than 100 wanted suspects arrested since the operation began. As part of the latest wave of arrests in Jenin and Tulkarem, security forces targeted financial operatives, including money changers funding bomb-making, recruitment and arms procurement. The ongoing security threat was underscored on Tuesday when two soldiers were killed and eight others wounded in a terrorist shooting in northern Samaria. Despite the attack, 'Iron Wall' continues at full force, with IDF Central Command emphasizing that 'this attack only reinforces the operation’s necessity.' Over the past month, Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) agents, working alongside the IDF, have thwarted 90 major terrorist attacks, including 75 in Samaria, as security sources warn that Iran is fueling violence in Judea and Samaria. A security official identified Tehran as a central force escalating tensions by supplying weapons and financial aid to terrorist networks, significantly increasing the security threat, Israel’s Channel 12 News reported on Wednesday. The military has also announced plans to form a new battalion that will remain in the Jenin and Tulkarem areas beyond the duration of the operation.

Chief Prosecutor Khan first on US ICC sanctions blacklist	Khan, who is British, paid a visit to New York as recently as Jan. 27 to brief the U.N. Security Council on Sudan. By JNS Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has become the first person working for the court to be subjected to economic and travel sanctions by the Trump administration, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday directing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to submit a report within 60 days naming people who should be sanctioned. Khan’s name was designated in an annex a day later, which was not yet made public, according to the report. Those blacklisted are barred from entry into the U.S., along with their families, and their U.S. assets are frozen. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who met last week with Trump in the White House, praised the move during a visit to Congress on Friday. He called the ICC 'scandalous,' saying it 'threatens the right of all democracies to defend themselves.' In November, the court issued arrest warrants for the Israeli premier and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes committed in Gaza. Trump’s move targeting the Hague-based ICC over its investigations of U.S. citizens and U.S. allies is a repeat of a measure he took during his first term, when in June 2020 he ordered economic and travel sanctions against International Criminal Court employees involved in an investigation into whether U.S. troops committed war crimes in Afghanistan. The tribunal on Friday decried the sanctions, vowing to back its staff and 'continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world, in all situations before it,' Reuters reported. Two-thirds of the court’s member states, 79 in total, issued a joint statement warning that the U.S. measure could 'threaten to erode the international rule of law.' It added, 'Sanctions would severely undermine all situations currently under investigation as the Court may have to close its field offices.' Khan, who is British, paid a visit to New York as recently as Jan. 27 to brief the U.N. Security Council on Sudan. As the chief prosecutor is a frequent traveler to New York, U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said on Friday that 'we trust that any restrictions taken against individuals would be implemented consistently with the host country’s obligations under the U.N. Headquarters agreement.' Trump’s order from Thursday includes a declaration of a national emergency to respond to the court’s 'unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. 'The ICC’s recent actions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces, by exposing them to harassment, abuse and possible arrest,' the order states. Neither the United States nor Israel is a member of the court, which is a stand-alone entity and is not part of the United Nations. Both Washington and Jerusalem assert that they are not subject to the tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Israeli delegation arrives in Doha for ceasefire talks	Israel's Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing has reportedly raised objections with mediators regarding the poor physical condition of released hostages. By JNS An Israeli delegation arrived in Doha, Qatar on Saturday night to continue the negotiations on the ceasefire with Hamas. U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is mediating the latest round of talks. The working-level team includes Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig. Gen. (res.) Gal Hirsch and officials from the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet), Mossad and Israel Defense Forces. They were authorized to travel to the Qatari capital for technical discussions following the Gaza-based terrorist group’s release of three hostages and Israel’s release of 183 Palestinian terrorists on Saturday under the first phase of the truce. The Israeli Security Cabinet will convene on Monday to determine the negotiation team’s mandate, according to Hebrew media reports. Hirsch expressed anger over the poor physical condition of the three hostages released on Saturday, saying that Israel has raised objections with mediators and will respond accordingly. Jerusalem is evaluating the possibility of reducing aid shipments into Gaza, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. According to Israeli estimates, there are 76 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 73 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks.

Israeli president blasts BBC for comparing hostages to Hamas terr...	We are a democracy' - Israel's president castigates the BBC, accusing the media giant of drawing an 'outrageous' false equivalence between Israeli hostages and convicted Hamas terrorists jailed in Israel. By World Israel News Staff Israeli President Isaac Herzog appeared on the BBC Sunday morning to sharply criticize the British media giant over its coverage of the ongoing Gaza hostage deal, accusing the broadcaster of equating Israeli captives with Palestinian terrorists jailed in Israel. In an interview on the BBC's 'Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg,' Herzog said the outlet falsely suggested Israel mistreated convicted terrorists, drawing a false equivalence between the terrorists freed by Israel during the ceasefire with the Israeli hostages released by the Islamic terror group. 'I absolutely reject that, and I think that this equality that the BBC is always trying to make is outrageous and preposterous, absolutely not true,' Herzog said. 'We are a democracy. We abide by the rule of law. All prisoners in Israel get whatever is necessary as prisoners under the law, under the supervision of the court, even a Supreme Court justice recently visited the prisons.' 'And not only that, some of the prisoners, the Palestinians, didn't want to leave. They didn't want to go back to Gaza. They preferred staying in the Israeli prisons.' 'So of course, there's always this notion by the BBC, which is really outrageous in my mind, and I call upon all of you to stop that attitude and understand that this attack on October 7, was an attack on the entire free world, and what we are doing when we are catching terrorists who carried out these atrocities, we are simply preventing them from taking on further attacks against humanity at large,' Herzog continued. Herzog also highlighted the conditions under which the 76 remaining hostages are being held in the Gaza Strip, citing reports of hostages being kept in underground tunnels for months, deprived of adequate food and medical care, and suffering severe physical and emotional trauma. 'They were kept in tunnels throughout that period. They had no contact with the outside world. They hardly ate.' 'They became totally emaciated, and they have suffered a huge amount of bruises, pains and wounds, and of course, we haven't discussed the mental situation, but we are all shocked and horrified as we saw them emerging out of those terrible captivity tunnels of the brutal terrorists of Hamas.' Asked to respond to President Donald Trump’s recently unveiled Gaza plan, Herzog avoided directly commenting on the proposal,' saying only that he supported 'new ideas.' 'I would say that President Trump basically came forward and said something which I read as follows: Going back to the same routine of getting to a ceasefire – an arrangement and a Hamas attacks you, and then we go to war, and then terrible things happen – cannot go on.' We have to look for new ideas. And I believe that after he met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, now President Trump will meet with President El-Sisi of Egypt, with King Abdullah of Jordan.' 'I'm sure that they will have to express their views on the issue, and of course, they are our partners in peace processes, including the Abraham Accords partners, we’ll hear all of them, and we'll have to find a right way to make sure that what happened will not recur again, meaning that Hamas cannot rule Gaza anymore.'

Saudis respond to Netanyahu proposal to create Palestinian state ...	The Saudis can create a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia; they have plenty of land over there,' said Netanyahu. By World Israel News Staff The Saudi government rebuffed suggestions last week that it use its own territory to facilitate the establishment of a Palestinian state. On Sunday, the Saudi Foreign Ministry issued a page-long statement rejecting comments by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made last week during an interview with Israel's Channel 14, during which the prime minister said, possibly intended as a joke, that Saudi Arabia itself furnish the land for a future Palestinian state. 'The Saudis can create a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia; they have plenty of land over there,' Netanyahu said, in response to the oil-rich Sunni kingdom's recent statements linking normalization of ties with Israel to Palestinian statehood. Netanyahu went on to reiterate his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria. In response, Riyadh issued a 'categorical rejection' of 'what Benjamin Netanyahu stated regarding the displacement of the Palestinian people from their land.' The Saudi foreign ministry also condemned what it called the 'continuous crimes committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian brothers in Gaza, including the ethnic cleansing they are subjected to.' 'The Kingdom affirms that the Palestinian people have a right to their land, and they are not intruders or immigrants to it who can be expelled whenever the brutal Israeli occupation wishes.' The statement echoed Saudi Arabia's insistence that any comprehensive deal with Israel include Jerusalem's acceptance of Palestinian statehood. 'The Kingdom also asserts that lasting peace will not be achieved except&#8230;through the two state solution.' Last week, Riyadh rejected claims by President Donald Trump on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia had privately dropped its insistence that normalization with Israel be accompanied by the establishment of a Palestinian state. The Saudis also publicly condemned Trump's Gaza plan, under which the U.S. will facilitate the mass resettlement of the Strip's entire population in third-party countries.

A closer look at the terrorists released from Israeli prisons	The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel released 183 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists on Saturday in exchange for hostages Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, and Ohad Ben Ami. The list includes 18 terrorists who were serving life sentences and 111 Palestinians from Gaza who were detained during the war. Here is a closer look at some of the terrorists who were freed. Falah Ratib Shahadeh, a Fatah figure who was servinga 27-year sentence for carrying out shooting attacks, planting bombs and recruiting terror cells during the Second Intifada. Shahadeh will be deported. Iyad Abu-Shkheidem, a member of Hamas who masterminded a double suicide bombing in Beer-Sheva in 2004 in which 16 people were killed and more than 100 injured. He was also accused of preparing a bomb belt for a terrorist in 2004 who was caught on his way to a Jerusalem restaurant. Yousef al-Mabhouh of Gaza was serving a 15-year term for firing rockets, planting bombs and working in Hamas tunnels. Mabhouh had an additional 15 years added to his sentence for stabbing a guard at the Nafha Prison. Hatem al-Jayousi, a founding member of Fatah’s Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades serving multiple life sentences for the murder of six Israelis. Ali Haroub, a Hamas bombmaker. In 2013, Israeli prison authorities thwarted a kidnapping plot that Haroub had planned from his cell. Jamal Tawil, a Hamas figure who had been working to extend the terror groups influence in Judea and Samaria. Arrested in 2021, Tawil was convicted of inciting violence, organizing riots, and trying to set up Hamas headquarters in Ramallah. Shadi Barghouti, who was serving 27 years for numerous shooting and bombing attacks. The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how many are alive. Since the ceasefire went into effect, 583 Palestinian prisoners have been released. The fate of the remaining 65 hostages will be determined by negotiations during the ceasefire’s second phase. Critics say the phased approach condemns hostages not freed in the beginning to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 76 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed to be dead.

Iran currency plunges to record lows amid escalating US tensions	Facing an official inflation rate of about 35%, Iranians seeking safe havens for their savings have been buying dollars, other hard currencies, gold or cryptocurrencies, suggesting further headwinds for the rial. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Iran’s currency fell on Saturday to a new all-time low against the US dollar after the country’s supreme leader rejected talks with the United States and President Donald Trump moved to restore his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Tehran. The rial plunged to 892,500 to the dollar on the unofficial market on Saturday, compared with 869,500 rials on Friday, according to the foreign exchange website alanchand.com. The bazar360.com website said the dollar was sold for 883,100 rials. Asr-e-no website reported the dollar trading at 891,000 rials. Facing an official inflation rate of about 35%, Iranians seeking safe havens for their savings have been buying dollars, other hard currencies, gold or cryptocurrencies, suggesting further headwinds for the rial. The dollar has been gaining against the rial since trading around 690,000 rials at the time of Trump’s re-election in November amid concerns that Trump would re-impose his 'maximum pressure' policy against Iran with tougher sanctions and empower Israel to strike Iranian nuclear sites. Trump in 2018 withdrew from a nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and re-imposed U.S. economic sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed. The deal had limited Iran’s ability to enrich uranium, a process that can yield fissile material for nuclear weapons. Iran’s rial has lost more than 90% of its value since the sanctions were reimposed in 2018.

Israel forms draft plan to let Gazans leave by sea, air	While 69% of Israelis support the plan, with 18% opposing it, only 36% believe it's practical, as Arab countries and some Western governments oppose the idea. By JNS Israel has selected two potential exit points to allow Palestinians leave Gaza in accordance with U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent proposal to resettle the Strip’s population. At a briefing on Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces presented Defense Minister Israel Katz with a draft plan for safe passage, consisting of Ramon Airport, some 250 kilometers away from Gaza near Eilat, and Ashdod Port, about an hour’s drive up the Mediterranean coast from the Strip, according to an unnamed Israeli official cited in a report from Bloomberg on Friday. As things stand, the source continued, the military is assessing which of the five land crossings between the Strip and Israel would serve as a safe passageway with security screening. The idea of resettlement, suggested by Trump at a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House on Tuesday, received the backing of most Israelis, according to a Channel 12 News survey. However, while 69% supported the plan, with 18% opposing it, only 36% believed it was practical, as Arab countries and some Western governments voiced their opposition to the idea. Both Egypt and Jordan, named by Trump as potential destinations for the resettlement of Gazans, vehemently rejected the proposal. In Israel, reports emerged that OC Military Intelligence Directorate Maj.-Gen. Shlomi Binder issued a warning about the proposal, warning that it could trigger violence in Judea and Samaria. This propelled Katz to release a statement on Friday, saying, 'There will be no reality in which IDF officers will speak out against U.S. President Trump’s important plan regarding Gaza, and against the directives of the political echelon.' The Defense Ministry’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) unit was put in charge of the planning, the report read. During a meeting on Friday at the Oval Office with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Trump seemingly placed caveats on his proposal, saying there was 'no rush' to implement it. Trump said that his comments about Gaza being turned over from Israel to the U.S. as a 'real estate transaction' have been 'very well received,' and did not necessitate American soldiers being deployed to the Strip. 'We’re not talking about boots on the ground or anything, but I think the fact that we’re there, that we have an investment there, [will go] a long way to creating peace. We don’t want to see everybody move back and then leaving again in 10 years. We want to see stability and it would bring stability in the area,' the U.S. president said. Voluntary departure On Thursday, Katz said that he had instructed the IDF to prepare a plan to facilitate the voluntary departure of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. 'The plan will include exit options at land crossings as well as special arrangements for exit by sea and air,' he said. 'I welcome U.S. President Donald Trump’s bold plan. The residents of Gaza should be allowed to enjoy the freedom of exit and migration as is customary everywhere in the world.' Katz went on to state that 'countries like Spain, Ireland, Norway and others, which have made false allegations against Israel’s actions in Gaza, should by any account allow every Gazan resident to enter their territory. Their hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse to do so. There are countries like Canada, which has a regulated immigration program, that have expressed a desire in the past to absorb residents from Gaza.' Israel has been engaged in a devastating war in Gaza ever since Hamas carried out the single-day deadliest attack in Israel’s history on Oct. 7, 2023. The war has entered a ceasefire, hostages-terrorists exchange agreement phase over the past three weeks, as Washington seeks a permanent end to the conflict.

Trump’s aid cut to South Africa over its ICJ case against Israel,...	South Africa is 'undermining' US foreign policy and thus ‘poses national security threats' to America and its allies, said the executive order. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday cutting American aid to South Africa, citing, among other reasons, the country's legal case against Israel in the Hague, as well as South Africa's ties to Iran. 'South Africa has taken aggressive positions towards the United States and its allies, including accusing Israel, not Hamas, of genocide in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and reinvigorating its relations with Iran to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements,' the order noted. Pretoria, a harsh critic of Israel for many years, led the charge last year to accuse the Jewish state in the ICJ of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip in its defensive war against Hamas after the terror organization massacred 1,200 people in shootings, beheadings, burning and mass rapes during its October 7th, 2023 invasion. Israel has robustly defended its actions in the Strip to the Court, including by citing its low ratio of two noncombatants’ deaths to every terrorist killed, which is unheard-of in military conflicts. Much of its success was due to warning civilians out of battle zones ahead of time, and forming humanitarian corridors so they can leave safely, although this lost the IDF the element of surprise. Trump’s order also sharply criticized the black-led government of 'disregard of its citizens’ rights' in enacting an Expropriation Act that will make it easy to confiscate land from white Afrikaners without compensation, having 'countless' policies that reduce equal rights, and engaging in actions 'fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.' White Afrikaners own some 75% of the freehold farmland in the country. 'The United States cannot support the government of South Africa’s commission of rights violations in its country or its undermining United States foreign policy,' the order declared, 'which poses national security threats to our Nation, our allies, our African partners, and our interests.' All American agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) were ordered to halt their assistance to Pretoria. A back door was left open by the caveat that an agency head could permit provision of aid if the head deems it 'necessary or appropriate.' The order also introduced a policy of 'promot[ing] the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination.' South African President Cyril Ramaphosa responded by saying that his country 'will not be bullied' by the United States. The government’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation put out a statement charging that the 'foundational premise' of the order 'lacks factual accuracy' and was the seeming result of a 'campaign of misinformation and propaganda.' It ignored the foreign policy aspect of the order, only calling it 'ironic' that it 'makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged, while vulnerable people in the US from other parts of the world are being deported and denied asylum despite real hardship.'

Netanyahu defends Trump’s Gaza plan, says Gazans who eschew terro...	Israeli prime minister appears on Fox News during Washington trip to defend Donald Trump's plan to relocate Gaza's population, suggests Gazans who eschew terror will ultimately be able to return to the Strip. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended President Donald Trump's plan for resettling the Gaza Strip's entire population in third-party countries, while claiming that Gazans will eventually be allowed to return to the Strip if they so choose - so long as they eschew terrorism. Appearing on Fox News Saturday evening in a pre-recorded interview with Mark Levin, Netanyahu, who left Washington D.C. for Israel on Sunday, hailed Trump's proposal, first unveiled last Tuesday, as the 'first fresh idea in years.' 'It has the potential to change everything in Gaza,' Netanyahu added, calling it a 'novel approach, and the correct approach.' Netanyahu said the mass relocation would be entirely voluntary, rejecting accusations that it would constitute ethnic cleansing. It is 'not forcible eviction,' the premier noted. 'Not ethnic cleansing. Getting out from what all these countries and all these do-gooders say is an open-air prison. Why do you want to keep them in prison?' While Trump had on Tuesday appeared to suggest that Gazans would not return to the Strip, Netanyahu said that those who 'disavow' terror would eventually be permitted back. 'Give them an option to relocate temporarily while we rebuild the place physically and while we also rebuild it in terms of radicalization. You want to come back? You have to disavow terrorism, but you can come back.' Netanyahu also denied reports that he had torpedoed hostage deal talks throughout 2024, blaming the Hamas terror organization for the failure to reach a second deal earlier. 'That's false. It's the ones who are keeping them in those dungeons. These Hamas terrorists, it's not me.' The Israeli premier also touted the return of Israeli hostages during the November 2023 deal, the ongoing deal signed last month, and through rescue efforts since October 7th, 2023, saying that security experts had once predicted that few if any of the captives would be brought back alive. 'At the beginning of the war, people said, including the most senior defense officials, they said, ‘We're not going to get any of these hostages out. We have to assume that that's not going to happen.’' 'I said, ‘No. We're going to fight Hamas, and at the same time, we're going to release the hostages.’ And that's essentially what we've been doing up to now. I never gave up on them. And by the end of next week, we'll probably have about 75% of the living hostages. They're also holding bodies as hostages. I mean, these are monsters. But we're going to get 75% of the living hostages out, which, and I intend to get all of them out.'

IDF withdraws from Netzarim Corridor, bolsters Gaza border	The IDF began to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor in late January, enabling the return of displaced Gaza residents to the northern Strip. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces redeployed from the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza to outposts along the perimeter of the Strip as part of the implementation of the hostages-terrorists swap agreement with Hamas. 'Forces from 162nd Division, 143rd Division and 99th Division under the Southern Command have been deployed at several points in the Gaza Strip region to strengthen the defensive layer for the residents of the western Negev and the State of Israel,' the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said on Friday. Senior officers of the IDF’s Southern Command held a field assessment along with fighters on the ground in anticipation of the next phase of the release of the Israeli captives held in the Gaza Strip, the military said. The IDF began to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor in late January, enabling the return of displaced Gaza residents to the northern Strip. Defense Minister Israel Katz emphasized that Israel will continue to strictly enforce the ceasefires, both with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, warning that any violation will be met with a strong response. Meanwhile, Gazan residents have been cautioned against approaching IDF troops, including near the Rafah Crossing and the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian border. On Wednesday, IDF fighters fired on suspects who posed a threat to them in several parts of the Gaza Strip, the army said. In one instance in southern Gaza, soldiers identified suspects and fired warning shots to distance them. After the suspects continued advancing toward the troops, the troops fired 'additional shots to remove the threat.'

Could Turkey, Qatar face legal action for hosting Hamas?	Global coalition of 850 organizations combating antisemitism launch campaign pushing for legal action against leaders of Qatar, Turkey, and other states which harbor Hamas leaders or sponsor the group. By World Israel News Staff Hundreds of NGOs around the world are calling for legal sanctions against countries hosting Hamas' leadership, after three Israeli men released by Hamas Saturday showed signs of severe starvation. The Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM), a global coalition of 850 organizations fighting antisemitism, announced over the weekend the launch of a new international campaign pushing for legal action against Hamas and those nations that sponsor it and host its senior members, including Iran, Qatar and Turkey The bid was launched, CAM said, after the 'appalling images of the recent release of Israeli hostages,' who suffered long-term starvation while in Hamas captivity. 'What Hamas is doing is reminiscent of the Nazis, who also used murder, rape, torture and starvation against innocent Jewish victims during the Holocaust,' said CEO of CAM Sacha Roytman Dratwa. 'International law as we know it was formulated in the post-Holocaust era to ensure that these types of crimes against humanity would never happen again. However, they are happening before our very eyes, and the international community and so-called humanitarian NGOs appear to be reacting with a collective sigh of disinterest.' 'On the basis of international humanitarian law, crimes against humanity and international jurisdiction, we are calling for immediate legal action, not only against Hamas and its leaders but against all those countries which have assisted it and provide sanctuary to its leaders.' 'We should remain focused on the crimes of October 7th. We have to also draw attention and attach culpability to all those involved in the countless crimes of the murder, rape, maiming, torture and starvation of Israelis and other nationals being held in Gaza over the last 16 months since then.'

Police battle Bedouin crime in Negev with undercover operation	I was constantly afraid they might harm me,' says undercover agent of experience during 18-month-long investigation against Bedouin crime family. By World Israel News Staff Bedouinorganized crime families are facing a crackdown by Israeli police, as the authorities work to bust so-called 'protection' rackets and rampant intimidation in the Negev's construction industry. For years, residents of Israel's south have complained about deteriorating law and order in the region, including widespread extortion which sees business owner forced to pay monthly 'fees' to Bedouin mafias, or risk seeing their businesses vandalized or destroyed. Even local government tenders have been affected by organized crime, with mafias controlling the allocation of lucrative state contracts to specific construction companies. Speaking to Hebrew-language Ynet, two police officers recently involved in an advanced undercover operation revealed how the authorities are utilizing new strategies to combat the phenomenon in construction projects. The investigation began after numerous contractors who were awarded tenders to build a new neighborhood in the Bedouin town of Segev Shalom were intimidated by a local crime family. Claiming ownership rights over the land on which the neighborhood is slated to be built, the mafia has threatened contractors, burned their construction equipment, and scared workers away from the site, making the project's advancement impossible. The police planted undercover agents at the construction site, who posed as security guards and laborers. The agents were repeatedly directly threatened by members of the mafia, who told them to abandon the project or risk consequences targeting their families. One of the agents involved, who was identified only by his first initial A, told Ynet that the mafia have a sophisticated system in order to determine the identifies of those working at the site. A said that seemingly-innocent children were sent to ask workers their names and communities of origin. That information would be reported back to mafia leadership, who would then dispatch so-called 'soldiers' to threaten the families of those involved in the project. 'Throughout the work [at the construction site], my heart raced,' another undercover agent, identified as H, said. 'I was constantly afraid they might harm me,' he told Ynet, adding that as he 'drove around the area to check on the progress [of the building], there was always an ATV nearby with a masked man riding back and forth, reporting on our movements.' After an investigation lasting nearly 18 months, the police gathered enough evidence of threats and intimidation for a criminal indictment against two local crime families. In a statement to Ynet, the families' defense attorneys, Esther Bar Zion and Victor Uzan, claimed that their clients were innocent. 'These accusations are baseless and intended to intimidate the&#8230; families, as well as the broader Bedouin community. Behind the scenes, powerful economic interests, contractors and construction companies, are exploiting false complaints to secure police assistance in advancing construction projects, despite court orders delaying' construction projects, said Bar Zion and Uzan.

Trump expresses hope nuke deal can avert Israeli strikes on Iran	President Trump says he is pushing for a new nuclear deal with Iran to avoid Israel 'bombing the hell out of Iran.' By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump expressed his support last Friday for a new nuclear deal with Tehran, so long as it ensures Iran remains 'non-nuclear,' thus avoiding possible Israeli airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. The president spoke with The New York Post onboard Air Force One on Friday, discussing the war between Russia and Ukraine, his efforts to reach out to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the prospects of a new nuclear agreement with Tehran. Trump told the Post that favors negotiations to resolve the simmering tensions with Iran, and to avert Israeli military action against Iran's nuclear program. 'I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear. I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it,' Trump said. 'They don’t want to die. Nobody wants to die.' 'If we made the deal, Israel wouldn’t bomb them.' The president declined to share details on how he will handle talks with Tehran. 'In a way, I don’t like telling you what I’m going to tell them. You know, it’s not nice.' 'I could tell what I have to tell them, and I hope they decide that they’re not going to do what they’re currently thinking of doing. And I think they’ll really be happy.' Trump's comments on Friday echoed a statement he issued via his Truth Social account last Wednesday, emphasizing his preference for a negotiated settlement to ensure Tehran does not acquire nuclear capabilities. 'I want Iran to be a great and successful Country, but one that cannot have a Nuclear Weapon. Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens,' ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED,' Trump wrote. 'I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper. We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed. God Bless the Middle East!'

Jew-hating UN official: Israel ‘arrogant’ for leaving HRC	Albanese did not acknowledge that the populations of both Gaza and Palestinian Authority-controlled enclaves in Judea and Samaria have grown since October 7th, which disproves her allegation of genocide against the Palestinian. By World Israel News Staff A virulently antisemitic and anti-Israel United Nations official expressed outrage last week over Israel's decision to withdraw from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), deeming the move 'extremely serious.' United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese has a long history of remarks indicating a deep bias against Jews and Israel. In a recent interview with Reuters, Albanese blasted Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar's statement about Israel's reasons for withdrawing from the council, in which he noted a disproportionate number of resolutions condemning Israel by the body. Sa'ar's statements about the council's unrelenting persecution oft Israel 'shows the hubris and the lack of realization of what they [Israel] have done,' Albanese claimed to Reuters. She said that by withdrawing from the body, Israel is 'insist[ing] in self-righteousness, that they have nothing to be held accountable for, and they are proving it to the entire international community.' Referring to ongoing counter-terror operations being carried out in Jenin and other hotbeds of Islamic extremism in northern Samaria, Albanese said she was 'concerned' that the Israeli 'genocide' was expanding. 'The north [of Samaria] is being attacked primarily by soldiers. The south has been attacked primarily by [Israeli] settlers, and you can see this as an assault on the Palestinian people as a whole,' Albanese told Reuters. Albanese did not acknowledge that the populations of both Gaza and Palestinian Authority-controlled enclaves in Judea and Samaria have grown since October 7th, which disproves her allegation of genocide against the Palestinian. Albanese slammed a proposal by President Donald Trump for the U.S. to assume control of rebuilding Gaza, which would include the temporary resettlement of Gazan civilians in other countries. She blamed the U.S. president for 'destroying the basic principles of respect for human rights across a huge spectrum, not just in Palestine,' adding that the world has 'moved further towards the abyss.' Albanese said she was baffled by the relatively lowkey European pushback to the outline. 'I'm surprised that European states are staying silent instead of rising up and saying, 'This is utter nonsense, and we will not tolerate this',' she said.

Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami freed from Gaza, resemble Holo...	Israelis are drawing chilling parallels to the Muselmann—a term from the Holocaust used to describe Jewish prisoners in Nazi concentration camps who were starved to the brink of death. World Israel News and JNS Staff Three Israelis were freed on Saturday after 491 days in Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip, bringing the total number of hostages redeemed in the ongoing first phase of the ceasefire agreement to 21. Or Levy, 34, Eli Sharabi, 52, and Ohad Ben Ami, 56, were handed over by the Red Cross officials to Israel Defense Forces troops at around 11:15 a.m. local time and driven back to Israeli territory some 30 minutes later. The IDF brought the freed hostages to a facility near the border for a preliminary physical and psychological examination, and to meet with their families. Before their release, Hamas paraded the hostages on a stage in front of a raucous crowd of Palestinians in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah. The three men appeared frail and emaciated. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office released a statement welcoming home the captives. 'The government of Israel embraces the three returnees,' it read, adding, 'The shocking images that we have seen today will not go unaddressed. 'The government, together with all of the security officials, will accompany them and their families. The government of Israel is committed to returning all of the hostages and the missing,' it continued. The PMO statement concluded with a quote from Psalms (31:15): 'Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, from those who pursue me.' The condition of the hostages has sparked intense reactions across social media. Many Israelis are drawing chilling parallels to the Muselmann—a term from the Holocaust used to describe Jewish prisoners in Nazi concentration camps who were starved to the brink of death. The hostages appeared visibly frail, showing signs of extreme exhaustion and severe weight loss. Their protruding bones, sunken cheeks, and pronounced clavicles and Adam’s apples painted a harrowing picture of malnutrition and muscle atrophy. For many, these haunting images are a stark reminder of history, with some online noting a tragic resemblance to the suffering endured by Muselmann prisoners during one of humanity’s darkest periods. 'This is what a crime against humanity looks like!' Israeli President Isaac Herzog wrote in a post on X. 'The whole world must look directly at Ohad, Or, and Eli—returning after 491 days of hell, starved, emaciated and pained—being exploited in a cynical and cruel spectacle by vile murderers. We take solace in the fact that they are being returned alive to the arms of their loved ones,' Herzog wrote. 'Completing the hostage deal is a humanitarian, moral, and Jewish duty. It is essential to bring back all our sisters and brothers from the hell of captivity in Gaza—every last one of them!' he added. 'A psychological war is being waged that can cause harm to us,' said Dr. Gilad Bodenheimer, chief of the ministry’s mental health division. 'We urge the public to minimize exposure to distressing images and videos and to be mindful of what they, their children and their loved ones are seeing.' Added the Hostage and Missing Families Forum: 'The disturbing images from the release of Ohad, Eli and Or serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt—there is no time to waste for the hostages!' Levy was kidnapped from the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re’im during the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. His wife, Eynav, was killed; their now three-year-old son Almog has been living with his grandparents since the terrorist assault. Sharabi and his brother Yossi were abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri during the Palestinian invasion. Sharabi’s wife and daughters were murdered in their home during the attack, while Yossi has since been confirmed dead, his body still being held in Gaza. Ben Ami was taken from Be’eri along with his wife, Raz, who was freed as part of a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. In return, Israel was set on Saturday to release 183 Palestinian terrorists: 18 serving life sentences, 54 serving lengthy terms and 111 who were arrested in Gaza during the war. Last Saturday, Israelis Yarden Bibas, Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegel were freed from Gaza. Two days earlier, three Israelis—IDF soldier Agam Berger, 20, along with civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, Gadi Mozes, 80, and five Thai farm workers—Pongsak Thaenna, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Saethao and Surasak Lamnao—were redeemed from terrorist captivity. The previous week, Jerusalem redeemed four female IDF soldiers—Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19—who were abducted from the Nahal Oz base during the Hamas-led invasion. Three civilian women—Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher—were released on Jan. 19, shortly after the ceasefire went into effect. According to Israeli estimates, there are 76 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 73 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, 178 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 35 bodies, 34 of them taken during the cross-border invasion and that of IDF Lt. Hadar Goldin, which was taken by the Palestinian terrorist group in 2014.

Details of horrific conditions in captivity revealed by hostages	The hostages had no access to media and were unaware of the details of the October 7th massacre. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The testimonies of the three hostages released on Saturday night—Ohad Ben-Ami, Eli Sharabi, and Or Levy—reveal that they suffered physical and mental abuse, were starved, and were confined to tunnels without exposure to daylight. Additionally, they had no access to media and were unaware of the details of the October 7 massacre. Eli Sharabi was unaware that his wife, Lianne, and their two daughters—13-year-old Yahel and 16-year-old Noya—had been murdered during the attack. He only discovered the tragic news upon his release. Hamas captors increased the hostages' food intake before their release, likely in an attempt to conceal human rights abuses. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Health Ministry's General Medicine Division, said, 'The harrowing images of the three released hostages reinforce reports of severe abuse during their captivity.' 'They have endured significant malnutrition, a testament to the horrors they faced. These images are deeply distressing—not only for the families welcoming their loved ones home but also for those still waiting for their hostages to return,' Dr. Mizrahi added. After medical staff at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Sheba Medical Center examined the freed hostages, they concluded that the men had lost around 30% of their body weight. Upon his release, Or Levy, who was kidnapped at the Nova Music Festival, requested to meet with the parents of Aner Shapira, whom he last saw at the bomb shelter in Re’im. He mistakenly believed that Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Almog Sarusi had been released, but both had been murdered in captivity. Netanyahu, who is currently visiting officials in Washington, D.C., released a statement welcoming the hostages' release but expressing outrage over their condition. 'The Israeli government welcomes the hostages' return, confirming to their families that they are now in the care of our forces,' the statement read. Reacting to images of the freed hostages in their starved condition, Netanyahu added, 'The shocking images that we have seen today will not go unaddressed.' The PMO also stated, 'Given the critical condition of the three hostages and Hamas’s repeated violations, Prime Minister Netanyahu has ordered that this not be overlooked and that appropriate action be taken.'

His wife and daughters murdered, his brother declared dead	The story of Ohad Ben Ami’s captivity crystallizes the ongoing hostage crisis through intimate family details: a daughter discovering her father’s capture through social media; a wife returning home alone from Hamas captivity; and a warm home in Kibbutz Be’eri that stands empty, waiting for his return. By Noam Dvir, JNS Eli Sharabi, 52, was released from Hamas captivity on Saturday, alongside Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy. He was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Be’eri on Oct. 7, 2023, the day of the Hamas-led massacre. But his story is not just one of abduction, it is a family tragedy. His wife, Lianne, and their two daughters, 13-year-old Yahel and 16-year-old Noya, were murdered. He now has to face the harrowing reality that his immediate family has been wiped out. 'We are overwhelmed and so happy to hear Eli’s name on the list of those returning tomorrow. I want to thank everyone and all of Israel for standing with us. Now, please let us support Eli and protect his privacy,' said the wife of Yossi Sharabi, Eli’s sister-in-law, whose husband was murdered in captivity and whose body remains in Gaza, said on Friday. At the same time that Eli was taken, his brother Yossi, 51, who also lived in Be’eri, was kidnapped. Hamas later released a video of him in captivity, but in June, the IDF informed the family that he had been murdered and that his body was being held in Gaza. A brother fighting for his life The Sharabi family consists of five siblings, two of whom were taken hostage. Stepping into the role of a determined advocate, 48-year-old Sharon Sharabi has become the face of the fight for their return, battling for the release of his brother Eli, who was considered alive in captivity, and for Yossi’s body to be brought home for burial. 'Beyond being brothers, we are also best friends,' Sharon shared. 'We don’t even have time to grieve because we are fighting for Eli’s life.' Rotem, Sharon’s daughter and Eli’s niece, also spoken out about the toll on the family. 'What we’ve been going through since then is unbearable. We are not the same family we used to be, something in our bond has been fractured, and it will never be the same again.' Eli is described as a sharp-minded man, a natural leader who always takes command. But in captivity, he was utterly powerless. The hope for a mother’s embrace The Sharabi family originally lived in Tel Aviv. As a teenager, Eli moved to Be’eri and fell in love with life on the kibbutz. His younger brother Yossi followed him, and together they built their lives there. Their 75-year-old mother was initially shielded from the news of their abduction to spare her the pain. Eventually, the family had no choice but to tell her the truth. Sharon pictured the emotional moment of reunion. 'I can see the moment my mother hugs Eli, after we’ve lost four family members, Lianne, his wife, and their two daughters, Noya and Yahel. I will let my sisters have their moment first, and then I will say the Shehecheyanu blessing for having reached this time. And then, I will give him the biggest hug I know how to give, with the entire nation behind us.' Ohad Ben Ami with his daughter Ella. Credit: Courtesy. ‘They are with us. I hear gunshots’: Ohad Ben Ami’s message before captivity The story of Ohad Ben Ami’s captivity crystallizes the ongoing hostage crisis through intimate family details: a daughter discovering her father’s capture through social media; a wife returning home alone from Hamas captivity; and a warm home in Kibbutz Be’eri that stands empty, waiting for his return. This 56-year-old resident, taken from his home in sleepwear alongside his wife, Raz, during the Oct. 7 attack, represents one of the many personal tragedies still unfolding in the wake of Hamas’s assault on Israel’s Gaza border communities. Ohad and Raz’s ordeal began during the Oct. 7 attack on Be’eri, after an extended period hiding in their safe room. The terrorists, who initially passed by their seemingly empty house, later returned. Ohad’s last message to his daughter was chilling: 'They are with us. I hear gunshots.' The enduring image of his capture shows him being led away by terrorists, dressed only in a short-sleeved shirt and underwear, while his Raz, 57, was similarly taken in her sleepwear. Soon after being freed from Hamas captivity in November 2023 as part of the first ceasefire deal, Raz shared her anguish: 'My husband, Ohad, the love of my life and father of my children, remains in captivity. On October 7, the terrorists shattered our paradise and dragged us in our pajamas into hell. The world must not maintain its silence. Each day he spends there endangers his life. Bring him home now.' Or Levy. Credit: Israel Hayom. The murdered wife, the young son waiting to see him: The story of Or Levy The couple arrived at the Supernova music festival nine minutes before hell broke loose. As the Gazan rockets rained down, they ran for shelter. Or called his mother, Geula, and told her, 'Mom, you don’t want to know what’s happening here.' That was the last time his family heard his voice over the phone. Ten minutes later, Hamas terrorists threw grenades and opened fire in all directions. Einav was murdered, and Or was abducted into the tunnels of Gaza. The boy who keeps asking about his parents Or, a software developer by profession, is the father of Almog, who celebrated his third birthday without his parents. He has been raised by his grandparents, and as time passes, his memories of his mother and father are fading. 'Almog keeps asking about his mom and dad,' said his uncle, Michael, in a speech at the U.N. 'Even when we try to explain, he doesn’t understand why he can’t see his father or what the words ‘Mom is never coming back’ mean. But this boy can still get his father back. Don’t let him become an orphan from his father too.' The abduction footage The Hamas terrorist organization has not released any documentation of Or Levy from captivity, nor has it been reported in the media who among the hostages has seen him or when. However, two videos shed light on what happened to him. The first is footage from the bomb shelter that has since been dubbed the 'death shelter,' capturing the moments of terror. Michael, Or’s brother, described the harrowing video: 'The last image we have of him is heartbreaking—covered in his wife’s blood, dazed and terrified. It’s an extremely difficult video to watch. Or is seen surrounded by bodies, one of them Einav’s. The terrorists can be heard speaking Arabic to one another, saying that someone is still alive. They ask Or if he is a soldier. You can hear him begging them not to take him, not to shoot him. That video was the first time I saw what had happened to Or.' Michael added, 'He’s my younger brother. All these years, I was the one protecting him. It was unbearable to see the horror on his face in the most terrible moments of his life, knowing that there was nothing I could do to help him.' Additionally, in June 2024, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum released a video showing the terrorists driving toward Gaza in a pickup truck on Oct. 7. Inside the vehicle were four hostages, including the late Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eliya Cohen, and Or. Originally published by Israel Hayom.

US Supreme Court to weigh landmark terrorism case targeting Pales...	If the justices rule in favor of the plaintiffs, it could set a precedent allowing American victims of international terrorism to pursue legal claims against foreign entities that support or enable such attacks. By Debbie Weiss, The Algemeiner In a case that could redefine the legal landscape for victims of terrorism seeking justice, the US Supreme Court is set to hear arguments against the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) over their role in incentivizing violence against Americans abroad. The high-profile brief — filed this week by a legal coalition and more than a dozen organizations in response to the 2018 murder of Israeli-American Ari Fuld by a Palestinian terrorist — calls on justices to hold the Palestinian leadership accountable for its controversial 'pay-for-slay' program. The amicus brief, submitted on Tuesday by the International Legal Forum (ILF) and 16 other Jewish and pro-Israel organizations, argues that the PA and PLO have long been complicit in orchestrating and financially rewarding acts of terror. 'Since their founding, the PLO and the Palestinian Authority have been an instrumental element in inciting, funding, and rewarding terrorism, especially through the pay-for-slay program,' ILF CEO Arsen Ostrovsky told The Algemeiner. 'They are not a powerless bystander but a leading driver of modern-day terrorism. Enough is enough.' The so-called 'pay-for-slay' scheme has been widely condemned by US lawmakers, with reports estimating that approximately 8 percent of the PA’s budget is allocated to paying stipends to convicted terrorists and their families. As outlined in the ILF’s legal filing, 'the more deadly the attack and the longer the terrorist spends in prison, the greater the stipends they receive.' The legal brief contends that the US Congress has clear constitutional authority to permit American victims of Palestinian terrorism to sue the PA and PLO in US courts, since these entities have maintained a presence on American soil and were previously warned that their activities could expose them to legal action. Palestinian leaders 'had been on notice that their activities would subject them to jurisdiction, yet have continued to reward and sponsor terrorism regardless,' Ostrovsky said. The lawsuit was initially filed under the US Anti-Terrorism Act by Fuld’s widow and other American victims of Palestinian terror, seeking damages from the PA and PLO. However, the case faced a major setback in 2023 when the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that US federal courts lack jurisdiction over the Palestinian entities, citing concerns over the due process rights of foreign organizations. Congress attempted to address this legal gap in 2019 with the passage of the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA), which sought to ensure that the PA and PLO could be held accountable in American courts if they funded attacks against US citizens or conducted activities within the United States. The brief argues that the PA and PLO have done both, and therefore must face legal consequences. 'It is imperative to hold not only Hamas accountable, but the Palestinian leadership as well,' Ostrovsky said. 'Acts of terror, such as the one that claimed the life of Ari Fuld, do not occur in a vacuum. They are the direct result of a pervasive Palestinian infrastructure that indoctrinates hate and incentivizes violence.' The development coincides with an ongoing ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, which included the release last month of Ari Fuld’s killer, Khalil Jabarin. Ari Fuld’s brother, Hillel Fuld, said the family’s 'personal grievance and loss was currently amplified' by Jabarin’s release from prison. Reflecting on the hostage deal that saw Jabarin walk free — financially secure by Palestinian standards due to the pay-for-slay stipends he received while in prison — Fuld acknowledged that the situation was 'not black and white.' 'On the one hand this is a terrible, terrible deal from a strategic perspective, and there’s no sugarcoating the fact that letting go of thousands of monsters is just horrible,' he told The Algemeiner. 'The flip side is that it’s the most beautiful thing there is to see those families reunited, and it’s a fundamental pillar of Judaism to free our prisoners, our people, and our soldiers need to know that we will do whatever it takes to bring them back if such a thing happens to them.' Ostrovsky expressed his hope that the Supreme Court would hold Palestinian leaders accountable and prevent them from 'rewarding and underwriting murderers of American nationals abroad, like Ari Fuld.' The court’s decision to take up the case marks a pivotal moment in US counterterrorism law. If the justices rule in favor of the plaintiffs, it could set a precedent allowing American victims of international terrorism to pursue legal claims against foreign entities that support or enable such attacks. The brief was filed on behalf of ILF by the Holtzman Vogel law firm as well as the National Jewish Advocacy Center, with oral arguments expected later in the year.

IDF strikes terror targets in Syria and Lebanon	The IAF struck a Hamas weapons storage facility in Syria, and another attack targeted and eliminated Hezbollah terrorists in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon. By JNS The Israeli Air Force on Saturday attacked a facility in southern Syria belonging to the Gaza-based Hamas terrorist organization, the IDF said. 'A short while ago, Israeli Air Force fighter jets, guided by the Intelligence Directorate and Northern Command, struck a Hamas weapons storage facility in the Deir Ali area of southern Syria. The weapons were intended for perpetrating terror attacks against IDF forces,' the Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson’s Unit said. 'The Palestinian terror organizations, led by Hamas, operate by exploiting Syrian territory to establish terrorist activities under Iranian direction,' the military added. It went on to say that Israel will continue to strike Hamas 'wherever it attempts to establish itself' and will act against terrorist efforts 'to expand and strengthen [their forces].' The Israeli Air Force on Saturday attacked Hezbollah forces in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson’s Unit said. 'An IAF aircraft conducted an intelligence-based strike on Hezbollah operatives in the area of the Beqaa in Lebanon,' the statement read. 'The strike was conducted after the terrorists were operating in a strategic weapons manufacturing and storage site belonging to the terrorist organization,' the military continued. 'The activity at the site is a broad violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,' it stressed, referring to the ceasefire terms with Hezbollah signed on Nov. 26. 'The IDF continues to operate to remove any threat to the State of Israel and will prevent any attempt by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to rebuild its forces, in accordance with the ceasefire understandings,' the statement concluded. This was the second consecutive day in which the IAF carried out attacks in the Land of the Cedars. The Air Force conducted precision strikes overnight Friday inside Lebanon, targeting two sites containing Hezbollah weapons. The military did not specify the location of the sites. On Monday, Israeli forces dismantled Hezbollah infrastructure in Southern Lebanon, as part of the Israel Defense Forces’ ongoing defensive operations there, the military said. Soldiers from the 769th 'Hiram' Territorial Brigade and 7th 'Storm from the Golan' Armored Brigade located weapons storage facilities containing what the IDF said were significant stockpiles of military equipment. Additionally, Israeli forces killed several Hezbollah operatives in the area and detained individuals who posed a threat to their mission.

State Dept notifies Congress of $7 billion arms sale to Israel	The first arms package, valued at $6.75 billion, includes a range of munitions and bomb components set for delivery this year, while the second, worth $600 million, consists of 3,000 Hellfire missiles scheduled for delivery in 2028. By JNS The U.S. State Department has notified Congress about its plan to sell $7 billion worth of weapons to Jerusalem, on the backdrop of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the White House last week. As the formal notice typically comes after an appeal to the top four lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who can raise objections, an approval by Congress is now more likely to occur, the Associated Press reported on Saturday. The plan consists of two separate plans that were submitted to Congress on Friday. The first includes an array of The first arms package, valued at $6.75 billion, includes a range of munitions and bomb components set for delivery this year, while the second, worth $600 million, consists of 3,000 Hellfire missiles scheduled for delivery in 2028.munitions from 166 small-diameter bombs to 2,800 500-pound bombs, as well as thousands of guidance kits, fuses and other bomb components and support equipment, totaling $6.75 billion and to begin delivery this year, according to the report. The second arms package, for $600 million, includes 3,000 Hellfire missiles and will begin its delivery in 2028, with additional training by the U.S. military. Since entering into office on Jan. 20, U.S. President Donald Trump lifted a partial arms embargo on 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, withheld by the Biden administration over concerns about the war in Gaza. To a question as to why he released the bomb sale, Trump responded, 'Because they [Israel] bought them.' Netanyahu was the first foreign leader to meet Trump at the Oval Office after his second inauguration, where the president proposed a plan to allow the Palestinian to voluntarily depart from the Gaza Strip and permanently resettle elsewhere. The two men also discussed the present Gaza ceasefire, as well as the strategy to stop Iran from attaining nuclear weapons. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the month that Netanyahu and his team are expected to press Trump to move forward with a separate set of arms transfers initially requested by the Biden administration, totaling more than $8 billion. 'The weapons haven’t yet received full approval because of a hold by some Democratic lawmakers,' the paper noted, citing a congressional official. Democrats have continued to express reservations about the weapons deal as they engage with the new administration, said a spokesman for the Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In the wake of Trump’s shipment approval regarding 2,000-pound bombs, Netanyahu said in a video message, 'Thank you, President Trump, for keeping your promise to give Israel the tools it needs to defend itself, to confront our common enemies and to secure a future of peace and prosperity.'

Netanyahu vows to take ‘appropriate action’ after hostages return...	FM Gideon Sa'ar: 'Hamas terrorists and Gaza residents appear well-fed, while the Israeli hostages resemble Holocaust survivors.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement on Saturday, declaring that 'appropriate action' will be taken in response to the emaciated condition of three male hostages freed from Hamas captivity. Hostages Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, and Ohad Ben Ami were released Saturday after 491 days in captivity. After medical staff at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Sheba Medical Center examined the freed hostages, they concluded that the men had lost around 30% of their body weight. The hostages, who had to be supported while walking and standing by Hamas terrorists, were forced to speak to a crowd in Gaza before being handed over to the Red Cross. Netanyahu, who is currently visiting officials in Washington, D.C., released a statement welcoming the hostages' release but expressing outrage over their condition. 'The Israeli government welcomes the hostages' return, confirming to their families that they are now in the care of our forces,' the statement read. Reacting to images of the freed hostages in their starved condition, Netanyahu added, 'The shocking images that we have seen today will not go unaddressed.' The PMO also stated, 'Given the critical condition of the three hostages and Hamas's repeated violations, Prime Minister Netanyahu has ordered that this not be overlooked and that appropriate action be taken.' The Hostage and Missing Families Forum compared the sight of the emaciated hostages to images of Jewish prisoners liberated from Nazi death camps during the Holocaust. 'The shocking images of Ohad, Eli, and Or expose the harrowing impact of 491 days in Hamas captivity. These men have endured unimaginable suffering—this is a crime against humanity,' the Hostage and Missing Families Forum stated. 'These distressing images lay bare to the world the desperate plight of every hostage still held in Gaza. They evoke painful echoes of the liberation of the camps in 1945, the darkest chapter in our history.' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar criticized the global focus on the plight of Gazans while ignoring the condition of the hostages. He wrote on X, 'For over a year, the international community has been misled by false claims of 'starvation' in Gaza.' 'But the images speak for themselves: Hamas terrorists and Gaza residents appear well-fed, while the Israeli hostages resemble Holocaust survivors—the only ones visibly suffering from starvation,' he continued. 'Hamas has committed crimes against humanity against kidnapped civilians. This Hamas-Nazi evil must be eliminated.'

Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami freed from Gaza after 491 days	Referring to the starved condition of the hostages, President Isaac Herzog wrote,'This is what a crime against humanity looks like!' By JNS Staff Three Israelis were freed on Saturday after 491 days in Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip, bringing the total number of hostages redeemed in the ongoing first phase of the ceasefire agreement to 21. Or Levy, 34, Eli Sharabi, 52, and Ohad Ben Ami, 56, were handed over by the Red Cross officials to Israel Defense Forces troops at around 11:15 a.m. local time and driven back to Israeli territory some 30 minutes later. The IDF brought the freed hostages to a facility near the border for a preliminary physical and psychological examination, and to meet with their families. Before their release, Hamas paraded the hostages on a stage in front of a raucous crowd of Palestinians in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah. The three men appeared frail and emaciated. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office released a statement welcoming home the captives. 'The government of Israel embraces the three returnees,' it read, adding, 'The shocking images that we have seen today will not go unaddressed. 'The government, together with all of the security officials, will accompany them and their families. The government of Israel is committed to returning all of the hostages and the missing,' it continued. The PMO statement concluded with a quote from Psalms (31:15): 'Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, from those who pursue me.' 'This is what a crime against humanity looks like!' Israeli President Isaac Herzog wrote in a post on X. 'The whole world must look directly at Ohad, Or, and Eli—returning after 491 days of hell, starved, emaciated and pained—being exploited in a cynical and cruel spectacle by vile murderers. We take solace in the fact that they are being returned alive to the arms of their loved ones,' Herzog wrote. 'Completing the hostage deal is a humanitarian, moral, and Jewish duty. It is essential to bring back all our sisters and brothers from the hell of captivity in Gaza—every last one of them!' he added. 'A psychological war is being waged that can cause harm to us,' said Dr. Gilad Bodenheimer, chief of the ministry’s mental health division. 'We urge the public to minimize exposure to distressing images and videos and to be mindful of what they, their children and their loved ones are seeing.' Added the Hostage and Missing Families Forum: 'The disturbing images from the release of Ohad, Eli and Or serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt—there is no time to waste for the hostages!' Levy was kidnapped from the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re’im during the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. His wife, Eynav, was killed; their now three-year-old son Almog has been living with his grandparents since the terrorist assault. Sharabi and his brother Yossi were abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri during the Palestinian invasion. Sharabi’s wife and daughters were murdered in their home during the attack, while Yossi has since been confirmed dead, his body still being held in Gaza. Ben Ami was taken from Be’eri along with his wife, Raz, who was freed as part of a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. In return, Israel was set on Saturday to release 183 Palestinian terrorists: 18 serving life sentences, 54 serving lengthy terms and 111 who were arrested in Gaza during the war. Last Saturday, Israelis Yarden Bibas, Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegel were freed from Gaza. Two days earlier, three Israelis—IDF soldier Agam Berger, 20, along with civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, Gadi Mozes, 80, and five Thai farm workers—Pongsak Thaenna, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Saethao and Surasak Lamnao—were redeemed from terrorist captivity. The previous week, Jerusalem redeemed four female IDF soldiers—Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19—who were abducted from the Nahal Oz base during the Hamas-led invasion. Three civilian women—Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher—were released on Jan. 19, shortly after the ceasefire went into effect. According to Israeli estimates, there are 76 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 73 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, 178 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 35 bodies, 34 of them taken during the cross-border invasion and that of IDF Lt. Hadar Goldin, which was taken by the Palestinian terrorist group in 2014.

Hamas warns Trump’s plan to move out Gazans could kill hostage de...	A Hamas offical warned that any plan aimed at displacing Palestinians would be considered a 'new occupation' and met with determined resistance. By World Israel News A Hamas official in Gaza issued a warning on Thursday, responding to US President Donald Trump's proposals about evacuating Palestinian refugees and establishing Gaza control. The official stated that Hamas would mount 'strong verbal and physical resistance' if Trump or the Israeli government attempted to enforce such a plan. He cautioned that implementing this proposal could jeopardize ongoing ceasefire talks and destabilize the region. Speaking to the Saudi newspaper A-Sharq Al-Awsat, the official emphasized that the plan would create 'far-reaching consequences affecting all regional countries,' with unpredictable outcomes. Although Hamas' leadership had reviewed Trump's statements individually, no formal discussions had taken place. Another senior Hamas official outside Gaza remarked that any effort to evacuate refugees would be viewed as an attempt to 'eliminate the Palestinian cause,' prompting both operational and diplomatic retaliation. The official urged the US administration to rethink its strategy. 'The Trump administration should focus on pressuring Netanyahu's government to advance the existing agreement rather than introducing disruptive proposals that could derail everything,' he said. He added that such actions would influence future phases of the ceasefire. Hamas considers Trump’s statements significant due to their public nature and the unified opposition they have generated globally. The terror group believes the proposal faces numerous obstacles that make its practical implementation unlikely, reducing it to a 'theoretical' concept. The Hamas offical warned that any plan aimed at displacing Palestinians would be considered a 'new occupation' and met with determined resistance.

Hamas holds up list of names of hostages for release, claims Isra...	Data from COGAT shows that 12,000 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza in direct contradiction to Hamas's claims. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas is deliberately delaying the release of the names of hostages to be freed on Saturday, a move that it claims is in retaliation for Israel allegedly failing to deliver sufficient aid. Sources told the Saudi state-owned news outlet Al Arabiya that Hamas did not deliver the names of hostages as expected on Friday because Israel allegedly did not allow mobile homes and tents into Gaza. They also claimed that Israel should provide vehicles to remove rubble as well as additional fuel. Hamas urged mediators in Egypt and Qatar to put pressure on Israel to deliver more aid. On Telegram, the terror group claimed that Israel was preventing patients from leaving Gaza for medical treatment. They also claimed that only 76 aid trucks entered Gaza, and none had winter coats or blankets. The Rafah municipality said it needed 40,000 tents and claimed that 40% of patients with kidney problems died due to a lack of care. 'Only about 10% of the humanitarian aid stipulated in the agreement has entered the Strip,' Hamas added. Data from COGAT shows that 12,000 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza in direct contradiction to Hamas's claims. Video footage, witness testimony, and other evidence have proven that Hamas routinely steals humanitarian aid and sells it to Gazan civilians at inflated prices. 'There were reports about a month ago that Hamas has earned as much as $500,000 by selling the humanitarian aid it looted from international organizations. With this money, it pays salaries to its remaining members and manages to mobilize new ones,' Professor Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies and a senior fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security, told TPS-IL. According to Michael, Hamas continues to take control of at least 50 percent of all humanitarian aid entering Gaza. 'Many trucks are being looted by Hamas even before they get into the hands of humanitarian organizations. The army recorded a conversation between two Hamas operatives in which they complained that their warehouses were so full they had nowhere to store the aid—this is the extent of the problem,' he said.

They did it anyway.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US Senator Ted Cruz said in an interview with The Daily Caller that the Biden administration 'poured hundreds of millions of dollars' into Hamas. Cruz was responding to questions about US President Donald Trump pausing and reviewing all existing foreign aid. 'They secretly funneled literally uncountable hundreds of millions of dollars to Hamas, including tens of millions in cash they could never account for,' Cruz said. 'Throughout the Biden administration, they knew the money they were pouring into Gaza would benefit Hamas,' the Texas senator wrote in an X post. 'They did it anyway.' According to The Daily Caller, the Biden administration gave $1.3 billion to groups that sponsored or were directly responsible for terrorism. Last July, Cruz issued a statement saying, 'Biden-Harris officials poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Hamas-controlled areas, which Hamas seized, ultimately allowing $100 billion to flow to the Ayatollah in Iran, much of which was also funneled toward terrorism.' 'In a real and direct way, the Biden-Harris administration funded the October 7 terrorist attack, which was the largest one-day mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust,' he continued. In 2022, Cruz demanded that the Biden administration withdraw $1 million in funding from an organization that investigated alleged abuses in Judea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip. Cruz, along with other Republican senators, said that singling out Israel in this way constitutes 'new antisemitism.' Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and 11 other Republican lawmakers called on the Biden administration to cancel the grant program and uphold its repeated pledges to combat the BDS movement. 'As a policy matter, it is wholly unacceptable for the State Department to fund NGOs to delegitimize and isolate Israel,' the lawmakers wrote. The State Department, the lawmakers allege, is using taxpayer dollars to promote 'new antisemitism' driven by 'a global network of anti-Israel nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights groups.'

Left-wing militant group pushing anti-ICE protests in LA teaches ...	UdB seeks to model itself on militant groups, such as the Brown Berets and the Black Panthers, as well as the socialist revolutions of Cuba and Venezuela. By Jessica Coestescu, The Washington Free Beacon A radical left-wing group, Unión del Barrio (UdB), is offering 'self-defense' training to combat Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. The Latino-focused organization, which models itself on militant groups like the Black Panthers, is also trying to recruit members for daily car patrols to help 'expel' ICE agents from neighborhoods. UdB, an American left-wing revolutionary socialist group was established in 1981 to combat 'all manifestations of colonial, imperialist, and neoliberal oppression.' The group’s website features a photo of Cuban soldiers holding AK-47s and claims that America is a 'violent and dangerous' 'empire in decline.' And last month, as President Donald Trump was about to take office and launch his promised mass deportations, UdB began offering self-defense trainings. It's also been involved in anti-ICE protests sweeping through Southern California. 'COMMUNITY SELF-DEFENSE! STOP THE ICE RAIDS!' the flyer advertising a Jan. 18 online training read. 'Learn how to identify undercover ICE vehicles that are used in ICE raids.' The group also boasted that at least 20 organizations had signed up for a Jan. 25 online training. 'Help us defend our communities from ICE!' a flyer for that event read. Two more, this time geared toward educators, were held Jan. 28 and Feb. 4. An in-person training is scheduled for Thursday in Los Angeles. 'We are ORGANIZING to fight ICE raids,' a flyer posted to Instagram reads. The caption said over 30 organizations will be present. UdB has also been involved in the recent wave of anti-ICE protests that have engulfed Southern California in response to Trump’s deportations. Some have led to illegal street and freeway blockades, as well as incidents of criminal vandalism. On UdB’s website, the group contends that protesting and radical rhetoric alone are not enough to bring about change. Instead UdB seeks to model itself on militant groups, such as the Brown Berets and the Black Panthers, as well as the socialist revolutions of Cuba and Venezuela. According to a PowerPoint presentation used in trainings reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon, UdB seeks to 'identify, denounce and expel' ICE officers from Mexican neighborhoods. It does so by teaching people how to identify the different types of U.S. immigration agencies, how to identify uniformed and undercover immigration officers, the vehicles they use, and their methods of operation. UdB members interested in further 'protecting communities from ICE and police terror' are encouraged to join and carry out daily car patrols, according to the training PowerPoint. 'The Community Patrols are a means of building community-based power that will challenge police and migra attacks,' UdB’s website states. 'These agencies are trained to profile, harass, detain, arrest, and brutalize our people. We are determined to build … barrio [neighborhood]-centered self-defense and prevent the detention and family separation that has taken place over the last several decades.' ​​'The objective is to organize our people in every barrio, block by block, to defend our communities from colonial violence and threats to our human and democratic rights,' the webpage continues. 'We intend to expose the anti-Raza [race] nature of the colonizer state that has now openly declared itself a tool to terrorize, repress, and exploit the lives and labor power of the Mexicano-Raza working class.' During the Jan. 18 online training session, UdB secretary general Adriana Jasso emphasized that self-defense is part of the greater socialist class struggle. 'The great majority of our people are providing for their families, are in survival mode under this colonial system,' Jasso said. 'For that reason, we stand together and we stand in unity and unconditional support to defend the working class of our communities and that’s who we identify with and that’s who we seek to defend in this period of struggle.' 'We don’t want anyone to be separated or to be deported,' Jasso continued. 'Our communities deserve to be seen, and we stand with them. We will defend them and our proposal to all of you is community self-defense. No one is going to tell us if we belong here or don’t belong here. We know that this is our struggle. We know that, going back to our history, this is where our people are supposed to be.' On Sunday the group released its own online guide outlining best practices for organizing protests. 'In recent days, we have seen a major surge of anger and community action, both on the streets of every U.S. city and on social media. Unión del Barrio applauds the courage of our gente in standing up to resist the current attacks against our community,' UbD wrote in a statement. UbD’s website includes three 'strategic goals to guide all areas of our community work for building people’s power.' Under the first goal, 'Community Level Self-Defense,' UdB says it must become 'a party capable of providing for the immediate self-defense of our communities within every sector of our population. Conditions are already truly dire for our gente, and things will inevitably be getting worse.' The second goal, 'dual and contending power,' refers to a concept used by revolutionary movements to undermine the state’s legitimacy and vie for control. 'We live in what is an empire in decline, which is domestically and internationally even more violent and dangerous than an ascending empire,' the website states. 'Precisely because of this, we must build a party capable of providing for the economic, political, cultural, and ideological self-determination and self-sufficiency within every sector of our population within the current borders of the U.S.' The final goal, written in Spanish, translates to 'Rearguard for Our America.' There, UdB argues that it must work toward the first two goals 'with the understanding that we have an essential role to fulfill as the historical Rearguard (Retaguardia) of the revolutionary process for liberation and socialism that is already taking place throughout Nuestra América.' 'When we struggle locally we must also identify ourselves with and actively defend the socialist revolution of Nuestra América [Our America] that is currently on the march in the South,' the site continues. In addition to 'resisting' immigration and law enforcement in the United States, UdB 'unconditionally uphold[s] the right of self-determination of indigenous people, and of all poor and oppressed people throughout the world.' As such, in the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, UdB announced that 'Palestinians and Mexicans/Indigenous people have a common enemy: settler colonialism.' 'Today, we express our solidarity with the bold resistance of Palestinians in their struggle against normalized Israeli state terror and settler colonization,' UdB wrote in a statement the day after the attack. 'Unión del Barrio stands with the people of Palestine and with their righteous struggle for self-determination and the right to return to their illegally occupied lands. The bold resistance of the Palestinian people is understood as such by billions of colonized and displaced people around the world, and we are confident that justice will prevail in Palestine!' UdB has since participated in dozens of anti-Israel and pro-Hamas protests according to Instagram posts reviewed by the Free Beacon. On the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 massacre, the group once again released a statement celebrating the attack and blaming Israel for the violence. UdB did not respond to a request for comment.

Azerbaijan state oil deal with Israeli gas field signals growing ...	Azerbaijan’s ties with Israel have long been significant, though often under the radar, and Baku has been Israel’s most vital ally in the Caucasus and Central Asia for more than three decades. By Debbie Weiss, The Algemeiner A deal struck this week between Israel and Azerbaijan’s state oil company, SOCAR, has underscored a geopolitical reality often overlooked: Azerbaijan’s emerging role as a strategic player in the evolving Middle East. While the Abraham Accords reshaped regional alliances under the first administration of US President Donald Trump, a second Trump term will usher in what some analysts call a 'New Middle East' — one that prioritizes regional security cooperation to counter Iran while favoring diplomacy over conflict, all while recalibrating America’s presence in the region. At the heart of this shifting landscape is Azerbaijan, a country that shares hundreds of border miles with Iran while maintaining deep ties with both Israel and Turkey, straddling multiple power blocs in ways that could prove crucial to Trump’s ambitions. According to Ze’ev Khanin, a professor of Eurasian geopolitics at Bar-Ilan University and a senior research fellow at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, Azerbaijan is a key part of strategic alliances that he calls 'unclosed triangles,' with Baku comprising the missing link. 'We are living in the world of so-called unclosed triangles, which is unlike what we had in the 19th century and 20th centuries — when the enemy of my enemy is my friend and the friend of my friend is also my friend,' he told The Algemeiner. One prominent example is the unclosed triangle of Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Israel. Despite strained ties between Turkey and Israel, Azerbaijan continues to use Turkey as a transit point for energy exports to Israel. 'The Turks didn’t stop the stream of Azerbaijani energy through Turkey to Israel,' Khanin said, adding that Ankara was eager to position itself as a transit hub for energy exports to Europe. Azerbaijan’s ties with Israel have long been significant, though often under the radar, and Baku has been Israel’s most vital ally in the Caucasus and Central Asia for more than three decades, with a partnership that spans across energy security, defense, and intelligence. As of 2019, more than 60 percent of Israel’s gasoline was sourced from Azerbaijan. Baku has also purchased advanced Israeli defense systems, including the 'Barak MX' missile system as well as surveillance satellites. The recent SOCAR deal investing in Israel’s offshore gas fields has further deepened these relations. Aaron Frenkel, an Israeli businessman, agreed to sell 48 percent of his holdings in the Tamar gas field to SOCAR, making the oil company a significant stakeholder in the Tamar gas field, which is a major natural gas source for Israel and has turned the country into a gas exporter in the region. This move not only cements Baku’s economic influence in the region but also places it at the crossroads of a growing pro-Western bloc seeking to counter Iran’s regional ambitions. Trump’s vision for the region, as articulated in past speeches and his meetings this week with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, involves shifting security responsibilities to local allies, forming what some have dubbed a 'Middle East NATO.' In this framework, normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia is a linchpin, but Azerbaijan’s strategic positioning could offer another key pillar, Khanin said. 'Everybody understands that Iran is not going anywhere,' Khanin said. Both Jerusalem and Washington recognize that, Khanin said, and see the need to form a strong pro-Western bloc of countries that, despite differing political ideologies, can cooperate because of overlapping security interests. As Trump seeks to end what he calls 'unnecessary wars,' he is looking to prioritize diplomatic solutions over direct military engagement, as evidenced by his comments this week seeking another deal with Iran. Trump also aims to end the war in Gaza, secure the release of Israeli hostages, and 'to limit, if not eliminate, Hamas,' Khanin said. Trump’s comments about a 'US takeover of Gaza' notwithstanding, his broader goal is to 'outsource the responsibility for Middle Eastern security' to a regional coalition with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other key US allies under American leadership, Khanin added. For Israel, the SOCAR agreement is more than an economic deal — it is a sign that Azerbaijan’s role in the region is expanding in ways that align with broader strategic goals, Khanin said. As the contours of the 'New Middle East' take shape, Baku may find itself in a position of influence it has never held before.

Netanyahu tells Saudis to create Palestinian state on their land	His remark was in response to a question regarding Saudi Arabia's stated precondition for normalizing ties with Israel—namely, a framework for the establishment of a Palestinian state. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in a Channel 14 interview on Thursday that Saudi Arabia has enough land to establish a Palestinian state within its borders. His remark was in response to a question regarding Saudi Arabia's stated precondition for normalizing ties with Israel—namely, a framework for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu responded,'The Saudis can create a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia; they have plenty of land over there.' Netanyahu, who has long opposed a two-state solution for security reasons, stated that he 'would not make an agreement that would endanger the State of Israel.' He added, 'Certainly not a Palestinian state. After October 7? Are you aware of what happened? There was a Palestinian state—it was called Gaza. Under Hamas rule, Gaza functioned as a Palestinian state, and the result was the worst massacre since the Holocaust.' The interview took place after a joint press conference featuring Netanyahu and then-US President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. During the conference, as the two leaders discussed the possibility of normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel, Netanyahu remarked, 'I think normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not only feasible—I think it's going to happen.' Shortly after the press conference, the Saudi foreign ministry stated that it would not negotiate normalization without a clear framework for a Palestinian state. Last May, after the governments of Spain, Norway, and Ireland unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state, Netanyahu condemned the move, calling the two-state proposal a 'reward for terrorism.' 'The intention of several European countries to recognize a Palestinian state is a reward for terrorism,' Netanyahu said. 'Eighty percent of the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria support the terrible massacre of October 7. This evil cannot be given a state.' 'This would be a terrorist state. It would attempt to repeat the October 7 massacre repeatedly; we will not allow this.' 'Rewarding terrorism will not bring peace, nor will it stop us from defeating Hamas.' Netanyahu’s comments echoed a tweet from Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz (Likud), who stated, 'Today’s decision sends a message to the Palestinians and the world: Terrorism pays.'

Social media gets creative over Trump’s plan to transform Gaza	What’s next – a Trump golf course in Rafah?' someone wrote on X. By Jewish Breaking News U.S. President Donald Trump’s dramatic proposal for Gaza’s future has sparked a surge of support among some segments of Israeli society. 'The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,' Trump declared as he stood alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday. As for Gaza’s residents, he said they should be provided with 'a good, fresh, beautiful piece of land' somewhere while rehabilitation takes place. The immediate response was visible on Tel Aviv’s main freeway Wednesday morning, where commuters were greeted by giant billboards featuring American flags alongside Trump’s image, with a simple message in English: 'Thank you, Mr. President,' JTA reports. Social media quickly lit up with reactions, including digitally altered images showing luxury hotels rising from Gaza’s landscape. Some users shared mock tourism posters featuring 'Trump International Gaza Beach Resort' while others created memes suggesting a 'Real Two-State Solution: Israel and America.' However, not all reactions have been positive. 'First the US couldn’t handle Afghanistan, now they want Gaza? This will be another Trump real estate flop,' wrote one influential Israeli X user. 'What’s next – a Trump golf course in Rafah?' wrote another. 'Trump thinks he can turn Gaza into Atlantic City. Someone should remind him how that worked out?' But behind the funny memes and hotel jokes, since the October 7 Hamas massacre which left 1,200 innocent people dead and 251 taken hostages. Netanyahu has struggled to define what comes next after he achieves his war goals in Gaza. Despite the seemingly outlandish nature of Trump’s proposal, for some, it at least offers a guarantee that that haunting nightmare will never happen again.

By The Associated Press A hearing in a New Mexico courtroom devolved into chaos when three people rushed the defendant in a homicide case, setting off a brawl with flying fists and kicks. Courtroom video cameras recorded the Jan. 31 melee, which subsided as a law enforcement officer drew a stun gun and protected the defendant from further attack. Felony charges were filed against two men: battery and assault on a public official. They apparently rushed the defendant in a fit of rage over the killing of a relative.

The courtroom video showed her hitting the defendant and an officer with a chair. The presence of corrections officers and other security details in courtrooms does not always keep the peace. Last year a defendant in a felony battery case in Nevada flung himself over a judge’s bench and grabbed her hair, sparking a bloody brawl with court officials. Katina Watson, court executive officer at New Mexico’s Second Judicial District, told KRQE that 'these are the types of things that we see regularly.' She praised an officer for reacting to ensure safety, without mention of potential security enhancements. The Associated Press sent a request to the court Thursday for comment on the fight and security precautions.

Trump slaps sanctions on anti-Israel International Criminal Court	The sanctions, the White House said, are in direct response to the 'ICC’s biased attacks on the U.S. and Israel.' By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday sanctioning the International Criminal Court (ICC) over its efforts to prosecute America and its allies, primarily Israel. The order 'places financial and visa sanctions' on all ICC personnel, as well as their families, according to information provided by the White House. Trump’s order closely mirrors congressional legislation that overwhelmingly passed the GOP-controlled House in January. The bill stalled in the Senate, however, when all but one Democratic member, Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman, voted against it. Like Congress’s bill, Trump’s order authorizes far-reaching sanctions on the ICC and those who assist it in investigating U.S. citizens and allies, according to a White House fact sheet reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. The court has faced widespread GOP criticism for issuing an arrest warrant on Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is in Washington, D.C., through Sunday for meetings with the White House and Congress. 'By issuing arrest warrants for Israeli officials and Hamas officials at the same time, the ICC created a shameful moral equivalency,' the White House wrote in its fact sheet on the executive order. 'The ICC consistently constrains liberal, democratic nations like Israel in exercising their rights to self-defense.' Trump, the fact sheet adds, 'will not support an organization that unfairly targets U.S. citizens and our allies.' Neither Israel nor the United States recognize the ICC’s jurisdiction. Trump nonetheless applied both financial sanctions and visa restrictions on its members, measures that will effectively bar ICC officials, as well as their family members, from entering the United States and cut off their access to some financial networks. The sanctions, the White House said, are in direct response to the 'ICC’s biased attacks on the U.S. and Israel.' Trump’s decision to sign the order while Netanyahu is in town reflects the White House’s drive to strengthen the U.S.-Israel alliance after four years of tension under Joe Biden. 'The ICC’s disproportionate focus on Israel, without investigating the actions of groups that openly call for Israel’s destruction, reveals a clear double standard,' the fact sheet adds. It also points out that while the ICC pursues Israel, it has done little to combat the Iranian regime’s mass human rights abuses. The court spends more than $2 billion a year investigating countries like Israel, but has conducted 'less than 10 successful prosecutions,' according to the White House. The Rome Statute, an international treaty that established the ICC in 1998, grants the court and its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, 'unaccountable powers that pose a significant threat to United States sovereignty and our constitutional protections,' the White House said in justifying the sanctions. Thursday’s executive order continues a tough stance toward the court that started during Trump’s first term in office. In 2020, Trump initiated an asset freeze and entry ban on ICC officials after the court began investigating alleged American war crimes in Afghanistan. In November 2024, when the ICC first issued its arrest warrant for Netanyahu, the Israeli leader slammed the court, claiming its efforts signal a deep anti-Semitic bias.

‘Hypocrisy will be exposed’: Israeli defense chief calls out Spai...	Katz took issue with countries that have been vocal critics of Israel and portrayed themselves as staunch defenders of the Palestinians taking such a stance. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Thursday warned that the 'hypocrisy' of Spain, Ireland, and other European countries hostile to the Jewish state will be exposed if they do not take in Palestinians who choose to leave Gaza, the war-torn enclave that US President Donald Trump has said he intends to rebuild after the population resettles elsewhere for a unknown period of time. Katz called out several countries in Europe while announcing he had ordered the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to prepare a plan to allow Gaza residents who wish to leave to exit the enclave voluntarily. 'The people of Gaza should have the right to freedom of movement and migration, as is customary everywhere in the world,' Katz posted on X/Twitter. 'I welcome President Trump’s bold initiative, which can create extensive opportunities for those in Gaza who wish to leave, assist them in resettling in host countries, and support long-term reconstruction efforts in a demilitarized, threat-free Gaza after Hamas — an effort that will take many years.' He said his plan would include exit options via land crossings, as well as special arrangements for departure by sea and air, noting that the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, which controlled Gaza before the current war and remains the strongest faction there absent the Israeli army, has used residents as 'human shields' and and now 'holds them hostage.' Katz’s order came two days after Trump said that the US would take over Gaza and develop it economically after Palestinians are safely resettled elsewhere. I have instructed the IDF to prepare a plan that will allow any resident of Gaza who wishes to leave to do so, to any country willing to receive them. Hamas has used the residents of Gaza as human shields, built its terror infrastructure in the heart of the civilian population,… &mdash; ישראל כ'ץ Israel Katz (@Israel_katz) February 6, 2025 Global reaction to Trump’s plan was largely negative, with many countries expressing both incredulity and indignation. Spain, for example, said that Palestinians must stay in Gaza. 'I want to be very clear on this: Gaza is the land of Gazan Palestinians and they must stay in Gaza,' Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told reporters on Wednesday. 'Gaza is part of the future Palestinian state Spain supports and has to coexist guaranteeing the Israeli state’s prosperity and safety.' Katz took issue with countries that have been vocal critics of Israel and portrayed themselves as staunch defenders of the Palestinians taking such a stance. 'Countries such as Spain, Ireland, Norway, and others, which have falsely accused Israel over its actions in Gaza, are legally obligated to allow Gazans to enter their territory,' Katz said in his social media post. 'Their hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse. Meanwhile, countries like Canada, which has a structured immigration program, have previously expressed willingness to take in residents from Gaza.' Albares rejected Katz’s suggestion that Spain should accept displaced Palestinians. 'Gazans’ land is Gaza and Gaza must be part of the future Palestinian state,' Albares said in an interview with Spanish radio station RNE. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Irish Foreign Ministry told the Turkish state-run Anadolu Agency on Thursday that Katz’s post was 'unhelpful and a source of distraction,' adding, 'The objective must be that the people of Palestine return safely to their home.' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said during a press conference on Wednesday that Gaza under Hamas rule has been a 'failed experiment, adding, 'As long as immigration is voluntary and there is a country willing to accept them, can anyone really say it’s immoral or inhumane?' 'עזה זה ניסוי שנכשל' - שר החוץ גדעון סער נואם במליאה: 'כל עוד הגירה מתבצעת מרצונו החופשי של אדם, וכל עוד יש מדינה שמוכנה לקלוט את אותו אדם, מישהו יכול להגיד שזה לא מוסרי ולא אנושי?' @gidonsaar pic.twitter.com/VxNy7jSdZC &mdash; ערוץ כנסת (@KnessetT) February 5, 2025 Since Hamas started the Gaza war with its invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, both Spain and Ireland have been fierce critics of the Jewish state. In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 atrocities, Spain launched a diplomatic campaign to curb Israel’s military response. At the same time, several Spanish ministers in the country’s left-wing coalition government issued pro-Hamas statements and called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, with some falsely accusing Israel of 'genocide.' More recently, Spanish officials said they would not allow ships carrying arms for Israel to stop at its ports. The US Federal Maritime Commission recently opened an investigation into whether Spain, a NATO ally, has been denying port entry to cargo vessels reportedly transporting US weapons to Israel. Spain stopped its own defense companies from shipping arms to Israel in October 2023. One year later, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez urged other members of the EU to suspend the bloc’s free trade agreement with Israel over its military campaigns against Hamas in Gaza and the terrorist organization Hezbollah in Lebanon. Sanchez’s demand came three days after the Spanish premier urged other countries to stop supplying weapons to the Jewish state. In Ireland, meanwhile, President Michael D. Higgins used his platform speaking at a Holocaust commemoration last month to launch a tirade against Israel’s military campaign targeting Hamas terrorists, appearing to draw parallels between Israel’s war in Gaza and the Nazi genocide of Jews during the Holocaust. The speech came against a backdrop of strained Irish-Israeli relations, exacerbated by Ireland’s decision to join South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and its support for redefining genocide in order to secure a conviction against Jerusalem. In December, Israel announced it was shuttering its embassy in Dublin, accusing the Irish government of undermining Israel at international forums and promoting 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' Last month, Israel announced it was shuttering its embassy in Dublin, accusing the Irish government of undermining Israel at international forums and promoting 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' In October, Irish leaders called on the EU to 'review its trade relations' with Israel after the Israeli parliament passed legislation banning the activities in the country of UNRWA, the United Nations agency responsible for Palestinian refugees, because of its ties to Hamas. Spain and Ireland, along with Norway, officially recognized a Palestinian state in May, claiming the move was accelerated by the Israel-Hamas war and would help foster a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli officials described the decision as a 'reward for terrorism.'

Musk’s Nazi-like salute sends Tesla into tailspin	In California, traditionally a Tesla stronghold, sales declined by 8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a concerning 12% drop for the entire year. By Jewish Breaking News Tesla is grappling with mounting consumer backlash over CEO Elon Musk’s Nazi-like salute. In Europe, where Tesla has significant market presence, the response has been particularly fierce. Outside Barcelona, French artist James Kina installed a provocative red raised arm at a Tesla charging station. Last month in Germany, activists projected images of Musk’s gesture onto the company’s Gigafactory near Berlin, accompanied by the word 'Heil' in reference to the Holocaust’s architect Adolf Hitler. Authorities have since launched a criminal investigation under the country’s strict laws against Nazi symbolism. The firestorm kicked off during a post-inauguration celebration at Capital One Arena when Musk thanked MAGA supporters by touching his chest and raising an arm in a Nazi salute-like fashion. Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s defense of the tech tycoon, Musk didn’t do himself any favors after responding to the criticism with a series of Holocaust-related puns on his social media platform X. 'Don’t say Hess to Nazi accusations!' Musk wrote on Thursday. 'Some people will Goebbels anything down!' Musk wrote. 'Stop Göring your enemies! His pronouns would’ve been He/Himmler!' he continued. 'Bet you did nazi that coming.' Tesla can’t afford any more erratic behavior from their boss. According to Bloomberg, the electric vehicle giant is seeing sales plummeting across major global markets for the first time in over a decade. In California, traditionally a Tesla stronghold, sales declined by 8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a concerning 12% drop for the entire year. Even registrations for Tesla’s crown jewel, its Model 3, has fallen by more than a third in the state. Meanwhile, France has seen a staggering 63% year- decline in Tesla sales last year, and in Sweden and Norway, the company is reporting significant market share losses despite overall strong car sales in the region.

Pohutsky, who has promoted herself as the first openly bisexual member of the Michigan House, on Thursday took to X to claim that 'many men' are not happy with her decision. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon A Democratic Michigan state representative told protesters Wednesday that she underwent voluntary sterilization to avoid becoming pregnant during President Donald Trump's second term, a left-wing media outlet reported. 'Just under two weeks ago, I underwent surgery to ensure that I would never have to navigate a pregnancy in Donald Trump's America,' Rep. Laurie Pohutsky told anti-Trump protesters gathered Wednesday outside the Michigan Capitol, according to a piece published by the Michigan Advance. 'I refuse to let my body be treated as currency by an administration that only sees value in my ability to procreate.' Trump has maintained that abortion policy should be left to state legislatures, such as the Michigan House of Representatives. Pohutsky is a member of the Michigan House and served for two years as speaker pro tempore. Pohutsky insisted that her surgery was important, telling protesters, 'If you know people who are questioning how serious this is, I'm going to repeat myself: A sitting government official opted for voluntary sterilization because she was uncertain she would be able to access contraception in the future.' Pohutsky, who has promoted herself as the first openly bisexual member of the Michigan House, on Thursday took to X to claim that 'many men' are not happy with her decision. 'Oh my… it would seem that many men with profile photos of other people have read the news and are not very happy with me today,' the state representative wrote. 'So anyway, who else is excited for the new Lady Gaga album?' Commenters seemed similarly excited, with one writing, 'The gene pool breathes a sigh of relief.' The Advance is part of States Newsroom, a network of center-left webpages that claims to focus on local issues. While the network may appear grassroots, donors include the Rockefeller family and foreign billionaire Hansjörg Wyss. It was launched with the backing of a group called the Hopewell Fund, which was in turn managed by left-wing dark-money behemoth Arabella Advisors.

Standing together: Rep. Brian Mast meets wounded IDF soldier Ari ...	Mast, a U.S. Army veteran, lost both legs and a finger in 2010 while clearing explosives during an operation with the Army Rangers in Kandahar. By Jewish Breaking News Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL), Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, met with IDF soldier Ari Spitz, a fellow war amputee who lost both legs while fighting in Gaza. Spitz a member of the Givaati Brigade is one of the most seriously injured Israeli soldiers to survive his wounds, spent six weeks recovering in hospital care. He shared details of their meeting on social media, writing: 'Yesterday I had the privilege of meeting the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Brian Mast. Besides his important role, he also lost both his legs as a soldier in Afghanistan. We spoke of prosthetics, politics, and the future. I thanked him for his longstanding support of Israel and the Jewish people as a public servant. It is always a pleasure to draw inspiration from people who have made a remarkable recovery.' Mast, a U.S. Army veteran, lost both legs and a finger in 2010 while clearing explosives during an operation with the Army Rangers in Kandahar. He was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart for his service. A staunch advocate for Israel, Mast previously volunteered with the IDF’s Sar-El program, assisting with logistics near Tel Aviv. Following the October 7th massacre, he arrived in Congress wearing an IDF uniform, posting on social media: 'As the only member to serve with both the United States Army and the Israel Defense Forces, I will always stand with Israel.' He also took a direct jab at Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), adding: 'Tlaib’s got her flag. I got my uniform.' The meeting between Mast and Spitz highlights the deep personal and political ties between the U.S. and Israel, as both men continue to advocate for strong U.S.-Israel relations.

Israel prepares for possible tsunami following earthquakes in Gre...	Thousands of small earthquakes in the Santorini Islands in recent days have raised concerns about the potential for a larger earthquake in the region, which could lead to a tsunami in the Mediterranean. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's National Security Council has warned of the risk of a tsunami following a series of earthquakes in Greece. The National Security Council met on Wednesday with emergency agencies and government ministries to discuss preparations for a possible tsunami scenario. Concerns were raised due to the high risk of tsunamis following the increased seismic activity recently observed in Greece. Thousands of small earthquakes in the Santorini Islands in recent days have raised concerns about the potential for a larger earthquake in the region, which could lead to a tsunami in the Mediterranean. Ariel Heimann, a senior geologist at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), described the concern over the seismic activity in Santorini and said, 'Approximately 2,000 earthquakes have occurred in Santorini over the past week, with the strongest measuring between 4 and 5.3 in magnitude, including 24 in the past 24 hours.' He added, 'Such a cluster of earthquakes could precede a major earthquake that may occur soon. However, there is also a considerable possibility that after a period of such seismic activity, the phenomenon will subside, and calm will return.' Santorini is 1,200 km from Israel, but since the earthquakes that generate tsunamis occur in the sea, powerful waves could reach Israel. 'A tsunami wave takes time to travel across the Mediterranean. Even if an earthquake triggers one, there would be enough time to issue a warning before it reaches the shore. Therefore, we should remain vigilant but not panic. This serves as a reminder that a major earthquake in Israel is not a matter of if, but when—making it essential to prepare for this threat,' he said. Israel is included in a tsunami warning system that issues alerts as soon as severe storms are detected. In areas along Israel's coast, sensors are installed to protect the public. Tsunamis take the form of long, powerful waves that hit the shore with tremendous impact. They can last for hours, with waves continuing to add strength as they hit the shore. Flooding can last for hours or even days. When a tsunami is detected, residents are alerted and warned to evacuate, with routes mapped out and made available to the public. In cities such as Haifa, signs indicate evacuation plans and safe routes. Officials often recommend that residents evacuate on foot rather than in cars to leave the roads clear for emergency vehicles.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Foreign Ministries of Spain and Ireland rejected Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz’s suggestion that they accept Palestinians displaced from Gaza. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares dismissed the idea, stating, 'No one should even be debating where Palestinians in Gaza should go, because that debate is closed.' He added, 'Palestinians’ homeland is Gaza. Gaza should be part of the future Palestinian state, as recognized by Spain and most nations worldwide.' Albares emphasized Spain’s support for humanitarian aid and Gaza’s reconstruction. 'The EU has made clear its support for a two-state solution,' he stressed. Ireland’s Foreign Ministry called Katz’s proposal 'unhelpful and a source of distraction.' 'The priority must be a massive scale-up of aid to Gaza, the restoration of basic services, and a clear framework for displaced residents to return,' the ministry stated. The Spanish and Irish ministries were responding to comments from Katz, who told reporters, 'Countries like Spain, Ireland, Norway, and others, which have leveled accusations and false claims against Israel over its actions in Gaza, are legally obligated to allow any Gaza resident to enter their territories.' Katz made these remarks after instructing the IDF to assist civilians leaving Gaza by land, sea, and air. He also expressed support for Donald Trump’s plan to relocate Gazans. Spain, Ireland, and Norway had unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state, and Spain halted all weapons exports to Israel. In response, Israel’s Foreign Ministry immediately proposed recalling its ambassadors from Norway, Ireland, and Spain. During a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, Trump proposed relocating Palestinian civilians from Gaza to other countries and having the U.S. assume control of the territory during its reconstruction. On Wednesday, the White House clarified some details of the plan, appearing to contradict Trump’s Tuesday claim that the resettlement would be permanent. 'I can confirm that the president is committed to rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating those who are there because … it is a demolition site,' White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. Leavitt also stated that under Trump’s plan, the U.S. would neither fund Gaza’s reconstruction nor deploy military forces to the area. 'This does not mean U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza, nor does it mean American taxpayers will fund the effort,' she said. 'Instead, it means that Donald Trump, known for his negotiation skills, will work to secure an agreement with regional partners.'

Trump remarks on Gaza not cause for Democrat freakout, Fetterman ...	To Fetterman, no one is being honest about the devastation on the ground in Gaza and the need to move citizens out in the short term. By Menachem Wecker, JNS As many of his Democratic peers in Congress respond very vocally to everything that U.S. President Donald Trump says, Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) thinks it is essential to choose one’s battles carefully, the pro-Israel senator told Tara Palmeri on her podcast Somebody’s Gotta Win. 'When the pitcher is throwing thousands of balls, you have to decide which ones are the strikes to swing on and to push back and to fight against,' Fetterman told Palmeri, senior political correspondent at Puck. 'Many of my colleagues—we’re a little over two weeks in—and now they’re in full on freakout, and now they’ve got the signs and they’re going out, ‘Ahhhh.’ ‘Hey, let’s grab a bullhorn and go into a Starbucks and start yelling,’' Fetterman said. (Fetterman has been regaining his clarity of speech since suffering a stroke in 2022.) Palmeri asked the senator about what her sources have told her, that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner had put forth a plan to develop Gaza. What if that development benefits the Trump family, she asked. 'I don’t personally believe that they are going to turn Gaza into Trump Plaza kind of a situation,' Fetterman said. He added that he thought it was 'silly' for Trump to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, but said that he doesn’t think such name changes really matter. 'You can be concerned,' he said about Democrats responding to the president’s many comments. 'When you have used the extreme language in your portfolio of ‘fascist’ and now they’re throwing around that this is a ‘coup,’' he said. 'I’ve studied what coups really were, and I’ve studied what some of these things were, and right now this is sound and fury, and thus far at least it really hasn’t created any lasting damage or anything serious about it.' Where colleagues can’t resist reacting to Trump, 'I’m not that guy,' Fetterman told Palmeri, in the interview which ran about 45 minutes. 'You have to choose which thing you’re going to go back at and then other things that you’re going to ignore.' Palmeri told JNS that she had a preplanned interview with Fetterman, but knowing he is an 'ardent supporter of Israel,' she wanted to get his reaction to Trump’s proposal about Gaza. 'Unlike many members of Trump’s own party, he seemed open to it,' she told JNS. 'I think his views on Israel are probably more in line with the state that he represents, a battleground state, that Donald Trump won,' she added. 'Israel was a major wedge for Democrats during the election, and Fetterman has been one of the lone voices in his party that has had unwavering support for Israel.' ‘Gigantic kind of undertaking’ The senator said that Trump’s plan for the United States to take over Gaza is 'provocative.' 'But I don’t think that that’s in an actual serious kind of a way, and I think, I mean I can’t speak exactly what he meant, but what I think it was more to kind of shake things up and to start like a very more honest conversation of Gaza,' he said, 'and how 90% of the housing has been destroyed or severely damaged, and where are you going to live?' There are no utilities, water or structures to protect Gazans from the weather, according to Fetterman. 'Where are they going to go? Where are they going to live? How are they going to do that in a hygienic kind of way, and how are you going to rebuild it, especially when Hamas is still allowed to function,' he told Palmeri. 'Where’s the money gonna come from? And who is going to be doing all the building and do all that work?' he added. 'I mean that’s a gigantic kind of undertaking, and now no one has been honest about it.' Fetterman added that his top priority in the region is destroying Iran’s nuclear facilities. 'We have a unique opportunity to do that knowing that now, that Hamas is severely damaged, and so is Hezbollah severely diminished and Iran,' he said. 'It has actually been shown that Iran doesn’t have the capabilities to really project those kinds of damage and they are not as fearsome as people thought that they were.' 'All of the experts on the Middle East throughout all of this were wrong,' he added. 'For me, my top priority in that region is destroying Iran’s nuclear facilities.' The senator said he doesn’t think U.S. troops will be on the ground in Gaza. Instead, he thinks Washington must 'hold Hamas and Iran and the region—the whole region—accountable.' The Jewish state reminded that Hamas by design 'hides in things like schools and refugee camps and those things, and they forced Israel to fight through civilians.' 'They were forced to fight a war through civilians. I have never described Palestinians as a necessary sacrifice,' he said. 'The Palestinian leaders describe that, and they design that to maximize the most amount of death and hoping that they can bring everyone into the region into the war, when Israel actually demonstrated that Iran really isn’t the kind of powerful force in the region.' 'All those proxies really aren’t much of much,' he said. To Fetterman, no one is being honest about the devastation on the ground in Gaza and the need to move citizens out in the short term. 'If you’re returning to an absolute pile of rubble, then it’s like that’s not an honest one. Gaza is going to need to be rebuilt, and how do you rebuild that if Hamas is in power?' he told Palmeri. 'Because when they’ve built Gaza, they stole those resources and built those tunnels and bought those kind of weapons that they turned on Israel on Oct. 7. No one is being honest and no one is reacting to the reality on the ground.' Palmeri asked if Trump’s plan could jeopardize the ceasefire agreement. Hamas is 'very eager' for a ceasefire, and Hezbollah and Iran are 'begging' for ceasefire, Fetterman said.

Biden State Dept privately downplayed use of ‘jihad’ and ‘occupat...	The memo offers a fresh window into the Biden administration's decision to restore funding to UNRWA—one that shows the Biden State Department was well aware of the issues plaguing the embattled relief agency but opted to barrel forward with funds anyway. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon When the Biden administration resumed funding to the United Nations relief agency for Gaza, it penned an internal memo aimed at defending UNRWA over its production of childhood 'educational materials' that encourage violence and demonize Israel. Some of those materials included references to 'jihad' and Israeli 'occupation'—terms that the Biden State Department wrote are 'in line with U.N. principles' and only 'viewed as inappropriate by some other audiences.' The memo, obtained by the Washington Free Beacon through a records request from watchdog group Protect the Public Trust, came roughly two weeks after the Biden administration restored tens of millions of dollars in funding to UNRWA in April 2021 following a pause during President Donald Trump's first stint in the White House. Written by deputy assistant secretary Nancy Izzo Jackson for Secretary of State Antony Blinken, it addressed 'examples of criticism' targeting UNRWA and laid out the State Department's 'response.' The first section, titled, 'Educational Materials,' notes that UNRWA made 'home-learning 'cards,' based on the Palestinian Authority's educational curriculum, to supplement textbooks sent home' during the COVID pandemic. Some of those cards, according to a January 2021 report from research firm Impact-se, included the 'encouragement of violence' and accused Israel 'of deliberately dumping radioactive and toxic waste in the West Bank.' UNRWA, the State Department wrote, had already removed or changed the content before the report's release. Shortly thereafter, however, Impact-se issued a follow-up report that identified additional 'problematic cards,' including 'references to jihad in and violence in Arabic language lessons for grades 6 and 9,' as well as references to 'the Israeli occupation.' UNRWA determined that those terms did not violate 'U.N. principles,' according to the State Department memo, which states that only 'some other audiences' may object to them. 'UNRWA removed or updated four cards while retaining a dozen cards it deemed as in line with U.N. principles (e.g. use of 'jihad' in the Quran or the term 'occupation') but are viewed as inappropriate by some other audiences,' the State Department said. The memo offers a fresh window into the Biden administration's decision to restore funding to UNRWA—one that shows the Biden State Department was well aware of the issues plaguing the embattled relief agency but opted to barrel forward with funds anyway. It came just two months before the State Department privately assessed that Hamas was likely to benefit from more than $360 million in additional aid. Those private assessments did not square with the administration's public one. When announcing the funding restoration, Blinken said the assistance 'serves important U.S. interests,' including 'Israeli-Palestinian understanding.' Behind closed doors, however, the State Department acknowledged concerns that UNRWA’s facilities are used by 'terrorist groups' like Hamas. Its memo referenced the 2020 discovery of tunnels beneath an UNRWA school and facility but said it remained 'unknown which entity is responsible' for them. Hamas, in the lead up to Oct. 7 and after it, relied heavily on a sophisticated tunnel system built beneath the Gaza Strip. Many of these networks connected to UNRWA schools, which were also used as Hamas military outposts. UNRWA, the State Department maintained in its memo, 'has been very transparent with the Israeli Ministry of Defense and with the United States when any such incidents occur.' In a separate report prepared for Congress in 2021, the State Department documented 'violations of UNRWA’s neutrality policies that are not consistent with the principle of neutrality.' This included 'slogans, graffiti, or other imagery on the inside or outside of UNRWA facilities.' More than 247 infractions were reported from 2019 to 2020 alone, the report states. The report also noted that, despite a 'strict no-arms policy' at all UNRWA facilities, the agency had reported 'armed incursions, armed incidents, unauthorized use of UNRWA installations, weapons, and tunnels.' To address these concerns, the State Department proposed sending even more money to UNRWA so that it could train staff how to uphold the 'principles of neutrality, tolerance, anti-discrimination, and human rights.' Michael Chamberlain, Protect the Public’s Trust’s director, said the newly unearthed State Department documents highlight how the former administration 'tried to sell a wholly unrealistic version of UNRWA to Congress.' 'Even with all they knew, they shrugged and wrote the checks anyway,' he told the Free Beacon. 'All the post-Oct. 7 reports about UNRWA staff participating in terrorist attacks and terror groups storing war materiel in UNRWA facilities were not surprising to anyone paying attention—not even to the officials in charge of the decision to resume sending money to this organization.' While UNRWA’s ties to terrorism have long generated concerns in Congress, it was not until Oct. 7 that these issues hit the mainstream. At least 19 UNRWA staff members participated in Hamas’s terror spree, leading the Biden administration and international donors to pause their funding. Israel maintains that many more helped Hamas hide hostages and gave it access to UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip. Israel formally banned UNRWA late last month, citing its role in the Oct. 7 attacks. Israeli officials are now barred from working with the aid agency and the country seeks an alternative route to provide aid in the Gaza Strip.

Hamas urges Arab countries to resist Trump’s Gaza relocation plan	Hamas urged Arab nations to convene an emergency summit to discuss strategies for countering what it called Trump's 'displacement project.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas issued a statement on Thursday calling on Arab countries to reject U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza and assume control of the territory during the reconstruction process. The terror group also urged Arab nations to convene an emergency summit to discuss strategies for countering what it called Trump's 'displacement project.' Hamas stated that the president's remarks regarding Washington's stance on the Gaza Strip amounted to a declaration of the U.S.'s intent to occupy the territory. 'We do not need any nation to govern the Gaza Strip, and we reject replacing one occupation with another,' the group added. 'We urge Arab countries to resist pressure from Trump and stand firm in rejecting the displacement plan,' Hamas said. On Tuesday, during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump announced that his administration intends to relocate the entire population of the Gaza Strip to third-party countries, with the U.S. assuming control of the coastal enclave for rehabilitation and reconstruction. The proposal received praise from many Israeli leaders and congressional Republicans but drew strong criticism from the Arab world, several European governments, and some Democratic lawmakers. On Wednesday, the White House clarified some details of the plan, appearing to contradict Trump's Tuesday claim that the resettlement would be permanent. 'I can confirm that the president is committed to rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating those who are there because … it is a demolition site,' White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. Leavitt also stated that under Trump's plan, the U.S. will neither fund Gaza’s reconstruction nor deploy military forces to the area. 'This does not mean U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza, nor does it mean American taxpayers will fund the effort,' she said. 'Instead, it means that Donald Trump, known for his negotiation skills, will work to secure an agreement with regional partners.'

Israel thwarts Palestinian suicide bombing on Jerusalem bus	Several members of the cell were also involved in shooting attacks against Israeli soldiers in the past year. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli security forces thwarted a suicide bombing attack against a bus in Jerusalem, the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) announced on Thursday. Members of a terror cell made up of Fatah and Hamas operatives from Ramallah were arrested in November and December, the Shin Bet said. The suspects were identified as Mander Sheikh Qassem, Bashir Awad, Omar Sobakh, Ali Shweiki and Ahmed Jasser Ali. It emerged that the latter, with help from the rest of the cell, manufactured an explosive device to be used in a suicide bombing on a bus in Jerusalem. Investigators confiscated an explosive device that the cell intended to use to test their remote detonation mechanism. Also seized was a Carlo-type rifle. Several members of the cell were also involved in shooting attacks against Israeli soldiers in the past year. Since the October 7 attacks, Israeli forces have arrested 6,000 wanted Palestinians in counterterror operations in Judea and Samaria. Around 40 percent were affiliated with Hamas.

Israeli army to prepare plan allowing Gazans to voluntarily leave...	A Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research survey published on June 26, 2024, found that 44% of Gazans ages 18-29 would emigrate if given the chance. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the military to prepare a plan allowing Gazans to leave the enclave voluntarily, he announced on Thursday. The initiative would establish options for departure through land crossings, as well as via air and sea, Katz said. His announcement follows US President Donald Trump’s suggestion on Tuesday that the Strip’s residents relocate to third countries while Gaza is rebuilt. Katz accused Hamas of using Gazans as human shields, diverting humanitarian aid for its own purposes, and preventing residents from leaving the Strip. He argued that Gazans should have the same right to emigrate as people anywhere in the world. 'Countries like Spain, Ireland, and Norway, which have falsely accused Israel over its actions in Gaza, have a legal duty to allow Gazans to enter their territory,' Katz said, adding that refusal to do so would expose their 'hypocrisy.' He also pointed to Canada as a potential destination, citing its structured immigration program and past willingness to accept Gazan refugees. The Defense Minister stated that Hamas continues to exploit civilians and restrict their movement. 'Hamas used Gaza residents as human shields, built terror infrastructure in the heart of the population, and is now extorting them by using humanitarian aid while preventing them from leaving,' he said. Details of Trump’s suggestion have not been worked out, but any Gazan who wishes to emigrate would be able to do so, provided another country agrees to take them in. Katz believes such a move could pave the way for Gaza’s long-term rehabilitation once Hamas is no longer in control. 'Gaza’s residents should be allowed the freedom to exit and emigrate, as is the practice anywhere in the world,' Katz stressed. He added that Trump’s plan could help support a future demilitarized Gaza, though such a transition would take years. 'It does appear that President Trump is committed to the idea. He has the ability, if he wants to, to twist Jordan’s arm, to twist Egypt’s arm. Jordan is so dependent economically on the US and free trade with the US – which is more beneficial to Jordan than the US – that if President Trump really wants to make this happen, the US has the power to make it happen,' Asher Fredman, executive director of the Misgav Institute in Jerusalem told TPS-IL. Fredman said that despite the public Palestinian rhetoric, many Gazans do want to leave Gaza. He cited a Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research survey published on June 26, 2024, which found that 44% of Gazans ages 18-29 would emigrate if given the chance. The reported noted, 'Among those [of all ages] who have considered emigrating, 30% say they would do so even if they did not have the required papers.' A 2022 report, written by the Hamas-affiliated Council on International Relations and seen by TPS-IL, said 12% of the Strip’s population fled since 2007, when the terror group violently seized control of Gaza. The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how many are alive. So far, 18 hostages — 13 Israelis and five Thais — have been released. The fate of the remaining 65 hostages will be determined by negotiations during the ceasefire’s second phase. Critics say the phased approach condemns hostages not freed in the beginning to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 79 remaining hostages, 35 have been declared dead.

Israel to cease participation in UN human rights council	Israel remains the only nation regarding which the body has a dedicated agenda item, which Sa’ar said was clear evidence of institutional bias. By Ariel Kahana, JNS Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar announced on Wednesday that Israel will follow the example set by U.S. President Donald Trump and cease its engagement with the United Nations Human Rights Council. While neither are members of the council, both have informal observer status. In a pointed critique, Sa’ar characterized the council as a platform that systematically undermines Israel’s diplomatic standing while failing to address genuine human rights concerns globally. The Israeli foreign minister went on to state that the council serves as a mechanism for protecting human rights violators, enabling them to evade international scrutiny. He specifically condemned the UNHRC for 'obsessively demonizing the one democracy in the Middle East—Israel,' rather than genuinely addressing global human rights challenges. Sa’ar noted that the council has passed more than 100 resolutions against the Jewish state—more than 20% of all council resolutions, surpassing the combined total of resolutions against Iran, Cuba, North Korea and Venezuela. Moreover, Israel remains the only nation regarding which the body has a dedicated agenda item, which Sa’ar said was clear evidence of institutional bias. Sa’ar’s announcement reflects a broader strategy of challenging what Israel perceives as systemic discrimination within multilateral institutions.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lavishes praise on Donald Trump, calling him the 'best friend Israel has ever had in the White House,' and lauds Gaza resettlement plan as the 'first good idea' he has heard on Gaza's future. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed President Donald Trump’s Gaza resettlement plan on Wednesday, calling the proposal the first 'good idea' he has heard on the subject of the post-war administration of the Gaza Strip. Speaking on Fox News with Sean Hannity on Wednesday, Netanyahu discussed his meeting with President Trump a day earlier in the White House, including his comment to the president that he is 'the greatest friend Israel's ever had in the White House.' 'It's that simple,' Netanyahu told Hannity. 'He's the greatest friend Israel ever had in the White House. You know, in his first term, he recognized Jerusalem as our capital and moved the American embassy there, recognized our sovereignty over the Golan Heights, got out of the disastrous Iran deal, and we worked together on the historic Abraham Accords that brought peace to Israel and four Arab states.' Netanyahu lavished praise on Trump for his 'remarkable' accomplishments during the first few weeks of his second term, including the removal of limits on arms shipments imposed by the Biden administration, the defunding of UNRWA, and most recently, the president’s plan to resettle the population of Gaza and administer the coastal enclave after the current war. The Israeli premier called the plan the 'first good idea' that he has heard on the question of managing post-war Gaza. 'Well, I don't think he talked about sending US troops to complete the job of destroying Hamas,' continued Netanyahu. 'That's our commitment. That's our job. And we're absolutely committed to it. And I also don't think he said that he's going to fund it. He said that neighboring states, wealthy states, would do it. But the actual idea of allowing first Gazans who want to leave to leave, I mean, what's wrong with that? They can leave, they can then come back, they can relocate and come back, but you have to rebuild Gaza.' 'This is the first good idea that I've heard. It's a remarkable idea. And I think it should be really examined, pursued and done, because I think it will create a different future for everyone.' Netanyahu seemed to indicate that the war against Hamas would resume after the current truce, vowing to eliminate Hamas’ military capabilities. 'So far, we've decimated most of Hamas' military power. Not all. There's some left, and we'll make sure that it's not there when this war ends, and it could end very quickly. Second, we've released so far about 70 percent, more than that actually, of the living hostages, which nobody believed we would do.'

White House appears to walk back Trump's claim that resettlement of Gazans will be permanent, as president defends plan, saying no American troops would be deployed to Gaza. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump defended his Gaza resettlement plan Thursday, emphasizing that no American soldiers will be deployed to the Gaza Strip, while the White House appeared to walk back a key feature of Trump's plan. On Tuesday, Trump told reporters at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that his administration plans to resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip in third-party countrie, with the U.S. taking control over the coastal enclave for its rehabilitation and reconstruction. The plan drew praise from many Israeli leaders and congressional Republicans, but sharp criticism from the Arab world, a number of European governments, and some Democratic lawmakers. On Wednesday, the White House clarified some details of the plan, and appeared to directly contradict Trump's claim Tuesday that the resettlement would be permanent. 'I can confirm that the President is committed to rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating those who are there, because &#8230; it is a demolition site,' White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. Leavitt also said the U.S. will not pay for Gaza's reconstruction under the Trump plan, nor will American military forces be deployed to the area. 'That does not mean boots on the ground in Gaza. It does not mean American taxpayers will be funding this effort,' she said. 'It means Donald Trump, who is the best deal maker on the planet, is going to strike a deal with our partners in the region.' On Thursday, Trump himself addressed questions regarding his Gaza plan in a post to the Truth Social platform. The president claimed that Israel will 'turn over' the Gaza Strip to the U.S., but no American forces will be sent to Gaza. 'The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting,' Trump wrote. 'The U.S., working with great development teams from all over the World, would slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth. No soldiers by the U.S. would be needed! Stability for the region would reign!!!'

Democratic lawmaker calls for Trump's impeachment, after the president proposed relocating Gaza's population to third-party countries, calling the plan 'ethnic cleansing.' By World Israel News Staff A Democratic lawmaker in the U.S. House of Representatives announced plans Wednesday to submit articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump over the president's plan to relocate en masse the entire population of the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday, President Trump spoke at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, unveiling his plan for facilitating the mass migration of Gazans and bringing the coastal enclave under American control. A day later, Rep. Al Green of Texas addressed the House floor, accusing Trump of promoting 'ethnic cleansing,' and thus a 'crime against humanity,' arguing that it was sufficient basis to remove him from office. 'Ethnic cleansing in Gaza is not a joke,' Green told the House, 'especially when it emanates from the President of the United States. The most powerful person in the world. When he has the ability to perfect what he says.' Green slammed Prime Minister Netanyahu for not distancing himself from Trump's plan. 'Ethnic cleansing in Gaza is no joke and the Prime Minister of Israel should be ashamed, knowing the history of his people, to stand there and allow such things to be said.' 'Ethnic cleansing has been a crime against humanity and I stand here today to denounce what the president said, to denounce the complicity of the Prime Minister of Israel, and to remind people that Dr. King was right, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere and injustice in Gaza is a threat to justice in the United States of America.' Green vowed to bring articles of impeachment to Congress against Trump, without laying out a time frame for the beginning of the impeachment effort. 'I rise to announce, that the movement to impeach the President has begun. I rise to announce that I will bring articles of impeachment against the President for dastardly deeds proposed and dastardly deeds done. Green last year criticized Israel's handling of the war against the Hamas terror organization, accusing the IDF of engaging in an 'unjust, revengeful, might-makes-right offense.' 'No country can commit such atrocious injustices in the name of justice and expect the blessings of people of good will.'

Terrorists released by Israel leave prison as millionaires	In another society, if a criminal goes to jail for murdering someone, he’s ashamed about it. In the Palestinian Authority, they go around with a crown on their heads,' Itamar Marcus, Palestinian Media Watch’s founder and director, said. By David Isaac, JNS Many terrorists released by Israel are millionaires, flush with cash from years of receiving monthly Palestinian Authority 'pay for slay' stipends, an analysis by a Jerusalem-based watchdog group revealed on Wednesday. Palestinian Media Watch posted a list of all 734 terrorists scheduled for release from Israeli prisons in the first phase of the hostages-for-ceasefire agreement with Hamas, together with their 'salaries'—the dollar amounts each terrorist received from the Palestinian Authority’s so-called Martyrs’ Fund while incarcerated. In total, the terrorists received $141,837,087, or more than half a billion shekels. Of those, 316, or nearly half, received more than a million shekels. (Palestinian Media Watch created a program to crunch the numbers, inputting all the relevant P.A. criteria—crime, marital status, number of children, etc., to determine the size of their stipends.) 'It’s a tremendous force driving terror,' Itamar Marcus, Palestinian Media Watch’s founder and director, told JNS. First, it signals to Palestinians that these terrorists weren’t working in a vacuum, but were acting in the name of the P.A. Second, the wealth places the terrorists in an honored position in Palestinian society, in fact, 'Palestinian terrorists are the most honored people in Palestinian society,' he said. 'When they’re introduced, and in interviews, even years after they were released from jail, they’re called Asra ['Prisoner']. That’s their title. It’s like an ambassador. It’s actually similar to POW [prisoner of war]. They have a different word for criminal prisoners. For the P.A., they’re legitimate fighters, even if they killed women and children,' Marcus said. 'In another society, if a criminal goes to jail for murdering someone, he’s ashamed about it. In the Palestinian Authority, they go around with a crown on their heads,' he said. The P.A.’s ongoing 'pay-for-slay' program demonstrates that Israel’s efforts to curtail it have not succeeded. In July 2018, Israel, which collects tax and tariff revenue of behalf of the P.A., passed a law withholding those funds equal to the amount the P.A. paid to terrorists. The law aimed to put an end to the practice. The P.A. declared that payments would go on. P.A. President Mahmoud Abbas said in October 2019, 'The Martyrs and their families are sacred, [and so are] the wounded and the prisoners. We must pay all of them. If one penny remains in our hands it is for them and not for the living.' Abbas has made good on his pledge. Marcus told JNS that the P.A. has not paid its employees their full salaries—'at one point they skipped a whole month, which they’ve never made up'—to ensure imprisoned terrorists were paid in full. 'What’s outrageous, of course, is a person who’s living at home, working, who’s got five or six kids and needs the money—his salary you’re cutting to 70%. But the prisoner who’s getting everything—all his food and everything taken care of by Israel—that’s the one who’s getting 100%. So it’s just a message of values,' Marcus said. In response, Palestinian Media Watch spearheaded a campaign in 2020 together with the IDF to effect a change whereby much of Israel’s Anti-Terror Law would be applied to Judea and Samaria, 'rendering banks liable to punishment for facilitating P.A. terror salaries.' It worked to a degree. It sent the P.A. into crisis as it realized its banks would be exposed to international terror financing laws. 'According to the official statements that we got, 33,000 bank accounts were closed,' Marcus said. As a temporary workaround, the P.A. paid the terrorists’ families through the post office. (The families complained about the indignity of having to wait in line to receive their stipends, Marcus noted.) Then the P.A. opened a special bank dedicated solely to receiving the funds from the P.A. 'The only thing that this bank does is pay terrorist salaries,' he said. Marcus’s suggestion is to arrest anyone in the P.A. involved in the 'pay-for-slay' program, even if that means arresting the entire staff at the P.A.’s Ministry of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs. 'They should all be arrested, put in jail, charged. And that would stop it very quickly,' he said.

Israel nearly launched massive attack to destroy Hezbollah four d...	Top IDF brass and defense minister Yoav Gallant were for striking the more powerful enemy first. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel came very close to preemptively striking Hezbollah four days after the October 7, 2023 Hamas invasion in the belief that one should hit the more powerful enemy first, The Jerusalem Post reported Thursday. IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi was thinking about such an operation within minutes of the war breaking out in the south, the report said. Military intelligence brought him information about a potential complementary invasion from Lebanon by the much stronger Hezbollah forces, with concern growing steadily due to the Iranian proxy’s launch of dozens of missiles at northern Israel starting on October 8. Halevi held round after round of consultations with top subordinates such as Northern Command chief Uri Gordon and air force commander Tomer Bar, and told several people that it 'was too good an opportunity to miss,' and that 'if there are two enemies, you go after the stronger one first to avoid them taking you by surprise,' the report said. The chief of staff also contacted then-defense minister Yoav Gallant, who strongly supported the idea to get the jump on Hezbollah before it organized for a major attack. Both Halevi and Gallant met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the subject, although Gallant had a very hard time getting in to see Netanyahu and had to be content at first with speaking to the prime minister’s confidant, Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer. He made it clear to Dermer that Hezbollah had to be attacked now, and not doing so could lead to the opportunity being lost for a long time. Instead of bringing the defense minister to Netanyahu, Dermer called U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, which led to President Joe Biden talking directly to Netanyahu. Biden made the American position crystal clear, saying, 'Do not do this&#8230;. This is a mistake. Do not go down this road.' U.S. intelligence and the military strongly believed that the Israelis were reading Hezbollah’s actions incorrectly, that it had no plans for an invasion, and that a strike that would cripple the terror group would lead to a regional war. This opinion was conveyed to Dermer when Netanyahu actually interrupted a security cabinet meeting for the minister to call Sullivan again. The report said that Sullivan brought the top U.S. guns to convince Dermer, including then-secretary of state Antony Blinken, defense secretary Lloyd Austin, CIA director William Burns, director of national intelligence Avril Haines, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs CQ Brown. When Netanyahu, Gallant, Halevi and Dermer met after the call, the report said that the prime minister clearly voiced his disapproval of a strike. 'I am opposed,' he said.

Israel’s preemptive strike on Hezbollah that never materialized	Top IDF brass and defense minister Yoav Gallant were for striking the more powerful enemy first. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel came very close to preemptively striking Hezbollah four days after the October 7, 2023 Hamas invasion in the belief that one should hit the more powerful enemy first, The Jerusalem Post reported Thursday. IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi was thinking about such an operation within minutes of the war breaking out in the south, the report said. Military intelligence brought him information about a potential complementary invasion from Lebanon by the much stronger Hezbollah forces, with concern growing steadily due to the Iranian proxy’s launch of dozens of missiles at northern Israel starting on October 8. Halevi held round after round of consultations with top subordinates such as Northern Command chief Uri Gordon and air force commander Tomer Bar, and told several people that it 'was too good an opportunity to miss,' and that 'if there are two enemies, you go after the stronger one first to avoid them taking you by surprise,' the report said. The chief of staff also contacted then-defense minister Yoav Gallant, who strongly supported the idea to get the jump on Hezbollah before it organized for a major attack. Both Halevi and Gallant met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the subject, although Gallant had a very hard time getting in to see Netanyahu and had to be content at first with speaking to the prime minister’s confidant, Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer. He made it clear to Dermer that Hezbollah had to be attacked now, and not doing so could lead to the opportunity being lost for a long time. Instead of bringing the defense minister to Netanyahu, Dermer called U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, which led to President Joe Biden talking directly to Netanyahu. Biden made the American position crystal clear, saying, 'Do not do this&#8230;. This is a mistake. Do not go down this road.' U.S. intelligence and the military strongly believed that the Israelis were reading Hezbollah’s actions incorrectly, that it had no plans for an invasion, and that a strike that would cripple the terror group would lead to a regional war. This opinion was conveyed to Dermer when Netanyahu actually interrupted a security cabinet meeting for the minister to call Sullivan again. The report said that Sullivan brought the top U.S. guns to convince Dermer, including then-secretary of state Antony Blinken, defense secretary Lloyd Austin, CIA director William Burns, director of national intelligence Avril Haines, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs CQ Brown. When Netanyahu, Gallant, Halevi and Dermer met after the call, the report said that the prime minister clearly voiced his disapproval of a strike. 'I am opposed,' he said. 'We would face massive destruction on the home front. You see all of these buildings in Tel Aviv. They will all be destroyed. Hezbollah just has too many rockets. Also, we need the full backing of the Americans for invading Gaza.' He was also fearful, he said, that 'the blow to the Israeli home front will be so horrible that it will cause a deep demoralization.' When speaking to the security cabinet, Netanyahu focused on the political aspect, saying that Biden’s message to him had been 'that a [wrong] decision to significantly escalate the conflict with Hezbollah with a preemptive strike could radically alter Israeli-US relations.' He also received crucial support from Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, whose party joined the government in a show of national unity following the surprise invasion, and were in the cabinet.

Saudis deny Trump’s claims on Israel normalization, blast Gaza pl...	Riyadh pushes back on President Trump's claim that Saudi Arabia is willing to normalize ties with Israel without Palestinian statehood, while bashing president's Gaza relocation plan as 'fantasy of ethnic cleansing.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Saudi Arabia rebutted claims earlier this week by President Donald Trump that the oil-rich Islamic kingdom is willing to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel even without Jerusalem's backing for Palestinian statehood, saying Riyadh's insistence on a two-state solution remains 'firm and unwavering.' During his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, Trump responded to questions regarding the expansion of the Abraham Accords and normalization of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 'No, they're not,' Trump said, when asked whether the Saudis were still insisting Jerusalem back Palestinian statehood as a precondition for normalization. Publicly, Riyadh has for years conditioned recognition of Israel on Jerusalem's acceptance of a two-state solution. The Saudi Foreign Ministry reiterated that position Wednesday, issuing a statement denying Trump's claims. 'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirms that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering,' Riyadh said. 'His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, clearly and unequivocally reaffirmed this stance during his speech at&#8230;the Shura Council on September 18, 2024.' 'The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia emphasises that this unwavering position is non-negotiable and not subject to compromises. Achieving lasting and just peace is impossible without the Palestinian people obtaining their legitimate rights in accordance with international resolutions, as has been previously clarified to both the former and current US administrations.' Later on Wednesday, former Saudi intel chief Prince Turki al-Faisal appeared on CNN to condemn the president's plan, presented on Tuesday, to relocate Gazans en masse to third-party countries. The Saudi prince denounced the proposal as a 'fantasy' which would, if carried out, constitute 'ethnic cleansing' and promote 'more conflict and more bloodshed.' 'It is a fantasy to think that ethnic cleansing in the 21st century can be condoned by a world community that stays on its behinds and does not respond to that,' al Faisal said. 'The problem in Palestine is not the Palestinians. It is the Israeli occupation.' 'This has been clear and understood by everybody. Hence, you have United Nations resolutions calling for the quid pro quo of land for peace from 1967 until now.' 'The Arab Peace Initiative,' al Faisal cntinued, referencing the Saudi backed proposal, 'is based on that and offered Israel not only diplomatic relations, but all of the things that Israel wanted from trade, from normalization, etc., in return for the establishment of a Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem.' All of these things were American policy until this latest wording that Mr. Trump has chosen to use in claiming that he wants to do better things, when actually it is going to turn things into more conflict and more bloodshed.'

Pro-Trump Arab American group changes name after US president flo...	The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too,' Trump told reporters. 'We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site.' By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner A prominent organization that sought to forge strong ties between US President Donald Trump and the Arab American community has changed its name in opposition to Trump’s proposal for the US to 'take over' over Gaza. On Wednesday, 'Arab Americans for Trump' announced a rebrand to 'Arab Americans for Peace,' criticizing the president for his failure to hold meetings with 'key Arab leaders' and his support for removing 'Palestinian inhabitants to other parts of the Arab world.' 'We strongly appreciate the president’s offer to clean and rebuild Gaza. However, the purpose should be to make Gaza habitable for Palestinians and no one else,' the group said in a press release explaining the name change. The group explained that it supports a separate independent state for Palestinians encompassing Gaza, Judea and Samaria, and East Jerusalem, expressing disappointment that Trump has not attempted to carve out a 'path to a permanent peace process.' Bishara Bahbah, chairman of the group, told the Associated Press that the organization is 'completely opposed' to Trump’s suggestion to transfer Gaza’s civilians out of the coastal enclave. 'The talk about what the president wants to do with Gaza, obviously we’re completely opposed to the idea of the transfer of Palestinians from anywhere in historic Palestine,' Bahbah said. 'And so we did not want to be behind the curve in terms of pushing for peace, because that has been our objective from the very beginning.' On Tuesday night, Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was visiting the White House, held a press conference following their private meeting in the Oval Office. Trump asserted that the US would assume control of Gaza and develop it economically into 'the Riviera of the Middle East' after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere. 'The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too,' Trump told reporters. 'We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site.' Earlier in the day, Trump referred to Gaza as a 'demolition site' and said its residents have 'no alternative' but to leave, suggesting Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab states as possible relocation sites. Trump performed remarkably well with Arab American voters in the 2024 presidential election. In the majority-Arab American city of Dearborn, Michigan, 42 percent of voters backed Trump, compared to 36 percent who supported Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Other Arab American leaders and organizations slammed Trump’s proposal to vacate Palestinians from Gaza. Layla Elabed, the co-chair of the Uncommitted National Movement, said she was 'sad, angry, and scared for our communities.' James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, called Trump’s comments 'dangerous, provocative, illegal, and callously insensitive to Palestinian needs.' Wa’el Alzayat, leader of EmgageUSA, an organization that advocates on behalf of Muslim Americans, rebuffed Trump’s proposal as a 'violation of international law.'

White House expands search for countries to take in Gazans – repo...	Along with Egypt and Jordan, Trump administration is reportedly considering three other territories to take in Gazans part of the president's plan to rehabilitate the coastal enclave. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Trump administration is mulling a number of possible third-party countries and territories as possible hosts for Gazans migrating out of the Gaza Strip under President Donald Trump's proposed plan for the coastal enclave, an Israeli media outlet reported Wednesday evening. On Tuesday, Trump said his administration would promote the relocation en masse of the Strip's entire population to third-party countries, resettling Gazans outside of the warzone, while the U.S. takes control of the area for its rehabilitation and development into a 'Middle Eastern Riviera.' Trump revealed last month that he has spoken with the leaders of Egypt and Jordan regarding the possibility of the two moderate Arab states taking in Gazans - a request both countries publicly rejected. Subsequent reports have claimed that the White House is also considering Indonesia and Albania as host countries. On Wednesday, Channel 12 News reported that the White House is now weighing working with Morocco and two territories inside of Somalia to resettle Gazans. The territories include Puntland, an autonomous zone on the northeastern edge of Somalia, and Somaliland, a self-declared state which has claimed independence from Somalia. Combined, the two areas have a total population of roughly 10.5 million. According to the report, the U.S. believes that Morocco and the two territories may be willing to work with the U.S. in exchange for American support, including backing for their claims in long-running territorial disputes. Morocco has been engaged in a long-running conflict with a separatist group in the Western Sahara. While Rabat maintains effective control over most of the Western Sahara, most countries refuse to recognize its sovereignty over the area. The first Trump administration granted American recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the area in exchange for Rabat's normalizing of relations with Israel in 2020. Morocco still is seeking support in securing the recognition of other foreign powers, however. Somaliland has long claimed independence from Somalia and sought international recognition, while Puntland last year claimed it was no longer under the authority of the federal Somali government.

IDF ordered to facilitate mass migration of Gazans	Israel's defense chief directs the military to draft plan enabling Gazans to leave the Gaza Strip en masse, following President Donald Trump's call for the relocation of the entire population of the coastal enclave. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Israeli military is preparing to help facilitate the mass migration of Palestinian Arabs out of the Gaza Strip, Israel's defense chief revealed Thursday. According to a statement released by Defense Minister Israel Katz's (Likud) office Thursday morning, the minister has instructed the IDF to aid Gazans wishing to leave the Strip to do so. In the statement, Katz lauded President Donald Trump's announcement Tuesday of his plans to relocate en masse the Gaza Strip's entire population to third-party countries. Trump's proposal, Katz said, is a 'courageous plan which could enable a wide swath of the population in Gaza to leave to various places around the world.' 'Hamas used Gaza residents as human shields and built terror infrastructure in the heart of the population, and is now holding them hostage, extorting money from them by use of humanitarian aid, and preventing them from leaving Gaza.' The defense minister's orders do not include any steps to force or encourage Gazans to emigrate, but merely to ensure IDF cooperation enabling those who express a desire to leave to do so. The measures would include ensuring the emigrants passage through land crossings or, in special cases, arrangement of passage by sea or air, presumably via Israel. 'Gaza’s residents should be allowed the freedom to exit and emigrate, as is the practice anywhere around the world,' Katz said. Taking aim at countries which have endorsed unilateral Palestinian statehood and backed 'false accusations' against Israel's conduct in the Gaza Strip, Katz suggested Spain, Ireland, and Norway take in Gazans. Katz also noted that Canada has 'previously voiced a willingness to absorb Gaza residents.'

Defense Secretary: US will help Israel ‘eradicate radical enemies...	Netanyahu praised Trump's 'peace through strength' doctrine, saying that Israel shares the same perspective on maintaining a powerful military in order to ensure reginal stability. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth met at the Pentagon on Wednesday, with the two men stressing the importance of military cooperation between Israel and the United States. 'We're honored to stand alongside you and stare down many of the same threats that you do, and under President Trump's leadership, just like you, we are totally committed to achieving peace through strength,' Hegseth told Netanyahu, according to a summary of the meeting published by the Department of Defense. 'We are going to continue to grow our defense industrial base,' Hegseth continued, adding that he had been to Israel numerous times and understands the threats facing the Jewish State. The secretary of defense referenced previous weapons shipments that were delayed by the Biden administration, pledging that Washington would now provide Israel with advanced arms needed for a decisive victory over its enemies. Some of those munitions include 2,000 pound bombs, which Israel had paid for but were not delivered during Biden's tenure. 'We've supplied munitions that were previously not supplied [and] that are useful in eradicating radical enemies, and we are committed to continuing to do so,' Hegseth said. 'Destroying Hamas's capabilities in Gaza, Hezbollah's capabilities in the north, damaging the Houthi infrastructure in Yemen and things that are of great importance to America,' he added. Netanyahu praised Trump's 'peace through strength' doctrine, saying that Israel shares the same perspective on maintaining a powerful military in order to ensure reginal stability. 'The only way to get peace, and enduring peace, is by being very, very strong,' he said. 'And with our alliance and your support, including the decision … of supplying Israel the much-needed tools for our defense, we are a lot stronger than we've ever been.'

3 arrested for waving Hamas flags, celebrating released terrorist...	During the celebrations for released security prisoners, the trio waved Hamas flags and praised the terror group. By World Israel News Staff Three people were arrested for publicly supporting terror during celebrations marking the release of security prisoners, Israeli security forces said in a statement on Wednesday. The suspects, who were not named in the media release, are residents of Palestinian Authority-controlled enclaves in Judea and Samaria. They reportedly participated in welcoming home convicted terrorists who were freed to the Ramallah area during the ongoing ceasefire and hostage deal. During the celebrations, the trio waved Hamas flags, praised the terror group, and engaged in other activity 'disruptive to public order,' which is against Israeli law. 'The determined, intelligent, and professional operations of our security forces conveyed a clear message - celebrating the release of terrorists will not happen on our watch,' said Border Police Commander Maj. Itzhak Brik in a press statement. 'We will not allow any attempts to disrupt public order. We will continue to monitor the released terrorists, who must know that any of them who return to terrorism will be met with the full force of the State of Israel's security forces.' Last week, footage of a senior terrorist being released to an eastern Jerusalem neighborhood while clad in a Hamas scarf sparked widespread outrage. Ashraf Zagheir, who was serving a life sentence for his involvement in a Tel Aviv bus bombing, was freed from an Israeli prison in late January. He was welcomed home to the Kfar Aqab neighborhood with a procession promoting the Hamas terror group, as participants waved Hamas flags and fired into the air. At the time, police said that the 'terms of the hostage release deal' prevented them from being able to re-arrest Zagheir on charges of promoting terror. It's unclear if the suspects arrested by the police on Wednesday included those who had participated in celebrations marking Zagheir's release.

Attacked IDF post operated ‘like Oct. 7th didn’t happen’ – Report	The terrorist managed to ascend the observation tower at the compound, killing a soldier inside the pillbox and another on the ground. By World Israel News Staff The army post in northern Samaria that was the scene of a recent deadly terror attack had operated according to lax security standards, according to a report from Hebrew-language outlet KAN News. Two IDF reservists were killed and eight others were wounded when a terrorist infiltrated a military compound and observation tower next to the Tayasir checkpoint on Tuesday. The terrorist, armed with an M-16 automatic assault rifle and clad in a bulletproof vest, reportedly scouted out the site days in advance of the attack. He then snuck into the compound under the cover of darkness in the early hours of Tuesday morning, then attacked at around 6:00 am. There were 12 soldiers present in the compound at the time of the attack, with two shot fatally and another eight sustaining wounds from gunfire. The terrorist managed to ascend the observation tower at the site, killing a soldier inside the pillbox and another on the ground. The troops at the Tayasir outpost engaged in a minutes-long firefight with the terrorist, but failed to neutralize him. A soldier from a back-up squad eventually hurled a grenade at the terrorist, finally killing the assailant and ending the attack. The perpetrator was later identified as Mohammad Daraghmeh. His brother, Ahmad Daraghmeh, was the commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s Tubas Battalion and was killed by Israeli security forces in February 2024. The army has pledged to 'learn lessons' from the deadly attack, referring to it as a 'difficult incident.' The attack demonstrated a major security failure on the part of the IDF, with many questioning how the terrorist was able to access the compound so easily. 'The lessons haven't been learned, unfortunately, as if October 7 never happened,' a security source told KAN News. Maj. Ofer Yung and Maj. Avraham Tzvi (Tzvika) Friedman were killed in the attack. Yung leaves behind a wife and two children, and Friedman is survived by his wife and six children.

An EU spokesperson reaffirmed the commitment to two-state solution as a resolution to the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The European Union has firmly rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for post-war Gaza, emphasizing that it views Gaza as an integral part of a future Palestinian state. An EU spokesperson reaffirmed its commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state as a resolution to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The EU’s statement was a response to Trump’s announcement at a press conference on Tuesday, attended by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During the event, Trump declared that the U.S. would permanently relocate the entire population of the Gaza Strip to other countries, assume control of the territory, and redevelop it into a luxury coastal destination akin to a Middle Eastern 'Riviera.' Several high-profile Israeli lawmakers, from both the Coalition and the Opposition, praised Trump’s plan. Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana (Likud) described it as the 'dawn of a new day.' 'This is what happens when two brave leaders meet,' said Transportation Minister Miri Regev, also of the ruling Likud party. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar (New Hope) expressed optimism about the proposal, saying it was important to 'consider out-of-the-box ideas.' 'Gaza in its previous form has no future. Another solution must be found – and that’s what President Trump is trying to do,' said Sa’ar. A number of European governments, including Germany, France, Britain, and Spain, voiced strong opposition to Trump’s plan. 'The displacement of the Palestinian civilian population from Gaza would not only be unacceptable and a violation of international law,' said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, 'but it would also lead to new suffering and new hatred.' British Foreign Minister David Lammy reiterated London’s support for a two-state solution. 'We must see Palestinians live and prosper in their homelands in Gaza and the West Bank.' France’s foreign ministry echoed Lammy’s remarks, stating that Paris will 'continue to advocate for the implementation of the two-state solution, the only framework that can ensure lasting peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians.'

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Iran’s Foreign Minister responded to Trump’s 'maximum pressure' policy on Tuesday, predicting it would fail but suggesting that an agreement with the U.S. could be possible if the issue was limited to preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. 'Maximum pressure is a failed experiment, and trying it again will only lead to another failure,' said Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. He added, 'If the primary concern is preventing Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons, this can be achieved without difficulty.' Araghchi did not address Trump’s threat of sanctions on Iranian oil exports. A U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday that Trump plans to sign an executive order reinstating a 'maximum pressure' campaign against the Islamic Republic of Iran. The order seeks to block all avenues for the Iranian regime to obtain nuclear weapons while countering Tehran’s harmful regional influence, the official stated. It directs U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to apply maximum economic pressure through sanctions and enforcement measures against those who violate existing restrictions. Once Trump signs the order, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will collaborate with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to amend or revoke existing sanctions waivers, aiming to reduce the Islamic regime’s oil exports to zero, the official said. On Wednesday, Trump took to social media to emphasize that his 'maximum pressure' campaign was not intended to destroy Iran’s infrastructure but rather to take steps toward achieving a nuclear peace treaty. 'I want Iran to be a great and successful Country, but one that cannot have a Nuclear Weapon. Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens,' ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED,' Trump wrote. 'I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper. We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed. God Bless the Middle East!'

Sister of Israeli hostage in Iraq says Biden Administration ‘kept...	Emma Tsurkov to Trump: 'Thank God a tough leader with a backbone of steel is in the White House and has stopped playing games. Mr. President, only you can bring my sister home!' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Emma Tsurkov, the sister of hostage Elizabeth Tsurkov, criticized the Biden administration and corrupt Iraqi officials for the lack of progress in securing her sister’s release. 'It's been 687 days since my sister Elizabeth, a Princeton student, was kidnapped in Baghdad—687 days of incompetence and inaction by the Iraqi prime minister,' Tsurkov wrote. 'The Biden administration has kept showering corrupt Iraqi officials with hundreds of millions of our taxpayer dollars without accountability. Thank God a tough leader with a backbone of steel is in the White House and has stopped playing games. Mr. President, only you can bring my sister home!' she added. Elizabeth Tsurkov, a researcher specializing in the Middle East at Princeton University, traveled to Iraq on her Russian passport to conduct research for her doctoral dissertation. However, Israeli citizens are prohibited from traveling to enemy nations, even with a foreign passport, due to security concerns. She has been held hostage by a Shia militia in Iraq since 2023. Tsurkov’s family said they spoke with her the day before she was captured and that nothing seemed unusual. 'We talked the day before the kidnapping—a completely normal and standard conversation about the interviews she had done and what was left for her to complete,' they said. Last week, the British website Amwaj reported that, in exchange for Tsurkov, Israel would release eight Hezbollah terrorists captured since the beginning of the conflict with Lebanon. One of the terrorists slated for release is Imad Ahmaz, a senior member of Hezbollah’s naval force, who was captured three months earlier in a special operation by Shayetet 13. Last week, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein told Axios that Tsurkov is still alive after two years in captivity and that Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani is working toward her release. In a September 2023 interview, the Iraqi prime minister said it was unclear who was responsible for abducting Tsurkov. 'The incident damages the reputation of Iraq’s stability and the capabilities of our security agencies,' he said.

Favorite son? New Yorkers like Trump more than Dem governor, poll...	She also holds a negative 44-48 percent job approval rating, with only 22 percent saying that Hochul's administration has improved New York's fiscal condition. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Residents of deep-blue New York view President Donald Trump more favorably than Democratic governor Kathy Hochul, who struggles with low approval ratings and bleak reelection prospects, according to a poll released Monday. Trump's favorability in the Empire State has risen to 41 percent, up from 37 percent in December, while just 39 percent of New York voters rate Hochul favorably, according to the Siena College poll. The poll found that only 31 percent of New Yorkers would vote to reelect Hochul, with 57 percent saying they would vote for 'someone else.' Hochul has faced widespread criticism in recent months for her mixed messages on congestion pricing, which was slated to go into effect in June 2024 until she unexpectedly blocked it. She started the program last month, charging drivers $9 to enter Midtown Manhattan. The governor, who is eyeing a reelection bid next year, has not received a positive favorability rating among New York voters in the survey since January 2024. She also holds a negative 44-48 percent job approval rating, with only 22 percent saying that Hochul's administration has improved New York's fiscal condition. Trump was a lifelong New Yorker until he made his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida his primary residence in 2019. 'Governor Hochul's favorability and job approval ratings continue to languish in negative territory,' Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said, noting that 41 percent of Democrats prefer another candidate as their next governor. Trump's job approval rating stands at 46-51 percent, according to the Monday poll. The president lost New York by 12.6 percentage points in the 2024 election, down from 23.1 points in 2020 and 22.6 points in 2016. The post Favorite son?

Discovery of 2,500-year-old Negev burial site sheds light on anci...	Additionally, an amulet depicting the Egyptian god Bes was found among the burial items, and Bes was often associated with the protection of women and children, suggesting that many of the deceased may have been women. By Pesach Benson, TPS Archaeologists uncovered a 2,500-year-old burial site in the Negev Highlands, shedding light on ancient trade routes that connected cultures from Yemen, Phoenicia, Egypt, and beyond, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced on Wednesday. The site, south of Beer-Sheva, contains dozens of tombs believed to belong to individuals from caravans that passed through the region, highlights the Negev’s role as an international crossroads during the 7th to 5th centuries BCE. Archaeologists found copper and silver jewelry, alabaster items used for incense preparation, amulets, beads, and vessels likely used to transport incense resins. 'The discovery is unique and it points to wide-reaching cultural interchange between southern and northern Arabia, Phoenicia, Egypt and southern Europe,' said excavation director Dr. Martin David Pasternak. They also found arrowheads made of flint, a material associated with ancient trade from Yemen and Oman, with traces of ochre. 'The presence of ochre on these arrowheads may indicate their religious or cultic significance as having special value,' explained Dr. Jacob Vardi, an Antiquities Authority specialist in flint tools. The tombs raise intriguing questions about their purpose and the nature of the trade caravans that used the route. Pasternak said the tombs could have served as a long-term burial site for caravans passing through the area, or they may mark the mass burial of a caravan that came under attack. Despite their location at a remote junction in the desert, the site’s strategic position along key trade routes makes it a plausible resting place for travelers engaged in long and perilous journeys across difficult terrain. These traders were likely involved in the transport of valuable goods such as frankincense and myrrh, prized commodities from southern Arabia. The findings also suggest a more complex social dynamic among the caravans. Dr. Tali Erickson-Gini, a senior researcher, pointed to the presence of artifacts that may indicate the involvement of women in these trade networks. Texts from the period describe the purchase of women as part of the caravan trade, and an inscription found in Yemen records the purchase of 30 women from Gaza. Additionally, an amulet depicting the Egyptian god Bes was found among the burial items. Bes was often associated with the protection of women and children, suggesting that many of the deceased may have been women. This raises the possibility that the caravans could have been involved in human trafficking, a practice documented in ancient texts. 'The discovery emphasizes the central role of the Negev in antiquity as an international crossroad and as a gateway for trade and a meeting place of cultures,' said Antiquities Authority director Eli Escusido. 'The discovery is unique and it enables us to touch small but important historical moments of the people who traversed the desert through this place centuries ago.'

‘Slidetronics’: Breakthrough in atomic layer manipulation could t...	These new configurations, once formed, remain stable even after the external force is removed and can store information, functioning much like a tiny memory unit. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli researchers revealed an atomic innovation that could pave the way for faster, more efficient memory storage, advanced semiconductors, and even quantum computing technologies, offering a level of precision and control never before seen in material science. In a Tel Aviv University study released on Wednesday, researchers shared a new method of manipulating the atomic layers of materials such as graphite to create new configurations with unique properties. 'Slidetronics,' as the researchers call it, works by sliding the layers of materials that are held together by weak van der Waals forces, such as graphite, into different stable positions. Van der Waals forces are weak, short-range forces that occur between atoms or molecules. Unlike chemical bonds, which involve the sharing or transfer of electrons, van der Waals forces are a result of temporary shifts in the distribution of electrons around atoms or molecules. The scientists, led by Prof. Ben Shalom and PhD students Maayan Vizner Stern and Simon Salleh Atri, achieved the slidetronic shifts by applying small forces like electric fields or mechanical pressure, which caused the atomic layers to slide into new configurations. These new configurations, once formed, remain stable even after the external force was removed. The result is a material that can store information, functioning much like a tiny memory unit. The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed Nature Review Physics. The researchers said that the ability to control these atomic-level structural changes opens up new possibilities for manipulating material properties on demand. 'Like graphite, nature produces many other materials with weakly bonded layers. Each layer behaves like a LEGO brick—breaking a single brick is difficult, but separating and reconnecting two bricks is relatively simple,' said Stern. 'Similarly, in layered materials, the layers prefer specific stacking positions where atoms align perfectly with those in the neighboring layer. Sliding between these positions happens in tiny, discrete jumps—just an atomic distance at a time.' The researchers also explored how different numbers of layers influence material properties. For example, three layers of a material with two types of atoms can create six distinct stable materials, each with unique internal polarizations. With five layers, this number increases to 45 different possible structures. By switching between these configurations, scientists can control electrical, magnetic, and optical properties. Even graphite, composed solely of carbon, can rearrange into six different crystalline forms, each with distinct electrical conductivities, infrared responses, magnetizations, and superconducting properties, the researchers noted. The potential applications are vast. First and foremost, Slidetronics could revolutionize memory storage. By utilizing the ability to shift atomic layers into distinct arrangements, researchers can create ultra-small memory units that are faster, more efficient, and have higher storage capacities than existing technologies. These tiny memory units could outperform traditional memory storage devices, offering enhanced speed and lower energy consumption. Additionally, the precise control over atomic layers could lead to the development of advanced semiconductors with customizable electrical properties. The ability to manipulate materials at the atomic level also holds promise for quantum computing. By controlling the electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of materials, Slidetronics could help develop more efficient qubits—quantum bits that are central to quantum computers, leading to faster and more powerful quantum systems. Other practical applications include the creation of new superconducting materials or those with specialized magnetic properties, useful in fields like medical imaging, energy transmission, and particle physics. The precise manipulation of materials could also enable the development of customizable smart materials that adapt to changing conditions, with applications in robotics, aerospace, and medicine.

Trump dismisses Iran attack reports, calls for nuclear peace agre...	Trump intends to sign an executive order resuming a 'maximum pressure' campaign on the Islamic Republic of Iran, a U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday. By JNS Iran should be a successful country but it must not acquire nuclear weapons, U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday. Dismissing reports that the U.S. and Israel plan to destroy Iranian nuclear infrastructure as 'greatly exaggerated,' he instead advocated for a verified nuclear peace agreement. He called for immediate efforts to negotiate such a deal. 'I want Iran to be a great and successful Country, but one that cannot have a Nuclear Weapon. Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens,' ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED,' Trump wrote. 'I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper. We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed. God Bless the Middle East!' Trump intends to sign an executive order resuming a 'maximum pressure' campaign on the Islamic Republic of Iran, a U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday. The order is aimed at denying the Iranian regime all paths to nuclear weapons and countering Tehran’s malign regional influence, the official stated. The order directs U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to impose maximum economic pressure, including via sanctions and enforcement mechanisms on those violating existing measures. After Trump signs the order, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will work with Bessent to modify or rescind existing sanction waivers to drive the Islamic regime’s oil exports to zero, the official said. Iran is seeking to quickly build a crude nuclear device, with the aim of deterring a Western attack, The New York Times reported on Monday, citing U.S. officials. The assessment is based on intelligence collected during the final months of the Biden administration and passed on to Trump’s national security team during the transition, the officials said. Iran has the knowledge to make an 'older-style nuclear weapon, one that could be put together far faster than the more sophisticated designs Tehran has considered in the past,' the Times reported. Iran likely obtained the weapon’s blueprints from Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan (1936-2021), according to the report. Although such a weapon would not fit on a ballistic missile and would be less reliable than more modern ones, it could be built faster and would serve as a deterrent against attack.

Trump’s Gaza plan draws praise, condemnations, and outrage	Israeli leaders and Republicans laud Trump for 'bold new plan' to resettle Gazans, while European foreign ministers reject the plan, and Palestinian leaders and far-left Democrats accuse Trump of planning 'ethnic cleansing.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Reactions around the world to President Donald Trump's plan for the Gaza Strip, unveiled at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Tuesday, ranged from full-throated praise to accusations of ethnic cleansing. During Tuesday's press conference, Trump announced that his administration is seeking to 'permanently' resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip in third-party countries, with the U.S. taking control of the coastal enclave and rebuilding it as a Middle Eastern 'Riviera.' A number of prominent Israeli lawmakers, both from the Coalition and the Opposition, lauded Trump's plan, with Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana (Likud) calling it the 'dawn of a new day.' 'This is what happens when two brave leaders meet,' said Transportation Minister Miri Regev, also of the ruling Likud party. MK Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit), a former National Security Minister who bolted the government last month over the Gaza ceasefire deal, called the plan the 'beginning of a beautiful friendship.' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar (New Hope) expressed optimism regarding the plan, saying it was important to 'consider out-of-the-box ideas.' 'Gaza in its previous form has no future. Another solution must be found – and that’s what President Trump is trying to do.' Opposition MK and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz said the plan demonstrated that Trump 'is a true friend of Israel and will continue to stand by it on issues important to strengthening its security.' In a statement, Gantz called Trump's idea 'creative, original and interesting.' 'In his remarks, he presented creative, original and interesting thinking, which must be examined alongside the realization of the goals of the war, giving priority to the return of all the hostages.' Israeli Opposition Leader Yair Lapid (Yesh Atid) declined to either praise or criticize the proposal, saying he would need time to 'study the details.' 'We will have to study the details to understand what the plan is in Gaza,' Lapid told Galei Tzahal radio on Wednesday. A far-left Knesset Member, Ofer Cassif, the token Jewish member of the Arab Hadash-Ta'al list, excoriated Trump's plan, threatening to 'blow up the bridges' to block the 'transfer' of Gaza's population. 'Facing the notion of ​​Arab deportation and exile — ‘transfer’ — we must stand up and say sharply and simply: It will be impossible because we will not allow it,' Cassif tweeted. 'Even if we have to lie down under the wheels of trucks. Even if we have to blow up the bridges. There will be no mass deportation by force, because we will not allow it to happen.' Cassif is already suspended from the Knesset after he praised Palestinian terrorists and joined a petition to the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in the Gaza Strip. The Chinese Foreign Ministry panned the Gaza plan, with spokesman Lin Jian dubbing it a 'forced transfer.' 'China has always maintained that Palestinian rule over Palestinians is the basic principle of the postwar governance of Gaza, and we are opposed to the forced transfer of the residents of Gaza.' Multiple European governments joined in voicing their objections to Trump's plan, including Germany, France, Britain, and Spain. 'A displacement of the Palestinian civilian population from Gaza would not just be unacceptable and against international law,' said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. 'This would also lead to new suffering and new hatred.' British Foreign Minister David Lammy said London still backs a two-state solution. 'We must see Palestinians live and prosper in their homelands in Gaza and the West Bank.' France's foreign ministry echoed Lammy's comments, saying Paris will 'continue to campaign for the implementation of the two-state solution, the only one that can guarantee long-term peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike.' Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told reporters his government rejected Trump's plan. 'I want to be very clear on this: Gaza is the land of Gazan Palestinians and they must stay in Gaza.' Among the Palestinian leadership, both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority were unequivocal in their condemnation of the relocation plan. Hamas denounced Trump's proposal as a 'recipe for generating chaos and tension,' while PA chief Mahmoud Abbas said the plan was 'not negotiable.' 'President Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian leadership expressed their strong rejection of calls to seize the Gaza Strip and displace Palestinians outside their homeland,' his office said. At home, multiple Republican lawmakers responded positively to Trump's plan, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who hailed the proposal as a 'bold action in hopes of achieving lasting peace in Gaza.' 'We are hopeful this brings much needed stability and security to the region,' Johnson tweeted. 'Hamas terrorists murdered babies and burned people alive,' said Florida Senator Rick Scott. 'They are evil monsters. Thank God we finally have a president who is committed to standing with Israel and working with Netanyahu on how to support their efforts to get terrorists out of Gaza and bring every hostage home.' Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman praised the Gaza plan as 'brilliant, historic.' 'Trump’s proposed USA takeover of the Gaza Strip may sound out of the box, but it is brilliant, historic and the only idea I have heard in 50 years that has a chance of bringing security, peace and prosperity to this troubled region.' Under President Trump, America will be the beacon of PEACE for the world! It’s time to change the Middle East in pursuit of ending endless war, and this is EXACTLY how it’s done,' said Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. On the Left, Michigan Democrat Rep. Rashida Tlaib excoriated both Trump and Netanyahu, calling the latter a 'genocidal war criminal,' while accusing the president of pursuing 'ethnic cleansing.' 'This president is openly calling for ethnic cleansing while sitting next to a genocidal war criminal,' Tlaib tweeted. 'He’s perfectly fine cutting off working Americans from federal funds while the funding to the Israeli government continues flowing.' 'Palestinians aren’t going anywhere. This president can only spew this fanatical bullshit because of bipartisan support in Congress for funding genocide and ethnic cleansing. It's time for my two-state solution colleagues to speak up.'

Jewish population of Judea & Samaria to top 1 million by 2050	Number of Israelis living in Judea and Samaria rises to 530,000, not including 340,000 Israelis living in parts of Jerusalem liberated in 1967, report says. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The number of Israelis living in Judea and Samaria topped 530,000 in 2025, with the settler population slated to exceed one million by 2050, according to a new report published Wednesday morning. The report, drafted by the Bet El Institutions and former MK Yaakov Katz, and based on data collected by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, found that as of New Year's Eve, the number of residents registered in the 125 Israeli towns in Judea and Samaria stood at 529,455, and is now projected to be nearing 540,000. The growth rate of Judea and Samaria's Israeli population continues to exceed that of Israel as a whole by more than twofold, with the area growing 2.33% during 2024, compared to 1.1% for Israel as a whole. The statistics do not include the roughly 340,000 people living in Israeli neighborhoods in Jerusalem in areas liberated during the 1967 war. With the population of east Jerusalem included, roughly 880,000 Israelis now live in areas liberated from Jordan in the Six Day War. If the growth rate observed in Judea and Samaria over the past five years continues, the number of Israelis living in the area will reach close to 605,000 in five years, nearly 700,000 by 2035, and will top 1,030,000 by 2050. The two largest settlements are both ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) cities, with Modi'in Illit, in Samaria, topping the list with 90,633 residents, followed by Beitar Illit in Judea, with 73,198 residents. Maale Adumim, east of Jerusalem, came in a distant third with 40,606 residents, followed by Givat Ze'ev with 24,654 and Ariel rounding out the top five with 21,711. The Jordan Valley was the district within Judea and Samaria which enjoyed the most significant growth during 2024, expanding by 4.2% last year and by 25.5% during the last five years.

Stockholm cracks down on mosque serving as Iranian spy ring	Swedish authorities escalated their investigation last month with a late-night raid on Mohsen Hakimollahi’s Stockholm residence. By Jewish Breaking News Sweden has cracked down on what officials say is an Iranian intelligence operation hiding behind Stockholm’s largest Shiite mosque. Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed revealed on Monday that the Imam Ali Islamic Center (IAC) has been under investigation for serving as a platform for Iranian intelligence operations targeting both Swedish interests and the Iranian diaspora community. 'This is extremely serious,' Forssmed told Expressen, adding that Sweden had stopped all state monetary aid to the center. He also said that 'additional measures' were being pursued but did not provide further information. Swedish authorities escalated their investigation last month with a late-night raid on Mohsen Hakimollahi’s Stockholm residence. The 63-year-old Imam, sent by Tehran in 2011 to run the center, had held permanent residency since 2017. He was arrested and issued a deportation order last Thursday. Predictably, the mosque maintains its innocence. 'IAC maintains strict oversight to ensure that our premises are not used as a platform for any criminal activity,' IAC states on its website. 'The Centre aims, inter alia, to create a more friendly relationship and cooperation with various institutions, including government, to facilitate the integration of Muslims into Swedish society.' Iran has since summoned Sweden’s ambassador to protest. 'The Swedish ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Ministry yesterday, where we clearly expressed our concerns,' Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ismail Baghaei said as cited by state-run IRNA. 'Some decisions appear to be influenced by third parties who do not wish well for Iran-Sweden relations.' Sweden’s action follows similar measures across Europe, most notably Germany’s closure of the Hamburg Islamic Center in August over extremist activities linked to Iran. Authorities have not yet announced whether the mosaue will face closure following its terror director’s detention.

Netanyahu gifts Trump with golden pager	The prime minister called the president 'the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House' in their joint press conference. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented President Trump with gifts of a golden pager and a regular one during their meeting Tuesday, as tokens of one of Israel’s most spectacular anti-terror successes last year. The president understood immediately, saying, 'That was a great operation.' The Mossad had booby-trapped thousands of pagers that it managed to sell to Hezbollah through a third party, and when they were simultaneously detonated in September, about 30 Hezbollah operatives were killed and 3,000 were wounded. According to Mossad agents speaking to the American news show 60 Minutes two months later, 'It was the tipping point of the war' against the Lebanese terror group, which soon agreed to a ceasefire with Israel. For his part, Trump gave Netanyahu a picture of the two of them and, referring to the prime minister by his nickname, he wrote a dedication across its top, 'To Bibi, a great leader.' Netanyahu praised Trump fulsomely in their post-meeting, joint press conference, in which the president proposed that the U.S. take over Gaza in order to rebuild it and move the entire Palestinian population there to other countries for their own safety and to enable them to build better lives for themselves. Netanyahu first repeated Israel’s goals in Gaza, 'Destroy Hamas’s military and governing capabilities, secure the release of all our hostages and ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.' He then said to Trump, 'Your willingness to think outside the box with fresh ideas will help us to achieve these goals. And I’ve seen you do this many times. You cut to the chase, see things others refuse to see, say things others refuse to say, and after the jaws drop people scratch their heads and say, 'You know, he’s right.'' 'This is the kind of thinking that enabled us to bring the Abraham Accords, enable us to shape the Middle East and bring peace,' he added. He also thanked Trump for inviting him to be the first foreign leader to visit the White House in his second term, saying, 'This is a testament to your friendship and support for the Jewish state and the Jewish people.' 'I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again: You are the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House,' he continued. He ticked off a list of things Trump has already done for the Jewish state, including pressure that the president applied before entering office, which Netanyahu called 'leadership to help bring our hostages home, among them American citizens.' Referring to executive orders Trump has since signed, he said, 'You freed up munitions that have been withheld from Israel in the midst of a seven-front war for our existence. You ended unjust sanctions against law-abiding Israeli citizens, you boldly confronted the scourge of antisemitism, you stopped funding international organizations like UNRWA that support and fund terrorists, and today you renewed the maximum pressure campaign against Iran.' The latter was a reference to a directive to the U.S. Treasury to enforce sanctions in order to 'drive Iran’s oil exports to zero,' which would cripple the Islamic Republic’s economy that is almost completely dependent on its oil sales. 'Ladies and gentlemen,' Netanyahu said, 'all this in just two weeks, can we imagine where we’ll be in four years? I can, I know you can, Mr. President.'

Disabled ‘climate leaders’ in Asia, ‘indigenous language tech’ in...	Here's a rundown of USAID spending under President Joe Biden. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon As the Trump administration works to shrink the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and place it under the State Department's umbrella, congressional Democrats have argued that the move 'endangers lives and undermines U.S. national security.' But away from funding for lifesaving medicines like HIV drugs, funding that is exempt from the State Department's broader foreign aid freeze, USAID has spent millions in taxpayer cash on left-wing priorities like climate activism—and bankrolled groups linked to Palestinian terrorism. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Monday that he will serve as USAID’s acting leader while the Trump administration works to reduce the agency's spending. The agency's career staffers have battled the administration's 90-day freeze on foreign funding, seeking exemptions that would funnel tens of millions of dollars to agency bureaus that cover issues like 'environmental justice' and 'LGBTQI+ Inclusive Development,' the Washington Free Beacon reported. The Trump administration responded by putting scores of those staffers on administrative leave, a move Rubio said came in response to 'insubordination.' USAID 'has a history of … deciding that they're somehow a global charity separate from the national interest,' he told reporters on Monday. 'That sort of insubordination makes it impossible to conduct a sort of mature and serious review that I think foreign aid writ large should have.' Rubio said that the State Department will not gut foreign aid altogether, but rather cut 'programs that run counter to what we're trying to do in our national strategy.' Here's a rundown of spending under President Joe Biden that may fit that description: $1 Million To Make Disabled Tajikistanis 'Climate Leaders' In 2023, Biden’s USAID allocated up to $1 million in taxpayer funds on a project to help disabled people in Tajikistan become 'climate leaders,' the Free Beacon reported at the time. The grant notice solicited proposals for a 'Disability-Inclusive Climate Action' project in the Central Asian country. The cash was meant to ensure that disabled Tajikistanis were included 'in the development of climate change response and mitigation policies.' USAID championed the funding under its 2022-2030 climate strategy, a $150 billion 'whole-of-agency approach' that aimed to create an 'equitable world with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.' The Tajikistan grant was centered on ensuring 'that climate action by governments and other actors is informed by and responsive to the unique ideas and contributions of persons with disabilities.' $1 Million for Foreign DEI Programs, Including 'Indigenous Language Technology' in Guatemala Just before leaving office, the Biden administration pushed out more than $1 million in taxpayer-funded diversity, equity, and inclusion programs abroad, the Free Beacon reported. The funding notice, privately transmitted to Congress just before Christmas, said USAID would 'engage with Indigenous-led institutions to implement an Indigenous language technology program' in Guatemala, where nearly 95 percent of residents speak Spanish. In Kenya, meanwhile, USAID promised to 'build a collaborative bridge between U.S. higher education institutions, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities; select Kenyan universities; and the private sector.' And in Indonesia, the money aimed to help 'underrepresented' students 'gain access to higher education opportunities in the United States.' Nearly $100K to a Palestinian Activist Group Whose Leaders Hailed PFLP Terrorism In November 2022, USAID sent $78,000 to the Community Development and Continuing Education Institute (CDCEI), a Palestinian activist group based in Judea and Samaria. Its leaders praised a terrorist who murdered a U.S. military attaché as a 'hero fighter,' the Free Beacon reported. CDCEI got the cash to promote 'youth participation and accountability in local governance,' USAID said at the time. Imad Al-Zeer, the chair of CDCEI’s board, attended a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine event celebrating the 52nd anniversary of the terrorist group's founding. His deputy chair, Mike Salman, praised George Abdallah, a Lebanese terrorist serving a life sentence in France for the 1982 murder of U.S. military attaché Charles R. Ray, as 'the hero fighter George.' $1 Million to a Hamas-Linked Charity Just six days before Hamas's Oct. 7 assault on Israel, USAID doled out more than $900,000 'to a terror charity in Gaza involved with the son of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh,' a watchdog report obtained by the Free Beacon found. USAID earmarked the funds for the Bayader Association for Environment and Development, a Gaza-based humanitarian group that was said to be 'in close cooperation with [the] Hamas regime.' 'Bayader is listed in federal spending data as a sub-grantee for USAID, with the government monies first routed through a sponsoring U.S. nonprofit, which are ostensibly required to vet their sub-grantees,' according to a Middle East Forum report. USAID would not comment at the time on whether the money was subject to oversight or vetted to ensure it did not benefit Hamas. $1.5 Million Effort To 'Empower' Female Climate Activists in Northern Kenya In May 2023, USAID announced plans to spend $1.5 million on a program aimed at 'empowering' female climate activists in northern Kenya. The project, the Free Beacon reported at the time, centered on 'empowering women to adapt to climate change in northern Kenya.' Women in the area, USAID wrote, live in 'traditionally patriarchal communities' and need training to join Kenya’s fight against climate change. The funding notice detailed USAID’s efforts to 'empower women, improve their participation in decision making, and enhance adaptive capabilities to climate change.' The program also operated as part of USAID’s 2022-2030 climate strategy. $15 Million for 'Contraceptives and Condoms’ in Taliban-Controlled Afghanistan In July 2024, Biden's USAID sent $15 million into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan for the distribution of 'oral contraceptives and condoms.' The spending, outlined in a congressional funding notice obtained by the Free Beacon, came roughly three years after the administration's chaotic withdrawal from the country cemented the Taliban's resurgence. The notice acknowledged that 'some coordination' with the terror group would be 'necessary for programmatic purposes.' While U.S. law bars the federal government from funding the Taliban, the notice argued that USAID would work with 'national authorities' in Afghanistan without 'directly benefiting them.' A Well-Established Vetting Problem USAID has long struggled to ensure taxpayer cash goes to its intended use. A 2024 inspector general report, for example, found that the agency had issues combating 'corruption, abuse, and fraud.' 'One of USAID’s foremost challenges is ensuring U.S. taxpayer funds are used effectively, efficiently, and for their intended purposes,' the report said. 'However, corruption, fraud, and sexual exploitation and abuse undermine the effectiveness of aid, erode public trust, and impede sustainable development.' The agency also came under fire last year for failing to 'prevent the diversion of assistance to Hamas and other terrorist organizations,' according to the report. In one case, a Syrian national diverted $9 million in USAID funds to an affiliate of the al Qaeda terror group.

Israeli ex-minister mulls return to government after Trump’s spee...	Former National Security Minister drafts bill to encourage voluntary mass-migration of Gazans from the Gaza Strip, hints at possible return to the Netanyahu government after Trump proposes relocation of Gaza's population. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A former Israeli government minister, who bolted the coalition last month in protest of the ceasefire deal with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, hinted at the possible return of his party to the government, following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's joint press conference with President Donald Trump on Tuesday. MK Itamar Ben-Gvir, who until recently served as Israel's National Security Minister, said Wednesday that following Trump's comments a day earlier, it appears increasingly likely his Otzma Yehudit party will return to the Netanyahu government. 'I have yet to have a new minister's jacket prepared,' Ben-Gvir told Galey Yisrael Radio Wednesday morning, 'but there is no question that the chances of Otzma Yehudit rejoining the government have increased.' 'The ball is now in the prime minister's court,' Ben-Gvir continued. 'If he implements this, I'll be there with him all the way,' the lawmaker said, referring to Trump's proposal to relocate the entire population of the Gaza Strip. 'As soon as they start and there is a clear indication it will be implemented, I'm back in.' Ben-Gvir directly addressed Trump's plan in a series of tweets Tuesday night, writing in English: 'Donald, this looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' On Tuesday, Trump announced that his administration plans to facilitate the mass resettlement of Gaza's entire population in third-party countries, with the U.S. directly handling the post-war administration and rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip. The president added that the resettlement would be permanent. Earlier that day, Ben-Gvir and other members of his Otzma Yehudit faction submitted a bill which would offer financial incentives to Gazans to emigrate abroad. Any Gazan wishing to return after accepting the money offered under Ben-Gvir's plan would be required to pay back the grant in full, adjusted for inflation, or be barred from returning for life.

Israeli rabbinical courts report surge in divorces, but drop in s...	Among the regions showing the sharpest rise in divorce rates were Beit Shemesh and Kiryat Gat, both of which saw increases of 45% while Beitar Illit also experienced a 44% jump. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli rabbinical courts reported a notable 6.5% increase in divorces among Jewish Israelis in 2024, compared to the previous year, according to the Chief Rabbinate’s annual report released on Tuesday. The report also noted a drop in the number of recalcitrant husbands who were sanctioned by the court for refusing to divorce their wives. According to the report, a total of 11,542 divorces were finalized, up from 10,838 in 2023. The surge in divorce rates is attributed to the emotional strain caused by war with Hamas and Hezbollah. This increase marks the highest level of divorces since 2021, when the coronavirus pandemic and related lockdowns also contributed to a spike in marital separations. One key focus of the report was the work of a special rabbinical unit handling cases involving individuals who refuse to grant or accept a religious divorce, known as a get. In Jewish law, both the husband and wife must consent to the divorce, with the husband required to give his wife a get willingly, though significant pressure may be applied to compel him. A woman whose husband refuses to give a writ of divorce and cannot remarry is known as an agunah, or 'chained woman.' The divorce can also be invalid if the wife refuses to accept the get. According to the Rabbinate’s report, this unit secured 221 divorce documents in 2024 for women whose husbands had previously refused to grant them, a figure comparable to the 226 cases in 2023. The unit also imposed sanctions on 135 men who had refused to grant a get, down from 209 the previous year. Sanctions were also imposed on eight women who had refused to accept the divorce documents, up from six in 2023. As of early 2025, there are 67 open cases of ongoing get refusals, with 44 of those involving men and 23 involving women. In instances where a wife refuses to accept a get, there is a legal workaround that allows a man to remarry with the approval of 100 rabbis. According to the Rabbinate’s report, the procedure was used in seven cases during the Jewish year 5784 (2023-2024). Among the regions showing the sharpest rise in divorce rates were Beit Shemesh and Kiryat Gat, both of which saw increases of 45% while Beitar Illit also experienced a 44% jump. On the other hand, Jerusalem experienced a slight decline, with a 4% decrease in divorces. Religious affairs and issues of personal status such as marriage, divorce, and conversion are determined by leaders of Israel’s recognized religious communities — Jewish, Muslim, Druze and 10 Christian denominations. The rabbinate’s report only covered Jewish cases under its purview.

‘People like the idea’: Trump teases support for Israel’s annexat...	People do like the idea, but we haven't taken a position on it yet. But we will be making an announcement probably on that very specific topic over the next four weeks.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump hinted Tuesday that his administration will be deliberating in the coming weeks on an Israeli plan to apply sovereignty over large swaths of Judea and Samaria. Speaking at a joint press conference in the White House Tuesday afternoon with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump responded to questions from reporters regarding the premier's long-shelved plan to extend Israeli sovereignty over Israeli towns in Judea and Samaria. Netanyahu first announced the plan ahead of the September 2019 Knesset election, vowing to annex the Jordan Valley area, followed by the remaining Israeli towns in Judea and Samaria. In 2020, however, the proposal was shelved amid resistance from then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz and calls by the Trump administration to delay implementation of the plan in order to facilitate the signing of the Abraham Accords that year. On Tuesday, however, Trump teased a major announcement on the Israeli sovereignty plan, saying that while no decision had yet been made, the White House would be speaking out on it in roughly a month. 'Do you support Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, areas which many believe is the biblical homeland of the Jewish people?' Israel National News' Yoni Kempinski asked. 'We're discussing that with many of your representatives. You're represented very well,' Trump said. 'People do like the idea, but we haven't taken a position on it yet. But we will be making an announcement probably on that very specific topic over the next four weeks.' Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who served during the first Trump administration, said that in 2020, Israel agreed to drop its sovereignty plan for four years, until after the 2024 presidential election.
