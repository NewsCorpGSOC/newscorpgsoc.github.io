House passes annual defense bill with hundreds of millions for Is...	The bill also bars Tricare—the military’s health-care program—from paying for any medical procedure that could cause sterilization as part of the treatment of gender dysphoria in children, including sex-change operations. By JNS The U.S. House of Representatives passed the $895 billion annual defense bill on Wednesday with hundreds of millions of dollars for Israel. Formally titled the 'Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025,' the legislation includes $500 million for U.S.-Israel missile-defense cooperation, $47.5 million for U.S.-Israel cooperation on emerging technologies and $80 million for the U.S.-Israeli anti-tunneling initiative. It also includes a provision that would bar the U.S. Department of Defense from citing casualty statistics from the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. 'In making assessments of casualties and fatalities during hostilities, the Department of Defense may not cite as authoritative in public communications, fatality figures that are derived by United States-designated terrorist organizations, governmental entities controlled by United States-designated terrorist organizations, or any sources that rely on figures provided by United States-designated terrorist organizations,' the act says. The U.S. State Department designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. The Pentagon faced scrutiny regarding the use of Hamas’s statistics after Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin cited them during congressional testimony in February. They have been repeated by other members of the Biden administration, including U.S. President Joe Biden. In June, an Associated Press investigation revealed that Hamas’s claims about the number of Palestinian casualties were contradicted by its own data, and the United Nations nearly halved its casualty estimates back in May of the number of women and children killed in the conflict after more closely scrutinizing Hamas’s claims. Non-Israel provisions of the 1,813-page defense bill include an overall 1% increase in U.S. defense spending over fiscal year 2024 and a 14.5% pay increase for junior enlisted troops. The bill also bars Tricare—the military’s health-care program—from paying for any medical procedure that could cause sterilization as part of the treatment of gender dysphoria in children, including sex-change operations. The defense spending package passed 281-140, with 81 Democrats supporting the bill and 16 Republicans opposing. The vote split the Democratic leadership, with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), Democratic Caucus chairman Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) and Democratic Caucus vice chair Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) voting 'yea' while Democratic Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), assistant Democratic leader Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) joined most Democrats in voting 'nay.' The 16 Republicans who voted against the bill included some of the House’s most conservative members, including former Freedom Caucus chairmen Reps. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and Bob Good (R-Va.). The bill will now proceed to the Senate.

Israel will retain control of Syrian buffer zone until new force ...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defends IDF seizure of demilitarized zone on Syrian side of the Golan Heights, says Israel's military must remain there to prevent jihadi infiltration until a new 'force' can secure the area. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday defended Israel's seizure of a demilitarized zone on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, saying the move was necessary to prevent new 'October 7th style attacks' on Israel. In a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office Thursday morning, Netanyahu warned that the fall of the Assad regime on Sunday left a 'vacuum' on Israel's northern border, one which could potentially be exploited by Islamist elements operating in Syria. 'The collapse of the Syrian regime created a vacuum on Israel’s border and in the buffer zone established by the 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement,' Netanyahu said. 'Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7th style attacks.' 'That is why Israeli forces entered the buffer zone and took control of strategic sites near Israel’s border.' Netanyahu emphasized that Israel's control of the demilitarized zone is temporary, and will end when a new force can secure the area, though the Israeli premier declined to specify who would be responsible for the new force, or when such a force could be assembled. 'This deployment is temporary until a force that is committed to the 1974 agreement can be established and security on our border can be guaranteed.' The Golan Heights demilitarized zone was established following the 1973 Yom Kippur War, during which Syrian forces overran much of the Golan during the initial invasion, before IDF troops retook the strategic plateau and drove into the interior of Syria towards Damascus. To disengage the entangled Israeli and Syrian forces, the U.S. negotiated the May 1974 Disengagement of Forces agreement, under which Israel ceded 200 square miles of the 700 square-mile Golan. Nearly half of the area handed over to Syria became a demilitarized zone, with a United Nations observer force to ensure compliance with the ceasefire. On Sunday, shortly after the collapse of the Assad regime, Israeli tanks and infantry units occupied the DMZ, establishing a new security zone.

IDF intercepts Houthi and Iraqi drone over southern Israel	On Monday, a blast in a residential high-rise building in Yavne, northeast of Ashdod, was confirmed to have been caused by a drone launched from Yemen. By World Israel News and JNS The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported multiple incidents involving drones launched toward Israel from various locations. On Thursday, the IDF intercepted a drone launched by Houthi terrorists from Yemen over the Red Sea. The drone, which was targeting Israel’s southernmost city of Eilat, did not cross into Israeli airspace, according to the military. Earlier that day, air-raid sirens were triggered in several cities near the Gaza Strip, including Ashkelon, Sderot, and Netivot, following reports of a suspected drone. However, the IDF later stated that the incident was under investigation and might have been a false alarm. In another development, the Israeli Air Force intercepted an attack drone launched 'from the east' into southern Israel. The term 'from the east' is commonly used to indicate an attack originating from Iraq. This drone did not trigger alarms per standard protocol, and no injuries were reported. These incidents follow a series of drone attacks targeting Israel in recent weeks. On Monday, a blast in a residential high-rise building in Yavne, northeast of Ashdod, was confirmed to have been caused by a drone launched from Yemen. On November 17, another drone intercepted over central Israel entered Israeli airspace from the east. The interception led to an impact near Moshav Kfar Hanagid, close to Yavne, where a fire, apparently caused by an interceptor fragment, was subsequently extinguished. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iranian-backed Shi’ite militias, has been conducting daily drone attacks on Israel since the Hamas-led massacre in southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Similarly, Iran-backed Houthi forces in Yemen have launched numerous drones and missiles targeting Israel over the past year, aligning with their support for the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza.

Tel Aviv defense-tech summit highlights innovation, AI	Innovation and the transformative role of artificial intelligence in defense was a recurring theme at the conference, spearheaded by the Israel Ministry of Defense Directorate of Defense, Research, and Development (DDR&D). By Sveta Listratov, TPS As Israeli airstrikes systematically dismantled Syrian military assets, leading figures in defense innovation, entrepreneurship, and academia gathered at Tel Aviv University some 200 km away to discuss the impact of technology on the battlefront. 'We all watched as Syria collapsed within days. The entire Iranian Axis was severely damaged as a direct result of Israel’s military operations. When Israeli pilots used American aircraft equipped with Israeli technology to hit Iran’s most advanced defense systems – it sent a powerful message to the world,' said Eyal Zamir, Director General of the Defense Ministry, speaking at the International Defense Tech Summit at Tel Aviv University on Tuesday. 'Artificial intelligence (AI) is not just another technological revolution; it will completely redefine warfare as we know it. A country that does not invest in AI today will fall far behind on tomorrow’s battlefield.' Zamir also called for expanding manufacturing independence in Israel’s defense industry to reduce reliance on foreign resources. Innovation and the transformative role of artificial intelligence in defense was a recurring theme at the conference, spearheaded by the Israel Ministry of Defense Directorate of Defense, Research, and Development (DDR&D). 'Innovation is not just our secret weapon but our source of strength,' said Avi Hason, CEO of Startup Nation Central, in his keynote speech. 'The ability of Israeli companies to deliver, even during crises, continues to position Israel as a leading hub for innovation.' Hason noted that high-tech accounts for 20% of Israel’s GDP and half of its exports. But despite more than a year of war, Israeli high-tech has demonstrated resilience, raising over $10 billion in venture investments in 2024 alone. Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital, shared an optimistic outlook on the country’s technological trajectory. 'Israel’s leadership in dual-use technologies — blending civilian and military applications– is unparalleled,' said Maguire. 'The rise of defense-tech is redefining the startup world, turning once-taboo industries into the hottest investment arenas.' Startups in the Spotlight A highlight of the summit was the demo session, where startups showcased technologies shaping the future of defense. Among the featured startups was Haifa-based XMetix, represented by CTO Eran Kuhnreich, who introduced the world’s first automatic personal tourniquet, designed for rapid response during mass casualty events. XMetix’s smart tourniquet, controlled by sophisticated software, requires just one button press to activate and stop the bleeding. This fully automatic device minimizes human error and operates with speed and ease of use, making it suitable for both military and civilian environments. 'This device is intuitive and saves lives within seconds,' Kuhnreich explained. Spear UAV, another participant at the summit, presented its Viper family of loitering munitions. The company, founded in 2017, develops encapsulated drones that can be launched from air, sea, or land. 'We are redefining the battlefield with AI-powered, cross-platform solutions that offer real-time situational awareness and precision targeting,' explained Itamar Ben-Tuvim, the Chief Business Development Officer of the Tel Aviv-based startup. According to conference chairman Prof. Isaac Ben-Israel, startups will play a key role in making sure Israel maintains a technological edge. 'Against the backdrop of the current war, the Israel Ministry of Defense reports a significant increase in engagements with 86 Israeli startups and small companies, amounting to approximately 601 million shekels ($168 million) between October 2023 and September 2024 – five times more than the same period last year.' Looking to the future, Zamir said, 'In a decade, AI-based autonomous systems will lead combat operations across land, sea, and air, reshaping how wars are fought. We must integrate these capabilities now to remain efficient and save lives.'

IDF blocked Iranian planes sent to assist Assad – report	This could be at least one reason why the Syrian regime folded so quickly. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF prevented Iranian planes from landing in Syria over the ten last days of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in an act that hastened the rebels’ victory, Walla reported Wednesday. Army intelligence learned that Iran had decided that the fighting that erupted between Sunni Islamic jihadists and the Syrian army was a dangerous and growing threat that required its assistance with both advisers and arms, and wanted to land planes full of both in airfields throughout the country. The IDF received permission from the highest political echelon to prevent this in various ways, according to the report. Iranian pilots who arrived in the area, for example, received notices to return to their points of origin because they were not authorized to land. The Israeli military has used this tactic multiple times in Lebanon, when Iranian aircraft bringing aid bound for Hezbollah were prevented from landing at Beirut’s international airport. In the last days, the report said, Iran also tried sending empty planes to try to quickly evacuate their senior officials with their families, as well as top Syrian allies, from the country. According to the report, when the IDF identified these planes, they were allowed to land in order to facilitate the withdrawal of Iranian officials responsible over the last several years for efforts to build an Iranian presence over Israel’s northeastern border. The IDF does not know how many planes were prevented from reaching Syria, but army sources are convinced that the action created a chain effect and deepened the pressure on the Syrian regime, the report said. The reported Israeli move may have fed the false claim the Iranians have advanced that both the U.S. and Israel were behind the overthrow of their ally, which was made to excuse their failure to save Assad. It had surprised many that Iran did not seem to make a serious effort to prop up the regime, as it had very successfully, along with major assistance from Hezbollah and Russia, during the civil war that engulfed the country in 2011. Active fighting ending in 2018, with Assad in control of central Syria but other parts held by various forces, including the jihadists, who occupied and ran the Idlib region before breaking out in late November after a ceasefire was signed between a much weakened Hezbollah and Israel. Syria was perhaps the crown jewel in the Islamic Republic’s so-called 'ring of fire' around Israel. With borders along the Jewish state, Lebanon and Iraq, it was perfectly placed to route arms and missiles through compliant terror groups in southern Iraq to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran’s largest proxy army against Israel. It also acted as a forward base for Iran itself, leading to the IDF regularly bombing its military sites in Syria in what was known in Israel as a 'war between the wars.'

10-year-old murdered, 3 wounded in terror shooting targeting bus	The boy was traveling with his family on a bus bound for Jerusalem; terrorist opened fire, struck bus more than 20 times. By World Israel News Staff A ten-year-old boy was murdered in a terror attack targeting a public bus in the Jerusalem area on Wednesday evening, which also wounded three other people. The boy, identified as Yehoshua Aharon Tuvia Simcha, was traveling with his family on a bus bound for Jerusalem. Around 11:30 p.m., a terrorist opened fire at the Al-Khader Junction near Bethlehem, hitting the bus more than 20 times. Footage of the incident circulating on social media showed women and children fleeing the bullet-ridden bus and running towards security forces at a nearby checkpoint, at the entrance to Jerusalem. Magen David Adom paramedics said that they rushed Simcha, who sustained gunshot wounds to his upper body, to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in Jerusalem. 'Unfortunately, after intensive and prolonged resuscitation efforts, the medical team was forced to declare the death of the child, who was evacuated from the attack in critical condition to the trauma unit at Hadassah Ein Kerem,' the hospital said in a media statement. 'Our hearts go out to the family at this difficult time.' The victim is the son of Rabbi Zusha Simcha, the head of a Hasidic yeshiva in Beitar Illit, according to Hebrew-language media reports. A woman in her 40s, who was also shot in the attack, was transported to Sha'are Tzedek Hospital in Jerusalem, where she is listed as being in moderate condition. Two other people were hurt by shattering glass and transported to medical centers for treatment, while others were treated by paramedics at the scene for anxiety. The terrorist who perpetrated the attack was still at large, as of Thursday morning. Israeli security forces set up checkpoints and roadblocks around the city of Bethlehem, where it's believed the shooter fled. 'The terrible attack tonight is not a matter of fate. In Judea and Samaria, too, the time has come to mobilize the population, to maneuver within the cities, and to destroy terrorist infrastructure,' said the Yesha Regional Council in a statement. 'There is no difference between the enemy in Gaza and the enemy in Bethlehem. Terrorism is the same terrorism. The solution must be the same.'

BBC reporter ridiculed for saying Jews form Syria’s ‘diverse popu...	In the 1940s, Syria's Jewish community was 40,000 strong. Today just an estimated 3 remain.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A BBC reporter was ridiculed after saying that Jews have and will comprise Syria's 'diverse' population, the Jewish Chronicle reports. Reporting live from Damascus, the BBC’s chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet said Jews will likely be comfortable returning to the Old City and to live among Muslim and Christian neighbors. Doucet said, 'This is one of the most diverse countries in the Middle East with multiple Christian [and] Muslim sects and you can see it here in the Old City, all the different quarters, Jewish, Muslim, Christian - they’re all here and they want to believe they have a space now as Syria embarks on this new chapter.' The remarks were greeted with outrage and mockery with many pointing out that after an ethnic cleansing of Jews from Syria, there were just three remaining when Bashar Al-Assad was deposed. Orly Goldschmidt, The official spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy to the UK, wrote on X: 'Jewish, Muslim, Christian, they're all here, they want to believe they have a space now&#8230;' 'Except they're not. In the 1940s, Syria's Jewish community was 40,000 strong. Today just an estimated 3 remain.' 'Good luck finding a Jew in Syria for an interview.' The Board of Deputies’ Director of Public Affairs Daniel Sugarman wrote, 'You may find a ‘Jewish Quarter’ in Damascus. You won’t find Jews to interview, though.' The ethnic cleansing of Jews from Arab lands is something that all post-colonial theorists across the world will ignore, deny or downplay,' Sugarman posted on X. Many commenters said Doucet was misleading the public about the history of antisemitism in Syria. Her remarks follow a statement by BBC’s international editor Jeremy Bowen that Israel preferred a 'weak dictator' like Assad to a 'self-confident Islamist militia.' Bowen also asserted Israeli strikes against chemical weapons sites and other military targets in Syria may have prevented a peaceful transition of power. 'Israeli troops and tanks have moved into Syria to create what Israel calls a buffer zone to protect its borders. It has alarmed the UN [United Nations] and others who believe a political process is better for the Syrians and their neighbours than a preemptive military offensive,' the international editor said.

Coalition defeats opposition’s proposal for probe into October 7 ...	Benjamin Netanyahu stated at a press conference that 'many citizens' were opposed to the investigation. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Israeli government defeated a symbolic proposal put forward by the opposition to establish a National Commission of Inquiry into the October 7 massacre. The measure was proposed after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at a press conference that 'many citizens were opposed' to the investigation. MK Pnina Tameno-Shete (National Unity) wrote the 'agenda proposal,' a motion that allows Knesset members to suggest ideas to the plenum. It is not a piece of legislation and has mainly symbolic value. This development comes as Likud MK Ariel Kallner is working on an alternative commission of inquiry, with members set to be appointed equally by both the coalition and the opposition. If the motion had passed, more time would have been granted to debate its merits. MK Benny Gantz (National Unity), who presented the proposal, accused the government of striking it down to avoid taking responsibility for the failures that led to the massacre. Gantz said, 'Our people are not foolish; they understand exactly what you're trying to do. It won't work. We see through your actions. We see the hypocrisy and the transparent attempt to undermine trust in an institution that you all once praised.' A National Commission of Inquiry is the highest level of investigation and works independently of the political echelon. The Chief Justice appoints members of the National Commission of Inquiry, who are empowered to subpoena witnesses and conduct inquiries. Earlier on Wednesday, the High Court of Justice heard arguments in a petition filed by The Zulat Institute, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel (MQG), a group of 86 former Members of Knesset, and others, calling on the government to establish the inquiry. The attorney general argued that the government must agree to discuss the issue, noting that an investigation would be impaired if too much time passes.

There are indications that Israel and Hamas may be approaching a hostages-for-ceasefire deal, with conflicting reports on whether Hamas has provided Egypt with a list of individual hostages. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz told US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin that there is a 'good chance now' for a hostage release deal. He added that after the massacre of October 7th, Israelis are not willing to risk their security, which is one of the reasons the IDF has destroyed strategic targets in Syria to dismantle former leader Assad's military capabilities. Regarding the ceasefire in Lebanon, Katz said there would be 'zero tolerance' for violations. Katz and Austin agreed that Iran poses a major threat, and the two said they would strive to prevent smuggling of weapons to Lebanon via Syria. There are indications that Israel and Hamas may be approaching a hostages-for-ceasefire deal, with conflicting reports on whether Hamas has provided Egypt with a list of individuals—ill, wounded, female, and elderly—who could be released as part of the first phase of such an agreement. A Monday report from the London-based Al-Araby Al-Jadeed claimed that Hamas had handed over a list of hostages to Egyptian intelligence, along with a corresponding list of Palestinian prisoners it seeks to have released in return. The Qatari news outlet also mentioned that four American hostages, who do not meet the specified criteria, were included on the list. Of the eight Israelis with American citizenship believed to be held in Gaza, three are still assumed to be alive: Keith Siegel, who at 65 could be considered elderly; lone soldier Edan Alexander, 20, who was recently featured in a Hamas propaganda video; and Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, from Kibbutz Nir Oz. A senior Hamas official in Lebanon, Ahmed Abdel Hadi, denied the report on Wednesday, telling the local outlet Al Mayadeen that no such list had been provided. He also rejected an Israeli report from the previous week that claimed Israel had presented Egyptian negotiators with an updated version of the ceasefire deal, which had been stalled for months. Hadi stated, 'There was no Zionist offer… nor were there any new ideas for us to consider.'

Jewish ace Max Fried signs record-breaking contract with the New ...	Fried, a Los Angeles native who grew up worshiping Hall of Famer and fellow Jewish southpaw Sandy Koufax, will likely spend the remainder of his career playing in the city with the most Jews in the world. By Jacob Gurvis, JTA Jewish pitcher Max Fried has reportedly signed an eight-year, $218 million contract with the New York Yankees, the largest contract ever for a Jewish player as well as for a left-handed pitcher. Fried, who turns 31 in January, entered the MLB off season as one of the most coveted free agents on the market after a dazzling eight-year run with the Atlanta Braves that included one World Series title. Now he joins a Yankees team coming off not only a World Series defeat but the stinging loss of superstar outfielder Juan Soto, a generational talent who signed a $765 million megadeal with the crosstown Mets. Fried, a Los Angeles native who grew up worshiping Hall of Famer, and fellow Jewish southpaw, Sandy Koufax, will likely spend the remainder of his career playing in the city with the most Jews in the world. He joins fellow Jewish pitcher Scott Effross, who was traded to the Yankees in 2022 but missed all of 2023 and most of 2024 with multiple injuries. (And Jewish Yankees pitching prospect Eric Reyzelman is working his way through the minor leagues.) Some Jewish Yankees fans are already celebrating Fried’s historic signing. A JEWISH MAX ON THE YANKEES! WE DID IT! &mdash; Max Mannis (@MaxMannis) December 10, 2024 Fried has a 3.07 ERA in 151 career starts and is a two-time All-Star, a three-time Gold Glove winner, a Silver Slugger winner, and a 2021 World Series champion. He finished as the runner-up in the 2022 National League Cy Young race. In 2024, Fried posted an 11-10 record with a 3.25 ERA and 166 strikeouts in 174.1 innings. Fried’s $218 million deal, first reported Tuesday by ESPN’s Jeff Passan, is the largest contract in baseball history for a left-handed pitcher in raw terms, topping David Price’s seven-year, $217 million contract signed with the Boston Red Sox in 2015. It’s also by far the most lucrative contract ever for a Jewish player, more than doubling fellow free agent Alex Bregman’s five-year, $100 million contract extension with the Houston Astros in 2019. Shawn Green had previously signed for $84 million with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1999. Bregman, who is currently considered the top free-agent hitter still available, could well blow past Fried’s $218 million deal. Bregman is a two-time All-Star with a Gold Glove, Silver Slugger and two World Series titles. The Astros and Red Sox are rumored to be the favorites to land the 30-year-old third baseman. Jewish players Joc Pederson, Kevin Pillar, and Rowdy Tellez are all free agents as well.

Israeli statisticians who revolutionized data analysis win $1M pr...	The biannual Rousseeuw Prize is awarded by the King Baudouin Foundation, a Brussels-based philanthropic organization. By Pesach Benson, TPS Three Israeli mathematicians officially received the prestigious Rousseeuw Prize for Statistics in Belgium, where 'protests by students and faculty members have called for a full academic boycott of Israeli universities,' Tel Aviv University announced on Wednesday. The $1 million prize, established as an equivalent of the Nobel Prize which does not include mathematical disciplines, recognizes outstanding contributions in statistics that profoundly impact science and society. Protesters demonstrated outside the ceremony at Catholic University of Leuven, which took place on Dec. 3, Tel Aviv University said. Prof. Yoav Benjamini, Prof. Daniel Yekutieli and Prof. Ruth Heller from TAU’s Department of Statistics and Operations Research were honored for their work on the False Discovery Rate (FDR), a statistical methodology for discovering errors among large datasets. Controlling the FDR ensures that the proportion of false positives remains within an acceptable range, making the results more reliable. 'The idea of the FDR originated from the need of medical researchers to examine numerous factors indicating treatment success,' said Benjamini. 'However, in statistics, once a new method is established in one research area, its impact can expand to others. Indeed, FDR methods are now widely applied in diverse fields such as: genomics—where relations between tens of thousands of genetic markers of a specific disease are examined; neuroscience – testing which regions in the brain are activated when a certain task, such as face recognition, is performed; agriculture, economics, behavioral sciences, astronomy, and more,' he explained 'What these fields share is the need to scan massive amounts of possible results within mountains of data to identify significant discoveries.'

Entertainment, sports and war top 2024 Google searches in Israel	Crumble cake headed the list of recipe searches in Israel, followed by honey cake, 'key' challah, and bento cakes. By JNS A mix of entertainment, sports and the war against Hamas in Gaza were the top Google search items in Israel over the last year, according to statistics released this week by the world’s most popular internet search engine. The Euro 2024 soccer championship, Israeli singer-songwriter and actor Idan Amedi, the Israel Defense Forces’ Home Front Command, which offered information about rocket attacks, Israel’s version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' and assassinated Hamas chief Mohammed Deif topped the list of most searched items on Google, according to the website’s 'Year in Search 2024.' Iran came in sixth, followed by the Israeli singer Lior Farhi and Israel’s wartime Eurovision contender Eden Golan; two reality shows closed out the top 10 list. Crumble cake headed the list of recipe searches in Israel, followed by honey cake, 'key challah' and bento cakes. The most asked 'why' questions on Google in Israel were: Why does one eat dairy on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot (which marks the harvest festival and the giving of the Bible); why does one fast on Tisha B’Av (which commemorates the destruction of the two ancient Jewish temples); why does one fast on Yom Kippur; why didn’t Moses enter the Land of Israel; and why does one celebrate Shavuot.

‘For Palestine’ – Congresswoman’s home targeted by bomb threat	Bomb squad dispatched to Republican lawmaker's private residence after she received email claiming a pipe bomb had been hidden in her mailbox - on behalf of Palestine. By World Israel News Staff A Republican congresswoman received a pro-Palestinian bomb threat this week, which tragically ended in an accident which fatally killed a woman. On Monday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene received a bomb threat to her private residence in Georgia, via an email which claimed that a pipe bomb had been left in her mailbox. 'The Rome Police Department's Assistant Chief of Police received an email containing a bomb threat directed towards me,' Greene tweeted, including video footage of a bomb squad inspecting the mailbox in question. Greene wrote that police had traced the source of the threatening email to a Russian internet protocol (IP) address. 'Due to the international nature and severity of this threat, my office is collaborating closely with local and federal law enforcement, including the FBI, to ensure the perpetrator is brought to justice.' 'After receiving this threat, the Rome Police Department quickly dispatched their Bomb Squad to my home to ensure there was no active threat. Unfortunately, this is not the first time the Rome Police Department has been dispatched to my home.' 'Since being elected to Congress, I have been swatted at least nine times—deliberate attempts to provoke a deadly police response through false and highly exaggerated threats.' The email which included the bomb threat was headed 'For Palestine,' and included details on the alleged pipe bomb. 'Using a 1&#215;8-inch threated galvanized pipe, end caps, a kitchen timer, some wires, metal clips, and homemade black powder, I've constructed a pipe bomb which I recently hid in Marjorie Taylor Greene's mailbox,' the email reads. 'Even if Marjorie does not open the mailbox herself I'm still satisfied with the prospect of some pig cops losing their lives of being injured. VIVA VIVA PALESTINA.' Greene lamented that during the police investigation into the bomb threat, a woman was killed in a traffic accident involving police responding to the threat. 'I’m heartsick right now. I was just informed that an innocent woman died today in an auto accident involving a member of the Rome Police bomb squad who was responding to the threat at my home.' One officer was injured in the crash.

‘The Pope can’t rewrite the Bible,’ says Evangelical leader	American Evangelical Christian leader denounces Vatican Nativity scene display showing baby Jesus with a Palestinian keffiyeh. By World Israel News Staff An Evangelical Christian activist has taken aim at a Vatican Nativity scene display which portrayed Jesus as a Palestinian, accusing the Vatican of historical - and religious - revisionism. Laurie Cardoza-Moore, President of Proclaiming Justice to The Nations, condemned the Pope’s inauguration earlier this week in Vatican City of a nativity scene which featured baby Jesus lying on a Palestinian keffiyeh. 'While Israel is fighting for her very existence on seven fronts, antisemites within the Vatican have tried to steal Christmas,' Cardoza-Moore said Wednesday. 'The Pope’s inauguration of a nativity scene that showed baby Jesus cradled in a Palestinian keffiyeh is an affront to Jesus, the Bible, and the eighty percent of Christians who have fled Bethlehem since the Palestinian Authority took over the city.' Cardoza-Moore, whose weekly television show Focus on Israel has an audience of over two billion potential viewers worldwide called the Nativity scene display an attempt by 'subversive' elements within the church to 'hijack' Christmas for political ends. 'Let’s be clear. The Pope can’t rewrite the Bible - Jesus was a Jew from Judea, not a Palestinian. He was born to a Jewish mother in Bethlehem, in Judea – there was no Palestine.' 'Every year, subversive elements within the Church attempt to hijack the holiday and pull the Keffiyeh over our eyes – but it will never work. Instead of paying homage to this blasphemy, the Pope should be publicly supporting the State of Israel in her fight for survival.' 'I would call on all Christians to open their Bible and read. There is no mention of Arafat, Sinwar, or the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The Bible was written in Hebrew, not Arabic. It is time that we wake up and listen to the rhetoric coming out of Teheran and their proxies: first, they are coming for the Saturday People (the Jews) and then, the Sunday People (the Christians).' 'Christians in Israel enjoy full rights under the law. Many Christians are currently fighting in the Israel Defense Forces, on the front lines. Meanwhile, Christians in Bethlehem are second class citizens. The tiny minority which remains in the Holy City is forced to conform with the Palestinian revisionist narrative or else.' 'Pope Francis would do well to read the book of Obadiah, where God told the Prophet that in the last days, He would wipe out the descendants of Edom because they stood by, while their brother Jacob (Israel) was held in captivity and did nothing.' 'This Christmas, let us pray for the Peace of Jerusalem. Let us pray for Brotherhood and Peace on Earth and not do the bidding of the Palestinian Liberation Organization - a Christian-hating, Jew-hating National Socialist movement which has done nothing but bring pain and bloodshed to the people of the Middle East.'

Report: Hamas ready to finalize hostage deal	There are contradictory reports on whether Hamas gave Egypt a list of ill, wounded, female and elderly candidates for the first part of the deal. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News There are some indications that Israel and Hamas may be nearing a hostages-for-ceasefire agreement, with conflicting reports emerging on whether Hamas gave Egypt a list of ill, wounded, female and elderly candidates for release in the first part of such a deal. According to a Monday report in the London-based Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, a list of hostages was handed over to Egyptian intelligence officials along with a parallel list of names of Palestinian prisoners Hamas wants in exchange. The Qatari news outlet also reported that four American hostages who do not fit the criteria were also on the list. Of eight Israelis with American citizenship believed to be held in Gaza, three are still assumed to be alive - Keith Siegel, who at 65 could be considered elderly, lone soldier Edan Alexander (20), who was recently featured in a Hamas propaganda video, and Sagui Dekel-Chen (35), of Kibbutz Nir Oz. A top Hamas official in Lebanon, Ahmed Abdel Hadi, denied the report Wednesday, telling local outlet Al Mayadeen that no such list had been provided. He also denied an Israeli report last week that Israel had provided Egyptian negotiators with a new version of the ceasefire deal that had been in the freezer for months, saying 'There was no Zionist offer&#8230; nor were there any new ideas for us to consider.' The updated version reportedly offered a 42-to-60 day ceasefire while male hostages over age 50, and all female and hostages in precarious medical conditions would be periodically freed. Hope for progress also came from a lightning visit that Shabak head Ronen Bar and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi paid to Cairo Tuesday. In talks with their respective counterparts that also focused on the fall of the Syrian regime, the two discussed a potential hostage deal and what possible flexibility there could be regarding an IDF pullout from the Philadelphi Corridor, the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza that contains the former major Hamas weapons-smuggling routes, both under and above ground. Hamas has reportedly softened its long-held stance, opening to the idea of a temporary ceasefire rather than a permanent one and possible IDF departure only from the Rafah border area initially and not the entire Gaza Strip, before releasing hostages. Who would take charge of the vital area is still up in the air, with the Palestinian Authority being a possibility, although the right-wing members of the government have adamantly opposed the idea in the past. According to a report by Yedioth Aharanoth on Wednesday, senior Israeli officials were informed Tuesday night that Hamas is seeking to reach an agreement regarding a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, though sources cited in the report denied that a list of hostages had been given by Hamas to Israel via Egypt. 'We're not there yet,' said a source familiar with the matter. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan will visit Israel Thursday before going on to mediators Qatar and Egypt to push for a deal before Donald Trump is inaugurated as president on January 20. National Security Council Communications Adviser John Kirby said Tuesday that the Biden administration was working 'extremely hard,' although 'I am not in a position today where I can tell you that we have a deal that is on the brink of completion&#8230;. We do think there’s an opportunity here to get a hostage deal in place.' He also put the ball squarely in Hamas’ court, saying, 'Hamas continues to be the obstacle to that outcome, but we’re pressing on it really, really, hard with that.' He sounded a cautiously optimistic note after referring to the recent implosion of Syria due to its main allies’ inability to protect the now-fallen regime. Hamas, he said, 'absolutely ought to move because there is nobody coming to their assistance there. They can’t rely on Hezbollah. They certainly can’t rely on Iran. This is the time to make a deal.'

Israel colluded with US to depose Assad, claims Ayatollah	Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, claims Tehran has evidence that Assad's ouster was part of a coup orchestrated by Israel and the US. By World Israel News Staff The United States and Israel colluded together to orchestrated the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad over the weekend, coordinating the Syrian rebel attack on the capital city of Damascus, Iran's supreme leader claimed Wednesday. According to a report by IRNA, a mouthpiece of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed that Iran possesses evidence showing that Washington and Jerusalem were responsible for the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria - a key ally of Tehran. 'There should be no doubt that what happened in Syria is the result of a joint American and Zionist plan.' Khamenei was quoted as saying. 'Yes, the neighboring country of Syria has played a clear role in this matter and continues to do so—this is evident to all—but the primary conspirator, the main planner, and the central command room are in the United States and the Zionist regime. We have evidence. This evidence leaves no room for doubt,' Khamenei continued. The Shi'ite cleric vowed that Iran and its proxies would ratchet up their 'resistance' to the West following the collapse of the Assad regime. 'This is resistance. This is the front of resistance: the more pressure is applied, the stronger it becomes.' 'The more atrocities are committed, the more motivated it becomes. The more it is fought, the more it expands. And I tell you that with the power of God, the scope of resistance will encompass the entire region more than before.' Pushing back on reports that the damage done to Hamas and Hezbollah during their wars with Israel, coupled with the collapse of the Assad regime, have left Iran's overseas efforts in disarray, Khamenei said his country 'is strong.' 'That ignorant analyst, unaware of the meaning of resistance, imagines that if resistance weakens, Islamic Iran will also weaken,' Khamenei said. 'And I say, with the help and strength of God, by His permission, Iran is strong, powerful, and will become even more powerful.'

US boxing legend accosted by UK mob over Israel support	Retired boxer Floyd Mayweather, an outspoken supporter of Israel, was surrounded by a mob and physically attacked over his pro-Israel positions during a visit to London. By World Israel News Staff American boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. was accosted by an anti-Israel mob recently during a visit to London, after the locals spotted the prominent pro-Israel pugilist shopping. The incident occurred Tuesday evening while Mayweather was patronizing a jewelry shop in the Hatton Garden neighborhood. According to a report by The Sun which cited a source close to the boxer, while Mayweather was shopping, a group of roughly ten people surrounded him, hurling racial slurs and lambasting him over his public support for the Jewish state. Roughly two dozen others watched the event, the report said, as the mob peppered him with questions regarding his stance on Israel. When asked why he supports Israel, Mayweather said he was 'proud' of it, the source said. At one point, one man attempted to strike the former boxer, before Mayweather's bodyguards escorted him out of the store. Mayweather confirmed the incident in an Instagram post Tuesday night, but downplayed the incident, denying rumors he had been injured during the confrontation. 'Let me set the record straight&#8230;there's no truth to the rumors going around. I wasn't punched or touched in any way.' 'What you're seeing is just my security doing their job to keep things under control.' 'I was in the UK for a quick 48-hour stop to do some shopping, and unfortunately, people let jealousy and negativity fuel false stories. I'm perfectly fine, and there's really nothing more to it.' Mayweather has publicly promoted a number of Israeli charities in recent years. On Sunday, he announced the launch of the Mayweather Israel Initiative, which supports Israeli orphans. 'I’m proud to announce the Mayweather Israel Initiative,' Mayweather wrote on Instagram. 'Over the next year, every orphan in Israel will be visited by the Floyd Mobile and receive special birthday gifts.' 'To all the widows and orphans: keep your heads held high as we honor the cherished memories of those who have passed. A heartfelt thank you to Shai Graucher for your incredible work in making this possible.'

Ex-hostage to Trump: ‘Free them all, I trust you’	Freed American-Israeli hostage urges Donald Trump to do 'everything in his power' to save the captives still held in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff A former Hamas hostage urged president-elect Donald Trump to do 'everything in his power' to free the hostages still held in Gaza, as the two met on his Florida golf course. Judith Ranaan, an American-Israeli, was kidnapped on October 7th alongside her 17-year-old daughter. Ranaan and her daughter live in the Chicago area. They were visiting family in Kibbutz Nahal Oz during the Jewish High Holidays when the terror onslaught began. On October 20th, the pair were the first to be freed by the terror group, after being held for nearly two weeks in the Gaza Strip. Ranaan met briefly with Trump on one of his golf courses in Florida, gifting him with an original painting that she created. According to a summary of the meeting published by Bring Them Home Now on X, Ranaan's main message to Trump was that she 'trusts him.' She also asked that Trump 'do everything in his power to bring all the hostages home - the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial.' Trump has warned the Hamas terror group that he expects the hostages to be freed by the time he takes office on January 20th. If not, Trump recently threatened on X, there will be 'hell to pay.' Many hostage families have expressed optimism that Trump's tough stance on Hamas increases the pressure on the terror group to accept a deal. 'I have a strong conviction that we will bring everyone home—both those alive and those who are not,' Adam Boehler, Trump’s special envoy for hostage issues, recently said. 'The president’s insistence on achieving this before his inauguration has already catalyzed significant progress in negotiations.' It's unclear how many of the some 100 hostages in captivity are still alive. At least 34 of those captives are confirmed to be dead.

House elects Brian Mast, U.S. army veteran who assisted Israeli s...	Mast wore his Israeli army uniform to Congress in the days after Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas massacred 1,200 people inside Israel and took hundreds hostage. By Ron Kampeas, JTA The House of Representatives elected Florida Rep Brian Mast, a zealous pro-Israel Republican who has volunteered with a group that assists the Israeli army, to chair the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee. Mast bested three other contenders to succeed Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, who is term-limited. Insiders say that President-elect Donald Trump lobbied the Republican Steering Committee, which names committee chairs, to choose Mast. 'I have no doubt Congressman Mast — a distinguished combat veteran and experienced member of this committee — will serve the nation well in this role, as he sacrificed in Afghanistan,' McCaul said in a statement. Mast, 44, first endorsed Trump in 2016, when Mast himself was first running for Congress, and has been one of his most loyal defenders in the body, taking a prominent role in this year’s campaign. Mast is also aligned with Trump’s more isolationist bent, opposing U.S. support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. McCaul and the three other contenders, Reps. Joe Wilson of South Carolina, Anne Wagner of Missouri and Darrell Issa of California, are more aligned with traditional Republican internationalist principles. Mast, a Christian and military veteran who lost both legs on duty in Afghanistan in 2010, volunteered in 2015 with Sar-El, a group that places civilians from abroad in support positions with the Israeli army. He has said the experience helped shape him. A dedicated page on his congressional website describes the experience. 'I learned at the Shabbat tables of my hosts just how much each family truly desires peace between every neighbor of Israel, regardless of religion or history,' he said. 'We cannot let Israel face its enemies alone.' Mast wore his Israeli army uniform to Congress in the days after Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas massacred 1,200 people inside Israel and took hundreds hostage. Mast’s pro-Israel posture has often been pugnacious. California Rep. Sara Jacobs, a Jewish Democrat, last year sought to censure Mast for suggesting that there were no innocent Palestinian civilians in the war Israel was waging against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 'I would encourage the other side to not so lightly throw around the idea of innocent Palestinian civilians, as is frequently said,' Mast said at the time. 'I don’t think we would so lightly throw around the term innocent Nazi civilians during World War II.'

With Biden on his way out, GOP-led House ramps up funding for joi...	$47 million will fund U.S.-Israel collaboration on emerging defense technologies, including directed energy weapons, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Congress’s annual defense spending bill includes $500 million in funding for joint military projects with Israel, including a reversal of the Biden-Harris administration’s decision to cease production of a missile interceptor used to defend the Jewish state from Iranian attacks, sources briefed on the matter told the Washington Free Beacon. The GOP-controlled House is scheduled to vote this week on the fiscal year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), an $895 billion spending bill that is a must-pass for Congress before it breaks for the holidays. The legislation funds the American military and virtually all defense priorities across the globe. Included in the bill is $500 million for U.S.-Israel missile defense cooperation, which has emerged as a top priority for GOP lawmakers as the Jewish state continues to battle Iran-backed forces along its border. With the outgoing administration delaying some American arms shipments to Israel, Congress is working to ensure that joint defense projects are safeguarded into the next year when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The House version of the NDAA includes $47.5 million more than the White House requested for U.S.-Israel defense collaboration on emerging technologies, as well as $30 million more than requested for joint anti-tunneling projects, which are vital to ensuring Hamas and Hezbollah cannot conduct Oct. 7-style cross-border raids. It also reverses the Biden-Harris administration's decision to eliminate funding for the production of certain ship-based surface-to-air missiles that were critical to defending Israel from two separate Iranian attacks this year, according to the House Armed Services Committee. 'When I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel in October, I reiterated that Congress’s support for Israel is ironclad,' Rep. Mike Rogers (R., Ala.), the committee's chair, told the Free Beacon. This year’s NDAA, Rogers underscored, 'continues to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship by investing in U.S.-Israel military cooperation and joint exercises.' The United States spent roughly $50 million on anti-tunneling projects it conducted with the Israel Defense Forces last year. That spending is set to increase to $80 million for fiscal year 2025. Another $47 million will fund U.S.-Israel collaboration on emerging defense technologies, including directed energy weapons, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. The bill also seeks to combat growing anti-Semitism across the globe by prohibiting the Pentagon from carrying any goods produced by 'entities that have or are engaged in boycotts of Israel,' according to the House committee’s summary. It also bars the Pentagon from 'using or citing casualty data from Hamas and other terrorist organizations.'

Floyd Mayweather announces new initiative to gift Israeli orphans...	To all the widows and orphans: keep your heads held high as we honor the cherished memories of those who have passed,' Mayweather wrote in an Instagram post on Monday. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Retired boxing legend Floyd Mayweather has announced a new initiative to help Israeli orphans celebrate their birthdays. As part of the Mayweather Israel Initiative, the former undefeated boxing champion will gift every orphan in Israel birthday presents over the next year, and the gifts will be delivered by a truck Mayweather sponsored called the Floyd Mobile. Mayweather’s initiative was first announced on Sunday at an event in Israel hosted by Chessed V’Rachamim, also known as Standing Together, not long before he shared the news on social media. 'Over the next year, every orphan in Israel will be visited by the Floyd Mobile and receive special birthday gifts,' he wrote in an Instagram post on Monday. 'To all the widows and orphans: keep your heads held high as we honor the cherished memories of those who have passed.' Mayweather concluded his social media post by thanking Rabbi Shai Graucher, the founder of Chessed V’Rachamim. The organization has provided support to soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces and those impacted by the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack that took place in southern Israel last year, including monetary assistance, provisions for soldiers, and packages of essentials and toys to displaced families. Mayweather has made a number of contributions to help Israeli civilians and wounded soldiers since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. He visited teenagers whose families were murdered in the Hamas-led massacre, and in early October, Mayweather pledged $100,000 to United Hatzalah of Israel to help the emergency medical service organization purchase 100 bulletproof vests to keep its volunteers safe. At an event in late November for injured IDF soldiers, whom he recently visited, he talked about his unwavering support for the Jewish state. 'When I stood behind Israel … I felt I did what was right,' Mayweather said. 'I take my hat off to the soldiers. Those warriors in Israel — I’m behind you guys, 100 percent. Since the war has started, I’ve been to Israel four, five times. And I will be back … It’s all about peace. I’m all about peace, love, and happiness.'

Israeli startup unveils platform countering AI-driven cyber threa...	CyTwist’s solution leverages counterintelligence methodologies and hyper-targeted probability algorithms to profile threat actors and detect malicious activity in real time. By Pesach Benson, TPS CyTwist, an Israeli startup, unveiled a new cybersecurity platform on Wednesday targeting the escalating threats posed by AI-generated malware and other threats. 'The use of AI in cyberattacks is reshaping the threat landscape, enabling attackers to operate elusively and at speed, capable of gliding past traditional security solutions that rely on signatures and rules. This is where CyTwist can make a real difference,' said Eran Orzel, CEO of the Ramat Gan-based startup. The emergence of AI in cyberattacks has transformed the threat landscape, empowering cybercriminals to develop highly adaptive malware and sophisticated phishing campaigns. These AI-assisted threats exploit meticulously structured code and custom encryption, bypassing conventional defenses and posing significant risks to organizations worldwide. According to industry research, 89% of IT security teams anticipate that AI-augmented cyber threats will have a profound impact on their organizations within the next two years. This growing concern is compounded by the escalating financial toll of cyberattacks, which are increasing by 15% annually. CyTwist’s solution is purpose-built to counteract this trend, detecting malicious behavior earlier in the attack cycle and stopping invaders before they can cause harm. 'Our patented detection engine is specifically engineered to address these challenges, as demonstrated by the results of our red team simulation where we successfully intercepted AI-generated malware that evaded the EDR solution entirely. With the proliferation of AI, there is a lower threshold to create highly effective cyberattacks, and therefore an urgent need for technology like ours to provide a powerful counter,' said Orzal. CyTwist’s solution leverages counterintelligence methodologies and hyper-targeted probability algorithms to profile threat actors and detect malicious activity in real time. Its capabilities were recently validated during a red team live attack simulation with a leading telecom provider. The simulated scenario mirrored a September 2024 cyberattack against French government agencies and private companies. During the test, CyTwist’s engine analyzed suspicious code behaviors to uncover malware designed to evade traditional signature-based and rule-driven tools. The malware’s advanced techniques, evasion tactics and encryption were effectively countered by CyTwist’s technology. One standout feature of CyTwist’s platform is its agentless architecture, which integrates with existing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. Unlike traditional tools that require file scans, CyTwist detects malware based on behavioral patterns, providing a crucial advantage in identifying previously unknown threats. Compared to legacy solutions, which often rely on static signatures or predefined rules, CyTwist’s behavioral approach ensures greater adaptability to emerging and unknown threats. 'We were impressed by CyTwist’s capability of detecting a sophisticated, AI-generated malware that our EDR had failed to pick up. CyTwist provided the critical insights we needed to detect the attack in time, adding a valuable security layer against AI-generated threats and highlighting the necessity for its technology in a market lacking in similar solutions,' said the head of incident response and AppSec at a large telecom operator overseeing the test.

Gaza terrorists fire four rockets at southern Israel	The IDF’s year-plus-long offensive in Gaza has greatly curbed rocket fire from the Strip, although terrorists in the enclave still intermittently target the Jewish state. By JNS Palestinian terrorists in the Gaza Strip fired four rockets at southern Israel on Wednesday morning, setting off sirens in several towns and villages along the border. The Israel Defense Forces intercepted two of the rockets, with the others impacting in open areas, causing no damage. The IDF’s year-plus-long offensive in Gaza has greatly curbed rocket fire from the Strip, although terrorists in the enclave still intermittently target the Jewish state. Last week, the Israeli Air Force intercepted one rocket fired from the northern Gaza Strip. On Nov. 21, terrorist forces in Gaza launched a rocket at the border community of Kerem Shalom, triggering sirens in the kibbutz, located at the Gaza-Israel-Egypt border near the crossing of the same name. The rocket was successfully intercepted, causing no injuries or damage. A rocket from Gaza set off sirens in Kibbutz Erez on Nov. 13, impacting in an open area. No injuries were reported. The community is located less than a mile from the Strip’s northern border and is the namesake of the Erez Crossing. On Nov. 25, the Israeli military reported that Abd el-Halim Abu Hussein, the head of rocket operations for Hamas’s Western Jabalia battalion, was among several terrorists killed in an Israeli airstrike in the northern Gaza city. He was responsible for numerous rocket and mortar attacks against Israeli civilians, as well as against Israeli forces in Gaza.

Biden official pushing for hostage deal ‘within days’ – Report	White House pushing for agreement before president-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20th. By World Israel News Staff A senior Biden administration official is traveling to the Middle East in a final push for a hostage deal, aiming for an agreement before president-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20th. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan will visit Israel, Qatar, and Egypt this week, where he'll meet with officials to discuss ongoing efforts for a deal that would free the Israeli hostages held for 14 months by the Hamas terror group. Two sources with insider knowledge of Sullivan's agenda told Axios that he plans to tell officials to 'do what it takes to conclude the deal within days and start implementing it as soon as possible.' White House spokesperson John Kirby said at a media conference on Tuesday that while 'we are not on the verge of completion of a deal, but we think there is a chance to get a deal done. There is still work to do. Hamas remains the obstacle and we are pressing hard.' Trump's upcoming inauguration and threats of serious consequences should the hostages remain in captivity have put significant pressure on the terror group, and Hamas' leadership are now far more open to negotiations, sources said. 'Until recently, the thinking in Israel was that Hamas doesn't want a deal — now it seems that there is a shift and that Hamas may have changed its mind,' a senior Israeli official told Axios. 'There is a chance of reaching a deal in the coming month before Biden ends his presidency,' the official added. On Tuesday, Sullivan met with the families of American hostages at the White House. Details about the meeting were not made public, but participants said they had discussed ongoing efforts by the Biden administration to secure the release of their loved ones.

Hostage daughter to Biden – ‘Why didn’t you threaten like Trump?’	Daughter of Israeli-American captives slams Biden, world leaders for not demanding the release of the hostages 'or else.' By World Israel News Staff The daughter of two slain hostages slammed President Joe Biden and other world leaders, saying that president-elect Donald Trump's recent tweet threatening the Hamas terror group should have served as an example for the international community. 'All world leaders should have done on October 8, 2023, what Trump did in his tweet,' said Iris Weinstein Haggai told the Times of Israel, referencing the president-elect's pledge that there would be 'hell to pay' for Hamas if they do not release the hostages in the near future. Weinstein Haggai's parents, Gadi and Judi, held both Israel and American citizenship. The couple were brutally murdered in their Kibbutz Nir Oz home during the October 7th terror onslaught, and their bodies were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip. 'Our situation would have been a lot different. We would have saved many lives — not only Israelis, not only hostages’ but also Palestinians — if only world leaders took a stand for the unconditional release of all these hostages,' she told TOI. She said that her criticism 'definitely' applies to Biden, adding that while she appreciated his support for Israel in the immediate aftermath of the massacres, his calls for Hamas to release the hostages were not forceful enough. 'The demand for them to be released ‘or else,’ is what I’m looking for,' Weinstein Haggai said. Biden and other world leaders' failure to threaten serious consequences against Hamas for continuing to hold the hostages had drawn out the war and destruction in the Strip, she said. 'When these Hamas terrorists… see that world leaders don’t pressure them… it sends a message to them that they can execute six beautiful young people and there are no consequences, that they can release these propaganda videos and nobody’s going to do anything,' Weinstein Haggai continued. It's 'never too late' for world leaders to adopt Trump's stance towards Hamas, she said.

US aid group purges dozens of pro-Hamas employees	Washington D.C.-based charity World Central Kitchen fires dozens of Gaza employees accused of terror ties. By World Israel News Staff A Washington D.C.-based charity has purged its employee rolls of dozens of Palestinian Arabs from the Gaza Strip, after Israel accused them of ties to terrorism. Three workers at the World Central Kitchen group told Reuters Tuesday that the aid group had fired 62 of its 500 Gaza employees over ties to terror groups including Hamas. Israel had informed the World Central Kitchen that the employees in question had ties to terrorism, an internal memo to the charity's workers said Tuesday, while emphasizing that the organization itself had no specific evidence regarding the fired workers' affiliation with terrorist groups. 'This should not be taken as a conclusion by WCK that the individuals are affiliated with any terror organization,' the memo reads. 'We do not know the basis for Israel’s decision to flag these individuals.' The decision to fire the 62 employees was taken 'to protect our team and our operations.' Israeli intelligence suspects that World Central Kitchen employees took part in the October 7th massacres in southwestern Israel, an Israeli security official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters. Israel has publicly accused Ahed Azmi Qdeih, a World Central Kitchen worker, of participating in the October 7th attacks. The Israeli Air Force killed Qdeih in an airstrike in Gaza on November 30th. Revelations of Qdeih's terror ties and involvement in the October 7th attacks led to a wider Israeli probe of World Central Kitchen employees, the official told Reuters, during which other suspected terrorists were identified. The 62 Gaza employees named by Israel's probe were found to have 'affiliations and direct connections' with terror groups including Hamas, the Israeli security official said. 'Consequently, senior Israeli officials demanded that WCK terminate the employment of those workers.'

Netanyahu: 'We have no intention of interfering in Syria's internal affairs; however, we will do whatever is necessary to ensure our security.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister sent a message to Syria of openness to good relations, but an intention to act swiftly and decisively to threats. The Prime Minister began his remarks from the Kirya in Tel Aviv, saying, 'We have no intention of interfering in Syria's internal affairs; however, we will do whatever is necessary to ensure our security.' He then referenced Operation 'Bashan Arrow,' stating, 'I authorized the Air Force to target and destroy strategic military assets left by the Syrian military to prevent them from falling into the hands of jihadists.' 'This is similar to the action taken by the British Air Force when they bombed the fleet of the Vichy regime, which was collaborating with the Nazis, to keep it out of Nazi hands,' Netanyahu added. Addressing the new Syrian regime, he remarked, 'We are open to establishing relations with the new government in Syria, but if this regime allows Iran to re-establish itself there, facilitates the transfer of Iranian weapons, or supports Hezbollah, or if it attacks us, we will respond with force and impose a heavy price.' Netanyahu concluded, 'What happened to the previous regime will also happen to this one.' The IDF announced that it has struck 320 targets and destroyed at least 70% of Syria’s military capabilities to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorist groups, Arutz Sheva reports. More than 350 Israeli fighter jets took art in the operation 'Bashan’s Arrow' to neutralize military sites once controlled by the Assad regime which fell to rebel fighters. The IDF has established the first Israeli military presence in Syria since the end of the Yom Kippur War in 1973. The IDF stated, 'In the past 48 hours, we targeted and struck the majority of Syria’s strategic weapons stockpiles, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist groups.'

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF announced that it has struck 320 targets and destroyed at least 70% of Syria's military capabilities to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorist groups, Arutz Sheva reports. More than 350 Israeli fighter jets took art in the operation 'Bashan's Arrow' to neutralize military sites once controlled by the Assad regime which fell to rebel fighters. Among the targets were advanced military systems such as tanks, fighter jets, helicopters, air defense systems, missile-equipped ships, rockets, arms manufacturing facilities, munitions storage sites, Scud missiles, cruise missiles, coastal defense missiles, drones, and various other weaponry. The IDF has established the first Israeli military presence in Syria since the end of the Yom Kippur War in 1973. The IDF stated, 'In the past 48 hours, we targeted and struck the majority of Syria's strategic weapons stockpiles, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist groups.' Israel Defense Forces International Spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told reporters on Tuesday, 'We are taking action to prevent lethal strategic weapons from reaching hostile forces. This has been our approach for years, carried out in various ways and under different circumstances, and it continues to be our focus now.' He continued, 'Our Chief of General Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, stated that our primary focus is monitoring Iran's movements and interests. Our secondary focus is on local factions gaining control of the area—assessing their actions, behavior, and deterrence capabilities—and ensuring they do not mistakenly direct their efforts toward us.' He added, 'I’ll simply say that we’re doing our job to ensure strategic weapons don’t fall into the wrong hands. This is something that should matter to many forces in the region, not just Israel—ensuring there are no strategic threats in this area.'

Deficit explodes to $622B in just 2 months under Biden’s watch	With the national debt now approaching $36 trillion, newly appointed Trump advisor Elon Musk is warning that failure to address the deficit threatens critical programs including defense, Medicare, and Social Security. By Jewish Breaking News The federal government’s deficit is soaring to historic levels under President Joe Biden, with new data showing Washington has racked up $622 billion in red ink just two months into the fiscal year. Monday’s Congressional Budget Office report reveals a 40% surge in deficit spending compared to 2023, driven by a November shortfall of $365 billion. Even accounting for technical adjustments in payment timing, the CBO’s analysis shows the deficit running $88 billion ahead of last year’s pace. Gone are the days when trillion-dollar deficits were unthinkable, never topping $1 trillion before the Covid-19 pandemic struck. Now, with last year’s deficit hitting $1.8 trillion under Biden’s watch, they’re becoming the new normal. Making matters worse, the Fed’s inflation-fighting rate hikes have sent borrowing costs through the roof. For the first time ever, Washington’s annual interest payments topped $1 trillion. Even after counting returns on government investments, taxpayers are still on the hook for $882 billion in interest costs. With the national debt now approaching $36 trillion, newly appointed Trump advisor Elon Musk is warning that failure to address the deficit threatens critical programs including defense, Medicare, and Social Security. 'If we don’t fix the deficit, everything will suffer,' Musk wrote on X. 'It’s not optional.' Musk, alongside fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, has been tasked by the President-elect with addressing the country’s surging debt. On November 12, Donald Trump announced that the two would serve as co-heads of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly created entity focused on reducing government expenditures, slashing regulations, and enacting cost-cutting initiatives throughout the federal government. Last month, Musk promised to cut 'at least $2 trillion' from US government spending. However, budget experts say that even if the tech billionaire shut down complete federal departments such as homeland security, transportation, agriculture, and others, it still wouldn’t reach his target.

Days after Trump’s victory, Biden-Harris admin granted Iran $10 b...	This policy of appeasement needs to end on January 20, and locking down these accounts, so Iran can't get access, should be priority one,' said Richard Goldberg, a former White House National Security Council member. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon The Biden-Harris administration waived sanctions on Iran three days after the November election, providing Tehran access upward of $10 billion in once-frozen funds, according to a copy of the non-public order transmitted to Congress and reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined on November 8 that 'it is in the national security interest of the United States' to waive mandatory economic sanctions that bar Iraq from transferring upward of $10 billion to Iran in electricity import payments. The Biden-Harris administration has renewed the waiver repeatedly over the objections of congressional Republicans, who warned that the cash helped fuel terrorism and Iran's war against Israel. In one case, the administration signed off on the sanctions relief one month after Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel. The most recent iteration of the waiver lifts sanctions for 120 days, at which time the incoming Trump administration will have to decide whether Tehran will continue receiving the relief. Though the first Trump administration did green-light the same waiver—causing tension with some congressional Republicans—it narrowly tailored the waiver to restrict Iranian access to the cash. The Biden State Department tweaked the waiver last year to allow Tehran to convert the funds from Iraqi dinars to euros, then hold those euros in bank accounts based in Oman. Access to a widely traded currency like the euro enables Iran to more easily spend the cash in international markets. Under the first Trump administration, Iran had to keep the cash in an escrow account in Baghdad, making it more difficult to access. The State Department confirmed last week that it issued the waiver. 'We remain committed to reducing Iran's malign influence in the region,' State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters during a briefing. 'Our viewpoint is that a stable, sovereign, and secure Iraq is critical to these efforts.' The Biden State Department maintains that Iran is only permitted to use the funds for humanitarian needs, including medicines and other supplies. Republican critics argue that money is fungible, meaning that Tehran will have an easier time diverting its dwindling cash reserves to its regional terror proxies, such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, should it have access to the sanctioned cash for other purposes. The State Department declined to comment further. President-elect Donald Trump, who nearly bankrupted Iran during his first term in office, has pledged to restart his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Tehran. Richard Goldberg, a former White House National Security Council member who worked the Iran portfolio, welcomed that pledge. 'Joe Biden and his team are taking credit for bringing down Assad just a few weeks after renewing a sanctions waiver to give Iran access to billions of dollars,' Goldberg said. 'Give me a break. This policy of appeasement needs to end on January 20, and locking down these accounts so Iran can't get access should be priority one.'

Levant’s oldest known ritual site discovered in Galilee cave	Acoustic tests conducted in the area revealed enhanced natural acoustics, likely amplifying communal rituals involving singing, prayer, and dancing. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli archaeologists working in the Western Galilee uncovered the earliest known evidence of communal worship in the Levant, dating back approximately 35,000 years, a team of researchers from several universities announced on Tuesday. The ritual complex was found in the depths of the Manot Cave, an archaeological and paleontological site first discovered in 2008. A team of researchers from the University of Haifa, Ben-Gurion University, and Tel Aviv University, described the worship area as enclosed by natural stalagmites and featuring a turtle shell-shaped rock engraved with intricate geometric patterns. The research team’s study was recently published in the peer-reviewed PNAS journal. 'The engraved rock was deliberately positioned in the deepest, darkest part of the cave, suggesting it held significant spiritual or symbolic value,' said Haifa University’s Dr. Omry Barzilai, one of the research leaders. 'Its turtle-shell design might represent a totem or mythological figure, offering a glimpse into the spiritual world of Paleolithic hunter-gatherer groups.' The ritual complex was discovered in an area distinct from the cave’s daily activity zones, marked by ash remains suggesting the use of torches to illuminate the space. Acoustic tests conducted in the area revealed enhanced natural acoustics, likely amplifying communal rituals involving singing, prayer, and dancing. 'This is an unprecedented discovery of a space with ‘audio-visual equipment’ centered around a ritual object, providing the first evidence of communal rituals in the Levant,' said Tel Aviv University Prof. Israel Hershkovitz. He noted that darkness, often associated with rebirth and renewal, would have imbued the site with sacred significance. The ritual complex, dated to 35,000–37,000 years ago, coincides with the emergence of the Aurignacian culture, known for symbolic objects and cave paintings in Europe. Artifacts from this culture, including flint tools, bone implements, and shell beads, were also discovered in Manot Cave. In an adjacent hidden chamber, researchers uncovered a complete deer antler bearing signs of use, possibly linked to the rituals performed in the complex. 'Antlers were a key resource for crafting tools in Upper Paleolithic cultures, and their deliberate placement suggests a connection to the spiritual activities in the cave,' Barzilai explained. To confirm that the turtle-shell engravings were man-made, the researchers used a confocal microscope, a powerful imaging tool that uses laser technology and optical systems to capture highly detailed, high-resolution images of a specimen. 'The fine micro-linear scratches indicate advanced artistic skills and a deep cultural connection to symbols,' said Tel Aviv University Prof. Rachel Sarig, who led that analysis. 3D mapping of the cave further emphasized the deliberate separation between the ritual complex and daily activity areas near the entrance. 'This reinforces the idea of a designated sacred space, underscoring its importance to the community,' said Alexander Wigman, of the Israel Antiquities Authority. Manot Cave, systematically excavated since 2010, has yielded numerous significant finds, including the oldest modern human fossil discovered outside Africa. 'Identifying communal rituals in the Paleolithic era is a breakthrough in our understanding of humanity’s spiritual and social evolution, providing a profound connection to our ancient ancestors,' said Barzilai.

Birthright Israel extends age limit to 50 for volunteers helping ...	The extended age range will also allow alumni who participated in Birthright trips up to 25 years ago to revisit Israel and reconnect with the country through volunteer work. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Birthright Israel will raise the age limit for its subsidized volunteer program in Israel to 50 starting in 2025 in an effort to encourage more people to visit the Jewish state and help rebuild Gaza border communities impacted by the deadly Oct. 7 terrorist attack last year, the organization announced on Monday. 'The decision responds to the urgent needs in Israel, particularly in areas near the Gaza envelope and along the Lebanon ceasefire zone,' Birthright Israel said in a released statement. 'The program aims to mobilize volunteers to support community rebuilding efforts in these regions and assist with various projects in central Israel, including the Tel Aviv area.' The program’s age range was previously set at 18-40, but starting next year, Jewish adults until the age of 50 will be able to participate in Birthright’s volunteer activities in communities around Israel. The hands-on volunteer opportunities include assisting on restoration projects at kibbutzim and other areas majorly affected by the Oct. 7 massacre and ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Volunteers can help 'rebuild kibbutzim, support community re-building efforts, provide food security assistance, and participate in packing and distribution tasks.' Volunteers work for 4-6 hours per day and are provided with transportation to and from their volunteer sites. The extended age range will also allow alumni who participated in Birthright trips up to 25 years ago to revisit Israel and reconnect with the country through volunteer work. It additionally promotes multigenerational experiences by letting young adults volunteer alongside their parents. A total of 8,000 people have already participated in Birthright Israel’s volunteer program and the organization said it anticipates 10,000 more volunteers in 2025. 'Every Birthright participant arriving in Israel will contribute by volunteering, ensuring that giving back is a cornerstone of the Birthright experience,' said Birthright Israel CEO Gidi Mark. 'This initiative underscores Birthright Israel’s commitment to fostering global Jewish solidarity and strengthening ties to the land and people of Israel through meaningful action.' Participants of Birthright Israel’s volunteer program are reimbursed for flights (up to $900), and also receive a partial food subsidy ($100 per week) and safe housing in major cities. Applicants need to identify as Jewish, know basic English, and have a passport that is valid for at least six months after the end date of the program.

Netanyahu testifies in court, mocking ‘absurd’ charges as Israel ...	Israeli prime minister chides court after being forced to testify in court Tuesday despite unprecedented geopolitical situation including a multifront war, calls charges against him 'absurd.' By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the witness stand Tuesday, testifying in his own corruption trial in a Tel Aviv court, after the Jerusalem District Court ruled against a motion filed by the premier's attorneys to limit the amount of time he will be required to answer questions in court. With the courtroom packed with Coalition lawmakers and ministers, Netanyahu testified in the Tel Aviv District Court beginning at 10:00 a.m. Tuesday, after the Attorney-General and Jerusalem District Court rejected petitions to either delay Netanyahu's testimony or limit his time on the witness stand. Netanyahu himself reflected on the complicated geopolitical situation facing Israel, as he is called to testify for six hours a day, three days a week, from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays. 'I want to talk about it, I want to testify,' Netanyahu said of his defense in multiple corruption cases. 'I am leading Israel and the State of Israel on seven front-war, and I thought and still think I can do all these things at once.' 'But a few days ago, an earthquake happened in our region,' Netanyahu continued, referring to the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria over the weekend. 'We have already changed the face of the Middle East, and this has global effects. It requires my attention. It is possible to find a balance between the needs of the country and the needs of the trial.' The prime minister went on to mock the charges against him, in particular accusations that he manipulated government policy to ensure he would receive positive press coverage, calling the charges 'absurd.' 'If I wanted good press, I could have taken the agenda of the left and then I wouldn’t be standing here today.' It is 'absurd that all my life, all my public service has been the total opposite,' Netanyahu continued. The prime minister emphasized that he has waited to testify in court to challenge the accusations against him, but that his responsibilities now as premier take precedence. 'I want to avoid trial? Nonsense! For eight years I've been waiting for this day, to dissolve the baseless accusations. There was no crime, so they searched for a crime.' Outside the court house, Netanyahu's supporters and critics gathered Tuesday, with the former criticizing the judiciary, accusing it of conducting a putsch against the Israeli government, while the latter demanded Israel reach a hostage deal with Hamas.

Iranian leaders ‘punching each other’ over Syria collapse – repor...	Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in disarray after Assad’s stunning defeat in Syria, leaving IRGC leaders to blame each other for ally’s sudden collapse. By World Israel News Staff Iran's leadership is facing an unprecedented crisis following the collapse of Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime, with internal turmoil brewing within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) over the loss of Iranian influence in the region, Britain’s Telegraph reported Monday. Sources close to the situation told The Telegraph that there is growing dissent among IRGC commanders, with accusations flying over their failure to secure Assad's survival despite years of Iranian intervention. For over a decade, Tehran invested billions of dollars in an effort to bolster the Assad regime, viewing his regime as a cornerstone of its regional strategy to maintain proximity to Hezbollah and secure its interests near Israel’s border. Yet, the unexpected flight of Assad as rebels neared Damascus has thrown the entire plan into disarray, leaving the IRGC scrambling to understand the full implications of the collapse. An Iranian official described the situation within the IRGC as one of intense frustration, with commanders reportedly at each other's throats, confronting each other with accusations and anger. 'The atmosphere is like something between almost punching each other, punching the walls, yelling at each other and kicking rubbish bins. They are blaming each other, and no one is taking responsibility,' the official was quoted as saying At the center of the storm is Brig. Gen. Esmail Qaani, the head of the Quds Force, who is being blamed for allowing Assad’s military to disintegrate. Although few dare to confront him publicly, an IRGC source has accused Qaani of failing to prevent the unraveling of Iranian interests in Syria. The loss of Syria is seen as a major blow to Iran, which relied on the country as a key supply route to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. With Iranian operatives either killed or fleeing, Tehran now faces a dire situation with no clear path forward. The crisis has also triggered speculation that Qaani may be replaced, especially after his sudden disappearance from public view following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah by Israel in September. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has summoned senior IRGC commanders in recent days to address the deteriorating situation, with heated discussions about how to salvage Iran's remaining influence in the region.

‘Israeli hostages are in grave mortal danger,’ warns President He...	Israel's president hosts emergency discussion on the medical condition of the hostages, amid fears their weakening condition could leave them vulnerable to infection, hypothermia, or starvation during the upcoming winter season. By World Israel News Staff Israeli President Isaac Herzog hosted medical experts and relatives of Israeli captives held hostage in the Gaza Strip at an emergency meeting in the president's residence in Jerusalem Tuesday to address concerns over the hostages physical condition. The event coincided with International Human Rights Day, and marked 431 days since the captives were taken hostage by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip. 'We are marking 431 days of the most unimaginable violations of human rights,' President Herzog said. 'Today, on International Human Rights Day, not a single right has been upheld by the criminal and terrorist organization Hamas.' 'The entire world must cry out with all its might against this heinous organization and its flagrant violations of human rights, as we've clearly heard in the past hour.' During the meeting Tuesday, health officials voiced their concerns over the condition of the remaining hostages, and provided the president with a report outlining estimates on the captives' medical status, along with the risks they face in extended captivity. 'Based on the report presented here, on various sources of information before me, and on the data I continuously receive, it is palpably clear that the hostages are in grave mortal danger,' Herzog warned. 'Everything must be done, by all possible means, to bring them home.' 'Throughout the year, we have explored every avenue to enhance and provide medical aid to those held in the tunnels of Gaza. We engaged countless times with the Red Cross and other entities, attempting to deliver medications and prescriptions, facilitating meetings between the Red Cross and hostage families, and sharing information. But all efforts hit a wall—the wall of Hamas, which prevented any aid from getting through.' President Herzog expressed optimism that a hostage deal can be reached, noting 'renewed' attempts to reach an agreement amid a 'global convergence' on the matter. 'There is now a significant renewed effort underway. I sincerely thank outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump. Their actions have brought about meaningful change.' 'These efforts must advanced as quickly as possible. Silence is often golden, but the effort itself is critically important. Personally, I engage in discussions with global leaders daily on this very issue.' Last month, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum’s health team, headed by epidemiologist and former chairman of Israel’s Association of Public Health Physicians Dr. Hagai Levine, released a report regarding the conditions of the surviving Israeli captives held hostage in the Gaza Strip. The report said that given the duration and conditions the captives have been held in since October 7th, 2023, they have likely lost a significant amount of body mass, potentially as much as half of their pre-invasion weight. As a consequence of their long-term nutritional deficiencies, the report warns, the surviving hostages are likely suffering from 'dangerously low muscle' mass levels, and are now 'highly vulnerable to hypothermia, frostbite, and respiratory infections,' leaving them at elevated risk for a plethora of maladies in the upcoming winter season.

‘Netanyahu did more against terror in a year than the EU did in 7...	Dutch MP meets with Israeli leaders, praises Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his handling of the war against Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran. By World Israel News Staff A Dutch lawmaker lauded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the war against Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran during a visit to Israel this week. MP Geert Wilders, leader of the right-wing Dutch Party for Freedom, met with senior Israeli leaders in Jerusalem Monday, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Isaac Herzog, Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, Defense Minister Israel Katz, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, Energy Minister Eli Cohen and a number of lawmakers. During his visit, Wilders also toured the Samaria region, hosted by Samaria Regional Council chairman Yossi Dagan. During his visit Monday and following his meeting with Netanyahu, Wilders praised Netanyahu, saying the Israeli premier had done more to combat terrorism since October 7th, 2023, than the European Union has in 70 years - referencing the forerunners of the EU, including the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community, established in the 1950s. 'Just spoke to Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu of Israel in Jerusalem and told him that in 1 year -' by crushing Hamas, pulverizing Hezbollah and significantly weakening Iran - he has done more to fight (international) terrorism than the EU has done in the last 70 years!' Wilders tweeted Monday night. A day before his visit, Wilders denounced the International Criminal Court over its efforts to prosecute Netanyahu, arguing that Israel 'deserves our full support for they are also fighting our fight against the evil forces of terror from Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran.' 'If Israel would fall, the West will be next. Losing is no option. Neither is being silent. Support and perseverance is the only way.' A Eurosceptic and critic of Islam, Wilders has called to freeze immigration to the Netherlands from the Third World, tougher anti-terror measures, and for steps to combat Islamic radicalization.

Adam Schiff is sworn into Senate on edition of Maimonides’ Jewish...	Maimonides, also known as Rambam and considered one of history’s preeminent Jewish scholars, wrote the Mishnah Torah in the 12th century as an all-inclusive guide to the system of Jewish law. By Ron Kampeas, JTA Adam Schiff, the freshman Democratic senator from California, is being sworn into office on a 1490 edition of Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah, one of the most revered and prominent codes of Jewish law. Schiff, in a statement ahead of his swearing in on Monday, said the edition, published in the duchy of Milan, now in northern Italy, was 'a monumental legal code and one of the most organized, comprehensive, and influential works of Jewish law.' The edition was published by Gershom ben Mosheh ish Sontsino, a scion of a pioneering Jewish printing family known as Soncino. A publishing house in the family’s name is still active. A spokeswoman for Schiff, until this week a U.S. Representative and a former federal prosecutor, said he chose the volume, held by the Library of Congress, in part because of his concerns about the state of the rule of law as President-elect Donald Trump returns to office. Schiff led one of Trump’s impeachments in the president’s first term and co-chaired the congressional investigation into the deadly Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol riot, which was spurred by Trump’s false claims he won that election. Trump, who has promised 'retribution' against his perceived enemies, said this week Schiff should be jailed. The spokeswoman said that Schiff was also attracted to the volume because of his intellectual curiosity. 'It’s simply his nerdy interest in how old this volume is and how comprehensive it is,' she said. Maimonides, also known as Rambam and considered one of history’s preeminent Jewish scholars, wrote the Mishnah Torah in the 12th century as an all-inclusive guide to the system of Jewish law. Written in Hebrew and divided into 14 volumes, it is a fixture of Jewish houses of study and other educational institutions. Schiff is not the only Jewish elected official who in recent years chose to be sworn into office on volumes that reflect why they got into politics. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, in 2023 was sworn in on a stack of three Hebrew Bibles, including the one that was on the bimah when a gunman massacred 11 Jewish worshipers in a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018. Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, in 2021 was sworn in on a book of Hebrew scripture once owned by an Atlanta rabbi whose synagogue building was bombed by white supremacists in 1958. Vice President Kamala Harris swears in Sens.-elect Andy Kim (D-NJ) and Adam Schiff (D-CA) as well as Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-NE), who won special election to the seat he had been previously appointed. pic.twitter.com/8kvyxPggYc — CSPAN (@cspan) December 9, 2024 The post Adam Schiff is sworn into Senate on edition of Maimonides’ Jewish legal code printed in 1490 appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/adam-schiff-is-sworn-into-senate-on-edition-of-maimonides-jewish-legal-code-printed-in-1490/	2024-12-10T03:09:09-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/adam-schiff.jpg
Palestinian Authority mouthpiece slams ‘white, racist’ Americans ...	Official Palestinian Authority daily repeatedly accuses President-elect Donald Trump of 'racism,' castigates 'white and racist majority' of Americans for backing him in 2024 election. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Palestinian Authority-controlled media outlets have repeatedly castigated not only President-elect Donald Trump before and after his election last month, but have also taken aim at the more than 77.2 million American voters who sent him back to the White House. An analysis of official Palestinian Authority media outlets conducted by Palestinian Media Watch found numerous instances before and after the November election of attacks against both Trump and the United States as a whole, over his election. On November 7th, two days after the election, the PA-controlled daily newspaper Al-Hayat Al-Jadida ran a piece by columnist Omar Hilmi al-Ghoul castigating Trump as 'racist,' and denouncing the 'white and racist majority' of Americans for voting him into office. 'The white and racist majority from among the Evangelists voted for Republican candidate [Trump]. More than this, the president-elect succeeded in penetrating sectors of black and Latino Americans, despite his racism, and they voted for him.' A caricature of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, run by Falestinona, published by the Fatah party's Information and Culture Commission in Lebanon, Nov. 15, 2024. (PMW) On November 3rd, two days before the presidential election, PA television hosted Syrian pundit Tahsin Halabi on its Capital of Capitals program, during which Halabi accused the American public of chauvinism. 'The American public is a chauvinist public,' Halabi said. 'It will not let a woman be president.' Nor were the criticisms of the United States limited to media outlets. On November 15th, Mahmoud al-Habbash, an advisor to PA chairman Mahmoud Abbas, said in an interview published on YouTube that the U.S. was lying about its desire to end the war in Gaza, calling Israel America's 'errand boy.' 'You say that Israel is imposing its will on the U.S. That isn't correct. The truth is that the one who is imposing its will is the U.S. Israel is working as 'an errand boy'&#8230; for the U.S. and for the U.S. administration.' 'It is carrying out the policies of the American administration&#8230; We must not be deceived by the American attempts to mislead world public opinion and present the US as if it is actually interested in stopping the [Gaza] war.' The U.S., al-Habbash continued, is the 'main threat to humanity,' and is to blame 'for the lack of security, peace, and stability in the Middle East region, and the world.'

Jewish family victimized by Assad ‘relieved’ after regime’s downf...	Woman whose grandfather was tortured by Hafez al-Assad's regime said her family is 'very happy' to see the dynasty toppled. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli woman whose grandfather was imprisoned and tortured by the Syrian regime during the 1970s said she is celebrating the downfall of the Assad dynasty. Yaffa Levy, the daughter of a Syrian-born immigrant to Israel, shared how her family's personal story of suffering under Hafez al-Assad with Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. Levy's father, Marco (Mordechai) Khalifa, was born in Syria to a wealthy family. As a teenager, he became a staunch Zionist and helped smuggle Syrian Jews - who were banned from leaving the country - to Israel via the Golan Heights. He spent the majority of his time in Israel, with occasional missions to Lebanon and Syria to aid local Jewish communities in immigrating to Israel. Khalifa was unable to maintain consistent contact with his parents and siblings, who had remained in Syria. At some point in the 1970s, Hafez al-Assad's regime learned of Khalifa's operations and moved to brutally punish the family, in order to discourage other Syrian Jews from Zionist missions. Despite not having any involvement with his son's activities, Khalifa's father was arrested, imprisoned, and tortured. According to Levy, Khalifa only learned of his father's fate after a clandestine visit to his family's home. Levy said that her grandmother relayed that Khalifa needed to leave Syria and return to Israel as soon as possible, telling him that his father was incarcerated and had his 'eyes gouged out' by his Syrian captors. Khalifa obeyed his mother, never again seeing his family or returning to Syria. 'Dad was a Zionist. He returned to Israel, fought in all the wars, both in mandatory service and in the reserves, participated in the liberation of the Western Wall, started a family. He always felt responsible for what happened to his father,' Levy told Ynet. 'It really stayed with him. Along with the longing for his mother and his family who remained in Syria, [the guilt] with him until his last day.' Levy said that it was a 'shame' that her father, who died more than 30 years ago, had not lived to see the regime being toppled. Still, the ouster of Bashar al-Assad does provide a sense of justice to the family, Levy said. 'We are very happy,' said Levy. 'We saw how much pain Dad was in. [The end of the Assad dynasty] is a great relief for us.'

IDF tanks nearing Damascus, 250 weapons sites bombed: Report	Israeli tanks spotted on outskirts of Damascus, as intense bombing campaign of weapons depots continues. By World Israel News Staff Israeli tanks are present on Syrian soil just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Damascus, according to reports from Arabic-language media. According to Al-Mayadeen, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, IDF tanks were seen in Qatana, marking the deepest entry of the Israeli military into Syrian territory in decades. Qatana, a city in southern Syria with a significant Christian and Awalite population, is located to the east of Mount Hermon. The tallest mountain in the region, Israel previously held one side of Mount Hermon, with Syria maintaining partial control of the site. On Sunday, as the Syrian army withdrew from the area, Israel captured the Syrian side of the mountain, gaining full control of Mount Hermon. Following the ouster of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad from power by rebel groups, the IDF crossed into the former Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between Israel and Syria. 'We gave the Israeli army the order to take over these positions to ensure that no hostile force embeds itself right next to the border of Israel,' said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday as he toured the border region. 'This is a temporary defensive position until a suitable arrangement is found,' Netanyahu said. Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that he ordered the military to completely seize the DMZ and bolstered troop presence along the border. The IDF has been engaged in a campaign to destroy 'strategic weapons' in Syria that could potentially be obtained by rebel groups, including 'surface-to-air missiles, air defense systems, surface-to-surface missiles, cruise missiles, long-range rockets, and coast-to-sea missiles,' Katz said in a statement. Since the fall of Damascus on Sunday, the IDF is believed to have bombed at least 250 strategic military sites in Syria, including air force bases, chemical weapons research facilities, and weapons depots. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon stressed that the IDF was taking 'limited and temporary measures' to ensure that the conflict within Syria would not spill over to Israeli territory. 'It is important to emphasize, however, that Israel is not intervening in the ongoing conflict between Syrian armed groups; our actions are solely focused on safeguarding our security,' Danon told the UN Security Council.

Netanyahu: Axis of evil is crumbling, ‘didn’t happen by accident’	We are dismantling the axis of evil. This didn't happen by accident or on its own &#8230; we are determined to change the face of the Middle East.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a rare press conference on Monday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's presence in Syria after the downfall of the Assad regime marked a 'new chapter' and that 'everyone understands the importance of our being on the Golan Heights.' Netanyahu began the press conference by addressing the deaths of four IDF soldiers in southern Lebanon and three in northern Gaza. Netanyahu addressed their families, 'Along with the entire nation, I embrace you from the depths of my heart.' Regarding the overthrow of Assad's regime in Syria, Netanyahu said, 'Yesterday, a new and dramatic chapter began in the history of the Middle East – the fall of the Assad regime. This was a key pillar in Iran's axis of evil, and everything Iran had invested has now crumbled.' Netanyahu said the series of events illustrates the importance of Israel holding on to the Golan Heights. 'Today, everyone recognizes the immense importance of our presence on the Golan Heights, not at its base,' he said. 'We want to see change in Syria, both for our own benefit and for the well-being of the Syrian people,' Netanyahu said. 'We are dismantling the axis of evil. This didn't happen by accident or on its own. As I said to municipal leaders in southern Israel, we are determined to change the face of the Middle East.' Regarding the situation in Gaza, Netanyahu said, 'We are focused on eliminating the remnants of Hamas' military power and its governing capability while ensuring the safe return of all those kidnapped—every last one of them.' Netanyahu dismissed criticism that the goal of 'total victory' in Gaza was unrealistic. 'If we had ended the war prematurely, we would not have eliminated Sinwar and Nasrallah, nor would we have confronted Hezbollah, Syria, or struck Iran. All of this is happening because we insisted on total victory. What they once mocked is now becoming reality.'

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declared on Monday during a Religious Zionist Party meeting that 'it's time to take control of Gaza' and to take 'decisive action' in Judea and Samaria. Smotrich emphasized that time was of the essence to entirely deprive Hamas of its power and influence. 'It's time to take control of Gaza and strip Hamas of its civilian authority, cutting off its lifeline,' he stated. Smotrich pointed out the fall of Assad's regime to rebel forces as inspiration to take swift and decisive action against Hamas. 'We've seen in Syria how regime leaders scatter like rats once they realize they've lost control. The same can happen in Gaza. We're close—we've already made substantial progress. We need to take the next step to achieve a decisive and clear victory,' Smotrich said. The Finance Minister also criticized hostage release deals that would free only a portion of the hostage and not others an said such agreements can compromise Israel's military goals. 'Instead of negotiating partial deals that leave hostages behind, undermine the progress we've made in the war, and reduce our chances of victory, we must push forward. We must stop fearing the unknown and do what is necessary,' he said. Smotrich said that if Israel 'takes the necessary steps,' Hamasa leaders will 'flee like rats' and 'This will bring all the hostages home and remove the threat to Israel once and for all.' Smotrich also described Judea and Samaria as 'Iran's foothold' and called for the elimination of terror cells and increased settlements to maintain security.

Drone from Yemen hits Yavne apartment, IDF considers retaliation ...	The drone originated from Yemen and was thought to have come from the direction of the sea towards Sderot before heading north. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News After a drone from Yemen hit a penthouse in Yavne, central Israel, the military is investigating failures to alert the public or intercept the drone and is considering a retaliation against the Houthis, Ynet reports. The drone originated from Yemen and was thought to have traveled seaward to Sderot and headed north. Although the drone was briefly detected in Ashdod, tracking systems no longer saw it, and therefore, interception was impossible. The IDF is trying to determine how the drone evaded detection systems while finding ways to boost defense systems and retaliate against threats from the Houthis in Yemen. 'The IDF received reports of a suspicious aerial object falling near Yavne. No siren was activated, and the incident is currently under investigation,' the IDF spokesperson said in a statement. A later update said, 'Following the initial report, a UAV, likely launched from Yemen, crashed in the Yavne area. As of now, no injuries have been reported, and no sirens were activated. The incident is under investigation,' the IDF spokesperson's office stated. Etti Avivi, who owned the penthouse, was relieved that no one was hurt and that her 14-year-old dog Humi was safe. 'A drone crashing into my balcony? I have a better chance of winning the lottery,' she joked. 'I was outside when I heard the crash and the loud boom. I never imagined it was my home. My first worry was about Humi, who was alone inside.' She added, 'I never imagined it would happen at my house when I heard the crash and the loud boom.' Neighbors playfully commented, 'Looks like Humi will now be classified as a victim of hostile actions.' 'I'm so relieved Humi is safe. He must have been in the living room. I heard the explosion like everyone else, but it wasn't until the calls started coming in that I realized it was my home. We're fortunate no one was hurt.'

Israeli MK proposes bill to replace ‘West Bank’ with ‘Judea and S...	This follows a similar bill in the US by Republican senator Tom Cotton that would ban the term 'West Bank' in favor of Judea and Samaria in official US documents. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli MK Simcha Rothman proposed a bill that would replace the term 'the West Bank' with 'Judea and Samaria' in legislation and official documents. This follows a similar bill in the US by Republican senator Tom Cotton that would ban the term 'West Bank' in favor of Judea and Samaria in official US documents. 'The West Bank' and 'Judea and Samaria' refer to the area West of the Jordan River that Israel conquered from Jordan during the 1967 war. The bill's preamble states, 'Judea and Samaria are integral parts of the historic homeland of the Jewish people. Some of the most pivotal events in our history took place in these regions.' 'In contrast, the term' West Bank,' which emerged during a period of foreign rule, reflects a colonialist viewpoint that overlooks the profound historical connection of the Jewish people to this land.' The preamble further states that the bill 'aims to regulate the use of the term 'Judea and Samaria' in Israeli law, replacing other terms that refer to the same geographic area. This shift is in line with the broader effort to strengthen Israel's connection to the region and uphold the historical rights of the Jewish people.' Senator Tom Cotton (R-AK) introduced a bill that would ban the term 'West Bank.' Instead, if the bill becomes a law, it would require all official US documents to use the historically accurate term 'Judea and Samaria.' The bill's full name is the Retiring the Egregious Confusion Over the Genuine Name of Israel's Zone of Influence by Necessitating Government of Judea and Samaria (RECOGNIZING Judea and Samaria) Act. 'The Jewish people's legal and historic rights to Judea and Samaria go back thousands of years. The US should stop using the politically charged term West Bank to refer to the biblical heartland of Israel,' Cotton added.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An Israeli source says Israel is carrying out indirect talks with Syrian rebels, Israel National News reported. The source said communication is occurring through the Druze community in Israel and Syria, the Kurdish population, intelligence organizations, and US officials. 'There is someone to speak to on the other side, and messages were passed,' the source said, indicating Israel will continue operations to eliminate weapons held by the Assad regime. The source says the United States fully approves Israel's indirect communication with Syrian rebels. Defense Minister Israel Katz has encouraged the IDF to capture more areas in the buffer zone close to Syria's border with Israel. According to TPS, Israeli security officials are recruiting prominent Israeli Druze leaders to assist in fostering connections with Syrian Druze communities. On Sunday, Maj.-Gen. Shlomi Bender, head of the Israeli army's Intelligence Directorate, met with Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of Israel's Druze community, according to Lt.-Col. Avichay Adraee, spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces in Arabic. 'The head of the Intelligence Directorate and His Eminence Sheikh Tarif discussed recent developments in Syria and their impact on the Druze community,' Adraee tweeted. The initiative follows instructions from Defense Minister Israel Katz, who directed the IDF on Sunday to establish contact with the Syrian Druze and other local communities. There are an estimated 700,000 to 800,000 Druze in Syria, primarily in the southwestern regions near Israel and Jordan. They make up about four percent of Syria's population. Israel's Druze community, numbering around 152,000, traces its ancestry to Jethro, the Biblical figure and father-in-law of Moses. Israeli Druze hold prominent positions in both public and military life, and the deep bond between Jewish and Druze soldiers is often referred to as the 'covenant of blood.' During Israel's War of Independence in 1948, the Druze living in the Galilee and Mount Carmel regions chose to align with the Jewish community. They decided to integrate into Israeli society and have since established themselves across all sectors of public life.

During Israel's War of Independence in 1948, the Druze living in the Galilee and Mount Carmel regions chose to align with the Jewish community. They decided to integrate into Israeli society and have since established themselves across all sectors of public life.

Omri Cohen, 19, also a fighter in the Shaked Battalion, from Ashdod. Twelve additional soldiers were wounded in the same incident—two of them seriously—a reservist from the battalion and a member of the Artillery Corps’ 'Sky Rider' unit, which uses UAVs to collect and provide intelligence. They were evacuated by helicopter to the hospital. Earlier on Monday, the IDF announced the deaths of four soldiers killed in Southern Lebanon despite the ceasefire currently in effect.

After losing Syria, Iran ponders next steps	Iran is also concerned about the effect that the successful Syrian revolution could have domestically. By Noah Michaeli, TPS The fall of Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria will force Iran to make significant shifts in its military doctrine, analysts told The Press Service of Israel. 'This is going to force the Iranians to make serious compromises in the long run, because they are now more exposed in the region and they are more exposed internationally, and also because of the weakening economic situation and the isolation of the regime,' Dr. Meir Javedanfar, an Iran lecturer at Reichman University, told TPS-IL. 'But in the short run the Iranian regime is going to stick to its guns, it’s going to continue with its militancy towards the State of Israel. But very difficult questions remain for the regime, especially regarding the nuclear program for which it’s going to have to make painful decisions in the near future,' Javedanfar explained. This is because Iran is 'enriching at levels that are close to levels required to make a nuclear bomb,' Javedanfar said. Furthermore, Iran is also concerned about the effect that the successful Syrian revolution could have domestically. 'The regime is worried about the fall of Assad setting a precedent for the people of Iran doing the same,' Javedanfar explained. 'If Syria turns into a democracy then that would be an even more cause of concern for the regime because it would show that in the Middle East you can overthrow an authoritarian regime and replace it with a democracy,'Javedanfar said. According to Ray Zimmt, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), the fall of Assad is part of an overall trend of Iran weakening, as Israel strikes it on its home territory and its proxies crumble one after the other. 'The Assad collapse is the last part of a series of very concerning developments for Iran, after losing Hamas in Gaza and witnessing devastating damage to Hezbollah and the recent Israeli attack on Iran,' Zimmt told TPS-IL. 'All of these developments have raised doubts about Iran’s ability to deter Israel,' he continued. Syria, however, was of particularly great strategic importance to Iran, due to its role as a bridge for delivering weapons and ammunition from Iran to Hezbollah. 'Now, after the collapse of Assad, Iran’s ability to maintain its influence in Syria and to use Syria to provide Hezbollah with weapons and rehabilitate it has been significantly jeopardized,' Zimmt continued. This is especially significant now, as Hezbollah is desperately trying to rehabilitate itself following the destruction of its leadership and much of its weapons capabilities at the hands of Israel. Iran’s Options These developments, however, do not mean that Iran won’t attempt to maintain its influence in Syria. 'We’ve seen reports even today that Iran has tried to establish communication links with rebels in Syria,' Zimmt said, but added that 'there’s no doubt that Iran won’t be capable — at least in the near future — to maintain supply lines in Syria.' 'They can try to find other ways to assist Hezbollah but it won’t be easy due to Israeli determination to stop all weapons deliveries from Iran, and due to the fact that most border corridors are now dominated by the rebels,' Zimmt continued. The Iranian policy vis a vis Israel, according to Zimmt, can be divided into four main pillars: Proxies, terrorism, missiles and drones, and nuclear. The first three, according to Zimmt, have been used heavily in the past year of war, but were not sufficient to deter Israel from acting against Iran and its proxies. This, according Zimmt, leaves the nuclear pillar as the only pillar left for Iran. 'There are more and more voices inside Iran calling to readapt the nuclear doctrine, saying it’s no longer sufficient to be satisfied with Iran’s position as a threshold state and that it should break out to nuclear,' Zimmt said. But with President-elect Donald Trump due to return to the White House, any Iranian nuclear breakout strategy is very risky for Tehran. 'Currently there is no good option for Iran,' Zimmt explained. 'It’s either to try to look for some sort of arrangement with the west concerning its nuclear program, or to go nuclear but take the risk of further escalation and even military confrontation with Israel.'

Paraguay to make history as sixth nation with Jerusalem embassy	Paraguay has long maintained deep ties with Israel, tracing back to when it voted in favor to establish the Jewish state at the UN in 1947. By Jewish Breaking News Paraguay is set to become the sixth country with an embassy in Jerusalem. In a highly anticipated ceremony this coming Wednesday, President Santiago Pena will demonstrate his nation’s unwavering support for Israel by restoring their diplomatic mission to its rightful place in the Jewish people’s eternal capital. The two-day diplomatic visit will kick off with Pena addressing the Knesset, where he’ll meet with Israel’s leadership including Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Herzog. On Thursday, he will inaugurate his country’s embassy in Har Hotzvim industrial park. Families of victims from the October 7 Hamas massacre are expected to be in attendance. Paraguay has long maintained deep ties with Israel, tracing back to when it voted in favor to establish the Jewish state at the UN in 1947. During his own presidential campaign, the South American leader expressed strong support for moving his embassy to Jerusalem. 'The State of Israel recognizes Jerusalem as its capital. The seat of the parliament is in Jerusalem, the president is in Jerusalem. So who are we to question where they establish their own capital?' Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, who recently inaugurated Israel’s embassy in Asunción, praised Paraguay’s steadfast support. 'About three months ago, I had the honor of inaugurating the Israeli embassy in Paraguay,' Ohana said in comments cited by Hebrew media. 'In a moving ceremony, we affixed the mezuzah from the house where Sivan Elkabetz and Naor Hasidim were murdered on October 7.' 'Paraguay’s president will inaugurate the embassy in Jerusalem. Shimon, Sivan’s father; Avi, Naor’s father; and Elhanan Danino—the father of Uri, who was kidnapped from the Nova party and was murdered—will attend,' he said. 'Avi and Elhanan joined me on my recent visit to Paraguay, and like me, they felt the president’s embracing and sympathetic attitude towards the State of Israel and support for its existential struggle.' While most countries still maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv, Paraguay’s courage in recognition paves the way for more countries to follow. Currently, only the United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Kosovo, and Papua New Guinea have embassies in Jerusalem.

Geert Wilders tours Samaria with regional council head	Wilders is scheduled to meet with President Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, Energy Minister Eli Cohen, Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana and other lawmakers. By JNS Geert Wilders, the head of the Party for Freedom, the Netherlands’ largest political faction and a member of the ruling coalition, visited Samaria on Monday morning at the invitation of the Samaria Regional Council. Council head Yossi Dagan said that Wilders, as part of his tour of the area, received a briefing at an observation point 'in the seam line area on the narrow ‘waist’ of the State of Israel, which illustrates the security importance of Samaria for the residents of the center of the country.' Dagan told the visiting political leader: 'There are only 70 kilometers [44 miles] from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River, with the hills of Samaria dominating the area, accounting for 55 kilometers, [or 34 miles, of those 70 kilometers].' Wilders responded by acknowledging that this is a 'very small area,' adding, 'Not everyone will understand this, but I do.' מנהיג המפלגה הגדולה בהולנד, חירט וילדרס, הגיע לביקור נדיר בישראל, אשר עורר סערה בהולנד, סביב ביקור ביו'ש והמפגש עם יוסי דגן ראש מועצת שומרון. קודם לפגישותיו עם ראש הממשלה ונשיא המדינה, אירח אותו דגן לתצפית על המותניים הצרות של המדינה. pic.twitter.com/y37TBS4UrQ &mdash; שיראל ללום נהיר (@shirellaloom) December 9, 2024 The Dutch politician arrived in the Jewish state on Sunday for a 36-hour visit. After he touched down at Ben-Gurion International Airport on Sunday night, Wilders met with Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology Gila Gamliel 'and other dear friends' in Tel Aviv, he said on social media. Wilders said he was 'proud and privileged' to return to Israel after more than seven years, 'meet their leaders and politicians and visit beautiful Judea and Samaria where I used to live for some time in the ’80s.' Later on Monday, Wilders is scheduled to meet with President Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, Energy Minister Eli Cohen, Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana and other lawmakers, according to the Dutch MP. Last month, Wilders said that he would be pursuing police action after his travel plans to Israel were leaked to the media, allegedly by Dutch civil servants, which reportedly led to the postponement of his visit. 'Today, I spoke with the Internal Investigations Department [of the Dutch police]. I will be filing a report because of the leak of my itinerary in Israel,' Wilders said. According to him, the NRC daily reported on the confidential plan 'shortly after our embassy in Israel was informed.' 'This endangers my safety, as well as that of my security guards. Totally unacceptable,' the Dutch leader concluded his statement. Wilders has lived under strict 24/7 police protection since 2004 after receiving death threats over his criticism of Islamic terrorists and extremists. NRC claimed that the meeting between Wilders and Dagan would run counter to the policies of Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp, a member of the junior coalition partner New Social Contract Party. He supports the creation of a Palestinian state in Judea, Samaria and Gaza. Veldkamp was scheduled to fly to Jerusalem for an official visit last month, but Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar canceled it due to the Dutch diplomat’s support for the International Criminal Court arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Wilders—a staunch supporter of Israel’s right to the entire Land of Israel from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea—resided in the Jewish state for two years during his youth and has reportedly visited the country more than 40 times. After he graduated from secondary school, he spent a year as a volunteer at Moshav Tomer in the Jordan Valley. In 2018, Wilders declared, 'The more Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria the better, for that land is Jewish—and Jordan is Palestine!' Following Wilders’s win in the 2023 Dutch general election, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority condemned him for saying Arabs should be offered the right to settle in Jordan and elect their government. Hamas, which the European Union has listed as a terrorist organization, accused him of making a 'fascist statement that violates international law,' and called on the United Nations to condemn his positions. 'Hamas complaining about international law,' Wilders mockingly responded in a post on X, ending with a clown emoji.

‘Not a Pretty Day’ – Trump envoy warns Hamas of consequences if I...	‘You heard what Trump said,’ says president-elect’s designated Middle East envoy, expressing optimism a deal will be brokered between Hamas and Israel before Trump enters office on January 20th. By World Israel News Staff President-elect Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East tasked with securing the release of the 100 Israeli hostages still held in captivity in the Gaza Strip warned the Hamas terror organization Monday it would face consequences if the captives are not released or a hostage deal secured by inauguration day on January 20th. Speaking during a bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi on Monday, businessman Steve Witkoff, whom Trump has tapped to serve as his special envoy to the Mideast following his inauguration next month, expressed optimism that a deal could be brokered between Israel and Hamas by the January 20th deadline, adding he was hoping and praying an agreement is reached. If a deal is not reached, however, and Hamas continues to hold the hostages captive, Witkoff warned of serious consequences for the Islamist terror group. 'You heard what the president said, they better be released,' Witkoff told Reuters. 'Listen to what the president has got to say. It's not a pretty day if they're not released.' Last week, Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that there would be 'hell to pay' if Hamas continues to hold the 100 remaining Israeli hostages past inauguration day. Earlier on Monday, the London-based, Qatari-owned Al Araby Al Jadeed outlet reported that major progress has been made towards a hostage deal, adding that Hamas has drafted a list of hostages to be released in a possible deal, and submitted the list to Egypt. The Israeli government downplayed the report, however, with the government coordinator for hostage talks issuing a statement to the captives’ families, calling the report 'not correct.' 'We continue to take all measures to secure the return of the hostages and take great care to keep this information secured. We urge you to continue to only rely on information coming from authorized sources.' the statement said.

Anti-Netanyahu vandal directed by Iranian agents, say police	Israeli man from Galilee arrested after torching car, spray painting graffiti against the Netanyahu government - all on behalf of the Iranian government. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli man living in the Galilee was arrested recently, on suspicion he was a paid agent of the Iranian government, authorities announced Monday morning. In a joint statement issued by the Shin Bet internal security agency and the Northern District Police, authorities announced that 33-year-old Israeli citizen Artyom Zolotarev, a resident of Nof HaGalil, was arrested in November on suspicion of carrying out security-related offenses on behalf of Iranian intelligence in exchange for thousands of dollars. The investigation revealed that Zolotarev engaged in activities such as spray-painting anti-government graffiti in Nof HaGalil, Haifa, and Migdal HaEmek, and setting a vehicle on fire in Haifa. These acts were allegedly coordinated and directed by an Iranian handler, referred to online as 'Eliad.' According to Shin Bet and police findings, Zolotarev was contacted by 'Eliad' via social media in October 2024. The handler offered him payment to spray anti-government graffiti with the purported aim of destabilizing Israeli society. Zolotarev carried out dozens of graffiti incidents, documented them through photos and videos, and sent the evidence to 'Eliad' before erasing the graffiti to avoid detection. In return, he was paid $2,800 in cryptocurrency. After refusing additional tasks, including photographing residential buildings, electrical transformers, and burning another vehicle, Zolotarev reportedly realized he was dealing with an Iranian intelligence operative. This realization followed his exposure to reports about other Israeli citizens who had been arrested for similar collaborations with Iranian agents. Despite his initial refusals, Zolotarev later agreed to set a car on fire in Haifa at the request of his handler, receiving $2,000 in cryptocurrency for the act. Subsequently, 'Eliad' introduced Zolotarev to another Iranian handler, 'Boaz Mar,' for whom he continued performing graffiti-related tasks and committed additional acts of arson. Zolotarev was offered $125,000 to carry out a murder, with promises of assistance to flee to Russia or Iran. He was also instructed to purchase a firearm for future use. He declined both offers. This morning, December 9, 2024, a severe indictment was filed against Zolotarev at the Nazareth District Court, charging him with offenses including contact with a foreign agent, arson, and vandalism.

Four IDF soldiers killed in Lebanon, bringing military death toll...	Israeli forces have killed some two dozen Hezbollah terrorists since the start of the Nov. 27 Israel-Lebanon ceasefire. By JNS Four Israel Defense Forces soldier were killed in Southern Lebanon despite the ceasefire currently in effect, the military announced on Monday. The slain troops were identified as Maj. (res.) Evgeny Zinershain, 43, from Zichron Ya’akov; Capt. (res.) Sagi Ya’akov Rubinshtein, 31, from Lavi; Master Sgt. (res.) Binyamin Destaw Negose, 28, from Beit Shemesh; and Sgt. Maj. (res.) Erez Ben Efraim, 25, from Ramat Gan. All four served in Battalion 9263 of the 226th Brigade, the IDF said. Israeli forces have killed some two dozen Hezbollah terrorists since the start of the Nov. 27 Israel-Lebanon ceasefire, the Israel Defense Forces announced on Sunday. The Israeli Air Force has also struck dozens of Hezbollah positions during the same period, the military stated. Under the terms of the truce, Israeli forces are to withdraw from Lebanon by late January, while Lebanon’s army enters those areas vacated by the IDF. Hezbollah has violated the ceasefire repeatedly since the day it took effect, according to the IDF. The IDF said on Sunday that forces of its 7th Armored Brigade, working under the command of the 98th Division, discovered weapons warehouses hidden in civilian areas of Southern Lebanon. In one operation, troops found 'hundreds' of anti-tank rockets, mortar grenades and a car with a rocket launcher mounted on top, the military said, adding that the forces also 'located and destroyed' several tunnel shafts that led to underground Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure. The Israel Defense Forces on Saturday night announced the death in Gaza of Cpt. Avraham Ben Pinchas, 24, a platoon commander in the 401st Armored Brigade’s 46th Battalion, from Harasha in Samaria. According to a preliminary probe, his tank was hit by a Hamas missile during a counter-terror operation in Rafah city. The death toll among Israeli troops since the start of the Gaza ground incursion on Oct. 27 currently stands at 381, and at 813 on all fronts since the Hamas-led massacre on Oct. 7, 2023, according to official IDF data. Additionally, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage-rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Fearing new hostile regime, Iran attempts to woo Syrian rebels	Tehran opens direct line of communication with Syria's new leadership - amid fears the Islamist-led rebels who toppled the pro-Iranian Assad regime could take a 'hostile trajectory' vis-a-vis Iran. By World Israel News Staff Tehran has opened a direct line of communication with Syrian rebel forces who seized control of the capital city of Damascus on Sunday, a senior Iranian official informed Reuters Monday, in an attempt to improve ties with insurgents Iran has hitherto sought to crush. Prior to the fall of Damascus and the collapse of the Assad regime, Iran had worked alongside Russia to bolster the Ba'athist government in Syria, providing not only weapons but also organizing militias to help combat rebel forces across the country. Now, however, Iran has made an about-face, the official said, and is attempting to achieve a rapprochement with its former enemies, including Sunni fundamentalists, who make up a large portion of the rebel forces. The rebel alliance which succeeded in overrunning Damascus was headed by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Sunni group formerly associated with Al Qaeda which has been accused in the past of targeted bombings against Shi'ite pilgrims in Syria. Iran is attempting, the official said, to 'prevent hostile trajectory' between Tehran and the new regime in Damascus. Despite their difficult mutual history, Iran's Foreign Ministry expressed optimism Sunday that relations between Iran and Syria could continue to be based on a 'far-sighted and wise approach,' even after the change in regime. Senior Iranian officials have yet to panic over the loss of their long-time ally, ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad, with three different Iranian officials saying their government is working to find elements within the new Syrian leadership 'whose views are closer to Iran's.' 'The main concern for Iran is whether Assad's successor will push Syria away from Tehran's orbit,' one Iranian official said. 'That is a scenario Iran is keen to avoid.'

‘Israel must reorganize presence on Golan Heights’	The Pereh unit will consist of highly trained reservists, described as reconnaissance and special unit members, who are locals. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS As part of its efforts to implement lessons drawn from Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of southern Israel, the Israel Defense Forces recently announced the establishment of a rapid-response reserve unit for the Golan Heights. These lessons remain relevant no matter whom Israel finds itself facing on the other side of the border in the wake of the Assad regime’s collapse. On Dec. 3, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit announced the inauguration of the Pereh (Hebrew for 'Wild') unit in the Golan Heights, which will operate under the Golan Division (formally known as the 210th 'Bashan' Formation). The new unit was established as part of the process of improving the operational response in the Golan Heights, with an emphasis on creating a division-level force multiplier. The unit will consist of highly trained reservists, described as reconnaissance and special unit members who are locals. Brig. Gen. Yair Palai, commander of the 210th Formation, said the Pereh Unit was born out of a need for the Golan Heights to grow stronger and deal with any challenge. The unit’s commander, identified only as Lt. Col. (res.) Y., added that enlisted personnel joined the unit over the past three months. Brig. Gen. (res.) Yossi Kuperwasser, a senior research fellow at Misgav Institute for National Security, and former head of the Research and Assessment Division of the IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate, told JNS on Dec. 7 that 'the logic standing behind the establishment of the Pereh Unit is to enable significant improvement of the area defense in the Golan Heights, on the basis of quality reserve personnel residing in the region, and this under the area division [Division 210].' According to Kuperwasser, 'This is part of the drawing of lessons from the October 7 attack, during which there was a significant shortage of skilled fighters mainly in the first hours, and the transition from routine to emergency was very problematic.' Kuperwasser added, 'The latest developments in Syria sharpen even more so the importance of the establishment of the unit, because they teach how much the aspects of the threat can change rapidly. It seems as if there is a need to set up similar units along the other borders, as part of the needed change in the security concept, and for improving the defense component.' Thwart every threat On Dec. 6, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit stated that in light of an assessment of the situation that has been taking place since the previous day at the General Staff and in the Northern Command, and 'in light of the developments in the internal fighting in Syria, it was decided on reinforcement of air and ground forces in the Golan Heights sector. 'IDF forces are deployed in the border area and have increased readiness according to the various scenarios,' the military said. The army vowed that it would 'not allow a threat close to Israel’s border, and would act to thwart every threat on the citizens of the State of Israel.' Lt. Col. (res.) Doron Avital, a former commander of the elite General Staff Reconnaissance Unit (Sayeret Matkal), told JNS on Dec. 6 that changes in Syria demanded new organizational responses. 'In light of the developments in the north—the civil war in Syria—it is clear that one must organize in a different and more effective way along the Golan Heights line,' Avital said. He assessed that 'the Lebanon and Syria arenas are interwoven together—here, the weakening of Hezbollah is immediately translated into strengthening of the rebels [in Syria] and the axis opposing Iran.' According to Avital, 'In light of this, to build forces and units that have intimate regional familiarity—topographical landscape—regional familiarity with the enemy—is a good idea,' adding that the Golan Division’s Alpinist Unit along the Hermon line and Mount Dov operate on this basis, and that a unit should do the same within the greater Golan Heights area. Last month, the IDF confirmed that it is constructing new fortifications on the Golan Heights, on the border with Syria. According to the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit, Israel has been 'working to establish a barrier on Israeli territory exclusively to thwart a possible terrorist invasion and protect the security of Israel’s borders.' The most disturbing scenario involves a surprise attack by Iranian-backed Shi’ite terrorist militias on Israeli communities and IDF bases in the Israeli Golan Heights, similar to the Oct. 7, 2023, assault and to what Hezbollah had planned to do in the Galilee from Lebanon. Thousands of enemy operatives could attempt to infiltrate Israeli territory using fast vehicles, breach the border and kill civilians.

Israel reaching out to Syrian Druze communities	An estimated 700,000-800,000 Druze live in Syria, mostly in southwestern areas near Israel and Jordan. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Israeli security officials are enlisting senior Israeli Druze figures to help build bridges with Syrian Druze communities. The head of the Israeli army’s Intelligence Directorate, Maj.-Gen. Shlomi Bender, met with Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of Israel’s Druze community on Sunday, according to Lt.- Col. Avichay Adraee, the Israel Defense Force’s Arabic spokesperson. 'The head of the Intelligence Service and His Eminence Sheikh Tarif discussed the developments in the scene in Syria and their effects on the Druze community,' Adraee tweeted. The move came as Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the IDF to establish contact with the Syrian Druze and other communities on Sunday. An estimated 700,000-800,000 Druze live in Syria, mostly in southwestern areas near Israel and Jordan. They make up around four percent of the Syrian population. Israel’s Druze community of 152,000 trace their ancestry back to the Biblical figure Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses. Israeli Druze serve in senior positions in public and military life, and the bond between Jewish and Druze soldiers is referred to as the 'covenant of blood.' The Druze speak Arabic but are not Muslim and are very secretive about their religious beliefs. The Druze living in the Galilee and Mount Carmel areas sided with the Jews in 1948 during Israel’s War of Independence, opted to be part of Israeli society and established themselves in all areas of public life. When Israel captured the Golan Heights during the Six-Day War of 1967, the Golan Druze refused Israeli offers of citizenship, believing Syria would recapture the plateau. But attitudes have changed since the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2011. Katz also ordered the army to prevent Iran and Hezbollah from renewing arms smuggling routes between Syria and Lebanon and to destroy strategic weapons that could fall into rebel hands. Israel took control of the 235 sq km buffer zone –including the Syrian side of Mt. Hermon, a strategic peak in the Golan Heights — to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border as the regime of Bashar Assad collapsed on Sunday. The move into the demilitarized zone was coordinated with peacekeepers from the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, which has been monitoring an Israeli-Syrian ceasefire since 1974. The Israeli Air Force struck military airfields, weapons depots and munitions factories across southern Syria and around Damascus to prevent them from falling into rebel hands. Targets included the Mezzeh and Khalkalah military airports in the Damascus area, which were used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and Hezbollah. The strikes also reportedly destroyed facilities producing chemical weapons and precision missiles.

The Qatar Foundation’s hidden hand, from Hamas to US universities	An ISGAP report labeled Qatar as the largest foreign donor to US universities. By TPS As Qatar resumed mediating an Israel-Hamas hostage deal, the Gulf state has also been using its economic power to support Hamas terror and spread propaganda on North American campuses. One key figure in this effort is Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, the mother of current Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. 'She is a fashion icon and a philanthropist, but she is openly pro-Hamas,' Asaf Romirowsky, historian and executive director of Scholars for Peace in the Middle East community, told The Press Service of Israel. Through the Qatar Foundation, which Moza heads, Qatari money is flooding American schools and universities to indoctrinate American students. A 2022 study by the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) argued that as funding from Middle Eastern countries increases and becomes less transparent, campuses experience an 'erosion of democratic values.' Another ISGAP report labeled Qatar as the largest foreign donor to US universities. 'Our investigations during the Trump administration revealed that many of the US most prestigious universities are shockingly agnostic about who they’ll take money from,' Paul R. Moore, former chief investigative counsel in the US Department of Education, told TPS-IL. 'The purposes of these donors are often very much contrary to the US national interests. The failure of many of the universities to respond to antisemitic protests is a perfect example. The universities didn’t want to offend their Middle Eastern donors.' Romirowsky and Moore agreed that President-elect Donald Trump will demand greater transparency from universities about their foreign funding. 'Qatar money is tunneling anti-American values into America, buying hearts and minds. This needs to be changed,' Romirowsky said. Added Moore, 'I fully expect that the incoming Trump administration will quickly reverse the current administration’s negligence of its enforcement obligations. Civil investigations are very likely to occur with universities that have failed to be in compliance.' After Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in October, Moza eulogized the mastermind of the October 7 attacks. 'The name Yahya means the one who lives. They thought he was dead but he lives. He will live on and they [Israel] will be gone,' she tweeted. In a recent article in the Jewish Journal, Moza was called a matriarch of the royal family, 'heavily involved in the dispersing of funds,' according to Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president of research for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). According to the FDD, Qatar has given an estimated $1.8 billion to Gaza’s Hamas-run government since 2007, with reports indicating that around 80 percent of that money was paid as salaries to Hamas terrorists and leaders.

‘State of Optimism’ – Hamas drafts list of living captives to be ...	Hostage deal talks are making progress and have moved to 'advanced stage,' report claims, to the point where Hamas has handed over a list of captives to be released in a possible deal - and a list of jailed terrorists it is demanding be freed in exchange. By World Israel News Staff Hostage deal talks have made significant process recently, reaching an 'advanced stage,' according to a report Monday by the London-based, Qatari-owned news outlet Al Araby Al Jadeed. Citing a source familiar with the issue, the report claimed that talks between Hamas and Israel, brokered by Qatar and Egypt, have reached a point where the two sides are now discussing the individuals who will be released in a possible deal. Hamas reportedly has drafted a tentative list of living hostages who could be released in an agreement, including information on their condition. The deal now under consideration would include the release of elderly captives and female captives, along with others whose health is in serious condition. The hostages listed for release in the deal include four with American citizenship, despite not fitting the demographic criteria. The terror group has transmitted the list to Egyptian brokers, who according to Monday's report, are in a 'state of optimism' regarding the prospects for a deal by the January 20th deadline laid out by President-elect Donald Trump. Hamas has also drafted a list of jailed Arab terrorists it wants released from Israeli prisons in exchange for the freeing of Israeli captives. According to the report, Hamas has agreed to a tw0-month 'transitional' phase, during which there will be expanded entry of aid into the Gaza Strip. 'Both sides are serious about reaching an unprecedented deal, with Egypt, Qatar, and the US participating in the negotiations as mediators,' the source cited by Monday's report said.

Drone from Yemen hits building in central Israel	The mayor of Yavne, Roei Gabay, told the Ynet outlet that nobody was home when the drone hit the balcony of an apartment on the top floor. By JNS A blast that occurred in a residential high-rise building in the central Israeli city of Yavne on Monday morning was caused by a drone launched from Yemen, according to the Israel Defense Forces. 'Following initial reports, an unmanned aerial vehicle that apparently crossed [into Israeli territory] from Yemen was detected in the area of ​​the city of Yavne,' the IDF stated. The military is investigating why no sirens were triggered by the attack. There were no immediate reports of casualties, with Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency medical response group saying paramedics were still carrying out searches in the 15-story building. The mayor of Yavne, Roei Gabay, told the Ynet outlet that nobody was home when the drone hit the balcony of an apartment on the top floor.

Israeli defense minister consolidates IDF control over Syrian Gol...	Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar insists IDF's new security zone on Syrian side of the Golan Heights is 'limited, temporary,' and intended only to prevent incursions from the Syrian side. By World Israel News Staff Israel's military has been ordered to establish a security zone on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, consolidating Israeli control over the area, after rebels - led by an Islamist faction - seized control of the government over the weekend. According to Hebrew media reports Monday, Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) has instructed the IDF to deepen Israeli control over the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, after Israeli tanks and soldiers moved into the strategic area Sunday morning. Shortly after rebel forces, led by the radical Islamist Tahrir al-Sham movement, captured Damascus and forced President Bashar Assad to flee, Israeli forces crossed the demarcation line separating the Israeli and Syrian sides of the Golan Heights, taking control of the buffer zone established after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Israel directly controls 500 square miles of the strategic plateau it captured in 1967, which the Knesset annexed in 1981 - a move which decades later was recognized by the United States. Syria has controlled the remaining 200 square miles since a series of separation of forces agreements after the 1973 war, with 91 square miles included in a demilitarized zone, where no military forces were permitted, and a United Nations observer force was deployed. On Sunday, Israeli forces were deployed to the demilitarized zone, and additionally seized control of parts of the Syrian Golan outside of the DMZ, including the Syrian side of Mount Hermon. Katz reportedly ordered all areas of the Syrian Golan Heights placed under Israeli control to be turned into a security zone, which IDF forces would ensure will remain free of hostile forces, terrorist infrastructure, and Iranian weapons smuggling. Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa'ar (New Hope) said at a press conference Monday that Israel's presence in the Syrian Golan is 'limited' and 'temporary.' 'The only interest we have is the security of Israel,' Sa'ar emphasized.

Senior UNRWA school staff were Hamas terrorists – Report	At least 24 teachers and administrators at UNRWA schools named as armed fighters in Hamas internal documents. By World Israel News Staff Dozens of staff at UNRWA schools in the Gaza Strip were active members of Hamas' military wings, and were named as combatants on internal documents and issued weapons by the terror group, according to a New York Times report. Israeli forces seized numerous documents from Hamas offices in the Strip which clearly indicated that at least 24 administrators and teachers on UNRWA's payroll were Hamas operatives. Several Gazans, speaking anonymously, confirmed to the Times that it was widely known that many UNRWA staff were affiliated with Hamas or active members of the terror group. One teacher was often seen dressed in Hamas' fatigues after leaving his post at an UNRWA school. A quick glance at the social media profiles of many of those named on the lists shows open support for Hamas, including posts of the terror groups' banners. In 2017, a tunnel used by the Hamas terror group was located inside of an UNRWA school. Khaled al-Masri, the principal of the school, is a Hamas operative who was given a handgun and assault rifle by the terror group, according to the Times report. But despite extensive evidence of Hamas infiltrating UNRWA schools, the U.N. agency has not taken steps to expel terrorists from its payroll. 'The U.N. has been unable and or unwilling to eliminate Hamas militants and their supporters, as well as those from other terrorist groups, from their ranks,' James Lindsay, who served as UNRWA's general counsel until 2007, told the Times. 'UNRWA hiring practices and the makeup of the labor pool from which UNRWA draws its employees suggests to me that the numbers the Israelis are talking about are probably pretty close to the truth.' In a laconic statement, UNRWA commissioner general Philippe Lazzarini claimed that the organization does not have the resources to conduct thorough background checks on its employees. He also sniped that it was 'extraordinarily interesting' that Israel shared the documents with the press, rather than UNRWA. Lazzrini did not acknowledge that UNRWA has consistently rejected evidence of terror within the organization, when presented with that information by Israel. After being shown footage of UNRWA employees throwing a murdered Israeli's corpse into a vehicle during the October 7th terror onslaught, the organization only managed to say that some of its staff 'may' have been involved with Hamas. 'The U.N. seems intent on portraying this problem as a few bad apples, rather than acknowledging that the tree is rotten,' said Amir Weissbrod, Israel's foreign ministry’s deputy director for international organizations, told the Times. Hamas spokesman Basem Naim declined to comment on the report.

Families of Israelis missing in Syria hopeful after Assad’s downf...	I have not forgotten him for a moment and it has been almost 60 years since he was hanged,' says Eli Cohen's widow, Nadia. By World Israel News Staff The families of four Israeli citizens kidnapped or executed by Syria are hopeful that the end of the Assad regime will lead to new information regarding their loved ones' whereabouts. Mossad spy Eli Cohen was executed in Syria in 1967, and his body was buried in a secret location. His widow, Nadia, has fought tirelessly for decades in attempt to find his grave and rebury him in Israel. 'I don't want them to leave Eli's body in Syria,' she told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'The upheavals that are taking place there can be for our benefit. I wish both the Syrian people and us peace, and I want [to use] this opportunity to return Eli's body to Israel so that he can rest in peace. I will rest too after all these years,' she added. 'I have not forgotten him for a moment and it has been almost 60 years since he was hanged.' Following the Battle of Sultan Yacoub in 1982, five Israeli soldiers were declared missing in action. The battle took place in southern Lebanon, near the border with Syria, and saw fierce fighting between the IDF and the Syrian army. Out of those five soldiers, two were freed in a prisoner exchange, while another's remains were repatriated to Israel in 2019. IF soldiers Yehuda Katz and Zvika Feldman remain missing. Their families have noted that people held in secret Syrian prisons for decades have been released by rebel groups in recent days, and have raised the possibility that Katz and Feldman have been incarcerated for more than 40 years. 'What is happening now in Syria is a rare window of opportunity that we very much hope will bring Zvika home,' Feldman's sister Anat told Ynet. 'We have no idea what happened to him, but the regime of Assad and his father was very cruel, and [Zvika] may have been held in some dungeon somewhere.' Another Israeli soldier, Guy Hever, disappeared in the Golan Heights in 1997. His family immediately suspected he was captured by Syrian forces, but no evidence of his fate has ever been found.

Trump says Gaza war must end, but with Israel’s victory	Trump said that he thought fewer hostages are alive 'than many people think.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, President-elect Donald Trump said the war in Gaza must end, but Israel must be victorious. Responding to the question of whether he would put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war in Gaza, he indicated that he would, but he added, 'I want him to end it, but you have to have a victory.' Trump said that he thought fewer hostages are alive 'than many people think.' Speaking of one hostage who was pulled by her hair and seen bloodied, he said 'I don't think you have as many. I mean, I hate to say it, I think you have far fewer hostages than people think.' Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan, a hostage in Gaza, was seen in a Hamas propaganda video earlier in the week, in September said she believed that only 30 to 35 of the 110 remaining hostages are alive after Netanyahu put the number at 50. Trump was critical of people who minimized or denied the October 7th massacre and referred to them as 'October 7th deniers.' He explained, 'People forget about October 7th. That was as violent — and you know what's happening? I noticed that a lot of people are saying, 'Oh, it never really happened.' That's like the Holocaust.' Trump added, 'You know, you have Holocaust deniers. Now you have October 7th deniers, and it just happened. No, October 7th happened.' He concluded, 'No, October 7th happened. And I've seen the pictures. It is — what happened is horrible.' When asked what he thought Trump as president would do to bring about the end of the Gaza war, Jewish author and broadcaster Mark Levin told Arutz Sheva that 'Trump wants peace but he will protect Israel.' Levin said, 'I predict that he will give the Israeli government whatever they need to end the war quickly. He would like peace, but he will protect Israel. It will be a fantastic opportunity for the Israeli government.' The broadcaster revealed that after he sent Trump a congratulations message, Trump texted back, saying, 'Thank you, and by the way, Mark, I will protect Israel.' Last week, Trump threatened there would be 'hell to pay' if the hostages in Gaza aren't released by the time he takes office on January 20th.

Dozens of Hezbollah terrorists have been eliminated since start o...	The Israeli Air Force has also struck dozens of Hezbollah positions during the same period, the military stated. By JNS Israeli forces have killed some two dozen Hezbollah terrorists since the start of the Nov. 27 Israel-Lebanon ceasefire, the Israel Defense Forces announced on Sunday. The Israeli Air Force has also struck dozens of Hezbollah positions during the same period, the military stated. Under the terms of the truce, Israeli forces are to withdraw from Lebanon by late January, while Lebanon’s army enters those areas vacated by the IDF. Hezbollah has violated the ceasefire repeatedly since the day it took effect, according to the IDF. The IDF said on Sunday that forces of its 7th Armored Brigade, working under the command of the 98th Division, discovered weapons warehouses hidden in civilian areas of Southern Lebanon. In one operation, troops found 'hundreds' of anti-tank rockets, mortar grenades and a car with a rocket launcher mounted on top, the military said, adding that the forces also 'located and destroyed' several tunnel shafts that led to underground Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure. On Sunday morning, Lebanon’s Al Mayadeen news outlet, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported that two people were killed in an Israel drone strike on a structure in Southern Lebanon. On Saturday night, the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese daily Al Akhbar claimed that four people had been killed and six others wounded by an Israeli strike in Beit Lif in the country’s south. In addition, the IDF has attacked Hezbollah convoys fleeing Syria for Lebanon following the collapse of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s rule. IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Sky News Arabia on Dec. 2 that Jerusalem remains committed to the terms of the ceasefire. 'UNIFIL forces and the Lebanese government must fulfill their roles—this is also in their interest. We need this period to ensure there are no terror bases there,' he said, emphasizing that the Lebanese people and government must ensure that 'Beirut and Southern Lebanon are free of weapons—not in homes, not in yards and not in children’s rooms.' There have been few gunfights involving Israeli ground forces since the ceasefire took effect, though Hezbollah launched two mortar shells across the border on the sixth day of the truce. IAF fighter jets struck launch pads in response. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed after the mortar attacks to continue to 'respond to any violation by Hezbollah—minor or serious.'

Israel forces conquer Syrian side of Mount Hermon	This is the first time Israel's military has established a presence in the area since the end of the Yom Kippur War in 1973. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Sunday, the IDF conquered the Syrian side of Mount Hermon, the first time Israel's military has established a presence in the area since 1973. Mount Hermon was abandoned by the army of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad following his ouster. The forces that captured the area were members of the IAF's Shaldag Unit. The IDF has decided to establish a closed military zone in agricultural areas between Merom Golan-Ein Zivan and Buq'ata-Khirbat Ein Hura, based on a situational assessment. In 1974, an agreement to stop attrition warfare following the Yom Kippur War delineated a buffer zone between the border of Israel and Syria that was supposed to have been guarded by the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF). Absent such a force, Defense Minister Israel Katz deployed Israeli troops to Mount Hermon to ensure the safety of Israel’s Golan Heights. Speaking at Israel’s border with Syria on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the end of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad’s 14-year-old regime a 'milestone' for Israel and credited Israeli strikes against Iran and Hezbollah for the development. Addressing security concerns, Netanyahu said Israeli forces have been deployed to the buffer zone to protect Israeli communities on the border. He said, 'We will not allow any hostile force to establish itself on our border.' Netanyahu called Assad’s ouster a 'historic day for the Middle East,' citing Syria’s pivotal role in Iran’s network. He said, 'The Assad regime is a central link in Iran’s axis of evil – this regime has fallen. This is a direct result of the blows we inflicted on Iran and Hezbollah, the main supporters of the Assad regime.' Netanyahu continued, 'This has created a chain reaction throughout the Middle East of all those who want to be free from this oppressive and tyrannical regime.' However, the premier added that the development, while welcome for Israel, is 'not without risks,' and Israeli forces are needed to fill the buffer zone to safeguard Israeli communities. 'But it is also not without risks. First and foremost, we are working to protect our border. This area has been controlled for nearly 50 years by a buffer zone agreed upon in 1974, the Separation of Forces Agreement. This agreement collapsed,' he said.

Assad ‘peacefully’ left Syria, Russia claims, amid rumors of his ...	Russian government claims deposed Syrian president negotiated transfer of power with rebels before departing, while Syrian army officers suggest Assad may have died in a plane crash. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff There are conflicting reports Sunday regarding the fate and whereabouts of the deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad, hours after rebel forces seized control of the capital city, Damascus, toppling the Ba'athist regime. Two Syrian army officers were quoted by Reuters as saying that Assad had fled Damascus by plane just as the rebels overran regime defenses in the capital. The plane reportedly headed for the coast, towards areas populated primarily by members of the Alawite sect of Shi'ite Islam, where support for Assad is strongest. At some point, however, radar tracking of the aircraft showed it making a sudden U-turn west of the city of Homs, before suddenly descending rapidly in altitude and disappearing from radar, suggesting the plane may have crashed. The incident has fueled rumors that Assad may have been killed shortly after being ousted from power. However, later on Sunday, Russia's Foreign Ministry released a statement suggesting that Assad was alive and well after having left the country. The Kremlin also claimed that shortly before his departure, Assad had negotiated the peaceful transfer of power to rebel forces. 'We are following the dramatic events in Syria with extreme concern,' the Russian Foreign Ministry said. 'As a result of negotiations between Assad and a number of participants in the armed conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, he decided to leave the presidential post and left the country, giving instructions to transfer power peacefully.' 'Russia did not participate in these negotiations. At the same time, we appeal to all parties involved with a strong call to renounce the use of violence and resolve all governance issues by political means.' Moscow said it is working with 'all' rebel forces to stabilize the political situation in Syria. In this regard, the Russian Federation is in contact with all groups of the Syrian opposition. We call for respect for the opinions of all ethno-confessional forces of Syrian society, and support efforts to establish an inclusive political process based on the unanimously adopted UN Security Council Resolution 2254.' 'Russian military bases in Syria are on high alert. There is currently no serious threat to their security.

Saudi prince accuses Israel of ‘genocide’, calls for Netanyahu’s ...	Senior member of the Saudi royal family, who led the kingdom's intelligence agency for over 20 years, backs International Criminal Court's effort to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. By World Israel News Staff A prominent member of the Saudi royal family accused Israel of genocide over the weekend, and expressed hope that the International Criminal Court would succeed in securing the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Turki al Faisal, son of the late King Faisal, spoke at the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain Saturday, urging President-elect Donald Trump to bring peace to the Middle East. 'Friendly countries in the region are hoping that Mr. Trump pursues what he started before, to bring peace with capital letters to the Middle East,' al Faisal said. 'It is time for America, under your presidency, to change the course of this troubled region.' But al Faisal, who served as director-general of Saudi Arabia’s General Intelligence Presidency – the country’s central intel agency for 22 years before stepping down after 9/11 – also took aim at Israel, accusing the Jewish state of genocide and apartheid, and appearing to endorse the International Criminal Court’s efforts to secure the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'Israel today, according to international human rights groups, is not only an apartheid colonial state, but it is also a genocidal one,' al Faisal said. 'It is committing genocide on the people of Gaza.' 'It's about time for the world to&#8230; take the necessary steps to bring those who are charged by the International Criminal Court to justice.' Riyadh, which had mulled normalizing relations with Israel prior to the Hamas invasion of October 7th, has voiced increasingly harsh rhetoric towards Israel and its war against the Islamist terror group. In November, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the oil-rich kingdom's de facto ruler, accused Israel of genocide at an Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit hosted by Riyadh. During the summit, bin Salman said his kingdom condemned the 'genocide committed by Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people, which has claimed the lives of 150,000 martyrs, wounded and missing, most of whom are women and children.' 'We affirm that Israel’s continued crimes against innocent people,' bin Salman continued.

US Supreme Court to rule on $655 million terror lawsuit against P...	A federal appeals court had thrown out a $655 million judgment against the Palestinian Authority saying the US lacked jurisdiction. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Supreme Court accepted a case Friday that will decide if the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its main backer that represents it abroad, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), can be sued in the U.S. for terror acts committed in Israel against American citizens. The hearing will be held in the spring, with a judgment probably rendered around June 2025. In the original 2015 case, families of terror victims in Israel won $218.5 million in damages for six attacks that took place between 2002-2004, proving that the PA and PLO were materially involved in or incited their execution. A longstanding anti-terror law meant that the amount was automatically tripled to $655.5 million. While the district court judge had found that his court had jurisdiction over the defendants, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected this decision the next year. The higher court said that the PA and PLO did not have sufficient contacts with the U.S. to be sued there for terrorist acts committed in Israel. To correct that gap, in 2019 Congress passed the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA). This declared that both the PA and PLO are 'deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction' in any civil case brought under the 1992 Anti-Terror law, as long as either group was active in the U.S. and paid the terrorists, or their families if they were dead, at any point after 2019. The PA has been compensating such terrorists and their families for many years, on a sliding scale depending on how heinous were their acts, in what is known as the Palestinians’ 'pay for slay' official policy. When Congress passed a law in 2014 to defund the PA if it continued the program, the PA simply changed the name of the office funneling the payments to the 'PLO Commission of Prisoners Affairs.' In 2022, a federal judge ruled that the PSJVTA was unconstitutional because Congress 'cannot simply declare anything it wants to be [considered] consent,' agreeing with the PA and PLO that the law was improperly forcing them to agree to be sued, thus violating their due process rights. The Supreme Court will be hearing two cases together, that of Fuld vs. Palestine Liberation Organization and United States vs. Palestine Liberation Organization. Ari Fuld was an American citizen and prominent pro-Israel activist murdered by a Palestinian terrorist in the Gush Etzion shopping mall in 2018, and his family and others brought the lawsuit under his name. The Biden administration also requested the highest court’s intervention, saying that the lower court’s actions had undercut Congress’ decision that the PSJVTA was 'an important measure to further U.S. interests and protect and compensate U.S. nationals.' A lawyer representing families in the case, Kent Yalowitz, said in response to the news, 'We're encouraged by the court's acceptance of the case for review, and our families are looking forward to restoration of the judgment in their favor and a long-overdue measure of justice for the horrific attacks against them.'

IAEA: Iran ‘dramatically’ accelerates uranium enrichment	This development was 'very worrisome,' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi was quoted as saying. By Natan Galula, JNS Iran has in recent weeks sharply increased its uranium enrichment efforts, according to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi. 'Today the agency is announcing that the production capacity is increasing dramatically, of the 60% inventory,' said Grossi at the Manama Dialogue security conference in Bahrain, according to Reuters. The Islamic Republic already has enough 60% enriched uranium for four nuclear weapons in principle, should Tehran decide to enrich it further to the roughly 90% level, according to the agency. Enrichment levels were set to rise to 'seven, eight times more, maybe, or even more' than the previous rate of five to seven kilograms a month, said Grossi, according to the report. IAEA inspectors had detected the increased enrichment activities at Iran’s Fordow nuclear plant south of Tehran, he told the BBC. 'The facility’s updated design information showed that the effect of this change would be to significantly increase the rate of production of UF6 [uranium] enriched up to 60%,' an IAEA report read, per the BBC. This development was 'very worrisome,' Grossi was quoted as saying. Despite Iran denying it is pursuing nuclear weapons, a Western diplomatic source told Reuters that Tehran’s nuclear project was 'extremely serious' and had no civilian justification. 'These measures have no credible civilian justification and could, on the contrary, directly fuel a military nuclear program if Iran were to take the decision … They are in contradiction with Iran’s declarations on its willingness to return to credible negotiations,' the source was quoted as saying. Last week, Britain, France and Germany agreed to continue nuclear negotiations with Tehran following a meeting in Geneva and amid threats by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to reinstitute a 'maximum pressure' campaign on the Islamic Republic once he assumes office in January. Iran’s top nuclear negotiator Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi met on Nov. 29 with top diplomats from the European nations, known collectively as the E3. The talks came after the European countries joined the United States to have Iran censured by the IAEA or its lack of cooperation. The resolution by the agency’s 35-nation Board of Governors notes an 'essential and urgent' need for Iran to provide 'technically credible explanations' for the uranium traces at undeclared facilities. It also urges the IAEA to compile 'a comprehensive and updated assessment on the possible presence or use of undeclared nuclear material in connection with past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran’s nuclear program.' Iran condemned the censure as 'politically motivated' and announced the launch of 'new advanced centrifuges' to produce additional enriched uranium.

By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon A federal appeals court denied TikTok’s request to overturn an April law requiring the social media platform to sever ties with its China-based parent company or face a ban in the United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled Friday TikTok must divest from CCP-controlled ByteDance by Jan. 19 or the popular social media app will lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the United States. 'The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,' Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion. 'Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.' Lawmakers and national security officials have long warned about TikTok's ties to China, saying the app is a national security threat and subjects the data from its roughly 170 million American users to Chinese surveillance. Chinese national security laws require organizations, like TikTok, to cooperate with intelligence gathering. TikTok and ByteDance, however, challenged the legislation against it in May, calling the law 'an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power' based on 'speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation' that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.

‘Assad is gone’ – Trump reacts to fall of Damascus	President-elect Donald Trump says rebels managed to overthrow Assad due to Russia abandoning Syrian government, attributes shift to Ukraine war and 'Israel's fighting success.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President and President-elect Donald Trump reacted Sunday to the fall of Damascus and the collapse of the Assad regime, claiming that the Russian military had abandoned the Syrian government, leading to a series of lighting fast victories by rebel forces over the course of just over a week. Taking to the Truth Social media outlet Sunday morning, Trump suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin had withdrawn support from Assad. 'Assad is gone,' Trump wrote. 'He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer. There was no reason for Russia to be there in the first place.' Trump argued that the strain on Russia of the nearly three years of fighting against Ukraine, coupled with the relative weakness of Iran and its proxies following Israel's 'fighting success' had left Moscow unwilling or unable to prop up the Ba'athist regime in Damascus any longer. 'They lost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine, where close to 600,000 Russian soldiers lay wounded or dead, in a war that should never have started, and could go on forever.' 'Russia and Iran are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success.' The incoming president suggested that the collapse of the Assad regime, signaling Russia's weakness, marked an opportunity for Kyiv and Moscow to end the ongoing conflict. 'Likewise, Zelenskyy and Ukraine would like to make a deal and stop the madness. They have ridiculously lost 400,000 soldiers, and many more civilians.' 'There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed, and if it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse. I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act. China can help. The World is waiting!' In a tweet on Saturday, prior to the rebel takeover of Damascus, Trump said the U.S. 'should have nothing to do with it,' regarding the Syrian civil war. 'This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved!'

Feds use bank loophole to surveil Americans’ financial data witho...	The Friday report has shed 'new light on the decaying state of Americans’ financial privacy and the federal government’s widespread, warrantless surveillance programs,' the committee said. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Federal law enforcement exploited the Suspicious Activity Report system to access and surveil Americans’ private financial data without warrants or probable cause, according to a report from the House Judiciary Committee. The FBI 'manipulated' the SAR filing process by pressuring banks to file reports on individuals the FBI deems 'suspicious,' making financial institutions 'de facto arms of law enforcement,' the interim report released Friday said. SARs do not require any legal process, granting officials 'virtually unchecked access' to 'confidential and highly sensitive information.' The Republican-led oversight committee accused the FBI of circumventing the Bank Secrecy Act, which specifies that it is a bank’s responsibility to file a SAR when it identifies a 'suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation.' The Friday report has shed 'new light on the decaying state of Americans’ financial privacy and the federal government’s widespread, warrantless surveillance programs,' the committee said. 'Documents show that federal law enforcement increasingly works hand-in-glove with financial institutions, obtaining virtually unchecked access to private financial data and testing out new methods and new technology to continue the financial surveillance of American citizens,' the report reads. The committee first launched its investigation last summer after a whistleblower revealed that, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, Bank of America 'voluntarily and without legal process' turned over to the the FBI a list of individuals who used its credit or debit cards in the Washington, D.C., area during that period, Fox News reported. After the Capitol riot, the FBI, coordinating with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, 'encourag[ed] financial institutions across the country to scour their data and file SARs on hundreds of Americans, if not more, without any clear criminal nexus,' according to the House report. The House committee said that 'all Americans should be disturbed by how their financial data is collected, made accessible to, and searched by federal and state officials, including law enforcement and regulatory agencies,' warning that 'the future leaves very little financial activity beyond the purview of modern financial institutions or the government’s prying eyes.'

Israeli forces seize Golan buffer zone, bomb chemical weapons pla...	IDF on high alert in the Golan Heights, entering demilitarized zone and warning rebel forces not to approach Israeli frontier. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli forces entered the demilitarized zone in the Golan Heights early Sunday morning, taking up positions along the Syrian frontier immediately following the capture of Damascus by rebel forces, an IDF spokesperson said. The Israeli military announced Sunday morning that IDF infantry and armored units have been deployed to the Golan buffer zone, established after the 1973 Yom Kippur War to separate Israeli and Syrian forces. IDF forces entered the demilitarized zone before dawn Sunday, following news that Syrian rebels had seized control of Damascus, forcing President Bashar Assad to flee. 'In accordance with the situational assessment following the recent events in Syria, including the entry of armed personnel into the buffer zone, the IDF has deployed forces in the buffer zone and in several other places necessary for its defense, to ensure the safety of the communities of the Golan Heights and the citizens of Israel,' the army said. 'The reinforcement of forces will enable strengthening the defense in the area and the preparation of forces for various scenarios in the sector.' The Israeli army emphasized Sunday that the IDF will not intervene in the Syrian civil war, but added that rebel forces must not enter the demilitarized zone. The IDF’s Northern Command has been placed on elevated alert over possible attacks by rebel forces. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi visited the border of the demilitarized zone Saturday before the collapse of the Assad regime, saying that Israeli forces were 'monitoring to ensure that local elements aren't moving in our direction.' 'We are very closely following what is happening,' Halevi continued. 'The main emphasis is to see the Iranian exit. 'The second thing is to see the local elements taking over the area, what they are doing, how they behave, how they are deterred, and [ensure] don’t get confused and turn in our direction.' In addition, Syrian media outlets reported that the Israeli air force has struck multiple targets in Syria, including arms factories and weapons caches. One target hit early Sunday morning has reportedly been identified as a chemical weapons plant, destroyed preemptively by Israel to prevent Islamist rebels from seizing weapons at the factory. Israeli Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli of the ruling Likud party called on the government to take full control over the DMZ, and establish a 'new line of defense' along the Syrian border. 'The events in Syria are far from being a cause for celebration,' Chikli tweeted Sunday morning. 'Despite the rebranding of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,' Chikli continued, referencing a Sunni Islamist rebel army, 'and its leader Ahmed al-Shara, the bottom line is that most of Syria is now under the control of affiliates of al-Qaeda and ISIS.' 'The good news is the strengthening of the Kurds and the expansion of their control in the north-east of the country (Deir ez-Zor area).' 'Operatively, Israel must renew its control at the peak of Mount Hermon and establish a new line of defense based on the 1974 ceasefire line, we must not allow jihadists to establish themselves near our settlements.'

Israel surprised by Syrian rebels’ victory, downfall of Assad	Israeli intelligence mistakenly believed that Assad would not be ousted, largely due to the support of Russia and Iran. By World Israel News Staff Israeli intelligence agencies were caught off-guard by the speed and success of the rebels' takeover of Syria, after the anti-government militias officially declared victory in ousting President Bashar al-Assad on Sunday. According to Hebrew-language outlet Yediot Ahronot, Israel intelligence indicated that Assad's grip on power in the country, which has been ravaged by more than a decade of civil war, was stable. Bolstered by support from Russian and Iran, Assad's position as the leader of Syria was not seriously threatened by the rebels, Israeli intelligence believed. For years, Russia provided intense military support to Assad, including conducting airstrikes on rebel groups and helping retake major cities, such as Palmyra, after they were captured by militias. Iran directed Hezbollah, its proxy group, to fight against the rebels in Syria in order to protect Assad. But with Russian forces stretched thin due to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, and Hezbollah suffering unprecedented blows during the conflict with Israel, Assad's strongest supporters did not provide the backing he needed to crush the rebel offensive. 'Tehran and Moscow did not foresee the collapse of the regime, but neither did Israel's intelligence agencies or the Mossad see anything like that on the horizon,' Israeli journalist Nadav Eyal wrote on his X account. 'With all due respect to our intelligence services, the Israeli assessment should have been better.' Israel is now grappling with unanticipated security concerns, as the Assad regime was toppled and the rebels are now in control of much of the country. It's widely understood that many of the rebel forces are funded and supported by Turkey, which has expressed major hostility towards Israel since the outbreak of the war against Hamas. Additionally, many rebel leaders adhere to an Islamist ideology, with some of the groups absorbed into the wider anti-Assad movement originating as offshoots of Al-Qaeda. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar warned the rebels that they are obligated to abide by existing security arrangements between Israel and Syria, or risking facing consequences from the IDF. Sa'ar noted that in recent days, armed militants had 'entered the buffer zone on the Syrian side of the border with Israel,' saying that constituted a violation of a May 1974 agreement to keep the area free of Israeli or Syrian troops. The presence of armed rebels near the Israeli border constitutes a threat to Israel's security, particularly the communities of the Golan Heights. Sa'ar stressed that Israel would act to protect its citizens and assets, but added that Jerusalem 'will not intervene in the internal conflict in Syria.'

Assad flees as Syrian rebels seize Damascus	Syrian President Bashar Assad ousted from power after 24 years in office, as rebel forces seize Damascus in blitz campaign. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Anti-regime forces in Syria seized the capital city of Damascus over the weekend, forcing the country's long-time president to flee the city. 'We declare the city of Damascus free from the tyrant Bashar al-Assad,' the rebel Military Operations Command announced via Telegram Sunday morning. Bashar Assad, 59, President of Syria since the death of his father and predecessor, Hafez Assad, in 2000, fled Damascus early Sunday morning, as rebels closed in on the city. According to a report by Reuters which cited two senior Syrian army officers, Assad boarded a plane at Damascus airport Sunday morning for an unknown destination. The sources added that Assad's plane disappeared from radar, raising the possibility that the aircraft crashed. According to the flight tracker website Flightrader, an aircraft registered with Syrian Air departed Damascus moments before the city's fall. The aircraft was tracked heading towards the Mediterranean coast before making a sudden U-turn and then dropping off the radar. By contrast, Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali remained in the capital, announcing that he would back a new government to replace Assad's regime. 'I hope everyone will act rationally,' al-Jalali said. 'I am ready to support the continued management of the country's affairs.' 'We are ready to cooperate with any leadership the people choose. We extend a hand to every Syrian citizen who wishes to preserve the country's capabilities and believe that Syria belongs to all Syrians.' The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based anti-Assad monitor group, has reported that the Syrian army's central command considers the Assad regime to be terminated, and his instructed its officer corps to act accordingly. After the fall of Damascus, thousands of residents gathered in the city's central square before dawn Sunday, chanting 'Freedom,' in Arabic. The capture of the Syrian capital came just hours after the fall of the city of Homs, part of a lightning campaign by rebels building on the momentum of their capture of the northern city of Aleppo a week earlier. Assad's flight from Damascus and the collapse of his regime marks the end of 53 years of rule by the Assad family, and 61 years under the Ba'ath party control of Syria.

Capt. Avraham Ben-Pinchas killed during battle in the Gaza Strip	Captain Avraham Ben-Pinchas is the 809th IDF soldier to be killed since October 7th, 2023. By World Israel News Staff Captain Avraham Ben-Pinchas was killed during combat in the northern Gaza Strip, the Israeli army announced in a statement on Saturday evening. Ben-Pinchas, 24, was a platoon commander in the 401st Armored Brigade's 46th Battalion. From the town of Harsha in the Binyamin region, Ben-Pinchas is survived by his parents and nine siblings. Hebrew-language media reported that he was killed by anti-tank missile fire. Two months ago, Ben-Pinchas sustained a serious head wound while fighting in the Strip. After recovering from his injury, he insisted upon returning to his unit. He is the 809th IDF soldier to be killed since October 7th, 2023. Out of those casualties, 381 were soldiers killed during ongoing ground operation in the Gaza Strip. 'We are shocked and saddened by the loss of our beloved student,' read a statement from the Roeh Israel Yeshiva in Yitzhar, where Ben-Pinchas studied. 'Avraham combined extensive knowledge, love of Torah, and practical abilities, which he put into practice during his years of study at the yeshiva, and later in his significant service as a soldier and commander in the armored forces,' the statement continued. 'He was dedicated to his soldiers and the mission, and fought in Gaza for most of the past year.' 'My heart is broken,' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said in a statement, adding that he sends his 'condolences and a strong embrace' to Ben-Pinchas' family and friends. Tragically, Ben-Pincha's death is not the first loss of a child for his family. His older sister, Efrat, was killed in a car accident four years ago, Hebrew-language media reported. Binyamin Regional Council Head Benjamin Yisrael Gantz eulogized Ben-Pinchas in a statement, saying that the entire community 'bows their heads in sorrow' over his killing. Noting the previous loss, Gantz said that the Ben-Pinchas family was experiencing 'heartbreak upon heartbreak.' The post Capt.

Three injured, one seriously, in Hebron car ramming attack	A 30-year-old IDF soldier who was seriously wounded during the attack with injuries to his limbs was evacuated to Soroka Medical Center. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Saturday night, a terrorist wounded three Israelis, one seriously, in a car ramming attack close to Hebron. The terrorist rammed the car at the al Fawar Junction, and the IDF said shots were fired at the assailant's vehicle. After fleeing to the nearby village of Dura, at 9 pm, the terrorist turned himself in to the police. A 30-year-old IDF soldier was seriously wounded in the attack with injuries to his limbs and was evacuated to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba to receive treatment. In addition, a 45-year-old man with light shrapnel wounds and another wounded civilian were also evacuated and treated at Soroka. Also, two other people at the scene were treated for shock. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) took responsibility for the attack and posted on social media, 'We praise the ramming attack carried out by one of the Mujahideen of our Palestinian people.' 'We affirm that this attack, along with others like it, clearly demonstrates our people's unwavering commitment to resistance as the sole option. It is a natural response to the fascist and Nazi tactics of the enemy against our people and the ongoing occupation of our land,' the statement continued. A Mount Hebron Council leader noted that a roadblock had been removed from the al-Fawar Junction not long before the terror attack. Eliram Azulay, head of the Mount Hebron Council, said, 'Two weeks after the roadblock at the al-Fawar Junction was lifted, a ramming attack took place tonight in which several soldiers were injured, one of them seriously.' 'We urge the IDF to block access to the main road from the surrounding villages and to launch a major operation to dismantle the 'terror nests' in the Hebron area and its villages. Easing restrictions for Arabs at the expense of civilian and soldier safety is rhetoric reminiscent of the period before the October 7th massacre.'

Hamas trying to locate living hostages ahead of potential deal	Sources say there has been significant 'progress on the indirect talks for a hostage deal,' although Hamas says a ceasefire should precede release of hostages. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Arab sources report that Hamas is in the process of locating living hostages prior to negotiations for a ceasefire and a captive-prisoner exchange deal. Asharq Al-Awsat reports that Hamas is contacting other terror groups holding hostages for updates on the number and conditions of living captives more than a year after they were kidnapped from Israel on October 7th. The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar reported that hostage deal negotiations have entered a 'final' phase. Although Hamas is also inquiring about the bodies of deceased hostages, they are currently focused on updates about hostages that are still alive. The sources say there has been significant 'progress on the indirect talks for a hostage deal,' although Hamas says a ceasefire should precede hostage releases. 'There are several bodies of hostages whose precise location remains unknown, partly because they were killed alongside their captors,' the sources told the London-based newspaper. 'It will take time to determine their exact whereabouts, so a ceasefire would be crucial in helping address this issue,' they continued. On Saturday morning, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani announced there is 'new momentum' in hostage deal negotiations. After speaking to sources close to US President-elect Donald Trump, Thani said that the differences between Israel's and Hamas's positions on the hostage release and ceasefire are 'not considerable.' Egyptian sources report that 'several points are still pending,' including governance and rebuilding of the Gaza Strip after the war. Regarding Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for hostages, Hamas is reportedly demanding that Palestinians who have been charged with severe crimes be released in exchange for every Israeli soldier hostage. The soldiers will be released in later phases of the hostage deal after 'humanitarian' captives are set free in the initial phase.

IDF assists UN troops on Israel-Syria border as rebels advance	IDF: 'We have deployed additional forces to the Golan Heights and will continue to take action to protect the State of Israel and its citizens.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF announced that it fought Syrian rebels after they threatened a UN position close to the Israel-Syria border. The rebels attacked UN forces near Hader in the lower Mount Hermon area, opposite the Israeli town of Majdal Shams, where 12 Bedouin children were killed by a Hezbollah rocket. In a statement, the IDF confirmed it was assisting UN forces. 'A short time ago, armed individuals launched an attack on a UN post in the Hader area of Syria. The IDF is currently supporting UN forces in repelling the assault.' 'The IDF has deployed additional forces to the Golan Heights and will continue to take action to protect the State of Israel and its citizens.' Earlier reports indicated that rebel forces had taken control of the area close to Syria's border with Israel after defeating government forces. Syrian rebels seized the strategic city of Hama on Thursday, marking a significant victory after a rapid advance across northern Syria. The capture dealt a severe setback to President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies. In response, the Syrian military announced it was redeploying forces outside the city 'to protect civilian lives and avoid urban combat' following what it described as intense clashes. Rebel forces indicated they were preparing to continue their push southward toward Homs, a key crossroads city that connects Damascus to the north and the coast. 'Your time has come,' said a rebel operations room in an online post, calling city residents to rise up in revolution. The rebels captured the northern city of Aleppo last week and have since advanced south from their stronghold in northwest Syria. Intense fighting has been ongoing for two days around villages near Hama. The capture of Hama, which had remained under government control since the start of the civil war triggered by the 2011 rebellion against Assad, is expected to send shockwaves through Damascus and fuel fears of a continued rebel advance southward.

Five Israelis killed in car accident in Morocco	The fatal incident is the result of an apparent accident after the driver lost control of the vehicle. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Five Israelis from Tzfat in northern Israel were killed Friday morning after their car overturned in Morocco, Zaka reports. The fatal incident is the result of an apparent accident after the driver lost control of the vehicle. They traveled to the country to visit the gravesites of righteous Jews. When they were driving in Ouarzazate in south-central Morocco at about 10 am, their car overturned, killing everyone inside the vehicle, Zaka said. Haim Weingarten, Deputy Director General of ZAKA, said: 'From the moment we received the report of this tragic incident, our international unit has been working closely with Moroccan authorities to expedite the identification and release of the bodies, while also providing support to the families in arranging for their proper burial.' A few months ago, Israel's National Security Council advised against unessential travel to Morocco in light of the risk of terror groups targeting Israelis abroad. The warning against travel to Morocco was raised to Level 3, signaling a moderate threat. This is a developing story. &#038;nbsp The post Five Israelis killed in car accident in Morocco appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/five-israelis-killed-in-car-accident-in-morocco/	2024-12-06T05:16:35-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/F170813DCFF04.jpg

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a viral video, A senior Iranian official warned that Israel's military might is 'not a joke.' Madhi Afraaz, a senior official at the Khomeini Policy Institute, is affiliated with the Iranian regime. In the video, he said, 'Our friends think that military action against Israel is a PlayStation game.' He continued, 'You have to understand that the military power of Israel is the military power of the West – it's not a joke at all.' Afraaz urges Iranians to heed the warnings of Hezbollah, which has lost its leaders and much of its infrastructure in Israeli military operations. 'Last year, one of our friends in Hezbollah told us: 'You Iranians are ignorant about the power of Israel, and you make a joke of it. And you see how Israel eliminates Hezbollah members before they even grasp what's going on.' To illustrate his point, Afraaz described how easy it would be for Israel to hit Iran's most important oil refinery, The Persian Gulf Star, which supplies 70% of Iran's gas stations. He said to attack The Persian Gulf Star, 'Israel wouldn't even need to enter Iran's airspace. It could launch the bomb from the base in Bahrain, and the bomb could fly 300 kilometers. That's how Israel could directly attack Iran if we didn't have air defense systems.' He added, 'We shouldn't delude ourselves. Even when our inferior forces are brazen and decide to attack Israel, it's considered as 'throwing your burden on the Almighty.' The Israeli military on Monday warned Iran that the IDF has monitored Iranian forces operating in Syria to bolster the Assad regime, adding that Israel will not tolerate Tehran using its foothold on Israel's northern border to reinforce Hezbollah. Speaking with Sky News Arabia, IDF Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari accused Iran of attempting to transfer weapons to Hezbollah to help the terror group rebuild its operational capabilities during the ceasefire with Israel. 'The Iranian regime continues its attempts to transfer weapons to Hezbollah,' Hagari said, 'which Israel considers a direct threat to its national security.' Hagari hinted that should Israel detect Iran shipping weapons to Hezbollah, the IDF would take action while declining to specify what form Israel's response would take.

Israeli defense officials stated that the military will continue to take proactive measures to neutralize potential threats, maintaining a clear message that any infrastructure supporting terrorist activities will be targeted. By Anna Epshtein, TPS The Israeli Air Force conducted a precision strike overnight targeting weapon transfer routes and terror infrastructures near the Syria-Lebanon border, disrupting Hezbollah’s potential to launch attacks against Israel. Military sources reported that the strike focused on routes used by Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, a specialized weapons procurement and transfer unit. The operation aimed to intercept potential weapon shipments before they could be deployed against Israeli targets. The IDF emphasized that the strike is part of an ongoing campaign to prevent Hezbollah from establishing military capabilities near Israel’s northern border. Syrian regime infrastructure reportedly facilitated these weapon transfer routes. Israeli defense officials stated that the military will continue to take proactive measures to neutralize potential threats, maintaining a clear message that any infrastructure supporting terrorist activities will be targeted. This latest operation underscores the ongoing tension between Israel and Hezbollah, with a fragile weeklong ceasefire being tested by Hezbollah. On December 2, Hezbollah fired two missiles at Mount Dov, an area of northern Israel where the borders of Israel, Lebanon and Syria converge on Monday. The barrage was the first since a ceasefire took effect on Wednesday morning. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the barrage, calling it 'a warning' to Israel. The rocketfire came as the United States and France claimed that Israel was violating the ceasefire. According to Hebrew media reports, the issue is Israeli surveillance flights over Beirut, which Washington and Paris claim breaks the ceasefire. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar responded, saying,' 'The opposite is true – Israel is working to enforce the agreement in response to violations by Hezbollah, which require immediate action. For example, when armed Hezbollah terrorists are identified in southern Lebanon or when an attempt is made to transfer weapons.'

Jewish Democrat announces primary challenge against anti-Israel N...	The incumbent councilwoman also voted against a resolution to establish 'End Jew Hatred Day' in New York City. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner Maya Kornberg, a Jewish Democrat from Brooklyn, New York, has launched a campaign to unseat New York City Councilwoman Shahana Hanif, an outspoken critic of Israel. Kornberg announced on Tuesday that she will seek to represent District 39 in the New York City Council. Much of the city’s Jewish community has expressed outrage at Hanif over her repeated repudiations of Israel, including her false accusations that the war against the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza constitutes a 'genocide.' 'I am thrilled to announce that I’m running for NYC Council in District 39! With the Trump presidency looming, local governance is more important than ever, and the City Council is our best line of defense,' Kornberg wrote on X/Twitter on Tuesday. 'Together, I believe we can build a district where everyone can feel happy, safe, and thrive.' 'I’ve dedicated my career to making democracy work better,' Kornberg added in a statement, promising that if elected she will concentrate on 'standing up against hate, providing reliable constituent services, and delivering meaningful change for every resident in every corner of the district.' Kornberg’s decision to enter next June’s Democratic primary contest sets up a showdown between a self-described 'pragmatic' liberal and a far-left democratic socialist. Hanif, who represents heavily Jewish neighborhoods in central Brooklyn such as Park Slope, has reportedly enraged her constituents by ignoring concerns about antisemitism and unloading an unrelenting barrage of criticism directed at Israel. Following Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel last Oct. 7, Hanif issued a statement blaming the Jewish state for the terrorist attacks. 'The root cause of this war is the illegal, immoral, and unjust occupation of the Palestinian people. The Occupation has brought violence toward Israelis and Palestinians for over 75 years. There will be no peace unless the rights of all people in this region are respected,' Hanif wrote on X/Twitter on Oct. 13. Despite Hanif’s presence on New York’s 'Taskforce to Combat Hate,' she has reportedly refused to denounce acts of antisemitic vandalism and graffiti around the city. Hanif was also arrested at an October 2023 'ceasefire' rally organized by the anti-Israel Democratic Socialists of America organization. At the rally, protesters chanted 'from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free' — a popular slogan among anti-Israel activists that has been widely interpreted as a call for the destruction of the Jewish state, which is located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea — and held up signs reading 'No, I do not condemn Hamas.' Hanif later participated in the anti-Israel encampments at Columbia University in April. She posted a photo of herself from the center of the encampment, sporting a red keffiyeh and smiling. 'I’m proud to witness disciplined leadership from students mobilize for peace and against genocide,' Hanif wrote. The incumbent councilwoman also voted against a resolution to establish 'End Jew Hatred Day' in New York City, claiming that it had been brought forth by a 'coalition that has concerning ties to far-right politicians who promote problematic and hateful rhetoric.' Kornberg, who has reportedly spent months fundraising to enter the primary race, is expected to receive substantial backing from the community’s pro-Israel constituents. Many District 39 constituents have expressed exasperation with Hanif’s unwillingness to publicly apologize for her past commentary and hesitance to tackle surging antisemitic hate crimes in the city. The impending battle between Kornberg and Hanif comes on the heels of New York City experiencing a somewhat rightward shift in the 2024 presidential election. Every single county in the New York City metropolitan area moved toward Trump compared to four years ago, and the Republican president-elect’s margin of defeat in the heavily Democratic city was 16 points narrower than in 2020. In the wake of last month’s surprising election results, many Democrats are modulating their approach to controversial topics such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, seeking to strike a more moderate tone. Many observers believe the District 39 primary race could indicate whether the deep-blue city has made an enduring shift away from far-left progressivism.

Five Israelis arrested after being caught crossing into Lebanon	The local police chief noted that the group was unarmed and claimed during questioning to have wandered into the warzone by accident. By JNS Police detained five residents of Arad, a city located west of the Dead Sea, on Wednesday after Israel Defense Forces soldiers caught them crossing into Southern Lebanon, the Israel Police said on Thursday. 'This morning, we received a report from the regional division about five civilians from Arad who crossed the fence,' Kiryat Shmona police head Ch. Supt. Arik Berkovitch said in a statement cited by Ynet. 'The civilians were on a trip to the north and continued it into Lebanon. This is extremely dangerous. Lebanon is a clear enemy state, and these civilians could have been harmed from two sides,' Berkovitch added. The local police chief noted that the group was unarmed and claimed during questioning to have wandered into the warzone by accident. 'The Israel Police reminds the public that traveling to the area around the border fence is prohibited and dangerous, especially as crossing the border with Lebanon is prohibited by law. The punishment for violating the law is up to four years in prison,' the police statement concluded. While the Nov. 26 truce deal brought an end to active hostilities between Jerusalem and Hezbollah, under its terms, IDF soldiers remain in Southern Lebanon for 60 days. Meanwhile, the Iranian-backed terrorist organization regularly violates the agreement. On Nov. 20, Ze’ev Erlich, 71, a scholar and archaeological expert on the Land of Israel, was killed in a firefight with Hezbollah terrorists after entering Lebanon as a civilian alongside IDF troops. Sgt. Gur Kehati, 20, of the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, from Moshav Nir Banim, was also killed in the attack, which took place at an archeological site some four miles from Israel’s northern border. Though Erlich was not an active reservist, the military’s Personnel Directorate (formerly called the Manpower Directorate and the Human Resources Directorate) decided to recognize him as a fallen IDF soldier. The circumstances surrounding his death are the subject of a probe. Col. (res.) Yoav Yarom, the chief of staff of the Golani Brigade who was wounded alongside Erlich, left his position following the incident. 'In light of the values ​​I was brought up on and preached, being that ‘actions speak louder than words,’ I believe that I must take operational responsibility for the event,' Yarom wrote in his resignation letter.

Tahrir collected detailed intelligence about IDF movements, including photographs of tanks, armed soldiers, equipment, and weapons. By Anna Epshtein, TPS The Shin Bet security service and Israeli Police have arrested two residents of Mas’ade village who were allegedly recruited by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards to gather intelligence on IDF activities. Mas’ade is a Druze village in the Israeli Golan Heights. Tahrir Zafdi, a 21-year-old software engineering student, and his father Bassam Zafdi were detained for conducting espionage operations. According to the investigation, Tahrir collected detailed intelligence about IDF movements, including photographs of tanks, armed soldiers, equipment, and weapons. The intelligence was reportedly passed to Hussam al-Salam Tawfiq Zidan, a journalist with the Iranian 'Al-Alam' channel based in Damascus, who works with the Palestinian branch of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force. Investigators revealed that Tahrir continued his espionage activities during the ongoing conflict, collecting information about the IDF troop movements and even missile strike locations. A severe indictment for espionage has been filed against Tahrir. Bassam Zafdi was also arrested and, due to the high security risk, the Defense Minister signed an administrative detention order. The case highlights Iran’s ongoing efforts to recruit Israeli citizens for intelligence gathering. Israeli authorities have uncovered lately multiple instances of Iranian intelligence recruitment targeting Israeli citizens, including Jews, Arabs, Druze, and Bedouins. On October 31, prosecutors in Tel Aviv filed an indictment against an Israeli man accused of spying on a nuclear scientist who Iranian intelligence sought to assassinate. Among other numerous cases are the one in which two Israelis were arrested for their involvement in an Iranian plot to assassinate a high-profile Israeli figure. Another seven Israelis arrested for planning to assassinate a senior Israeli scientist and the mayor of a large Israeli city.

Republican leaders demand Biden-Harris admin freeze lame duck gre...	The office is also reviewing applications requesting an eye-popping total of $324.3 billion, up from the $303.5 billion reported last month. By Thomas Catenacci, The Washington Free Beacon House GOP leaders are calling on the Biden-Harris administration to immediately freeze its behemoth green energy loan disbursements, which officials have accelerated in recent weeks ahead of President Donald Trump's upcoming term, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.), Morgan Griffith (R., Va.), and Jeff Duncan (R., S.C.), all of whom serve in top positions on the Energy and Commerce Committee, penned a letter Wednesday to the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office, arguing that its recent flood of loans presents substantial financial risks to taxpayers. They added that the accelerated spending appears motivated by looming cuts to green energy loan programs, which Trump has promised to 'terminate.' The Republicans cite a recent Free Beacon analysis that tracked all pending and closed green loans dished out by the Loan Programs Office. Since that analysis was published last month, the office's total financial commitments have increased from $37.6 billion to nearly $57 billion, a jump driven in large part by multibillion-dollar loans promised to automakers Rivian and Stellantis for electric vehicle projects. The office is also reviewing applications requesting an eye-popping total of $324.3 billion, up from the $303.5 billion reported last month. The letter underscores the risks of fraud and abuse of taxpayer funds posed by big-budget green programs, something Republicans have raised the alarm about since the Biden-Harris administration made green spending programs a centerpiece of its aggressive climate agenda. Those concerns have been amplified by the newfound urgency in disbursing green loans ahead of the Trump administration, leaving lawmakers to worry if such loans are receiving proper vetting. 'The last-minute drive to expedite loans exposes the federal government—and American taxpayers—to tremendous risk,' McMorris Rodgers, Griffith, and Duncan wrote to Loan Programs Office director Jigar Shah, according to the letter obtained by the Free Beacon. 'On election day, the American people rejected the Biden-Harris administration’s rush-to-green agenda,' they continued. 'To honor the will of our electorate and facilitate an orderly transition, we insist that the Biden-Harris administration cease its campaign to quickly distribute federal funding before the incoming administration takes office.' The Loan Programs Office's spending, meanwhile, was flagged by the Department of Energy's Office of Inspector General in a report last month highlighting how the office's loan authority has skyrocketed from $17.2 billion in 2021 to at least $402.2 billion, thanks to President Joe Biden's landmark Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. The inspector general found that near-term deadlines may create pressure to cut corners; innovative projects that can only receive government funding, not private sector investment, come with 'inherent risks;' accelerated due diligence of a proposal's financial viability may fail, and the Loan Programs Office may fund foreign adversaries. Altogether, the spending comes with an outsized risk of loan default 'with the taxpayer picking up the bill.' Overall, since September, the Loan Programs Office has announced conditional loan commitments worth a total of $25.5 billion for nine projects, Department of Energy data shows. It has closed on another $6.2 billion worth of loans for eight other projects in that same time span. And since the election one month ago, the office has announced or closed on loans worth $20.6 billion to the following companies: Sunwealth for solar systems across 27 states, Grain Belt Express for a wind energy transmission line, Rivian for an EV assembly plant, Stellantis for a joint project with battery maker Samsung, Li-Cycle for EV battery materials processing, SK Siltron CSS for EV battery components manufacturing, and Eos Energy Enterprises for a battery storage systems project. By comparison, between January 2021 and September 2024, it announced commitments worth less than $20 billion and closed on loans worth roughly $6 billion. 'This is an egregious abuse of taxpayer dollars,' Tom Pyle, the president of the Institute for Energy Research and member of the 2016 Trump transition team, told the Free Beacon last month. 'Not one additional loan should go out the door between now and the inauguration. President Trump ran on an energy platform that included repealing the subsidies in the IRA and yet Biden is trying to rush this money out the door before he rides off into the Delaware sunset.' 'On day one, I hope the Trump administration will halt all loans that are not closed and audit all of the projects that have been approved, but especially the ones they are attempting to rush out the door since the election,' Pyle said.

Israel’s military is acknowledging that soldiers’ helmets and bod...	More than 400 Israeli soldiers have been killed and 12,000 have been injured in combat in Gaza, Lebanon and other fronts since Israel began its ground offensive last October. By Asaf Elia-Shalev, JTA A new website quietly launched by the Israeli military lets soldiers anonymously check whether their safety equipment complies with official standards, in a tacit admission both that donated gear is widespread, and that army-issued gear may be unsafe. It’s the latest development in a debate that has gone on since the start of the war in Gaza over whether the army is adequately supplying troops with protective equipment. The military has long claimed that it gives soldiers everything they need and has cast donated gear as potentially harmful. But it is now officially telling soldiers that if they are using certain army-issued combat gear, their lives could be in danger. For example, the website says that any ceramic body armor plates manufactured before 2009 that were provided by the army must be replaced. So must any army-issued helmet made of metal. Members of the volunteer network providing soldiers with hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of donated gear throughout the war have long tried to sound the alarm about troops being sent to battle with gear that’s outdated and unsafe. For these civilian watchdogs, the launch of the website provides validation. 'The first step to address a problem is to admit that it exists,' said Daniel Mael, who leads a donation drive known as Unit 11741. 'While it is too late for many soldiers who fell due to subpar equipment, let’s hope that the website can usher in an era of further awareness about the need for safe equipment in the battlefield and that the IDF begins to provide safe gear to all of its combat soldiers and reservists.' In the website’s Q&A section, the Israel Defense Forces confirms that the use of bad gear has had real consequences. 'There have been a number of cases where the use of equipment not meeting army standards caused combat injuries and even worse,' the website says. The statement does not say any such incident was tied to gear issued by the military. More than 400 Israeli soldiers have been killed and 12,000 have been injured in combat in Gaza, Lebanon and other fronts since Israel began its ground offensive last October. Israel and Hezbollah reached a ceasefire agreement last month to end their conflict in Lebanon and northern Israel, but sporadic attacks from both sides have tested the truce. Israel continues to maintain a large military presence in Gaza, fighting the remnants of Hamas. Talks between the two sides to pause the fighting and release Israeli hostages held in Gaza as well as Palestinian security prisoners in Israel have not borne fruit for more than a year. According to official policy, which the army has done little to enforce, soldiers are prohibited from accepting donations. One of the concerns behind the prohibition is that it’s difficult to monitor dispersed donations to individual soldiers and units for compliance with safety standards. The army spokesperson’s office did not respond to specific questions from the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, releasing a statement that frames the website as a response to the reality of widespread gear donations. 'At the beginning of the war, due to the large-scale volunteering of reserve soldiers, a phenomenon emerged of bringing non-standard equipment into units,' the statement said. 'In light of this phenomenon, the IDF’s policy on the procedure for receiving equipment has been clarified, ensuring that all necessary checks are included and preventing risks to the forces due to operational ineffectiveness or safety hazards. At the end of November, a website was launched by the Ground Forces and the Ground Technology Division in the Technological and Logistics Directorate, with the purpose of providing a solution for checking the equipment’s compliance.' The website invites anyone on the internet, without asking for identification, to answer a series of questions to see if a piece of gear is safe. Only helmets, ceramic body armor plates and tactical goggles are covered, leaving out items like earplugs and fire-resistant tactical uniforms used, for example, in armored units. The questions include: Was the item issued by the military or donated to you? How old is it? What material is it made of? Who’s the manufacturer? In the end, users get one of two results. Either the item is 'compliant' or it’s 'non-compliant and endangers your life,' which means the soldier should request a replacement. Some soldiers say they have been issued newer gear that later suffered severe damage that could compromise effectiveness. But none of the questions concern the condition of the gear, so a new army-issued Kevlar helmet that has been dented or punctured by a bullet would pass the test, which some have flagged as a problem. 'They’re basically telling you, ‘Don’t worry, everything’s fine,’ on the basis of very superficial checks,' said one civilian volunteer, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid jeopardizing his relationships with cooperative military officials. So far, the army has done little to publicize the website and it’s unclear how many soldiers are using it. That it’s gotten any public notice at all is probably because of Micha Shtiebel, an American-raised combat reservist in the Israeli military. He’s been on a mission to get the military to admit it has a problem and fix it, lobbying lawmakers and speaking to the media. He’s used the attention he’s gotten, combined with research he’s collected, to develop relationships with key departments within the military and Defense Ministry. Shtiebel says he found allies among engineers and scientists in the military’s Directorate of Defense, Research & Development. 'It turned out these guys were already aware of the problem and proposing solutions but never getting any approval,' Shtiebel said in an interview. He said he managed to get them a meeting with decision-makers to discuss a plan to test protective equipment, and that their plan was approved. The testing, Shtiebel said, formed the basis for the new website. About two weeks ago, one of his contacts in the directorate sent him a link to the website. 'I don’t think they realize that I shared it and it’s out in the wild,' Shtiebel said. 'They told me it’s an early beta and that they were excited and wanted me to see it, and I immediately went ahead and shared it with everybody.' Shtiebel said he counts the website as a critical victory in his quest. 'I was finally able to apply the right pressure to get things moving,' he said. 'This project showed that with enough pressure, we can tackle these big bureaucratic problems,' Shtiebel said. 'I wish the army would stop what it’s been doing, apologize and be accountable. But for now, I’ll take the win. At least they’re addressing the issue.'

‘We respect Israel and Trump,’ says Syrian rebel commander	Abu Obdo, a commander of the Free Syrian Army's forces in Aleppo, says rebels and Israel are fighting a 'common enemy.' By World Israel News Staff Anti-Assad rebels who captured the northern city of Aleppo a week ago sympathize with Israel and the United States, a rebel leader said Wednesday, emphasizing that despite historic Syrian tensions with the Jewish state, Israel and the rebels 'are fighting against a common enemy.' In an interview with i24NEWS, Abu Abdo - the nom guerrilla of one of the Free Syrian Army's commanders in Aleppo - highlighted the common ground between the United States and Israel on one hand, and the rebel forces attempting to depose Syrian President Bashar Assad and to terminate foreign influence over Syria. Former early in the Syrian Civil War in 2011, the Free Syrian Army (also known as the Syrian National Army) was established by a group of Syrian army defectors opposed to Assad's handling of the nascent uprising. Along with other anti-regime forces, the rebels have fought since 2011 against the Syrian military, and allied Iranian-backed militias and even the Russian military, which has intervened repeatedly to bolster Assad's government. The Syrian National Army/Free Syrian Army's inclusion of a variety of anti-Assad elements - including Sunni Muslim fundamentalists - has sparked concern in the West and Israel that recent victories by rebel forces in northern Syria could lead to the takeover of the hitherto secular Ba'athist Syrian government by radical Islamists. However, Abu Abdo downplayed those concerns, saying that the SNA/FSA's members are 'neither extremists or terrorists.' Rather, the group is a constellation of Syrians united by the desire to terminate Iranian influence, via the Assad regime, over their country. Iran and its proxies, said Abu Abdo are 'dreaming of returning to the glory days of the historical Persian Empire, but it won't happen if we all face them.' 'I insist and tell all people in the region that we are activists for peace,' he continued. 'We are not murderous, warlike, and destructive activists. We defend ourselves from injustice and want to build our future Syrian state.' The SNA/FSA is, despite some clear differences, a natural ally of both Israel and the U.S., Abu Abdo continued. 'We look at Israel and the US, with the arrival of President Donald Trump, and we have a lot of respect and sympathy for them, for their actions against Iran – the country that leads terrorism in the region and all over the world.'

‘There’s no accountability’: Senators berate cybersecurity offici...	None of the at least eight breached U.S. telecommunications providers have managed to oust the hackers from their networks. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Senators berated the Biden administration’s cybersecurity officials for their weak response and lack of accountability following a massive Chinese government-linked hack of U.S. and global telecommunications networks, Politico reported. 'There’s no accountability in anybody sitting up there. They have not told us why they didn’t catch it, what they’ve done to prevent it,' Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) said after a classified briefing Wednesday by the FBI, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. First announced in November, the breach by Salt Typhoon, a group operated by the Chinese Communist Party, 'involved the infiltration of dozens of telecommunications companies, the hack of phones belonging to officials including President-elect Donald Trump and potential eavesdropping on the phone calls of large swaths of the U.S. population,' according to Politico. None of the at least eight breached U.S. telecommunications providers have managed to oust the hackers from their networks, according to Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology. 'If somebody came to my office and said, ‘Hey look, something bad happened, don’t worry, I’m responsible for it, but I’m not going to be responsible for it, and I don’t have any plan to fix it,’ what would you do? You’d fire them,' Scott said. Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) said the extent of the breach was 'breathtaking' and pushed officials to declassify more information. 'I think the American people need to know the extent of the breach here. I think they will be shocked at the extent of it,' Hawley said. 'I think they need to know about their text messages, their voicemail, their phone calls. It’s very bad, it’s very, very bad, and it is ongoing.' 'It’s the most disturbing and widespread incursion into our telecommunications systems in the history of the world, not just the country, because of how massive our telecommunications system is,' Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) said. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Mark Warner (D., Va.), a former telecommunications executive, slammed the companies for allowing 'gaping holes' in the security of critical systems. 'I think there is huge concern, far and away the worst telecom hack, and the fact is that they are still in the systems,' Warner said after the briefing. Warner and other lawmakers have started pushing for legislation to secure the U.S. telecommunications network before the end of the year, according to the Washington Examiner. Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.), who will run the Senate Armed Services Committee’s cyber subcommittee in the next Congress, noted that there should be regulations for these companies. 'The question is what’s the appropriate way to put them into play that [telecom companies] can actually adhere to them,' Rounds said. 'That legislation, I believe, will be coming.'

‘Hezbollah planned its own October 7th’ – Israeli intel officer	Conquer the Galilee' - Lebanese terror group plotted massive invasion of northern Israel, including capturing towns and raiding cities. By World Israel News Staff The Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah planned a massive, October 7th-style invasion of northern Israel, which was only foiled by Israeli forces after Hamas’ own attacks on southwestern Israel last fall, an Israeli military intelligence officer said. 'Hezbollah has been planning their own 10/7,' the officer told Fox News. According to Hezbollah documents recovered by the Israeli military during its offensive in southern Lebanon, the Shi’ite terror organization had planned a large-scale invasion of northern Israel for over a decade. The plot was only foiled after Hamas’ October 7th invasion, during the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which began with terror attacks on northern Israel a day after Hamas’ invasion. 'The plan has been effectively eliminated. We dismantled the high-level command of Radwan.' The Radwan Force, Hezbollah’s elite terror unit, was to have spearheaded the invasion of Israel, just as Hamas’ Nukhba Force had initiated the first attacks on Israel on October 7th. According to captured Hezbollah documents obtained by Fox News, the terror group had originally conceived of its invasion plan in 2011, dubbing it 'Conquer the Galilee.' 'Nasrallah’s 2011 plan to conquer the Galilee was massive,' the Israeli intel officer said. 'We destroyed their infrastructure and set them back a few decades. This plan can never be allowed to become practical again.' The invasion would have included concentrated efforts to capture or raid major border towns and even cities across northern Israel, including Tiberias, Nahariya, and Kiryat Shmona. 'Company 1143 will provide air defense to secure the operational area and prevent enemy aircraft from disrupting the maneuvering forces, with the goal of capturing Kiryat Shmona,' read one document prepared by a Hezbollah operative. In 2019, Hassan Nasrallah, the late secretary-general of Hezbollah, publicly discussed the plan on the pro-Hezbollah Al-Manar television channel. 'It is a plan for which we train, and prepare… We have prepared this plan. It is complete. Yes, part of our plan for the next war is to enter the Galilee,' said Nasrallah.

Hamas responsible for failure to reach ceasefire, hostage deal, s...	Very Rigid' - US Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew blames Hamas for deadlocked hostage talks and failure to reach a ceasefire, accusing terror group of 'hardening their position.' By World Israel News Staff Hamas is to blame for deadlocked hostage deal talks and efforts to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, America’s top envoy to Israel said Thursday. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew told Kan 11 News Thursday that while he believed some of Israel’s actions 'have distracted attention' from Hamas’ recalcitrance, he emphasized that the terror group was primarily to blame for the months of failed talks in Doha and Cairo. 'Overall, Hamas has been very rigid,' said Lew. 'In the weeks leading up to the murder of the six hostages, we were seeing no movement at all. We were negotiating where some of the names we were negotiating over were killed on [the] day where the six hostages were killed.' Lew made a veiled criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who in early September held a press conference on ceasefire talks, appearing in front of a map of the Gaza Strip to highlight the strategic importance of the Philadelphi Corridor on the Gaza-Egypt border, and the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza. 'I think that some of the things that the government of Israel has done have distracted attention from the fact that Hamas has been so rigid,' said Lew. 'Most people think that the Philadelphi Corridor was the biggest issue, because the government here talked about the Philadelphi Corridor. In fact, there was a constructive negotiation on the Philadelphi Corridor that could have led to a phase one deal, and Hamas was rigidly insisting on tougher terms in terms of prisoners and rights to have say over who gets released.' 'They were hardening their position but the world doesn’t necessarily know that because the maps of the Philadelphi Corridor was what they saw. So, I think that the resistance has come from Hamas, in large part, but some of the actions taken by the government of Israel shifted the focus from Hamas in a way that’s not helpful.' Lew downplayed the divide between the Biden White House and the Israeli government during the Gaza war, and denied the administration withheld weapons other than aerial munitions. 'There was never an embargo. It is a fiction that there was an arms embargo. There’s one munition that we have held, and that is 2,000-pound bombs. Everything else is business as usual. Sometimes business as usual takes a little bit longer than you wanted to because there’s bureaucratic steps that are involved.' The Israeli government and Republican lawmakers accused the Biden White House of also slow-walking the transfer of additional weapons systems, including armored vehicles and fighter jets.

Only survivor of 6,000 Jewish children deported from France dies,...	On July 20, 1942, Henri, his brother, sister, and father were crammed into cattle cars with 824 others and deported in convoy No. 8 from Angers to Auschwitz-Birkenau. By David Isaac, JNS Henri Borlant, the sole survivor of the 6,000 Jewish children under the age of 16 who were deported from France to Auschwitz in 1942, died on Dec. 3, aged 97. Borlant spoke often of his experiences to schools. In 2011, he published a book, 'Merci d’avoir survécu' ('Thank you for surviving.') The title came from a note he received from a 15-year-old boy who heard the story of his deportation. The Shoah Memorial saluted his memory in a tweet. Le Mémorial de la Shoah présente ses sincères condoléances à son épouse Hella, à leurs filles et à l’ensemble de sa famille. Le Mémorial de la Shoah salue la mémoire d’une figure de la mémoire de la Shoah en France, profondément humble et engagée.#hommage #temoin #shoah pic.twitter.com/LBqAPQIudF &mdash; Mémorial de la Shoah (@Shoah_Memorial) December 4, 2024 Born Hirsch Borlant in Paris on June 5, 1927, Henri was the fourth of 10 children. His parents were naturalized French citizens from Russia. In 1939, the French authorities evacuated Paris’s 13th arrondissement and in August, his family fled to Maine-et-Loire in Anjou in Western France. Borlant recounted that they were warmly welcomed by the locals and had no idea what lay in store for them. As a precaution, the children, who were educated at a Catholic school, were baptized. Borlant became a Catholic. On July 15, 1942, his mother, brother Bernard, sister Denise and he were arrested by German soldiers. 'They had a list and took everyone who was between 15 and 50 years old,' he said. Two days later, his mother, Rachel, was released and replaced by his father, Aron. No explanation was given, according to an interview he gave to the Maine-et-Loire region website. Henri Borlant. Credit: Collection Henri Borlant. On July 20, 1942, Henri, his brother, sister and father were crammed into cattle cars with 824 others and deported in convoy No. 8 from Angers to Auschwitz-Birkenau, the Shoah Memorial said. As he was transported, he tossed out a note: 'Dear Mom, it seems that we are going to Ukraine to harvest.' The letter reached his mother thanks to a railway worker. Upon arrival at Auschwitz, his sister was killed immediately. His father and brother also would not survive the camp. 'Our extermination was planned, programmed,' he wrote in his book. 'We knew that we were living our last moments. The hope that all this would be known one day fueled our will to survive.' As the Red Army closed in, he was transferred by train to the Sachsenhausen camp, then sent to the Oranienburg camp to work in the Heinkel aircraft factory. In November 1944, Henri was transferred to Ohrdruf-Buchenwald, a Buchenwald annex camp. Henri Borlant posing at a sanatorium in Bavaria. Germany, 1945. Credit: Mémorial de la Shoah/collection Henri Borlant. Borlant managed to escape from Ohrdruf-Buchenwald shortly before the Americans arrived, hiding with an anti-Nazi meat seller. He was repatriated to France on April 16, 1945, and reunited with his mother and siblings, who were not deported and survived. Borlant suffered from tuberculosis on his return, but managed to study medicine and become a doctor. Like many survivors, he kept his experiences secret, but in the 1990s, he began to speak of what he endured and collect testimonies within the association Témoignage pour mémoire. He was a member of the Foundation for the Memory of the Deportation and served on the educational commission of the Shoah Memorial.

Female IDF observers will be given weapons	The plan, which will be implemented in 6 weeks, will provide each IDF observer with a Tabor-type weapon. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News More than a year after the Hamas invasion on October 7 when female border observers were targeted, the IDF has decided to provide them with weapons. The plan, which will be implemented in 6 weeks, will provide each IDF observer with a Tabor-type weapon after they complete training. The decision comes after criticism that the female observers were left unarmed close to the Gaza border when Hamas invaded. The IDF also received criticism for the failure to follow up on the observers' reports of increased Hamas activity on the border shortly before the invasion. Female lookouts on the Gaza border said their warnings and reports were not heeded before the October 7th massacre according to a report by the BBC. 'Why are we here if no one’s listening?' Shahaf Ashram, one of the first Nahal Oz lookouts killed by Hamas, complained to her mother Illana shortly before October 7th. The mainly female lookouts, known as tatzpitaniyot, provide a crucial service to the IDF and are often called, 'The eyes on the border.' Their task is to watch the border every second–without squinting or looking away for even the briefest moment, and to record what they see. The lookouts noticed highly suspicious behavior on the border for several months before the invasions and reported what they saw, but when they expressed concerns, they were often ignored. One lookout who called herself 'Noa' said that when she tried to raise the alarm about the things they saw, they were told that their job was only to watch, and said, 'We were just the eyes.' However, Noa said that the lookouts knew that there was a 'balloon that was about to burst' on the border. The lookouts also said they saw people detonating bombs on the wall between Gaza and Israel to test its strength in the weeks leading up to October 7th.

BYU’s star Jewish quarterback Jake Retzlaff scores sponsorship de...	It will include a limited run of Retzlaff matzah boxes that won’t be available in stores but will be distributed in a giveaway, as well as social media and video content including Retzlaff and showcasing recipes and holiday traditions. By Jacob Gurvis, JTA After a historic football season at BYU, Jake Retzlaff’s latest honor places him in the company of Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali: having his face grace an iconic box of food. Retzlaff, the star quarterback at Brigham Young University, has nabbed a sponsorship deal with Manischewitz, the Jewish food company’s first-ever sports deal. The deal includes special-edition boxes of Manischewitz matzah emblazoned with Retzlaff’s likeness. Retzlaff, 21, who grew up attending a Reform synagogue in Pomona, California, is BYU’s first Jewish starting quarterback and one of only three Jewish students at the Mormon flagship in Utah. His story has resonated with fans, Jewish and not, both because of his athletic prowess — he threw 20 touchdowns as he led BYU to a 10-2 record in the Big-12 Conference and a top-25 national ranking — and because of his public embrace of his Jewish identity. Retzlaff wears a Star of David necklace around campus and has taken on the nickname 'BY-Jew.' Retzlaff’s sponsorship was negotiated through a three-year-old NCAA initiative — called 'Name, Image, Likeness,' or NIL — that allows college athletes to profit from their personal brands. It will include a limited run of Retzlaff matzah boxes that won’t be available in stores but will be distributed in a giveaway, as well as social media and video content including Retzlaff and showcasing recipes and holiday traditions. An announcement video features Retzlaff eating and signing sheets of matzah and talking about his Jewish upbringing. Manischewitz declined to share how much it is paying Retzlaff for the deal, which runs from Hanukkah through Passover. (A Washington Post investigation found that many athletes and universities do not reveal specifics of NIL deals.) document.createElement('video'); 'Manischewitz has always been part of my life,' Retzlaff said in a press release. 'I grew up with matzo with peanut butter as my favorite snack, and every Passover, my family and I made matzo pizza together. At Chanukah time our tradition was making potato latkes.' He continued: 'Now, at BYU, I’m able to share these traditions with my teammates. This partnership is about more than football — it’s about creating connections and celebrating Jewish pride in ways I never expected.' In its announcement, Manischewitz, the instantly recognizable kosher food brand founded in Cincinnati in 1888 and known especially for its matzah, highlighted Retzlaff’s involvement in the local Jewish community in Provo, Utah — where BYU is located and where he has wrapped tefillin in the school’s stadium and led the city’s first public Hanukkah menorah lighting. (Last year, the county whose seat is in Provo played an unlikely role influencing Israeli domestic politics.) 'We are so proud to welcome Jake officially into the Manischewitz family this holiday season,' Shani Seidman, the chief marketing officer of Kayco, Manischewitz’s parent company, said in the release. 'He is such an inspiration, and we are honored to support his exciting football career and dream. This partnership represents everything the brand aspires to be — celebrating our heritage and bringing awareness to Jewish food and excellence.' Retzlaff’s agreement with Manischewitz follows in the footsteps of — who else? — baseball Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, who in 1962 invested in a Los Angeles motel that renamed itself 'Sandy Koufax’s Tropicana Motel.' In the decades since, Jewish athletes have struck sponsorship deals big and small, from MLB draftee Elie Kligman’s yarmulke brand deal to WNBA legend Sue Bird’s long-running endorsement deals with Nike and American Express. Retzlaff’s NIL deal was the brainchild of Jewish comedian Eitan Levine, who had been working with Manischewitz on other content projects and pitched the idea to each side. Levine, who makes Jewish sports videos for his own social media profiles, had produced Instagram reels about both Manischewitz and Retzlaff, the latter of which he said received over a million views across platforms. Levine said connecting Manischewitz and Retzlaff felt like the perfect pairing — almost like a shidduch, the Hebrew word for a romantic match. 'First of all, Manischewitz is Jewish, Jewish is Manischewitz,' Levine said in an interview. 'Food is one of the biggest parts of Judaism, arguably bigger than the Torah itself. When you think of Manischewitz, I immediately think of Jewish culture.' As for Retzlaff, Levine said, the quarterback not only has an 'absolutely incredible' story, but he has been shattering Jewish stereotypes along the way. 'I think that he does such a good job at representing Judaism and representing just the positive side of our community,' Levine said. 'There’s not a lot of Jewish football players out there. He’s a DI, 10-win school that’s going to be going to a bowl game. And he’s very proudly and prominently Jewish.' Levine said he went to Provo to film content with Manischewitz and could immediately tell how much BYU fans have embraced Retzlaff, who did not respond to a request for comment, and his story. And as a graduate of Yeshiva University, Levine said he could feel the similarities between the Orthodox Jewish flagship and the Mormon school. 'I was walking around that campus, and there’s very similar energy,' Levine said. 'There is an immediate understanding, or just like a comfortability, between these two groups.' And at the end of the day, Levine said, Retzlaff’s NIL deal provides a feel-good Jewish story at a time when the Jewish community has been hurting. 'This past year has not exactly been great,' Levine said. 'Antisemitism has been spiking to insane degrees. And a lot of the stories that come out about the Jewish community — they’re so few and far between — are they positive? This is a purely positive story, being able to merge Manischewitz, which is a purely positive Jewish brand — no one hates Jewish food — and merging that with Jake, which is a purely positive Jewish story, it just makes complete sense.'

Israel sees record-breaking $10.5 billion in startup acquisitions	While the total number of deals dropped to 434 from 682 in the same period last year, the total amount of funds raised by the startups increased to $8.1 billion, up from $7.3 billion. By Noah Michaeli, TPS More than 200 venture capital partners, investors, and entrepreneurs gathered in Tel Aviv on Thursday for the annual 2024-2025 Trends and Forecasts conference. The conference was spearheaded by Pearl Cohen, a law firm, and Fusion VC, a US-based venture capital firm and accelerator for Israeli startups. It included several surveys and reports on Israel’s startup ecosystem. Israel’s mergers and acquisitions market saw a record-breaking high of $10.5 billion in 2024 – Israel’s best year ever – with Israeli startups securing $8.1 billion in funding, according to a report presented by Asaf Horesh, managing partner at Vintage Investment Partners. This comes amid ongoing economic troubles in Europe and the US and as Israel faces an ongoing, multi- front war. According to the report, while the total number of deals dropped to 434 from 682 in the same period last year, the total amount of funds raised by the startups increased to $8.1 billion, up from $7.3 billion. The fact that the total funds raised for this year have increased despite the decrease in the number of deals means that the companies that did succeed often managed to raise larger sums. According to an investor study by Fusion VC, 43% of respondents cited political and security instability as their top concerns, while 38% emphasized difficulties in raising funds for new VC initiatives. Furthermore, many investors saw attracting foreign investment amid the ongoing war as a critical issue, scaring off potential international investors. 'There is also concern that the Israeli tech ecosystem is overly concentrated in cybersecurity, with too few resources directed toward consumer-focused companies. This limits the potential for Israel to build large-scale consumer businesses,' said Fusion co-founder Guy Katsovich. In addition to reports, surveys, and discussions with leading investors, the conference also featured a discussion with Danny Gold, head of MAFAT (the Directorate of Defense Research and Development and developer of Israel’s famed Iron Dome. Israeli defense technologies have proven their worth on multiple occasions over the past year of war, with Israel’s air defense and cybersecurity drawing increasing interest from foreign buyers and investors.

Syrian rebels capture key city of Hama in fresh blow to Assad	The fall of Hama, which was in government hands throughout the civil war triggered by a 2011 rebellion against Assad, will send shockwaves through Damascus and fears of a continued rebel march south. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Syrian rebels captured the key city of Hama on Thursday, bringing the insurgents a major victory after a lightning advance across northern Syria and dealing a new blow to President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies. The Syrian army said it was redeploying outside the city 'to preserve civilians lives and prevent urban combat' after what it called intense clashes. Rebels said they were preparing to keep marching south towards Homs, Syria’s great crossroads city that links the capital Damascus to the north and coast. 'Your time has come,' said a rebel operations room in an online post, calling on city residents to rise up in revolution. Al Jazeera television broadcast what it said were images of rebels inside Hama, some of them greeting civilians near a roundabout while others drove in military vehicles and on mopeds. The rebels took the main northern city of Aleppo last week and have since pushed south from their enclave in northwest Syria. Fighting has raged around villages outside Hama for two days. The fall of Hama, which was in government hands throughout the civil war triggered by a 2011 rebellion against Assad, will send shockwaves through Damascus and fears of a continued rebel march south. Assad relied heavily on Russian and Iranian backing throughout the most intense years of the conflict, helping him to claw back most territory and the biggest cities before front lines froze in 2020. The collapse of pro-government forces in northern Syria over the past week underlines the problems that alliance has faced since. Russia has been focused on the war in Ukraine since 2022. Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which had been the most potent Iran-backed force in Syria, has suffered heavy losses in its own war with Israel. As his forces swept into Hama, the main insurgent commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani issued a video statement warning against any involvement by the other main regional force that is aligned with Iran — Iraq’s Hashd al-Shaabi militias. Some Iraqi fighters entered Syria early this week to support Assad, Iraqi and Syrian sources said. The Hashd al-Shaabi has mobilized along the border with Syria saying this was purely preventative in case of spillover into Iraq. 'We urge him [Iraq’s prime minister] again to keep Iraq away from entering into the flames of a new war tied to what is happening in Syria,' Golani said. PIVOTAL CITY Hama lies more than a third of the way from Aleppo to Damascus and its capture would prevent any quick attempt by Assad and his allies to launch a counteroffensive against rebel gains of the past week. A rebel advance on Homs, 40km (24 miles) south of Hama, could meanwhile cut Damascus off from the coastal region that is a stronghold of Assad‘s Alawite sect and where his Russian ally has a naval base and airbase. 'Assad now cannot afford to lose anything else. The big battle is the one coming against Homs. If Homs falls, we are talking of a potential change of regime,' said Jihad Yazigi, editor of the Syria Report news letter. Hama is also critical to control of two major towns with big minority religious communities: Muhrada, home to many Christians, and Salamiya where there are many Ismaili Muslims. Although Hama had not previously been taken by rebels during the war, it was historically a center of opposition to the Assad dynasty’s rule. In 1982 Muslim Brotherhood activists rose up in revolt there and the military launched a devastating three-week assault that killed more than 10,000 people and would come to be seen as a model for Assad‘s campaign against the rebels. Golani referred to that bloody episode in his statement, saying 'the revolutionaries have begun entering the city of Hama to cleanse that wound that has persisted in Syria for 40 years.' However, he added that rebels taking Hama would not exact revenge for the events of 1982. ADVANCE The most powerful rebel faction is the militant Sunni Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. Golani, its leader, has pledged to protect Syria’s religious minorities and has called on them to abandon Assad, but many remain fearful of the insurgents. On Wednesday, Golani visited Aleppo’s historic citadel, a symbolic moment for rebels driven out of the city in 2016 after months of siege and intense fighting, their biggest defeat of the war. Aleppo was Syria’s biggest city before the war. HTS and the other rebel groups are trying to consolidate their rule in Aleppo, bringing it under the administration of the so-called Salvation Government they established in their northwestern enclave. Aleppo residents have said there are shortages of bread and fuel, and that telecoms services have been cut. Turkey, which designates HTS as a terrorist organization, has long been the biggest external backer of other rebel factions and its role will be critical to the future of any enlarged insurgent region in Syria. Ankara has denied having any role in the rebels‘ sudden sweep into Aleppo last week. It has maintained a military presence in northern Syria since 2016 and its stance will be critical for any expanded rebel enclave in the north.

Jaffa Port gets Israel’s first wave energy plant	The power plant uses pioneering technology that connects 'floaters' which rise and fall with the waves to existing marine structures such as breakwaters and piers, powering a motor and generator onshore. By JNS Israel’s first wave energy power plant is being inaugurated on Thursday at Jaffa Port, in a push for renewable energy. The city-sponsored pilot project will generate electricity from sea waves, reinforcing Tel Aviv’s status as a global innovation leader. For the first time, electricity generated from sea waves will power Israel’s national grid—a historic milestone in the country’s march toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advancing sustainable energy, the city said.

Egyptian proposal: Israel to pullout of Rafah during 2-month ceas...	While Israel proposes limited deal with Hamas, Egyptian mediators present plan allowing Israel to maintain military presence in most of Gaza Strip, while withdrawing from border city of Rafah. By World Israel News Staff Egyptian mediators have presented a new proposal for a hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire to Israel, allowing the IDF to maintain control of most of the Gaza Strip, Israeli media outlets reported Thursday. While previous proposals were based on President Joe Biden's three-phase framework, which would mandate Israel agreeing to an end to the war and a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the new Egyptian plan would only require a 60-day ceasefire, during which Israel would withdraw from the Rafah area near the Sinai frontier. According to a report by Yedioth Aharanoth, which cited a senior Egyptian official, the new plan would gradually impose a truce in Gaza. After one week, Israeli hostages would be released to Israel, in exchange for the freeing of hundreds of jailed Arab terrorists held in Israeli prisons. The hostage releases would continue through the 60-day truce, while Israel would permit greater access to the northern Gaza Strip, allowing large numbers of residents to return to the area. Under the proposal, the Rafah crossing - a key strategic position on the Gaza-Egypt border and a hotbed of Hamas arms smuggling prior to October 7th - would be transfered from Israeli control to a joint committee established by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. Earlier this week, Hamas and the PA inked a deal to establish a committee of 10-15 non-partisan technocrats to manage the entire Gaza Strip after the current war. The committee is planned to be supervised by representatives from the U.S. While the new proposal does not obligate Israel to accept a permanent end to the war, it would offer a framework for extending the truce and negotiating a full cessation of the fighting, the Egyptian official cited by Yedioth Aharanoth said. The source expressed optimism Hamas will accept the plan, saying the terror group 'is demonstrating a positive attitude.' Israel has reportedly issued a proposal of its own, transmitting the plan to Hamas via Egyptian interlocutors. The ceasefire would be limited to between 42 and 60 days, and would include the release of all female hostages, male hostages over 50, and critically ill captives.

Israeli minister eyes Trump support for population transfer in Ga...	Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir pushing government to present plan to Trump after January 20th, under which Israel would encourage Jewish settlement of Gaza, while enabling voluntary emigration of Palestinian Arabs. By World Israel News Staff A senior Israeli government minister has proposed a two-fold population transfer in the Gaza Strip - and is hoping to garner support from the White House for his plan. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, chairman of the Otzma Yehudit faction and a former activist in the Kach movement founded by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, told Ma'ariv Thursday that is optimistic that the Netanyahu government will accomplish 'big things' in the Gaza Strip, once President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20th. In particular, Ben-Gvir said he hopes Israel will take advantage of the change in the White House to push a pair of policy changes vis-a-vis the Gaza Strip; encouraging Jewish resettlement of the coastal enclave - which Israel evacuated in August 2005 - and promoting the voluntary emigration of Arabs from Gaza to countries abroad. 'I would tell the president to join us in this endeavor,' Ben-Gvir said, calling his 'program to encourage migration and settlements in Gaza' the 'moral' and 'logical' move. 'It will also be good for the residents of Gaza who emigrate, voluntarily of course,' Ben-Gvir continued. 'I think it will also do us good.' 'When have we defeated our enemies? It’s always been when we’ve taken territory from them. When we liberated — they call it ‘occupied’ I say we liberated — the territory, that’s always been the thing that punishes them most.' Ben-Gvir said he was encouraged by Trump's ultimatum, issued earlier this week via his Truth Social account, in which he warned there would be 'hell to pay' if Hamas does not release the remaining 100 hostages by inauguration day. 'At the end of the day, I expect that we will do things, and have the power to do things, that will expedite the return of the hostages.'

Amnesty International under fire over report accusing Israel of G...	Israeli Foreign Ministry castigates 'fanatical' Amnesty International report accusing IDF of 'genocide' in the Gaza Strip, while human rights lawyer blasts report as 'baseless' and distorted. By World Israel News Staff The London-based NGO Amnesty International published a report Thursday accusing Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip, drawing sharp criticism from the Israeli government and Jewish activists. On Thursday, Amnesty International released its report on the war between Israel and the Hamas terror organization, entitled ‘You Feel Like You Are Subhuman’: Israel’s Genocide Against Palestinians in Gaza, accusing Israel of unleashing 'hell and destruction' on the inhabitants of the coastal enclave. 'Amnesty International’s report demonstrates that Israel has carried out acts prohibited under the Genocide Convention, with the specific intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza,' said Amnesty Secretary-General Agnès Callamard. 'These acts include killings, causing serious bodily or mental harm and deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction. Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them.' 'Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now. Callamard called on the United States, Britain, and European Union-member states to halt arms sales to Israel, citing Thursday’s report. 'States that continue to transfer arms to Israel at this time must know they are violating their obligation to prevent genocide and are at risk of becoming complicit in genocide.' Human rights attorney Arsen Ostrovsky, CEO of The International Legal Forum, castigated the Amnesty report, calling it a 'blood libel' against Israel that 'belongs in the dustbin of antisemitic history.' 'Perhaps knowing it doesn’t have a legal leg to stand on, Amnesty has resorted to manufacturing its own definition of ‘genocide’ against Israel, by claiming in their report that the universally established - and sole accepted legal definition - as outlined in the Genocide Convention of 1948, requiring the existence of intent, is an ‘overly cramped interpretation of international jurisprudence and one that would effectively preclude a finding of genocide in the context of an armed conflict,’' Ostrovsky tweeted. 'Really says all you need to know about how absurd and entirely baseless, Amnesty's charge is against Israel.' 'This report, written under the guise of ‘international law and human rights’, is utterly baseless and replete with malicious lies, gross distortions of truth and fabrications of law,' Ostrovsky said. 'To accuse Israel of ‘genocide’ in Gaza is a gross and egregious subversion and weaponization of the very term itself, made even more unconscionable given the October 7 attacks were the largest mass slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust.' The watchdog group NGO Monitor called Amnesty International’s report an 'immoral attack targeting Israel.' The NGO twists and invents legal standards, erases the monstrous Hamas war crimes of October 7, and turns unverifiable accusations into 'evidence'. 'Under the facade of an ‘investigative report,’ this publication and accompanying campaign are timed to reinforce the meeting of the ICC’s Assembly of States Parties as part of the ongoing lobbying to bolster the Prosecutor's pursuit of Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gallant. Amnesty's exploitation of ‘genocide’ is also linked to the NGO's role in lawsuits in the Netherlands and the UK that seek to impose a full arms embargo on Israel,' said NGO Monitor Legal Advisor, Anne Herzberg. 'For over two decades, Amnesty, whose founder Peter Benenson, was a strong supporter of Israel, has repeated false accusations of war crimes, apartheid, and similar labels that are designed to demonize and delegitimize Israel's existence.' Israel’s Foreign Ministry decried Amnesty as 'deplorable and fanatical,' calling Thursday’s report a 'fabrication.' 'The deplorable and fanatical organization Amnesty International has once again produced a fabricated report that is entirely false and based on lies. The genocidal massacre on October 7, 2023, was carried out by the Hamas terrorist organization against Israeli citizens. Since then, Israeli citizens have been subjected to daily attacks from seven different fronts.' 'No Amnesty International, Israel fight against Hamas is not a Genocide, it is the right and duty of a democratic nation when its citizens are being brutally attacked by Jihadist monsters,' tweeted Avi Nir-Feldklein, Israel’s Ambassador to Budapest. 'Your blood libel against Israel is serving those that really committed Genocide.'

French government collapses after National Assembly ousts Prime M...	The motion makes Barnier the shortest-serving prime minister in France’s modern Republic. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon The French government collapsed Wednesday after its lower house of parliament voted to oust Prime Minister Michel Barnier, the Wall Street Journal reported. The National Assembly passed a no confidence motion with 331 votes, above the 288 needed, forcing Barnier and his cabinet to resign. The motion stemmed from widespread backlash over Barnier's efforts to force through an austere budget to fix the country’s growing deficits. In a fractured National Assembly with no majority party, opposition blocs joined forces to remove Barnier, accusing him of imposing austerity measures and neglecting the needs of citizens, according to the Associated Press. The motion makes Barnier the shortest-serving prime minister in France’s modern Republic. President Emmanuel Macron must appoint a new prime minister before key legislative activities, including passing the government’s 2025 budget, can resume. Barnier’s removal follows months of nationwide protests accusing Macron of undermining democratic processes for appointing Barnier in September in a snap election, France 24 reported. Barnier survived a no confidence motion in October. Barnier, in an appeal on national TV ahead of Wednesday’s vote, urged lawmakers to act with 'responsibility' and prioritize 'the country’s best interest.' 'The situation is very difficult economically, socially, fiscally and financially,' Barnier said on Tuesday. 'If the no confidence motion passes, everything will be more difficult and everything will be more serious.' Macron, who insisted he will serve the rest of his term until 2027, is facing pressure from a growing number of lawmakers to resign. Right-wing leader Marine Le Pen, in a speech before the vote, said Macron would 'sacrifice the fate of France because of his vanity.' 'Emmanuel Macron has attacked the foundation walls of the nation for the past seven years,' Le Pen said. 'He alone can pull the country out of the rut it’s in [with his resignation].' Éric Coquerel, head of the National Assembly’s finance committee and a voice for the left-wing New Popular Front, urged Macron to 'listen to the calls for his resignation growing from all sides.' 'Today we are voting to censure your government, but more than anything else, we are sounding the death knell of a mandate: that of the president,' Coquerel said. The last time the National Assembly toppled a prime minister was in 1962, amid the turbulence of Algeria’s war for independence and an assassination attempt on then-president Charles de Gaulle.

Harnessing smartphone data: A new frontier in predicting wildfire...	With over 7 billion smartphones in use globally as of 2024, the sheer volume of data being generated is staggering. By Pesach Benson, TPS Smartphones could become powerful life-saving tools for detecting and forecasting extreme weather events by simply leveraging micro-sensors built into the devices, researchers said on Thursday. Tel Aviv University scientists studying how smartphones can collect environmental data found that data points such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and more are already collected but discarded. Their research, recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, argues that this untapped data can provide valuable insights into conditions that lead to natural disasters. With over 7 billion smartphones in use globally as of 2024, the sheer volume of data being generated is staggering. This dense network of mobile devices has the potential to fill gaps in traditional meteorological data collection, particularly in remote areas where weather stations are sparse or nonexistent. Using data gathered via the WeatherSignal app, the research team developed a method to assess wildfire risks by calculating a key parameter known as vapor pressure deficit [VPD]. This measures the dryness of vegetation, which is determined by air temperature and humidity—two metrics readily available from smartphone sensors. 'In hot and dry atmospheric conditions, plants lose moisture more rapidly, increasing the likelihood of ignition,' explained PhD student Hofit Shachaf, who led the research under the supervision of Prof. Colin Price. 'Our method uses data collected passively from smartphones to calculate VPD over large areas, providing high-resolution insights into wildfire risks.' While the concept is promising, using smartphone data also presents challenges. Individual sensors can produce errors, such as temperature readings skewed by air conditioning or humidity measurements influenced by showers. To address these issues, the researchers calibrated smartphone data against traditional meteorological stations. Once calibrated, they analyzed two significant wildfire events — waves of wildfires in Israel in 2016 and Portugal in 2013. The study found data collected from smartphones showed noticeable VPD anomalies leading up to and during these major fires. 'Even though individual smartphones may have biases, the vast amount of data we can collect helps average out errors and retain useful information,' said Shachaf. The potential applications of this approach extend beyond wildfires. In urban areas, where extreme weather events like floods and heat waves can have devastating impacts, the dense network of smartphones has the potential to provide better spatial coverage than traditional weather stations. The researchers noted that global smartphone coverage has increased 30% in the last five years and that low-income regions lacking meteorological infrastructure could benefit. 'The rapid increase in smartphone use worldwide offers a unique opportunity to enhance early warning systems,' he said. 'Better warnings can mean the difference between a natural hazard and a natural disaster,' said Price.

Report: Israel proposes limited ceasefire and partial hostage dea...	Sources say Hamas may finally be ready to accept a deal, as Israeli negotiators reportedly propose a 42-60 day ceasefire, including freeing of all female captives and male captives over 50. By World Israel News Staff In an effort to break a months-long stalemate in negotiations with the Hamas terror organization, Israel has presented brokers with an updated proposal aimed at securing the release of some of the 100 hostages still held in Gaza and initiating a temporary ceasefire, according to two Israeli officials cited in a report by Axios. The new proposal, discussed in a high-level meeting led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, builds on a previous proposal from August which ultimately failed to break the deadlock between Hamas and Israel. Key adjustments were made in the new proposal to focus on an initial phase of implementation, with Israeli officials citing signs of increased flexibility from Hamas, saying the terror group may now be prepared to make the compromises necessary to achieve a ceasefire agreement. Central to the deal is a potential truce lasting between 42 and 60 days, mirroring terms from earlier discussions. Israel has also proposed the release of all surviving female hostages, all male hostages over the age of 50, and those in critical medical condition. The revised approach accounts for the possibility that some hostages in these categories may no longer be alive, reducing the number of individuals Israel is demanding in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, including those convicted of murder. The updated framework was conveyed to Hamas through Egyptian intermediaries during meetings in Cairo earlier this week, Axios reported. An adviser to Trump told Axios that the incoming administration supports the deal, provided it aligns with Israel's terms. 'The urgency of reaching an agreement cannot be overstated,' the adviser said. Israeli officials remain cautiously optimistic that the adjusted framework could revive talks and lay the groundwork for broader negotiations in the future.

Hezbollah already regrouping, rearming	U.S. and Israeli intelligence officials says that the Iranian terror proxy has likely not been deterred in the long term. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hezbollah is already trying revive and rearm itself, Reuters reported Thursday, citing U.S. intelligence sources. The report said its efforts began even as it was suffering the loss of upwards of 4,000 men, including almost its entire political and military senior echelon, and much of its war materiel during weeks of fighting the IDF in Lebanon, including, according to Israel, much of its rocket arsenal and launchers. It is recruiting new fighters, and will attempt to smuggle in new weapons from neighboring countries, as it is likely not deterred from its desire to pose a long-term threat both to the U.S. and its regional allies, two intelligence officials, one American and one Israeli, told the news agency. In the short term, however, it needs time to recover, and meanwhile has declared that its first priority is to help its Shiite supporters rebuild dozens of villages the IDF destroyed as they were found to be hiding thousands of weapons, terror tunnels, or both, all aimed at Israel. Hezbollah has for years received arms, rockets and missiles from Iran through Syria, besides having its own weapons manufacturing facilities, many of which were destroyed by Israel in what it called 'Operation Northern Arrows,' before a ceasefire went into effect last week. The ceasefire stipulates that Hezbollah is not allowed to rearm, and all senior Israeli officials, both political and military, have stated that they will use all means necessary to enforce the ban. The IDF had often bombed trucks laden with weaponry that were trying to get into Lebanon secretly from Syria even before Hezbollah joined Hamas’ war on Israel a day after the Gazan terrorists’ invasion and massacre of 1,200 people last October 7th. The fellow Iranian terror proxy showed its support mainly by launching some 20,000 missiles, rockets, UAVs, RPGs and anti-tank missiles over the border in the last almost 14 months, killing dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers and causing an enormous amount of property damage. The Israeli air force has also bombed Syrian airports in the past in an effort to deter Iranian arms shipments from getting in, to be used either by their own forces in the country or to be smuggled on to Hezbollah. A senior American official told Reuters that the Biden administration is attempting to put pressure on Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad to restrict Hezbollah’s efforts, calling on regional allies to do the same. On Monday, Reuters reported that Washington has talked to the United Arab Emirates about the possibility of lifting certain sanctions on the Syrian regime if Assad blocks the smuggling routes and distances himself from Iran. Pulling away from the Islamic Republic that has been one of his few strong allies, helping the regime maintain power and regain many areas of the country that had fallen to rebels during a years-long civil war, would seem to be too difficult, especially as some groups have just raised their heads again after a long hiatus, taking Aleppo and now almost completely surrounding the key city of Hama.

Police investigating ‘brazen targeted’ killing of UnitedHealthcar...	Thompson’s wife said on Wednesday that her husband had been receiving threats before he was killed. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Authorities are investigating the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City Wednesday morning, calling it a 'brazen targeted attack,' the New York Times reported. Thompson was shot just before 7 a.m. outside a Midtown hotel where his company was holding an investors meeting. Thompson’s killer escaped on an electric Citi Bike and was last spotted in Central Park, investigators said. The suspect was described as a white male wearing a brown coat and black face mask, and carrying a gray backpack, the New York Post reported. Police said Thompson’s shooter was 'lying in wait' for several minutes. 'Many people passed the suspect, but he appeared to wait for his intended target,' officials added. Thompson’s wife said on Wednesday that her husband had been receiving threats before he was killed. 'There had been some threats,' Paulette Thompson told NBC News over the phone. 'I don’t know details. I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.' New York City mayor Eric Adams (D.) told reporters Thompson’s killing appeared to be a 'targeted murder,' not a random act of violence. 'It seemed to have been clearly targeted by an individual, and we will apprehend that individual,' he said. Authorities have not yet made any arrests.

Qatar rejoins hostage talks as broker – report	Negotiations for hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire reportedly set to return to Doha, as Qatar resumes its role as broker between Israel and Hamas after abandoning talks and expelling Hamas leaders. By World Israel News Staff Qatar is again serving as broker between Israel and Hamas during ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and a deal securing the release of the 100 remaining Israeli hostages, according to a report by Reuters. The Gulf Arab state had acted as a go-between, alongside Egypt, for talks between Israel and Hamas since early on in the war, beginning in 2023, before withdrawing from its role as interlocutor in early November, 2024, after Doha expelled senior Hamas leaders. According to a report by Reuters Wednesday, Qatar has resumed its role as broker, with talks returning to Doha. The report also claimed that Steve Witkoff, special Middle East envoy for the Trump administration, visited Israel and Qatar in late November, meeting with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu. The meetings reportedly took place on November 22nd and 23rd respectively, beginning in Doha. On the 24th, the Qatari premier flew to Vienna to meet with Mossad chief David Barnea, who is leading Israel’s negotiating team in ceasefire talks. Qatar’s Foreign Ministry had announced Tuesday that Doha was still not resuming its role as broker between Hamas and Israel, despite claims by President Joe Biden last week that Qatar would work with Egypt and Turkey in a new bid to secure a hostage deal. However, Prime Minister Al Thani confirmed to Sky News on Wednesday that he had spoken with a Trump official regarding President-elect Donald Trump’s call to achieve a hostage deal before inauguration day, suggesting Qatar has in fact renewed its role as broker.

Trump’s Middle East envoy already working with Israeli, Qatari go...	Steven Witkoff met with Qatari and Israeli prime ministers; U.S. official says he is learning the hostage issue, not negotiating. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump’s new special envoy to the Middle East has already begun to work even though his job only officially begins on January 20, inauguration day, Reuters reported Wednesday night. Steven Witkoff went to Doha and Jerusalem two weeks ago, and met with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the news agency said, citing an informed source. The source said that this is a sign that the Gulf country is back in its mediation role on the hostage issue, after having stepped away earlier in November, saying that 'the necessary seriousness' was missing from both Israel and Hamas to get a deal done. After Witkoff’s discussions with Al Thani, 'Both agreed a Gaza ceasefire is needed before Trump's inauguration so that once the Trump administration takes office it can move onto other issues, like stabilizing Gaza and the region,' the source told Reuters. 'There are plans for a subsequent round of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas to take place potentially in Doha soon, but no specific date has been set,' the source added. The day after meeting Witkoff, Al-Thani flew to Vienna to speak with Mossad head David Barnea. Barnea has been heavily involved in the hostages-for-ceasefire negotiations since they began just weeks into the Israel-Hamas war, sparked last October 7 when the terrorist organization invaded Israel, massacred 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, 96 of whom are still in captivity. Another four, two dead soldiers from 2014’s Operation Protective Shield, and two civilians who wandered into the Strip in 2014 and 2015 and are thought to possibly be alive, are also in Hamas hands, with their return sought as well. An American official said that the Biden administration knows of Witkoff’s meetings and understands that he supports the same kind of agreement that the White House has been pushing for months. The outgoing administration officials involved in the hostage issue have kept the incoming team apprised of what, if anything, is happening, but they are not working directly together, the official noted. Coordination is not necessary because the White House understands Witkoff’s efforts as learning the details of the issue rather than any attempt at negotiating, the official said. Trump just announced on Wednesday that he would have a special envoy specifically for hostage affairs, Abraham Accords negotiator Adam Boehler. An Israeli official told Reuters that Witkoff had also met with families of the hostages when he was in the country. He 'spoke with them about Team Trump's efforts to try and broker the deal before inauguration,' the official said. Trump has spoken very forcefully about the need to release the hostages, even threatening that there would be 'hell to pay' if by January 20 Hamas hasn’t freed the hostages, barely two thirds of them still thought to be alive.

Hamas hid Mohammed Deif’s body after he was killed in an airstrik...	On several occasions, Hamas denied that Deif was dead. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Kan news reported on Wednesday that Palestinian sources said Hamas hid the body of Mohammed Deif, chief of staff of Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades after he was killed in an airstrike in July. The terror group, on several occasions, denied that Deif was dead. Hamas members discovered Deif's body amid rubble following an airstrike in Al-Mawasi and reportedly buried it in secret. The location of Deif's burial is currently undisclosed, and Hamas is secretive about the location of his grave because they fear Israel will dig him up and use the terror commander's body as a bargaining chip amid hostage negotiations. Previously, Hamas did not announce Deif's death or acknowledge that he was deceased because they were concerned news of his demise 'would break the morale of the fighters in the Gaza Strip.' In August, the IDF acknowledged that its July 13 airstrike killed Mohammed Deif. A day after the strike, Hamas claimed that Deif was 'alive and well,' while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly acknowledged Israel was unsure of Deif's condition. A Hamas courier informed Israeli security forces of the location of top Hamas leader Mohammed Deif and assisted with the assassination, as reported by Saudi media outlet Al Arabiya. Mohammed Deif was the number three Hamas leader after the now-dead Ismail Haniyeh and the current head of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, and with these two, planned the October 7 massacre. Citing a 'responsible security source in Hamas,' the Saudi news outlet reported that the Hamas operative was a courier tasked with passing on communications from Hamas's Rafah Brigade commander Muhammad Shabana to other Hamas leaders. Hamas communicated through the low-tech courier system to avoid having digital messages picked up by Israeli security. The informant and courier who assisted with Deif's assassination is being interrogated by Hamas and revealed details of the operation. An Israeli handler showed the informant a photo of Deif and said to tell him if he ever spotted the Hamas leader. The courier notified the Israeli handler of Deif's whereabouts on July 13, and a strike followed based on this information.

Hamas says it will execute hostages if IDF attempts rescue missio...	Israel‘s Nuseirat rescue operation on June 9 saw Israeli forces free four hostages, who had been held by Hamas since October 2023. By Algemeiner and Reuters Staff The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas said it had information that Israel intended to carry out a hostage rescue operation similar to one conducted in Gaza’s Nuseirat camp in June and threatened to 'neutralize' the captives if any such action took place, according to an internal statement seen by Reuters on Wednesday. In the statement dated Nov. 22, Hamas told its operatives not to consider what the repercussions of following the instructions might be and said it held Israel responsible for the fate of the hostages. The statement, which a senior Hamas source told Reuters was circulated to its factions by the intelligence unit of the group’s military wing Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, did not say when any Israeli operation was expected to take place. There was no immediate Israeli response to the statement. On Wednesday, Israeli media cited Defense Minister Israel Katz as saying pressure on Hamas was increasing and this time 'we will really be able to advance a hostage deal.' Israel‘s Nuseirat rescue operation on June 9 saw Israeli forces free four hostages, who had been held by Hamas since October 2023. In the Hamas statement, the group told its operatives to 'tighten' the living conditions of the captives and said this should be done in accordance with instructions issued after the Nuseirat operation. In a section titled 'recommendations,' Hamas also instructed its operatives to 'activate neutralization orders … as an immediate and swift response to any adventure by the enemy.' Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists kidnapped over 250 hostages during their invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. About 1,200 people were killed in the onslaught, and thousands more were wounded. Israel responded with an ongoing military campaign to its south in Hamas-ruled Gaza to free the hostages and dismantle the terrorist group’s military and governing capabilities. Hamas is still holding 101 hostages — including 97 who were kidnapped amid the Oct 7. atrocities, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Israeli-German hostage’s body retrieved from Gaza for burial	Svirsky, 38, a Tel Aviv resident with dual German-Israeli citizenship, was visiting his elderly parents at Kibbutz Be’eri for Shabbat and the Simchat Torah holiday on Oct. 7, 2023. By JNS Israeli security forces retrieved the remains of slain hostage Itai Svirsky from the Gaza Strip, the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) said in a joint statement on Wednesday night. 'In a Shin Bet operation assisted by the IDF, the body of the hostage Itai Svirsky was brought for burial in Israel from Gaza,' the statement said. Svirsky’s family was said to have been informed on Wednesday after forensics determined that the body was indeed that of the captive. Svirsky, 38, a Tel Aviv resident with dual German-Israeli citizenship, was visiting his elderly parents at Kibbutz Be’eri for Shabbat and the Simchat Torah holiday on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists launched the cross-border raid. Both of his parents were murdered by Hamas. On Jan. 16, the kibbutz announced that Svirsky and fellow hostage Yossi Sharabi were killed in captivity. The confirmation came shortly after Hamas released a propaganda video purporting to show their bodies. An estimated 10% of the 1,100 residents who lived in Be’eri were killed in the Oct. 7 attacks, with an equal number of its residents kidnapped during the murder spree and infiltration of Israel’s southern border. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that followed the announcement on Wednesday, 'The heart breaks at the heavy loss of the Svirsky family, which also lost Itai’s parents, Orit and Rafi of blessed memory, who were murdered in Hamas’s deadly attack.' 'We will continue to take determined and relentless action to return all of our hostages, the living and the deceased,' the Israeli leader vowed.

IDF: Hamas likely murdered six hostages in Khan Yunis	Hamas propaganda has repeatedly accused the IAF of killing hostages during the 14-month-long aerial assault on the Gaza terrorist group. By JNS Hamas terrorists likely executed the six Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered from southern Gaza on Aug. 20, the Israel Defense Forces said on Wednesday following a comprehensive probe. While the military said it was not possible to determine with absolute certainty how Yagev Buchshtab, Alexander Dancyg, Yoram Metzger, Avraham Munder, Haim Peri and Nadav Popplewell were killed, their bodies were found with gunshot wounds, unlike their six guards, who are believed to have died in an Israeli Air Force strike in the area. The army probe noted that investigators were unable to conclude when the hostages were shot—before the strike, during it, or after it. However, the IDF believes the six men would not have survived the airstrike regardless. At the time of the Feb. 14 IAF strike, Jerusalem 'had no information, not even a suspicion, that the hostages were in the underground compound or its vicinity,' according to the statement, which stressed that the strike would have been called off 'had such information been available.' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi presented the final findings of the investigation to the families of the slain hostages on Wednesday. 'In this prolonged war, which began on a very difficult day, the mission of returning the hostages alive accompanies us at every moment,' said Halevi. 'The IDF is confident that the combat advances their return, but in the context of combat we have also made mistakes.' Following the death of the six captives, it was decided that any airstrike meeting 'specific criteria' must be preapproved by the IDF Intelligence Directorate’s Headquarters of the Hostages and Missing Persons. Hamas propaganda has repeatedly accused the IAF of killing hostages during the 14-month-long aerial assault on the Gaza terrorist group. Immediately after the six corpses were recovered from the Hamas tunnel over the summer, their families were informed that bullet fragments were discovered in at least some of their remains. The IDF had determined the deaths of five of the captives several weeks earlier, with only Munder presumed alive until the retrieval operation. At the time, then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant hailed the recovery of the hostages’ bodies as a 'daring and dangerous operation in the Hamas tunnels in Khan Yunis.' And on Aug. 31, Israeli forces in Rafah discovered the bodies of slain hostages Carmel Gat, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, Eden Yerushalmi and IDF Master Sgt. Ori Danino. According to examinations conducted by the L. Greenberg National Institute of Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir in Tel Aviv, the six were shot by their captors multiple times at close range days before their bodies’ discovery, indicating that hostages was executed as Israeli forces closed in on their underground location. Reuters cited an internal Hamas document on Wednesday evening as saying that the terrorist group had indications that the IDF was planning the rescue of multiple hostages, similar to the raid that freed Noa Argamani, Andrey Kozlov, Almog Meir Jan and Shlomi Ziv in June. The confidential document, dated Nov. 22, tells terrorist operatives to execute hostages if such an operation takes place and 'not to consider any repercussions of following the instructions.' Jerusalem believes that 97 of the 251 hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023 assault remain in Gaza after 425 days. Hamas is also holding two civilians who entered Gaza in 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed during 'Operation Protective Edge' in 2014.

IAF launches first haredi aircraft maintenance facility	According to the military, it marks a significant step in integrating haredi men into the military while respecting their religious needs. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces has established its first ultra-Orthodox underground aircraft maintenance facility, for the 'Scorpion' Squadron located at the Ramat David Airbase in the Jezreel Valley. A graduation ceremony was held for 26 Haredi soldiers who completed a Level A Technician Course for F-16 maintenance on Tuesday at the technical base in Haifa, the IDF announced on Wednesday. This initiative, supported by the IDF Manpower Directorate and the Tzurim organization, includes accommodations to maintain a religious lifestyle, such as separate housing, strict kosher standards and a synagogue. According to the military, it marks a significant step in integrating haredi men into the military while respecting their religious needs. JNS reported last month that the IDF plans to form the first company of the Hasmonean Brigade, to be made up of ultra-Orthodox soldiers, by Chanukah, which this year starts on Dec. 25. The IDF wants to capitalize on the symbolism. The Hasmonean Dynasty began after the Jews threw off the yoke of Hellenistic rule in the Maccabean Revolt (167 to 141 BCE) against the Seleucid Empire, liberation that the holiday commemorates. Thirty young men passed the first screenings and dozens of others have expressed interest in serving in the brigade. The army is also looking to make haredi soldiers currently serving in noncombat roles into combat soldiers for the brigade.

‘This could redraw the map of the Middle East’: How Assad’s strug...	The dictator's struggles could, however, provide further opening for Israel to deliver a crushing blow on Tehran. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon With Hezbollah decimated, Iran significantly weakened, and Russia preoccupied with its war on Ukraine, Syrian opposition forces enjoyed ripe conditions for the surprise offensive they launched last week. Those forces are closer than ever to deposing dictator Bashar al-Assad, experts told the Washington Free Beacon, emphasizing the Iranian regime's ever-loosening grip on the Middle East. The reignited Syrian war, which has dragged on for 13 years, will pose fresh challenges for the incoming Trump administration as it grapples with a Middle East already inflamed by a year of war between Israel and Iran-backed forces across the region. It is this very conflict, regional analysts and former U.S. national security officials say, that set the stage for Syria’s armed rebel forces to reclaim Aleppo, a key stronghold, and set their sites on the capital city, Damascus. The key player in the coming battle for control of Syria is Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is backing anti-Assad forces and likely played a role in initiating their stunning offensive. These forces are primarily composed of Islamist militias controlled by Hayʼat Tahrir ash-Sham, a U.S.-designated terror group. On the other side is Assad, a brutal dictator who relies on support from Iran and Russia. 'For years, Iran dominated Syria through Assad, but Erdogan saw an opening with a weakened Iran and Hezbollah thanks to Israeli operations,' said Simone Ledeen, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East. 'By supporting Islamist networks, Turkey is pushing to fill the vacuum left by Iran’s decline. This could redraw the map of the Middle East.' Still, Assad's decline would by no means lead to a friendly replacement for the United States. The Syrian conflict is 'the Middle East equivalent of Alien vs Predator,' Foundation for Defense of Democracies analyst Jonathan Schanzer said. 'All of the players are bad actors with terrorist, anti-American, or anti-Israel agendas.' The dictator's struggles could, however, provide further opening for Israel to deliver a crushing blow on Tehran. Iran is reportedly dispatching scores of fighters to Syria to combat the rebel forces, and its air defenses are already decimated thanks to Israel's October counterstrike on the Islamic Republic. Amid the chaos, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu could see an opportunity to strike Tehran again, 'including the nuclear program,' according to former White House national security adviser John Bolton. That option remains 'still on the table,' he said. 'It’s still the regime in Tehran,' Bolton said. 'That’s what the threat is. Assad is a manifestation of that threat.' With Syrian opposition forces now closing in on Damascus following the siege of Aleppo and ensuing battles in other towns, analysts are just beginning to digest how Israel’s war against Hamas and Hezbollah has fundamentally reshaped the region. 'The Israelis have helped change and weaken those players' who back Assad, according to former U.S. ambassador to Syria Robert Ford, who discussed the situation during a Tuesday briefing hosted by the Middle East Institute. Since last week’s march on Aleppo, for example, the Israelis reportedly intercepted an Iranian supply plane heading to Damascus, further underscoring Tehran’s weakened hand. At this early stage in the conflict, Erdogan’s Turkey has the most to gain, potentially extracting territorial concessions from Assad and his Russian allies, according to Bolton. Moscow, however, is chiefly concerned about its two military bases in Syria, which give the Russians leverage over the region. While it’s unclear what Syria will look like in the coming months, one possibility could see Erdogan’s Turkey 'controlling Islamist forces in one part and Russia clinging to an enclave of Christian communities in another,' Ledeen, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense, told the Free Beacon. As the Middle East undergoes monumental shifts, the United States has largely sat on the sidelines. 'One of the most troubling aspects of this moment is that we’re watching tectonic plates shift, yet there’s no visible effort—or even apparent desire—to shape these outcomes to our benefit,' Ledeen said. 'This moment is a test of American resolve, and our adversaries are closely watching. Iran is emboldened, Russia and China are taking notes, and our allies are growing increasingly uneasy.'

Israel begins reopening northern national parks after year-long c...	Teams are still inspecting trails for potential hazards, such as missile debris, and visitors are warned not to touch any suspicious objects they may encounter and to report such findings immediately to the authorities. By Pesach Benson, TPS National parks and reserves in northern Israel began reopening to the public on Wednesday for the first time in a year since Hezbollah rocket barrages forced their closure. 'The opening of the nature sites and parks in the north is an exciting and hopeful moment for all of us. After a difficult year of constant fighting and many challenges, the opportunity to once again travel through the spectacular landscapes of the north is a ray of light of a renewed connection to our nature, land and heritage,' said Environmental Protection Minister Idit Silman. The first wave of reopened sites includes Baram National Park, Hula Nature Reserve, Achziv National Park, Yechiam National Park, Tel Hazor National Park, Nahal Amud Nature Reserve, and Nimrod Fortress National Park. Other sites, such as the Ein Afek and Tel Dan nature reserves, will remain closed for restoration and safety assessments. The reopening is being carried out under Home Front Command guidelines. Teams are still inspecting trails for potential hazards, such as missile debris and visitors are warned not to touch any suspicious objects they may encounter and to report such findings immediately to the authorities. 'Going out to nature reserves and national parks allows us to disconnect from routine and connect with the beauty of Israeli nature,' said Raya Shurki, Director General of the Nature and Parks Authority. Among the sites reopening are the Hula Nature Reserve, known for its wetlands and is popular for birdwatchers. Tel Hazor National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to the ruins of the biblical city of Hazor. Nimrod Fortress National Park, on the slopes of Mount Hermon, features the impressive ruins of a medieval fortress. And Baram National Park, located in the Upper Galilee, features well-preserved ancient ruins of a Roman-era village. But the reopening of the parks is bittersweet for the Authority. One of its workers, Ohad Yahalomi, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz home on October 7. A dual US-Israeli national, Yahalomi turned 50 while in captivity. Fires sparked by the barrages have scorched forests that are home to rare and endangered wildlife. In the 14 months since Hamas’s October 7 attack, Hezbollah fired more than 16,500 rockets, killing 77 people and injuring approximately 757. Wildfires sparked by the barrages burnt around 230 million square meters of land. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel were displaced from their homes.

UN calls for conference to advance Palestinian state	The conference will take place in New York on June 2-4, with a preparatory meeting to be held in May. By JNS The United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday passed a resolution calling for a 'High-level International Conference' to be held in June to push forward the establishment of a State of Palestine. The conference will advance implementation of U.N. resolutions regarding 'the question of Palestine,' reads the resolution, one of three passed on Tuesday concerning the two-state solution. The conference will take place in New York on June 2-4, with a preparatory meeting to be held in May. It will adopt an 'outcome document' that will outline 'an irreversible pathway towards the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution.' The resolution also calls for the convening of an international conference in Moscow, as envisioned by a 2008 Security Council resolution, to bring about the goal of two states as part of 'a just, lasting and comprehensive peace settlement.' The resolution characterizes Israel as an 'occupying power' and demands it end its presence in Judea, Samaria and eastern Jerusalem, what it terms 'Occupied Palestinian Territory,' as reflected in the July 19 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The resolution also demanded that Israel cease all new 'settlement' activities and evacuate all 'settlers' from those areas. The General Assembly resolution was passed with 157 votes in favor, eight against (Argentina, Hungary, Israel, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, United States) and seven abstentions (Cameroon, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Georgia, Paraguay, Ukraine, Uruguay).

Annexation plan not a deal-breaker for Saudi deal, says ex-Trump ...	Deputy National Security Advisor from first Trump administration says president-elect will push new policies vis-a-vis Iran, the Palestinian Authority, and the Abraham Accords. By Anna Epshtein, TPS A former advisor to Donald Trump promised on Monday that the President-elect will change policies towards Iran, the Palestinians and normalization with Arab states. 'Oslo failed. We need a paradigm shift,' said Victoria Coates, former Deputy National Security Advisor during Trump’s first presidency. 'This rigid formula of the two-state solution in the last thirty years has got us nowhere,' Coates insisted. The Oslo Accords of 1993, she said, were 'well-intentioned, but didn’t work.' 'It is Israel’s and Palestinians’ business now to figure out a solution.' Coates was invited by the Jerusalem-based Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy to present her new book The Battle for the Jewish State about Israel-US relations. She speculated that the incoming Trump administration will take a harder line on Iran. 'Trump said after October 1 that Israel should hit Iran’s nuclear and energy sites. This is not something he used to say previously, and I don’t think he said it lightly.' Israel retaliated for Iran’s October 1 missile barrage with airstrikes on the Islamic Republic’s air defenses, missile production facilities and a nuclear research site. Coates also mentioned that the incoming Trump administration will likely harden sanctions on Iran. Asked about possible normalization between Israel and moderate Arab countries, Coates said she believed the Abraham Accords still have the potential to be expanded. 'I would leave the details for negotiations, but it is clear to me that the veto that the Palestinians have held since essentially 1973 over the foreign policy decisions, particularly of our Gulf partners and allies, that veto no longer holds,' Coates said. She added that Israeli sovereignty over parts Judea and Samaria would not necessarily deter Saudi Arabia from normalizing ties. 'I don’t see it as a deal-breaker for Saudi Arabia if it is not a deal-breaker for Washington,' she asserted. 'I would rather pay attention to what the Saudis do than to what they say.' The Abraham accords, signed in September 2021, normalized relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Morocco joined the accords in December. Sudan, which signed the Abraham accords in January 2021, has not made any moves to normalize ties, keeping relations focused on security and intelligence cooperation. Israel and Saudi Arabia were moving closer to normalizing ties before the diplomacy was disrupted by Hamas’s October 7 attack.

Israel headed to civil war if court ousts Netanyahu, minister war...	Israeli government minister David Amsalem warns that attempts by the judiciary to remove Netanyahu from office would spark an Israeli civil war. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli government minister and member of the ruling Likud party warned Wednesday that any attempt by the judiciary to force Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu out of office, including any attempt to declare him incapable of fulfilling his duties as premier, would likely spark violence and possibly even lead to an Israeli civil war. Speaking with Galei Yisrael radio on Wednesday, Regional Cooperation Minister David Amsalem ruled out the possibility of the Supreme Court ousting Netanyahu, saying that public outrage would be overpowering should the judiciary attempt to declare the prime minister unfit to serve. 'That won't happen, we won't let it happen,' said Amsalem. 'I suppose we can make the judges stay clear of such a place and we can do other things so that the public will act spontaneously.' However, should the court attempt to force the issue, Amsalem continued, popular resistance to the move would likely turn violent. 'In my opinion, that already would be a coup d'etat par excellence, and it would lead to a civil war.' When asked whether he would back the use of armed force by citizens in such a situation, Amsalem responded: 'No, not with guns. That would lead to physical confrontations between citizens. Not with guns. That could escalate to that at some later stage.' Amsalem advocated for civil disobedience and protests, should the courts attempt to force Netanyahu out of office. 'It's possible also to do other things, like preventing judges from entering their chambers; people could come and barricade the entrance. You can always escalate to the next stage, and then the next stage after that.'

In major reversal, Australia calls for full Israeli withdrawal fr...	Ending nearly quarter century of policy, Australia backs UN resolution demanding Israel withdraw from all of Judea and Samaria, along with eastern Jerusalem, and establish Palestinian state including Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Australia's mission to the United Nations broke with nearly a quarter center of policy Tuesday night to vote in favor of a United Nations resolution demanding Israel halt all settlement activity in Judea and Samaria, and to withdraw completely from the area, as well as Jerusalem, and to agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state. The resolution was passed in the UN General Assembly Tuesday night by a margin of 157 to 8, with 7 abstentions, with Israel, the U.S., Hungary, and Argentina among the dissenters. Prior to Tuesday's vote, Australia had hitherto refused to back such measures at the United Nations, alternating between abstaining and openly opposing resolutions. From 1996 to 2000, however, the Howard government voted in favor of such measures. The Australian government, under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, refused to back a similar resolution in September, with Australia's delegation abstaining. Now, however, Foreign Minister Penny Wong's office said that Canberra decided to back the measure, believing its vote in favor could 'contribute to peace and a two-state solution.' James Larsen, Australia's ambassador to the United Nations, defended the about-face, calling Palestinian statehood the 'only hope' for peace in the Middle East. 'A two-state solution remains the only hope of breaking the endless cycle of violence – the only hope to see a secure and prosperous future for both peoples.' The decision to back the resolution drew fire from Australian Jewish groups and the center-right Liberal party. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton castigated the move, accusing Prime Minister Albanese of having 'sold out' Australia's Jewish population in favor of far-left voters. Last month, Australia sparked out controversy, and drew criticism from the Israeli government, after it refused to grant an entry visa to former Israeli government minister Ayelet Shaked, citing her stances on the Gaza war and Palestinian statehood.

France, Saudis to spearhead summit pushing for Palestinian stateh...	United Nations votes to call for conference in 2025 to advance Palestinian statehood, with France and Saudi Arabia announcing plans to head up the summit. By World Israel News Staff France and Saudi Arabia will cohost a conference next year aimed at securing a pathway to the establishment of a Palestinian state, French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday night. 'We have decided to co-chair a conference for the two states in June next year,' Macron said Tuesday night. 'In the coming months, together we will multiply and combine our diplomatic initiatives to bring everyone along this path,' he continued. The announcement came shortly after the United Nations General Assembly voted 157 to 8 in favor of a resolution calling for a full Israeli withdrawal from Judea, Samaria, and eastern Jerusalem - including the Old City of Jerusalem - the establishment of a Palestinian state, and a conference at UN headquarters next June to promote Palestinian statehood. A day before the announcement, President Macron met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, during which the two leaders signed a strategic partnership agreement. When asked by reporters Tuesday night whether France would recognize Palestinian statehood unilaterally, Macron responded that his government would recognize a Palestinian state 'at the right moment', 'when it triggers reciprocal movements of recognition.' 'We want to involve several other partners and allies, both European and non-European, who are ready to move in this direction but who are waiting for France.' Macron hinted that he also would reserve recognition for a broader peace deal, possibly one including Saudi Arabia, for Arab recognition of Israel, saying his government hoped to 'trigger a movement of recognition in favor of Israel,' and 'provide answers in terms of security for Israel and convince people that the two-state solution is a solution that is relevant for Israel.'

UN demands Israel withdraw from Old City of Jerusalem, Judea and ...	United Nations General Assembly resolution passed by overwhelming majority calls on Israel to withdraw from all areas captured in 1967, including eastern Jerusalem. By World Israel News Staff The United Nations General Assembly voted to pass a resolution Tuesday night demanding the establishment of a Palestinian state, and Israel's withdrawal from all territories secured in the 1967 Six Day War in Judea, Samaria, and Jerusalem. The measure was passed by a majority of 157 to 8 with 7 abstentions. The United States, Israel, Argentina, and Hungary were among the countries voting against the resolution. Tuesday's resolution includes plans for a 'High-Level International Conference' to be held at UN headquarters in New York next June, with the goal of adopting an 'action-oriented outcome document' paving the way for Palestinian statehood. In the resolution, the UN General Assembly called on Israel to withdraw 'from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem,' and to enable the establishment of a Palestinian state along the pre-1967 Green Line demarcating the 1949 armistice border between Israel and Jordan. Israel is furthermore ordered to halt all 'settlement activities,' and to enter into negotiations with the Palestinian Authority to address final status issues. The resolution cited the July 19th, 2024 ruling of the International Court of Justice, the United Nations official judicial body, which found Israel's presence in Judea and Samaria to be illegal under international law. Turning to Israel's war against the Hamas terror organization, Tuesday's resolution also forbade Israel to encourage mass voluntary Arab emigration, as proposed by several Israeli ministers, and emphasized that the Gaza Strip must be part of a future Palestinian state. The UN rejects 'any attempt at demographic or territorial change in the Gaza Strip, including any actions that reduce the territory of Gaza, stresses that the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the Palestinian territory occupied in 1967, and reaffirms the vision of the two-State solution, with the Gaza Strip as part of the Palestinian State.' The resolution also reiterated the UN's rejection of Israel's application of sovereignty over eastern Jerusalem in 1967.

Hamas, PA officials leave Cairo without agreement on ‘day after’ ...	Senior P.A. official Jibril Rajoub told reporters in Ramallah on Tuesday that he did not favor any agreement to create separate political systems in the Gaza Strip, Judea, and Samaria. By JNS Palestinian Authority and Hamas representatives have left Egypt without signing an expected agreement on joint management of the Gaza Strip after the war with Israel, multiple sources reported on Tuesday night. Earlier on Tuesday, negotiators from both sides told AFP that Hamas and the P.A.’s ruling Fatah Party were close to creating a committee of up to 15 'nonpartisan' Palestinians who would administer the enclave. The officials claimed the plan would follow a truce deal with Jerusalem. The draft agreement, a copy of which was seen by the press agency, states that the committee would administer the Gaza side of the Rafah Crossing with Egypt. However, senior P.A. official Jibril Rajoub was quoted as telling reporters in Ramallah on Tuesday that he did not favor any agreement to create separate political systems in the Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria. 'What committee is this? It is wrong to even discuss this issue,' said Rajoub. 'We want one government, one security apparatus and one unified policy. Any discussion or effort outside of this framework is a mistake.' Meanwhile, a Palestinian source familiar with the talks told Sky News Arabia on Tuesday evening that 'there are still obstacles to signing the agreement, including the ‘security file’ and the crossings of Gaza.' The source claimed that Hamas is trying to ensure that members of both its civil and military apparatus would continue to receive salaries after the P.A.-led committee assumed control of the coastal enclave. The delegations, led by Turkey-based Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya and Fatah Central Committee member Azzam al-Ahmad, reportedly left to formulate their responses to the Egyptian draft. An Egyptian source had previously claimed that Hamas was willing to accept that it would not be the sole ruler in Gaza, in light of Cairo’s demand that P.A. control be restored to advance a possible two-state solution. On Sept. 25, P.A. Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa announced that Fatah had agreed to sit down with Hamas in Egypt. Mustafa said the discussion would focus on forging initial deals 'to arrange the situation' in Gaza. He expressed his 'readiness to administer the Gaza Strip the day after the war without excluding anyone,' local media reported. In July, Hamas and Fatah announced a unity deal following talks in Beijing. The declaration was approved by 14 terrorist factions that took part in negotiations hosted by Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister. 'Today, we sign an agreement, and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity,' Hamas official Musa Abu Marzouk said at the time. 'We are committed to national unity, and we call for it.' The U.S. State Department, which has been pushing for P.A. control over the Strip after the war, has rejected a government that includes Hamas. 'Hamas has long been a terrorist organization. They have the blood of innocent civilians—both Israeli and Palestinian—on their hands,' State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters in Washington in July. 'There can’t be a role for a terrorist organization.' Secretary of State Antony Blinken has insisted that an 'effective and revitalized Palestinian Authority' should govern Gaza—a move that Israel rejects because of Ramallah’s overt support for terrorism. Jerusalem vehemently rejects Hamas and P.A. rule over the Strip, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu favoring a transfer of control to local bodies not considered hostile to the Jewish state. Netanyahu said during an interview that aired on May 9 that Israel is seeking to establish a rule 'by Gazans who are not committed to our destruction, possibly with the aid of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and other countries that I think want to see stability and peace.' According to recent polls of Palestinian public opinion, 89% of Palestinians support establishing a government that includes or is led by Hamas. Only 8.5% said they favor an authority that is controlled exclusively by the Fatah faction.

Ancient agricultural innovation offers hope for future sustainabi...	SGHAS systems offer a low-impact approach to farming that aligns with contemporary goals of environmental stewardship and climate resilience. By Pesach Benson, TPS As the world grapples with escalating water scarcity and food insecurity, a groundbreaking study led by Bar-Ilan University and the Israel Antiquities Authority released on Wednesday has uncovered sustainable agricultural techniques from the early Islamic period that may hold the key to a more resilient future. The research focuses on traditional sunken groundwater-harvesting agroecosystems (SGHAS), which were once prevalent in regions such as Israel, Iran, Algeria, Egypt, Gaza, and the Atlantic coast of Iberia. Combining geospatial analysis, archaeological evidence, and historical documentation, the study reveals how these innovative systems harnessed limited water resources and enriched sandy soils to sustain agriculture in arid environments — a model that the researchers say remains relevant today. The practical applications revolve around simply leveraging ancient agricultural methods to address modern challenges of water scarcity, soil degradation, and food insecurity. At the heart of the study is the Plot-and-Berm (P&B) agricultural method, developed during the late 9th to early 12th centuries along Israel’s Mediterranean coast. These systems utilized shallow groundwater in conjunction with rainfall to irrigate crops, while organic materials and urban refuse were used to enhance the fertility of sandy soils. This enabled the cultivation of water-intensive crops like dates, watermelons, and grapes in otherwise barren regions. Although P&B systems were abandoned in Israel after the Crusader conquest, similar techniques have persisted in other regions, such as Iran, Algeria, and parts of Iberia. 'The early Islamic agroecosystems were ahead of their time, blending advanced soil-enrichment techniques with efficient water usage. While we lack direct records of their crops or motivations, the ingenuity of these systems remains a powerful lesson in sustainable agriculture,' said the study’s co-leader, Prof. Joel Roskin of Bar-Ilan. The findings suggest that such methods could be adapted to modern socio-economic and environmental contexts, particularly in areas facing expanding populations and diminishing water supplies. The study noted the potential of SGHAS as a sustainable alternative to resource-intensive industrial farming. Unlike modern systems that often deplete soil quality and overuse water resources, these traditional techniques promote ecological balance and long-term viability. By relying on rainfall-replenished groundwater, SGHAS systems offer a low-impact approach to farming that aligns with contemporary goals of environmental stewardship and climate resilience. They also foster community engagement, as such methods often require local expertise and collective management. 'Traditional methods cannot replace industrial farming entirely but provide invaluable lessons for creating locally adaptive, sustainable food systems,'* said Dr. Itamar Taxel of the Israel Antiquities Authority.

Trump to prioritize hostage release, pressure on Iran, Saudi peac...	The new president still actively wants to achieve peace in the region, says new Middle East adviser Massad Boulos. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump is still interested in achieving peace in the Middle East using ideas from his first administration, such as putting maximum pressure on Iran and expanding the Abraham Accords, but the first order of business is to free the 101 Hamas hostages, his new Middle East adviser said in an interview Tuesday. Speaking to French paper Le Point, Massad Boulos said, 'The president believes that the hostages must be released immediately and that there must be no further delay. According to him, their fate should not be linked to other issues related to the ‘day after’ in Gaza.' The deal should come on the basis of a temporary ceasefire, he added. This idea would put Trump squarely on the Israeli side of the on-again, off-again negotiations with Hamas. One of Hamas’ most entrenched demands has been that any agreement with Israel be contingent on the IDF permanently and wholly withdrawing from the Strip. Jerusalem has consistently rejected this due to its security concerns. Boulos mentioned several countries that 'are currently helping to achieve this goal, whether it is Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, or even Turkey.' Turkey has been thrown into the mix because it now has more influence over Hamas, considering that it took over from Qatar as host to the terror organization’s leaders in recent weeks, he noted, although Doha should remain the chief mediator in the negotiations. Qatar has supplied Hamas with billions of dollars over the years, giving it a cudgel it has yet to use in over a year of warfare. In the larger picture, aimed at establishing peace in the region, the Lebanese-American businessman said that Trump will prioritize the resumption of 'discussions on the Abraham Accords, with, of course, Saudi Arabia first. Because we know very well, and the president has said so, that once we reach an agreement with Saudi Arabia on Israel, there will be at least twelve Arab countries that will be immediately ready to follow suit.' According to Boulos, the Saudis were not demanding the establishment of a Palestinian state in order to normalize relations with Israel. This view seems somewhat at odds with statements coming from the royal family as the war has progressed. The de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said in September that 'the kingdom will not stop its tireless work towards the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and we affirm that the kingdom will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that.' In terms of Iran, Boulos stated that Trump will reinstate his firm line against the Islamic Republic. While negotiating on the nuclear issue was an option, he said, 'maximum pressure' would be brought to bear as 'there are three very important points for him: Iran must absolutely not have nuclear power; Iran's ballistic missiles pose a risk not only to Israel, but also to the Gulf countries; and finally, the problem posed by Iranian proxies in the region, whether in Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq or Yemen.' Boulos became close to Trump after his son Michael’s 2022 marriage to Tiffany Trump, the only child from Trump’s second marriage, to actress Marla Maples. The billionaire became an integral part of Trump’s campaign for president by doing outreach to the American Muslim and Arab communities. He has reportedly served in recent months as the main conduit between Trump and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, arranging, according to Axios, the first phone call between the two after Trump was re-elected.

IDF fears that soldiers who fought in Gaza face arrest abroad	The Israeli military is concerned that soldiers may be detained or face prosecution in foreign countries. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli army is concerned that IDF soldiers who recently fought in Gaza may be arrested while traveling abroad, and is taking steps to prevent soldiers from visiting countries where they could potentially be detained. Following the ICC arrest warrants issued against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ex-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza, numerous anti-Israel organizations have stepped up their campaign against Israeli soldiers. The pro-Hamas Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) regularly stalks Israeli soldiers online, revealing their full names and posting their photos to its X account when they travel outside of Israel. The HRF then encourages the governments of the countries where IDF soldiers are visiting to arrest them, citing their supposed complicity in alleged human rights violations. Recently, the HRF claimed that it 'filed a formal complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC)' against an Israeli soldier who was traveling in another country, including the man's full name and photograph was included in the post. The HRF then demanded that the government of the country where the soldier was traveling arrest him, due to his alleged involvement in 'genocide' and 'crimes against humanity.' While some may dismiss the posts as unsophisticated public shaming, the Israeli army takes the matter seriously, and is concerned that soldiers may be detained or face prosecution in foreign countries. According to a report from Hebrew language outlet Ynet, recent weeks have seen a number of incidents in which IDF soldiers traveling outside of the country were doxxed (had their personal details exposed) by anti-Israel groups. Ynet reported that the military was so concerned over potential legal ramifications that it provided special assistance to the soldiers, ensuring they could leave the countries and return to Israel s quickly as possible. Although IDF soldiers are not officially banned from leaving Israel, they are required to inform the military of their destination country prior to traveling abroad. The army then performs a risk assessment, taking into consideration anti-Israel laws in said countries, before approving or denying the travel.

ICC sexual harassment probe marred by conflict of interest	The UN agency, which is expected to investigate the sexual harassment claims against ICC prosecutor Karim Khan, employed his wife for two years. By World Israel News Staff The announcement of a probe into alleged sexual harassment by the International Criminal Court's head prosecutor has raised concerns over a possible conflict of interest, as the agency expected to investigate the claims has extensive ties to the prosecutor's wife. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan groped a female aide on multiple occasions, 'sexually touching her' on a work trip and knocking on the door of her hotel room at 3 a.m., according to the account of the alleged victim. The female ICC staff member refused to cooperate with an internal ICC investigation into the matter, saying that she believed the investigation was designed to exonerate Khan and that she did not want to lend legitimacy to the biased process. According to an AP report, Päivi Kaukoranta, a Finnish diplomat, said last week that Khan would be investigated by the U.N.'s Office of Internal Oversight Services. That decision has raised serious concerns over whether the body could be objective, as Khan's wife, Dato Shyamala Alagendra, worked for that agency for two years. Notably, Alagendra - also an attorney - investigated sexual harassment claims as part of her work with the agency. Two human rights groups, the International Federation for Human Rights and Women’s Initiatives for Gender Justice, issued a joint statement urging that Khan be suspended while the allegations are investigated and questioning the choice of the UN agency to investigate. The groups called for 'thoroughly vetting the chosen investigative body, firm, or institution to ensure it is free from conflicts of interest and possesses demonstrated expertise.' They also stressed that Khan's 'close relationship' with the agency was problematic, and that concerns over conflict of interest be 'openly and transparently addressed' before the agency is officially tasked with handling the investigation against him. Although the ICC officially maintains a zero-tolerance policy on sexual harassment, many employees feel there is a culture of impunity within the organization for senior employees. In 2020, external investigators wrote a report about predatory behavior by senior staff towards female employees. 'There is a general reluctance, if not extreme fear, among many staff to report any alleged act of misconduct or misbehavior' by senior officials, read the report. 'The perception is that they are all immune.'

Google worried by backlash over Israeli gov’t contract	A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company's services to Israel were not used for military purposes. By World Israel News Staff Tech titan Google fretted that agreeing to provide cloud services to the Israeli government would damage its reputation, and those concerns have been exacerbated by recent employee protests over the contract, according to a new report from the New York Times. In 2021, Google announced Project Nimbus, an ambitious initiative aimed at transitioning many Israel government ministries' databases to the cloud. The seven year deal is worth $1.26 billion, with a large portion of that money - $528 million - coming from Israel's Defense Ministry. While publicly Google has claimed that it has no qualms about partnering with Israel, documents recently obtained by the Times revealed that Google's senior leadership were worried that the deal would create negative publicity for the technology giant. According to a risk assessment document prepared by Google's lawyers and external consultants before the deal was signed, advisors feared that the inclusion of Israel's Defense Ministry and the Israeli Security Agency could prove problematic. 'Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations' read the document, which was viewed by the Times. A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company's services to Israel were not used for military purposes. 'We have been very clear that the Nimbus contract is for workloads running on our commercial cloud by Israeli government ministries, who agree to comply with our terms of service and acceptable use policy,' she said. Anti-Israel activism by Google employees has been ongoing since the deal was signed in 2021. In April 2024, Google fired 28 employees who staged raucous sit-ins at the company's Sunnyvale and New York offices. The demonstrators, who refused to leave CEO Thomas Kurian's office, were participating in a 'No Tech for Genocide Day of Action.' 'They took over office spaces, defaced our property, and physically impeded the work of other Googlers,' the company’s vice president of global security, Chris Rackow, wrote in a company-wide memo. 'Their behavior was unacceptable, extremely disruptive, and made co-workers feel threatened.'

EXCLUSIVE: The fierce battle to protect Montreal’s Jewish communi...	While Montreal burned, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was notably absent from the crisis, attending a Taylor Swift concert. By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News Montreal is no stranger to antisemitism, but since October 7, the hostility against Jewish communities has reached alarming levels. From violent protests targeting synagogues and Jewish-owned businesses to direct threats of physical harm, the environment for Jews in Montreal has become increasingly dangerous. Anti-Israel protest near Mcgill University, Montreal, Canada. (Screenshot/Facebook) Yet, amidst the chaos, Jewish leaders, students, and activists are responding with resilience, legal action, and a firm commitment to their identity. At the forefront of this fight for justice are individuals like Michael Hollander, a commercial lawyer who has coordinated high-profile cases to defend Jewish institutions; Neil Oberman, a lawyer and the Conservative candidate for Mount Royal who has represented key cases in court; and Ysabella Elisheva Hazan, a young law graduate and activist advocating for open dialogue in the face of intimidation. Together, they represent a community fighting not only for its safety but for its right to exist unapologetically. A City at Boiling Point The rise in antisemitism in Montreal is no longer confined to rhetoric—it’s spilling into the streets. On November 29, a man entered a Jewish-owned business and shouted a tirade of threats, declaring, 'We’re gonna kill you one by one!' The incident was caught on video, and while a police report was filed, no arrests have been made. Anti-Israel protestor setting fire to effigy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during anti-Israel riot in Montreal, Friday, November 22, 2024 (Nioh Berg/X) This incident follows a violent pro-Palestinian riot in Montreal, where demonstrators set fire to an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, smashed store windows, and torched vehicles. These events are far from protests—they are hate-fueled rallies that incite violence. While Montreal burned, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was notably absent from the crisis, attending a Taylor Swift concert. His presence at the concert sent a starkly different message to the Jewish community and to Canadians at large about the priorities of the country’s leadership during a moment of rising tension and violence. Although Trudeau condemned the riots days later, stating, 'Acts of antisemitism, intimidation, and violence must be condemned wherever we see them,' his earlier statement that he would arrest Netanyahu if he visited Canada undermined his credibility. For many, these mixed messages embolden antisemitic actors who view Jewish identity as inseparable from the Jewish state. The Legal Battle: Protecting the Community As antisemitic hostility mounts, Michael Hollander has taken on a central role in coordinating legal protections for Montreal’s Jewish institutions. Montreal4Palestine poster at McGill (Courtesy) Hollander and Neil Oberman collaborated on obtaining an injunction to protect Federation CJA, Montreal’s largest Jewish organization, after hostile groups including Montreal4Palestine, Independent Jewish Voices, and the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) laid siege to its building on March 4, 2024. Protesters blocked the doors for hours, vandalized the property, assaulted attendees, and chanted, 'Death to the Jews.' The injunction, which Oberman represented in court, was later expanded to protect 27 Jewish institutions, including synagogues, schools, and community centers. These institutions now have a 50-meter buffer zone, offering a measure of safety from similar attacks. Hollander played a key role in coordinating efforts to ensure legal action was effective and consistent throughout this period. 'These aren’t protests—they are literal hate rallies meant to intimidate and silence,' Hollander explained. 'In 2024, Jews shouldn’t have to navigate this level of hostility just to attend school or synagogue.' The Legal Climate in Montreal Despite these challenges, Hollander noted that the courts have been largely receptive to cases addressing antisemitism. 'The courts have consistently shown they are ready to come to the aid of those who need it,' he said. However, he emphasized that obstacles often stem from administrative bodies and inconsistent enforcement of laws. 'Institutions like the Human Rights Commission have proven ineffective in addressing these issues,' Hollander explained. 'It’s not the courts that fail us—it’s the inconsistent application of the law by those tasked with upholding it.' Notable Moments in the Fight Hollander shared several pivotal moments from his work: • At the Spanish &#038; Portuguese Synagogue, Hollander coordinated efforts while Oberman represented in court to secure protections against another planned hate rally targeting the synagogue. • Deposing individuals from hate groups revealed their unwillingness to acknowledge the humanity of Jewish people, with one leader refusing to even shake his hand. • Supporting a Muslim student who faced threats for defending Jewish classmates underscored the shared stakes in combating hatred and extremism. 'These moments remind me how crucial our legal system is,' Hollander reflected. 'The stakes are not just about individual safety—they are about the community as a whole.' A Call for Leadership and Lawful Governance McGill University in Montreal (Shutterstock) As the challenges facing Jewish students and communities continue to mount, Neil Oberman, a lawyer and the Conservative candidate for Mount Royal, has emphasized the urgent need for decisive leadership at every level of government and within institutions. Oberman articulated his stance, stating: 'It is imperative that university administrators prioritize the safety of their students during their educational pursuits. There must be a strict zero-tolerance policy for any form of hatred or aggression on campus. My colleagues and I are committed to reinstating law and order in Montreal, as a secure environment is essential for effective learning.' He pointed to ineffective leadership at municipal, federal, and institutional levels as a key contributor to the rise in campus hostility, adding: 'In a society that values freedom and democracy, individuals should not feel apprehensive about leaving their homes, attending classes, or utilizing public facilities.' Oberman further outlined his vision for addressing these issues after the upcoming election cycle: 'Alongside Pierre Poilievre and the Conservative Party of Canada, we aspire to rejuvenate our nation after nine years of Liberal-NDP governance that has weakened our fundamental institutions and distorted public perceptions of Canada.' Oberman stressed that the current challenges are rooted in longstanding issues that predate the October 7th crisis. He criticized Ottawa’s ineffective leadership, stating that mixed messages from the federal government have sown confusion and allowed extremists to exploit the lack of clarity to propagate hateful ideologies. 'Such behavior will no longer be tolerated under a Conservative Party administration,' Oberman affirmed. 'Our communities cannot thrive if individuals driven by hate impede others from living freely each day. Only through collaboration with responsible Canadians and reforming our institutional frameworks can we hope to restore safety across Canada.' A Collective Stand Against Antisemitism Thousands of Jews gather in Montreal for the 'March for Jerusalem.' (Twitter Screenshot) Recognizing the need for broader community assistance, Hollander and a few colleagues helped establish the Quebec Legal Jewish Alliance. Comprising 300 lawyers, this organization provides legal services for less high-profile but equally critical cases. It assists students, teachers, employees, and others in Montreal who face antisemitism but may not have the resources to consult a lawyer. 'There’s a high volume of incidents in Montreal right now,' Hollander said. 'The Alliance steps in where individuals might otherwise feel powerless.' Oberman also represented two Jewish students at McGill University in a case against the McGill Encampment. While the case was ultimately unsuccessful, it underscored the extent of hostility faced by Jewish students on campus. Hollander continues to provide support on related issues and highlighted his ongoing lawsuit against Concordia University, which underscores the institutional failure to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence. Advocating for Dialogue: Ysabella Hazan’s Perspective While Hollander focuses on legal advocacy, activists like Ysabella Elisheva Hazan are addressing antisemitic narratives in the public sphere. A law graduate and founder of Decolonized Judean, an empowerment movement, Hazan has become a vocal advocate for Jewish empowerment and open dialogue. Hazan was scheduled to speak at an event at McGill University alongside Mosab Hassan Yousef, also known as the 'Son of Hamas.' However, after significant opposition and even death threats, McGill canceled all in-person events for the remainder of the year. While the event never took place, Hazan’s message remains clear: dialogue and resilience are the antidotes to suppression. 'Anti-colonial tactics of resistance won’t work on Jews, an indigenous people to Israel,' Hazan explained. 'The sooner this is understood, the quicker we can create meaningful dialogue and reduce polarization.' A Call to Action The resilience of Montreal’s Jewish community serves as a powerful reminder of the strength that comes from unity and determination. The fight against antisemitism requires more than legal victories or public advocacy—it demands a cultural shift. As Trudeau partied at a concert while Montreal burned, the question remains: will Canada rise to protect its Jewish citizens, or will it allow this wave of hatred to grow unchecked? For now, the Jewish community in Montreal continues to fight—with the courts, with their voices, and with their unwavering commitment to their identity. This is not just a battle for survival—it is a fight to affirm their place as equal members of Canadian society.

Hostage families thank Trump for his robust ultimatum demanding r...	The Hostages and Missing Families Forum: 'It is now evident to all: the time has come. We must bring them home NOW.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Hostages and Missing Families Forum praised US president-elect Donald Trump for saying that there would be 'hell to pay' if the hostages aren't release by the time he takes office on January 20. 'The Hostage Families Forum extends its gratitude to President-elect Trump for his clear and uncompromising message. It is now evident to all: the time has come. We must bring them home NOW,' the forum said. 'We call on both the current and incoming US administrations to act without delay and exhaust every opportunity to bring all the hostages home—those alive for rehabilitation, and those murdered for proper burial.' On Monday, Donald Trump demanded that all hostages be released by the time he takes office on January 20, or there would be 'Hell to pay.' 'Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World in the Middle East – But it's all talk and no action!' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Monday. 'Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released before January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!' Trump wrote. During a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed appreciation for US President-elect Donald Trump's ultimatum that all hostages in Gaza must be released by January 20. Netanyahu said, 'This is a powerful statement, clearly placing responsibility for the situation on one party—Hamas. Trump rightly focused the blame on Hamas, rather than on the Israeli government, which is often the focus in other discussions.'

Hamas agrees to post-war plan that would put Gaza under US superv...	The plan proposed the Gaza be ruled by a committee of 10 to 15 members with US supervision. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Tuesday, a Qatari newspaper published a proposal that Hamas is willing to discuss that involves a committee controlling Gaza after the war and supervised by the United States, Ynet reports. The paper printed the 'Community Support Committee for the Management of the Gaza Strip' document, which proposes a committee to oversee Gaza after the war under US supervision. Following discussions between Hamas and Fatah in Cairo last Saturday, it was proposed that a committee of experts would govern Gaza with the supervision of US officials. The plan, which Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas has not yet approved, would include a committee in charge of health, the economy, education, agriculture, essential services, and the ongoing reconstruction efforts. The structure includes a committee of 10 to 15 members chosen for integrity and transparency. At the head will be a president, a vice president, and officials who will specialize in education, health, economic issues, local governance, reconstruction, and communication with foreign entities. In addition, an official will be responsible for oversight of the Rafah border where Hamas smuggled weapons into Gaza leading up to the war. If Hamas officially approves the proposal, it would mark a dramatic change from the terror group's former insistence on having complete control over Gaza and its rejection of agreements involving cooperation with international entities. The proposal is reminiscent of the ceasefire in Lebanon, which has international oversight of the southern region. However, such a proposal may fall short of Israel's goal of eliminating Hamas, and Israel may want military control over areas of Gaza, particularly the Philadelphi corridor, as articulated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu has declared that Israel must control this nine-mile-long line or else Hamas will easily rearm, rebuild, and become a new 'existential' threat to the Jewish state within a few years' time. Most of the Israeli public agrees that holding the Corridor is of utmost importance to Israel's security.

Internal analytics showed Harris locked in a dead heat with Trump in Wisconsin at 47-47, while trailing in Pennsylvania, where Trump held a slim 48-47 advantage. By Jewish Breaking News A candid post-campaign revelation from a senior Harris advisor has cast new light on the stark realities the Democratic campaign faced throughout the presidential race. Speaking on Monday’s Pod Save America podcast, senior advisor David Plouffe disclosed that internal polling never showed Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in key battleground states, contradicting some public polls that had suggested otherwise. Internal analytics showed Harris locked in a dead heat with Trump in Wisconsin at 47-47, while trailing in Pennsylvania where Trump held a slim 48-47 advantage. 'I mean, I think it surprised people because there were these public polls that came out in late September, early October, showing us with leads that we never saw,' Plouffe said. 'I think we were, you know, we were hopeful. I don’t know how optimistic we were, but we thought, okay, this is tied.' Even moments that seemed to promise a breakthrough proved less impactful than hoped. The campaign’s widely praised debate performance in the mainstream media barely moved polling numbers. 'I think even after the debate, we might have gained what, 0.5%. It wasn’t a race that moved a lot,' Plouffe admitted. Plouffe, who previously steered Barack Obama’s successful 2008 and 2012 campaigns, pointed to challenges in securing independent voters across crucial battleground states. He also defended the campaign’s strategy of partnering with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, arguing it was essential for broadening their appeal beyond the Democratic base. Following her resounding defeat to Trump, Harris maintained an optimistic public stance after returning from a recent trip to Hawaii. In a video released on social media by the Democratic National Committee, she acknowledged the outcome while celebrating raising $1 billion in campaign finances. 'The outcome of this election obviously is not what we wanted. It is not what we worked so hard for. But I am proud of the race we ran, and your role in this was critical. What we did in 107 days was unprecedented,' she said. 'I just have to remind you, don’t you ever let anybody take your power from you. You have the same power that you did before November 5th.'

Israel faces post-war ‘mental health tsunami,’ experts warn	The national suicide prevention program has been allocated a budget of 15.7 million shekels ($4.3 million) for 2024, with an additional two million ($550,000) secured following Health Committee efforts. By TPS The mental health of Israelis took center stage at the Knesset Health Committee on Tuesday as lawmakers were told of a sobering 40% rise in calls to crisis and mental health centers over the past year. While official data indicates no immediate spike in suicides during the war, experts warned of a potential surge as the nation transitions back to normality. 'It is about human life,' said committee chairman MK Yoni Mashriki. 'We must reach out to those on the brink, morally and socially.' He praised the addition of funds to the national suicide prevention program but stressed the need for further investment, particularly in Ministry of Education programs. Miri Cohen, director of government relations and national programs at the Ministry of Health cited data showing approximately 400-500 suicides annually in Israel, alongside 7,000 reported suicide attempts that reach emergency rooms. However, she cautioned that underreporting remains a significant issue, as some suicides are recorded under other causes of death. The national suicide prevention program has been allocated a budget of 15.7 million shekels ($4.3 million) for 2024, with an additional two million ($550,000) secured following Health Committee efforts. Cohen outlined extensive efforts across government ministries, non-profits, and local authorities, including collaborations with health funds, training thousands of therapists, and supporting bereaved families. Prof. Gil Salzman, chairman of the National Council for Suicide Prevention, warned of a 'mental health tsunami' as the nation grapples with the aftermath of war. He called for urgent measures, including stricter firearm regulations, increased caregiver resources, and enhanced funding for suicide prevention programs. Studies have shown such programs to be effective in reducing suicide rates, he said. The psychological impact extends to vulnerable populations, including families of abductees, who have received little to no mental health support. Representatives from various sectors echoed concerns about long wait times for mental health services and the stigma surrounding seeking help. Michal Englert, director of the Educational Psychology Division at the Ministry of Education, outlined efforts to bolster resilience and identify at-risk children through the Education Ministry’s 'Vacharat Haim' program. Each year, 3,550 educational counselors receive training, and 5,000 ninth-grade students participate in the program. However, Raz Gorotsky from the student council warned about late diagnoses and insufficient numbers of educational counselors. In the military, Lt. Col. Carmel Kella highlighted initiatives to address soldiers’ mental health, including treatment centers for regular and reservist troops, pre-combat mental preparation, and post-combat debriefing. A dedicated training course has been developed to help military personnel recognize signs of distress. Civil society organizations have also stepped in to fill gaps in the system. Hagai Harmesh, CEO of 'For the Life,' emphasized the urgency of reducing wait times for mental health appointments and addressing societal prejudices against seeking help. Y ehuda Tanuri Liman of Maccabi Healthcare noted that the organization has expanded its mental health workforce and integrated technologies for self-help and continuity of care.

Two said to be killed in IDF drone strike on terror cell in Jorda...	Israeli forces stormed a nearby hospital following the drone strike and prevented ambulances from reaching the terrorists. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces carried out a drone strike on an armed terrorist cell near the village of Aqaba in the Jordan Valley on Tuesday, resulting in two fatalities, according to Palestinian reports. Members of the cell were en route to carry out an attack, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. The Palestinian Authority’s official WAFA news outlet reported that Israeli forces stormed a nearby hospital following the drone strike and prevented ambulances from reaching the terrorists. Aqaba is located near Jenin in northern Samaria, an area currently experiencing heightened terrorist activity. The Israeli military carried out a drone strike against a Palestinian terrorist cell near Jenin on Sunday morning, killing a Hamas operative responsible for a deadly shooting in the Jordan Valley last summer. Three other terrorists were eliminated in the attack, who according to the IDF had carried out several shootings against Israeli communities in the Gilboa area. In a joint statement on Nov. 27, the IDF and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) revealed that Israeli security forces had recently thwarted an attempt by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to smuggle heavy weaponry to Palestinian terrorist cells in Jenin. On Nov. 24, Israeli forces killed two Palestinian terrorists in the town of Ya’bad, 12 miles west of Jenin in northern Samaria, according to WAFA. In the first six months of 2024, Judea and Samaria saw more than 500 Arab terrorist attacks each month on average, according to data made public by Hatzalah Judea and Samaria (Rescuers Without Borders). During that period, first responders recorded 3,272 acts of terrorism in the region, including 1,868 cases of stoning, 456 fire bombings, 299 incidents involving explosives and 109 shootings. Terrorists murdered 14 people and wounded more than 155 others in Judea and Samaria between January and July, the rescue group said.

South Korean president declares emergency martial law to eradicat...	The Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, 'paralyzed state affairs and turned the National Assembly into a den of criminals,' South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in an unscheduled TV address Tuesday, vowing to eradicate what he alleges are pro-North Korean forces within the country. 'I declare martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from the threat of North Korean communist forces, to eradicate the despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order,' Yoon said. Yoon cited the opposition Democratic Party’s recent actions, including its motion to impeach the country’s top prosecutors and rejection of a government budget proposal. The president denounced the opposition party for 'clear anti-state behavior aimed at inciting rebellion.' The Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, 'paralyzed state affairs and turned the National Assembly into a den of criminals,' Yoon said, adding that 'the National Assembly has become a monster undermining liberal democracy, and the nation is in a precarious state, teetering on the edge of collapse.' While Yoon did not specify what measures would be taken, the South Korean military said that 'activities by parliament and political parties would be banned, and that media and publishers would be under the control of the martial law command,' according to Reuters. The announcement marks the first time since 1980 that martial law was declared in South Korea. Lee Jae-myung, leader of the opposition party, slammed Yoon’s move, claiming that 'tanks, armored personnel carriers, and soldiers with guns and knives will rule the country' and that 'the economy of the Republic of Korea will collapse irretrievably.' Yoon acknowledged that the martial law might cause inconvenience but promised to 'eliminate the anti-state forces and restore the country to normalcy as quickly as possible.'

Israel warns Lebanon IDF attacks won’t be limited to Hezbollah if...	Lebanon must pay a price' - Israeli ministers say Lebanese military must prevent Hezbollah attacks or face Israeli retaliation. By World Israel News Staff Israeli leaders warned Beirut Tuesday that if the current ceasefire with Hezbollah fails due to Lebanon's failure to enforce the truce in its territory, Israel will hold the Lebanese government responsible. On Monday, Hezbollah terrorists shelled Mount Dov, inside Israeli territory, the most significant breach of the ceasefire since it went into effect last Wednesday. A day later, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) issued a statement, warning that should the truce continue to be violated and the ceasefire agreement collapse, Israel will not limit its retaliatory strikes to Hezbollah itself, but will instead hold the Lebanese government responsible. 'There will no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon,' Katz said while visiting Israel's northern border Tuesday. 'We will work with all our might to enforce all the understandings of the ceasefire agreement, and we show maximum response and zero tolerance.' 'Yesterday was the first test, the shooting at Mount Dov. We reacted strongly and this is exactly what we will do, and we will not allow Hezbollah to return to the old methods they had, such as the [Hezbollah] tent that was set up and not attacked.' Katz demanded that Beirut 'authorize the Lebanese army to enforce their part, to keep Hezbollah away beyond the Litani and to dismantle all the infrastructure.' 'If they don’t do it and this whole agreement collapses then the reality will be very clear. First of all, if we return to war we will act strongly, we will go deeper, and the most important thing they need to know, that there will be no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon.' Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) echoed Katz's statements during an interview Tuesday with Kan Reshet Bet. 'The IDF is enforcing the agreement and the Lebanese government needs to pay a price so that it has an incentive to enforce the agreement,' Smotrich said.

Israel rebuts ‘disappointing’ accusations by European powers on G...	Israeli military says hundreds of truckloads of international aid are waiting idly at Gaza crossing point, rebutting European accusations Israel is limiting entry of aid to Gaza. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel pushed back Tuesday after three European governments accused the Jewish state of blocking the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. On Monday, Britain, Germany, and France penned a letter to the Israeli government, demanding Jerusalem increase the amount of aid - in particular fuel - to the Gaza Strip ahead of the start of the winter season, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced via X. 'Together Britain, France, and Germany have written to the Israeli government to urge action on the unacceptable humanitarian situation in Gaza,' Lammy tweeted. 'Israel must implement the UN's winter plan now: send equipment to guard against cold & flooding, give access to fuel, repair vital infrastructure, and get aid in.' On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Ministry Spokesman Oren Marmorstein fired back, calling the European governments' accusations against Israel and failure to condemn ongoing terror attacks 'disappointing.' 'It is disappointing that the foreign ministers of the E3 (Britain, France and Germany) failed to address the October 7 massacre and the daily attacks on Israeli civilians since then in their letter,' Marmorstein said. 'Israel is facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and does not impose any restrictions on the quantity of aid entering the Strip.' Marmorstein said that despite Israel's willingness to permit the entry of the aid, international organizations have failed to do so, in part because of looting by Hamas-backed gangs. In a tweet directed at United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Marmorstein wrote Tuesday: 'Israel is facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and does not impose any restrictions on the quantity of aid entering the Strip.' 'The ones failing to distribute the aid are international organizations, due to Hamas looting and the politicization of humanitarian efforts led by Secretary-General Guterres.' Earlier this week, the UN relief agency UNRWA announced that it had halted aid transfers into Gaza through Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing - the primary entry point into the Gaza Strip. The agency's chief said the route through Gaza was not safe, noting that multiple aid convoys had been raided recently by armed gangs. The Israeli Defense Ministry on Tuesday also furnished data regarding the quantity of international aid accumulating at the Kerem Shalom crossing. According to the ministry's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), there are roughly 780 truckloads of international aid waiting at the Kerem Shalom crossing, waiting to be transferred by aid workers into Gaza. COGAT also said that 138 aid trucks entered Gaza from Israel's three Gaza crossings on Monday.

IDF kills seven Hamas terrorists who took part in October 7th atr...	Israeli forces eliminate seven Hamas terrorists who invaded Israel on October 7th and took part in the atrocities across southwestern Israel. By World Israel News Staff Israeli forces operating in the Gaza Strip have killed seven more terrorists affiliated with Hamas who were involved in the invasion of southwestern Israel on October 7th and the subsequent atrocities on the Israeli-side of the border, an Israeli military spokesperson said Tuesday afternoon. According to a statement released by the IDF spokesperson's office, reserve soldiers from the army's 99th Division, serving in their third deployment since October 7th, 2023, have been operating in the Gaza Strip for the past two weeks. During their most recent deployment to the Gaza Strip, the 99th Division killed seven Hamas terrorists who invaded Israel on October 7th. The eliminated terrorists include Marzouk al-Hur, Maaz al-Hur, Abd Abu-Awad Yusri, Omar Abu-Abdallah, and Maad Abu-Garboua. In addition, two members of the elite Nukhba Force unit, which spearheaded the invasions of October 7th, were killed, including Ahmed Zahid and Abd al-Razzeq, a Hamas combat engineer. The IDF's 179th and 551st Brigades carried out multiple raids in the Gaza Strip recently, the army spokesperson said, in operations targeting Hamas facilities, observation posts, and sniper positions. During their raids, the 179th and 551st Brigades also confiscated or dismantled weapons at a number of caches. The caches included stores of bullet-proof vests, grenades, guns, ammunition, explosives, and mortars. In a separate statement on Tuesday, the IDF said it had carried out a drone strike on a vehicle transporting several terrorists in northern Samaria, outside the Palestinian Authority-administered town of Aqabah, on the western edge of the Jordan Valley. The Palestinian Authority's health ministry reported that two people were killed in the drone strike, with a third person injured and listed in moderate condition.

Minister accuses Israeli A-G of coup d’etat after prison service ...	Itamar Ben-Gvir, who appointed Kobi Yaakobi, accused the attorney-general of attempting a 'coup' against him with the move. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The head of Israel’s Prison Service (IPS) was detained for questioning Monday along with two senior police officers, in a case that National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called part of an attempted 'coup' against him. While there is an official gag order on the case, according to Ma'ariv, Chief Superintendent Kobi Yaakobi was mainly questioned about having allegedly passed on information from a senior police officer to Ben-Gvir regarding administrative arrests of right-wing activists. The deputy superintendent who allegedly leaked the classified information supposedly did so in return for a promotion that Yaakobi allegedly advocated for him. The officer’s arrest on suspicion of bribery was extended until Thursday, Ynet reported. A second police officer has also been detained on several charges, including failure to fulfill his duty, and misuse of authority. Other Hebrew media reported that during the 12-hour interrogation, Yaakobi was questioned about an incident in which he allegedly asked a policewoman to have a third party delete messages on Telegram that were considered damaging to National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Ynet reported that the third party was given the impression that his career advancement was on the line if he rejected the request. Yaakobi himself is suspected of obstruction of an investigative process and committing 'breach of trust,' an amorphous charge that is considered difficult to prove. He was released after the interrogation on condition that he does not contact any other suspects in the case and does not speak publicly about it. In a statement to Channel 12 Monday, he therefore said that he could not speak freely but that he has 'nothing to hide and nothing to hide from.' Yaakobi is close to Ben-Gvir, who appointed him to his position after he had served as Ben-Gvir’s security adviser. The National Security Minister blasted the arrests and interrogations as a way for Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara to get to him, as his ministry is in charge of both the police and prison service. 'The attorney general and the State Prosecutor’s Office are using the Department of Internal Police Investigations to deter a very senior officer in the Prison Service and police officers from carrying out my policy and that of the right-wing government,' Ben Gvir wrote on X Monday before Yaakobi’s name was allowed to be published. He went so far as to call her move an attempted 'coup,' saying, 'The decision to investigate officers who are operating according to my policies is a political decision that aims to overthrow the right-wing government.' Ben-Gvir gave Yaakobi his 'full support,' saying, 'As Commissioner, he has revolutionized the IPS, achieving governance and order within the organization.' Baharav-Miara, he added, 'did not like the changes and policies [Yaakobi] implemented, but in a democratic country, there is no room for 'framing a case’ against someone whose views and policies are not the same as yours.' The attorney-general has fiercely criticized Ben-Gvir several times for acting improperly and even illegally since he came into office, especially in the area of intervening in police operations, which she said the minister is barred from doing.

Hamas leadership welcomed by multiple countries, including Malays...	According to Sky News Arabia, senior Hamas officials left Doha for 'various destinations.' JNS Various countries—including Turkey, Iran and Russia—have welcomed Hamas members in recent weeks after the terror group’s leadership was asked to leave Qatar, Israel’s Kan News reported on Monday night. Senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya, once the deputy of now-slain terrorist mastermind Yahya Sinwar, has settled in Ankara, while others were said to be considering a move to Malaysia. Malaysia, a country with a Muslim majority and sizable Buddhist and Christian minorities, does not have diplomatic relations with Israel. Earlier on Monday, Sky News Arabia reported that Hamas’s entire senior leadership had left Qatar. Arab sources told the British channel that the terrorists’ family members had also left the country. According to the report, the senior Hamas officials left Doha for 'various destinations.' Hamas’s military wing is known to run the group’s operations in Malaysia. In 2010, Hamas sent 15 men to the Asian country to train in paragliding. Hamas used paragliders to infiltrate the Jewish state during their Oct. 7, 2023, invasion. In 2018, Hamas engineer Fadi Muhammad al-Batash was shot dead in Kuala Lumpur. He was an expert in suicide drones and rocket systems. The terror group accused Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency of orchestrating his death. Two years ago, Malaysian police arrested a group of locals on suspicions of kidnapping a Gaza-born computer programmer on Israel’s orders, allegedly because the Mossad believed him to be a Hamas asset. Unnamed Israeli sources previously confirmed to Kan that Hamas had relocated to Turkey. According to the Nov. 17 report, the development could have 'dramatic' consequences for the truce talks between Israel and Hamas, which have been mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. Hamas repudiated the reports, claiming that they were rumors spread by Israel. A Turkish diplomatic source also denied the claim, clarifying that members of the terrorist organization occasionally visit the country. A senior Hamas official told AFP on Monday that the Islamist group is waiting until international pressure forces Israel to end its war in Gaza before it will return to the negotiating table and close a hostage deal. 'Egypt, Qatar and Turkey are making great efforts to reach an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange,' said a Hamas official who was part of a Sunday meeting in Cairo on the issue, referring to a possible exchange of captives for Palestinian terrorists jailed in the Jewish state. 'Our Palestinian people are waiting for American and international pressure on [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu to stop the war and reach an agreement, as happened in Lebanon,' the terrorist added. Jerusalem believes that 97 of the 251 hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023 terror assault remain in Gaza. Hamas is also holding two Israeli civilians who entered Gaza in 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed during 'Operation Protective Edge' in 2014.

‘Refreshing’ – Israeli minister hails Trump’s ultimatum to Hamas	Senior Israeli minister lauds American president-elect's recent comments on Israeli captives in the Gaza Strip and warning to Hamas that there 'will be hell to pay' if hostages are not released by inauguration day. By World Israel News Staff A senior Israeli government minister lauded former President and President-elect Donald Trump Tuesday, hailing Trump's ultimatum to the Hamas terror organization Monday. On Monday, the incoming president took to the Truth Social media platform, demanding that Hamas release the captives held in the Gaza Strip by inauguration day on January 20th, warning that there 'will be hell to pay' if the demand is not met. 'Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America,' Trump wrote. On Tuesday, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) responded to Trump's comments, taking to X to tweet his appreciation for the president-elect's 'morally sound statements.' 'Thank you very much, Mr. President-elect! How refreshing it is to hear clear and morally sound statements that do not create a false equivalence or call for addressing 'both sides,' but rather clarify who are the good and who are the bad, where the light is and where the darkness lies,' Smotrich wrote in both Hebrew and English. 'This is the way to bring back the hostages: by increasing the pressure and the costs for Hamas and its supporters, and defeating them, rather than, giving in to their absurd demands. Thank You Donald Trump.' Israeli President Isaac Herzog also thanked Trump for his comments, tweeting: 'Thank you and bless you Mr. President-elect @realDonaldTrump. We all pray for the moment we see our sisters and brothers back home!' Since the November election, President-elect Trump has reportedly called for ceasefires both in Lebanon and Gaza, ending the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in the north and Hamas in the south. During the 2024 election campaign, Trump repeatedly urged Israel to wrap up its war in Gaza, a message he reiterated in a call to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following the presidential election.

State Department: US hasn’t determined if Israel violated Lebanon...	Matthew Miller, State Dept. spokesman, said that the ceasefire agreement, signed by Israel and Lebanon, contains a mechanism for reporting potential violations and how Washington and Paris will respond to them. By Mike Wagenheim, JNS The U.S. State Department said on Monday that the Israeli-Hezbollah ceasefire, which went into effect last Wednesday, is thus far 'successful, broadly speaking,' with no determination yet made of accusations of Israeli violations. Despite ongoing Israeli anti-terror strikes and Monday’s retaliation by Hezbollah, the ceasefire, brokered by the United States and France, has 'been successful in stopping the fighting and getting us on a path where we are not seeing the daily loss of life that we had seen for two months prior,' Matthew Miller, the department’s spokesman, told reporters at the daily press briefing. Miller said that violations were expected, especially in the opening weeks 'when things are very fragile.' Media reports cited Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration’s point man on the Israel-Lebanon file, as having been critical of early Israeli actions in Lebanon since the ceasefire came into effect. Miller did not confirm those reports. The ceasefire agreement, signed by Israel and Lebanon and which has not been made public, contains a mechanism for reporting potential violations and for the ways that Washington and Paris will respond to them, he said. That mechanism will become more formalized in the coming days, he noted. The National, an Emirati publication, printed what it says is the entirety of the ceasefire agreement last week. JNS asked Miller if that copy of the agreement, which was reported in Israel and elsewhere, was accurate. 'I’m not going to speak to that publicly,' Miller told JNS. 'We often see outlets report on various documents—sometimes that are final drafts, sometimes that are drafts along the way—but I’m not going to confirm.' JNS asked if it isn’t in the public interest for Washington to release the agreement. 'We have a vigorous monitoring mechanism in place to ensure that everyone toes the line, and we’re going to enforce it,' Miller said. He would not confirm reports that, under the agreement, Israel has the right to conduct strikes in Lebanese territory should it detect an imminent threat. 'But every country, both Israel—or say every country—that includes Israel and includes Lebanon as well—has the inherent right to self-defense under international law,' said Miller. 'That was a fact before the implementation of this ceasefire agreement. It remains a fact that all countries have the right to self-defense under international law.' ‘Incredibly frustrating’ Earlier in the day, the State Department and U.S. Treasury welcomed the Israeli cabinet’s decision to approve a 'one-year extension of its indemnification for Israeli banks, which underpins correspondent banking relationships with Palestinian counterparts.' That agreement protects Israeli banks doing business with Palestinian counterparts from running afoul of anti-terror laws. Israel reportedly secured a promise from the Biden administration to maintain its veto on Palestinian statehood at the U.N. Security Council in exchange for the banking decision. JNS asked Miller about the talks that led up to the announcement. 'We had really intense discussions with the government of Israel about intending—extending this correspondent banking agreement—much more intense conversations than should have been necessary,' Miller said. 'Obviously, the revocation of this agreement would have had disastrous effects for Palestinians in the West Bank, but the point that we kept impressing upon the government of Israel is that it would have had disastrous implications for the Israeli public as well,' he said. (The Biden administration and some others refer to Judea and Samaria as the West Bank.) 'It is not in Israel’s interests to see further instability in the West Bank. It is not in Israel’s interest to see the economy of the West Bank collapse,' Miller added. 'So, it’s incredibly frustrating that it took this long to get the government of Israel to extend this agreement for the year that it now did, something they should have just done through the regular course of business without any—let’s call it intense diplomatic efforts by the United States.' That said, Washington 'will continue to look at every resolution that comes before the United Nations Security Council, and judge whether voting ‘yes,’ voting ‘no,’ voting abstaining is in the interests of the United States, and we will make our judgments based on that and nothing else,' he added. Miller also told JNS that Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, was scheduled to meet later in the day with Ron Dermer, the Israeli strategic affairs minister and that there were no planned meetings at the State Department with Yoav Gallant, the former Israeli defense minister, who is in town.

Actor Kevin Spacey visits Gaza border communities in Israel devas...	Spacey was also photographed talking to Ayala Levinstein, a lone soldier from the U.S. whose father is reportedly a close friend of his. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner American actor Kevin Spacey visited over the weekend areas near the Israel-Gaza border that were impacted by the Oct. 7 deadly Hamas terrorist attack last year, Israel’s ILTV News reported. The former 'House of Cards' star, along with pro-Israel British author and journalist Douglas Murray, toured the site of the Nova music festival massacre and communities such as Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where 62 people were murdered last Oct. 7 and 19 others were taken hostage by Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists. Two hostages who were kidnapped from Kfar Aza on Oct. 7 — Yotam Haim and Alon Shamriz — escaped their kidnappers in the Gaza Strip but were mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers in December 2023. Spacey was also photographed in Israel talking to Ayala Levinstein, a lone soldier from the US who is serving in the IDF’s combat intelligence unit. The two-time Academy Award winner is reportedly a close friend of Levinstein’s father. Spacey is scheduled to leave Israel on Monday night. Murray is in Israel for scheduled speaking events, including two at the Tel Aviv Culture Center on Wednesday. The New York Times best-selling author said in a post on X that 3,000 people attended an event he participated in with conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro in Jerusalem in mid-November.

IAF hits Hezbollah after terror group fires mortars at Mount Dov	The Iranian-backed terrorist organization took responsibility for the Mount Dov attack, claiming it had fired at an Israeli military outpost 'as a warning.' By Joshua Marks, JNS The Israeli Air Force struck Hezbollah terrorist assets across Lebanon on Monday night in response to the Iranian proxy’s firing of two mortar shells across the border hours earlier in violation of the Nov. 27 ceasefire. Among the targets of the strikes was the launcher used in the Har Dov attacks, in the area of Berghoz in Southern Lebanon. Dozens of other launchers were also hit, along with Hezbollah terrorists and infrastructure, according to the Israel Defense Forces. 'Hezbollah’s launches tonight constitute a violation of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon. The State of Israel demands that the relevant parties in Lebanon fulfill their responsibilities and prevent Hezbollah’s hostile activity from within Lebanese territory. The State of Israel remains obligated to the fulfillment of the conditions of the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon,' the IDF said. The IAF struck Hezbollah terrorists, dozens of launchers, and terrorist infrastructure throughout Lebanon a short while ago. Additionally, the IAF struck the Hezbollah launcher in the area of Berghoz in southern Lebanon shortly after the launch of the two projectiles toward Mount… &mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) December 2, 2024 'The IDF is prepared to continue operating wherever necessary and will continue to operate to defend Israeli civilians,' the statement concluded. The Iranian-backed terrorist organization took responsibility for the Mount Dov attack, claiming it had fired at an Israeli military outpost 'as a warning.' The mortar shells impacted in open territory, causing no injuries or damage. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated following the attack that, 'We promised to respond to any violation of the ceasefire by Hezbollah—and that is exactly what we will do. Hezbollah’s firing at the IDF post on Mount Dov will be met with a harsh response.' 'What was will no longer be,' he added. Also on Monday night, a drone 'launched from the east' was intercepted by an Israeli Navy missile ship in the Red Sea area before crossing into Israeli territory, the military said, publishing a video of the interception. ספינת טילים של חיל הים יירטה לפני זמן קצר במרחב ים סוף כלי טיס בלתי מאויש ששוגר ממזרח. הכלי יורט בטרם חצה לשטח הארץ, על פי מדיניות לא הופעלו התרעות pic.twitter.com/ul0pBtL8F5 &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) December 2, 2024 Earlier on Monday, the IDF said that it had operated in the morning and on Sunday in response to threats posed by Hezbollah in violation of the truce, which went into effect on the morning of Nov. 27. The listed violations included several military vehicles operating in the area of a Hezbollah missile manufacturing site in the Beqaa Valley, that were struck, as were several sites next to the Syria-Lebanon border in the Hermel area that the IDF said were used to smuggle weapons. 'These posed a threat to the State of Israel and were a violation of the ceasefire understandings,' the IDF statement noted, adding that 'the IDF is operating against any threat against the State of Israel.' IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Sky News Arabia on Monday that Jerusalem remains committed to the ceasefire terms. 'UNIFIL forces and the Lebanese government must fulfill their roles—this is also in their interest. We need this period to ensure there are no terror bases there,' he said, emphasizing that the Lebanese people and government must ensure that 'Beirut and Southern Lebanon are free of weapons—not in homes, not in yards and not in children’s rooms.' Under the terms of the truce, Israeli forces are to withdraw from Lebanon over a period of 60 days, while Lebanon’s official army enters those areas vacated by the IDF. Hezbollah violated the terms of the ceasefire the day it took effect, according to the Israeli military. The governments of France and the United States, which are members of the monitoring mechanism overseeing the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire agreement, have also claimed violations by Jerusalem, primarily the use of IDF surveillance drones over Beirut. According to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, he told his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barrot on Monday that 'Israel is not violating the ceasefire understandings but is instead enforcing them in response to Hezbollah’s violations.' In a statement, the diplomat reiterated Jerusalem’s commitment to implementing the agreement and made it clear that Israel 'will not return to the reality of October 6, 2023,' the day before the Hamas-led massacre in the northwestern Negev that triggered the war.

Hamas, Palestinian Authority ink deal to jointly rule post-war Ga...	The Palestinian Authority's ruling Fatah party reportedly has agreed to share control of the Gaza Strip with Hamas after the current war with Israel. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Hamas terror organization has signed an agreement with the ruling faction of the Palestinian Authority paving the way for joint control of the Gaza Strip once the current war with Israel ends, according to a report Tuesday morning. Negotiators from Hamas and the Fatah party both told AFP Tuesday morning that the two sides had agreed to jointly administer the post-war Gaza Strip, adding that the rival factions have inked an agreement delineating the format for governing the coastal enclave. According to a draft of the agreement seen by AFP, once the current war with Israel is concluded, Hamas will form a joint committee with Fatah, made up of 10 to 15 non-partisan members chosen by the two organizations, to administer the Gaza Strip. The committee will, according to the agreement, be tasked with managing Gazan affairs ranging from education, healthcare, the distribution of international aid, reconstruction, and the economy. Under the terms of the agreement, Fatah and Hamas would jointly administer the Rafah crossing on the Gaza-Egyptian border. The deal was negotiated by delegations from the two factions, headed by Hamas politburo member Khalil al-Hayya and Fatah central committee member Azzam al-Ahmad. The agreement must still be brought to Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas for final approval, the report said. The document does not address Israel's role in the post-war Gaza Strip, ignoring the Netanyahu government's repeated declarations that the IDF will maintain a long-term security presence in Gaza. While a number of his ministers have called for comprehensive Israeli control and even resettlement of the Strip, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Israel will, at the very least, maintain control over the Philadelphi Corridor - which includes the Rafah crossing - as well as the Netzarim Corridor running across the neck of central Gaza.

No chance for goodbyes – American hostage’s mother dies	Gladys Siegel, 97, never knew her son was abducted on Oct. 7 or that he was held captive in Gaza ever since. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Gladys Siegel, the mother of American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, died Monday night at age 97 without her youngest child getting the chance to part from her. 'My father’s mother died and my father can’t say goodbye to her because he is in Hamas captivity for more than a year,' Siegel’s daughter Elan wrote in a Facebook post. 'My father can’t stand with us tomorrow in the cemetery, he can’t say goodbye to the woman who loved him and raised him his whole life,' she added. 'A violent and murderous terror organization dictates our lives — from Gaza to the great United States and the whole world is silent.' Living in an assisted-living facility in North Carolina, Gladys was never informed that her son, Keith, 65, had been abducted by Hamas terrorists last October 7 and has been held in Gaza ever since. Siegel and his wife, Aviva, members of Kibbutz Kfar Aza, were forced into their own car to be driven into the Gaza Strip by the terrorists who invaded their pastoral community as part of a coordinated surprise attack by thousands on dozens of locations in Israel, in which they massacred 1,200 and took 251 people in all as hostages. The terrorists also forced a neighbor and her two children into the Siegel car as well. Aviva was released among 86 kidnapped Israeli women and children during the week-long hostage-for-Palestinian prisoners exchange and ceasefire in November 2023, in the only deal to date with the terrorist organization. Out of the 101 people Hamas and other terrorists are still holding, Keith, 65, is still believed to be among those alive. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer reportedly told President-elect Donald Trump last month that the Israeli government thinks that 60 are still living, although officially the number stands at 76. Besides Siegel, there are seven other hostages with American citizenship. Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, of Kibbutz Nir Oz, is the only other American civilian still thought to be alive. Hamas released on Saturday a video of lone soldier Edan Alexander, 20, looking gaunt and pleading in both Hebrew and English for Israeli and U.S. leaders, including president-elect Donald Trump, to get a deal done to free him and his fellow abductees. Judi (70) and Gadi Haggai (73) of Kibbutz Nir Oz, and another soldier on duty that day, Itay Chen (19), were murdered on October 7 and their bodies taken by the terrorists. Hersh Goldberg-Polin (23) was kidnapped from the Nova festival and murdered in August along with five other hostages as IDF soldiers neared the tunnel where they were being held captive. On Monday, the IDF confirmed that American-Israeli lone soldier Omer Neutra had been murdered on the day of the invasion after he and his tank crew battled the terrorists, with his body still being held in Gaza. That evening, Trump posted a demand on his social platform that all the hostages be released by the day of his inauguration, January 20, 2025. If they aren’t freed by then, he promised, 'there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America.'

Chinese relic uncovered – in Jerusalem	The earliest known Chinese inscription in Israel, dating back 500 years, uncovered in Jerusalem. By World Israel News Staff The earliest archaeological evidence of the relationship between the Land of Israel and China was uncovered in Jerusalem on Mount Zion in an archaeological dig jointly conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Protestant Institute of Archaeology. A rare 16th century CE Chinese inscription was discovered on a porcelain bowl fragment, reading: 'Forever we will guard the eternal spring.' For the past three years, a joint excavation project between the Israel Antiquities Authority and the German Protestant Institute of Archeology (GPIA) has been underway at Mount Zion. Most of the findings uncovered in the excavation, led by Prof. Dieter Vieweger, date from the Byzantine period and earlier to the Second Temple period – well over 1,500 years ago. Against this background, the excavators were amazed to discover this inscription on the site, which belongs to a later period and has an unexpected origin. This past summer, during routine procedures for the upcoming excavation season, Michael Chernin, an archaeologist at the Israel Antiquities Authority, suddenly spotted a colorful object sticking out of the dirt that had been cleared away while preparing the site. When Michael pulled out the object and washed it, he recognized that there was an inscription on its bottom. Dr. Anna de Vincenz, pottery specialist, identified the inscription to be Chinese. At this point— the vessel was examined by the Hebrew University in Jerusalem’s researcher Jingchao Chen, who deciphered the inscription as reading, 'We will forever guard the eternal spring.' The bowl dates back to 1520-1570, and originated in the Ming Dynasty. 'Ancient Chinese porcelain vessels were previously found in Israel, but this is the first to bear an inscription,' say the researchers. How did a dish make its way from China to Mount Zion? Historical writings indicate close 16th century trade relations between the Chinese Empire and the Ottoman Empire, then ruling the Land of Israel. According to Ming Dynasty annals, about 20 official Ottoman delegations visited the imperial court in Beijing during the 15th-17th centuries. The trade relations between these empires are also described in travel books of merchants from this period. Thus, the writings of the Chinese scholar Ma Li from 1541 note colonies of Chinese merchants in Lebanese coastal cities such as Beirut and Tripoli. The work even mentions other important cities in the region such as Jerusalem, Cairo and Aleppo. 'In archaeological research, evidence of trade relations between merchants in the Land of Israel and the Far East is known even from earlier periods – for example, of various spices,' said Israel Antiquities Authority Director Eli Escusido. 'But it is fascinating to meet evidence of these relations also in the form of an actual inscription, written in the Chinese language, and in an unexpected place – on Mount Zion in Jerusalem.'

U.S. frets that Israel-Lebanon ceasefire ‘unraveling’	Biden administration officials complain that Israel is 'enforcing the ceasefire too aggressively.' By World Israel News Staff The U.S. is concerned that the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon could 'unravel' in the near future, with Hezbollah firing at IDF positions on Mount Dov and Jerusalem launching retaliatory attacks. Defense Minister Israel Katz pledged that any violations of the ceasefire by Hezbollah terrorists would invoke strong action from the Israeli army - a vow which has worried Washington. The Biden administration appeared to place the onus of responsibility on Israel, with a U.S. official telling Axios that 'the Israelis have been playing a dangerous game in recent days.' Biden Middle East adviser Amos Hochstein, who tried unsuccessfully for months to broker the ceasefire, reportedly complained to an Israeli official that Israel was 'enforcing the ceasefire too aggressively.' On Monday evening, the IDF carried out strikes targeting 'Hezbollah terrorists, dozens of launchers, and terrorist infrastructure throughout Lebanon,' hours after the terror group fired two shells at IDF assets in northern Israel. Despite the flare-up, Israeli officials assured Hochstein that they are committed to the ceasefire, according to the Axios report. 'We have warned both sides – Israel and Hezbollah – against actions that jeopardize the implementation of the ceasefire agreement,' U.S. officials told the Jerusalem Post. The sources added that they had chastised Israel to 'calm down,' and presumably ignore Hezbollah's violations of the ceasefire, rather than forcefully respond. The full terms of the Lebanon ceasefire agreement have not been made public. While residents of the north have been encouraged to return to their homes, schools in the northern border region have not reopened. Many of the tens of thousands displaced from their homes for more than 14 months have stressed that they will not return home until there is a decisive victory over Hezbollah, rather than a diplomatic agreement.

1,000 Nova survivors recognized as ‘disabled’ terror victims	Survivors of the massacre witnessed Hamas terrorists murdering, raping, kidnapping, and mutilating their victims. By World Israel News Staff More than 2,000 attendees of the Nova Festival requested psychological assistance from Israel's social services, and at least 1,000 survivors are recognized by the state as being disabled due to severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), according to a new report. More than a year after the Nova Festival Massacre, the Knesset's Information Center published a report regarding the psychological and financial support the state and social services have provided to survivors of the event. 399 people were murdered at the Nova party, marking the largest single-incident slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. According to the report, at least one Nova Festival survivor has taken their own life, with three others attempting suicide. The National Insurance Institute has recognized 3,710 attendees as victims of terror, a status which provides them with rights including psychological help and financial aid, including compensation for those who cannot work due to their physical injuries or mental state. At least 1,000 survivors are classified by the National Insurance Institute as suffering from disability, due to their level of trauma and mental distress interfering with their everyday functioning. Survivors of the massacre witnessed Hamas terrorists murdering, raping, kidnapping, and mutilating their victims. Slightly more than 2,000 attendees asked the state for mental support, including meeting with a psychologist. 75 percent of Nova Festival survivors are between the ages of 18 to 24, 20 percent are aged 25 to 45, and an additional 5 percent are younger than 18 or older than 45. Notably, the report features incomplete data, as it only includes information about people who attended the party who were not members of the IDF. It's unknown exactly how many off-duty IDF soldiers attended the Nova Festival, but based on Israel's mandatory draft and the ages of most attendees, the number likely includes hundreds of people. Those who were IDF soldiers at the time of the massacre are treated by the army's psychological welfare system, and therefore are not included in the report's data. This also means that suicides and suicide attempts by soldiers who survived the Nova Festival massacre are not reflected in the report.

Ex-hostage: ‘Gazans are brainwashed since birth to hate Jews’	Gazans are 'happy to sacrifice their children to kill Jews. That’s how they live,' says freed hostage Louis Har. By World Israel News Staff A former hostage held by the Hamas terror group said that his political views had changed dramatically following his abduction, noting that the average Gazan is raised from a young age to support the murder of Jews. Louis Har, 71, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak on October 7th. His sister, niece, long-term girlfriend, and brother-in-law were also abducted. Har's sister, niece, and girlfriend were released in a December 2023 hostage deal, while he and his brother-in-law were held in various locations throughout Gaza. 'My views have changed a lot from October 6 until today,' Har said during a recent interview on the Melting Pot podcast. 'I don’t trust any of [the Gazans]. I know that in some way, everyone in Gaza is involved. They were born to hate. They are given weapons when they are babies. They’re happy to sacrifice their children to kill Jews. That’s how they live.' Har said that the brainwashing is so intense that even having a dialogue with the average Gazan regarding peace with Israel cannot happen, until there are dramatic changes to the Gazan education system 'To achieve dialogue and coexistence, several generations of proper education in which hatred isn’t taught need to pass. That does not exist. There is no one to talk to. Before I was abducted, I wanted to live [alongside them] in peace and coexistence,' he added. In Israel, Har stressed, 'we do not hate. We are truly trying to move forward.' In February 2024, Har and his brother-in-law were rescued from an apartment building in Rafah - where they were held in a Gazan family's home - in a daring IDF operation. When NPR asked Har about Gazans killed during the rescue raid, the former captive said that 'most of the people there are Hamas. They don't intend to pet us and to love us, and I have no mercy toward them at the moment.'

President Herzog: 'The IDF is a morally responsible army that adheres to the highest international legal standards and humanitarian principles, with each unit supported by thorough legal guidance.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News At a screening of a film about October 7th at the Museum of Tolerance in Jerusalem, Israeli President Isaac Herzog implicitly criticized remarks made by former Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon that the IDF was committing 'war crimes' and 'ethnic cleansing' in Gaza, Arutz Sheva reports. Before the screening of The Children of October 7th,' President Herzog described the 'diplomatic and security challenges' Israel faces, as well as attempt to harm Israel's standing among nations through biased and unilateral legal forums, such as the International Criminal Court and its arrest warrants issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. He stated, 'Repeatedly, we counter false accusations against us, including the baseless claims of genocide or ethnic cleansing supposedly committed by the IDF. These are complete lies. IDF soldiers do not murder, nor do they engage in ethnic cleansing. End of story.' The President stated, 'The IDF is a morally responsible army that adheres to the highest international legal standards and humanitarian principles, with each unit supported by thorough legal guidance.' Herzog emphasized the right of Israel to defend itself, particularly when faced with the devastation of October 7th in kibbutzim such as Moshav Netiv HaAsara, which lost 21 residents. Responding indirectly to Moshe Ya'alon's remarks, Herzog said, 'The accusation that IDF soldiers engage in genocide or ethnic cleansing is not only completely false and disconnected from reality, but it also undermines our soldiers, commanders, and Israel's security and diplomatic efforts during wartime. I fully condemn and reject these claims.' Ya'alon, who was once the IDF's Chief of Staff and served as Defense Minister nearly a decade ago in a previous government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said in an interview with Democract Tv that the IDF is guilty of ethnic cleansing in Gaza. Speaking to Channel 12, Ya'alon reiterated his remarks, claiming that 'far-right' elements within Netanyahu's coalition were instructing the IDF to 'carry out what are defined as war crimes.' Ya'alon added that the IDF is 'no longer the most moral army in the world.'

Four face terror charges over flares launched at PM’s residence	The prosecution requested that the defendants be held in detention until the end of the legal proceedings. By JNS Prosecutors filed terrorism charges on Monday against four suspects over the launching of maritime flares at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea on the night of Nov. 16. Rear Adm. (res.) Ofer Doron, 63, his son Gal Doron, 27, Amir Sadeh, 62, and Itay Yafeh, 62, were charged in the Haifa District Court with terrorism-related reckless behavior, attempted arson, and obstruction of justice. The decision to launch the flares during a demonstration outside Netanyahu’s residence was driven by ideological and political motives, according to a Channel 12 summary of the indictment. The anti-government activists allegedly wanted to send a message to Netanyahu that the demonstrations near his Caesarea home were still ongoing, with the goal of increasing the pressure on him to advance the demands of the protesters. The indictment also underscores that the defendants anticipated their actions would likely incite fear and panic, especially among those near the prime minister’s home, including Netanyahu and his family. Furthermore, the indictment accuses Ofer of trying to protect his son Gal by misleading investigators about his involvement. The indictment also describes how Gal Doron and Yafeh put on gloves for the launch, which Ofer Doron recorded with the intention of uploading to social media. The prosecution emphasized that the defendants were aware that the firing of the flares could spark a fire in a populated area. During a hearing at the Rishon Letzion Magistrate’s Court, Ofer Doron did not apologize to Netanyahu or his family, but to his security detail affected by the incident, saying that the act was intended as a nonviolent public protest. 'We never intended to harm a symbol of governance. That’s not the nature of our protest. We’ve always said violence is unacceptable,' he said. The prosecution requested that the defendants be held in detention until the end of the legal proceedings. Netanyahu and his family were not home at the time of the attack. Video of the incident posted to social media shows two flares launched into the sky. They fell in the yard of the home.

One cleat displayed the message 'Surely to Allah we belong and to him we will all return,' while the other listed Hamas casualty figures from the war. By Jewish Breaking News Houston Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair made headlines Sunday not only for knocking out Jacksonville Jaguars star quarterback Trevor Lawrence with a controversial hit, but also for wearing cleats displaying inflated Gazan casualty numbers. The second-quarter collision, which sparked a bench-clearing brawl at TIAA Bank Field, saw Al-Shaair deliver a violent blow to Lawrence’s head as the quarterback attempted to slide. The hit resulted in Lawrence’s immediate removal from the game with a concussion and Al-Shaair’s ejection alongside Jaguars cornerback Jarrian Jones. But it was Al-Shaair’s choice of footwear that drew equal ire from fans on social media. As part of the NFL’s annual My Cause My Cleats initiative, the linebacker opted to support the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund. One cleat displayed the message 'Surely to Allah we belong and to him we will all return,' while the other listed Hamas casualty figures from the war. Al-Shaair talked about his decision to wear the cleats last month. 'I feel like it’s something that’s trying to be almost silenced,' he told the Houston Chronicle. 'On either side, people losing their life is not right. In no way, shape or form am I validating anything that happened, but to consistently say that because of Oct. 7 innocent people in Gaza should now die, it’s crazy.' The number of civilian casualties in Gaza has been at the center of international attention since the start of the war. The main source for the data has been the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry (MOH), which now claims more than 45,000 dead, the majority of which it says are children and women. However, a closer examination reveals that Hamas has been using unreliable methods to count the dead. According to a Washington Institute report, Hamas’ data collection methods changed dramatically in early November 2023 after hospitals in northern Gaza began shutting down during Israel’s ground invasion. The MOH switched from traditional hospital and morgue certification to an undefined system based on media reports—a dramatic shift that went largely unacknowledged. MOH statistics also fail to distinguish between civilian and terrorist casualties, further complicating efforts to assess the true human cost of the conflict. That an NFL player can prominently display propaganda statistics without any scrutiny from the league or major media outlets speaks volumes about the current state of American institutions' commitment to truth.

US, UAE discussed lifting Assad sanctions in exchange for break w...	If Assad embraces Iranian help for a counter-offensive, that could also complicate efforts to drive a wedge between them. By Reuters and The Algemeiner The US and the United Arab Emirates have discussed with each other the possibility of lifting sanctions on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad if he peels himself away from Iran and cuts off weapons routes to Lebanon’s Hezbollah, five people familiar with the matter said. The conversations intensified in recent months, the sources said, driven by the possible expiry on Dec. 20 of sweeping US sanctions on Syria and by Israel’s campaign against Tehran’s regional network, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and Iranian assets in Syria. The discussions took place before anti-Assad rebels swept into Aleppo last week in their biggest offensive in Syria for years. According to the sources, the new rebel advance is a signal of precisely the sort of weakness in Assad‘s alliance with Iran that the Emirati and US initiative aims to exploit. But if Assad embraces Iranian help for a counter-offensive, that could also complicate efforts to drive a wedge between them, the sources said. Iran‘s foreign minister Abbas Araqchi visited Syria on Sunday in a show of support for Assad, and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke to Assad by phone about latest developments at the weekend. For this story, Reuters spoke to two US sources, four Syrian and Lebanese interlocutors, and two foreign diplomats who said the US and UAE see a window to drive a wedge between Assad and Iran, which helped him recapture swathes of his country during the civil war that erupted in 2011. Lebanese media have reported that Israel had suggested lifting US sanctions on Syria. But the UAE initiative with the US has not previously been reported. All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the back-room diplomacy. Syria’s government and the White House did not respond to questions from Reuters. The UAE referred Reuters to its statement on bin Zayed’s call with Assad. The UAE has taken a leading role in rehabilitating Assad among the mainly Sunni Muslim Arab states that shunned him after he accepted help from Shi’ite, non-Arab Iran to put down the Sunni-led rebellion against him. The Emirates hosted Assad in 2022, his first visit to an Arab country since the start of the war, before the Arab League reinstated Syria’s membership. The UAE has long hoped to distance Assad from Iran and wants to build business ties with Syria, but US sanctions have hampered those efforts, the sources said. A senior regional diplomat briefed by Tehran told Reuters Iran had been informed 'about behind-the-scenes efforts by some Arab countries to isolate Iran … by distancing Syria from Tehran.' The diplomat said those efforts were linked to offers of possible sanctions relief by Washington. ‘CARROT AND STICK’ Hezbollah, an internationally designated terrorist group, and its patron Iran have intervened in Syria since 2012 to protect Assad against Sunni rebels — but their bases and weapons shipments through Syria have been repeatedly hit by Israel, which has sought to weaken Iran across the region. In recent months, Hezbollah withdrew fighters from Syria, including the north, to focus on battling Israel in southern Lebanon. The rebels who swept this week into Aleppo pointed to the Hezbollah withdrawal as one of the reasons why they faced little resistance from government forces. A US source familiar with the matter said White House officials discussed an overture with Emirati officials, citing the UAE‘s interest in financing Syria’s reconstruction and Assad‘s 'weakened position' after Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah. The possibility of sanctions relief for Assad, while Israel was hitting Iran‘s allies, created an 'opportunity' to apply a 'carrot-and-stick approach' to fracture Syria’s alliance with Iran and Hezbollah, the US source said. SANCTIONS RELIEF The US placed sanctions on Syria after Assad cracked down against protests against him in 2011, and the sanctions were repeatedly tightened in the years of war that followed. The toughest, known as the Caesar Act, passed Congress in 2019. The Caesar sanctions apply across Syrian business sectors, to anyone dealing with Syria regardless of nationality and to those dealing with Russian and Iranian entities in Syria. Assad said they amounted to economic warfare, blaming them for the Syrian currency’s collapse and drop in living standards. The sanctions will 'sunset' — or expire — on Dec. 20 unless renewed by US lawmakers. Part of the recent American-Emirati discussions centered on allowing Caesar sanctions to expire without renewal, said the US source and three of the Syrian interlocutors. One Syrian interlocutor said the UAE had raised letting them expire with White House officials two months ago, after having unsuccessfully pushed for at least two years of sanctions relief for Assad after a deadly earthquake in Feb. 2023. Mohammad Alaa Ghanem, a Syrian activist in Washington, DC with the Citizens for a Secure and Safe America, told Reuters his group had been working to extend the Caesar sanctions and assessed they had bipartisan support to do so. 'We’ve been in talks over this for the past couple of months, although of course no political outcome in a town like Washington can be guaranteed 100 percent,' he said. Arab states have other potential avenues to reward Assad for distancing himself from Iran. A foreign diplomat based in the Gulf told Reuters both the UAE and Saudi Arabia had in recent months offered 'financial incentives' to Assad to split with Iran, saying they could not have been made without coordination with Washington. A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Syria, among other crises in the region, was a topic of discussion during Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to the UAE on Sunday. A Lebanese interlocutor said the UAE had also pledged funds to help Syria rebuild war-ravaged infrastructure as a way to 'pull Assad further away from Iran.' Iran has warned Assad not to stray far. The senior regional diplomat briefed by Tehran said Iran‘s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei conveyed a message via his senior adviser Ali Larijani, who told Assad: 'Do not forget the past.' 'The message served as a reminder to Assad of who his true allies are,' the diplomat said. ‘PLAYING WITH FIRE’ Since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7 last year precipitating war in Gaza, Iran has mobilized its network of allies to hit Israel. But Assad has largely avoided joining in, even as Israel struck Hezbollah targets in his country and bombed an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus. A US official said Assad had 'sat out' the war to avoid further Israeli strikes on Syria, and remained under 'tremendous pressure' not to allow Hezbollah to re-arm through his country. Israel has signaled that it still has eyes on Syria. When announcing the truce with Lebanon last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had been thwarting attempts by Iran, Hezbollah and Syria’s army to bring weapons into Lebanon. 'Assad must understand — he is playing with fire,' Netanyahu said.

Israel has 20,000 traumatized troops and not enough rehab staff	A survey by Maccabi showed that only 18% of its clients said they required mental health treatment in 2023, but 30% said they needed it in 2024. By JNS Israel’s ongoing war has produced about 20,000 soldiers and security forces personnel with post-traumatic stress disorder and a shortage of social workers to treat them, a defense official said on Sunday. Channel 12 revealed the data in an item aired about the Israeli Defense Ministry’s understaffed programs for treating psychological issues. The data suggest that troops traumatized after Oct. 7, 2023, constitute at least 3% of Israel’s military force. The ministry’s director general, Eyal Zamir, recently asked the Finance Ministry for a budget hike of tens of millions of shekels to hire 200 additional social workers to help traumatized soldiers. This was a 'strategic issue,' Zamir wrote, warning that the ministry’s Rehabilitation Department would not be able to accommodate the needs of the many soldiers who began requiring its mental-health services since the war began. So far, the treasury has added 50 social workers, it told Channel 12. Tally Shmuel, the chief psychiatrist at the Maccabi Healthcare Services HMO, said that the numbers of soldiers and others with PTSD are likely to increase in the coming months. The crisis affecting traumatized security personnel is part of a broader issue in society, where the consumption of anti-anxiety medication during the third quarter of 2024 increased by 20% over the same period from the previous year, Channel 12 reported, citing Health Ministry statistics. A survey by Maccabi showed that whereas only 18% of its clients said they required mental health treatment in 2023, the figure has risen to 30% in 2024. Among IDF reservists, 42% said that they required this treatment in 2024. In southern Israel, 70% of residents who are members of Maccabi told the provider they suffer from post-traumatic issues.

Israel uncovers 200 Iranian cyberattacks, phishing attempts again...	The Shin Bet warned that Iranian agents typically approach their targets through WhatsApp, Telegram, or email, crafting different cover stories for each targeted individual. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Israel uncovered around 200 Iranian cyberattacks attempts targeting Israeli civilians, including prominent figures, the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) disclosed on Monday. According to the Shin Bet, the hackers sought to access personal devices and information such as home addresses, personal connections, and places of frequent presence. 'This represents a significant additional threat in Iran’s campaign against Israel, aimed at carrying out assassination attacks,' a Shin Bet official said. This information, the Shin Bet stressed, was intended to facilitate attacks against these individuals using Israeli operatives recruited locally. In recent months, authorities thwarted nine attempts by Israelis recruited by Iran to carry out missions in Israel. The Shin Bet warned that Iranian agents typically approach their targets through WhatsApp, Telegram, or email, crafting different cover stories for each targeted individual. The goal is to convince their intended victim to download an application that either installs malware on their personal device or directs them to a fake website. Targets are then asked to provide login credentials for their personal or organizational email accounts, which the hackers can then use to gain access to the victim’s email or computer. Upon identifying the campaign and its scope, the Shin Bet warned the targeted individuals. In October, authorities arrested an Israeli man for spying on a nuclear scientist who Iranian agents wanted to assassinate, a couple who gathered intelligence on sensitive national infrastructure sites and high-profile academic figures, and a separate plot to assassinate the mayor of a large city and a scientist.

Hezbollah fires first missiles since ceasefire took effect	The Israel Defense Forces on Monday confirmed carrying out airstrikes on a Hezbollah missile production facility in the Beqaa Valley and other sites in the Hermel area of the Lebanon-Syria border used for weapons smuggling. By Pesach Benson, TPS Hezbollah fired two missiles at Mount Dov, an area of northern Israel where the borders of Israel, Lebanon and Syria converge on Monday. The barrage was the first since a ceasefire took effect on Wednesday morning. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the barrage, calling it 'a warning' to Israel. The rocket-fire came as the United States and France claimed that Israel was violating the ceasefire. According to Hebrew media reports, the issue is Israeli surveillance flights over Beirut, which Washington and Paris claim breaks the ceasefire. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar responded, saying,' 'The opposite is true – Israel is working to enforce the agreement in response to violations by Hezbollah, which require immediate action. For example, when armed Hezbollah terrorists are identified in southern Lebanon or when an attempt is made to transfer weapons.' Sa’ar warned his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barrot that Hezbollah must move its forces north of the Litani River or Israel would take further steps. The Israel Defense Forces on Monday confirmed carrying out airstrikes on a Hezbollah missile production facility in the Beqaa Valley and other sites in the Hermel area of the Lebanon-Syria border used for weapons smuggling. Meanwhile, IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari warned Iran not to use Syria’s civil war to smuggle weapons to Hezbollah. 'What is happening in Syria concerns Syria and not Israel,' Hagari told Sky News Arabic, adding that Israel 'will make sure that Iran does not smuggle weapons to Lebanon and Hezbollah.' 'Hezbollah was defeated in the campaign and it is necessary to make sure that it does not receive weapons from Iran through Syria,' Hagari said. 'And if they try to do it, we will act accordingly,' he stressed. On Sunday night, Israeli Air Force jets forced an Iranian plane in Syrian airspace suspected of carrying weapons to turn back to Tehran. Under the terms of the agreement, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its armed presence from areas of southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. Israeli forces will also withdraw from southern Lebanon in stages. The Lebanese Armed Forces is to be deployed in southern Lebanon including along the 120 km border with Israel, as will monitors from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Israel warns Iran not to rebuild Hezbollah’s forces	IDF says it has monitored Iran working in Syria to reinforce Assad regime as rebels capture key city, warns Tehran not to use foothold in Syria to rebuild Hezbollah amid ceasefire with Israel. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military on Monday warned Iran that the IDF has monitored Iranian forces operating in Syria to bolster the Assad regime, adding that Israel will not tolerate Tehran using its foothold on Israel's northern border to reinforce Hezbollah. Speaking with Sky News Arabia, IDF Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari accused Iran of attempting to transfer weapons to Hezbollah in an effort to help the terror group rebuild its operational capabilities during the ceasefire with Israel. 'The Iranian regime continues its attempts to transfer weapons to Hezbollah,' Hagari said, 'which Israel considers a direct threat to its national security.' Hagari hinted that should Israel detect Iran shipping weapons to Hezbollah, the IDF would take action, while declining to specify what form Israel’s response would take. 'We are making sure that Iranian weapons will not reach Lebanon or Hezbollah. If that happens, we will act appropriately.' The IDF chief spokesman appeared to signal that Israel would not interfere with Iranian efforts to strengthen the Syrian military, after anti-Assad rebels captured the city of Aleppo. 'We are closely following what is happening in Syria. We saw that the Iranian regime is sending reinforcements to Syria.' 'Syria belongs to the Syrians,' Hagari continued. 'What is happening in Syria concerns Syria and not Israel.' Hagari confirmed that Israel intercepted an Iranian plane Sunday and prevented it from landing at Damascus International Airport, claiming the aircraft was carrying weapons destined for Hezbollah. 'The measure was intended to prevent the smuggling of weapons to Hezbollah.' Turning to the ceasefire with Hezbollah, Hagari said that it would be implemented 'gradually.' 'We must ensure that these areas [near the Israeli border in southern Lebanon] are free of any terrorist bases to ensure our security and the security of our citizens.'

Justice and unity: The battle to protect Montreal’s Jewish commun...	While Montreal burned, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was notably absent from the crisis, attending a Taylor Swift concert. By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News Montreal is no stranger to antisemitism, but since October 7, the hostility against Jewish communities has reached alarming levels. From violent protests targeting synagogues and Jewish-owned businesses to direct threats of physical harm, the environment for Jews in Montreal has become increasingly dangerous. Anti-Israel protest near Mcgill University, Montreal, Canada. (Screenshot/Facebook) Yet, amidst the chaos, Jewish leaders, students, and activists are responding with resilience, legal action, and a firm commitment to their identity. At the forefront of this fight for justice are individuals like Michael Hollander, a commercial lawyer who has coordinated high-profile cases to defend Jewish institutions; Neil Oberman, a lawyer and the Conservative candidate for Mount Royal who has represented key cases in court; and Ysabella Elisheva Hazan, a young law graduate and activist advocating for open dialogue in the face of intimidation. Together, they represent a community fighting not only for its safety but for its right to exist unapologetically. A City at Boiling Point The rise in antisemitism in Montreal is no longer confined to rhetoric—it’s spilling into the streets. On November 29, a man entered a Jewish-owned business and shouted a tirade of threats, declaring, 'We’re gonna kill you one by one!' The incident was caught on video, and while a police report was filed, no arrests have been made. Anti-Israel protestor setting fire to effigy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during anti-Israel riot in Montreal, Friday, November 22, 2024 (Nioh Berg/X) This incident follows a violent pro-Palestinian riot in Montreal, where demonstrators set fire to an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, smashed store windows, and torched vehicles. These events are far from protests—they are hate-fueled rallies that incite violence. While Montreal burned, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was notably absent from the crisis, attending a Taylor Swift concert. His presence at the concert sent a starkly different message to the Jewish community and to Canadians at large about the priorities of the country’s leadership during a moment of rising tension and violence. Although Trudeau condemned the riots days later, stating, 'Acts of antisemitism, intimidation, and violence must be condemned wherever we see them,' his earlier statement that he would arrest Netanyahu if he visited Canada undermined his credibility. For many, these mixed messages embolden antisemitic actors who view Jewish identity as inseparable from the Jewish state. The Legal Battle: Protecting the Community As antisemitic hostility mounts, Michael Hollander has taken on a central role in coordinating legal protections for Montreal’s Jewish institutions. Montreal4Palestine poster at McGill (Courtesy) Hollander and Neil Oberman collaborated on obtaining an injunction to protect Federation CJA, Montreal’s largest Jewish organization, after hostile groups including Montreal4Palestine, Independent Jewish Voices, and the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) laid siege to its building on March 4, 2024. Protesters blocked the doors for hours, vandalized the property, assaulted attendees, and chanted, 'Death to the Jews.' The injunction, which Oberman represented in court, was later expanded to protect 27 Jewish institutions, including synagogues, schools, and community centers. These institutions now have a 50-meter buffer zone, offering a measure of safety from similar attacks. Hollander played a key role in coordinating efforts to ensure legal action was effective and consistent throughout this period. 'These aren’t protests—they are literal hate rallies meant to intimidate and silence,' Hollander explained. 'In 2024, Jews shouldn’t have to navigate this level of hostility just to attend school or synagogue.' The Legal Climate in Montreal Despite these challenges, Hollander noted that the courts have been largely receptive to cases addressing antisemitism. 'The courts have consistently shown they are ready to come to the aid of those who need it,' he said. However, he emphasized that obstacles often stem from administrative bodies and inconsistent enforcement of laws. 'Institutions like the Human Rights Commission have proven ineffective in addressing these issues,' Hollander explained. 'It’s not the courts that fail us—it’s the inconsistent application of the law by those tasked with upholding it.' Notable Moments in the Fight Hollander shared several pivotal moments from his work: • At the Spanish &#038; Portuguese Synagogue, Hollander coordinated efforts while Oberman represented in court to secure protections against another planned hate rally targeting the synagogue. • Deposing individuals from hate groups revealed their unwillingness to acknowledge the humanity of Jewish people, with one leader refusing to even shake his hand. • Supporting a Muslim student who faced threats for defending Jewish classmates underscored the shared stakes in combating hatred and extremism. 'These moments remind me how crucial our legal system is,' Hollander reflected. 'The stakes are not just about individual safety—they are about the community as a whole.' A Call for Leadership and Lawful Governance McGill University in Montreal (Shutterstock) As the challenges facing Jewish students and communities continue to mount, Neil Oberman, a lawyer and the Conservative candidate for Mount Royal, has emphasized the urgent need for decisive leadership at every level of government and within institutions. Oberman articulated his stance, stating: 'It is imperative that university administrators prioritize the safety of their students during their educational pursuits. There must be a strict zero-tolerance policy for any form of hatred or aggression on campus. My colleagues and I are committed to reinstating law and order in Montreal, as a secure environment is essential for effective learning.' He pointed to ineffective leadership at municipal, federal, and institutional levels as a key contributor to the rise in campus hostility, adding: 'In a society that values freedom and democracy, individuals should not feel apprehensive about leaving their homes, attending classes, or utilizing public facilities.' Oberman further outlined his vision for addressing these issues after the upcoming election cycle: 'Alongside Pierre Poilievre and the Conservative Party of Canada, we aspire to rejuvenate our nation after nine years of Liberal-NDP governance that has weakened our fundamental institutions and distorted public perceptions of Canada.' Oberman stressed that the current challenges are rooted in longstanding issues that predate the October 7th crisis. He criticized Ottawa’s ineffective leadership, stating that mixed messages from the federal government have sown confusion and allowed extremists to exploit the lack of clarity to propagate hateful ideologies. 'Such behavior will no longer be tolerated under a Conservative Party administration,' Oberman affirmed. 'Our communities cannot thrive if individuals driven by hate impede others from living freely each day. Only through collaboration with responsible Canadians and reforming our institutional frameworks can we hope to restore safety across Canada.' A Collective Stand Against Antisemitism Thousands of Jews gather in Montreal for the 'March for Jerusalem.' (Twitter Screenshot) Recognizing the need for broader community assistance, Hollander and a few colleagues helped establish the Quebec Legal Jewish Alliance. Comprising 300 lawyers, this organization provides legal services for less high-profile but equally critical cases. It assists students, teachers, employees, and others in Montreal who face antisemitism but may not have the resources to consult a lawyer. 'There’s a high volume of incidents in Montreal right now,' Hollander said. 'The Alliance steps in where individuals might otherwise feel powerless.' Oberman also represented two Jewish students at McGill University in a case against the McGill Encampment. While the case was ultimately unsuccessful, it underscored the extent of hostility faced by Jewish students on campus. Hollander continues to provide support on related issues and highlighted his ongoing lawsuit against Concordia University, which underscores the institutional failure to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence. Advocating for Dialogue: Ysabella Hazan’s Perspective While Hollander focuses on legal advocacy, activists like Ysabella Elisheva Hazan are addressing antisemitic narratives in the public sphere. A law graduate and founder of Decolonized Judean, an empowerment movement, Hazan has become a vocal advocate for Jewish empowerment and open dialogue. Hazan was scheduled to speak at an event at McGill University alongside Mosab Hassan Yousef, also known as the 'Son of Hamas.' However, after significant opposition and even death threats, McGill canceled all in-person events for the remainder of the year. While the event never took place, Hazan’s message remains clear: dialogue and resilience are the antidotes to suppression. 'Anti-colonial tactics of resistance won’t work on Jews, an indigenous people to Israel,' Hazan explained. 'The sooner this is understood, the quicker we can create meaningful dialogue and reduce polarization.' A Call to Action The resilience of Montreal’s Jewish community serves as a powerful reminder of the strength that comes from unity and determination. The fight against antisemitism requires more than legal victories or public advocacy—it demands a cultural shift. As Trudeau partied at a concert while Montreal burned, the question remains: will Canada rise to protect its Jewish citizens, or will it allow this wave of hatred to grow unchecked? For now, the Jewish community in Montreal continues to fight—with the courts, with their voices, and with their unwavering commitment to their identity. This is not just a battle for survival—it is a fight to affirm their place as equal members of Canadian society.

IDF soldiers doxxed, threatened with arrest in the Netherlands	The HRF posted the names and photographs of three Nahal Brigade soldiers who were present in the Netherlands on its X account. By World Israel News Staff A pro-Hamas organization revealed the full names and photographs of three IDF soldiers who recently traveled to the Netherlands, demanding that the Dutch government arrest them due to their purported complicity in alleged 'war crimes' in the Gaza Strip. The Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), which is based in Belgium, is dedicated to stalking Israeli soldiers on social media, then revealing their full names and locations when they travel outside of Israel. The organization regularly posts the soldiers' personal details on its X account, which is followed by 15,000 users. Notably, the HRF's founders have referred to Hamas as a 'liberation' force and demanded that the group be removed from the EU's list of terror organizations. Last week, the HRF posted the names and photographs of three Nahal Brigade soldiers who were present in the Netherlands on its X account. Because the soldiers had allegedly been involved in an operation which damaged the Rafah Crossing, they are complicit in 'weaponized famine,' the group said. In November, the HRF doxxed (publicly revealed personally details about) an IDF soldier visiting Cyprus. He was rushed out of the country in coordination with Israel's Foreign Ministry due to concerns that the post could lead to him being targeted by terror organizations. The HRF argues that IDF soldiers' mere presence in the Gaza Strip during the ongoing war is sufficient grounds for their arrests, pointing to the recent ICC warrants issued against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ex-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The organization is particularly focused on Israeli soldiers who hold additional citizenships, particularly those with European nationalities. 'Anti-Israel NGOs have pushed universal jurisdiction cases against Israeli military and government officials for years as a complement to their lobbying for ICC proceedings,' Anne Herzberg, a legal adviser to pro-Israel advocacy group NGO Monitor, told the Jerusalem Post. 'The shift by these groups to the targeting of thousands of lower-ranking dual-national Israelis has two purposes. First, these cases are about generating negative PR – to internationally tarnish the IDF by delegitimizing and criminalizing IDF service,' she added. 'The second purpose is to deter dual nationals from serving in the IDF for fear they might be subject to criminal proceedings if they return to their countries of origin.' South Africa recently pledged to prosecute any of its nationals who had fought in the Gaza Strip.

Biden administration joins France in accusing Israel of violating...	Israeli Foreign Minister rejects accusations IDF broke Lebanon deal, says Israel is enforcing agreement against violations by Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration has warned the Israeli government that its actions against Hezbollah in Lebanon constitute a violation of the nascent ceasefire agreement, Yedioth Aharanoth reported Monday. According to the report, which cited sources familiar with the administration's warning, the White House accused Israel of 'violations of the ceasefire agreement,' including 'visible and audible return of Israeli drones in the skies over Beirut.' The sources called for 'restraint from all sides' to ensure the ceasefire holds. Biden's special envoy to the Middle East, Amos Hochstein, reportedly transmitted the administration's warning to Jerusalem. Earlier, Israeli media outlets reported that France had also accused Israel of violating the truce. Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa'ar (New Hope) pushed back on the accusations, telling French Foreign Minister Jean Noël Barrot Monday that Israel's actions were in response to Hezbollah's violations of the ceasefire, and thus constituted enforcement of the deal, not its abrogation. 'Hezbollah's presence south of the Litani is a fundamental violation of the agreement. They must move north,' Saar told his French counterpart. Israel has also noted that the American-led committee tasked with ensuring that the ceasefire is maintained will not be operational until Tuesday, thus preventing Israel from reporting Hezbollah violations of the ceasefire. Since the ceasefire came into effect last Wednesday, the IDF has reported multiple violations of the truce by Hezbollah terrorists, and has used force on a number of occasions. Under the deal reached last Tuesday, Israeli forces can remain in Lebanese territory for up to two months. A side letter penned by the Bidne administration guarantees that the IDF may freely use force against security threats in southern Lebanon, while threats north of the Litani must first be addressed by the Lebanese army. Only if the Lebanese military is unable or unwilling to response is Israel enabled to act, and it is obliged to inform the U.S. ahead of time whenever possible.

Bereaved father files complaint against ex-IDF chief for inciteme...	Ya'alon's 'statements endanger our heroic soldiers, constitute incitement against the state, and directly harm national security,' says father of IDF soldier killed in the Gaza Strip last year. By World Israel News Staff A police complaint was filed by the father of a fallen soldier against a former IDF Chief of Staff and one-time Defense Minister, who recently accused the Israeli army of committing 'ethnic cleansing' in the Gaza Strip. Itzik Bonzel, an attorney whose son, Amit, was killed in battle in December 2023, asked the police to investigate recent remarks made by Moshe 'Boogie' Ya'alon, which under Israeli law could be considered incitement or intent to harm state security. Ya'alon, who was once the IDF's Chief of Staff and served as Defense Minister nearly a decade ago in a previous government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying in an interview with Democract Tv that the IDF is guilty of ethnic cleansing in the coastal enclave. Speaking to Channel 12, Ya'alon reiterated his remarks, claiming that 'far-right' elements within Netanyahu's coalition were intructing the IDF to 'carry out what are defined as war crimes.' Ya'alon added that the IDF is 'no longer the most moral army in the world.' In a press statemnet after filing the police complaint, Bonzel said that Ya'alon's 'hatred for Netanyahu has driven him mad, but that's his problem. Our problem is that his words amount to incitement and harm to state security.' Bonzel stressed that Ya'alon's 'statements endanger our heroic soldiers, constitute incitement against the state, and directly harm national security.' The bereaved father emphasized that 'the Israel Police and the Shin Bet [must] show the people of Israel that there is no selective enforcement against right-wing activists,' and therefore should 'arrest and interrogate individuals like Ya'alon, [Ehud] Barak, and others.' The attorney urged than 'an indictment be filed against Ya'alon for incitement and harming state security.' 'We will no longer sit idly by and allow people like him to trample on the honor of our heroic IDF soldiers,' Bonzel added.

IDF announces American-Israeli hostage was murdered Oct. 7	Omer Neutra was an IDF officer who was abducted with his tank crew, two of whom have already been declared dead. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF announced Monday that it had enough evidence to declare that American-Israeli lone soldier and hostage Omer Neutra has been dead since Hamas-led forces invaded Israel last October 7. Captain Neutra, 21, was a tank platoon commander in the Seventh Brigade’s 77th Battalion. He was stationed at the 'White House' outpost near the Gazan border when thousands of terrorists broke through the fence and he and his crew joined the battle to stop them. Video taken by the terrorists of the crew being hauled out of their tank was posted online quickly, and their tank going up in flames as jubilant terrorists celebrated around it became one of the iconic images of October 7. The IDF had declared long ago that both tank driver Shaked Dahan and loader Oz Daniel had died in Hamas captivity. On the video itself, a burst of gunfire can be heard and then one soldier is seen lying still on the ground. The whole crew was taken into Gaza. While it was suspected that Neutra had also been murdered, his death was only recently determined by a group of specialists who spent months examining all the findings and information uncovered over the months, and then presented them to the Chief Rabbi who agreed with their professional assessment. The fate of tank gunner Nimrod Cohen, who was seized as well, is as yet officially unknown. His father told Ynet Tuesday that the family has received 'along the way' some unspecified 'indications' that their son is still alive. Neutra’s parents, Ronen and Orna, had addressed the Republican National Convention in July, trying to raise awareness and support for all the hostages. They told the crowd that the soon-to-be reelected president Donald Trump had called the American-Israeli couple personally shortly after their son was abducted along with 250 others during the day the Palestinian terrorists massacred 1,200 people, sparking the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. The couple had just spoken Sunday at a New York rally for the hostages, calling on President Joe Biden and President-elect Trump to combine forces to create a deal enabling all the 101 remaining abductees to return home, including the approximately 40% who are already known to be dead. 'Seize the moment, work together, before January,' they pleaded. 'This can be a moment that unites us all.' Neutra had been born and raised in Long Island but had been 'the most Sabra [Israeli] possible,' his friends said of him. It was 'clear to him,' said his parents, that he would serve in the IDF, even if it meant being far from his parents and brother. Mourning him, Defense Minister Yisrael Katz said Monday, 'Omer, who grew up in New York and chose to immigrate to Israel out of a deep sense of mission, fell in a heroic battle near Nir Oz on October 7, 2023 and was kidnapped to the Gaza Strip by Hamas murderers.' 'Omer's life story and dedication represent the best and strongest of us as a people,' he added. 'A fighter who stood bravely in the battle &#8230; and sacrificed his life for the security of the State of Israel against the worst of our enemies.' The Hostages and Missing Families Forum eulogized Omer as a person 'who loved sports, played soccer, basketball and volleyball and was captain of the teams at school. His family and friends have said that he is a warm, optimistic person who loved people and would ‘light up the room’ whenever he entered.'

UK announces $9m rise in funding for UNRWA	It will come on top of nearly $44 million that the UK has already pledged to transfer to UNRWA this year. By Canaan Lindor, JNS The United Kingdom will add £19 million ($24 million) to its funding for Gaza, with 37% of that sum going to the terror-linked UNRWA aid agency for Palestinians, the government in London announced on Monday. The Foreign Office announced the budget hike in a statement ahead of a visit this week to Egypt, the Palestinian Authority and Israel by International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds. The $9 million addition in funding for UNRWA, whose activity was recently outlawed in Israel because Jerusalem considers it a Hamas instrument, is meant to address humanitarian needs in Gaza, where winter conditions could worsen living standards. It will come on top of nearly $44 million that the UK has already pledged to transfer to UNRWA this year. According to Israel, more than 450 people belonging to terrorist organizations in Gaza, mainly Hamas, were also employed by UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. Critics of UNRWA say its unique definition of a Palestinian refugee, where the status is passed down to the next generation forever, even for people who become citizens of other countries, is designed to undo Zionism. UNRWA officials have denied this. On Oct. 28, the Knesset passed laws banning UNRWA from being present in Israel and outlawing cooperation by Israeli officials with the agency. The remaining $15 million of the $24 million in new funding will be allocated to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the World Food Programme (WFP), the Foreign Office said. This funding, part of a broader £99 million ($126 million) commitment to what the British government refers to as the 'Occupied Palestinian Territories' this fiscal year, is earmarked for health, water and sanitation services, the British government said. Dodds is also set to visit a Palestinian community that 'is subject to settler violence and is at risk of demolition and displacement,' the statement said.

Netanyahu’s wife meets with Trump, discusses plight of hostages	Sara Netanyahu dines with President-elect Donald Trump at his Florida golf club, speaking with the incoming president regarding the plight of hostages held in Gaza, and the 'fight against the axis of evil.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wife, Sara Netanyahu, met with former President and President-elect Donald Trump in Florida Sunday, Mrs. Netanyahu and the Trump campaign's deputy director of communications said Monday morning. Sara Netanyahu is in the midst of a 20-day visit to Miami, Florida, visiting her son, Yair Netanyahu. On Sunday night, Mrs. Netanyahu dined with the incoming president at his Mar-a-Lago Gulf Club. Margo Martin, who served as press secretary during the first Trump administration and Deputy Director of Communications during the 2024 presidential campaign, posted an image of the two at a table in the club's dining hall to X/Twitter. 'President Donald Trump and Sara Netanyahu having dinner at Trump International Golf Course tonight,' Martin tweeted. Mrs. Netanyahu also uploaded the photo to her Instagram account, writing that she had responded to an invitation by the incoming president. 'I attended a dinner meeting at President-elect Donald Trump’s golf club, to which I was invited by him. I congratulated the President on his historic victory in the elections.' The two discussed the plight of Israeli hostages still held captive in the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu wrote, as well as the war against the 'axis of evil.' 'During the meeting, which was warm and friendly, we discussed many topics, including the steadfast friendship between Israel and the United States and the importance of continuing to nurture the unique bond between our nations.' 'I also brought to the President’s attention the immense suffering Israel endured on October 7th and the inhumanity of Hamas terrorists holding our citizens hostage under harsh conditions. I emphasized the urgent need to act for their release and swift return.' 'We also discussed the strategic importance of Israel’s victory in the fight against the axis of evil, for a more stable and secure future in the Middle East and around the world.'

Israel forces Iranian plane to reverse course over Syria	According to a 2022 report by the Alma Research and Education Center, Mahan Air serves as the Islamic Republic’s main cover for transporting weapons. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli fighter jets on Sunday night intercepted an Iranian plane over Syria suspected to be transporting weapons to Hezbollah, forcing it to return to Tehran, according to Hebrew media reports. The operation was part of efforts to maintain the Nov. 27 ceasefire agreement that ended over a year of hostilities between Israel and the Iranian-backed terror group. Israeli Air Force fighter jets. Credit: Israeli Defense Ministry Spokesperson’s Office. The 'Letter of Guarantees,' an annex to the agreement, underscores the United States’ commitment to collaborating with Israel to counter Iran’s destabilizing activities in Lebanon, including halting the transfer of weapons, proxies and materials into Lebanon from Iranian territory. Additional provisions in the two-and-a-half-page U.S.-Israel side deal reportedly include guarantees of Israeli operational freedom against Hezbollah violations of the ceasefire. The Israel Defense Forces is authorized to counter immediate threats in Southern Lebanon, such as observed preparations for a Hezbollah rocket launch, and also to address emerging threats, for example the digging of new tunnels or arms transfers, if Lebanon’s government is unwilling or unable to act. According to a 2022 report by the Alma Research and Education Center, Mahan Air serves as the Islamic Republic’s main cover for transporting weapons. Jerusalem has struck Hezbollah weapons-smuggling operations in Syria numerous times during the war and since the ceasefire took effect. The IAF on Saturday attacked terrorist infrastructure along the Syria-Lebanon border that according to Israel Hezbollah was 'actively using' to smuggle arms. 'The strike was conducted after identifying the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah from Syria to Lebanon, even after the ceasefire agreement, constituting a threat to the State of Israel and a violation of the terms of the truce,' the Israel Defense Forces said. The military accused the Iranian proxy of smuggling weapons through civilian crossing points, with the backing of Syria’s Assad regime. Hours before the ceasefire went into effect last week, Israel for the first time carried out airstrikes targeting Lebanon’s three northern border crossings with Syria. Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, responsible for the terrorist group’s weapons smuggling into Lebanon from Iran via Syria, has been a frequent target of Israeli strikes, according to the IDF. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Jerusalem is constantly monitoring the situation in Syria, after Sunni jihadist rebels over the weekend took control of Aleppo, the country’s second-largest city. 'We are determined to protect Israel’s vital interests and preserve the achievements of the war,' Netanyahu told Israel Defense Forces recruits at the Tel Hashomer induction center in Ramat Gan. 'In this regard, we are strictly enforcing the ceasefire agreement. Every violation is met with a strong IDF response. That has been the case and will continue to be the case. We will maintain Israel’s security.' IDF thwarts ceasefire violations Troops continue to address ceasefire violations as they stay in their positions for the next two months during the gradual drawdown of ground forces in Southern Lebanon. According to the terms of the truce, Hezbollah must retreat north of the Litani River. In the past 24 hours, the IDF conducted operations at multiple locations in Southern Lebanon to neutralize terrorist threats. On Saturday, soldiers eliminated several armed terrorists near a church. Over the past day, IDF troops operated in several locations in southern Lebanon to remove threats to the State of Israel that were in violation of the ceasefire agreement conditions. IDF troops identified several armed terrorists adjacent to a church in southern Lebanon… pic.twitter.com/FbberXLIlT &mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) December 1, 2024 According to the IDF, they were operatives in Hezbollah’s Khiam ground defense, anti-tank missile and artillery units, and had fired at the troops from the church. Israeli forces searched the church following the incident, locating a tunnel shaft containing weapons. 'The IDF remains in Southern Lebanon and acts against any threat to the State of Israel,' the military stated. France accuses Israel of ceasefire violations Paris, a member of the Washington-led monitoring mechanism overseeing the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire agreement, has accused Jerusalem of committing 52 ceasefire violations, according to Hebrew media reports on Sunday which cited French diplomatic sources. The sources alleged that Israel had bypassed the established channels for reporting violations before taking action. The reports also claim that three Lebanese civilians were killed and highlight an increase in Israeli drone activity, claiming that low-altitude flights over Beirut had resumed. Paris is reportedly in ongoing communication with Lebanese Army Chief of Staff Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Najib Mikati to address these developments. 'The Lebanese are fully committed to upholding the ceasefire and preventing Hezbollah from reestablishing its presence in southern Lebanon, but they need time to demonstrate their efforts,' a French official told Ynet on Sunday. According to a separate report by i24NEWS on Sunday, Jerusalem stated that the agreement’s implementation mechanism 'will begin to accelerate' on Monday and Tuesday. An Israeli diplomatic source emphasized that 'any violation will be met with a significant response, as is already happening on the ground.'

Navigating conflict: Pelican tracking aims to reduce bird-aircraf...	Israel’s location at the crossroads of three continents makes it a critical stopover for birds traveling between breeding grounds in Europe and Asia and wintering areas in Africa. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s northern skies are bustling, with pelican migration overlapping with Air Force missions in Lebanon and Syria. To prevent bird-aircraft collisions, the Israeli Nature and Parks Authority and Air Force on Sunday embarked on the most extensive bird-monitoring effort in the nation’s history, equipping 30 pelicans with transmitters to track their migration routes. 'Our skies are among the busiest in the world for both birds and airplanes,' said Ohad Hatzofa, an avian ecologist with the Nature and Parks Authority. 'This naturally creates conflicts between the two.' Israel’s location at the crossroads of three continents makes it a critical stopover for birds traveling between breeding grounds in Europe and Asia and wintering areas in Africa. Each year, hundreds of millions of birds from over 500 species pass through Israel. In recent years, large birds like pelicans frequently trigger radar systems, raising alarms over potential unidentified flying objects. This year, with Israeli airspace particularly congested — in the past year, the Air Force has logged over 11,000 takeoffs for strikes in Lebanon — these misidentifications could pose serious threats to both pilots and wildlife. 'The data we collect will provide invaluable insights into their behavior and help mitigate risks,' Hatzofa explained. Israel plays a critical role in the migration of common pelicans, a species facing mounting threats as their natural habitats shrink. 'Fall 2024 is the peak of the pelican season,' noted Dr. Yariv Malihi, Central District Ecologist at the Nature and Parks Authority. 'They stop here to feed before continuing their journey. As their habitats in places like Turkey dry up or become unsafe due to hunting, Israel has become one of their last refuges.' Recognizing the pelicans’ vulnerability, Israel has taken steps to protect these majestic birds. The Nature and Parks Authority, in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, stocks water bodies with non-edible fish. This strategy provides vital nourishment for the pelicans while reducing conflicts with fish farms. For the Air Force, tracking the pelicans is a matter of safety and operational efficiency. 'Accurately predicting the pelicans’ migration routes allows us to avoid dangerous overlaps between their paths and our flight operations,' said Dr. Yotam Orhan, Head of the Ecology and Ornithology Section at the Air Force. This year has seen over 40,000 pelicans migrate through Israel, with around 2,300 currently present. However, their stay has been notably shorter — about 40% less than in previous years. 'We still don’t know why,' said Dr. Amit Dolev, an ecologist in the Northern District of the Nature and Parks Authority. 'This is one of many questions we hope to answer through our ongoing monitoring efforts.' The transmitters provide a wealth of information, enabling researchers to pinpoint key feeding and resting areas. This data will guide future conservation and operational strategies. Common pelicans are listed as vulnerable in many parts of their range, and Israel’s waterways serve as the pelicans’ last major stop before they embark on a grueling journey across the Sinai and African deserts to their wintering grounds in East Africa.

Israeli hacker faces extradition to the US from Norway	The man was convicted for making some 2,000 calls under a false identity claiming explosives were hidden on planes, causing massive delays. By JNS An Israeli who served seven years in an Israeli prison for hacking a host of American institutions as a minor was arrested last week in Norway and is now facing extradition to the United States, according to Hebrew media reports. The Israeli, who was released from jail after serving seven years of a 10-year sentence, had traveled to Norway and applied for political asylum, according to Channel 12 News. His request was dismissed and he was apprehended in the wake of an extradition warrant filed against him by the FBI in 2017, which Israeli authorities rejected at the time. The man was convicted for making some 2,000 calls under a false identity, including to police stations in major U.S. cities, falsely claiming that explosives had been planted in airplanes, causing emergency landings, the rerouting of flights and the evacuation of thousands of passengers from airports, according to the report. He also hacked into computers in airports, hospitals and Jewish community centers across the United States. Following a joint investigation by the FBI and the Israel Police’s Lahav 433, known as 'the Israeli FBI,' the Juvenile Court in Tel Aviv sentenced him to 10 years in prison in 2017. 'Unfortunately, the United States apparently decided to ‘confirm the kill’ and unjustly demand after a long time the extradition of my client from Norway to the United States, despite the fact that my client has already paid his dues for many years in incarceration,' said the man’s lawyer, Nir Yaslovitzh, according to Channel 12. Israel should do 'everything possible for the immediate release of my client from detention and not turn a deaf ear in the face of the ongoing injustice … waged against him,' he added.

Egypt hosts Hamas in new Gaza ceasefire push, looting halts aid	White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said he thought the chances of a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza were now more likely. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Hamas leaders held talks with Egyptian security officials on Sunday in a fresh push for a ceasefire in the Gaza war, two Hamas sources said, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set to convene his security cabinet on the matter, two Israeli officials said. The Hamas visit to Cairo was the first since the United States announced on Wednesday it would revive efforts in collaboration with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza, that would include a hostage deal. White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said he thought the chances of a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza were now more likely. '(Hamas) are isolated. Hezbollah is no longer fighting with them, and their backers in Iran and elsewhere are preoccupied with other conflicts,' he told CNN on Sunday. 'So I think we may have a chance to make progress, but I’m not going to predict exactly when it will happen … we’ve come so close so many times and not gotten across the finish line.' Residents said the military blew up clusters of houses in the northern Gaza areas of Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, where Israeli forces have operated since October. The military says it has killed hundreds of Hamas terrorists in that part of Gaza as it fights to stop the faction regrouping. It has also lost around 30 soldiers there in combat with Hamas fighters over the past two months, a relatively high death toll. Hamas does not provide details on its own fatalities. The halting of aid deliveries through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing came almost two weeks after a large shipment was hijacked on the same route. UNRWA’s Lazzarini said it was Israel’s responsibility 'as occupying power' to protect aid workers and supplies, and that the humanitarian operation had become 'unnecessarily impossible' due to what he said were Israeli restrictions. COGAT, the Israeli military department responsible for aid transfers, denies it is hindering humanitarian relief into Gaza, saying there is no limit on supplies for civilians and blaming delays on the United Nations, which it says is inefficient.

‘I believe in the justice system,’ Biden says, as he pardons his ...	The pardon, per a White House announcement, relates to any offenses against the country that Hunter Biden 'has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from Jan. 1, 2014 through Dec. 1, 2024.' By JNS U.S. President Joe Biden stated on Sunday night that he hopes Americans will understand why he, as 'a father and a president,' decided to pardon his son Hunter Biden. 'Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively and unfairly prosecuted,' Biden stated. 'Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form,' the president said. 'Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.' Biden and his administration have previously issued very strong statements about gun control and the importance of holding offenders accountable for gun crimes. The pardon, per a White House announcement, relates to any offenses against the country that Hunter Biden 'has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from Jan. 1, 2014 through Dec. 1, 2024.' Those include but are 'not limited to all offenses charged or prosecuted (including any that have resulted in convictions) by Special Counsel David C. Weiss in Docket No. 1:23-cr-00061-MN in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and Docket No. 2:23-CR-00599-MCS-1 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California,' the president added.' Less than a month ago, a reporter asked Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, during a Nov. 8 press briefing about a potential pardon. 'His son, Hunter, is also up for being sentenced next month,' the reporter said. 'Does the president have any intention of pardoning him?' 'We’ve been asked that question multiple times,' Jean-Pierre said. 'Our answer stands, which is no.' 'Everybody in America knew this day was coming,' wrote Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.). David Greenfield, CEO of the Met Council, wrote that the pardon was 'understandable. But now as Democrats, we certainly have no moral high ground for any of the Trump pardons that Democrats objected to.' The 'timing for the Biden pardon of Hunter couldn’t have been worse,' wrote Josh Kraushaar, editor-in-chief of Jewish Insider. Others suggested that Trump would pardon all of the rioters who were at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. 'Joe Biden has always been a venal liar who utilized his political power to pursue familial gain. So, of course, he’s pardoning Hunter,' wrote Ben Shapiro, a prominent Jewish conservative podcaster and writer. 'He was always going to pardon Hunter. Hunter was the bagman.' ‘Tried to break me’ Biden stated on Sunday that the charges against Hunter Biden 'came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.' 'Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the courtroom—with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process,' he said. 'Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter’s cases.' 'No reasonable person, who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases, can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son—and that is wrong,' Biden said. 'In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me—and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.' The president said that he has followed 'a simple principle' for his entire career, which is to 'just tell the American people the truth.' 'They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice—and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further,' he said. 'I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.' Over the weekend, Biden was also photographed carrying an anti-Israel book as he exited a bookstore in Nantucket, Mass.

Israeli police crackdown on illegal Muslim call to prayer in mixe...	National Security Minister defends decision to confiscate speakers from mosques which violate noise laws with night-time call to prayer in mixed cities. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli police have begun cracking down on illegal muezzin calls to prayer by mosques in mixed cities across Israel, enforcing noise laws against mosques which violate laws limiting the use of speakers at night. For decades, Israeli mosques across the country have flouted noise restriction laws, which bar noise pollution between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. The use of speaker systems in mixed cities, or by mosques in villages against to Jewish communities, has sparked ongoing complaints, in particular with regard to the night-time and early morning calls to prayer. While multiple efforts to pass legislation banning the use of speakers in houses have worship have failed, in part to due opposition from some ultra-Orthodox lawmakers, existing noise pollution laws enable police to confiscate speakers and public announcement systems used to violate the law. Under the instructions of National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit), Israeli police have been enforcing the law recently in a number of cities and towns, with officers in some instances confiscating mosque speakers. 'The law provides the option to confiscate the audio systems,' Ben-Gvir wrote to the police department in a letter publicized over the weekend. 'It’s an effective tool for deterrence. The moment we use this tool, it will echo across the [Arab] sector.' 'At the end of the day, we need to get results in the field.' The minister is also working to promote legislation which would increase fines against mosques which repeatedly violate the noise pollution law. Multiple Arab lawmakers, including Hadash-Ta'al chief Ayman Odeh and United Arab List (Ra'am) chairman Mansour Abbas, castigated the new directive, calling it a provocation. MK Ahmad Tibi (Hadash-Ta'al), took to X to accuse Ben-Gvir of implementing the policy in order to 'deepen the ongoing oppression of the Arab public.' Ben-Gvir responded on X, defending his decision to enforce the law. 'I received dozens of inquiries from residents in the cities involved, who told me explicitly, you are saving us - keep going. I have no intention of blinking. I tell Ahmed Tibi, Ayman Odeh and Mansour Abbas not to threaten the State of Israel with violence. As they do in Europe, as they do in every reformed country in the world, as they do in Arab countries, we also need to address and enforce the issue of noise in mosques.'

Daniel Rakov, an expert on Russian policy in the Middle East and retired IDF colonel, says the attacks in Syria can hinder assistance to Iran and Hezbollah. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Daniel Rakov, a senior research fellow for the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, wrote on X that the rebel attack on Syrian government forces in Aleppo is 'ostensibly good for Israel.' Rakov, an expert on Russian policy in the Middle East and retired IDF colonel, says the attacks in Syria can hinder assistance to Iran and Hezbollah. He wrote, 'The fall of northern Syria to the rebels undermines the infrastructure of both the Iranians and Hezbollah in the region, complicating their efforts to rebuild Hezbollah.' Syrian President Bashar Assad will presumably be more concerned with fighting for the survival of his government than funding terror groups that threaten Israel. 'As Assad becomes more defensive, fighting for the survival of his regime, supporting Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon will take a backseat,' Rakov wrote. Meanwhile, Israel will have more leverage to take action in Syria. Rakov also noted that Moscow, Syria's ally, found the attack by rebels 'very embarrassing.' He said the Russians were surprised by the swiftness of the rebels in Idlib and that Syria will more likely leverage the few Russian forces it has rather than take the time to assist Hezbollah and Iran in its conflict with Israel. Rakov discusses reports that Assad asked Putin for assistance directly and that glide bombs have been transferred to a Russian-operated Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. He adds that Russia is downplaying the Syrian incident in its media and is saying its security is not responsible for the defense failure in Aleppo. Rakov suggests that Israel could leverage the disorder in Syria to attack strategic targets in the country. However, he warned that instability in Syria may lead to a takeover by radical groups such as ISIS and may cause Syria to open the door to Iran as it struggles to seek assistance from Russia and Turkey.

France accuses Israel of violating ceasefire in Lebanon – report	Paris warned both Israel and Hezbollah 'against actions that endanger the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A French diplomatic source reportedly accused Israel of not following the correct procedure for addressing violations in the ceasefire agreement when it struck against a number of Hezbollah targets, according to Kan news. Following this claim, Paris warned both Israel and Hezbollah 'against actions that endanger the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.' Israel has insisted that it will retaliate for violations against the terms of a ceasefire agreement, including Hezbollah's unauthorized transfer of weapons. In the ceasefire agreement is a 'side letter' signed by the US and Israel that would give the Jewish State the right to enforce the deal and defend against emerging threats from Hezbollah. The letter acknowledges Israel's right to act militarily if the terms of the agreement are broken, although, beyond southern Lebanon, it can only do so in coordination with the Lebanese army. The letter also stipulates that Israel must inform the US before taking military action to address infractions. The Kan report also indicates that Paris claims Hezbollah has violated the ceasefire as well. When the Lebanon ceasefire agreement was announced last week, Israel requested that France not be granted a role in the monitoring of the agreement, given the country's position on the ICC arrest warrants issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. However, since the Lebanese side insisted on France's involvement, a compromise was reached in which the US would enforce the agreement, and France would have a lesser role in monitoring its enforcement. According to the agreement, Hezbollah would be required to withdraw its forces from the Israeli border and north of the Litani River. The group would also be obligated to disarm, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Additionally, a U.S.-led committee would be tasked with monitoring compliance with the ceasefire. Lastly, Israel would retain the right to take military action in Lebanon in response to violations of the ceasefire, but only after the committee has exhausted all efforts to restore peace. The agreement would unfold in three stages: In the first stage, a ceasefire would take effect, during which Hezbollah would withdraw from the southern bank of the Litani River. In the second stage, Israeli forces would pull back from Lebanese territory. Finally, in the third stage, Israel and Lebanon would enter negotiations over disputed border areas.

Syrian rebels seize control of Aleppo in surprise offensive	Damascus has since attempted to regain control through air power, with both Syrian and Russian warplanes launching strikes on rebel positions in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. By Jewish Breaking News Syrian opposition forces stunned government troops this weekend with a lightning offensive that has captured most of Aleppo. According to CNN, the attack began with rebels sweeping through villages east of Aleppo, meeting unexpectedly light resistance. On Saturday morning, armed fighters were celebrating in Aleppo’s central square, with video showing them waving opposition flags and shouting 'God is great' in Arabic. By Saturday evening, rebels had seized both the city’s airport and its historic citadel. Except for a few northeastern neighborhoods still held by government forces and Iranian militias, most of Syria’s second-largest city has been captured by rebel forces. The opposition implemented a 24-hour curfew, claiming it was necessary to protect residents and property. Damascus has since attempted to regain control through air power, with both Syrian and Russian warplanes launching strikes on rebel positions in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. The Syrian Defense Ministry confirmed these joint operations, targeting what they termed 'terrorist gatherings and supply lines.' At least one airstrike near al-Basil roundabout resulted in civilian casualties, including severe burn victims. As the situation evolved, Kurdish forces exploited the chaos to expand beyond their traditional two neighborhoods, leading to clashes with the rebel alliance. Some opposition groups now threaten to target Kurdish-held territories in northern Aleppo province. The timing of this offensive appears strategic, coming as Syria’s key ally Russia remains focused on Ukraine and Iran faces increasing pressure from Israeli operations. If the rebels successfully oust President Bashar al-Assad, it could reshape the future of Syria, a nation whose civil war has claimed over 300,000 civilian lives since it began during the 2011 Arab Spring.

Israeli High Court approves military burial in civilian cemetery ...	A decorated soldier with a 20-year career in the Israel Air Force, Dagan served as a combat navigator during the Second Lebanon War and later in Unit 8200 of the Intelligence Directorate as a reservist. By Pesach Benson, TPS In a landmark ruling, Israel’s High Court of Justice on Sunday approved a military burial in a civilian cemetery for Maj. (res.) Asaf Dagan, an Israel Air Force navigator who committed suicide in October after battling severe post-traumatic stress disorder. The decision follows a legal struggle between Dagan’s family and military authorities over burial rights and recognition. Traditionally, Israeli military regulations reserve full military burials in military cemeteries for soldiers who die while on active duty. 'In light of the complexity of the issue from legal, human, public, and moral perspectives, the court proposed a compromise,' the High Court said in its ruling. A decorated soldier with a 20-year career in the Israel Air Force, Dagan served as a combat navigator during the Second Lebanon War and later in Unit 8200 of the Intelligence Directorate as a reservist. Despite struggling with PTSD, his family noted that he consistently fulfilled his reserve duties. Dagan, 48, shot himself on October 23. The ruling sets a precedent for recognizing the lingering impacts of military service, such as PTSD even after soldiers leave active duty. The Defense Ministry and the Israel Defense Forces have committed to further discussions with Dagan’s family to resolve outstanding issues, including the placement of a military tombstone, Dagan’s inclusion on the IDF’s memorial website, and the organization of an annual remembrance ceremony. PTSD is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. People with PTSD may avoid situations or things that remind them of the traumatic event, and they may have negative changes in beliefs and feelings. The condition is typically managed with therapy and medication. Since Hamas’s October 7 attacks, the clinic at Tel Aviv University’s National Center for Post Trauma & Resilience say they have been flooded with a weekly average of 40 new requests for treatment.

Can AI understand medical complexity? Israeli researchers questio...	Most AI models, including those specifically trained on medical datasets, performed poorly, often no better than random guessing. By Pesach Benson, TPS As the integration of artificial intelligence into medicine advances, there is also a growing interest in using AI models to interpret complex medical information, a step beyond AI’s traditional medical uses. AI’s current medical tasks are more about task automation and pattern recognition, used in applications such as chatbots that answer patient queries, algorithms predicting disease, synthetic data generation for privacy, and educational tools for medical students. But despite these strides, interpreting medical information involves a higher level of comprehension and distinction of complex medical concepts and comes with life-or-death consequences. A study recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Computers in Biology and Medicine by researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev sheds new light on the performance of AI models in deciphering medical data, revealing both their potential and significant limitations. Doctoral student Ofir Ben Shoham and Dr. Nadav Rappaport from the university’s Department of Software and Information Systems Engineering conducted a study to evaluate how effectively AI models comprehend medical concepts. They developed a dedicated evaluation tool called 'MedConceptsQA,' which includes over 800,000 questions spanning various levels of complexity. This tool was designed to assess the models’ ability to interpret medical codes and concepts, such as diagnoses, procedures, and medications. Questions in *MedConceptsQA* were categorized into three levels of difficulty: Easy, requiring basic medical knowledge; medium, demanding a moderate understanding of medical concepts; and difficult, which tested the ability to discern nuanced differences between closely related medical terms. The results were surprising. Most AI models, including those specifically trained on medical datasets, performed poorly, often no better than random guessing. However, some general-purpose models, such as ChatGPT-4, outperformed others, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 60%. While better than random, this performance still falls short of the precision required for critical medical decisions. 'It often seems that models specifically trained for medical needs achieve accuracy levels close to random guessing. Even specialized training on medical data does not necessarily translate to superior performance in interpreting medical codes,' said Rappaport. Interestingly, general-purpose AI models like ChatGPT-4 and Llama 3-70B outperformed specialized clinical models, such as OpenBioLLM-70B, by 9–11%. This highlighted both the limitations of current clinical models and the adaptability of general-purpose models, despite their lack of a medical focus, the researchers said. The study shows that AI models need more specialized training on diverse, high-quality clinical data to better understand medical codes and concepts. This could lead to the development of more effective AI tools. With further advancements, AI could help in triaging patients, recommending treatments based on medical history, or flagging potential errors in diagnoses. The findings also suggests that AI models need better training to handle the complexity of medical coding, which could streamline administrative tasks and improve efficiency in healthcare systems. 'Our benchmark serves as a valuable resource for evaluating large language models’ abilities to interpret medical codes and distinguish between concepts,' explained Ben Shoham. 'It allows us to test new models as they are released and compare them with existing ones.' The post Can AI understand medical complexity?

Trump pushing for Gaza ceasefire by January 20th – report	Senator Lindsey Graham, an ally of President-elect Donald Trump, warns Israeli leaders not to assume Trump will back plans to annex, resettle Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff President-elect Donald Trump has signaled that he wants Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire deal by the time he enters office on January 20th, a senior Republican lawmaker and Trump ally said last week. In a report published last Friday by Axios, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said that the 45th president - and soon to be 47th - has repeatedly said that he wants to see a deal freeing the remaining 101 Israeli hostages and ending the war in Gaza reached by inauguration day next month. 'Trump is more determined than ever to release the hostages and supports a ceasefire that includes a hostage deal. He wants to see it happening now,' Graham was quoted as saying. 'I want people in Israel and in the region to know that Trump is focused on the hostages issue. He wants the killing to stop and the fighting to end.' Graham, a pro-Israel figure in the upper chamber of Congress, expressed optimism that the Biden administration can cooperate with the Trump transition team to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. The senator spoke with Axios after returning to the U.S. following a pair of trips to the Middle East, during which he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Turning to plans proposed by Israeli government ministers to resettle and annex the Gaza Strip, Graham warned against assuming they would have the incoming president's support. 'I think he should talk to Trump and hear what he wants,' Graham said of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who last month called for Israel to adopt a policy of promoting voluntary mass emigration of Arabs from Gaza. 'If you haven't spoken to him, I wouldn't put words in his mouth.' 'The best insurance policy against Hamas is not an Israeli reoccupation of Gaza but a reform in the Palestinian society. The only ones who can do that are the Arab countries.'

After aid convoys looted by armed gangs of Gazans, UNRWA announces it has halted transfer of aid to Gaza through the primary crossing from Israel. By World Israel News Staff The United Nations relief agency tasked with supporting Palestinian Arabs has halted the transfer of aid to the Gaza Strip via the primary border crossing between Israel and the coastal enclave, following a spate of looting incidents. On Sunday, Philippe Lazzarini commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) took to X/Twitter to announce that his agency has suspended aid transfers to Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing. 'We are pausing the delivery of aid through Kerem Shalom, the main crossing point for humanitarian aid into Gaza,' Lazzarini wrote. Lazzarini noted that an entire convoy of food trucks was looted by armed Gazan gangs after entering the Strip on Saturday, adding that this was not the first time aid convoys had been hijacked or looted en masse. 'The road out of this crossing has not been safe for months. On 16 November, a large convoy of aid trucks was stolen by armed gangs. Yesterday, we tried to bring in a few food trucks on the same route. They were all taken.' 'This difficult decision comes at a time hunger is rapidly deepening. The delivery of humanitarian aid must never be dangerous or turn into an ordeal.' Blaming Israel for the 'breakdown in law and order' in the Gaza Strip, which was ruled by the Hamas terror organization prior to Israel's invasion, Lazzarini tasked the IDF with providing security to aid convoys carrying goods into Gaza. 'The responsibility of protection of aid workers + supplies is with the State of Israel as the occupying power. They must ensure aid flows into Gaza safely & must refrain from attacks on humanitarian workers.' 'I call once again for a #ceasefire that would also secure the delivery of safe & uninterrupted aid to people in need.'

Trump taps Kash Patel as nominee for FBI director	Patel has served as chief of staff to the acting Secretary of Defense and has held roles in counterterrorism and intelligence operations. By Jewish Breaking News President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Kash Patel as his nominee for FBI Director. Patel, a former federal prosecutor and key figure in Trump’s first administration, is known for his aggressive stance against government bureaucracy and promises sweeping changes, including the creation of a transparency office to release records on the JFK assassination, 9/11, and similar events. Patel rose to prominence while working as an aide to Rep. Devin Nunes on the House Intelligence Committee, playing a key role in challenging the Russia investigation. He later served as chief of staff to the acting Secretary of Defense and has held roles in counterterrorism and intelligence operations. Patel’s vision for reform includes shutting down the FBI’s J. Edgar Hoover Building, reopening it as a 'museum of the Deep State,' and dispersing agents nationwide to focus on criminal investigations. He has criticized the misuse of classification systems as a tool to conceal corruption. With his deep ties to Trump’s agenda and his track record in intelligence and law enforcement, Patel’s nomination is seen as a game-changer for the FBI’s future direction. document.createElement('video'); The post Trump taps Kash Patel as nominee for FBI director appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/trump-taps-kash-patel-as-nominee-for-fbi-director/	2024-12-01T03:47:15-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/shutterstock_2270821397-scaled.jpg
‘Without the civil squads I wouldn’t be here’: The fight to equip...	Friday’s event was complete with stands and booths giving away everything from tactical gear and vests to gifts, clothes, and school for the children of squad members, also came complete with food, live music, and speeches. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Understaffed, undersupplied, underfunded, and overworked, local Israeli civilian security teams were forced to battle heavily armed Hamas terrorists on October 7. Since then, they have been forced to do everything from providing security for their communities during an ongoing war to putting out forest fires sparked by daily Hezbollah missile barrages. In the face of these challenges, two Israeli nonprofits, Civil Squads of Israel and Israel Support Bridge, came together with around 1,500 members of the security teams and their families for an event on Friday morning, to provide some badly needed equipment, and express appreciation. 'For some, it’s one of the only times they’re able to get together and have a good time with their family in safety since October 7,' Alon Tirer, one of the founders of Civil Squads of Israel, told The Press Service of Israel. Before the October 7 attacks, members of kitot konenut — as they are known in Hebrew – were trained in basic military and first aid skills and equipped, in theory, to handle threats until security forces arrived. However, many civil defense squad members didn’t have enough helmets, vests, weapons, and more. Friday’s event was complete with stands and booths giving away everything from tactical gear and vests to gifts, clothes, and school for the children of squad members, also came complete with food, live music, and speeches. 'The [Israel Defense Forces] are here to protect us, but we must recognize that in the critical first minutes, the local defense force will often stand alone,' said former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett at the event. 'If four individuals managed to fend off dozens of terrorists, imagine what a platoon with machine guns, reserve training days, and a properly funded security coordinator could achieve – nothing could overcome them,' he added. For that reason, one of the main focuses of the event was enabling civil defense squad members to stock up on gear, Tirer explained. 'People can choose for themselves whatever equipment they like. It’s shopping for free,' he told TPS-IL. The two nonprofits have done significantly more than that over the past year. While Civil Squads of Israel is on the ground providing gear and training to the individual kitot konenut, Israel Support Bridge is known for its connections with donors, recipients and various government bodies. 'After October 7, I reached out to all the people I knew,' Ben Mammon, founder and CEO of Israel Support Bridge, told TPS-IL. Mammon quickly began talking to people on the ground, different organizations, and government ministries, organizing a database of Israel’s wartime needs and figuring out how to get it to the right people. One of those people was Nir Alon, founder and CEO of Civil Squads of Israel. Born and raised in Kibbutz Sufa in the Gaza border region, Alon survived October 7 in a shelter at the kibbutz, and attributes his survival to the sacrifice of his community’s security team. 'During the attack there were only four people in the civil squad in Sufa, only four rifles with no scopes,' Alon recalled. 'Without the civil squads I wouldn’t be here, so I took this very seriously and realized that something needs to be done,' Alon said. Since then, Civil Squads of Israel has launched trainings and supply drives across the country, training and equipping Israel’s frontline civilian responders in firefighting, first aid, and self-defense. But needing help, Alon turned to Israel Support Bridge and its supply chain. 'Before long I had a full 747 plane land in Israel under my name, and after that two planes every week,' Mammon explained. The partnership 'enables buying in bulk: medical equipment, vests, firefighting support, whatever people need. The mechanism was always the same, working together, accumulating the resources, and getting the project done. Ultimately, we’re two big nonprofits working together towards the same goal,' Tirer said. 'Its’ one of those cases where one plus one is ten.'

EU’s anti-Israel foreign minister steps down	Josep Borrell was a fierce critic whose last statements demanded that all EU states enforce ICC arrest warrants against Israeli leaders. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Josep Borrell, the EU’s ‘foreign minister,’ stepped down Saturday as his five-year term came to an end, causing most Israelis to breathe a sigh of relief. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy had been a fierce critic of the Jewish state, especially over its conduct of the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Some detractors call the Spanish politician 'obsessed' with Israel, rather than focusing on problems much closer to home. Ynet counted Borrell’s posts about the Palestinians and Israel and found that in the last nine months he had tweeted 127 times about it, twice as many as about the Ukraine-Russia war on the EU doorstep that has the real potential of spilling over into neighboring, member states. The posts are full of condemnations of Israeli 'massacres' and other unproven allegations, with barely a nod to the fact that Hamas sparked the ongoing war by brutally massacring 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians, and taking 251 hostage in a surprise invasion last October 7, with 101 still being held captive. He has also called for concrete action to be taken to put pressure on the Jewish state to end the war and the 'humanitarian crisis' in the enclave. At an EU foreign ministers’ meeting earlier this month, Borrell proposed the suspension of political dialogue with Israel and a ban on importing 'products from illegal settlements' due to its alleged human rights violations in the Gaza Strip, which Jerusalem strongly denies. It did not pass because such decisions must be unanimous, and several states did not support the motion, including Germany, Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic. As his final act, on Thursday Borrell said all EU member states must 'support fully the International [Criminal] Court' and not 'undermine' its arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant on war crimes charges relating the Israel-Hamas war. Several EU members have said they will not arrest the two if they visit, including Hungary and France. Borrell also castigated Israeli society, saying it was 'being colonized from the inside by extremism and violent people.' The outgoing foreign minister has been leading the effort to financially sanction Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria on the basis of unproven accusations of harming Palestinians in the region, following the lead of the Biden administration. Former prime minister of Estonia Kaja Kallas, who is considered much more amenable to Israel, will be the EU’s new foreign policy chief.

Israeli minister issues ultimatum on hostage deal, pushes for tra...	Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir says Netanyahu starting to warm up to idea of encouraging Arab emigration from Gaza, warns his party could bolt government if current Gaza ceasefire deal under consideration is accepted. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's National Security Minister warned that his party would not accept the outline for a ceasefire deal with Hamas currently under consideration, hinting that his faction would bolt Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government if it were to be accepted. Speaking with Army Radio on Sunday, Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) pushed back against a new proposal, presented by an Egyptian delegation, for a limited ceasefire and hostage deal. According to reports last week, the deal would include a two-month truce in the Gaza Strip, the release of some number - possibly several dozen - of the 101 captives still held in the Gaza Strip, and a parallel release of hundreds of jailed Palestinian Arab terrorists held by Israel. The plan marks a significant change from prior proposals, in that Israel would not be obliged to agree to a permanent end to the war, though the new outline would provide for talks during the two-month ceasefire for a long-term cessation of fighting in Gaza. Ben-Gvir, however, objected to the release of large numbers of jailed terrorists in exchange for only some of the remaining Israeli captives, saying the new proposal was 'irrelevant' as far as he is concerned, hinting Otzma Yehudit would bolt the government should the deal be accepted. 'I believe that a reckless deal that would release 1,000 prisoners from the Sinwar group is a severe blow to the State of Israel. Stop misleading the public; this is not even on the table as far as Hamas is concerned,' Ben-Gvir said. 'The deal currently being discussed does not bring back all the hostages. To retrieve all the hostages, the war must completely stop, and secondly, 1,000 prisoners from the Sinwar group would have to be released.' Ben-Gvir intimated that Prime Minister Netanyahu would not agree to the deal over Otzma Yehudit's opposition. 'I am not willing to accept the deal currently being proposed. The terms being discussed are irrelevant to me—and the Prime Minister does not want Otzma Yehudit to leave the government.' Netanyahu, Ben-Gvir continued, 'understands politics very well.' Late last month, Ben-Gvir cast the sole vote in Israel's security cabinet opposing the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. The ceasefire deal was passed by the security cabinet by a margin of 10-1, with the backing of Ben-Gvir's election ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party). In Sunday's interview, Ben-Gvir called for long-term Israeli control of the Gaza Strip, the restoration of Jewish settlement in the area, and a policy of encouraging voluntary Arab emigration or 'transfer' from the coastal enclave. 'Ideas like the resettlement of Gaza have my blessing. The only times we defeated our enemies were when we took land from them. But for me, that’s not enough—I also want to encourage migration, for them to voluntarily emigrate to their countries.' Ben-Gvir suggested that Prime Minister Netanyahu, who in the past has publicly opposed plans to transfer Gaza's population, is now starting to warm to the idea of encouraging voluntary mass emigration. 'And you know what? I’m working hard with the Prime Minister to advance the encouragement of migration from Gaza—and I’m starting to see a certain openness from him on this matter.' 'I’m saying that he is showing openness to something he previously opposed, and I think the time has come to do such a thing.'

IDF laying groundwork for long-term control of Gaza Strip – repor...	Two military bases and a north-south buffer strip have joined the Netzarim and Philadelphi roads over the last several months. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF zones that the army’s engineers have created within the Gaza Strip over the last year show that it’s serious about maintaining security control of the enemy territory for at least the medium-term, the Swiss Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) reported Friday. By examining satellite imagery, the daily drew a clear picture of the new roads and infrastructure Israel has built in order to help the army’s efforts against the Hamas terrorists, as well as ensure security for Israeli citizens after the war is over. Only a few weeks into the ground incursion into Gaza, which began in late October, 2023, troops started blowing up the buildings within a kilometer of the border to create a buffer zone for the kibbutzim and moshavim whose fields and home came within meters sometimes of the original fence. By now, reported NZZ, approximately 90% of a north-south, kilometer-wide strip has been razed to the ground. The Philadelphi Corridor on the Egyptian-Gazan border that had been the main smuggling route for Hamas weaponry, both over and under the ground, has been turned into a constantly patrolled, two-lane, paved road, enabling the IDF to shut down this 'oxygen pipeline,' as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dubbed it. The biggest project has been the Netzarim Corridor, which cuts completely through the Strip about a third of the way down from its northern tip, through the outer parts of Gaza City. The seven-kilometer-long road is wide, well-paved, and protected by earthen embankments in certain sections on either side. There are also watchtowers and at least two army bases dotting its flanks. Buildings have been steadily demolished all around the road to a form a secure zone five to six kilometers wide. The corridor started as the answer to a tactical need but is now 'a strategic element,' Mitvim think-tank president Nimrod Goren told the paper. 'It also serves to divide the territory, to control the movement of the Palestinian population, to enable ongoing action against Hamas infrastructure and to show that Israel will not be leaving any time soon.' This differs, for example, from several short access roads from Israeli territory, mostly to heavily populated areas like Gaza City, Khan Younis and Rafah, that have also been constructed. Security experts NZZ interviewed said these were likely only tactical in nature, to ease army operations, and would not be maintained long-term. Despite its importance to Israeli security, even the well-built southern road may not become a permanent fixture, according to Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies in King's College London. 'Given the international significance of the Philadelphia corridor – where the interests of Israel, Egypt and the U.S. converge – this issue is likely to be resolved through negotiations,' he told NZZ. The Biden administration has maintained that Israel cannot remain as an occupying power in Gaza after Hamas has been destroyed, and that no land could be subtracted from the Palestinians as a result of the war. Netanyahu has said Israel would not reoccupy Gaza, but that no matter who runs the coastal entity in the future – something far from being settled as yet – Israel would have to retain 'security responsibility' there so that the residents of the south can live there safely again. His national-religious coalition partners are of a different opinion, saying that Israel should resettle areas evacuated in the 2005 unilateral Disengagement, as they believe this is the only way to successfully maintain Israel’s security in the long term. On Thursday, Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party joined them, saying that 'Jewish settlement here is the answer to the terrible [Oct. 7] massacre and to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.' Some 53% of Jewish Israelis support the reestablishment of Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip, according to the 'Peace Index' survey released by Tel Aviv University in January.

Israelis in Thailand facing high threat of terror attacks	A number of Iranian plots to harm Israelis abroad have been thwarted in recent years by the Mossad and other Israeli intelligence agencies. By World Israel News Staff Israelis currently vacationing in Thailand were urged to remain vigilant, as the 'terrorist infrastructure' which orchestrated the murder of an Israeli rabbi in the United Arab Emirates are seeking to harm Israelis in the southeast Asian nation, according to Israel's National Security Council (NSC). 'Current intelligence indicates that the terrorists responsible for the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan in Dubai&#8230;have been planning further terrorist activity,' read a statement from the NSC. The NSC warning may refer to Iran, which has formally denied responsibility for Kogan's slaying, but is believed by some Israeli security officials to have organized the murder. A number of Iranian plots to harm Israelis abroad have been thwarted in recent years by the Mossad and other Israeli intelligence agencies. The warning that terrorist elements are actively plotting to attack Israelis in Thailand comes two weeks after the Mossad specifically warned Israeli tourists to avoid the famous Full Moon Party, due to the threat of attacks. Thailand is an extremely popular vacation destination for Israelis, with hundreds of thousands visiting the country annually. Some Thai islands, such as Ko Samui, have small Israeli expat communities. Israelis must 'avoid attending large-scale events associated with Israel, with an emphasis on those announced in advance, or places of entertainment and gathering associated with Israel. Notify local security forces if you are exposed to hostile activity targeting Israelis,' the NSC said. The NSC told Israelis to be 'extra alert in public places,' such as restaurants, hotels, and bars. The agency also advised Israelis to hide symbols of their Jewish and Israeli identities, as well as avoid mentioning their military service or posting details of their vacation - such as the names of their hotels - on public social media profiles.

Kidnappers murdered UAE rabbi after botched abduction – report	Uzbeki kidnappers had planned to smuggle Rabbi Zvi Kogan across the border into Oman but murdered him after their abduction plan went awry, according to Wall Street Journal report. By World Israel News Staff The suspects responsible for the abduction and murder of a rabbi in the United Arab Emirates had planned to transfer him across the border to Oman, but killed him after their plans went awry, according to a report published by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday. On the morning of November 21st, Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a dual Israeli-Moldovan citizen serving as aide to the chief rabbi of the United Arab Emirates and the proprietor of a kosher grocery shop in Abu Dhabi, was abducted and driven in his own car by his kidnappers towards the border with Oman. Days later, his remains were found in his car en route to the border, with clear signs he had been murdered. Relatives and friends who spoke with the Journal said Rabbi Kogan's death was 'a bloody end,' without offering details. According to Sunday's report, the three suspects linked to the killing had planned on smuggling the 28-year-old rabbi over the border - alive - to Oman, but were ultimately foiled. It remains unclear what prevented the three Uzbeki nationals linked to the case from crossing the border with Rabbi Kogan, leading to his murder. UAE security forces arrested the three suspects last week, just days after Rabbi Kogan was declared missing. The UAE's Ministry of the Interior identified the three suspects as Olembay Toyirovich, 28, Mahmoud Abd Rahim, 28, and Azizet Kamalovich, 33, and released a photograph of three in custody. Some Israeli officials cited by Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, have speculated that while the abduction and killing bear the hallmarks of a terrorist organization, the terror cell responsible may not be linked to Iran.

Former Israeli defense minister accuses Israel of ‘ethnically cle...	Moshe Ya'alon, a former member of the Likud who served as Defense Minister under Netanyahu after stint as IDF chief of staff, accuses Israeli government of promoting 'occupation, annexation, ethnic cleansing of Gaza.' By World Israel News Staff A former Israeli defense minister and ex-member of the ruling Likud party accused the Israeli government over the weekend of working towards the 'ethnic cleansing' of the Gaza Strip. Speaking with Democrat TV on Saturday, Moshe Ya'alon accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition government of planning to occupy, then annex, the Gaza Strip, restore Jewish settlement in the coastal enclave, and ethnically cleanse it of Palestinian Arabs. 'The path we are being dragged down is one of occupation, annexation and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip,' Ya'alon said. 'Transfer, call it what you want, and Jewish settlements.' Ya'alon claimed that a majority of Israelis reject proposals by members of the Israeli government to maintain long-term Israeli control over the Gaza Strip, to resettle the area, or to promote voluntary migration of Palestinian Arabs. 'Now look at the polls. Seventy percent — sometimes more and sometimes a little less — of the public in the State of Israel advocates a path that is Jewish, democratic, liberal etc., and also with separation.' 'Therefore, there must be no confusion here. The one who wants to confuse us is the one who is currently leading us to nothing less than destruction.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls by some of his ministers, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) to apply Israeli sovereignty over the Gaza Strip, to resettle the area, or to pursue the voluntary transfer of the Arab population. When the host, Arab-Israeli journalist Lucy Aharish, pushed back on Ya'alon's claims of ethnic cleansing, the former general doubled down on his accusation. 'What is happening there? What is happening there? There is no Beit Lahia, there is no Beit Hanoun, [the IDF] is currently operating in Jabalia and are essentially cleansing the area of ​​Arabs.' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar (New Hope), a long-time rival of Netanyahu who recently joined the government, castigated Ya'alon over his comments, tweeting: 'The irresponsible comments of former minister Moshe Ya’alon are incorrect and slander Israel without a basis. I call on him to retract his comments.' Ya'alon, 74, was a career officer in the IDF, serving in the military from 1968 until his retirement in 2005. He rose to the rank of lieutenant general and served as chief of staff from 2002 to 2005, when he resigned in protest over the Gaza Disengagement plan. Four years later, Ya'alon entered politics, running on the Likud ticket and serving as Strategic Affairs Minister and Defense Minister under Prime Minister Netanyahu from 2009-2013 and 2013-2016 respectively. After his tenure as defense chief, however, Ya'alon became a fierce critic of Netanyahu, leaving the Likud and forming the Telem party, which later ran on a joint ticket with Benny Gantz's Blue and White party. During 2023, Ya'alon frequently joined protests against the judicial reform plan, accusing the Israeli government of behaving like a 'dictatorship of criminals.'

Sirens activated in central Israel due to Yemen-launched missile	Sirens heard in central cities near airport, Jerusalem suburb for first time since Hezbollah ceasefire came into effect. By World Israel News Staff Air raid sirens warning of incoming missile fire sounded throughout central Israel on Sunday morning, breaking several days of relative quiet following the implementation of a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. According to an Israeli army statement, the sirens were activated by a ballistic missile launched from Yemen by Houthi terrorists, who are backed by Iran. The IDF said that the missile had been successfully intercepted outside of Israel's borders, but the alarms sounded due to concerns of falling shrapnel. Sirens sounded in major cities including the central cities of Modi'in, Lod, which is near Ben Gurion Airport, and Beit Shemesh, a Jerusalem suburb. Hebrew-language news outlet Mako reported that Magen David Adom paramedics were treating several people who had been hurt while running to bomb shelters, as well as a number of individuals who were suffering from acute anxiety. Last week, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi said the Hezbollah ceasefire should inspire other Shia terror groups in the region to attack Israel. 'It is important to build on what was achieved on the Lebanese front and move toward further escalation [against Israel], particularly from Iraq and Yemen,' al-Houthi said. Since the outbreak of the October 7th war, the Houthis fired more than 200 explosive drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles at Israel. The group has often exaggerated the results of these launches, including falsely claiming to hit sensitive sites such as the Nevatim Air Base in southern Israel. In June, one Houthi-launched drone managed to reach Tel Aviv and crashed some 200 meters away from the American consulate, killing an Israeli man. 'The Yemeni Armed Forces will carry out more military operations against the Israeli enemy in triumph for the blood of our people in Palestine and Lebanon, and will not stop supportive military operations during the coming days until the Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon stops,' Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said in a statement following a missile in launch in September, which was intercepted and caused no injuries or damage.

Iran leveraging ceasefire to rebuild Hezbollah – report	After the terror group's heavy losses in the recent conflict, it is more dependent than ever on Iranian support to survive. By World Israel News Staff Iran is using the current ceasefire as an opportunity to rebuild and rearm Hezbollah, its largest proxy group on Israel's northern border, as well as activate other Shia militias in the region to attack Israel. Despite bombastic statements from Hezbollah declaring victory over Israel, Iran views the terror group has having lost to Israel, as over 4,000 of its members were killed and thousands more were wounded. While some have suggested that Iran may cut its losses and focus on its other proxy groups - such as the Houthis in Yemen and various Shia militias in Iraq and Syria - one Iran expert noted the long-term investment that Tehran has made in Hezbollah. 'The Iranian relationship with Hezbollah doesn’t end with this defeat to Israeli forces,' Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at London’s Chatham House think tank, told the Post. 'This is a relationship that was nurtured and cultivated over decades. The relationship will certainly live on.' Within Hezbollah, there is some lingering anger over Iran's lack of direct intervention to spare the terror group from heavy losses during the conflict with Israel. Though Iran flew Hezbollah terrorists for treatment in Iranian hospitals after the beeper explosions, Iran did not directly attack Israel in order to save the terror group. Many in Lebanon have expressed anger over Hezbollah for bringing Iranian influence into the country and its parliament, in which Hezbollah's political branch has representatives. Hezbollah loyalists have argued that the terror group is a Lebanese-born 'liberation group,' aiming to protect Lebanon from Israeli aggression. But after the terror group's heavy losses in the recent conflict, it is more dependent than ever on Iranian support to rebuild. 'Iran is prepared to allocate funds for reconstruction and to ensure Hezbollah’s survival, as well as to maintain support within the Shiite community,' a person with inside knowledge of Hezbollah's internal politics told the Washington Post. 'However, this support is now more directly under Iranian influence,' he added, explaining that Hezbollah believes Iran will send field agents to ensure that the funding is being used properly, as well as to provide military training to surviving members of the terror group.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Mandy Damari, mother of British-Israeli citizen Emily Damari, described the UN's proposed ceasefire as a 'death sentence' for the hostages still in Gaza. Speaking at a rally on Saturday night at the Sha'ar Hanegev Junction, Damari described traveling to Geneva and meeting with United Nations, Red Cross, and Human Rights Council officials. She recounted being at the UN on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, 'a day dedicated to standing against injustice. Yet, if there's any place where injustice is overlooked, and falsehoods thrive, it's here.' Damari said, 'The UN recently attempted to pass a ceasefire resolution that did not include a demand for the release of the hostages. If not for the US veto, that resolution would have passed—and it would have effectively been a death sentence for our loved ones. Hamas would have had no incentive to release them.' She continued, 'We told the UN what they didn't want to hear: they're failing. The Red Cross has failed. Not one hostage has received humanitarian aid, not one has been visited, and not one family has gotten any sign of life. If these organizations had done their jobs, our loved ones would be home by now. Instead, we're met with excuses, false support, and empty promises.' Damari said she was flying to the UK and would ask government officials why they supported the UN resolution. Currently, Emily Damari is the only British citizen left of the 101 hostages remaining in Gaza. Speaking of the British government, Damari said, 'They told me three weeks ago they would fight for her. So where is that fight now? Were they actually speaking the truth when they told me they are fighting for her to return home?'

High-ranking UAE official attends Rabbi Zvi Kogan’s shiva	During the shiva call, Nuaimi stressed that his country will continue to seek coexistence and will not let extremists threaten this goal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, a senior representative of the United Arab Emirates, arrived in Jerusalem on Friday to pay his respects to terror victim rabbi Zvi Kogan, Israel Hayom reports. Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi visited the Kogan family sitting shiva, a seven-day Jewish mourning observance. During the shiva call, Nuaimi stressed that his country will continue to seek coexistence and will not let extremists threaten this goal. 'The state and its citizens are more committed than ever to the values of openness and peace and will increase their efforts to ensure that Rabbi Zvi's legacy continues and that all communities live in harmony in the UAE,' the senior official said. Former Israeli Ambassador to the UAE, Amir Hayek, joined Nuaimi's visit to the Kogan family home. On Sunday, following the discovery of Rabbi Kogan's body, Emirati Ambassador to the United States Yousef Al-Otaiba said in a statement, 'Our thoughts are with his family, friends, and community over his senseless death. Zvi Kogan's murder was more than a crime in the UAE – it was a crime against the UAE. It was an attack on our homeland, on our values, and on our vision.' 'In the UAE, we welcome everyone. We embrace peaceful coexistence. We reject extremism and fanaticism of every kind. We honor Zvi Kogan's memory by recommitting ourselves to these values.' 'Now, we are more determined than ever to protecting and sustaining the Emirates as a shining and enduring example of diversity, acceptance and peace.' Last Thursday, 28-year-old Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan, who served as an aide to the chief rabbi of the UAE and operated a kosher grocery shop in Abu Dhabi, was declared missing. Over the weekend, his body was found by UAE security personnel in a suspected terror attack.

IDF announces new ultra-orthodox brigade to launch during Chanuka...	The goal is to grow the Hashmonaim Brigade's number of combat soldiers to a unit of 60 to 80 with ultra-orthodox reserve soldiers engaged in extended training. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF announced the launch of an entirely ultra-orthodox combat unit called the Hashmonaim Brigade on Chanukah, Ynet reports. The release on Chanukah is appropriate, given that the Hasmonaim historically was the dynasty that led the Maccabean revolt against the Syrian-Greeks, commemorated during the Chanukah holiday. The brigade includes 30 pre-screened recruits, with dozens of others expressing interest in joining. The goal is to grow the Hashmonaim Brigade's number of combat soldiers to a unit of 60 to 80 with ultra-orthodox reserve soldiers engaged in extended training. The Hashmoniam focuses on voluntary recruitment of ultra-orthodox soldiers following a dialogue with heads of yeshivas and community rabbis rather than through compulsory enlistment, as occurred with the 7,000 recently issued draft orders in the ultra-orthodox community. The focus is on fostering trust between the ultra-orthodox community and Israel's military with a commitment to assisting and requiring the religious troops to adhere to their strict religious observance. The soldiers are expected to practice modest speech, use only filtered cell phones, and wear their traditional ultra-orthodox attire at prayer and meals. Any violation of these rules will result in dismissal from regular army service. All training will occur within the Hashmonaim Brigade to avoid intermingling with other units and a relaxation of standards. Col. Avinoam Emunah, commander of the Hashmonaim Brigade, told Ynet, 'I have the privilege of commanding the ultra-Orthodox brigade and being part of this extraordinary project that has the potential to bring meaningful change to Israeli society and the Jewish people as a whole.' 'For the first time since the founding of the IDF and the establishment of the state, we've created a brigade that allows the ultra-Orthodox community to enlist, fight and serve while preserving their way of life and their identity. I invite you—those who feel the calling to defend their land, their people and their country—to join us and take part in something historic, something unprecedented. Be part of the beginning of this blessing,' he added.

IDF strikes Syria and Lebanon citing ceasefire violations	The IDF vowed to deal swiftly with any violations of the ceasefire agreement, including the transfer of weapons. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Saturday, the IAF struck targets in Syria and Lebanon, citing violations of the days-old ceasefire agreement. The strike in Syria took place close to the border in Lebanon, which Israel said Hezbollah was using to transfer weapons. In a statement, Israel's military said, 'The action was taken after identifying the transfer of weapons from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon, which continued even after the ceasefire agreement. This transfer represents a threat to the State of Israel and violates the terms of the ceasefire.' Syrian media said the strikes occurred close to the al-Qusayr area, although Israeli sources didn't specify what kind of facilities were hit. The IDF vowed to deal swiftly with any violations of the ceasefire agreement, including the transfer of weapons. 'The IDF will continue to act to remove any threat to the State of Israel that violates the terms of the ceasefire agreement,' the military added. The strikes come as instability erupts in Syria with insurgents breaching Aleppo. Israel's military also struck at observed ceasefire violators in Lebanon as they noticed Hezbollah terrorists loading a car with RPG, ammunition boxes, and other military equipment. The IDF also noticed Hezbollah terrorists in a building that the terrorist group previously used. Also on Saturday, the IAF struck at a facility near Sidon, which Hezbollah used to store rocket launchers. The IDF carried out a drone strike 'deep within Lebanon' against a vehicle at a facility Hezbollah used to manufacture missiles. Israel's military in Lebanon also discovered a cache of weapons stored at a mosque. They also dismissed Hezbollah terrorists spotted in the no-go area in Southern Lebanon. Lebanese media also accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire agreement and claimed an Israeli drone attacked a car in the southern village of Majdal Zoun, wounding three people.

Prison escapee convicted of passing UK military secrets to Iran	While Khalife claimed most information he shared was fabricated or publicly available, prosecutors used evidence from his phones, notes, and surveillance footage to prove he had gathered and shared real classified information. By Jewish Breaking News A former British soldier who made headlines with a daring escape from a London prison was convicted Thursday of spying for Iran. Daniel Khalife, 23, was found guilty by a jury in Woolwich Crown Court of violating Britain’s Official Secrets Act and Terrorism Act. The 23-year-old joined the Army at 16, serving in the Royal Corps of Signals, a communications unit working with battlefield troops and special forces. He received NATO secret security clearance during a joint exercise at Fort Cavazos in Texas in early 2021, during which time he shared intelligence information with his Iranian handlers. British security only learned of his Iranian contacts after he approached MI6, anonymously offering to work as a double agent. He claimed he had earned his handlers’ trust and received $2,000 in a dog poo bag in a north London park. While Khalife claimed most information he shared was fabricated or publicly available, prosecutors used evidence from his phones, notes, and surveillance footage to prove he had gathered and shared real classified information. They also showed he traveled to Turkey to meet a contact. In his testimony, Khalife said he had contacted people in the Iranian government after he got the idea from watching 'Homeland,' a Showtime television drama about CIA operations and espionage. His defense lawyer, Gul Nawaz Hussein, characterized Khalife’s James Bond aspirations as naive and stupid, bordering on slapstick. He said his client was more 'Scooby Doo' than '007.' Despite the seemingly amateur nature of his actions, Counter Terrorism Commander Dominic Murphy of the Metropolitan Police stressed Khalife’s dangerousness. 'We know very well the threat that Iranians pose to the U.K.’s national security,' Murphy said. 'He’s the ultimate Walter Mitty character who was having a significant impact in the real world.' The case gained widespread attention after Khalife’s September 2023 prison break, when he escaped from Wandsworth Prison by strapping himself under a delivery truck. After a massive three-day search, authorities caught him on a canal path. His escape exposed broader issues in Britain’s aging, overcrowded prison system, prompting an ongoing inquiry into how he managed to escape and whether he had help. Though Khalife owned up to his prison break during the proceedings, his denials of espionage fell flat with the jury. 'He surreptitiously sought out and obtained copies of secret and sensitive information which he knew were protected and passed these on to individuals he believed to be acting on behalf of the Iranian state,' said Bethan David of the Crown Prosecution Service. 'The sharing of the information could have exposed military personnel to serious harm, or a risk to life, and prejudiced the safety and security of the United Kingdom.'

Maccabi Tel Aviv plays soccer game in empty Hungarian stadium ami...	The match on Thursday was Maccabi Tel Aviv’s first game in Europe since its fans were violently attacked in The Netherlands during the late hours of Nov. 7 and into the early hours of the following morning. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel Aviv played a UEFA Europa League match on Thursday against their Turkish rivals Besiktas in an empty stadium in Hungary, which was closed to supporters likely due to security concerns following the recent attack on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam. Maccabi won the match 3-1 in the Nagyerdei Stadium in Debrecen, Hungary, during the fifth week of the UEFA Europa League. Gavriel Kanichowsky secured Israel’s lead in the 23rd minute with a goal, but Besiktas struck back in the 38th minute with a goal by Rafa Silva to tie the score. Maccabi Tel Aviv took the lead again right before halftime by scoring another goal in added time. The Israeli club finished 3-1 with Weslley Patati’s goal in the 81st minute. Groups of police patrolled outside the venue and the game concluded with no incident, according to the Associated Press. On Nov. 11, days after the attack against Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam, the European soccer body UEFA announced that this week’s match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Besiktas, which was originally scheduled to take place in Istanbul, would be moved to Hungary 'following a decision by the Turkish authorities not to stage it in Turkey.' Hungary, which has hosted several home games for Israel’s national soccer team since the start of the Israel-Hamas war last year, agreed to host the match and UEFA said it 'will be played behind closed doors following a decision of the local Hungarian authorities.' Maccabi Tel Aviv coach Zarko Lazetic said after Thursday’s match that playing in front of an empty stadium was hard for the team. 'We play football because of the fans, to give them some pleasure, some excite(ment) and to be together,' he explained, as reported by the AP. The match on Thursday was Maccabi Tel Aviv’s first game in Europe since its fans were violently attacked in The Netherlands during the late hours of Nov. 7 and into the early hours of the following morning. After the team competed against the Dutch club Ajax in a UEFA Europa League game in Amsterdam, anti-Israel gangs chased Israeli fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv through the streets of Amsterdam, ran them over with cars, physically assaulted them, and taunted Israeli soccer fans with anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian slogans such as 'Free Palestine.' Five people were reportedly hospitalized for injuries. Leaders in Israel and Europe condemned the premeditated and coordinated attack as antisemitic. Amsterdam’s mayor called the attackers 'antisemitic hit-and-run squads' and said the assailants were going 'Jew hunting.' Police in Amsterdam said they have already identified, investigated, and even arrested 45 suspects in connection to the incident. Following his team’s loss on Thursday to Maccabi Tel Aviv, Besiktas President Hasan Arat resigned from the soccer club, citing 'personal reasons.' He was elected president in December 2023. Earlier this week, former Premier League goalkeeper Brad Friedel was fired as sporting director of the Turkish team after having the job for only five months.

UK, France, Germany vow to continue nuke talks with Iran	According to a November report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Tehran had 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since its last report in August. By Amelie Botbol, JNS Britain, France and Germany have agreed to continue nuclear negotiations with Tehran following a meeting on Friday in Geneva and amid threats by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to reinstitute a 'maximum pressure' campaign on the Islamic Republic once he assumes office in January. Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister and senior nuclear negotiator Majid Takht-Ravanchi met with top diplomats from the European nations, known collectively as the E3. The talks came after the European countries joined the United States to have Iran censured by the U.N. atomic watchdog for its lack of cooperation. The resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency’s 35-nation Board of Governors notes an 'essential and urgent' need for Iran to provide 'technically credible explanations' for the uranium traces at undeclared facilities. It also urges the IAEA to compile 'a comprehensive and updated assessment on the possible presence or use of undeclared nuclear material in connection with past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran’s nuclear program.' According to a November report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Tehran had 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since its last report in August. This level of enrichment is a technical step short of 90% enrichment, considered weapons grade. Iran condemned the censure as 'politically motivated' and announced the launch of 'new advanced centrifuges' to produce additional enriched uranium. Last week, Britain’s foreign intelligence chief said that Tehran’s nuclear ambitions posed a major global threat. 'Iran’s allied militias across the Middle East have suffered serious blows,' said Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) chief Sir Richard Moore, adding, 'But the regime’s nuclear ambitions continue to threaten all of us.' Similarly, the head of France’s DGSI intelligence service warned of the risk of Iran’s nuclear breakout, noting that Paris and London were preparing for such an eventuality. 'Our services are working side by side to face what is undoubtedly one of the threats, if not to say the most critical threat, in the coming months—the possible atomic proliferation in Iran,' Nicolas Lerner said. 'The intelligence will be crucial to enable our authorities to make the right decisions and define the right strategies.' In an interview with The Guardian newspaper published on Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that his country was considering altering its nuclear policy. The threat came after an adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said earlier this month that Tehran has the capacity to develop nuclear weapons, should it choose to do so. 'We now have the technical capabilities necessary to produce nuclear weapons,' Kamal Kharrazi told the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen outlet. In May, Kharrazi told the ISNA news agency: 'If the Zionist regime dares to damage Iran’s nuclear facilities, our level of deterrence will be different. We have no decision to produce a nuclear bomb, but if the existence of Iran is threatened, we will have to change our nuclear doctrine.' In August, Iran International reported that the Islamic Republic was advancing its secret nuclear program, bringing the mullahs closer to building atomic bombs. Three independent sources in Iran told the London-based opposition media outlet that the regime was moving forward with its nuclear weapons program 'by restructuring the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), retaining Mohammad Eslami as the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and resuming tests to produce nuclear bomb detonators.' The Biden administration privately warned Tehran in June about its research and development activities, Axios reported on July 17, citing three Israeli and U.S. officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Jerusalem would do 'everything' to stop Tehran from acquiring the bomb. 'I will do everything to prevent it from becoming a nuclear [power], I will use all the resources that can be used,' the premier said. Earlier this month, Netanyahu told a Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee meeting that Israel would review its ability to act against Iran once the Trump administration takes over. During his first term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Obama-era accord more commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, which he said did not sufficiently prevent a pathway to an Iranian bomb. In October, Israeli airstrikes on Iran destroyed a secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin, 19 miles southeast of Tehran, according to Axios. The clandestine site held sophisticated equipment used for testing explosives needed to detonate nuclear devices.

Netanyahu, Gallant should turn themselves in, ICC spokesman tells...	This week, Netanyahu decided to appeal to the ICC against the decision to issue the arrest warrants. By Amichai Stein, JNS 'The suspects can decide to appear on a voluntary basis and surrender to the ICC. They have all the rights of the defense that are guaranteed, including the presumption of innocence.' That’s what Fadi El Abdallah, the spokesperson and head of the Public Affairs Unit at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, told JNS when asked what is expected now from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, now that the ICC has issued warrants for their arrest on charges of genocide. 'There is an arrest warrant that has been issued for the individuals, and it is the legal obligation of the states that are parties to the Rome Statute to cooperate with us,' El Abdallah continued. (Israel is not a party to the treaty that established the court—A.S.) But how is it possible, JNS asked, that only Israeli leaders are standing trial in connection to the Gaza war (an arrest warrant was also issued for Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, but he is dead). ICC Spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah. Credit: Academy for Cultural Diplomacy/Facebook. 'The ICC is checking if during a war crimes have been committed, and who is responsible. Even in wars there are rules that need to be applied to everyone,' El Abdallah said. 'The judges simply decided based of the evidence and based on the rules.' Will U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to sanction all those involved in the arrest warrants affect the court’s decision, JNS asks. 'The ICC has a legal mandate and we have to fulfill it. There are 124 states that gave the ICC a specific mandate to serve justice and to serve victims, and we have to fulfill our duty. We cannot take any political matters into consideration. We can only look at things with total independence and impartiality,' the spokesman responded. But still, JNS asked, you see countries such as France and Germany saying they won’t arrest Netanyahu and Gallant. You cannot say this doesn’t damage the court credibility or authority. 'As I said,' El Abdallah replied, 'no political matters can be taken into consideration. The judges are independent and impartial and will only decide based on the applicable legal rules and the evidence that are before them.' If there are requests of the ICC in relation to the implementation of its decision, they have to be raised with the judges, who will then decide on them, the Lebanese spokesperson added. A state commission of inquiry? Some in Israel claim that if only there were a state commission of inquiry into the events of Oct. 7, 2023, and its aftermath headed by the president of the Supreme Court, the arrest warrants would not have been issued. 'The arrest warrants have been issued,' the ICC spokesperson said. 'They cannot be withdrawn unless by the judges themselves based on a strong legal argumentation. If there is a request to the ICC judges, then they will have to check if all the conditions are met. But the general rules are that there is a need to establish that there are indeed genuine investigations for the same individuals and for the same alleged actions as indicated by the [ICC] decision.' Israel is not one of the 124 countries that signed the Rome Statute. This simple fact raised many eyebrows: How can the court put on trial the leaders of a country that is not within its jurisdiction? 'The ICC does not prosecute states, but it persecutes individuals for alleged criminal responsibility,' El Abdallah told JNS. 'The ICC jurisdiction covers the Palestinian territories, so Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and that means that when the state of Palestine ratified the Rome Statute [in 2015], if crimes are committed by anyone on the territory of Palestine, they can be prosecuted.' JNS then asked: You understand that the Israeli public sees the arrest warrant decision as antisemitic and anti-Israel, especially as it’s based on the decision, which was widely criticized, of the Palestinian Authority joining the court. The prestige of the judicial system? MK Simcha Rothman, who chairs the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, told JNS, 'I think it is very, very clear that it would not have mattered whether Israel had established a state commission of inquiry or whether it would have established a civil committee. 'Essentially what the spokesperson is claiming is that an investigation on the suspicious of genocide or crimes against humanity should have been opened [by Israel] against Gallant and Netanyahu—which of course no country would do. And of course, this shows that the claims of supporters of the [Israeli] judicial system, that the prestige of the judicial system could save us from the ICC, are untrue,' Rothman said. This week, Netanyahu decided to appeal to the ICC against the decision to issue the arrest warrants. 'I think there is no need to appeal. The very act of appealing to the ICC judges gives it treatment it does not deserve,' Rothman told JNS. 'This is an illegitimate body, and it should be treated as such. And we should act diplomatically with countries and use this incident as an opportunity to take steps against both the court and the perpetrator of the trial in the court, which is the Palestinian Authority.' Rothman said this is a golden opportunity to weaken the ICC. 'By imposing sanctions and delegitimizing the court, it will cause more countries to leave the court. Many people understand that this step will be used against them as well, so it should be used to harm the court,' he said. Amichai Stein is the diplomatic correspondent for Kan 11, IPBC.

Hamas may give up on crucial demands for hostage release – NYT	According to reports, Hamas might allow the IDF to occupy the Philadelphi corridor temporarily, something that was a key demand of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but Hamas considered a non-starter. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The New York Times on Thursday reported that Hamas may be willing to drop crucial demands for a hostage-ceasefire agreement. According to the Times, Palestinian and US leadership said they believed that Hamas might allow the IDF to occupy the Philadelphi corridor temporarily, something that was a key demand of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but was considered by Hamas to be a non-starter. In the last few months, Hamas has rejected any hostage release proposal that doesn't include Israel agreeing to an immediate and permanent withdrawal of military forces from Gaza. Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that the group 'appreciates' Lebanon's right to reach an agreement that protects its people and expressed hope for a deal that would end the war in Gaza. 'Hamas appreciates the right of Lebanon and Hezbollah to reach an agreement that protects the people of Lebanon, and we hope that this agreement will pave the way to reaching an agreement that ends the war of genocide against our people in Gaza,' Abu Zuhri stated. Following the implementation of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, US special envoy Amos Hochstein said, 'The Lebanese deal here opens an opportunity on the hostage deal,' he said. 'They [Hamas] wake up this morning at 4 am with Hezbollah, that used to be actively supportive of Hamas in the northern front, cutting a deal and ending that conflict.' In addition to the ceasefire in Lebanon, the death of Sinwar and uncertainty over the future of Hamas's leadership have created a widespread perception that Hamas may be more amenable to a hostage and ceasefire deal. The Times also cited the role of Iran and indicated that since much of the Islamic Republic's air defense systems were damaged by Israeli airstrikes, they may be unwilling to confront Israel. The victory of President-elect Donald Trump was cited as another factor in Iran's reluctance to attack Israel, and it may be more likely to rein in its proxies, such as Hezbollah and Hamas. There are also reports that after a year of war, Hamas has lost its grip on Gaza and that increasing numbers of Gazan civilians are turning on the terror group.

Two terrorists were involved in the shooting at Giti Avisar junction, one of whom was shot dead by security forces and the other is currently being pursued. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A terrorist who opened fire at an Israeli bus stop on Friday near the settlement of Ariel was eliminated by Israeli security forces. Two terrorists were involved in the shooting at Giti Avisar junction, one of whom was shot dead by security forces and the other is currently being pursued. The two terrorists were armed with assault rifles and began shooting suddenly at civilians. Magen Dovid Adom reported that of the eight wounded, four were hit with gunfire, including three in serious condition and one in moderate condition. The remaining people were injured through impact with broken glass. Magen David Adom paramedic Itamar Hakhamov described the scene: 'We arrived in large numbers and found casualties near the bus, fully conscious and suffering from gunshot wounds.' 'We quickly administered initial medical care and transported them to the hospital in stable condition. Other MDA teams treated individuals with shrapnel injuries from broken glass and also evacuated them with minor injuries,' he continued. This is a developing story.

Thousands attend pro-Israel rally in Amsterdam	Naomi Mestrum, the director of the Center for Information and Documentation Israel, a Dutch-Jewish group, thanked Christians for Israel for standing up for Jews and called on others to follow suit. By Canaan Lindor, JNS Thousands of people protested against antisemitism and in support of Jews and Israel on Thursday, at gathering in Amsterdam organized by Christian Zionists and Jewish groups. Police removed several anti-Israel protesters who showed up to confront the crowd at the so-called Stopera complex near the city’s Waterloo Square. The event was headlined 'Together against Jew-Hatred.' The Israel supporters waved Israeli and Dutch flags at the demonstration co-organized by Christians for Israel. Frank van Oordt, the NGO’s director, was one of the speakers who referenced the series of assaults by dozens of Muslims on Israelis returning from a soccer match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax in Amsterdam on Nov. 7. 'We see attempts to blame the Jews for violence against them and we are sick of it,' said van Oordt, whose father, Karel, founded Christians for Israel in 1979. 'We are standing by our Jews now, we do so proudly and we will not stand by as hatred is incited again against them.' Several of the attendees blew a shofar as others applauded van Oordt. Naomi Mestrum, the director of the Center for Information and Documentation Israel, a Dutch-Jewish group, thanked Christians for Israel for standing up for Jews and called on others to follow suit. 'Everyone should be standing by the Jewish people now,' she said. 'We are done talking. The authorities need to show up.' Esther Voet, the editor-in-chief of the Dutch-Jewish weekly NIW, noted that organizers reminded the demonstrators not to display the Israeli flag while leaving the demonstration for fear of attacks. Several speakers criticized Mayor Femke Halsema for revoking the permit the city gave the event’s organizers to hold the protest at Dam Square, a central point where many of the Nov. 7 assaults happened, and have it moved to the less central Stopera area. Halsema, a former leader of the far-left GroenLinks ('GreenLeft') party, cited public order concerns. Last week, Halsema retracted her initial use of the word 'pogrom' to describe the Nov. 7 assaults, where the perpetrators’ violence, use of the term 'Jew hunt' to describe their actions, and level of coordination shocked many witnesses. In recent weeks, politicians on the Dutch left repeated a narrative in which the Israelis instigated or provoked the violence. The victims and many witnesses dispute these allegations.

Israel extends waiver allowing Palestinian banking ties	Israel’s National Security Council said that severing banking ties with the PA would have 'significant negative consequences' for Israel’s security and foreign relations. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Security Cabinet on Thursday night extended a waiver allowing Israeli banks to cooperate with Palestinian ones for another year. The waiver allows Israeli banks to process shekel payments for services and salaries associated with the Palestinian Authority without running afoul of laws against terror-funding and money laundering. Palestinian banks process PA stipends for imprisoned terrorists and their families. Israel came under heavy US and European pressure as diplomats argued that without the waiver, the Palestinian Authority economy would collapse. An opinion presented by Israel’s National Security Council said that severing banking ties with the PA would have 'significant negative consequences' for Israel’s security and foreign relations, warning such a move would increase Palestinian terror financing and money laundering. The new waiver expires at the end of November 2025. The Palestinian Authority allocates seven percent of its annual budget for its so-called 'Martyr’s Fund,' which provides the stipends. The size of the monthly payouts is primarily determined by the duration of the terrorist’s incarceration, with a negligible additional factor based on family size. Ramallah has been paying out stipends for years, but the issue came under a spotlight following the murder of Taylor Force, a U.S. citizen killed by a Palestinian who went on a stabbing rampage in Jaffa in 2018. Congress passed the Taylor Force Act, which halted U.S. aid to the Palestinians as long as terror stipends are being paid out. U.S. assistance to the Palestinian Authority resumed under the administration of President Joe Biden. In December 2022, American victims of Palestinian terror filed a lawsuit against the President and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, arguing that the payments violate the Taylor Force Act. Despite claiming to be operating at a 172% budget deficit, the Palestinian Authority in July recognized 899 new prisoners from Gaza and tens of thousands more Gaza 'martyrs' as eligible for the 'pay for slay' payouts.

Trump team claims credit for Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire	The Biden administration had reportedly been in collaboration with the Trump team as the president-elect continues the transition process to the White House. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner Key members of the incoming Trump administration are taking credit for the newly announced ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, arguing that the Jewish state and the Lebanese terrorist group agreed to the deal in response to US-President-elect Donald Trump’s election victory earlier this month. 'Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump,' US Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL), Trump’s incoming White House national security adviser, said on X/Twitter. 'His resounding victory sent a clear message to the rest of the world that chaos won’t be tolerated. I’m glad to see concrete steps towards deescalation in the Middle East.' While celebrating the ceasefire, Waltz also warned that Iran, which backs Hezbollah, remains the main obstacle in securing long-standing peace in the Middle East. 'But let’s be clear: The Iran Regime is the root cause of the chaos & terror that has been unleashed across the region. We will not tolerate the status quo of their support for terrorism,' Waltz added. Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal on Tuesday that took effect on Wednesday, effectively ending a 14-month period of war between the two parties. The agreement, brokered by the US and France, will allow roughly 70,000 Israelis to return to their homes in the northern portion of the Jewish state after having been displaced by barrages of missiles, rockets, and drones from Hezbollah. Estimates suggest that Hezbollah fired between 100-200 missiles into northern Israel nearly every day since the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel last Oct. 7. The ceasefire agreement will allow for intensified diplomatic efforts in Gaza, where Israel has been embroiled in an ongoing war with Hamas since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks. Addressing the press from the White House Rose Garden, Biden touted the new pact between Israel and Hezbollah. However, the president cautioned that Israel retains the right to retaliate should the terrorist group launch another attack against the Jewish state. 'Let’s be clear. Israel did not launch this war. The Lebanese people did not seek that war either. Nor did the United States,' Biden said. 'This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,' Biden added. 'What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed to threaten the security of Israel again.' The Biden administration had reportedly been in collaboration with the Trump team as the president-elect continues the transition process to the White House. Waltz and Jake Sullivan, the outgoing national security adviser, had reportedly been in communication regarding the White House’s efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. However, the Biden administration has said that none of Trump;s senior foreign policy team directly participated in the ceasefire negotiations. US Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) also credited Trump for the truce. 'I appreciate the hard work of the Biden administration, supported by President Trump, to make this ceasefire a reality,' Graham wrote on social media. Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank, posted on social media that 'Iran is pulling back to regroup ahead of Trump coming into office.' 'It’s a combination of Israeli military success and Trump’s election — the ayatollah has no clothes and he knows we know,' Goldberg said.

Gaza resettlement the answer to Oct. 7 massacre, ICC case, Israel...	Some 53% of Jewish Israelis support the reestablishment of Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip, according to the 'Peace Index' survey. By JNS Resettling the Israeli towns that were destroyed as part of the 2005 disengagement from Gaza is the answer to the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas massacre and the ICC case against the Jewish state’s leaders, Israeli Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf said on Thursday. Writing on X after a visit to the Gaza border with Zionist activist Daniella Weiss, Goldknopf—the head of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism Party—said that 'Jewish settlement here is the answer to the terrible [Oct. 7] massacre and to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.' The haredi leader noted that the ICC, 'instead of caring for the 101 captives [still held by Hamas after 419 days], chose to issue arrest warrants against the prime minister and the [former] defense minister.' In the post, Goldknopf shared a picture of himself and Weiss with a map of prospective Jewish communities to be established in the Gaza Strip. סיירתי היום בישובי חבל עזה. ההתיישבות היהודית כאן היא התשובה לטבח הנורא והתשובה לביה״ד הבינלאומי בהאג שבמקום לדאוג ל-101 החטופים בחר להוציא צווים נגד ראש הממשלה ושר הבטחון. pic.twitter.com/01GGVwcS1d &mdash; השר יצחק גולדקנופף (@DOVRUTGoldknopf) November 28, 2024 On Nov. 13, Weiss entered the enclave to scout potential locations for Jewish communities on behalf of her Nahala Movement, which works to establish new communities throughout the Land of Israel. Weiss, known for her leadership in the Gush Emunim movement, has been actively promoting a plan for resettling the Strip. Her organization has prepared six settlement nuclei involving hundreds of families. She told Kan News last week, 'We are no longer waiting for authorization. The moment entry is possible, we enter. We don’t wait for water supply infrastructure, generators or any other preparations. If 300 people enter at once, evacuating them would require 1,000 soldiers.' In August, Israeli security forces arrested six youths after dozens tried to breach the border to conduct a Jewish morning prayer service in Gaza. The attempt to enter the enclave came as resettlement activists marked 19 years since the military carried out the disengagement from Gaza, in which more than 8,000 Jews were forcibly removed from their homes in the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria. In August 2005, the Israeli government headed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon unilaterally disengaged from Gaza, removing thousands from their homes and transferring them to within the Green Line. While the move was designed to bring calm to Israel’s southern border, it ushered in a victory for Hamas in January 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council elections. In June 2006, the terrorist organization seized power in the Strip and evicted the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. During its Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of the northwestern Negev, Hamas murdered some 1,200 people and wounded thousands more. It also took around 250 civilians and soldiers back to Gaza as hostages. Some 53% of Jewish Israelis support the reestablishment of Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip, according to the 'Peace Index' survey released by Tel Aviv University in January of this year. Five months ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out the possibility of civilians returning to the enclave. 'If you mean resettling Gaza, … it was never in the cards, and I said so openly. And some of my constituents are not happy about it, but that’s my position,' the Israeli leader said in a May 21 interview with CNN.

Former hostage Mia Schem is engaged one year after her release	Mia Schem was one of 117 hostages who were released in November 2023 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, coinciding with a week-long pause in fighting. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Thursday, former hostage Mia Schem is engaged to be married to Yinon Hason just one year after she was released from captivity. Mia Schem was one of 117 hostages who were released in November 2023 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, coinciding with a week-long pause in fighting. Terrorists abducted her from the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, 2023. Mia Schem was shot in the arm while trying to flee Hamas terrorists on October 7th after seeing that they set her car on fire. 'It was a split-second decision, whether to stay put and burn to death or go with him,' she said. Mia was thrown onto the back of a pickup truck and was given a makeshift splint. In Gaza, a veterinarian operated on her arm with no anesthetic and told her that she was going to die a hostage. Schem described Gaza civilians she encountered in captivity as 'terrorists' who abetted in her abuse. 'I went through a Holocaust,' Schem said. 'Everyone over there is a terrorist.' 'It was important for me to reflect on the true situation of the people living in Gaza – who they are, and what I went through there.' 'These are families under Hamas. In retrospect, I suddenly realized that I was with a family. Suddenly, I started asking myself why I was in a family’s house? Why are there children here? Why is there a woman here?' Regarding the terrorist guarding her Mia Schem said, 'His wife was outside the room with the children,' she said. 'That was the only reason he didn’t rape me.' The dual French and Israeli citizen described being starved and bullied by the terrorist’s family as the guard didn’t take his eyes off of her as she sat in a darkened room. Mia Schem described the ordeal, 'I (was) closed in a dark room, not allowed to talk, not allowed to be seen, to be heard, hidden.' She added, 'There is a terrorist looking at you 24/7, looking.' Mia Schem told of her fear of being raped and burst into tears. 'There is fear of being raped, there is fear of dying.' She continued, 'His wife hated the fact that he and I were in the same room. You feel like you want a hug, you know, woman to woman, to break down a bit.' 'That’s all you had there. But she was so mean, she had such mean eyes.'

In 2005, 9000 Israelis were evacuated from 25 settlements in Gaza, and since then, many Israelis have advocated for a renewing a Jewish presence in the region. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Housing and Construction Minister Yitzchak Goldknopf said that he inspected the sites of proposed future Israeli settlements in Gaza. On X, Goldknopf posted a picture of himself with Daniella Weiss, the head of the Nachala Settlement Movement, holding up a map of plans for settlements in Gaza. The minister has advocated Israelis establishing homes once again in the Gaza Strip. In 2005, 9000 Israelis were evacuated from 25 settlements in Gaza, and since then, many Israelis have advocated for a renewing a Jewish presence in the region. In his tweet, Goldknopf wrote, 'Today, I toured the Gaza Strip settlements. Jewish settlement here is the response to the horrific massacre and a response to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which, instead of focusing on the 101 hostages, chose to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense.' Goldknopf did not enter Gaza but inspected the territory through binoculars. In another post on X, Nachala thanked Minister Goldknopf for his willingness to 'tour and observe the future settlement locations in Gaza.' The post continued, 'Together, we will build Jewish cities in Gaza, which will help lower apartment prices across the country, with the understanding that without settlement, there is no security. Gaza is ours, forever.' According to Hebrew media, some IDF soldiers, without permission from their superiors, let Weiss in to investigate sites for future Israeli settlements in Gaza. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that Israel should re-occupy Gaza and 'encourage' the Arabs living there to relocate. At a conference in August, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that if there had still been Jewish settlements in Gaza, the October 7 terror attack would never have happened. At the 10th Katif Conference for National Responsibility held Monday, Smotrich said, 'If there had been Jewish settlement in Gush Katif, the [October 7] massacre would not have happened.' He added that Israel's disengagement from Gaza turned Hamas into a 'terror monster.'

Would-be Trump assassin Ryan Routh echoes Democratic rhetoric, ca...	The 58-year-old has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial at a federal detention center in Miami. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Ryan Routh, the second person to attempt to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump, sent Politico a letter from jail that echoes Democratic rhetoric and calls Trump a 'dictator.' In the four-page letter, written before the presidential election, Routh warned that if Trump were to win, the United States needed to 'remove the power of our military by the President and place it with Congress before January.' 'We must limit all Presidential power before Trump seizes our country,' Routh wrote. Routh attempted to assassinate Trump at the then-candidate's West Palm Beach, Fla., golf course in September but fled the scene without firing his weapon after the Secret Service spotted him. The 58-year-old has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial at a federal detention center in Miami. Trump blamed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for inspiring Routh's attempt, citing Biden's and Harris's campaign-trail claims that he is a 'threat to democracy.' '[Routh] believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,' Trump said. 'Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country—both from the inside and out.' Routh praised himself and previous would-be assassin Thomas Crooks as 'ready to die for freedom and democracy.' Crooks tried to assassinate Trump during a July rally in Butler, Pa., striking Trump in the left ear, killing one attendee, and injuring two others before being fatally shot by the Secret Service. Routh sent a similar letter to the Palm Beach Post before the election that also referred to Trump as a 'dictator.' 'Palm Beach should be leading the way and guiding our country hopefully to choose democracy over a dictator,' that letter reads.

Ethiopian Israelis celebrate Sigd with prayers for unity and heal...	Sigd comes from the Aramaic word sged which means to prostrate oneself, as in prayer. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Ethiopian community gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the holiday of Sigd with a prayer gathering at the Western Wall and other events around the capital. Celebrated in Ethiopia for centuries, the holiday symbolizes the community’s longing for Jerusalem and connection to their Jewish heritage. It is now recognized as an official holiday in Israel and takes place 50 days after Yom Kippur. 'The prayer today at the Western Wall was a special and more meaningful prayer because it also dealt with the needs of the hour for the success of the Israeli government, the security forces, the return of the abductees and the physical and mental healing of the wounded,' said Deputy Speaker of the Knesset MK Moshe Solomon, who was born in in Ethiopia’s Tigray region. The holiday is marked with prayers, fasting, and public readings of the Torah on mountaintops, signifying the community’s aspirations to return to Zion. Since their mass immigration to Israel, Ethiopian Jews have continued this practice, often gathering in Jerusalem to mark the day. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Israel’s Ethiopian community stands at 171,600, of whom 54% were born in Ethiopia as of 2023. This includes 1,812 Ethiopian Jews who immigrated that year. Higher education enrollment is steadily increasing, with 4,144 Ethiopian students attending universities and colleges in the 2023/24 academic year, a 29.7% rise since 2016. This progress outpaces the general student population’s growth in higher education during the same period. Sigd comes from the Aramaic word sged which means to prostrate oneself, as in prayer.

Hezbollah believed to have lost as many as 4,000 fighters	According to World Bank estimates, Lebanon suffered $8.5 billion in damages and economic losses during the war—$3.4 billion in physical infrastructure damage and $5.1 billion in economic losses. By Joshua Marks, JNS In the past 14 months, the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah is believed to have suffered as many as 10 times the casualties as it did during the month-long 2006 Second Lebanon War. According to an assessment by Israel’s Channel 12 News and Institute for National Security Studies, the Israeli military believes that approximately 3,000 terrorists were killed in Lebanon, including at least 11 brigade-level commanders, 37 battalion commanders and 46 company commanders. Lebanon’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants, reports 3,823 killed and 15,895 injured during the conflict. A source familiar with Hezbollah’s operations told Reuters on Thursday that as many as 4,000 terrorists may have been killed, the vast majority of them since September, when Jerusalem stepped up its offensive in Lebanon after adding the return of tens of thousands of displaced residents to their homes in the north to its official war goals. The figure is over 10 times the number of Hezbollah members killed during the 2006 war. Hezbollah’s chain of command was also decimated, as highlighted by the Sept. 27 assassination of Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Other high-ranking officials killed include Hashem Safi al-Din, Nasrallah’s successor; Radwan Force commanders Ibrahim Aqil and Wisam al-Tuwail; Ali Karaki, commander of the Southern Front; and Fuad Shukr, the terror group’s chief of staff. Furthermore, some 80% of Hezbollah’s stockpile of 150,000 to 200,000 rockets and 70% of its drone arsenal were destroyed during the war, according to the Channel 12/INSS assessment. Hezbollah launched some 16,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel since joining the war in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the Gaza-based terror organization’s massacre in southern Israel. Nearly 70,000 residents of northern Israel have been internally displaced due to the cross-border attacks from Lebanon. During 'Operation Northern Arrows,' the Israeli military’s name for the northern war, 45 Israeli civilians and 79 IDF soldiers were killed, according to the most recent data from the Alma Research and Education Center, which monitors the northern fronts. Israeli authorities estimate property damage to exceed $273 million, according to Reuters, while Channel 12 and INSS reported that according to World Bank estimates, Lebanon suffered $8.5 billion in damages and economic losses during the war—$3.4 billion in physical infrastructure damage and $5.1 billion economic losses. An analysis of satellite data by The Washington Post in early November revealed that nearly a quarter of all buildings in 25 Lebanese towns and villages near the Israeli border were damaged or destroyed. At least 5,868 buildings were affected, with almost half located in the heavily impacted areas of Aita al-Shaab and Kafr Kila. Approximately 80% of the damage occurred after Oct. 2, 2024, coinciding with Israel’s ground offensive. The war displaced 1.2 million people in Lebanon, primarily from Southern Lebanon and the Dahieh district south of Beirut. Many sought refuge in Christian strongholds like Beirut and Mount Lebanon.

Israeli wheelchair dancing duo wins first place in European champ...	A Ness Ziona native, Margalit, 29, has been in a wheelchair since the age of 14 after suffering from the disease transverse myelitis. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Israeli wheelchair dancer Tomer Margalit and her dance partner Orel Chalaf won first place at the Para Dance Sport European Championship held in Prague on Friday with a combination freestyle routine that was set to Eden Golan‘s Eurovision song 'October Rain.' The dancing duo also dedicated their routine to the hostages still held captive by Hamas terrorists since being abducted on Oct. 7, 2023, during their deadly rampage across southern Israel. The dancers performed parts of their routine while blindfolded and tried to resemble the victims of the Oct. 7 attack by wearing garments that were torn, dirty, or appeared to be blood-stained. A Ness Ziona native, Margalit, 29, has been in a wheelchair since the age of 14 after suffering from the disease transverse myelitis. Chalaf, 21, is a professional Latin dancer, according to Ynet. The two dancers said that many of their competitors in the Para Dance Sport European Championship, as well as others involved in the competition, asked them to explain their dance, costumes and the significance of the song, according to the Israel Paralympic Committee. They welcomed the opportunity to draw awareness to the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre, including the remaining hostages. Margalit and Chalaf said they hope that by the next Para Dance World Championship, the hostages will be back home and there will be no longer a need to call for their return. 'October Rain' has lyrics that directly reference the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack in Israel. The song was initially written for Golan to perform at this year’s Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden. However, it was rejected by the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the contest, for being too political. Golan instead competed in the Eurovision with a reworded version of the song, titled 'Hurricane,' and finished in fifth place in the international competition. The 2024 Para Dance Sport European Championship took place from Nov. 22-24. Margalit shared in an Instagram post that she won first place a total of three times in the competition this year, including in solo dances.

EU warns member states against ‘undermining’ ICC arrest warrants,...	EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell defends International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister and ex-defense minister, warns EU member states not to ignore or 'undermine' the decision by refusing to arrest Netanyahu. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff The 27 member states of the European Union must strictly adhere to last week's decision by the International Criminal Court at The Hague to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the EU's top diplomat said Thursday. Speaking with reporters in Brussels on Thursday, Josep Borrell, the outgoing High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, warned European leaders not to ignore or 'undermine' the ICC arrest warrants, and defended the court's decision last Thursday to arrest the senior Israeli leaders. 'We cannot undermine the International Criminal Court,' Borrell said. 'It is the only way of having global justice. It is the only way to implement accountability.' 'If the Europeans do not support fully the International Court, without procrastination, then the International Criminal Court will not work.' The court's decision against Netanyahu and Gallant, Borrell argued, was 'not political.' The court 'is a legal body formed by respected people who are the best among the profession of judges.' Borrell rejected accusations of antisemitism in the decision against the Israeli leaders, citing the involvement of some Holocaust survivors in advising the ICC. 'Survivors of the Shoah has been among the people who were advising the International Criminal Court. So, the accusation of antisemitism is once again a failure word.' Speaking just days before the end of his term as the EU's foreign affairs chief, Borrell made scathing criticisms not only of Israel's handling of the war against Hamas, but also Israeli society as a whole, claiming extremist elements have created a 'different Israel.' 'Israeli society is being colonised from the inside by extremism and violent people. The colonists are not only expanding on the Israeli territory. The colonisation of the mind of the people is the most dangerous thing that Israeli society is facing because it is undermining the foundations of their democracy.'

IDF carries out drone strike, opens fire on terrorists after Leba...	Suspects approach IDF positions in southern Lebanon, violating ceasefire for the third time in 24 hours, prompting Israeli soldiers to open fire. By World Israel News Staff Israeli soldiers deployed to southern Lebanon opened fire Thursday on suspects who approached villages in the area under IDF control, the Israeli military announced. The movement by the suspected terrorists, including some approaching in vehicles, towards Israeli positions marked yet another breach of the ceasefire which went into effect at 4:00 a.m. Wednesday morning. Hezbollah terrorists violated the ceasefire at least twice on Wednesday, including an incident at 9:07 a.m. during which operatives from the Iran-backed group approached an IDF position in Kfarkela, opposite the Israeli town of Metulla. At 12:08 p.m. that day, Hezbollah terrorists were spotted approaching the Israel-Lebanon border, prompting IDF soldiers to open fire. Israeli forces carried out a drone strike near a vehicle Thursday morning in the southern Lebanese town of Markaba, Galei Tzahal reported Thursday, leaving three injured. According to two Lebanese security officials who spoke with Reuters, Israeli tanks also fired several rounds at a terrorist position in Markaba. One of the two officials claimed that two people were injured by the tank fire, claim Lebanese state media appeared to corroborate. The pro-Hezbollah Al Mayadeen newspaper accused Israel of violating the ceasefire in Markaba. Under the terms of the ceasefire, which was adopted Tuesday by the Israeli security cabinet, Israel and Lebanon both retain the right to self-defense. A letter given to the Israeli government by the Biden administration recognizes Israel's right to act against terrorist threats in southern Lebanon without limit, while the IDF must defer to the Lebanese military outside of southern Lebanon and is only allowed to take action if the Lebanese army is shown to be unwilling or unable to remove the threat.

‘Colossal Failure’ – Mayor of northern Israeli town says Lebanon ...	Margaliot’s Eitan Davidi said that there was no victory in Lebanon because Israel’s residents will not be safe and they should not return home. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The head of a moshav along the border with Lebanon slammed the ceasefire deal with the Hezbollah terror group that went into effect Wednesday, in an interview Thursday with Radio 103FM. Eitan Davidi pulled no punches when noting the deal’s main weakness. 'We repeatedly requested that the distance between us and the villages where Hezbollah terrorists live in Lebanon be extended to two or three kilometers. Everyone, including the military, told us this proximity couldn’t continue.' It is 'a colossal failure' that the government 'didn’t deliver' on a buffer zone, he said, charging that this will 'lead us to a fourth Lebanon war and to the disintegration of the northern communities.' There is no exclusionary strip included in the agreement, but Israel has unofficially reserved the right – backed by the U.S. – to destroy any Hezbollah effort to reinstate its men or weaponry in southern Lebanon after the IDF pullout in 60 days’ time. An Israeli official told Reuters Wednesday that the IDF has leveled enough of Hezbollah’s infrastructure near the border that any attempt to re-enter the area would be seen and there would be enough time for Israel to respond. However, there is no clause in the deal stating that the Lebanese villages cannot be rebuilt, which would provide new hiding places for weapons and missile launchers, and the men to operate them. In its two-and-a-half month foray into Lebanon, IDF forces found that Iran’s chief proxy had built up a formidable armory in every village they entered and a tunnel network that reached the Israeli border in several places. Davidi does not believe that the government would follow through on its threats, due to past experience. 'I don’t trust the prime minister in anything he does—everything he touches fails,' he said. Although all top officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yisrael Katz, have warned that Israel will respond forcefully to every Hezbollah violation, he noted that 'for 18 years — 14 of them under Netanyahu — we bought time at an exorbitant cost' instead of acting against the terrorists. The government is 'ruining everything' in its failure to 'crush' Hezbollah 'more effectively,' and has given the terrorist group 'a second chance,' he said. None of the nearly 70,000 residents who were evacuated from Israel’s north last October for their own safety should return home, he said. 'Don’t go back,' he said. 'They’re sending us like sheep to the slaughter. Be careful. If the Radwan Force enters the North, the lucky ones will be killed outright.' The government has acknowledged that many residents will not be able to return for months yet, because their homes have been partially or completely destroyed due to Hezbollah’s rocket fire and need to be rebuilt, but said that people can return to other communities that are intact, or where the damage is much more limited.

Egyptian negotiators head to Israel with plans for limited Gaza c...	Egyptian delegation set to arrive in Israel Thursday, and will reportedly present proposal for a scaled-down hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire plan, lasting two months. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Egyptian government is slated to dispatch a delegation of intelligence officials to Israel Thursday, for consultations with Israel's negotiating team regarding efforts to reboot stalled hostage deal talks. During the meetings with their Israeli counterparts Thursday, the Egyptian delegation is expected to present an alternate plan, dubbed a 'comprehensive vision' for an agreement, according to sources who spoke with the pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar outlet. The alternate negotiating track would pursue a scaled-down deal initially, with a limited number of hostages to be released during a two-month ceasefire. Unlike the previous formula for talks, the new plan would not mandate a permanent end to the war, nor a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Israel would, during the initial ceasefire, be able to retain its positions in the coastal enclave, though it would be prohibited from undertaking any combat operations. A number of Israeli hostages would be released gradually over the course of the two-month ceasefire, with elderly and ill hostages being released first. 'There is optimism regarding reaching an agreement soon, due to American support,' Egyptian intelligence officials were quoted as saying. However, an Israeli source denied the report regarding the Egyptian delegation's impending arrival, telling Yedioth Aharanoth 'There is no such thing.' Thursday's report in Al-Akhbar adds that under the Egyptian plan, talks would be held during the two-month ceasefire for a permanent end to the war. Once the initial ceasefire goes into effect, Egypt will give Hamas several days to draft and hand over a comprehensive list of all living Israelis still held captive in the Gaza Strip. There are 101 captives remaining in the coastal enclave, though Israeli intelligence estimates that roughly half are likely dead.

China releases 3 Americans in prisoner exchange with Washington	The Biden administration traded the three American citizens for at least one unidentified Chinese citizen in U.S. custody. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon China released three Americans on Wednesday in a prisoner swap between Washington and Beijing, Politico reported. 'We are pleased to announce the release of Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and John Leung from detention in the People's Republic of China,' a National Security Council spokesman told Axios in a statement. The release of Swidan, Li, and Leung comes after years of comprehensive discussions between Biden administration officials and their Chinese counterparts. 'President Biden brought this up when he met with President Xi in Peru two weeks ago and Jake Sullivan brought this up when he was in Beijing [in September] and Secretary Blinken also pushed for this really hard in September at UNGA with [Chinese Foreign Minister] Wang Yi,' a senior administration official said. Swidan was imprisoned in 2012 on drug-related offenses, Li was detained in 2016 on espionage charges, and Leung was jailed in 2021, also on espionage charges. The Biden administration traded the three American citizens for at least one unidentified Chinese citizen in U.S. custody.
