Trump cuts US intelligence sharing to Ukraine	The pause follows a decision early this week by President Donald Trump to freeze future deliveries of weapons to Ukraine. By Jewish Breaking News For nearly three years, an unprecedented river of intelligence flowed from American sources to Ukrainian forces to help defend themselves against Russian forces. That river has now run dry. 'Trump had a real question about whether (Ukrainian) President (Volodymyr) Zelenskyy was committed to the peace process, and he said: ‘Let’s pause, I want to give you a chance to think about that,'' CIA Director John Ratcliffe revealed to Fox News on Wednesday. 'On the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, I think will go away.' It is not immediately clear which specific areas of intelligence sharing have been restricted. In 2024, US media reported that the CIA provided Kyiv the ability to monitor Russian troop movements, support spy networks, and conduct targeted missile strikes. The pause follows a decision early this week by President Donald Trump to freeze future deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace negotiations with Russia. On Tuesday, the embattled Ukrainian leader apologized for last week’s Oval Office confrontation, during which Trump accused him of showing insufficient gratitude for America’s financial and military assistance. Trump’s attitude toward Zelensky notably softened after he disclosed receiving a letter of appreciation from the Ukrainian president, which he highlighted during his State of the Union address. 'My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,' Zelenskyy wrote as quoted by the president. However, Ukrainian missile operators have been reporting screens going dark and targeting coordinates no longer arriving for quite some time now. A Ukrainian military officer familiar with operations of the long-range multiple rocket launching system the Washington Post that for roughly the past month, at least one of the Ukrainian units responsible for launching rockets from U.S. provided systems has not received coordinates to strike more than about 40 miles beyond the contact line.

Shin Bet dismissed Hamas SIM card warning hours before Oct. 7	The Shin Bet report also blamed Israeli government policy from July 2018 until 'Operation Guardian of the Walls' in May 2021, which offered economic benefits to restrain Hamas. By JNS Unusual activity of Hamas’s communications network was noted after midnight on the night of Oct. 6, 2023, hours before the Hamas invasion, which began at 6:30 on the morning of Saturday the 7th, but the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) disregarded the activity as insignificant. At 2:45 a.m. on Oct. 7, Israeli security forces received a report that dozens of SIM cards (necessary for phones to work on a mobile network), were activated in the Gaza Strip, Israel’s Kan News reported on Tuesday. It was not the first such activation. One took place the night before, on Friday evening at around 9 o’clock. (By Wednesday, Oct. 5, some 45 Hamas communication devices had also been activated). However, an intelligence summary by the Shin Bet southern region sent to a group of intelligence and political officials dismissed the activity. 'Today and yesterday there were SIMs in certain areas of Gaza. This is not unusual, since similar tests were carried out by Hamas last year as well,' the summary stated. 'According to the division and the command [leadership], Hamas has not changed its routine. The information is preliminary and there are routine activities in Hamas. A discussion on the matter will be held by the Southern Command Intelligence Officer at 08:30 and by the Southern Command heads at 10:00,' it added. The head of IDF Southern Command, Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, asked, 'Are we on alert?' He was answered in the negative, Kan News reported. The Shin Bet had issued an earlier statement at 1 a.m. on Oct. 7 that also dismissed various indications of a possible attack, Israel Hayom reported. That intelligence report stated: 'A sequence of concerning signs indicates Hamas is preparing for an attack. At the same time, field indicators suggest routine and restraint, with the background of a recently agreed ‘understanding’ leading to the assessment that Hamas is not interested in escalation or starting a campaign at this time.' Later, however, the agency expressed concern about the possibility of an attack, though of a much smaller scale than what transpired. Warning at 3:03 a.m. The Shin Bet issued a warning at 3:03 a.m. on Oct. 7 to the IDF, police and National Security Council, stating: 'We have an indication of activation and activity of Hamas’s communication network across several brigades. We lack details on the nature of the activity, though the cumulative unusual activity, alongside additional indicators, may point to an offensive action.' At about 3:30 a.m., IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi was alerted. He arranged for a situational assessment by phone, which took place 90 minutes later. Halevi, IDF Operations Directorate head Maj. Gen. Oded Basyuk and Finkelman were updated on the signs of an imminent attack. Halevi requested more information. He ordered an update sent to the Israeli Air Force. The Shin Bet director, Ronen Bar, convened a 4:30 a.m. meeting with regional heads. Possible scenarios covered included a localized surprise raid or kidnapping. Instructions were given to prepare intelligence and operational responses, Israel Hayom reported. A 'Tequila' team composed of Shin Bet fighters and members of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, designed to deal with the localized raid scenario, was sent out, according to a recently released internal report by the Shin Bet on its failures to properly respond to the invasion threat. The Shin Bet report also blamed Israeli government policy from July 2018 until 'Operation Guardian of the Walls' in May 2021, which offered economic benefits to restrain Hamas. The agency warned that Hamas was not deterred. 'The investigation demonstrates that the Shin Bet did not underestimate the enemy. On the contrary—there was initiative, pursuit of engagement, and an effort to eliminate the threat at its inception, and yet we failed,' Bar said. Channel 14 commentator Yaakov Bardugo reported on Wednesday that the Cabinet is expected to convene, read the Shin Bet’s report, and recommend the immediate dismissal of Bar in 'disgrace.' 'The document in question reveals a series of professional and moral failures that cannot be rectified,' Bardugo said. With the release of the report, Bar said, 'As the head of the organization, I will bear this heavy burden on my shoulders for the rest of my life. The investigation shows that had the Shin Bet acted differently, both professionally and administratively, in the years leading up to the attack and on the night of the assault, the massacre could have been prevented.'

West faces surge in lone-wolf terrorism, global attacks up 11%	A concerning trend emerged among younger individuals, with one in five terror suspects in Western nations being under 18. By Pesach Benson, TPS The number of countries affected by terrorism increased from 58 to 66 in 2024, reversing nearly a decade of progress in reducing global terrorist incidents, according to a report released on Wednesday. The 12th annual Global Terrorism Index, produced by the Sydney-based Institute for Economics & Peace, noted a rise in fatalities driven by the world’s four deadliest terrorist groups, a growing trend of lone-wolf attacks in the West, and escalating hate crimes linked to the Israel-Hamas war and other geopolitical conflicts. 'The best way to control terrorism is to stop or reduce the number of conflicts,' said Steve Killelea, the institute’s founder and chairman. 'This year’s Global Terrorism Index highlights two key concerns: 98% of all terrorist deaths occurred in conflict zones, and social tensions in the West are fuelling lone actor terrorism.' The Islamic State (IS) remains the world’s deadliest terrorist organization, responsible for 1,805 deaths in 2024 across 22 countries. The group remains most active in Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), with its Khorasan Province (ISK) emerging as one of the fastest-growing jihadist factions. ISK has expanded its operations from one country to five since 2020, producing propaganda in nine languages and launching significant attacks in Iran and Russia. Another major concern is Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which recorded a 90% increase in fatalities, making it the fastest-growing terrorist group. The index also found that one-fifth of all terrorism fatalities took place in Burkina Faso. The West experienced its highest rise in terrorist incidents since 2017, with attacks increasing by 63%. The majority of these were lone-wolf attacks, which accounted for 93% of all fatal incidents in the region over the past five years. Germany, Sweden, Australia, Finland, and the Netherlands reported their first attacks in over five years, with Germany ranking 27th globally following the Magdeburg Christmas market attack. Younger ‘Lone Wolf’ Terrorists A concerning trend emerged among younger individuals, with one in five terror suspects in Western nations being under 18. In the United Kingdom alone, under-18s accounted for 42% of all terror-related arrests. These individuals typically lack formal ties to organized terrorist groups and often combine contradictory extremist ideologies, the report said. Although the Middle East saw a 7% reduction in terrorist attacks in 2024, ongoing violence between Israel and Palestinian terror groups continues to destabilize the region. Israel and Syria both ranked among the ten most affected countries. The Gaza conflict has also intensified global hate crimes, with a 200% rise in antisemitic incidents in the United States and a parallel increase in Islamophobic attacks worldwide, according to the report. 'The Gaza conflict has been, and still is, a catalyst for antisemitism and Islamophobia,' Killelea said. The Sahel region of sub-Sahara Africa remains the most affected by terrorism, accounting for over half of global terrorism deaths in 2024. Burkina Faso recorded the highest number of fatalities, while neighboring Togo saw its worst year on record. The instability is driven by weak governance, ethnic tensions, and competition over mineral resources, particularly gold and uranium. Despite some improvements in certain sub-Saharan regions, Niger saw a dramatic 94% rise in terrorism-related deaths, marking the highest increase globally. The withdrawal of French troops and the growing presence of Russian security forces have further complicated the region’s security dynamics. Terrorism and Technology: A Growing Concern Terrorist organizations are increasingly leveraging emerging technologies to expand their operations, embracing artificial intelligence to produce propaganda and leveraging encrypted messaging apps and cryptocurrency for fundraising. 'The rapid evolution of technology presents both challenges and opportunities,' the report said. 'While extremists exploit encryption and AI for their operations, security agencies are also using AI to detect radicalization earlier and analyze vast amounts of data more effectively.' Although global terrorism deaths remained stable in 2024, the overall threat landscape has grown more complex. The first major attack of 2025, where an IS-pledged individual killed 15 people in New Orleans, signals a potential resurgence of terrorist activities. Security agencies are on high alert following 24 foiled IS-linked plots last year, including a high-profile attempt to target Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna. 'The world must recognize that terrorism is deeply linked to instability,' said Killelea. 'Reducing conflict and addressing social tensions are key to curbing the threat.'

US envoy holds direct talks with Hamas on hostage deal – report	The U.S. is sending the message that if Hamas shows goodwill and the hostages are released, the ceasefire agreement will move forward. By World Israel News Staff An unnamed source told i24 on Wednesday that a U.S. envoy has been in direct talks with Hamas regarding the release of hostages and a ceasefire. A source familiar with the matter reported that U.S. Hostage Envoy Adam Boehler has met several times with Hamas representatives in Qatar. The U.S. is sending the message that if Hamas shows goodwill and the hostages are released, the ceasefire agreement will move forward. Israel has been informed of this development. Currently, 59 hostages remain in Gaza, including five Americans. Edan Alexander is believed to be the only U.S. hostage still alive. Last week, Israel formally agreed to a temporary ceasefire proposed by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, set to last through Ramadan and Passover. Under the terms of the agreement, half of the hostages, both living and deceased, will be released on the first day of the ceasefire’s implementation. The remaining hostages will be freed at the end of the ceasefire period, provided a permanent ceasefire agreement is successfully negotiated. When Hamas rejected this deal, Israel froze the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip over the weekend. Hamas demands that Israel conclude negotiations with the terror group for implementing the second phase of the January 19th ceasefire, as outlined by President Joe Biden in May 2024. The proposed second phase would include a far more comprehensive agreement than either the expired first phase or the American proposal for an extension, and it would involve an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. On Sunday morning, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced that, given Hamas’s refusal to continue releasing Israeli hostages or accept the U.S. proposal, Israel has halted the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip. 'With the conclusion of the first stage of the hostage deal and in light of Hamas’s refusal to accept the Witkoff framework for continuing the talks, to which Israel has agreed, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, the entry of all goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be halted,' the Prime Minister’s Office announced. 'Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas persists in its refusal, there will be additional consequences,' the PMO stated.

Israel reveals Eurovision 2025 song titled ‘New Day Will Rise,’ t...	Renowned Israeli songwriter Keren Peles wrote the lyrics and melody for 'New Day Will Rise,' the musical arrangement and production were done by Tomer Biran, and the French translation was provided by Tamir Hitman. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11 announced on Monday that Israel’s song for the 69th Eurovision Song Contest is titled 'New Day Will Rise,' which will be performed in the international singing competition by Yuval Raphael. The track will feature lyrics in three languages – English, Hebrew, and French. Raphael, 24, performed songs in all three languages while competing on the Israeli singing competition 'HaKochav Haba' ('Rising Star'), whose winner goes on to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest. The Ra’anana native won the 11th season of the Israeli competition that began in November and ended in mid-January. She will represent her home country in this year’s Eurovision, which will take place in Basel, Switzerland, in May. Raphael lived as a child with her family in Switzerland for three years and she is fluent in French. Renowned Israeli songwriter Keren Peles wrote the lyrics and melody for 'New Day Will Rise.' The musical arrangement and production were done by Tomer Biran, and the French translation was provided by Tamir Hitman. Kan 11 will debut the full song on Sunday during a special broadcast. Raphael is a survivor of the Hamas-led terrorist attack at the Nova Music Festival on Oct. 7, 2023. She hid in a roadside bomb shelter near the site of the musical festival and laid beneath dead bodies of victims, pretending to be dead for several hours, until she was rescued. She talked about her experience during the massacre in a speech given before the United Nations Human Rights Committee. Similar to last year, there are already efforts to boycott Israel’s participation in the 2025 Eurovision Song Contest, because of the country’s military actions during its war against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip who orchestrated the deadly rampage across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The Slovenian public broadcaster RTVSLO has asked the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the Eurovision context, to expel Israel from this year’s competition, and the Spanish public broadcaster RTVE said last week that its board of directors will discuss whether it will urge the EBU to do the same. In the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place during the Israel-Hamas war, Israel’s representative Eden Golan finished in fifth place with the song 'Hurricane,' despite facing death threats, being booed on stage by anti-Israel protesters, and having a jury member refuse to give her points because of his personal dislike for Israel. Golan said she was forced to wear a disguise outside her hotel during the competition in Malmo, Sweden, because of the threats she received from those who opposed Israel’s participation in the contest. One of Golan’s fellow competitors in the Eurovision admitted that she received 'so much hate' during the contest. In 2023, Israeli singer Noa Kirel finished third in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song 'Unicorn.' The last time Israel won the Eurovision was in 2018 with Israeli singer Netta Barzilai and her song 'Toy.'

17-year-old Israeli injured in recent car-ramming attack dies of ...	A week before the attack that killed Gur, a string of empty buses exploded sequentially in the Tel Aviv area. By Ben Sales, JTA A 17-year-old Israeli girl who was critically injured in a terror attack last week has died of her wounds. Yahli Gur was one of more than a dozen people wounded when an attacker rammed his vehicle into a bus stop roughly midway between Tel Aviv and the northern port city of Haifa. She was hospitalized, and her death was announced Wednesday, six days after the attack. The ramming was one in a string of recent attacks in Israel that have come amid rising regional tensions. A week before the attack that killed Gur, a string of empty buses exploded sequentially in the Tel Aviv area, prompting the Israeli military to launch an operation in northern Samaria targeting terror groups. Palestinian authorities say tens of thousands have been displaced in the crackdown. This week, a man was stabbed to death in Haifa. And in Gaza, a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that formally expired on Sunday is teetering.

Muslim leaders pay condolence call to family of slain Israeli hos...	Moroccan sheikh and Israeli Arab imams join interfaith delegation paying a condolence call to the Bibas family mourning the murders of Shiri Bibas and her sons Kfir and Ariel. By World Israel News Staff An interfaith delegation of rabbis, imams, and sheikhs from across Israel, along with Sheikh Mohammed Al-Abidu from Morocco, arrived in Kfar Maccabiah on Sunday to console the Bibas family following the return of the bodies of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas, who were brutally murdered in Hamas captivity. The visit was initiated by the Religious Communities Division of the Israeli Ministry of the Interior, the Ohr Torah Interfaith Center, the Interfaith Leadership Forum in Israel, the Druze Religious Council, and additional faith leaders including rabbis from the Chief Rabbinate Council. The delegation came together to offer condolences, standing in solidarity with the bereaved family and denouncing the horrific violence that claimed their loved ones. 'The Interfaith Leaders Forum in Israel stands in deep solidarity with the Bibas family in their immense grief,' said Sheikh Younes Amasha, chairperson of the Interfaith Leaders Forum. 'We call on world leaders to do everything in their power to secure the safe return of all remaining hostages and to work toward ending this cycle of violence. Peace and security are fundamental values in every faith, and we urge all to uphold them with unwavering commitment.' 'Today, we stood together—rabbis, imams, and sheikhs—united in grief and solidarity with the Bibas family,' said Rabbi Aharon Ariel Lavi, Managing Director of the Ohr Torah Interfaith Center. 'This visit was not just about offering condolences, but about reaffirming our shared humanity and the belief that no family should endure such pain. Our faiths may differ, but our commitment to compassion and justice binds us together.' Sheikh Mohammed Al-Abidu, who traveled from Morocco to participate in the delegation, emphasized the shared values of peace and dignity across faiths. 'I came from Morocco to join my brothers in faith in expressing our deepest sorrow and support for the Bibas family. Islam teaches us the sanctity of life, and what happened here is a tragedy for all humanity. We stand together in mourning, and we pray for a future of peace and understanding between all peoples.' Iyad Sirkhan, Director of the Division for Religious Communities at the Ministry of the Interior, added' 'The presence of so many religious leaders here today underscores our shared responsibility to stand against evil and to offer comfort where we can. This tragedy touches us all, and we remain committed to strengthening the bonds between our communities in pursuit of a more just and compassionate society.' Shiri Bibas, her husband Yarden, and the couple’s two sons were abducted by Gazan terrorists on October 7th, 2023. While Yarden was returned to Israel alive on February 1st, 2025, the remains of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were returned to Israel weeks later. Forensic analysis of the bodies suggested that the three were murdered in captivity in November 2023, contradicting Hamas’ claim that they were killed by an IDF airstrike. Israeli officials stated that the Bibas children were apparently killed with 'bare hands,' and that their skulls were later crushed in such a way to make it appear as if they had been killed by rubble from an airstrike.

US rejects alternative plan to Gaza resettlement, argues Gaza ‘un...	White House spokesman rejects Arab-backed proposal to remove Hamas from power while leaving Gazans in place, says US stands by Trump’s vision of resettling the Strip’s population. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The United States on Tuesday rejected an Egyptian plan to rehabilitate the Gaza Strip and remove Hamas from power, without resettling the coastal enclave’s population of roughly two million. Earlier on Tuesday, Arab leaders voted at a Cairo summit to back a 112-page proposal drafted by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government. Egypt pushed the plan as an alternative to President Donald Trump’s Gaza resettlement plan, under which Gazans would be relocated to third-party countries and the Gaza Strip transferred to the United States. Under the Egyptian proposal, a non-partisan interim committee of Palestinian Arabs would be formed to administer Gaza after the formal end of the current war between Israel and Hamas. Once the Palestinian Authority has undergone a major reformation, control of the Gaza Strip would be transferred from the committee to the PA. Foreign aid would pay for the years-long reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip in the Egyptian plan, while Gazans would be temporarily relocated within the Strip during the lengthy period of rebuilding. Hours after the plan was adopted at the Cairo summit, however, White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said Tuesday night that the U.S. would not accept the Egyptian plan, and that the administration remains committed to the president’s resettlement plan. Hughes argued that the Gaza Strip is presently 'uninhabitable,' necessitating their relocation. 'The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable, and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance,' Hughes said. 'President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.'

New IDF chief sworn in amid calls for October 7th probe	Hamas 'not yet defeated,' says Israeli military's new chief of staff, Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir, vowing to complete 'the mission.' By Pesach Benson, TPS Amid calls for a commission of inquiry into the failures of October 7th, Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir was installed as Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces in a ceremony at the military’s Tel Aviv headquarters on Wednesday. 'The task, which I am receiving today, is clear: Lead the IDF to victory,' Zamir said in his address after being conferred with his new rank. 'On the morning of October 7th, the IDF failed in its mission. The border was breached. Our enemies penetrated our communities, slaughtered our people, our children, our women, and our brothers,' said Zamir. 'From the rift, the people of Israel rose and once again proved their strength and unity in moments of testing. Civilians and soldiers, strove for contact, charged and fought individually and in small units, and even paid with their lives.' 'They proved to us that we are brothers. The IDF achieved impressive achievements on the battlefield. We won battles in Gaza and Lebanon, attacked in Yemen and Iran. The murderous terrorist organization, Hamas, has indeed suffered a severe blow, but it has not yet been defeated. The mission is not yet complete,' he added. At least 1,180 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 59 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead. Following the ceremony, Zamir and his predecessor, Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Demands for a Commission of Inquiry Zamir’s promotion comes amid increasing calls for a state commission of inquiry. Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. They may include personal recommendations about individuals under investigation, though the government is not bound to act on them. Critics accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of delaying the inquiry and trying to water down the powers of a commission. Pressed by lawmakers to explain why no state commission of inquiry has been established into the failures of October 7 after 17 months, Netanyahu said on Monday he opposed a 'politically biased' panel. His remarks were marred by scuffles that broke out between bereaved families and Knesset guards. According to a series of army probes, some 5,000 terrorists from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad managed to attack numerous Israeli communities and overrun the army’s border positions. The army’s chain of command broke amid the chaos and soldiers were outnumbered. For years, the army misunderstood Hamas’s intentions, and as October 7 approached, intelligence about the looming attack was misinterpreted. The military was also more focused on threats from Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the probes found. The army’s investigations only deal with issues of operations, intelligence and command, not decisions made by the political echelon. Halevi announced his resignation in January as the army’s investigations were nearing completion. The IDF Chief of Staff serves for three years with the possibility of a one-year extension. The last chief of staff to leave the post before the end of his term was Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz, who resigned in 2007 over IDF failures during the Second Lebanon War of 2006. From Armored Corps to Chief of Staff Zamir, 59, was born and raised in Eilat. He is the first Chief of Staff to begin his career in the Armored Corps. After joining the army in 1984 he became a tank commander, gradually climbing the ranks. He was eventually appointed as Netanyahu’s military secretary from 2012-2015. From 2018 to 2021, he was deputy chief of staff before becoming a visiting research fellow at the Washington-based Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Zamir was also considered for the Chief of Staff in 2018 and 2022. In 2023, he was appointed Director General of the Defense Ministry. He also has degrees from Tel Aviv and Haifa Universities and is a graduate of Wharton University’s General Management Program.

World’s largest semiconductor chipmaker invests $100 billion in U...	Apple also announced last week that it will commit more than $500 billion to expanding its facilities and investments in the United States over the next four years. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest chipmaker, will invest $100 billion in new chip manufacturing plants across the United States, President Donald Trump announced Monday. 'This is a tremendous move by the most powerful company in the world,' Trump said alongside TSMC CEO C.C. Wei. 'It's a matter of economic security, it's also a matter of national security for us.' TSMC will make the investment over the next four years, expanding its U.S. operations with 'cutting-edge' facilities, the Wall Street Journal reported. Semiconductor chips are essential to modern technology, powering everything from cars to computers to smartphones. Demand has surged in recent years, driven by the rapid growth of artificial intelligence, which requires immense computing power. The Taiwanese chipmaker is just the latest tech company to pledge billion-dollar investments in the United States since Trump's return to the White House. Apple announced last week that it will commit more than $500 billion to expanding its facilities and investments in the United States over the next four years. In January, Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank unveiled Stargate, a joint venture aimed at expanding U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure, with a combined investment of $500 billion over the coming years. The Monday announcement comes just weeks after Trump said he was considering tariffs of 25 percent or more on semiconductor imports. Trump views U.S. reliance on foreign chipmakers as a national security risk and has repeatedly pledged to bring more chip manufacturing back to the United States. 'We have to have chips made in this country,' Trump said last month. 'Right now, everything is made in Taiwan, practically, almost all of it, a little bit in South Korea, but everything—almost all of it is made in Taiwan. And we want it to be made—we want those companies to come to our country, in all due respect.' TSMC made its first major U.S. manufacturing investment during Trump's first term, committing $12 billion to build a chip factory in Arizona. 'Back in 2020, thanks to President Trump's vision and support, we embarked on our journey of establishing advanced chip manufacturing in the United States,' the chipmaking giant said in a Monday statement. Also, Honda announced it is shifting production of the Civic from Mexico to the United States, in response to President Donald Trump's planned 25 percent tariffs on Mexican imports, sources told Reuters. Starting in May 2028, the Japanese automaker will begin manufacturing the new Civic hybrid in Indiana to avoid potential tariffs, the sources said. The Civic, one of Honda's top-selling models, is expected to have an annual output of around 210,000 units. The announcement comes just a day before Trump's 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods are set to take effect, part of the administration's efforts to curb drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Trump announced a 30-day pause on the tariffs, which were originally slated to go into effect last month, after Mexico and Canada agreed to deploy troops and personnel to secure their borders with the United States. Mexico has long been a low-cost production hub for automakers, with Honda exporting around 80 percent of its Mexican output to the United States, Reuters reported. Trump has pledged to boost domestic manufacturing, arguing that tariffs help protect American workers and counter foreign 'unfair trade practices.' Since returning to the Oval Office, Trump has increased tariffs on Chinese goods, levied 25 percent tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports, and announced reciprocal tariffs on U.S. competitors and allies alike.

Fury erupts over Hamas terrorists treated in Israeli hospitals	A consensus began forming around expanding prison medical facilities where specialists could provide care without terrorists entering public hospitals. By Jewish Breaking News In Israeli hospitals, victims of terror and the terrorists who harmed them sometimes lie just rooms apart. Since Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 massacre in 2023, an estimated 150 to 200 terrorists have received medical care in the same hospitals as Jewish civilians. On Monday, Israel’s National Security Committee held a meeting to try and end the practice once and for all. 'This situation is infuriating and surreal, and it has no place in the country anymore,' said Committee Chair MK Boaz Bismuth, who described the terrorists receiving treatment as 'sometimes shoulder-to-shoulder with their victims.' Representatives from eight different political parties spanning from the right-wing Otzma Yehudit to the centrist Yesh Atid had jointly requested the meeting. But MK Yulia Malinovsky revealed troubling allegations about transparency. 'There is no official figure because the system is silencing the event, and physicians do not receive authorization to appear before the Knesset committees and talk about the issue,' she said. 'When they do, the system takes revenge on them.' A consensus began forming around expanding prison medical facilities where specialists could provide care without terrorists entering public hospitals. But practical challenges remain. Dr. Miriam Madar of Prison Medical Services pointed out that the medical staff on duty 'cannot always differentiate between life-threatening and non-life-threatening cases.' According to Israel’s Patient Rights Law, hospitals must provide treatment in life-threatening situations or severe disability. In 2024, the Israeli Medical Association published a letter stating that 'treating Hamas terrorists is our duty as doctors.' Due to this law, Oct. 7 architect Yahya Sinwar was saved from certain death when doctors discovered and operated on the former terror leader’s brain tumor in 2004.

Yale Law School scholar is member of US-sanctioned terror fundrai...	Reached for comment, a spokesman for Yale Law School told the Free Beacon that the law school takes the allegations 'extremely seriously' and that Doutaghi has been placed on administrative leave. By Eliana Johnson, The Washington Free Beacon A research scholar at Yale Law School also moonlights as a member of a U.S.-sanctioned terrorist fundraising entity, according to web postings reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. Those postings reveal that Helyeh Doutaghi, the deputy director of Yale Law School’s Law and Political Economy Project, is a member of Samidoun, an organization sanctioned by the U.S. government in October in an announcement that described it as a 'sham charity' and a 'front organization' for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a foreign-designated terrorist organization. Samidoun’s website indicates that Doutaghi, whom it describes as 'a doctoral student of international law and a member of the international Samidoun Network,' delivered a speech in Iran at a Samidoun-sponsored screening of the film Fedayin: Georges Abdallah’s Fight. Abdallah, the founder of the Lebanese Armed Military Forces, was sentenced by a French court to life in prison in 1987, convicted of complicity in the 1982 murders of U.S. military attaché Charles Ray and Israeli diplomat Yacov Barsimantov, as well as involvement in the attempted 1984 assassination of the then-American consul general in Strasbourg, Robert Homme. The relationship between Doutaghi and Samidoun was first reported by the Substack Jewish Onliner and the Buckley Beacon. Reached for comment, a spokesman for Yale Law School told the Free Beacon that the law school takes the allegations 'extremely seriously' and that Doutaghi has been placed on administrative leave. 'We take these allegations extremely seriously and immediately opened an investigation into the matter to ascertain the facts,' the spokesman, Alden Ferro, told the Free Beacon. 'Helyeh Doutaghi’s short-term position as an associate research scholar with the LPE Project expires next month. Until then, she has been placed on an immediate administrative leave pending the outcome of this investigation.' Doutaghi, according to Samidoun, also traveled with a Samidoun group on a 2023 'fact-finding mission' to Venezuela to observe the impact of 'U.S. sanctions and coercive economic measures.' The mission was co-sponsored by three entities, including the International People’s Tribunal on U.S. Imperialism: Sanctions, Blockades, Coercive Economic Measures, of which Samidoun was a co-sponsor. Doutaghi’s connection to Yale Law School is raising eyebrows on Capitol Hill and in the White House, where lawmakers and administration officials have pledged to crack down on anti-Semitism and extremism on university campuses, which receive billions of dollars in federal funding. 'Schools like Yale that coddle anti-Semitic extremists in their student body or faculty should not see a dime of federal funding,' said Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.), the chairman of the Republican Conference and of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services, along with the Government Services Administration, announced on Monday that they are investigating $51 billion in federal grants to Columbia University, citing the school’s 'ongoing inaction in the face of relentless harassment of Jewish students.' President Donald Trump, for his part, said in a social media post that 'Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came.' Doutaghi, who holds an undergraduate degree from Ottawa’s Carleton University and a master’s from King’s College London and who taught at Carleton University before she arrived at Yale, according to her online biography, does not appear to be an American citizen. Yale Law School did not comment on Doutaghi’s immigration status. Yale Law School’s Law and Political Economy Project, where Doutaghi serves as deputy director, is supported by a $600,000 grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which says it 'invests in creative thinkers and problem solvers who are working to ensure everyone has a meaningful opportunity to thrive.' The grant to Yale Law School is intended to develop the philosophy of law and political economy as a response to neoliberalism in order to cultivate a 'wide-ranging shift that will change the way law is studied and taught, the public discussion of legal and political institutions and power, and law’s role in policymaking and political mobilization,' the Hewlett Foundation says. The Hewlett Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Helyeh Doutaghi pictured with Samidoun International Coordinator Charlotte Kates in Venezuela Doutaghi was also scheduled to speak on a panel in October alongside PFLP and Samidoun leader Khaled Barakat, who was personally sanctioned by the U.S. government in October. At the time, the Biden administration indicated that Barakat’s 'fundraising and recruitment efforts support the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel' and that 'Barakat has previously publicly acknowledged Samidoun’s affiliation with the PFLP, despite direction from PFLP leadership to maintain the confidential nature of the relationship.' Helyeh Doutaghi, left, pictured under Samidoun flag The panel was postponed indefinitely, however, due to what Samidoun described as 'the recent Zionist escalation and atrocities against Iran and Lebanon, which represent an existential threat to all peoples in the region and to the planet.' The panel was to discuss how Israel 'intensified the ongoing genocide by assassinating Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas,' which Samidoun described as 'a blatant violation of Iranian sovereignty under international law' that 'propelled the struggle for liberation in the Arab-Iranian region against Zionist-imperialist aggression into a new phase.'

Israel begins leadership of International Holocaust Remembrance A...	Israel will be taking over IHRA’s presidency from the United Kingdom, which headed the organization for the past year with Lord Eric Pickles serving as chair. By David Swindle, The Algemeiner Israel this week assumed the presidency of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), an intergovernmental organization comprising dozens of countries dedicated to combating antisemitism and promoting Holocaust research and education. Dani Dayan — chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel’s national memorial to the Holocaust in Jerusalem — will represent the Jewish state as chair of IHRA. 'We are at a crossroads of generations, and the responsibility of preserving the memory and sharing the stories of the Holocaust will soon rest solely on our shoulders. The voices of victims and survivors demand that we honor their legacy by standing firm against Holocaust denial, distortion, and hatred,' Dayan said in a statement. 'In a world witnessing a dramatic rise in antisemitism and grappling with the challenges and opportunities of emerging technologies, our obligation to historical truth has never been more critical.' Israel’s presidency of IHRA began on Monday and will run through February 2026. 'The antisemitism that resulted in the Holocaust has not been eradicated from the world. On the contrary, over the past year and a half, we have witnessed it intensifying dramatically, targeting both the Jewish people and the Jewish state,' Israeli Foreign Minister Giden Sa’ar added in his own statement, referring to the historic surge in antisemitic incidents around the world since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of southern Israel. 'The new antisemites attack Israel’s right to exist and its right to defend itself,' Sa’ar continued. 'It is our duty not only to remember the Holocaust but also to ensure the existence of the Jewish state, which serves as the guarantee of Jewish continuity for generations to come, while also preserving and passing on the memory of the Holocaust to future generations.' US Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed Israel as the new president of IHRA. 'Today the United States warmly welcomes the start of Israel’s year-long presidency of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), which is committed to supporting accurate Holocaust commemoration, education, and research,' Rubio said in a press statement. 'We also congratulate the United Kingdom on its completion of a highly successful presidency.' Rubio added, 'The United States will partner with Israel during its IHRA presidency to defend the memory and historical fact of the Holocaust and fight the toxic spread of Holocaust denial and distortion and all other forms of antisemitism.' The top American diplomat warned of an aggressive US response to the ongoing rise in antisemitism. 'Holocaust distortion, a shocking form of antisemitism, has proliferated and the poison of antisemitism continues to spread,' Rubio said. 'We see it in violent attacks on Jews, defacement of Holocaust memorials, and dangerous rhetoric in universities and international organizations. President Trump and I have made the United States’ position unmistakably clear: the United States will confront antisemitism with determination and resolve.' Israel will be taking over IHRA’s presidency from the United Kingdom, which headed the organization for the past year with Lord Eric Pickles serving as chair. 'The aim was to bring out the best in the IHRA, engender confidence in difficult times, and, above all, strengthen the organization,' Pickles said at a handover ceremony in Jerusalem. 'Those of us who attended the poignant 80th anniversary ceremony at Auschwitz-Birkenau in January know that we will never see the like again.' Pickles added that '10 years from now, at the 90th anniversary, it is unlikely there will be Holocaust survivors to speak. We are now the custodians of their memory. We must remember and tell the truth.' Recent Legislative Efforts Regarding the IHRA Antisemitism Definition IHRA adopted a 'working definition' of antisemitism in 2016. Since then, the definition has been widely accepted by Jewish groups and lawmakers across the political spectrum, and it is now used by hundreds of governing institutions, including the US State Department, European Union, and United Nations. Dozens of US states have also formally adopted it through law or executive action. In recent months, several additional measures have been taken to expand the definition’s usage. Last month, for example, Australia’s 39 universities announced that the IHRA working definition of antisemitism would be used in assessing antisemitism on campus. The country has seen a string of antisemitic crimes which authorities suspect foreign actors of masterminding. On Feb. 20, US Sens. Katie Britt (R-AL), Tim Scott (R-SC), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) introduced the Antisemitism Awareness Act to implement the definition in the US Department of Education. 'We cannot allow antisemitism to fester in our schools, on our college campuses, or anywhere in our society. This legislation would give the Department of Education the tools to hold students and institutions accountable,' Britt said at the time. 'Any American educational institution authorizing, facilitating, or otherwise supporting pro-terrorism activities should lose every cent of federal funding and subsidization.' On Feb. 26, the Missouri House of Representatives Higher Education and Workforce Development Committee heard the case for a bill to use the IHRA definition at the state’s schools. Two weeks earlier, the Kansas House Committee on Education received a presentation on a bill to codify the definition for the state’s schools. On Feb. 3, the Nebraska Legislature Education Committee conducted a hearing for a bill also seeking to implement the IHRA definition in schools. In late January, state representatives and community members met at the New Jersey statehouse to speak out in support of a bill for the state to adopt the IHRA definition. The legislation’s primary sponsor, Assemblyman Gary Schaer, said that 'today we have an opportunity to do something truly profound — pass bipartisan legislation that will protect a religious minority.' To resolve two lawsuits, Harvard agreed to implement the IHRA definition and to release an annual report for the next five years documenting responses to violations of Title VI of the US Civil Rights Act of 1964. In January, Oklahoma State Rep. John Waldron, a Democrat elected in Tulsa, put forward legislation to use the IHRA definition in the state’s guide for employees assessing bigotry. On Jan. 26, the student government of Rutgers University voted down a measure to embrace the definition. Days earlier, Ireland announced its embrace of the IHRA definition, despite the Irish government’s harsh criticism of Israel and amid a surge of antisemitism in the country. In December 2024, a group of 24 Israeli colleges announced plans to use the IHRA definition.

In a first, UN to recognize victims of Hamas’ psychological terro...	The report will charge Hamas with violating the international laws of war. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The UN will officially recognize for the first time Wednesday Hamas' use of psychological terrorism over the course of the war in Gaza, Kan Reshet Bet reported on its 'This Morning' talk show. The report will charge Hamas with violating the international laws of war due to the many videos it has released of hostages it and other terror groups abducted during the October 7, 2023 invasion of Israel. Dr. Alice Edwards, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, will present her report in the UN branch in Geneva, Switzerland, after having visited Israel and meeting families of those forced to beg for the Israeli government to make a deal to get them released, with their deteriorating physical condition being clear for all to see. Edwards also met with some of the hostages who were freed in the first deal, implemented seven weeks into the war, when most of the female hostages and all the living minors were exchanged for a temporary ceasefire, a huge increase in humanitarian aid, and some 240 Palestinian prisoners, also women and minors. The report clearly defines the families as victims of mental and psychological torture by Hamas. Dr. Shelly Aviv Yeni, volunteer head of the International Law Department at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, told the show’s interviewers that the report 'also mentions that families of kidnapped people often experience depression and chronic anxiety' as a result of the horrific videos, 'which include the use of manipulations intended to confuse family members.' The Forum took credit for getting in contact with Edwards and pushing for her official recognition of Hamas’ psychological terrorism. Its law department also helped achieve Israel’s only other victory at the UN, which has consistently refused to condemn Hamas and regularly equates Hamas’ slaughter of 1,200 people on October 7 with Israeli attempts at self-defense. After a great deal of urging by the Forum and others horrified by Israel’s proof of the terrorists’ rapes, gang rapes and sexualized torture of many victims, Pramila Patten, special representative of the UN secretary-general on sexual violence in conflict, visited Israel with a whole team of investigators. After interviewing victims, their families, first responders, doctors and forensic specialists, she issued a report last March that unequivocally confirmed that Hamas used sexual violence during the October 7 attack and sexually assaulted hostages as well. Edwards’ report will be presented at an event that will include senior UN officials and representatives of the hostages’ families.

Trump to Congress: ‘We’re bringing hostages back from Gaza’	President Trump touts return of hostages during ceasefire deal in address to joint session of Congress, says his administration will expand Abraham Accords in Mideast. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress Tuesday, touting the return of hostages from the Gaza Strip during the six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. During the address, which was attended by several released hostages from Gaza and the families of a number of freed captives, Trump made no mention of the invitees, but did highlight the return of 33 hostages, including 25 living captives. 'In the Middle East, we’re bringing back our hostages from Gaza,' Trump said. The president also vowed that his administration would expand upon the Abraham Accords, initiated in 2020, but declined to provide details. 'A lot of things are happening in the Middle East,' the president hinted. 'In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords. And now we’re going to build on that foundation, to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.' Trump urged Congress to fund the creation of a missile defense network comparable to Israel's Iron Dome system, comparing his plan to Ronald Reagan's aspiration to create a laser defense network, dubbed the Strategic Defense Initiative, capable of destroying ballistic missiles aimed at the U.S. 'As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future,' Trump continued. 'As a first step, I’m asking Congress to fund a state of the art 'golden dome' missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the U.S.A. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn’t there. Not even close. But now we have the technology.' 'And other places have it. Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right?'

IAF drone strike kills top Hezbollah naval commander	Images of an upside, burning car posted online by Lebanese media outlets showed the aftermath of the strike. By World Israel News Staff A Hezbollah naval commander planning attacks against the Jewish State was assassinated in a drone strike, the Israeli Air Force confirmed in a statement. Hather Said Hashem was the officer responsible for the naval operations of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, according to the Israeli military. 'Hashem’s activities were a threat to the State of Israel and its citizens, and blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,' the army added in the statement. The IDF posted a video of the strike on its official X account, which targeted Hashem's vehicle as he drove near Tyre, Lebanon. Images of an upside, burning car posted online by Lebanese media outlets showed the aftermath of the strike. As of March 2025, a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon is still in effect. Under the terms of the agreement, Israel may take action against terrorists who pose an imminent threat to its security. In mid-February, IDF troops withdrew from southern Lebanon, with the exception of five key border outposts. Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israel would maintain a presence in the region for the time being. 'There is a buffer zone. It wasn't easy but I stood my ground, and we received a green light from the United States. We gave them a map, and we are staying indefinitely – this is situation-dependent, not time-dependent,' Katz said at a defense conference, in a summary of his remarks released by his office. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the areas in Lebanon where IDF soldiers remain 'strategic high points' that are 'necessary for our security.' Saar said that Israel would 'temporarily' remain at those outposts, until 'Lebanon fully implements its side of the deal.' Under the agreement, Lebanon must clear its southern border region with Israel of all Hezbollah operatives - a task which it is likely incapable of achieving.

Overturning Biden-era decision, Marco Rubio blacklists Houthis as...	Secretary of State restores terrorist designation for the pro-Iranian Houthi movement in Yemen, reversing the whitelisting by the Biden administration. By World Israel News Staff The United States State Department on Tuesday blacklisted the Yemenite Houthi movement, restoring its designation as a terrorist organization. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the blacklisting, more than a month after President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing the State Department to put the pro-Iranian group back on the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list. 'The Houthis' activities threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade,' Rubio said, referencing Houthi missile attacks on Israel and the targeting of ships passing through the Red Sea. 'The United States will not tolerate any country engaging with terrorist organizations like the Houthis in the name of practicing legitimate international business.' At the end of President Trump's first term in office, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added the Houthi group Ansar Allah to the FTO, after it allied itself with the Hamas terror organization. Pompeo's successor, Antony Blinken, reversed the move in February 2021, dropping Ansar Allah from the State Department's terror blacklist. The Biden administration did place the Houthis on a separate terror blacklist, the Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) list, in January 2024, following a spate of attacks by Houthi terrorists on ships passing through the Red Sea. However, the SDGT listing provided limited tools for sanctioning the Houthis in comparison to the FTO listing. On January 22nd, Trump called for Ansar Allah to be put back on the FTO blacklist. 'Under President Trump, it is now the policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the Houthis’ capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and thereby end their attacks on US personnel and civilians, US partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea,' the White House said in a press release.

Father of Nova Festival victim commits suicide	Vladislav Bongart, 48, took his own life some 16 months after his daughter Sofia was murdered in music festival massacre. By World Israel News Staff The father of a young woman who was murdered at the Nova Festival on October 7th, 2023, committed suicide last week, some 16 months after his daughter's slaying. Sofia Bongart, 21, was murdered in the terror onslaught. A resident of Karmiel in northern Israel, she had told her parents, Anna and Vladislav, that she was going to a rave in the western Negev region. She attended the festival with her best friend since childhood, Liraz Nisan, who was also murdered that day. 'Sofia was a mature and responsible girl, and I always trusted her and never worried. She traveled a lot, and my only concern was road safety. We had an agreement that she would always update me when she reached her destination. At 6 a.m., when they got to Nova, she texted me: ‘I arrived,’' Anna told Hebrew-language news outlet Walla. Within minutes of their arrival, Hamas launched a major barrage of rockets, sending attendees scrambling for cover. 'People around them were told to lie on the ground and wait for it to be over. She trusted the army so much,' Anna said. Bongart eventually sought refuge from the rocket barrage in a roadside bomb shelter near Kibbutz Be'eri. Hamas terrorists threw grenades and opened fire into the structure, killing Bongart's friend Nisan. According to the report, Bongart made a desperate attempt to flee to safety, and was shot dead by terrorists once she left the bomb shelter. In her final message to her mother and father, sent around 8 a.m., Bongart wrote told her parents that she was blessed to have them and that she loved them. Her father, Vladislav, was devastated by her death. Twice a week, he brought flowers to her grave. 'We put on a mask and carried our pain, but Vladislav never shared what he was going through,' she said. Anna said that her husband did not tell acquaintances about his daughter's murder. 'He didn’t want people looking at him with pity,' she said. 'He refused help and was consumed from within. But I never feared he would harm himself.' Vladislav took his own life at home in Karmiel in late February, at the age of 48. The family has one surviving daughter, Evalina.

Israeli students outraged after prof. calls IDF soldiers ‘baby-ki...	Letter to Ben Gurion University administration demands firing of professor who says IDF troops execute infants. By World Israel News Staff More than one thousand Israeli students at Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba are calling for the firing of a professor, who claimed on social media that IDF soldiers murder infants. Dr. Sebastian Ben-Daniel, a computer science lecturer who uses the moniker John Brown on X, has made a number of incendiary comments against the Israeli military in recent weeks. Statements from Ben-Daniel's account include 'IDF soldiers are baby killers because they were raised to be baby killers,' and that 'IDF soldiers are murderers' whom only 'The Hague can hold the accountable.' 'We, the signatories of the attached letter, students at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, condemn and oppose the defamatory and unfounded statements that accuse us and our military comrades of infanticide,' read a letter demanding Ben-Daniel's firing, written by the Zionist watchdog group Im Tirtzu. The letter was signed by 1,153 students. 'On October 7, we enlisted to defend the State of Israel and its citizens after the terrible massacre carried out by the terrorist organization Hamas,' the letter continued. 'We will not agree to the continued employment of a lecturer who echoes anti-Semitic propaganda. We call on you, the university president, to dismiss him immediately.' Ben-Gurion University President Professor Daniel Haimovitch responded to the letter on his Facebook page, stating that the school was taking the matter seriously. 'Unfortunately, in recent days the university has found itself at the heart of a public storm following the exposure of the offensive and false statements of an outside lecturer against IDF soldiers,' Haimovitch wrote. 'These are offensive, libelous statements that deeply hurt our students, our faculty and all members of our community/ We have forwarded the matter to the relevant authorities for further processing. From now on, the duty of responsibility for his actions and their meaning lies with him&#8230; We cannot - and will not - remain silent in the face of statements of this kind.' Notably, the statement did not specify possible consequences for Ben-Daniel, including whether he would be fired. 'Dr. Ben Daniel is invited to move to teach at Berkeley or Columbia University in the U.S., where his antisemitic views will be accepted,' Ernest Ivanitzky, student coordinator for Im Tirtzu at Ben-Gurion University, said in a media statement.

Trump will pull funding from campuses that don’t crack down on ‘i...	All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.' By Ben Sales, JTA President Donald Trump threatened to pull funding from campuses that permit 'illegal protests,' said he would deport foreigners involved in those protests and appeared to endorse a ban on masks at demonstrations. The threat, made on social media, came a day after his administration said it was considering stopping more than $50 million in federal contracts with Columbia University over its 'ongoing inaction in the face of relentless harassment of Jewish students.' Columbia has faced bipartisan criticism after pro-Palestinian protesters recently occupied a building at Barnard College and injured a school employee. The president published the post hours before his speech to Congress on Tuesday. 'All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests,' he wrote on Truth Social. 'Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS! Thank you for your attention to this matter.' The post repeated a number of threats or pledges Trump made during his presidential campaign and since taking office in January. He has repeatedly taken aim at schools’ funding, either by threatening massive fines or a cut to federal grants. An executive order he signed instructed the administration to take 'actions to remove' non-citizen students who endorse terrorism. In endorsing a mask ban, Trump has joined a coalition of organizations pushing such measures in New York City and elsewhere. Proponents say mask bans at public gatherings prevent people from shielding their identity while breaking the law or harassing others. Opponents of the bans say they contravene free speech and the right to protest. Legislation banning 'masked harassment' has been introduced in New York’s state legislature. A number of Jewish groups support the mask ban, and Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt touted the idea at the group’s conference this week.

Arab leaders accept Egyptian plan for Gaza, oppose Trump’s ‘Gaza ...	Egypt, Jordan, and Gulf Arab states fear Trump's plan for an exodus of Palestinians and a US rebuild of Gaza would destabilize the entire region. By Algemeiner, WIN and Reuters Arab leaders adopted an Egyptian reconstruction plan for Gaza on Tuesday that would cost $53 billion and avoid displacing Palestinians from the enclave, in contrast to US President Donald Trump’s 'Middle East Riviera' vision. Egypt’s Reconstruction Plan for Gaza is a 112-page document that includes maps of how its land would be re-developed and dozens of colorful AI-generated images of housing developments, gardens and community centers. The plan includes a commercial harbor, a technology hub, beach hotels, and an airport. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said the proposal, welcomed in subsequent statements by Hamas and criticized by Israel, had been accepted at the closing of a summit in Cairo. Sisi said at the summit that he was certain Trump would be able to achieve peace in the conflict that has devastated the Gaza Strip. The major questions that need to be answered about Gaza’s future are who will run the enclave and which countries will provide the billions of dollars needed for reconstruction. Sisi said Egypt had worked in cooperation with Palestinians on creating an administrative committee of independent, professional Palestinian technocrats entrusted with the governance of Gaza after the end of the war. The committee would be responsible for the oversight of humanitarian aid and managing the Strip’s affairs for a temporary period, in preparation for the return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), he said. The other critical issue is the fate of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, the PA’s rival, which triggered the Gaza war by attacking Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. The Islamist faction that has run Gaza since 2007 said in a statement it agrees to the Egyptian committee proposal. Hamas has agreed it will not field candidates to the Cairo-proposed committee, but it would have to give its consent to the tasks, members and the agenda of the committee that would work under the PA’s supervision. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said late on Tuesday the names for the individuals participating in the committee had been decided. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the PA, said he welcomed the Egyptian idea and urged Trump to support such a plan that would not involve displacing Palestinian residents. Abbas, in power since 2005, also said he was ready to hold presidential and parliamentary elections if circumstances allowed, adding his PA was the only legitimate governing and military force in the Palestinian Territories. Hamas said it welcomed the elections. Abbas has seen his legitimacy steadily undermined by Israeli settlement building in the West Bank, which he oversees. Many Palestinians now regard his administration as corrupt, undemocratic, and out of touch. The Israeli foreign ministry in a statement called the plan 'rooted in outdated perspectives' and rejected the reliance on the PA while complaining that Hamas was left in power by the plan. Any reconstruction funding would require heavy buy-in from oil-rich Gulf Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which have the billions of dollars needed. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa said the reconstruction fund would seek international financing as well as oversight and likely be located in the World Bank. The UAE, which sees Hamas and other Islamists as an existential threat, wants an immediate and complete disarmament of the group, while other Arab countries advocate a gradual approach, a source close to the matter said. A source close to Saudi Arabia’s royal court says the continued armed presence of Hamas in Gaza was a stumbling block because of strong objections from the United States and Israel, which would need to sign off on any plan. In a speech at the summit, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan said international guarantees were needed that the current temporary ceasefire would remain in place and supported the PA’s role in governing the strip. Leaders of the UAE and Qatar did not speak during open sessions of the summit. Hamas was founded in 1987 by Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian Intifada, or uprising. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri on Tuesday rejected Israeli and US calls for the group to disarm, saying its right to resist was not negotiable. Abu Zuhri told Reuters the group would not accept any attempt to impose projects, or any form of non-Palestinian administration or the presence of foreign forces. Since Hamas drove the Palestinian Authority out of Gaza after a brief civil war in 2007, it has crushed all opposition there. Egypt, Jordan, and Gulf Arab states have for almost a month been consulting over an alternative to Trump’s ambition for an exodus of Palestinians and a US rebuild of Gaza, which they fear would destabilize the entire region. Israel was unlikely to oppose an Arab entity taking responsibility for Gaza’s government if Hamas was off the scene, said a source familiar with the matter. But an Israeli official told Reuters that Israel‘s war aims from the beginning have been to destroy Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. 'Therefore, if they are going to get Hamas to agree to demilitarize, it needs to be immediately. Nothing else will be acceptable,' the official said.

Netanyahu: 'Furthermore, the Shin Bet director deemed it unnecessary to wake the prime minister on the night of the attack, despite it being the most critical and fundamental decision imaginable.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following the release of Shin Bet's probe into Hamas's October 7th attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the agency for failing to inform him of Hamas's plans to attack Israel. In a statement, Netanyahu said, 'The intelligence picture was misinterpreted, leading to a flawed perception.' 'In the ongoing intelligence assessments, including just days before the massacre, the Shin Bet's central thesis was that Hamas aimed to maintain calm and that no escalation was expected,' the statement continued. The prime minister's statement responded to Shin Bet’s probe, which suggested that government policies were partly to blame for Hamas's decision to carry out their attack plans. Shin Bet stated that government policies regarding the Temple Mount, the treatment of Palestinian prisoners, and the judicial overhaul were likely contributing factors to Hamas's decision to attack Israel. Netanyahu continued in his statement, 'Bar firmly stated that Hamas aimed to avoid a confrontation with Israel. He even believed there was potential for long-term stability in Gaza if Israel offered a positive economic outlook,' the statement said. 'Most alarming of all, the Shin Bet and its director failed to address, even at the most basic level, the 'Walls of Jericho' plan to destroy Israel,' Netanyahu’s statement added. 'This was neither included in the ongoing intelligence assessments nor considered on the night of October 7, despite the fact that the Shin Bet had been aware of the plan since 2018,' the statement continued. 'Furthermore, the Shin Bet director deemed it unnecessary to wake the prime minister on the night of the attack, despite it being the most critical and fundamental decision imaginable,' it said. Shin Bet acknowledged its failures in its October 7th probe, including: failing to warn the public about Hamas's plans to attack, misunderstanding Hamas’s intentions, failing to recognize Hamas as having a military and instead viewing them solely as a terror group, and the belief that terrorists were planning a major attack in Judea and Samaria rather than Israel's southern border communities.

Hostage seeks to return religious books to soldier who left them ...	Freed hostage Omer Shem Tov recited 'Kiddush' (Sabbath sanctification) with grape juice he received while in captivity.

The Chabad booklet, Dvar Malchus, which contained religious texts for weekly study, belonged to a soldier named Yoel Elbaz. The family said they are trying to locate the soldier to express their gratitude. Shem Tov also found a copy of Tehillim, Chapter 100, and read a Hebrew translation of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest five times. Omer’s father, Malki, told Israel National News that his son fought against the odds to maintain his religious observance during captivity. Shem Tov recited Kiddush (Sabbath sanctification) with grape juice he received while in captivity. Malki Shem Tov commented, 'These things really gave him strength. The faith, knowing that he was being watched over from above, helped him survive.' Despite the meager rations, Omer Shem Tov wanted to fast on Yom Kippur but didn’t know the date. He realized that the Israeli radio station he had been allowed to listen to had gone silent, which meant it was Yom Kippur. He expressed disappointment that he hadn’t known ahead of time so he could have fasted. 'We never lost hope or faith; we stayed positive, even during the hardest times,' he said. 'There were certainly challenges along the way, but we always knew Omer would come home. He shared with us that throughout his entire captivity, he held onto the certainty that he would return.

Air France denies deliberately mislabeling non-kosher meals on fl...	More troublingly, Air France has not indicated whether the flight attendant involved would face any consequences or if staff would receive additional training on respecting religious dietary requirements. By Jewish Breaking News Air France is facing scrutiny after a flight attendant allegedly labeled regular meals as kosher and served them to a Jewish family on a flight from Mauritius to Paris last month. Traveling with eight family members, including children as young as 3 and an elderly relative of 73, Divora Marinelli had ordered kosher meals in advance for their 12-hour flight. Upon check-in, the family was informed their kosher meals wouldn’t be available. Already facing a long journey without proper food, they boarded the plane resigned to hunger, she tells DansDeals. What happened next went beyond mere inconvenience. After takeoff, flight attendants served the family meals with 'KSML' written on them—the standard industry abbreviation for kosher meals. But Marinelli quickly realized something was wrong. The meals weren’t kosher at all. Instead, a flight attendant had apparently taken regular meal trays and simply written 'KSML' on them, presenting them as kosher-compliant. By the time Marinelli discovered the deception, some of her children had already begun eating the non-kosher food. Her son had even directly asked a flight attendant if his meal was kosher, to which the attendant reportedly confirmed it was. Marinelli immediately alerted the lead flight attendant, who investigated the situation. According to Marinelli, the supervisor confirmed that another crew member had indeed marked regular meals as kosher and distributed them to the family under false pretenses. The lead flight attendant then proceeded to document the incident in an official report. According to DansDeals, the airline’s response has been minimal. Each affected family member received a 30 Euro voucher as compensation. More troublingly, Air France has not indicated whether the flight attendant involved would face any consequences or if staff would receive additional training on respecting religious dietary requirements. When the story gained traction on social media, Air France issued a statement claiming otherwise. 'Due to a supply shortage at the local caterer, customers were informed when they arrived at the airport that their special meals would be unavailable and that vegetarian product trays would be provided as a replacement. Once on board, these trays were served to them, marked by the local caterer KSML, purely so that they could be identified by the crew to facilitate service,' the Airline wrote on X. 'Air France regrets this confusing identification and points out that the crew never intended to mislead customers about the quality of the tray offered and that customers were well aware of the vegetarian meal served.' However, Marinelli firmly says she was 'absolutely not informed' that a vegetarian product would be offered and would have refused that, noting that other religious Jews were on the flight as well. She also disputed Air France’s claim about unintentional mislabeling, referencing the report filed by the lead flight attendant. When asked by DansDeals whether they would provide a copy of the report, Air France responded, 'We do not have any further comments beyond the statement we shared.'

Israeli army restricts soldiers’ social media use following Oct. ...	The investigation found that photos shared by soldiers on their first and last days in their roles allowed Hamas to create a detailed model of the Nahal Oz base. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israel Defense Forces is moving to tighten restrictions on soldiers’ social media use after an internal probe revealed that Hamas exploited online posts to map out Nahal Oz base before its October 7 attack. During the October 7 attack on Nahal Oz, 53 soldiers were killed and 10 more were taken captive. New measures include a ban on photography inside IDF facilities, strict penalties for violations, and security classifications for a wider range of military roles. Soldiers and officers in various positions will also be prohibited from using Facebook and other platforms to prevent intelligence leaks. Additionally, the army will restrict the public from filming civilian-attended ceremonies and events. The investigation found that photos shared by soldiers on their first and last days in their roles allowed Hamas to create a detailed model of the base. This intelligence enabled the group to locate generators, surveillance cameras, safe rooms, the coordination center, patrol movements, and the sleeping quarters of commanders. While the probe noted that Hamas was also able to gather intelligence on Nahal Oz using drones and from the news media, investigators found that soldiers left enough indicators on social media to give Hamas an almost complete breakdown of the base ahead of the October 7 attack. Palestinians captured during the war told interrogators they were even able to build models of parts of Nahal Oz for training. Investigators also found that soldiers at Nahal Oz received no warning before the attack. Protocols did not address responding to rocket fire or protecting unarmed non-combat soldiers, and that drills simulating a ground assault had not taken place in years. According to a series of army probes — summaries of which were released publicly on Thursday — some 5,000 terrorists from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad managed to attack numerous Israeli communities and overrun the army’s border positions. The army’s chain of command broke amid the chaos and soldiers were outnumbered. For years, the army misunderstood Hamas’s intentions, and as October 7 approached, intelligence about the looming attack was misinterpreted. The military was also more focused on threats from Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah in Lebanon. The army’s probes only deal with issues of operations, intelligence and command, not decisions made by the political echelon. There have been growing calls for the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to investigate political and military failures. Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. They may include personal recommendations about individuals under investigation, though the government is not bound to act on them. Pressed by lawmakers to explain why no state commission of inquiry has been established into the failures of October 7 after 17 months Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he opposed a 'politically biased' panel. His remarks were marred by scuffles that broke out between bereaved families and Knesset guards. The last state commission of inquiry, which investigated Israel’s worst civilian disaster — a stampede that killed 45 people at a holy site on Mount Meron — held Netanyahu personally responsible for the tragedy in a report released in April. At least 1,180 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 59 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

Israel: Hamas has ‘a few days’ to agree to extended truce	If no ceasefire extension is reached, the plan is to conquer the Gaza Strip with more than 50,000 soldiers, relocating the civilian population to humanitarian zones and waging a 'ruthless ground campaign.' By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS The Hamas terror organization only has 'a few days' to agree to a U.S.-proposed ceasefire extension, an Israeli government spokesman confirmed on Tuesday. 'If they don’t, the Cabinet will convene and decide on the next steps,' Omer Dostri, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s spokesman, told Israel’s Army Radio. The Security Cabinet, which is responsible for defense-related decisions and composed of senior ministers, is scheduled to meet on Sunday at 4 p.m., the Ynet outlet reported on Tuesday, noting that the forum would convene only after Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir was sworn in as the 24th chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces. Jerusalem is developing a plan to resume the war in the Strip in four to six weeks in a decisive campaign to wipe out Hamas, The Washington Free Beacon reported on Friday, citing several current and former Israeli officials. Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed Zamir to develop the plan, which is projected for completion when he enters office on Thursday, according to the report. The plan is to conquer the entire Gaza Strip in one fell swoop with more than 50,000 soldiers, relocating the civilian population to humanitarian zones and waging a 'ruthless ground campaign' in terrorist-heavy areas that will receive no humanitarian aid, according to the Beacon. The campaign is to commence with a heavy aerial assault, followed by a reduction of aid entering the Strip. IDF divisions would simultaneously enter the Strip in the north, center and south, carving it into three parts. The campaign could be paused if the Hamas leadership agrees to free captives, or if it disarms and goes into exile, the report added. Israeli assessments indicate that Palestinian terrorist groups in the Strip are still holding 59 hostages. Of these, 24 are believed to be alive—all men—while 35, including three women, are believed to be deceased. Two of the living hostages and three of the deceased are foreign nationals. Phase 1 of the ceasefire, which went into effect on Jan. 19, formally expired at midnight on Saturday. Jerusalem subsequently announced it had suspended all humanitarian aid after Hamas rejected U.S. Mideast envoy Witkoff’s plan to extend the temporary ceasefire deal during the Ramadan and Passover period. 'Saturday was the last day of the first phase of the framework for the release of our hostages. Israel has fully implemented its part, including the part of humanitarian aid, fully and down to the last day,' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told international media on Tuesday. He noted that Israel had agreed to the U.S. bridging proposal, but that 'unfortunately, Hamas rejected the offer. Accordingly, Israel stopped enabling the entry of aid into Gaza.' Any aid that ends up in the hands of Hamas 'is not humanitarian,' charged the foreign minister. 'Unfortunately, Hamas’s takeover of goods turned it into an economic engine for them. It became the number one budget income for Hamas in Gaza. They use that money for terror, to restore terror capabilities and get more young terrorists to join their organization.' Not content with appropriating the aid, 'They are shooting the civilians who try to get access to the aid. They use it as an engine in their war against Israel,' Jerusalem’s top diplomat added, declaring: 'This can not continue and will not continue.'

By World Israel News Staff Russia has deepened its ties to Iran’s production of missiles over the past year, according to a report by Reuters. Based on an analysis of travel records, the report found that two delegations of senior Russian missile specialists traveled to Iran over the past. Documents cited by the report show that seven Russian weapons experts traveled from Moscow to Tehran on two separate occasions, April 24 and September 17, 2024. Passenger manifests and booking records indicate that six of the seven carried official state business passports, a designation used by government officials and military personnel abroad. The exact purpose of these visits remains unclear. However, both trips took place just weeks before major Iranian attacks on Israel, on April 14 and October 1. Following the Iranian offensives, Israeli counterstrikes targeted Iranian air defenses, some of which were supplied by Russia. A senior Iranian defense ministry official stated that Russian missile specialists had made multiple visits to Iranian missile production sites, including underground facilities, last year. Some of these visits reportedly occurred in September, though the specific locations remain undisclosed. A Western defense official monitoring Iran-Russia defense relations confirmed to Reuters that an unspecified number of Russian missile experts visited an Iranian missile base near the port of Amirabad on the Caspian Sea coast in September. The seven Russian specialists identified in the records have extensive military backgrounds, with two holding the rank of colonel and two ranked as lieutenant colonels. Their expertise spans air-defense missile systems, artillery, rocketry, advanced weapons development, and missile testing. However, employment records reviewed by Reuters range from 2021 to 2024, leaving uncertainty about their current roles. When contacted by phone, five of the identified individuals denied traveling to Iran or working for the military, while another declined to comment and one disconnected the call. The revelations underscore growing military collaboration between Russia and Iran, particularly in missile technology, at a time of heightened regional tensions and evolving geopolitical alliances.

Trump suspends weapons shipments to Ukraine following showdown wi...	According to Fox News, the suspension primarily affects previously approved aid not yet delivered as Trump has not given a penny to Ukraine since taking office. By Jewish Breaking News Following a dramatic showdown in the Oval Office last week with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, President Donald Trump has paused all weapons shipments to the war-torn country. The Ukrainian president was told to leave and 'come back when he is ready for peace' after Trump accused him of 'gambling with' a third world war. On Monday, Trump expressed fresh outrage at Zelensky for suggesting the war’s end could be 'very, very far away.' 'This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer!' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelensky, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the US. Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?' Trump’s warnings became more explicit when speaking with reporters. 'It should not be that hard a deal to make. It could be made very fast,' he said. 'Now, maybe somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, and if somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, I think that person won’t be around very long.' Hours later, the White House announced the suspension of all US military aid to Ukraine. 'The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,' the White House statement reads. According to Fox News, the suspension primarily affects previously approved aid not yet delivered as Trump has not given a penny to Ukraine since taking office. Congress has approved $175 billion in total assistance for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion nearly three years ago. In December, just before leaving office, Joe Biden announced an additional $5.9 billion in security and budget assistance. The aid has been crucial for Ukraine’s survival. Some American funds help pay teachers’ and doctors’ salaries and keep basic government functions running while the country fights Russian forces. In total, the US has pledged $31.7 billion worth of weapons through presidential drawdown authority, with most of it already shipped. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is looking to warm relations with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. State and Treasury departments have reportedly been ordered to draft lists of sanctions that could be lifted during upcoming talks with Russian officials over Ukraine’s fate.

UNRWA official calls aid agency a casualty of October 7 during Ha...	During his remarks, Abu Hasna said Israel used October 7 as an excuse 'to liquidate UNRWA' and push the international community into ditching the aid group. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon A spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) attended a Hamas-affiliated webinar last month alongside one of the terror group's operatives and claimed that officials with the embattled aid agency were 'also victims' of the October 7 terror rampage through Israel. Adnan Abu Hasna, an UNRWA media adviser, participated in a February 19 online briefing organized by the Lebanon-based advocacy group Association 302 for Palestinian Refugees. The organization is led by Ali Hweidi, who also serves as an official in the Popular Conference for Palestinians Abroad, a group that Israel designated as a Hamas front in 2021. The briefing, which also included a Hamas official, was broadcast on a media outlet linked to the terror group. Abu Hasna argued that UNRWA was also a casualty on the day Hamas slaughtered more than 1,200 Israelis in cold blood, an attack the terrorists carried out alongside more than a dozen UNRWA employees. The aid group's participation on October 7 prompted international donors, including the United States, to temporarily pull their funding, leaving it scrambling for cash. The Trump administration permanently froze all U.S. funding to UNRWA shortly after taking office. 'At the end of the day, we at UNRWA were one of the victims of what happened on October 7,' Abu Hasna said in Arabic during the briefing, which was titled 'UNRWA After the Ban Law and the Arrival of Trump: Dangers and Coping Mechanisms.' It centered on ways the aid group and its supporters can sow divisions between the Trump administration and European countries that still support UNRWA's role as the chief humanitarian aid group in Gaza. Israel in January formally banned the aid group from operating, citing its role in the October 7 attack and longstanding concerns over its anti-Semitic educational materials. Speaking alongside UNRWA's Abu Hasna was Ahmed Al-Hajj, a Hamas official based in Lebanon, and Abdelhamid Siyam, a Rutgers University professor who formerly worked for the United Nations. Another participant, Saleh Abdel Ati, is a former member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a designated terror group. Abu Hasna's participation in the briefing did not raise any red flags with UNRWA, even as the agency tries to rehabilitate its image in the wake of October 7. In the months after the war in Gaza broke it, Israel revealed that scores of UNRWA employees are card-carrying Hamas foot soldiers. Hamas also used UNRWA-run facilities, including hospitals, to hide weapons, transport hostages, and plan further terror attacks on Israel. Abu Hasna, an UNRWA spokesman told the Washington Free Beacon, 'is permitted to participate in public events to clarify the agency's position. Participation in events does not endorse the organizers' position, nor their political affiliation.' During his remarks, Abu Hasna said Israel used October 7 as an excuse 'to liquidate UNRWA' and push the international community into ditching the aid group. Israel, he claimed, 'began to talk openly about the need to liquidate UNRWA' and spent more than $150 million on a supposed 'counter-media' initiative meant 'to distort the image of UNRWA.' 'If you type UNRWA in Google now, search engines direct you to something that resembles that this is a terrorist organization,' he lamented. An independent U.N. investigation determined that UNRWA employees did in fact participate in the October 7 attacks. The agency fired nine officials as a result. Abu Hasna during the briefing acknowledged this investigation but said only that 'some people may have participated.' Elsewhere in the briefing, Hamas official Al-Hajj advocated for sowing divisions between Europe and the Trump administration in a bid to keep international dollars flowing into UNRWA. The briefing was broadcast on Facebook and presented by the European Palestinian Media Center, a media outlet once helmed by Dutch activist Amin Abou Rashed. Dutch authorities arrested Rashed and his daughter in 2023 for allegedly raising millions of dollars for Hamas.

‘There are degrees of hell in hell’ – freed hostage’s parents spe...	Starved of food and companionship, Omer Shem Tov used his faith and mental toughness to survive Hamas captivity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Starved of food and companionship, Omer Shem Tov used his faith and emotional strength to survive Hamas captivity, his parents told Channel 13 in an interview Monday. Omer was kidnapped from the Nova dance festival during Hamas's October 7, 2023, invasion, along with two friends, Maya and Itay Regev. They remained together until the brother and sister were released in the first hostage deal, which occurred in late November that year. He didn’t see another friendly face for the next 13 months, and for a whopping 50 days, he was in complete isolation, his parents, Shelly and Malki, said. The terrorists put him in a very deep tunnel that was pitch dark and so low he couldn’t stand up, and so narrow he couldn’t stretch his arms out, they said. 'They gave him a flashlight and a just a tiny bit of food and sea water, and left him there,' Malki said. He had to ration himself, eating at first two pitot a day, then one, then a half, then just a cookie, because he didn't know how long he'd be there. 'Mom, I was so thin I could feel my bones,' Shelly recounted him telling her. Then the battery in the flashlight died, and for five days, he was 'in total, utter darkness,' Malki said. 'On the fifth day, he spoke to God,' Shelly said, 'praying, ‘Please, God, get me out of here, it doesn’t matter to where,’ and he said that two hours later his captor came.' The Hamas terrorists took him to a wider tunnel, one tiled with white tiles, which seemed like real light to him. 'Even in hell there seem to be degrees of hell,' his father remarked with a small chuckle. The Shem Tovs spoke about Omer’s faith and how it helped him. Once, when he saw a terrorist using his prayer beads, they said, 'Omer told him, ‘Come, I’ll teach you something else: ‘God was, is, and will always be king,’' a common line in Jewish prayer, said especially on the holidays. His captors also gave him a book on the weekly Torah readings that a Jewish soldier had left behind, 'which he’d like to return' now, the Shem Tovs said with a smile, as the man’s name was written on it. 'He also received Psalm 100,' Shelly said, 'which I would read all the time here&#8230; and he read this psalm in captivity every day.' 'It’s unbelievable,' she said, marveling at the coincidence. Omer also told his parents that he never showed fear to his captors, knowing that if he did, 'they would take advantage of it.' This included when IDF tanks rumbled right over his tunnel, shaking the ground, and he could even hear soldiers speaking in Hebrew – and his captors told him, his parents said, that if they got too close or attempted a rescue, 'they would shoot him in the head.' Shelly, who sat by Omer’s bedside the entire first night that he returned, not sleeping and just holding his hand and watching him breathe, said that the word 'joy' has a different meaning for her now. Instead of 'waking up in fear every morning&#8230; it’s opening your eyes and saying, ‘Wow. Wow,’' she recounted with a huge smile and sparkling eyes. Seeing him for the first time in 505 days and hugging him fiercely 'was really like giving birth to my child again,' she said.

Putin to broker nuclear talks with Iran – report	Russian president Vladimir Putin reportedly agrees to request by President Donald Trump to help facilitate talks with Tehran on Iran's nuclear program and support for terror groups. By World Israel News Staff Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to aid the Trump administration in bringing Tehran to the negotiating table on a number of key issues, including Iran's nuclear aspirations, according to a report Tuesday by Bloomberg. President Donald Trump reportedly requested that his Russian counterpart help facilitate talks between the U.S. and Iran, acting as an intermediary between the two countries. Trump is said to have proposed the arrangement during a call with Putin last month, while senior American officials reportedly raised the idea with Russian leaders in Saudi Arabia days after Trump's call to Putin. In particular, Trump requested that Putin help the U.S. initiate a dialogue with Tehran regarding the Iran nuclear program, a possible new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 agreement, as well as Iran's support for terrorist proxy groups across the Middle East including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Yemenite Houthis. The White House has not yet responded to the report. Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said Moscow supported talks between Iran and the U.S. and would be willing to help open a line of communication. 'Russia believes that the United States and Iran should resolve all problems through negotiations,' Peskov said, adding that Russia 'is ready to do everything in its power to achieve this.' On Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei neither confirmed nor denied that Russia had offered to broker talks with the U.S. 'Given the significance of these matters, it’s possible that many parties will show good will and readiness to help with various problems,' Baghaei said 'From this perspective, it’s natural that countries will present an offer of help if it’s needed.'

Israeli lawmakers urge repatriation of 100 children rescued from ...	Eligible for citizenship, they must be brought to Israel after the severe abuse they suffered at the hands of the Lev Tahor cult, MKs told. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Knesset Committee for Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs urged the government Monday to repatriate 100 of 160 children rescued in December from a Jewish cult in Guatemala who are seemingly eligible for Israeli citizenship. The other 60 are American and Canadian citizens. In the hearing, the MKs were told that the minors being held in various shelters in the Central American country, whose authorities raided the compound of the radical Lev Tahor sect after allegations of severe child abuse there prompted them to act. They will not be kept in the facilities much longer, however, and are in great danger of being returned to the cult if the Israeli government doesn’t act immediately, the aunt of four of the children told the Committee. 'The police in Guatemala did the hard work for the State of Israel, and now the government must complete the work and bring them to Israel,' said Orit Cohen Amir. 'If the Israeli government does not wake up, the children will return to experiencing mental, sexual and physical abuse.' Shas MK Yinon Azoulay agreed that the issue was urgent. 'The children in the cult are in danger of death,' he said, and the government must bring them to the country 'and ensur[e] they are in appropriate absorption frameworks.' This would need intense psychological treatment for the terrible sexual and physical traumas they have undergone, the MKs were told. The cult starves its members due to its twisted ideals of kashruth, it is 'forbidden to receive medical treatment,' cult survivor Amir Boyer attested, and 'there is no contact with the outside world.' It has been previously reported that Lev Tahor leaders have used even young girls in the group as their sex slaves, and Azoulay testified that 'within the cult there are children who are 13 years old who are already parents.' A legal representative of the families of those ensnared, Maya Nussbaum, said that if a rescue operation is not implemented, 'We fear that &#8230; the children will be smuggled to secret locations around the world as has been the case until now. The legal phase has already exhausted itself, now is the time for active actions to bring the survivors.' The children will have homes to go to, she noted, as 'We have submitted dozens of requests for guardianship to date.' MK Gilad Kariv, the Committee’s chairman, said that his group will be keeping a 'close' eye on the issue, as the State 'cannot remain indifferent' to the children who are residents of Israel and is 'obligated to work to return them to the country and provide them with protection - as we would do for any Israeli citizen who is in danger overseas.' In response, a representative of the Prime Minister's Office called it a 'complicated matter with many aspects and we are trying to understand all the details.' By contrast, an attorney from the Justice Ministry said, 'We have an excellent understanding of the international legal tools that need to be worked on &#8230; thanks to the Israeli delegation that went to Guatemala.' 'The children are currently not under the effective control of the cult, and this allows us to use legal tools to bring them to Israel,' Yaakov Friedberg said, while noting that 33 guardianship orders have been ordered to date. Foreign Ministry officials noted that the ministry is 'in constant contact' with the Guatemalan authorities on the issue and that 'the State of Israel's involvement in the return of the children is clear and unequivocal.' Kariv demanded to receive by next week a 'clear directive from the Prime Minister’s Office' on 'how it intends to act on the issue,' including timetables on the children’s return.

Pro-annexation Israeli minister heads to US ahead of expected Tru...	Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announces trip to the US this week – as date of expected Trump announcement on future of Judea and Samaria nears. By World Israel News Staff A right-wing Israeli government minister announced he is flying to the U.S. for a meeting with his American counterpart, amid speculation President Donald Trump is poised to make a major announcement on the future of Judea and Samaria. On Tuesday, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) announced that he has departed for the U.S., where he will meet with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. 'The purpose of the visit is to strengthen the economic cooperation between Israel and the United States, promote joint economic initiatives, and deepen the strategic alliance between the countries,' Smotrich tweeted. 'In addition, I will emphasize in my meetings Israel’s resolute stance in the fight against terror and the need for clear American backing for the continuation of our security operations in the war.' 'This visit constitutes another building block in strengthening the strategic and economic ties between Jerusalem and Washington, stemming from a shared commitment to the stability and security of Israel and the entire region.' Notably, the timing of Smotrich’s visit coincides with the timing of an announcement by the Trump administration on Judea and Samaria, and Israel’s plans to apply sovereignty over part or all of the area. On February 5th, in response to questions regarding the future of Judea and Samaria and Israeli plans to extend sovereignty over the area, Trump said his administration hasn’t taken a position on it yet,' adding that the White House will be 'making an announcement probably on that very specific topic over the next four weeks.' Wednesday marks four weeks to the day since Trump’s comments hinting at an announcement on the issue. Smotrich, a former right-wing activist who cofounded the watchdog group Regavim to monitor illegal Arab construction in Israel, Judea, and Samaria, is a long-time supporter of extending Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. The Israeli government shelved its plans to annex parts of Judea and Samaria in 2020, in order to facilitate the signing of the Abraham Accords. According to then-U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, Israel committed to suspend its annexation plans until after the 2024 presidential election.

IDF hits Assad assets in northwestern Syria	Syrian media outlets earlier on Thursday night reported that an Israeli strike had hit an 'air defense base' belonging to Assad’s former army. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israeli fighter jets attacked a military site of Syria’s former Assad regime near Qardaha in northwestern Syria on Monday night in response to 'recent developments in the area,' the Israel Defense Forces said. 'The IDF continues to monitor developments in the area and will act as necessary in order to defend the citizens of the State of Israel,' the military said, confirming earlier local reports. The attack targeted 'a military site where weapons belonging to the previous Syrian regime were stored,' the statement added. It did not specify which developments prompted the strike. Syrian media outlets earlier on Thursday night reported that an Israeli strike had hit an 'air defense base' belonging to Assad’s former army. Since the fall of the Iranian- and Russian-backed Assad regime on Dec. 8, Israel has taken up positions inside and beyond the Golan Heights buffer zone, including on the strategic Syrian side of Mount Hermon. The Israeli Air Force has conducted hundreds of strikes on former Assad military assets to prevent them from falling into the hands of hostile forces. In a series of strikes last week, Israeli jets hit military targets throughout Syria’s southern region, including 'command centers and multiple sites containing weapons,' over the course of several hours, according to the IDF. In an address to new officers at an IDF graduation ceremony last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the Sunni jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, whose leaders rule Syria following the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime in December, that Israel 'will not allow forces of HTS or the new Syrian army to enter the territory south of Damascus.' The IDF 'will remain in the Hermon sector and the buffer zone [in the Syrian Golan Heights] indefinitely to protect our communities and thwart any threat,' he said.

‘Pre-Oct. 7 situation in Lebanon is no more’	Maj. Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser and ex-head of the IDF’s Military Intelligence Research Department, described the changes to the situation in the north as 'historic.' By Yaakov Lappin, JNS The Israel Defense Forces has fundamentally reshaped its enforcement policy against Hezbollah’s activities in Lebanon, marking a significant departure from the pre-war status quo, an IDF official told JNS on Monday. 'The guiding principle today is, the situation we were in before Oct. 6, [2023], where Hezbollah could erect a tent on the border and we would think about it, is no more,' said the official. In addition to retaining for the foreseeable future five positions in Lebanese territory following its withdrawal from Southern Lebanon as part of the Nov. 27, 2024 ceasefire with Lebanon, Israel has been working steadily to enforce the truce. It is aided in this effort by the fact that the Lebanese terrorist group has been severely weakened by its year-long war with the Jewish state. In the final months of the war in the north, the IDF destroyed an enormous number of Hezbollah facilities and weapons, targeted its senior and intermediate command levels and killed more than 4,000 Hezbollah terror operatives. Israel also attacked Hezbollah’s financial system and strongholds across Lebanon. The Shi’ite terror organization has been struggling to recover ever since. Lebanon has taken steps to prevent Iranian funds from being smuggled into the country to Hezbollah, while the IDF has been demonstrating its ability and willingness to turn actionable intelligence into strikes. On Wednesday, Feb. 26, the Israeli Air Force eliminated Mahran Ali Nasser al-Din, a significant member of Hezbollah’s Unit 4400. The IDF described Unit 4400 as 'responsible for smuggling weapons into Lebanese territory from Iran and its proxies, aiming to maximize Hezbollah’s weapons stockpiles. Since its establishment, Unit 4400 has established numerous smuggling routes along the Syria-Lebanon border.' Al-Din played a major role in these operations. 'This activity, which facilitates Hezbollah’s armament, constitutes a clear threat to the security of the State of Israel and violates the understandings reached between Israel and Lebanon,' the IDF said. The next day, on Feb. 27, the IDF announced that it had identified activity inside a Hezbollah observation post in the area of Aainata in southern Lebanon, in violation of the ceasefire, which requires that Hezbollah withdraw north of the Litani River. The IAF proceeded to strike the post. That same day, the IAF eliminated Hezbollah terrorist Mohammed Mahdi Ali Shaheen near Hermel. Shaheen had been coordinating terrorist transactions for the purchase of weapons on the Syria-Lebanon border since the understandings between Lebanon and Israel came into effect,' according to the IDF. Shaheen was part of Hezbollah’s Geographical Unit, which according to the Israeli military is responsible for the Beqaa area and had recently been involved in transporting weapons from Syria to Lebanon. His actions posed a serious threat, according to the IDF. Maj. Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser and ex-head of the IDF’s Military Intelligence Research Department, described the changes to the situation in the north as 'historic.' 'The situation in the north is totally different than when it was in the beginning of the war,' he said on Sunday during a call with reporters organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. For such dramatic changes to occur in so short a time is 'very rare,' he added. Following the collapse of the Assad regime in December, he continued, Hezbollah’s strategic position has fundamentally changed. For the first time in its history it now finds itself without a land bridge from Iran via Syria to Lebanon, he said. According to Col. (res.) Barak Ben-Zur, a former IDF Military Intelligence officer and ex-head of a research unit at the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet), the collapse of the Syrian regime was a massive blow to Hezbollah’s main backer, Iran. 'The Assad family regime made a strategic decision, since the signing of the Israel-Egypt peace agreement, to seek another regional pillar to replace Egypt—this was Iran,' he told JNS on Monday. That Iran 'did not deliver' is the most important takeaway from the situation, according to Amidror. Ben-Zur explained how since the 1980s Iran had established a regional array, building up Hezbollah and entrenching itself in Syria. That effort included bases, 'tactical forces, intelligence-gathering capabilities on Israel and a command-and-control system,' he said. 'All of this ended with the rise of the Sunni government and the expulsion of Assad and his supporters' from Syria, he added. 'This has created a strategic opportunity that alters reality and allows Israel to deepen Hezbollah’s isolation after a series of operations weakened its capabilities,' he continued. He warned, however, that Israel has not yet developed a fully coordinated strategic policy to reach this goal. 'The Israeli defense establishment must dedicate a staff study to this issue, as strategic opportunities are time-sensitive and can close after a period,' he told JNS. 'Alongside such a maneuver, preventing a renewal of the Iranian front within Syria is no less important a goal, and perhaps, more so,' he said. 'At this stage, it is difficult to point to Israeli focus on this issue, and the building of a strategic plan designed to fulfill these objectives.'

US defense chief backs Israeli buffer zones in Syria, Lebanon	US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks with Israeli Defense Minister, backing Netanyahu government's call to eliminate Hamas rule in Gaza, prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration's defense chief spoke by phone with his Israel counterpart Monday night, discussing regional threats, including Iran's nuclear program, the future of the Gaza Strip, and the U.S.-Israel alliance. In a statement released overnight, Pentagon Press Secretary John Ullyot said that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) spoke about bilateral interests, regional developments and opportunities, and security assistance priorities during their call. 'The Secretary reaffirmed that the United States remains 100 percent committed to Israel's security and emphasized the unbreakable bond that exists between the United States and Israel,' Ullyot said. 'Both leaders agreed that Iran remains a threat to regional security and agreed to work together on this challenge.' Hours later, Defense Minister Katz tweeted a summary of their conversation, claiming that Hegseth endorsed Israel's goal of 'eliminating' Hamas rule in the Gaza Strip and the need to return all of the 59 remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza. 'Great conversation with SecDef Pete Hegseth. I thanked him for the Donald Trump administration’s support in expediting military aid to Israel and its unwavering commitment to Israel’s security.' 'We agreed: All hostages must be brought home, and Hamas rule in Gaza must be eliminated. Iran remains the greatest threat to regional security – we will work together to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons.' During their call, Hegseth also gave his backing for the IDF's ongoing counter-terror operation in Samaria, as well as the establishment of Israeli buffer zones inside southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan Heights. 'The defense minister briefed the defense secretary about IDF operations in Judea and Samaria against terror in refugee camps, and emphasized the importance of security zones in Lebanon and Syria, and thanked him for the backing,' the Defense Ministry said Monday.

'On the fifth day he spoke to God,' Shelly said, 'praying, ‘Please, God, get me out of here, it doesn’t matter to where,’ and he said that two hours later his captor came.' The Hamas terrorists took him to a wider tunnel, one tiled with white tiles, which seemed like real light to him. 'Even in hell there seem to be degrees of hell,' his father remarked with a small chuckle. The Shem Tovs spoke more about Omer’s faith and how it helped him. Once, when he saw a terrorist using his prayer beads, they said, 'Omer told him, ‘Come, I’ll teach you something else: ‘God was, is, and will always be king,’' a common line in Jewish prayer, said especially on the holidays. His captors also once gave him a book on the weekly Torah readings that a Jewish soldier had left behind, 'which he’d like to return' now, the Shem Tovs said with a smile, as the man’s name was written on it. 'He also received Psalm 100,' Shelly said, 'which I would read all the time here&#8230; and he read this psalm in captivity every day.' 'It’s unbelievable,' she said, marveling at the coincidence. Omer also told his parents that he never showed fear to his captors, knowing that if he did, 'they would take advantage of it.' This included when IDF tanks rumbled right over his tunnel, shaking the ground, and he could even hear soldiers speaking in Hebrew – and his captors told him, his parents said, that if they got too close or attempted a rescue, 'they would shoot him in the head.' Shelly, who said that she sat by Omer’s bedside the whole first night he returned, not sleeping, just holding his hand and watching him breathe, said that the word 'joy' has a different meaning for her now. Instead of 'waking up in fear every morning&#8230; it’s opening your eyes and saying, ‘Wow. Wow,’' she recounted with a huge smile and sparkling eyes. Seeing him for the first time in 505 days and hugging him fiercely 'was really like giving birth to my child again,' she said.

IDF soldier’s family reveals first photo in Hamas captivity	Soldier severely wounded and kidnapped on October 7th is still alive, according to recently released hostages. By World Israel News Staff The family of an IDF soldier abducted by Hamas published a photograph of him in captivity, along with a heartfelt plea for the continuation of the ceasefire and hostage deal. Matan Angrest, 21, was dragged unconscious from a tank by Hamas terrorists, during the attack on the Nahal Oz base on October 7th, 2023. Angrest sustained major injuries during the battle, and according to released hostages, he is severely wounded and has not received proper medical care. In the images published by Angrest's family, he is seen with a battered, bruised face and bloodied eye. According to the family, the images were taken at least six months after the terror onslaught. The photographs are screenshots from a Hamas propaganda video featuring Angrest, which the family has chosen not to release in full. The family added that released hostages have said he is suffering mistreatment and abuse due to his status as an IDF soldier. Despite his health condition, he was excluded from the first phase of the hostage release deal because he serving in the military when he was kidnapped. No male Israeli soldiers abducted on October 7th were released in the first phase of the truce. Angrest’s family also said he was 'undergoing hellish torments, torturous interrogations and is being held in inhumane conditions.' 'We heard from released hostages that our beloved son Matan is alive. It was incredibly emotional for us,' Angrest's father Hagai said during an appearance at Hostage's Square in mid-February. 'The time has come to bring him back, along with all the others,' he continued, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'advance the second phase of the deal immediately. We all saw the horrific images, scenes of a Holocaust in 2025, here in Israel. Bring Matan and the rest of the hostages home now. Their situation is dire, and it is time to bring them back.'

Hamas replaced by international coalition in Egypt’s plan for Gaz...	Egyptian 'day after' plan for Gaza missing critical details, such as how Hamas will be ousted from power. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror group will no longer govern the Gaza Strip, which will instead by run by an international coalition of Arab, Muslim, and Western countries, according to an Egyptian plan for the coastal enclave set to be unveiled on Tuesday. Egypt, which has staunchly refused President Donald Trump's request for the country to accept Gazan refugees, said it has drafted an alternative plan for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Strip. According to a Reuters report, the plan is missing numerous critical details that are necessary for its implementation. The plan does not specify how Hamas will be persuaded to step down, nor does it specify how the Strip will be governed without the terror group in control. 'There will be no major international funding for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza if Hamas remains the dominant and armed political element on the ground controlling local governance,' an introduction to the plan reads. The document also does not state who should pay for the reconstruction efforts in Gaza. The Arab League is expected to hold a special summit focused on the future of Gaza, with the meeting to be held in Egypt later on Tuesday. The summit was called after Trump said that the U.S. would encourage the emigration of Gazans from the territory, which would then come under American control during the rebuilding process. In a statement to Reuters, a senior Hamas official said that the terror group was not in contact with Egypt regarding the proposal. 'The day after in Gaza must only be decided by the Palestinians,' Sami Abu Zurhi said. 'Hamas rejects any attempt to impose projects or any form of non-Palestinian administration, or the presence of any foreign forces on the land of the Gaza Strip.' An anonymous Palestinian Authority official told Reuters that 'we agreed with the Egyptians on a committee made of Palestinian experts that will help the Palestinian Authority in running the Gaza Strip for six months. The committee is made of Palestinian experts and coordinates with the PA, and doesn't answer to non-Palestinian bodies.'

MK: ‘Haifa attacker was insane, no such thing as Druze terrorism’	Druze citizens of Israel are known for their loyalty to the state, with nearly all of the community's men serving in the military. By World Israel News Staff The Druze community is insisting that the perpetrator of a deadly stabbing attack, who hails from a Druze background, was mentally ill and not motivated by terror. Yitro Shahin, 20, fatally stabbed an elderly man and wounded four other people at Haifa's HaMifratz bus depot on Monday afternoon, with witnesses reporting that he screamed 'Allahu Akbar' before attacking. Shahin, who was born and raised in Germany but has family roots in the northern city of Shfar'am, was shot dead by security guards at the bus station. The Shahin family told Hebrew-language media outlets that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, has numerous family members who serve in the IDF, including an uncle who is a disabled veteran, and that he was not motivated by Islamic ideology. Druze citizens of Israel are known for their loyalty to the state, with nearly all of the community's men serving in the military. They have faced historic and ongoing persecution from Muslims throughout the Middle East. 'The attacker was recognized by the National Insurance Institute as a mentally ill person and received a disability stipend. He was hospitalized several times in a mental health facility,' MK Hamed Amar, a Druze member of the Yisrael Beitenu party, told Ynet. 'There is no Druze terrorist, there has never been a Druze terrorist, and there will never be a Druze terrorist,' he continued. 'Such an act of terrorism is contrary to every moral and human value and certainly does not reflect the loyal spirit of the Druze community in Israel, which is a full partner in defending the state and its values,' Amar said in a separate media statement. The victim of Shahin's attack was identified as Hassan Dahamshah, an Arab-Israeli from Kfar Kanna. Dahamshah's family told Ynet that Shahin's relatives had contacted them to ask for forgiveness. Dr. Ahmad Karim, the victim's nephew, said that the attacker should have been supervised more closely due to his mental issues. 'As a doctor, I can say that any person with [this level of] psychiatric illness should be in an appropriate setting, and not roaming around like this on a bus or train.' Karim added that the family was still in shock from the incident, and that 'it's not easy to accept [the killing of their relative] and move on.' However, Karim said, 'we accept [the Shahin family's] apology.'

Investigation reveals IDF failed to protect Kfar Aza residents	The military didn’t arrive at the kibbutz until nearly two hours after the invasion, during which time the local security squad displayed remarkable heroism in its defense against the terrorists. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An investigation into Hamas's invasion of Kfar Aza on October 7th revealed that the IDF failed to protect the kibbutz's residents, while the local security squad, which suffered heavy losses, fought valiantly. On October 7, 2023, at around 6:30 a.m., 250 terrorists from the Gaza City Brigade, armed with explosives and weapons, invaded Kfar Aza. They began killing residents, looting property, and taking hostages. Although 100 terrorists were neutralized inside the kibbutz and 50 just outside, Hamas still caused significant damage to the kibbutz, which will require extensive reconstruction. The military did not arrive at the kibbutz until nearly two hours after the invasion, during which time the local security squad displayed remarkable heroism in its defense against the attackers. The security squad, which also fought terrorists outside the kibbutz, suffered heavy losses. Among the Kfar Aza residents, 62 were murdered and 19 were kidnapped. Two of the hostages were accidentally killed by friendly fire, and two remain in Gaza. The investigation found that the military was unprepared for the attack and had no plans for dealing with a Hamas invasion. Not only did the military arrive late to the kibbutz, but they were also poorly equipped and lacked coordinated intelligence and a plan, leading to chaos. Additionally, the evacuation of residents was poorly organized and not executed safely. Although several airstrikes were conducted against Hamas terrorists, they had little to no effect. The investigation was carried out by the 55th Reserve Paratroopers Brigade, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Oded Ziman, and included interviews with kibbutz residents and members of the security squad. An internal IDF probe described Hamas's capture of the Nahal Oz base as 'the biggest failure' of October 7th. The investigation, shared with local media on Monday night, revealed that Nahal Oz, located just half a mile from the Gaza border, was meant to be a forward base but was instead treated as a rear outpost due to financial constraints. It was overrun in less than two hours.

Russia invites Israel to May 9 event; US, EU unwelcome	This year is a round anniversary since the German surrender to the Red Army 80 years ago. By Canaan Lidor, JNS Russia has invited Israel to attend its Victory Day commemorations in May alongside representatives of China, Brazil, Slovakia and Serbia—but not Germany, the United States or most European Union’s member states, Russian media reported Sunday. The annual May 9 commemorations on Red Square in Moscow feature a military parade and speeches by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in recognition of the sacrifices made by his country in its war against Germany in World War II. This year is a round anniversary since the German surrender to the Red Army 80 years ago. A national holiday, May 9 is a major patriotic holiday in Russia and throughout much of the post-Soviet world. The holiday’s main event is the Red Square parade. In contrast to past anniversaries this year, Russia did not invite the United States, most of the European Union, Canada, Australia and other countries it deems 'unfriendly,' according to News.ru. Western leaders have attended the event in the past, including in 2005 when Putin hosted U.S. President George W. Bush and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac. Israel’s then president Moshe Katsav represented it at that event. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last attended the parade in 2018 as one of the only Western leaders present. Israel’s Knesset designated May 9 the previous year as an official holiday. Israel is one of the only countries outside the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States where May 9 is on the official calendar. The day’s addition to the calendar was widely seen as a gesture to Russia but also as recognizing the thousands of Jewish Red Army war veterans living in Israel. Former U.S. president Barack Obama did not attend the 2015 parade, nor did his French counterpart François Hollande. Both leaders stayed away following Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine the previous year. Those countries, as well as Germany and Israel, were nonetheless represented at the 2015 event by their diplomatic corps. Compiled in 2021, the list of 'unfriendly nations' includes the United States, most E.U. member states, Canada and Australia. Russian media noted that this means that Germany would for the first time be absent from the anniversary event. Alexander Tolmachev, a lawmaker in Russia’s Duma, told News.ru on Sunday that Germany cannot be a welcome guest on Red Square 'when its tanks are burning again from Russian shells.' Tolmachev used the initials of the defunct Federal Republic of Germany, also known as West Germany, to refer to present-day Germany. He was referencing military aid given by Germany to Ukraine, including tanks. The United States has supplied weapons to Ukraine and imposed, along with other Western countries, biting sanctions on Russia. Like its Western allies, Israel has also condemned Russia’s invasion, but has not been vocal on the issue as some. When it invaded Ukraine, Russia had military bases in Syria, where it had helped prop up the regime of Bashar Assad until it collapsed in December. Israel has conducted military operations in Syria, mainly against Hezbollah and other terrorist groups, and has sought to avoid confrontations with Russia in Syria and beyond. Israel and Russia reportedly had worked out a procedure for coordinating Israeli military activity in Syria, until this mechanism was suspended following the military escalation that began on Oct. 7, 2023. Last month, Israel voted at the United Nations along with the United States, Russia and Hungary, as well as about a dozen countries in the developing world, against a nonbinding General Assembly resolution condemning Russia as the aggressor in the ongoing war in Ukraine. Almost all other European Union countries voted in favor. U.S. President Donald Trump has outlined a shift in Washington’s policy on Ukraine, from unconditional aid in the war with Russia to an off-ramp toward a negotiated end to the conflict. A spokesperson for Israel’s foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a JNS query regarding who will represent Israel at this year’s event. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, was also invited and plans to attend, according to News.ru.

Internal IDF probe: Battle for Nahal Oz base ‘biggest failure’ of...	The probe also highlighted the heroism of the soldiers who risked their lives to fend off the attack. By JNS Staff A probe by the Israel Defense Forces into the capture of its Nahal Oz military base by Hamas and Palestinian terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, which was made public on Monday, described the ability to defend the border outpost as 'the biggest failure' that day. At the same time, it highlighted the heroism of the soldiers who risked their lives to fend off the attack. The investigation, which was shared with local media on Monday night, revealed that Nahal Oz, just half a mile from the Gaza border, was supposed to be a forward base but was treated as a rear outpost amid financial constraints. It was overrun in just under two hours. As the terrorists launched their assault at 6:29 a.m. on Oct. 7, 162 soldiers were stationed at Nahal Oz—only 90 of them armed. Of the 90, 81 were trained as combat soldiers. The probe noted that Nahal Oz’s perimeter was secured by a single guard, plus three other guards stationed inside the outpost to prevent the theft of weapons, adding that the battle for control was decided within minutes. Some 215 terrorists from Hamas’s Shejaiya Battalion led the assault, according to the probe. They managed to kill 53 soldiers, in addition to kidnapping three troops and seven female IDF observers. The IDF fighters deployed to Nahal Oz, working in cooperation with the Israeli Air Force, managed to eliminate 71 terrorists during the firefight. By analyzing hundreds of social-media posts from IDF soldiers at Nahal Oz, Hamas managed to create an accurate map of the base and knew where soldiers slept, as well as the location of shelters, communication equipment, surveillance cameras and the war room. 'The best time to attack the outpost is first light. The recommended day of attack—the weekend and on Jewish holidays when some soldiers are at home on leave,' a seized Hamas file read. 'The recommendation: high-trajectory [rocket] fire that will bring the soldiers into shelters.' The probe highlighted the bravery of Golani company commander Maj. Shilo Har-Even, 25, who despite being seriously wounded led counter-attacks against terrorists at Nahal Oz until he was killed in battle. Hamas also faced fierce resistance from IDF Warrant Officer Ibrahim Kharuba, 39, a Bedouin soldier who fought to protect the defenseless female observers. During the battle, Kharuba was said to have told the lookouts that it would be an honor to die protecting them and the Jewish state. A devout Muslim, he was killed in a shootout. Following the probe, Har-Even and Kharuba were both recommended for the Medal of Valor, the Jewish nation’s highest military decoration. The probe, which concludes that the army failed to prepare for a large-scale ground invasion, in particular under rocket fire, was presented to Defense Minister Israel Katz by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. On Thursday, the IDF presented the findings of its wide-ranging internal probes into the failures leading up to and during the Hamas-led attacks, and the resulting massacre of 1,200 people in Israel’s south on Oct. 7. 'The State of Israel chose a policy of ‘conflict management’ vis-à-vis Hamas, whose purpose is to preserve and improve the existing reality, and from which the military methods of operation were derived,' the IDF charged in the probes, which were geared to draw operational lessons and not take aim at decisions by the political echelons. In total, 5,500 terrorists infiltrated Israel through 114 breaches in the border, and also used seven vessels and six paragliders, according to the IDF’s findings. The Hamas-led terrorists were said to have breached the security barrier under the cover of at least 3,889 rockets and 57 drones. The military now understands that the terror organization had gradually prepared plans to 'break the defense of the Gaza Division' since 2016. Yet when the Military Intelligence Directorate obtained Hamas’s plans, dubbed 'Jericho Wall,' in 2022, they were dismissed as unrealistic. 'The responsibility is mine. I was the commander of the army on Oct. 7, and I also bear the full responsibility for all of you,' stated Halevi, who has taken the blame for the military’s failures and plans to resign in March, in remarks published by the IDF on Thursday evening.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During a Knesset plenum debate, MK Chili Tropper read aloud from a letter that freed hostage Yarden Bibas had addressed to Netanyahu. Bibas, along with his wife Shiri and their two children, Ariel (4) and Kfir (9 months), were kidnapped by Hamas from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th. Yarden Bibas, the sole survivor of the family, was released before the bodies of his wife and children were returned to Israel. The letter began, 'Mr. Prime Minister, my name is Yarden Bibas. As you listen to this speech, I am sitting shiva for my wife, Shiri, and my children, Kfir and Ariel—innocent, pure souls who were kidnapped from our home and murdered while in captivity. They could and should have been saved.' Bibas pointed out that on the morning of October 7th, 'The state was not in Nir Oz,' and instead, the kibbutz had to rely on local heroes to defend the community against the Hamas onslaught. 'Today, 514 days later, I return from Gaza to face an unimaginable reality: I had to bury my entire family in a single day. I wouldn’t wish this horrific nightmare on anyone. Despite the overwhelming pain, I ask you, in this moment, to hold back. The time for revenge has not yet arrived.' 'At this stage,' Bibas wrote, 'We are obligated to immediately bring back our brothers.' Bibas also mentioned his friends David Cunio and his brother Ariel, whom he befriended at a young age, and who are now being held captive by Hamas. Bibas declared that the hostages should be freed before any strategy to eliminate Hamas is implemented. 'Once we bring David and all the hostages home, I will be the first to support any action to dismantle Hamas. As a resident of Nir Oz, I understand that we must defeat Hamas because, without doing so, we will never have security. But we must always honor the sanctity of life, respect the dignity of the dead, and ensure no one is left behind—because without these principles, we lose our very essence.' The letter also called for a state commission of inquiry into the causes of the October 7th invasion. 'So many civilians are asking for forgiveness, yet so few politicians are doing the same. So many civilians and soldiers are taking responsibility, while so few government officials are,' Bibas wrote.

Katz: 'We will resume fighting, and they will face the IDF with force and methods they have never encountered before—until we achieve complete victory.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a stark warning to Hamas, stating that they would face 'the gates of hell' if they refuse to release the remaining hostages. At an event commemorating the 33rd anniversary of Menachem Begin's passing, Katz said, 'In recent days, with a heavy heart, we have recovered the remains of eight additional captives who were murdered by Hamas in Gaza.' Katz reaffirmed the government's commitment to bringing home all remaining hostages, both living and deceased. 'The ceasefire agreement with Hamas and the heavy toll Israel has endured — and is willing to continue paying — was aimed at securing the swift release of all living Israeli hostages and returning the remains of those who have passed. This is our moral obligation and ultimate objective. In these critical days, we are working tirelessly to achieve this goal.' However, with Hamas rejecting the hostage release proposal put forward by U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, the terror group has created an impasse in negotiations. Despite this, Katz indicated there would be a few more days of negotiations in an attempt to revive the deal, but he emphasized that Israel would send no humanitarian aid into Gaza, fearing it would be stolen by Hamas. 'Despite ongoing violations by Hamas and its rejection of the proposal from President Trump's Special Envoy for the Middle East, Steven Witkoff, we have agreed to the mediators' request for additional negotiation time. In the meantime, we have halted all humanitarian aid to Gaza,' he stated. Katz warned, 'Make no mistake, Hamas — this is just the beginning. If Hamas does not release the hostages soon, the gates of Gaza will close, and the gates of hell will open.' 'We will resume fighting, and they will face the IDF with force and tactics unlike anything they have encountered before — until we achieve complete victory. We will never allow Hamas to rule Gaza. This conflict will end with two clear outcomes: the release of all our hostages and the total defeat of Hamas' rule in Gaza,' he declared.

Iranian VP resigns as regime rejects US talks	The Leader Khamenei said that we will not talk to the United States, and I announce that we will not talk to the United States. It is over,' Pezeshkian declared. By Jewish Breaking News The Iranian rial has collapsed to historic lows, hovering above 920,000 against the US dollar. Oil tankers drift aimlessly at sea, unable to deliver their cargo. Frozen assets remain locked away in foreign banks. This is the reality of Iran under what Donald Trump dubbed his 'maximum pressure' campaign – a strategy now continuing into Trump’s second term that has pushed the Islamic Republic’s economy to the brink. 'We are in a full-scale war with the enemy, and they are imposing economic pressure on us. The situation today is worse than the eight-year war with Iraq,' President Masoud Pezeshkian told parliament on Sunday. 'With Trump’s signature, the country’s oil tankers and gas ships are left adrift, wondering how to get the energy to its destination.' The Iranian president also pointed to financial challenges caused by the non-repayment of debts by several countries. '$6bn,' he noted bluntly. 'Qatar will not return $6bn, and Iraq and Turkey are not paying back their debts either.' Frozen in South Korean banks due to US sanctions and later transferred to accounts in Doha as part of a 2023 prisoner swap deal, the funds remain inaccessible following what state-run ISNA reports describe as a 'quiet understanding' between Washington and Qatar. Still, Iran is refusing to bend to American demands for negotiations. 'The Leader Khamenei said that we will not talk to the United States, and I announce that we will not talk to the United States. It is over,' Pezeshkian declared. 'I believe in dialogue and will remain so, but what the Leader has determined regarding negotiations with the United States, we will stand on this position until the end and will not act on anything else.' Meanwhile, Iranian Vice President Mohammad Javad Zarif has announced his resignation. Though ISNA insists his resignation bears no relation to leaderships refusal to engage with Washington, political observers note that Zarif, who previously crafted the 2015 nuclear agreement, likely joined Pezeshkian’s government with hopes of reviving diplomatic channels.

40% of Israelis fear Trump could abandon Israel	More than half of right-wing Israelis believe such a scenario is unlikely, though approximately one-third consider it a real possibility. By TPS A significant number of Israelis fear that there is a high possibility of US President Donald Trump abandoning Israel if Jerusalem’s policies don’t align with US interests, according to a survey released on Monday. The survey, commissioned by The Israeli Democracy Institute, comes on the heels of a heated exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday. The Jerusalem-based research center Israel Democracy Institute asked Israelis what the likelihood is that President Trump would turn his back on Israel if he perceives its policies aren’t in line with Washington. Approximately half of the Israeli public believes such a scenario is either quite unlikely or very unlikely, the survey found. However, a significant portion — around 40% — worries that the possibility of Trump and Israel having a falling out is either quite high or very high. 'President Trump is unpredictable,' Prof. Eyal Zisser, Chair of The Department for Middle Eastern and African History of the Tel Aviv University, told The Press Service of Israel. 'Israel is slightly different from Ukraine, because we have the support of the Republican Party and because Israel is the strategic ally of the US. But if Israel irritates Trump, he can as well turn his back to us as he did to Ukraine.' The survey revealed notable differences across demographic groups. Among Jewish Israelis, 41% believe there is a high chance of an American pivot away from Israel, compared to 30% among Arab Israelis. Political affiliation shows even starker contrasts. More than half of left-wing Israelis believe there’s a high or very high chance Trump would withdraw support, while only about one-third think this is unlikely. Conversely, more than half of right-wing Israelis believe such a scenario is unlikely, though approximately one-third consider it a real possibility. Centrists remain divided on the issue. The February 2025 Israeli Voice Index, conducted by the Viterbi Center at the Israel Democracy Institute, surveyed 759 Israeli adults online and by phone from February 25-28, before Zelensky’s Oval Office meeting. The results had a margin of error of 3.5%. Zelensky was expected to sign a minerals agreement with the US. Instead, in front of live cameras, Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance argued with Zelensky over Russia’s commitment to resolving the war through diplomacy.

Argentine President Milei to visit Israel this month	The South American leader has broken with decades of Argentinian foreign policy tradition by firmly siding with Israel since taking office over a year ago, propelling relations between the two nations to unprecedented heights. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS Argentinian President Javier Milei is scheduled to visit Israel later this month in his second visit to the country in as many years. The March 23 visit, which is to include a landmark address to the Knesset, comes as the Argentinian leader has emerged as one of Israel’s most vocal supporters, firmly aligning himself with both Jerusalem and Washington. Milei is also expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to Israeli officials. The planned trip follows an invitation to formally address the Israeli parliament extended to Milei last month by Knesset Speaker Amir Ohama. The South American leader has broken with decades of Argentinian foreign policy tradition by firmly siding with Israel since taking office over a year ago, propelling relations between the two nations to unprecedented heights. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were first established 75 years ago. Last year, in one of his first official trips as president, Milei paid a wartime solidarity visit to Israel, where he reiterated his pledge to move his country’s embassy to Jerusalem. An iconoclast and political outsider, Milei was elected in November 2023 amid a burgeoning economic crisis and skyrocketing inflation that has long beleaguered the large South American country, which is making major strides toward recovery under his leadership. A week after his election victory, he visited the United States for government meetings, stopping at the grave in New York of the late Lubavitcher Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. It was his third such visit that year. Since taking office, he has listed Hamas as a terrorist organization and called out Iran’s terrorism, vowing to try in absentia Iranian suspects in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires. Last month, Milei declared two days of national mourning for the Bibas children, Ariel, 4, and nine-month-old baby Kfir, who were murdered in captivity by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, along with their mother Shiri. The family, which held Israeli, Argentine and German citizenship, had become symbols of the plight of the 250 hostages abducted by Hamas during the terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre.

By Joshua Marks, JNS Itzik Elgarat, who was murdered while in Hamas captivity in Gaza and whose body was returned to Israel last week, was laid to rest at Kibbutz Nir Oz on Monday. As the funeral procession set out from Rishon LeZion toward Nir Oz, Itzik’s brother Dani recited the Kaddish. Along the route to the kibbutz, thousands stood with Israeli flags to pay their respects. The funeral in Nir Oz was also attended by thousands. Eulogies were delivered by his brother Dani, his sister Rachel Danzig—who survived the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre—his nephews Amit, Tor and Mor, his niece Reut Goldstein, and The Democrats chairman Yair Golan. Elgarat, 69, was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7. He was on the phone with his brother Dani when he was taken captive. He is survived by his two children.

UN’s nuclear watchdog warns Iran has enough enriched uranium for ...	Iran's nuclear program has dramatically expanded the country's stockpile of 60% enriched uranium, International Atomic Energy Agency warns, with enough fissile material to produce six nuclear warheads. By World Israel News Staff The United Nations' nuclear watchdog body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has reported a significant increase in Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, raising concerns about the country's potential to develop nuclear weapons. According to IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi, Iran’s 60% enriched uranium reserves have reached 275 kilograms—an increase of approximately one nuclear weapon’s worth per month since last December. The latest report, presented to the IAEA Board of Governors on Monday, underscores the acceleration of Tehran’s nuclear program since President Donald Trump's election victory. The agency has determined that Iran now possesses enough 60% enriched uranium that, if further refined to 90% weapons-grade level, could produce at least six nuclear weapons. This calculation does not include the country’s additional stockpiles of 20% and lower-enriched uranium, which could further expand its nuclear capabilities. Israeli and some U.S. intelligence estimates suggest that Iran could potentially develop an even larger number of nuclear weapons than the IAEA projects, particularly if Tehran opts for smaller warhead designs. These concerns have been amplified by Iran’s acceleration of uranium enrichment, which reportedly spiked in response to the IAEA Board’s condemnation of its nuclear violations in November 2024. The alarming revelations come amid political upheaval in Tehran, as Iranian leadership on Sunday forced out Vice President Javad Zarif, one of the government’s key figures advocating for diplomacy with the West. Zarif's departure raises further questions about Iran’s willingness to engage in nuclear negotiations or de-escalate tensions with the international community. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has expanded sanctions against Iran, as part of its policy of 'maximum pressure,' to force Tehran to either abandon its atomic aspirations or to return to the negotiating table to reach a deal to replace the 2015 nuclear agreement.

Russia accuses Zelensky of being ‘traitor to Jews,’ and a ‘pure N...	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterates claim that Ukraine's Jewish president is a 'pure Nazi,' calling him a 'traitor to the Jewish people' while defending Russia's invasion. By World Israel News Staff Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Ukraine's Jewish president of being a 'pure Nazi' who betrayed 'the Jewish people,' referencing the Putin government's past accusations of Nazism by Kyiv. Speaking with the Russian defense ministry's official media outlet Krasnaya Zvezda, Lavrov said over the weekend that Volodymyr Zelensky is 'nazifying' Ukraine, justifying Russia's February 2022 invasion of its neighbor and the continuing war between the two countries. 'Zelensky has turned 180 degrees from a man who came to power on slogans of peace, on slogans of ‘leave the Russian language alone, it is our common language, our common culture,'' Lavrov said. 'And in six months he has turned into a pure Nazi and, as Russian President Putin correctly said, into a traitor to the Jewish people.' The comments came after President Donald Trump ordered Zelensky out of the White House following a stormy televised meeting between the two leaders, as Trump attempted to win Zelensky's support for a deal trading American aid for mineral development rights in Ukraine. The Trump administration has pushed Zelensky's government to accept a ceasefire with Russia that does not mandate a full withdrawal to the pre-war borders. As part of the deal, Trump has offered to provide additional U.S. aid to Ukraine, with Kyiv granting the U.S. rights to extract mineral deposits in the Eastern European country - a move supporters say would tacitly ensure American support of Ukraine's current borders. Zelensky has rejected the plan, demanding America press Russia for a full withdrawal. Kyiv also criticized the mineral development proposal, saying its terms are overly favorable for the U.S. During his interview over the weekend, Lavrov warned that Russia would not accept a prolonged European military presence in Ukraine, including under a peacekeeping mandate. 'Just as [the Ukrainian government] was brought to power on bayonets and pushed forward, they now want to prop them up with their bayonets in the form of peacekeeping units. But this will mean that the root causes [of the war] will not disappear.' 'When we ask these thinkers what will hypothetically happen to the part they take under control, they respond that nothing will change – it will remain Ukraine. I asked one person: will the Russian language be banned there? He said nothing. They cannot utter words of condemnation for what has happened.'

Netanyahu apologizes to freed hostage: ‘I regret it took so long’	Israeli Prime Minister consoles freed hostage who lost his wife, daughters, and brother to Hamas terrorism, laments his lengthy captivity in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with former Gaza hostage Eli Sharabi Sunday evening, offering his condolences to the bereaved father and husband, while also lamenting his 16 months in captivity. 'I welcome your return home. I know that you are enduring difficult days. My wife and I would like to console you on your terrible loss – of Lianne, Noiya and Yahel, and your brother Yossi,' Netanyahu said. Sharabi's wife, Lianne, and the couple's two daughters were murdered by Hamas terrorists during the invasion of October 7th, 2023. While Eli and his brother Yossi were both taken hostage, Yossi died in captivity in the Gaza Strip. 'I understand the magnitude of the loss; this is awful,' Netanyahu continued, apologizing for the time it took to bring Sharabi back to Israel. 'I want you to know that I regret that it took us such a long time. We fought hard to get you out; your brother and the entire family fought hard. Sharon was in close contact with me the entire time,' Netanyahu said of Sharabi's other brother. 'I tried to speak with you about 10 days ago and I am pleased that it is happening now. I greatly appreciate the bravery with which you have told about what you endured, and it is very important that you also tell this to President Trump,' Netanyahu continued, referencing President Donald Trump's invitation to the 53-year-old former hostage. On Sunday, Sharon Sharabi revealed that Eli and a number of other freed hostages are slated to travel to Washington D.C. on Tuesday to meet with Trump. 'I wish you a successful trip, and when you return, I would be pleased for us to meet, when it is possible. We embrace you will all our hearts,' Netanyahu added. Sharabi thanked Netanyahu for the call, while emphasizing the need to bring the remaining hostages home as soon as possible. 'I thank you for your efforts in this direction. Sharon and I will make our efforts with President Trump, and maybe with our joint efforts we will bring this saga to a close.'

NY bill to outlaw display of Hamas, Hezbollah flags	If it passes, those who wave flags of Hezbollah or Hamas at protests could go to jail for up to four years. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Two Democrats are presenting this week a bill to the New York State assembly that would outlaw the display of terrorist flags, slapping wrongdoers with a punishment of up to four years in prison, The New York Post reported Sunday. Called the Stand Against Flags of Enemy Terrorists Act, it was authored by State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblyman Micah Lasher. It would amend the classification of what is considered aggravated harassment in the first degree to include instances when a person displays a symbol of a foreign terrorist organization with the intent to harass, annoy, threaten or another person. There are some symbols that 'cross the line' from free speech to fomenting hate, Lasher told the daily, 'and the emblems of mass-murdering terrorist organizations certainly belong in that category.' Flags of Hezbollah, Hamas, and other Middle East terror groups would join the Nazi swastika, and KKK symbols of flaming crosses and nooses as emblems that cannot be brandished about in public. Anti-Israel activists have often flown Hamas flags at the myriad protests they have held throughout New York City since the Gazan terror organization led an assault on Israel on October 7, 2023 in which they massacred 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, sparking the war that lasted 15 months before a tenuous ceasefire began in January. Protesters have also worn Hezbollah headbands and displayed pictures of terror leaders assassinated by Israel such as Hamas political head Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah as they marched and chanted slogans calling for Israel’s destruction, such as 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.' Hoylman-Sigal, who represents a large portion of the West Side of Manhattan, home to thousands of Jews, condemned the incidents as antisemitic. 'Since the October 7th terror attack in Israel, we’ve witnessed a disturbing rise in antisemitic instances here at home, including using symbols and flags of terrorist organizations to harass and intimidate Jewish New Yorkers at their synagogues, businesses and homes, simply because they’re Jewish,' he said in a statement, adding that 'no one should be allowed' to do so. Eric Goldstein, CEO of the UJA-Federation of New York, applauded the move. 'No one should have to face intimidation or the feeling that they are unsafe because of their Jewish identity,' he said. 'The S.A.F.E.T.Y. Act is a necessary and sensible measure to prevent the use of terrorist symbols as a tool of hate and intimidation.' Last summer, a poll by the New York Solidarity Network found that 44% of Jewish respondents said they personally felt unsafe as Jews in New York City, and 67% of Orthodox and identifiably Jewish respondents said they felt unsafe. This accorded with local police statistics, which showed that in the first half of 2024, a whopping 200 of 329 hate crimes targeted Jews.

Israel pushes to keep Russian bases in Syria as Turkish threat gr...	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has previously called for an alliance of Islamic countries in Syria against what he described as Israel’s 'expansionist policies.' By Jewish Breaking News Turkey’s ever-growing influence in post-Assad Syria has Israel nervous, with Israeli officials now lobbying Washington to maintain Russian military bases as a counterweight. At the heart of Israel’s anxiety is the rise of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group now leading Syria’s new government. HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has attempted to present himself as a moderate, promising inclusive governance and even promising to leave Israel one. 'We don’t want conflict either with Israel or with other countries. Syria won’t be used to target other countries. Syrians are tired and just need to live in peace,' al-Sharaa told foreign journalists in December. 'Our first concern is to get people to return home, whether from abroad or displaced people in Syria. We need to secure this transitional period, while providing the necessary assistance for the return of displaced persons, refugees and Syrians in general.' But Israel remains unconvinced, viewing HTS assurances with deep skepticism. Furthermore, Israeli officials believe that Turkey is supporting Iran’s efforts to rebuild Hezbollah and fear that it wishes to open an entirely new hostile front. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has previously called for an alliance of Islamic countries in Syria against what he described as Israel’s 'expansionist policies.' According to Reuters, Israeli intelligence presented American officials with a 'white paper' in February documenting Turkey’s covert activities in Syria. At this meeting, Israel advocated for maintaining Russia’s strategic military presence in Tartus and airbase in Latakia, arguing this would provide Moscow with substantial regional influence. Whether the current US administration will be receptive to Israel’s position remains to be seen. Some analysts believe President Trump, with his unique relationship with dictator Vladimir Putin, might be more open to allowing Russian bases to remain in Syria as part of a broader regional strategy.

Netanyahu’s office: Intelligence officer didn’t pass on alert to ...	An internal military probe into the hours leading up to the massacre published on Thursday revealed that the first signs of an impending invasion were detected around 9 p.m., some nine-and-a-half hours before Hamas and Palestinian Arabs breached the border fence. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office acknowledged over the weekend that the intelligence officers of six key leaders, including the premier, were alerted some three hours before the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. The intelligence officers received the Israel Defense Forces’ alert along with a note that Hamas was operating as usual and that the military’s Southern Command would discuss the issue in the morning, said the Prime Minister’s Office, adding that Netanyahu’s officer forwarded the message to the PMO military secretary, Maj. Gen. Avi Gil, but decided not to wake up the premier as the missive did not convey urgency. Netanyahu 'has full confidence in the military secretariat of his office,' his office emphasized in the statement, which came in response to a Channel 12 News report that seemed to shift blame onto the intelligence officer. Saturday’s Channel 12 report cited outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi as saying that the military did not publicize the claim that the PMO had been alerted to Hamas’s suspicious activities ahead of time 'even though this could have helped us in the face of the bad things that are being said about us. 'If the prime minister’s intelligence officer was a person of integrity, he should already have told him [Netanyahu] that he knew about [Hamas’s preparations on the eve of the attack] and did not update [Netanyahu]. He [the officer] did not do this,' Halevi added, according to the report. An internal military probe into the hours leading up to the massacre published on Thursday revealed that the first signs of an impending invasion were detected around 9 p.m., some nine-and-a-half hours before Hamas and Palestinian Arabs breached the border fence. Warning signs included preparations for rocket fire, operatives entering tunnels and the activation of dozens of Israeli SIM cards inside the Strip. The offices of Netanyahu and then-Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant were informed of the developments during the night; however, political officials were not woken up by their military secretaries. After the attack was launched at 6:29 a.m. the next day—the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah—some 5,500 terrorists infiltrated Israeli territory through 114 breaches in the security fence, and using seven vessels and six paragliders, according to the IDF’s findings. The Hamas-led terrorists were said to have breached the border under the cover of 3,889 rockets and 57 drones. The military now understands that Hamas had prepared plans to 'break the defense of the Gaza Division' since 2016. Yet when the Military Intelligence Directorate obtained Hamas’s attack plans, dubbed 'Jericho Wall,' in 2022, they were dismissed as unrealistic. Halevi was not informed of the 'Jericho Wall' plan and only heard about it some two weeks into the war, the IDF investigation claimed.

‘Sad moment for cinema’ – Israel rips Academy Award for documenta...	The movie, about Israeli demolitions in illegal Palestinian villages, 'distort Israel’s image in the world,' he wrote. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Culture and Sport Minister Miki Zohar slammed the Oscar award given Sunday to a joint Israeli-Palestinian documentary that casts Israel in a 'distorted' negative light. 'The Oscar win for the film ‘No Other Country’ is a sad moment for the world of cinema – instead of presenting the complexity of our reality, the filmmakers chose to echo narratives that distort Israel’s image in the world,' Zohar posted to X. 'Freedom of expression is an important value, but turning the slander of Israel into a tool for international promotion is not creativity – it is sabotage of the State of Israel, and after the massacre of October 7 and the ongoing war, it doubly hurts,' he added. In his acceptance speech, the movie’s chief protagonist, Basel Adra, called Israel’s actions 'ethnic cleansing,' and said that he hoped that his newborn daughter 'will not have to live the same life I'm living now, always fearing settlers, violence, home demolitions and forcible displacements. We call on the world to take serious actions to stop the injustice.' His Israeli film-partner, Yuval Abraham, appealed to the American government to stop helping to 'block' what he called 'a different path, a political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people.' He also told the audience that 'the terrible destruction of Gaza must end, the Israeli hostages who were taken in the crimes of October 7th must be released.' Abraham had been condemned in Israel when in acceptance speeches at previous awards ceremonies, he spoke about Gaza being devastated while not even mentioning the fact that Hamas had taken 251 hostages during its October 7, 2023 invasion of Israel, 62 of whom are still in captivity, although more than half are known to be dead. The film describes the efforts of Palestinian and Israeli activists to stop repeated demolitions of homes and evictions from the South Hebron Hills Masafer Yatta group of Palestinian villages that are located in an official IDF firing zone, and thus a closed military site. The villagers have appealed several times to Israel’s highest court since 1999, when the government first issued eviction orders to Masafer Yatta residents. In 2022, the High Court of Justice ruled that there were no legal barriers to expelling the residents in order to enable military training. Since then, the Civil Administration has occasionally sent in bulldozers and men to demolish a few houses or other structures, confiscate vehicles and equipment, and issue 'stop work' orders to block expansion of the villages, which receive no permits to build due to their illegal status. International pressure has successfully prevented any wholesale destruction of the 13 tiny communities. Only two have been taken down so far, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which noted in 2022 there were a total of 215 Palestinian households in the area, with about 1,150 people in all. Unlike many films made in Israel, the documentary received no government support due to its negative portrayal of the country, and officially it is labeled a Palestinian-Norwegian film. The award for Best Documentary Film was reportedly going to be presented by Israeli actress Gal Gadot but ultimately it was presented by Samuel L. Jackson and Selena Gomez.

Israeli scientists identify two types of heart scars, paving the ...	By Pesach Benson, TPS Challenging conventional medical wisdom, Israeli scientists found that scar tissue formation in the heart occurs through two distinct mechanisms — a discovery that could lead to new and more targeted therapeutic approaches for heart disease. The findings of what the Weizmann Institute researchers describe as 'hot fibrosis' and 'cold fibrosis' were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, Cell Systems. The research began as an unexpected collaboration between two scientists at the Weizmann Institute. Prof. Eldad Tzahor, an expert in heart disease, learned about a mathematical model developed by his neighbor, Prof. Uri Alon. That model, initially designed to classify scar tissue in various organs, suggested that fibrosis could be categorized based on interactions between just two cell types: fibroblasts, which produce collagen and provide tissue structure, and macrophages, immune cells involved in tissue repair and inflammation. 'At first, it sounded too simplistic to me,' admitted Tzahor. 'Biological systems are incredibly complex, but the idea intrigued me. It was a great opportunity to collaborate with Uri, so I proposed we test the model on heart disease.' Scar tissue forms in the heart when muscle cells are damaged, often due to heart attacks. While this scar tissue helps maintain the organ’s structural integrity, it does not contract effectively, leading to impaired heart function over time. Since there is currently no effective treatment to eliminate or reverse heart fibrosis, medical efforts focus on prevention and minimizing scar formation. The first mechanism, 'hot fibrosis,' involves active interactions between myofibroblasts and macrophages. Because macrophages are immune system cells often linked to inflammation and fever, this type of fibrosis was named 'hot.' The second mechanism, 'cold fibrosis,' is independent of macrophages; instead, myofibroblasts sustain the fibrosis process autonomously by secreting molecules that perpetuate scar formation. 'In medical textbooks, microscopic images of heart scars appear uniform, leading to the assumption that all fibrosis in the heart follows the same biological pathway,' explained Shoval Miyara, a joint doctoral student of Professors Tzahor and Alon and one of the research leaders. 'Our findings challenge that notion and show that these are, actually, two different diseases requiring different treatments,' she added. Using real human heart tissue samples, the research team confirmed the model’s predictions. The findings are particularly significant given the staggering number of heart cells affected by fibrosis. The left ventricle of the human heart contains roughly four billion muscle cells. During a heart attack around one billion — or 25 percent — die. Understanding how scars form and how they can be treated more precisely may improve long-term survival and quality of life for millions of patients worldwide. 'If we can identify whether a patient has hot or cold fibrosis, we could tailor treatments to target the specific process involved,' said Tzahor. 'This could lead to more effective therapies and better outcomes for people with heart disease.' The practical applications of this discovery could significantly impact cardiology and fibrosis treatment across various medical fields. Understanding whether a patient has 'hot fibrosis' or 'cold fibrosis' could allow doctors to prescribe tailored treatments that specifically address the underlying biological mechanism. For example, drug companies may one day develop anti-inflammatory or immune-modulating therapies for hot fibrosis and drugs that block fibroblast self-sustaining signals for cold fibrosis. The research could open new avenues for diagnostic tools that differentiate between the two fibrosis types. Since fibrosis is a major factor in lung (pulmonary fibrosis), kidney, and liver diseases (cirrhosis), researchers may examine whether these organs also develop hot and cold fibrosis. The study hinted that a similar classification could apply to scars that form after a stroke or in cancerous tissues. 'This collaboration changed my perspective on the biology of the heart,' said Alon. 'Our combination of mathematical models, fundamental biology, and medical research has revealed something new. Now, future studies can explore whether this hot-cold fibrosis distinction applies to scarring in other organs.'

Former Hamas hostage Emily Damari undergoes surgeries for injurie...	Damari lost two fingers when she was shot by Hamas gunmen during the Oct. 7, 2023, kidnapping from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. By JNS Emily Damari, a British-Israeli woman who was taken captive during Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre and held for 471 days in Gaza, underwent a series of surgeries on her hand and leg on Sunday due to complications from the wounds inflicted on her by the Palestinian terrorist organization. In a statement from Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer in Ramat Gan before the operation, Damari said she 'fully embraced' her scars, explaining, 'To me, they represent freedom, hope and strength. 'My recovery will take time and my hand will never fully recover, but the intense pain I had for a year and a half due to the nerves being sewn together after my first operation at Shifa Hospital in Gaza is now no longer with me and the large scar, that was caused by an open, festering wound that did not heal for four months because of the conditions of the tunnels I was held in, is now looking better,' she continued. Damari and two other Israeli hostages were handed over by Hamas to a team of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza on Jan. 19, as part of the ceasefire agreement with the terrorist organization. Following a medical examination and reunion with their mothers at an IDF reception point near the Gaza border and their subsequent transfer to the hospital via helicopter, Sheba General Hospital Director Dr. Yael Frenkel Nir told reporters that the women’s physical condition was good enough to allow them to focus on reuniting with other family members. Damari lost two fingers when she was shot by Hamas gunmen during the Oct. 7, 2023, kidnapping from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Emily’s mother, Mandy, said on Sunday that her daughter had been 'sewn up like a pin cushion' in Gaza, leaving her in considerable pain. Hamas did not provide anything besides an expired bottle of iodine during her captivity, Mandy Damari noted, adding that 'it is nothing short of a miracle that she did not contract a life-threatening infection.' For long stretches of time, the group kept her in its underground tunnels network with no sanitation or access to clean water, Emily Damari said. 'It was shocking but not surprising to see how emaciated some of the other hostages were when they came out. Hamas has created hell on Earth, the conditions down there are unimaginable,' she said. 'I want to thank President [U.S. President Donald] Trump again for securing the deal to get me home. Please help us to bring home Gali, Ziv and all of the remaining hostages as well, before it is too late for all of them,' Damari pleaded, referencing twin brothers Gali and Ziv Berman, her close friends from Kibbutz Kfar Aza who were abducted alongside her during the attack. Israeli assessments indicate that Palestinian terrorist groups in the Strip are holding 59 hostages. Of these, 24 are believed to be alive—all men—while 35, including three women, are believed to be deceased. Two of the living hostages and three of the deceased are foreign nationals.

Elderly man murdered, 4 wounded in Haifa terror attack	Arab terrorist stabs pedestrians at bus stop in northern Israeli city of Haifa, murdering one and wounding four others. By World Israel News Staff At least five people were wounded, including one fatally, in a terrorist stabbing attack in the northern Israeli city of Haifa Monday morning. The attack occurred at a bus stop adjacent to the Lev HaMifratz Mall (Cinemall), near the Haifa Central Bus Station just after 9:50 a.m. Monday when a terrorist began stabbing pedestrians waiting at the bus stop. There are currently unverified reports that a second terrorist was also involved in the attack. Police have dispatched forces to the area and launched a manhunt for additional terrorists. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were called to the scene to treat the wounded and evacuate them to Rambam Medical Center in Haifa. Paramedics were forced to declare one victim, a 70-year-old man, dead at the scene. According to an MDA spokesperson, four other victims were treated at the scene before being evacuated to Rambam Medical Center, including three people in serious condition including a man and a woman in their early 30s and a teenage boy roughly 15 years of age. In addition, a 70-year-old woman is listed in moderate condition. MDA chief spokesman Zaki Heller said that the terrorist responsible for the stabbing was shot and killed during the attack by soldiers and armed civilians. Witnesses say the terrorist took a bus to Haifa, and, upon his arrival, got off the bus and began shouting 'Allahu Akbar' before stabbing his victims. The attack comes just days after a Palestinian Arab terrorist illegally residing in northern Israel rammed into pedestrians waiting at a bus stop at Karkur Junction near Pardes Hanna last Thursday, injuring 14 people, one of them critically.

HaLevi: Many Oct. 7th victims’ last words were ‘Where’s the IDF?’	Herzi HaLevi admitted that the army never believed that Hamas was capable of carrying out a terror onslaught on the scale of October 7th. By World Israel News Staff Outgoing IDF Chief-of-Staff Herzi HaLevi spoke of the Israeli military's profound failures on October 7th, saying that he is aware that the final thoughts of many murdered on that day were questioning the IDF's whereabouts. 'I know lots of people were murdered, and their last words were, ‘Where is the IDF?’ I know that,' HaLevi, who resigned from his role in January, told Channel 12 News in an interview broadcast Sunday evening. HaLevi said that the army did not believe that Hamas was capable of carrying out a terror onslaught on that scale. 'We considered Hamas to be a limited military force. We didn’t see a scenario of a wide surprise attack as a realistic scenario. And if there was to be something like that, our assumption was that we would get a warning ahead of time from [military] intelligence,' he said. He added that when he considered which of Israel's borders posed the biggest security risk, 'I put the Gaza as the last border that needed attention.' HaLevi stressed that the Israeli military was confident in the Gaza border, including a prevailing belief that 'the subterranean barrier was very high quality,' that Israeli had superior intelligence gathering and that the physical topography of the region was advantageous to Israel. 'We thought our situation overall was good,' he said. HaLevi spoke of the IDF's failed defense of many Gaza-adjacent kibbutzim, confirming the claims of many residents that troops never reached some communities at all while the invasion was ongoing. 'The results were terrible. As someone from Nir Oz told me, the first soldier arrived after the last terrorist had left,' HaLevi said. 'That’s the worst thing that we could hear.' HaLevi is being succeeded by Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who is slated to take office on Thursday, March 5. Zamir has already summoned senior military officials to Southern Command for a meeting this Friday, underscoring Israel's threat to return to war against Hamas in Gaza.

Israel considering cutting electricity to Gaza, evacuating Gazans...	Israeli government mulling plans to pressure Hamas to resume hostage releases, including cutting electricity transfers to the Gaza Strip, resuming war on Hamas, and evacuating Gazans from the northern Gaza Strip. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's government is considering a number of measures to pressure Hamas into releasing additional hostages, the Israeli national broadcaster Kan reported Sunday night, after the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas lapsed over the weekend. On Sunday, the first phase of the January 19th ceasefire ended, with no agreement on either a continuation of the existing hostages-for-truce arrangement or implementation of the second phase of the hostage deal. While Israel embraced an American proposal to extend the truce through the Ramadan and Passover holidays, ending on April 19th, in exchange for the release of all remaining hostages in two transfers, Hamas has insisted Israel negotiate the full withdrawal of IDF forces from Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Sunday that the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip be halted until Hamas agrees to resume the release of hostages held in Gaza. Later that day, Israeli media outlets reported that Jerusalem has drafted a plan to pressure Hamas into resuming the hostage releases. According to Channel 14, Energy Minister Eli Cohen (Likud) is set to formally propose to the Israeli cabinet that Israel cut off Gaza from Israel's electric grid. Following the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7th, Israel cut Gaza off from its electric grid, leaving the coastal enclave reliant on electric generators, leading to rolling blackouts. Last July, however, Israel resumed the transfer of electricity to parts of the Gaza Strip, powering a number of public facilities, including water treatment plants and desalination operations. Should Israel adopt Cohen's plan, it could potentially leave Gaza with total blackouts, once the current supply of fuel has been exhausted. Kan reported that in addition to cutting off Gaza from the electric grid, Jerusalem is considering evacuating the northern Gaza Strip once again, sealing off the area and relocating residents to the Khan Yunis and Rafah districts. Furthermore, Israel is mulling resuming hostilities in the Gaza Strip within a week, including the use of heavy air munitions barred by the Biden administration.

Nasrallah’s kids say his ‘soul was killed’ by pager operation	Nasrallah's son says he was extremely depressed, already dead in spirit after pager blasts, assassination of his close confidant. By World Israel News Staff Slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was deeply depressed after the Mossad pager operation, which saw the mass detonation of communication devices used by the terror group, killing at least 42 operatives and wounding some 3,500. Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese news channel Al Manar aired an interview on Sunday featuring Nasrallah's son Jawad and his daughter Zainab, in which they spoke about the impact of the operation on their father. Jawad told the outlet that Nasrallah 'wept for the young men' killed and injured in the blasts. 'He considered every one of them his son and felt their pain deeply,' Jawad said. Zainab confirmed that her mother said Nasrallah cried following the operation. 'The families of the martyrs held a special place in his heart,' she said. The beeper explosions, which came shortly after Nasrallah's close confidant and senior Hezbollah member Fuad Shukr was assassinated in an Israeli airstrike, had been too much for him to bear. Those who encountered Nasrallah after those two events observed that 'he [was] no longer with us,' Jawad said. Nasrallah's children's comments echoed that of Mossad agents involved in the operation, who were interviewed by 60 Minutes in December 2024. 'If you look at his eyes, he was defeated,' one agent said, stressing the operation's profound effect on Nasrallah. 'He already lost the war.' Hezbollah operatives looking at Nasrallah in his first post-pager operation speech 'saw a broken leader.' In a plan that took years to come to fruition, Mossad agents placed small amounts of highly explosive materials inside of walkie-talkies and pagers used by Hezbollah. Mossad established shell companies in numerous countries in order to deceive Hezbollah, though it's unclear exactly where the pagers were booby-trapped. Gold Apollo, the Taiwan-based brand whose pagers were used, denied making the devices and said their name had been licensed to a Hungarian company. That Hungarian company claimed to have only been an intermediary and that they did not manufacture the devices.

Wannabe Iran spy is friend of rescued hostage Noa Argamani	Doron Bukobza, 28, posted heartfelt plea for the release of Argamani and her boyfriend after they were kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival on October 7th. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli man charged with offering to sell information about Israel's nuclear program to Iran is a personal friend of rescued hostage Noa Argamani and her boyfriend Avinatan Or, who is still in Hamas captivity. Prosecutors filed charges against Beersheba resident Doron Bukobza, 28, on Sunday, including contact with a hostile entity and transferring intelligence to the enemy in wartime. According to the indictment, Bukobza is a trained engineer who worked at a chemical engineering plant. He reached out to Iranian agents on the Telegram messaging app, falsely claiming that he was an employee at the Negev Nuclear Research Center and offering to sell them information about the site. The indictment noted that all the information Bukobza offered his handlers is already publicly available. Hebrew-langugae media outlets that viewed Bukobza's social media accounts saw numerous pictures of him with both Argamani, a native of his hometown, and Or, along with a heartfelt post pleading for their return after they were kidnapped from the Nova Festival on October 7th, 2023. 'Noa Argamani, where were we 8 years ago? Smiling and laughing. Where were we five years ago, on some remote mountain in Bolivia. I rented a motorbike and you trusted me enough to be able to climb a steep mountain and take a picture of you looking at the Amazon River,' Bukobza wrote in the post, referencing a trip that they had apparently taken together through South America. 'Noa, how hard it was for me to see your kidnapping with Avinatan, my friend! A man I looked up to like a savior for me. Noa and Avintan! Waiting for you! Come back soon, safe and sound!' he wrote, alongside photos of him with the two abductees. Bukobza was arrested by the authorities last month, but the indictment against him was only made public on Sunday.

‘Dr. Hamas’: Freed hostage Emily Damari recounts medical neglect ...	Emily Damari: 'I am truly at peace with my injury. I know there’s still a long road to recovery, but this time, I’m surrounded by family and friends who love me.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Freed hostage Emily Damari, whose injuries inspired the widely recognized hand gesture expressing solidarity with hostages, recounts medical neglect and inadequate care for her serious wounds during her captivity in Gaza but says she is making significant progress since her release. During the attack on October 7, Damari was shot in the hand and leg and lost two fingers. 'Hamas provided me with no medical treatment except for an expired bottle of iodine and some bandages,' she said. The lack of basic medical care and even clean water makes the fact that she didn’t suffer from a fatal infection a medical miracle, her mother, Mandy, said, adding that her daughter was 'stitched up like a cushion.' In an Instagram post, Damari shared more details of her first moments in Gaza and her recovery since her release. '‘Hi, I’m Dr. Hamas,’ that’s what the doctor at Shifa [Hospital] told me before my ‘surgery.’ Seventeen months have passed since then, and now the moment I’ve been waiting for has finally arrived—the real surgery at Sheba Medical Center.' 'I remember sitting in Shifa on October 7, staring at a small window. My hand was shattered, and my leg was wounded from the bullet that had hit my beloved dog, Chucha, the most precious thing I had for 11 years.' 'And then came that moment—they took me into the operating room, and right in front of me lay a corpse. I looked up and saw the blue sky that should have been gray on such a day. I prayed for God to watch over me. When I woke up, ‘Dr. Hamas’ told me I had lost two fingers, and my leg wound had been left open with only four stitches instead of sixteen.' 'Today, after 17 months, I finally get to exchange Shifa for Sheba and receive the treatment I deserve.' 'I am truly at peace with my injury. I know there’s still a long road to recovery, but this time, I’m surrounded by family and friends who love me—that’s what really matters. I am proud of my disability, and with it, I will win.'

Only 6 percent of Gazans want Hamas to remain in power, majority ...	About 70% of Gazans polled said they didn’t think Hamas was in control of the situation. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A poll of Gazans found that only 6% believe Hamas should continue to rule the Gaza Strip, while 67.9% gave US President Donald Trump credit for the ceasefire. The poll, conducted by the Palestinian Institute for Social and Economic Progress (ISEP) on January 22, surveyed 400 people over the age of 15 from 34 locations in Gaza before the conflict. About 70% of those polled said they didn’t think Hamas was in control of the situation, though it was unclear whether 'the situation' referred to governing Gaza or managing the war. Just 5.3% of Gazans said they would vote for Hamas in the next election, and support for the Fatah party increased by 12 percentage points. Half of those polled said they looked forward to Gaza being rebuilt in better condition than it was before. This was before Trump proposed that the US take over and rebuild Gaza. Two-thirds of Gazans felt that the issue of humanitarian aid not reaching them was serious, and 44% said Hamas was solely responsible for this problem. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backed a plan proposed by Donald Trump that would resettle Gazan civilians, allowing for the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip. Trump’s proposal to resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip in third-party countries, Netanyahu said, is a 'bold new vision and the only plan that I think can work.' Defending Trump’s plan against accusations of ethnic cleansing, Netanyahu argued that most Gazans want to leave the Gaza Strip. 'Why not give Gazans a choice? Everybody said this is the largest open-air prison in the world. Not because of us. We let people leave.' 'In fact, if you want to know, over the last couple of years—two years, I think—150,000 Gazans left. You know how they left? Because they bribed their way out, not through us. They bribed their way out.'

Entebbe survivor launches viral campaign for Israeli hostages	Every day at 11:59 am, participants upload a 60-second video or photo of themselves calling for the hostages’ release, using the hashtags #HopeAMinute and #UntilTheLastOne. By Jewish Breaking News A single minute at 11:59 am. That’s what Benny Davidson is asking of the world. Not money, not protests, just 60 seconds of visible solidarity for Israel’s hostages in Gaza whose suffering the 61-year-old understands with rare intimacy. Davidson was just 13 when terrorists hijacked Air France Flight 139 en route from Tel Aviv to Paris on June 27, 1976. He sat with his family as two Palestinian and two German hijackers took control, separating Jewish and Israeli passengers from others. Under the protection of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, the terrorists held them hostage while demanding the release of hundreds of terrorists worldwide. The psychological toll of captivity remains vivid in Davidson’s memory all these decades later. 'We were hijacked after a stopover in Athens and landed in Benghazi, Libya for a couple of hours and then continued to Entebbe. We didn’t know that we were going to spend a week there,' Davidson recalls to Jewish News. 'The main issue of becoming a hostage is not just taking away your freedom, it’s taking away your ability to predict what’s going to be in the next minute, or in the next hour, or in the next day.' When the terrorists announced they would collect identification documents, Davidson’s father discovered he was carrying his Israeli Air Force combat navigator ID. 'Now, a captain in the Israeli Air Force, a combat navigator, is not someone you want to fall in the hands of terrorists,' Davidson says. 'So what did my father do? He tore it to four pieces. Each one of us got a piece. We continued to tear it to small papers, put it in our mouth, made small paper balls out of it, and threw it in a soft green can in the seat in front of us, and within two minutes, there was no more Israeli Air Force combat navigator on the plane.' Remarkably, his parents established routines throughout their captivity by organizing a makeshift library, washing dishes, distributing food, and playing games. 'They built some sort of internal strength; resilience, translating a potential trauma into great power. And I can sum it up into two factors. One is to enable order in a chaotic situation. And that was one hell of a chaotic situation,' he says. 'Because you’re guarded by 10 terrorists and over 100 Ugandans. So you should fear for your life. But when you use daily routines, it enables you to mask, to some extent, the terror. It’s order versus chaos.' Famously, the Entebbe hostage crisis ended when Israel’s elite Sayeret Matkal commandos stormed the airport on July 3, 1976. Led by Yoni Netanyahu, brother to Israel’s current Prime Minister, 'Operation Thunderbolt' successfully rescued 102 of the 106 hostages, though Netanyahu himself was killed during the raid. Now, nearly five decades later, Davidson has transformed his experience into a mission, launching #HopeAMinute to advocate for the remaining Oct. 7 hostages in Gaza. Every day at 11:59 am, participants upload a 60-second video or photo of themselves calling for the hostages’ release, using the hashtags #HopeAMinute and #UntilTheLastOne. 'Let’s stand for one minute. Just 60 seconds at 11:59 am and take a photo or a video of ourselves with a crowd, if we are at home with our kids, if we’re in a restaurant, if we’re in the office, if we’re in a factory, if we’re in a shopping mall, if we’re in the streets,' Davidson tells the UK Jewish news outlet. Davidson is actively recruiting schools, universities, sports teams, and offices to join the campaign, emphasizing that participation requires no special equipment or preparation. 'You don’t need to dress, you don’t need to hold a placard or something. You don’t need the drums. You don’t need whistles. You don’t need anything,' he explains. The idea gives people 'a sense of closeness and togetherness in stating something that everybody is for.'

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized Hamas for rejecting an extension of the ceasefire and hostage deal proposed by Trump's special envoy, Steven Witkoff, and warned that 'there will be consequences.' After Hamas rejected the proposal, Israel withheld humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip on Sunday. Netanyahu stated that a meeting was held with the Defense Minister and coalition members to discuss Witkoff's plan, which called for the release of hostages and a ceasefire during Ramadan and Passover. 'We are fully coordinating with President Trump and his team,' he said. According to Witkoff's plan, the first day of the ceasefire would coincide with the release of half of the hostages, and the remaining hostages would be freed if a final agreement was reached. Witkoff explained that he proposed the plan as a way to bridge the divide between Israel and Hamas, which is currently hindering Phase 2 of the deal. Israel is hesitant to agree to a full withdrawal from Gaza, as required by later phases of the agreement, and Hamas is unwilling to give up control over the Gaza Strip. 'He even described his proposal as a bridge for negotiations on Phase 2. Israel is ready for this,' Netanyahu said. Netanyahu added that, according to the latest information, there are 59 hostages still held in Gaza, and it is estimated that 24 of them are still alive. 'We are not giving up on any of them, and we are determined to bring them all home,' he emphasized. Netanyahu firmly rejected the accusation that Israel violated the ceasefire deal, stating, 'Hamas has violated the Phase 1 agreement repeatedly.' The prime minister pointed out that, under the terms of the agreement, fighting could resume on the 42nd day if negotiations fail to yield results. US President Donald Trump said he would stand by Israel, whether it continued the ceasefire or felt it had to return to fighting, adding, 'I am fine with whatever decision Israel makes.'

Since January 19, Israeli forces have arrested more than 200 terror suspects, eliminated 71 others who were deemed security threats, and confiscated more than 300 weapons and explosives. By Ehud Amiton, TPS Security forces intensified their operations in Judea and Samaria, eliminating approximately 25 terrorists and arresting 350 wanted individuals during the month of February, the Israel Defense Forces said on Sunday. Soldiers also confiscated around 120 weapons and destroyed hundreds of explosives. The operations focused on northern Samaria and other key areas to disrupt Palestinian terror networks. The army launched an ongoing counterterror raid in the Jenin refugee camp on Jan. 19. It has since expanded to the Palestinian city Tulkarem and an area of Samaria known as 'the Five Villages.' The raids come on the heels of the Palestinian Authority’s failed crackdown in the Jenin refugee camp in January. Since January 19, Israeli forces have arrested more than 200 terror suspects, eliminated 71 others who were deemed security threats, and confiscated more than 300 weapons and explosives. Since Hamas’s October 7 attack, Israeli forces have arrested 6,000 wanted Palestinians in counterterror operations in Judea and Samaria. Around 40 percent were affiliated with Hamas.

Aleh provides cutting-edge therapies, specialized education, advocacy, and a nurturing environment for children and young adults with complex disabilities. By Pesach Benson, TPS For Liran Menashe, what started as a routine job six years ago has since evolved into a heartwarming Purim tradition for Israeli children with severe physical and cognitive disabilities. 'It all began when we were working on exterior sealing and waterproofing at Aleh’s facility in Bnei Brak. As we rappelled down the building, the children inside were mesmerized, watching us with excitement and curiosity,' said Menashe, an army reservist. 'At the end of the day, the center’s director, Hani Klein, approached me and asked if we could turn this into a costume-themed rappelling performance for Purim. We immediately said yes. We felt it was a great privilege to bring them joy,' Menashe explained. What began as a spontaneous act of kindness has since grown into an annual celebration, attracting more volunteers each year. On Friday, amid the backdrop of war, the event took on an even deeper significance. In honor of Israel’s resilience, Hani Klein proposed the theme of 'Heroic Soldiers.' Responding to the call, reservists from various combat units — many recently returned from the frontlines in Gaza and Lebanon — arrived at Aleh not for battle, but for a mission of joy. The atmosphere at Aleh was electric as the soldiers, equipped with harnesses and ropes, rappelled down from the rooftop, each carrying Purim gift packages known as mishloach manot. As they touched the ground, the children erupted in cheers, clapping and running toward their heroes with excitement. Before the festivities began, the event opened with a solemn tribute. Orange balloons were released into the sky in memory of Shiri Bibas and her two young children, Ariel and Kfir, who were murdered in Hamas captivity, as well as all those who lost their lives in the October 7 massacre. document.createElement('video'); Aleh provides cutting-edge therapies, specialized education, advocacy, and a nurturing environment for children and young adults with complex disabilities. 'These children are warriors in their own right, facing daily challenges with incredible courage,' said Yehuda Marmorstein, founder and CEO of Aleh. 'To see IDF soldiers, who have fought on the battlefield, come here and embrace our children with such warmth and joy—it is truly a testament to the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish people.' After the event, Aleh presented the reservists with special certificates of appreciation inscribed with the words: *'For descending without limits, and spreading joy without boundaries.'* 'The smiles on the children’s faces fill our hearts every year,' Menashe said. Purim celebrates the Jewish people’s survival from a plot to exterminate them in ancient Persia, as described in the Book of Esther. The holiday is celebrated with feasting, costumes, and giving gifts of food and charity.

Arab states to present alternative to Trump’s Gaza plan at March ...	Abdelatty emphasized that the role of the E.U. and European countries is critical, especially in funding the rebuilding of the war-torn enclave. By JNS Cairo’s reconstruction proposal for the Gaza Strip, which seeks to put forward an alternative to U.S. President Donald Trump’s relocation plan, will be presented at an emergency Arab summit on Tuesday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told reporters. 'We will hold intensive talks with major donor countries once the plan is adopted at the upcoming Arab Summit,' Abdelatty declared, speaking on Sunday alongside E.U. Commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Šuica. Cairo’s counter-proposal will not be exclusively Egyptian or Arab but seeks to garner international support and funding to ensure its implementation in the coming years, according to Abdelatty. Abdelatty said that following Tuesday’s summit in Cairo, there will be an urgent ministerial meeting in Saudi Arabia for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, where foreign ministers of its 57 member states will push for the summit’s outcomes to be promoted worldwide. Abdelatty emphasized that the role of the E.U. and European countries is critical, especially in funding the rebuilding of the war-torn enclave. Egypt’s top diplomat stressed the importance of continuing the ceasefire deal that went into effect on Jan. 19, adding that Cairo will continue its efforts to ensure it is maintained and makes it to Phase 2. 'The first phase has concluded successfully, and now we must shift to discussions on the second phase, which is key to sustaining the ceasefire,' Abdelatty said. 'Naturally, it will be difficult, but with goodwill and political determination, it can be achieved.' Israel is backing the temporary ceasefire framework proposed by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff for the Ramadan and Passover period, while the Hamas terrorist organization has flat-out rejected the proposal. Last month, Trump announced his shock relocation proposal during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip,' the U.S. president announced. 'We’ll own it. … We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal, … the Riviera of the Middle East,' Trump said. He later suggested that Gaza’s entire population should go to other countries. Egypt and Jordan, which Trump suggested would absorb Palestinians, have condemned the U.S. plan to relocate Gaza’s two million residents. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that the Trump administration is open to 'a better plan' from Arab nations.

Israeli man tried to sell info on Dimona nuclear facility to Iran...	Doron Buchbaza of Beersheba indicted after he contacted Iranian intelligence and offered to sell information regarding Israel's Dimona nuclear power plant. By JNS A Beersheba resident has been indicted for contacting Iranian intelligence agents and offering to sell them information about Israel’s Dimona nuclear facility, the Israeli Police announced on Sunday. Doron Buchbaza was arrested last month following a joint investigation by Lahav 433’s National Unit for International Crimes and the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet). He is accused of initiating contact with Iranian operatives, offering to sell sensitive information and falsely claiming to have access to Israel’s Nuclear Research Center. The investigation revealed that Buchbaza had carried out several security tasks for Iran over a number of months, including photographing facilities and providing publicly available information to Iranian operatives. He was arrested on suspicion of engaging in espionage for financial gain. On Sunday, Buchbaza was formally charged with offenses including contact with a foreign agent and supplying information to the enemy. This marks the 16th case of Israeli citizens being charged with contact with the enemy since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023.

Less than half of remaining hostages still alive, says Netanyahu	Israeli prime minister warns Hamas of unspecified 'consequences' if it fails to release hostages, as Israel reserves the right to return to hostilities should talks with Hamas fail to make progress. By World Israel News Staff Roughly 40% of Israeli hostages still held captive in the Gaza Strip are believed to be alive, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told government ministers at the opening of the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday. Citing information collected by Israeli intelligence agencies, Netanyahu told ministers that out of the 59 remaining hostages held in Gaza, it is currently believed that at least 35 of them are dead, with no more than 24 of them still alive. 'We are not giving up on any of them, and we are determined to bring them all home,' Netanyahu said. The prime minister discussed his decision earlier that day to halt the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip, after Hamas refused to either extend the first phase of the ceasefire and hostage deal, or agree to the plan proposed by President Donald Trump's special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. The plan, which Israel announced over the weekend it would accept, would continue the Gaza ceasefire through the Ramadan and Passover holidays, the latter of which ends on April 19th. Half of the remaining 59 Israeli hostages would be released in the first day of the ceasefire, with the remaining hostages to be freed on the last day. Netanyahu emphasized that Israel is working 'in full coordination with President Trump and his administration,' while accusing Hamas of repeatedly flouting the original hostage deal. 'Israel has not violated the agreement, while Hamas has repeatedly violated Phase 1.' 'According to the original agreement, Israel can resume fighting after 42 days if it determines that negotiations are ineffective. This clause was supported by a side letter from the previous U.S. administration and has also received backing and support from the Trump administration.' While Israel is prepared to 'immediately enter negotiations' with Hamas to implement Witkoff's proposal, Netanyahu said that without the release of hostages, Israel will not continue the ceasefire indefinitely. 'If Hamas thinks it can extend the ceasefire or benefit from the conditions of Phase 1 without releasing hostages—it is gravely mistaken.' 'There will be further consequences,' Netanyahu warned, 'which I will not elaborate on here.'

UK police probe controversial BBC Gaza documentary	BBC documentary on the Gaza war which featured Hamas leader’s son and intentionally mistranslated Gazan civilians to conceal antisemitism faces police probe. By World Israel News Staff London police are probing a BBC documentary on the Gaza war for possible wrong-doing, following a wave of complaints against the film. The BBC first aired the film, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, on February 17th, but just three days later dropped the documentary from its video-on-demand service, BBC iPlayer, after critics lambasted the film’s producers for whitewashing Hamas by largely ignoring the terror group’s atrocities, by intentionally mistranslating comments by local Gazans to obscure their antisemitism, and by selecting the son of a senior Hamas official as a narrator. The film’s pro-Hamas bias, marking the latest in a long list of Israel-related controversies for the British national broadcaster, not only provided fodder for the BBC’s critics but raised serious questions regarding the possible misappropriation of taxpayer funds. Last Friday, the BBC apologized for the film, acknowledging 'serious flaws' in its production. The broadcast vowed 'it no plans to broadcast the program again in its current form or return it to iPlayer.' Following a meeting of the BBC Board, the broadcaster pinned some of the blame on the production company Hoyo Films. 'Some of these were made by the production company, and some by the BBC; all of them are unacceptable. BBC News takes full responsibility for these and the impact that these have had on the Corporation’s reputation. We apologize for this.' Of particular concern is the possibility that BBC funds may have been disbursed to Gazans linked to the Hamas terror organization – including the family of film narrator Abdullah al-Yazouri, whose father, Ayman Alyazouri, serves as deputy minister of agriculture in Hamas de facto government in Gaza. 'Hoyo Films have told us that they paid the boy’s mother, via his sister’s bank account, a limited sum of money for the narration,' the BBC said. 'While Hoyo Films have assured us that no payments were made to members of Hamas or its affiliates, either directly, in kind, or as a gift, the BBC is seeking additional assurance around the budget of the program and will undertake a full audit of expenditure. We are requesting the relevant financial accounts of the production company in order to do that.' The London Metropolitan Police’s counter-terror force have already launched a preliminary probe into the matter, a spokesperson said Friday, to determine whether a criminal investigation into the BBC is necessary. 'We're aware of a BBC documentary about Gaza and we have received a number of reports raising concerns.' 'Officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command are currently assessing whether any police action is required in relation to this matter.'

Reform rabbi: ‘Hamas is the Palestinians,’ two-state solution a d...	While a path to a two-state solution is listed by the Union for Reform Judaism as an 'essential' part of its longstanding positions on Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Hirsch said he no longer believed that was possible. By Andrew Bernard, JNS The murder of Shiri Bibas and her two children at the hands of Palestinian terrorists has ended the possibility of a two-state solution, a prominent Reform rabbi preached on Friday. Rabbi Ammiel Hirsch, senior rabbi at New York City’s Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, told congregants in an explosive Shabbat sermon that he had 'snapped' over the killings. 'This was the week that finally ended the hope–at least in my lifetime–for a Palestinian state and a Jewish state existing side-by-side,' Hirsch said. 'The Palestinians themselves strangled this fragile hope in its crib.' 'Until such time as the Palestinians themselves say they want peaceful coexistence—two states living side-by-side—we must cease deluding ourselves that a two-state solution is available now,' he added. Gazan terrorists abducted Shiri Bibas, 32, and her two sons Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 9-months-old, from Kibbutz Nir Oz in the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Based on forensic evidence, their captors murdered the two children 'with their bare hands' within weeks of the attacks, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The funeral for the three victims was held on Wednesday after their bodies were returned to Israel as part of Phase 1 of the ceasefire-for-hostages deal between Hamas and Israel. According to Hirsch, the murders and Hamas’s staging of parade-like ceremonies to crowds of cheering Gazans during the release of emaciated Israeli hostages is an indictment of Palestinian society, which suffers from a 'moral miasma and social collapse' and whose national movement fuels 'an endless cycle of violent depravity.' 'The polite lie that we tell ourselves over and over again is that Hamas does not represent the Palestinians. It is simply not true,' Hirsch said. 'We recite this like a mantra so that we do not have to face the terrible truth that Hamas is the Palestinians. That Palestinianism is more about destroying the Jewish state than creating a state of their own.' 'On Oct. 7, there were only wild celebrations on the streets of Gaza as hostages were enslaved and corpses defiled,' he said. 'Many of the hostages were held in apartment complexes of ordinary civilians. Thousands were in on the secret. No one objected. No one helped the hostages escape.' Hirsch, who is president of the New York Board of Rabbis and is frequently cited as one of the most influential leaders of Reform Judaism, has previously described himself as 'committed to the two-state solution.' He said on Friday that he had been a lifelong supporter of coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. While a path to a two-state solution is listed by the Union for Reform Judaism as an 'essential' part of its longstanding positions on Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Hirsch said he no longer believed that was possible. 'How do you make peace with such neighbors?' he asked. 'Never is a long time, but how do you make peace with such neighbors now?' 'I hope I’m wrong,' he added.

Top Thai and Israeli officials debunk rumors of Israeli ‘settleme...	Conspiracy theory spread online that Israelis viewed the Pai district as a new 'Promised Land.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Thai and Israeli governments sent senior representatives to a Thai province Wednesday to debunk recent widespread rumors in the Asian country of Israeli settlements being established there, Ynet reported Sunday. Israeli Ambassador Orna Sagiv came to the town of Pai in the northern Mae Hong Son province together with Thailand’s deputy prime minister and interior minister, Anutin Charnvirakul. They toured together the Chabad Jewish outreach center in Pai, which had been the center of the conspiracy theory, spread online, that Israelis viewed Pai as a new 'Promised Land,' and that Chabad was preparing a settlement for an alleged 30,000 who had already come to live in the district. A few days before the visit, Chabad head Rabbi Nehemia Wilhelm had hosted reporters in an effort to combat the rumors, which he blamed in part on 'pro-Palestinian sources.' The 30,000 number touted by the conspiracy theorists was the total count of Israelis who had toured Pai in all of last year, he noted, and when asked, 'Why do you believe Pai is the Promised Land?' he answered, 'You are mistaken. Pai is the Promised Land for the Thai people and Israel is the Promised Land for Israelis.' The report said that Sagiv showed Charnvirakul a wall of stickers in the Chabad House of Israeli hostages being held by Hamas, which had been set up in response to anger in the community over the stickers being placed all over town by various Israeli tourists. Sagiv explained that people just 'want to express their grief' but that 'there is no bad intention behind it.' At a later meeting in a Pai hotel with some 150 local government officials, police and military commanders, business representatives and Israeli residents, locals talked of being upset about public behavior exhibited by Israelis that disrespected Thai culture and norms. Sagiv noted that with 300,000 Israelis visiting Thailand last year, 'it’s inevitable that some will misbehave but it’s unfair to judge all Israelis by the actions of a few.' She also mentioned that Israelis 'love' Thailand and the behavior the Thais found unacceptable was due in large part to a simple misunderstanding of their culture, which she urged Israelis to learn about so they could avoid insulting their hosts. Charnvirakul translated her statements, noting that it would be helpful if the cultural education went both ways, so Thais would not get offended by Israeli norms. The Wednesday meetings followed a statement by Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra repudiating the rumors herself eleven days ago. 'We've already verified that this is not true,' she said. This was backed up last week by the Bangkok Post, which reported that 'Police have combed through Pai district &#8230; and did not find any Israeli influence, settlements or business dominance as social media reported.' It quoted the head of the district’s police force as stating that the rumors 'made no sense,' and that the authorities 'have examined all streets, car rental premises, guesthouses, religious facilities, villages and hotels. All businesses belong to Thais and no foreigners own them.'

US federal workers hit with second wave of emails demanding job d...	The second round of emails do not include any threat of retaliation for noncompliance but say workers are expected to send responses at the beginning of each work week. By Reuters and The Algemeiner The Trump administration sent out a second round of emails on Friday evening demanding all federal employees summarize their work over the past week after the first effort fizzled amid a wave of confusing directives. The emails from the government’s human resources arm, the US Office of Personnel Management, were sent to multiple agencies, Reuters has confirmed, and asked workers to list five things they accomplished during the week. The move marks a renewed effort by billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency team to assess the performance of government employees as the administration looks to engage in mass layoffs to dramatically trim the federal footprint. 'The President has made it clear that this is mandatory for the executive branch,' Musk wrote on X. 'Anyone working on classified or other sensitive matters is still required to respond if they receive the email, but can simply reply that their work is sensitive.' Musk attempted a similar tack last week, along with a threat that noncompliant workers could be fired, but he was stymied when some agencies such as the State and Justice departments told their employees to stick to the chain of command. Ultimately, OPM informed agencies that responding to the emails was voluntary. But Musk, with President Donald Trump’s backing, continued to press for the emails as a means they said to hold workers accountable. Both men suggested that some federal employees on the payroll don’t exist. The second round of emails do not include any threat of retaliation for noncompliance but say workers are expected to send responses at the beginning of each work week. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed Pentagon workers to comply, according to media reports, but the State Department again told their employees to hold off, according to a directive seen by Reuters. The acting US attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, also told workers in his office to comply, according to a message seen by Reuters. Reuters was able to confirm the emails were also sent to employees at the Internal Revenue Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Institutes for Health. Those agencies have all been targeted by DOGE for layoffs. Musk’s team last week instructed agencies across the government to submit plans by March 13 for a 'significant reduction' in staffing across the federal workforce. Already, about 100,000 workers have taken buyouts or been fired after DOGE was dispatched by Trump to gut federal staffing and spending. There are about 2.3 million federal employees in all. The layoffs have occurred in such haphazard fashion that some agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration have been forced to recall key personnel in order to ensure public safety. Most recently, the Trump administration has pulled the plug on a team of tech savvy civil servants that helped build the IRS’ free tax filing service and revamped websites across government. In an email sent overnight to employees of the US General Services Administration (GSA) and seen by Reuters, the GSA’s Director of Technology Transformation Services Thomas Shedd said the team — known as 18F — had been identified as 'non critical.' Formed at the tail end of the Barack Obama administration, the unit acted as an internal tech consultancy within government, ferreting out duplication and waste, streamlining bureaucratic processes, and making public-facing websites more user friendly. Questions about Musk’s role and DOGE are at the heart of multiple lawsuits seeking to block them from accessing government systems and confidential data. The suits allege that Musk and DOGE are violating the Constitution by wielding the kind of vast power that only comes from agencies created through the US Congress or appointments made with confirmation by the US Senate. Musk’s actions have also caused some tension and confusion among Trump’s White House aides, although Trump himself is said to be wholly on board with the effort. The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Musk is not a Cabinet-level official and did not face US Senate confirmation. The Trump administration has been evasive about exactly what role he plays within DOGE.

Israel extends ability to call up reservists until end of May	The Washington Free Beacon reported on Friday that Jerusalem is preparing to resume the war in Gaza in four to six weeks. By JNS Amid the ongoing uncertainty concerning the situation in Gaza and the region generally, Israel’s government on Sunday morning approved an extension of legislation allowing the call-up of 400,000 reservists, according to Hebrew media reports. The decision extends reserve recruitment under Section 8 of the Reserve Service Law, 2008. The government authorized Defense Minister Israel Katz’s proposal to issue an order allowing the head of the Israel Defense Forces Operations Division and the head of Recruitment and Standby to call up to 400,000 reservists for service until May 29, 2025. The Washington Free Beacon reported on Friday that Jerusalem is preparing to resume the war in Gaza in four to six weeks. This 'decisive' campaign, aimed to wipe out Hamas, could be paused if the terrorist group’s leadership agrees to free hostages or agrees to disarm and go into exile, the report added.

IDF drafts plans to defend Syrian Druze community	Israeli prime minister and defense minister order IDF to prepare to intervene in Syria to defend a Druze town outside of the capital city of Damascus, amid attacks by the new regime. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli government has ordered the military to intervene militarily against the new Syrian regime and in defense of Syrian Druze living outside the capital city of Damascus. On Saturday night, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) have instructed the IDF to prepare to defend the majority Druze town of Jaramana, following clashes between Syrian military forces and local gunmen. A densely-populated suburb of Damascus, Jaramana is predominantly Druze, with a significant Arab Christian minority. Following the ouster of President Bashar Assad last year, multiple clashes have been reported in the Damascus area. On Friday, fighting broke out at a checkpoint outside of Jaramana, leaving one soldier dead, according to the UK-based, anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A day later, one person was killed and nine more wounded in another flare up in Jaramana. After the second incident, Katz threatened to intervene in defense of Syria's Druze minority. 'We will not allow the extremist Islamic terror regime in Syria to harm the Druze,' Katz said. 'We have instructed the IDF to prepare and to deliver a strong and clear warning: if the regime harms the Druze, it will be harmed by us.' 'We are committed to our Druze brothers in Israel and will do everything to prevent harm to their Druze brethren in Syria. We will take all necessary measures to ensure their security.'

‘A lot of gaslighting’: Former Biden staffer says campaign tried ...	LaRosa's remarks add to growing scrutiny of the Biden campaign's efforts to mislead the public about the former president's mental fitness. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Former president Joe Biden's aides engaged in 'a lot of gaslighting' to obscure the 82-year-old's cognitive decline from the American public, according to Michael LaRosa, who served as press secretary for former first lady Jill Biden. 'There are some things that are true, like the gaslighting. There was a lot of denial of the polling,' LaRosa told Puck News senior political correspondent Tara Palmeri during a Wednesday panel at American University. Palmeri had asked whether a forthcoming book's allegations that aides hid Biden's mental deterioration are true. 'Were you concerned about [Biden] running for reelection in 2024?' Palmeri asked. 'Um, yes,' LaRosa responded, saying that he had 'just assumed' Biden wouldn't run for reelection. LaRosa, who had worked on Biden's 2020 campaign, left the White House in 2022 and did not work on the reelection campaign. LaRosa's remarks add to growing scrutiny of the Biden campaign's efforts to mislead the public about the former president's mental fitness. This week, CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson announced the forthcoming book, Original Sin, which is set to offer an 'unflinching and explosive' account of Biden's reelection bid. Biden ran for reelection, the book says, 'despite evidence of his serious decline,' with Democrats going to 'desperate efforts to hide the extent of that deterioration.' Biden ultimately withdrew from the 2024 race following a disastrous debate performance. His replacement, Kamala Harris, went on to lose to President Donald Trump. The former aide said that allegations of a full-scale 'cover-up' of Biden's cognitive decline are 'a little harsh' but admitted that Biden's team engaged in 'a lot of gaslighting' to downplay concerns, even attacking New York Times polls that showed Biden behind. Biden's staff also tried to keep him away from the press. 'The president's team was scared to death of impromptu, unscripted, unrehearsed, unpracticed, unchoreographed anything,' LaRosa said.

‘US funded Hamas campaign to exterminate Israel,’ says ex-USAID o...	Officials testify to House subcommittee on how vast amounts of money has gone with no oversight to Gaza. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News In a recent Congressional hearing, the former chief operating officer of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) testified that the American agency had helped fund the Hamas terrorist organization with no oversight of how the money was spent. At a mid-February House Oversight Committee's Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency, Max Primorac said that 'USAID’s humanitarian aid system is broken. In Gaza, American aid financed Hamas’ campaign to exterminate Israel.' 'Similarly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria,' he continued, 'where we lack physical presence to ensure that our aid is not being diverted to terrorists.' When asked by Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Ten), Gregg Roman, executive director of conservative Middle East Forum (MEF) think tank, detailed several instances of funds reaching terror groups. 'We have assisted Al-Shabab in Somalia, the Hamzi network in Sudan, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah&#8230;dozens of terrorist organizations have received indirect assistance from U.S. foreign aid,' he said. In Gaza, he noted, '$2.1 billion in American tax payers’ money' has gone to the Hamas-ruled Strip 'since October 7 [2023], when Hamas invaded southern Israel.' 'USAID money was going in terms of an emergency use authorization' to parties with whom the agency 'had a formal relationship,' he said, but several government agencies that should have checked the recipients before the money transfers were made did not do so. These included being vetted against the Special Designated Terrorists list of the State Department, he said. 'Waivers were granted,' he said, 'because they said there was an emergency&#8230;thereby jettisoning the usual typical screening procedures. As a result, 90% of the aid that was going from the United States by way of its agents in Gaza ended up in Hamas-controlled areas, and this is ridiculous.' 'Essentially what the U.S. assistance to Gaza did was underwrite the ability of Hamas to survive until the ceasefire that just passed a few weeks ago,' he concluded. Primorac noted that during his tenure in the first Trump administration, 'we had a regulation in place that anyone who touches money in countries where there are terrorists, those names have to go through terrorist databases. That was overturned by [former president Joe] Biden.' In a follow-up hearing Wednesday, Roman said that MEF had 'uncovered evidence of $164 million in approved grants, $122 million of which ended up supporting radical or terror-tied organizations,' over the last decade and a half. One example he gave of such recipients was the Unlimited Friends Association in Gaza, whose officials 'have called for their lands to be cleansed from the impurity of the Jews,' he said. 'Primary grantees are entrusted to vet their own subcontractors, even when those grantees themselves might sympathize with radical causes,' he testified. 'In places like Gaza or Sudan, groups with blatant extremist affiliations slip through because the ‘gatekeepers’ have no incentive—or even ideological desire—to shut them out. This isn’t a glitch; it’s a feature of a broken system.' 'It’s a not just waste, fraud, and abuse, this is a national security problem,' Roman noted, and urged the Committee 'to make a formal criminal referral to the Department of Justice regarding USAID's systemic failure to prevent taxpayer dollars from reaching terrorist organizations.'

45,000 runners from Israel, abroad run in Tel Aviv Marathon	For the first time, Friday’s marathon introduced the 'Triumph of the Spirit' route—a 3-kilometer (~1.8-mile) race dedicated to wounded Israel Defense Forces soldiers. By JNS More than 45,000 runners participated in the annual Tel Aviv Marathon, which kicked off on Friday morning on the streets of the city. Runners set off on seven urban race routes, including the full marathon, half marathon, 10 km. race, 5 km. race and handcycle race. The marathon, running now for 16 consecutive years, welcomed elite athletes from Israel and abroad, including from Ethiopia, Kenya, and Morocco. Felix Kimutai, 36, from Kenya emerged the champion in the men’s marathon category, finishing in a time of 2:12:13. He fell two minutes and two seconds short of breaking the Tel Aviv Marathon record set in 2023 by fellow Kenyan Mibei Dominic Kipngeno, which stands at 2:10:11. Another Kenyan, Omosa Teresiah Kwamboka, 30, won the women’s race in a time of 2:37:36. This year, the sports event commemorated Israel’s security forces, who have been fighting on multiple fronts for over a year, ever since Hamas launched the deadliest single-day attack in Israel’s history on Oct. 7, 2023, murdering roughly 1,200 people and kidnapping 251 into the Gaza Strip. In a symbolic gesture of solidarity, 59 yellow balloons were released at the start of each race, representing the hostages still held captive. For the first time, Friday’s marathon introduced the 'Triumph of the Spirit' route—a 3-kilometer (~1.8-mile) race dedicated to wounded Israel Defense Forces soldiers.

Tel Aviv-Jaffa Mayor Ron Huldai said, 'The 2025 Tel Aviv Marathon concluded successfully, and I would like to congratulate all the participants—professionals, amateurs, children, and adults—who took part in Israel’s largest sporting event, experiencing a festive and athletic atmosphere throughout the city. 'This marathon was more than just a sports event; it embodied values of resilience, unity and determination. This year, we held it with heavy hearts, thinking of our loved ones still in captivity and our heroes who have fallen in war. We bowed our heads in their memory, embraced their families, and looked ahead—toward the triumph of the Israeli spirit. 'We were proud to salute our heroes—the soldiers, the wounded, and their families—who serve as an inspiration to us all. The Tel Aviv-Jaffa Municipality continuously promotes and encourages residents to engage in physical and sporting activities throughout the year,' Huldai said. The annual Tiberias Marathon was held on Jan. 3. The 2025 Jerusalem Marathon will take place on April 4.

Rubio orders $4 billion emergency weapons transfer to Israel	Reversing Biden's arms embargo' - Secretary of State Marco Rubio expedites delivery of military aid to Israel with $4 billion arms transfer, part of $12 billion in weapons sales since Trump took office. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration announced over the weekend that it is working to speed up delivery of billions of dollars-worth of military equipment to Israel, calling the move a reversal of the 'partial arms embargo' imposed by the Biden administration. On Saturday night, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement announcing emergency measures to expedite $4 billion in arms transfers to Israel. Citing the Biden White House’s suspension of the sale of some aerial munitions – including MK-84 one-ton bombs – Rubio panned the previous administration’s limits on weapon transfers, collectively dubbing them an 'arms embargo.' 'The decision to reverse the Biden Administration’s partial arms embargo, which wrongly withheld a number of weapons and ammunition from Israel, is yet another sign that Israel has no greater ally in the White House than President Trump.' By contrast, Rubio said the current administration has lifted Biden-era restrictions on military equipment transfers and accelerated shipments to the Jewish state. 'Since taking office, the Trump Administration has approved nearly $12 billion in major FMS sales to Israel. This important decision coincides with President Trump’s repeal of a Biden-era memorandum which had imposed baseless and politicized conditions on military assistance to Israel at a time when our close ally was fighting a war of survival on multiple fronts against Iran and terror proxies.' 'The Trump Administration will continue to use all available tools to fulfill America’s long-standing commitment to Israel’s security, including means to counter security threats.' On Friday, the Pentagon announced it had received a green light from the State Department to sell over $2 billion-worth of heavy munitions to Israel, including tens of thousands of the MK-84 bombs subject to the Biden administration’s ban. The State Department said it granted emergency waivers to the congressional review process, fast-tracking the sale of 35,529 bombs requested by Israel – including MK-84s and BLU-117 general purpose bombs, along with 4,000 I-2000 Penetrator warheads.

Prosecutors refuse to delay trial for active reservist in minor c...	The prosecutor in the case is acting as if I were a murderer,' says reservist in special forces unit, charged with minor offense over a building code violation. By World Israel News Staff An active-duty reservist in the military is battling to have a hearing for a minor criminal case postponed, after the prosecution has refused to delay his trial. A, who was identified in Hebrew-language outlet Ynet only by his first initial, has been serving continuously in a special-forces unit for the last eight months. The reservist, who lives in the Sharon region, told Ynet that he is currently being charged with unlawful use of a building, a minor offense under Israeli law. Prosecutors allege that the reservist, who in his civilian life works in his family business growing and selling produce, illegally converted an old greenhouse into a warehouse for his agricultural products. 'It's a minor offense, but the state decided to file an indictment,' A told Ynet. 'Due to my service, the hearings were postponed. We recently filed a request for another postponement because I'm still on active duty,' A said, but the request was denied. 'The prosecutor in the case is acting as if I were a murderer,' A continued. 'I'm not avoiding anything. When I finish my time in the reserves, I'll happily come to court,' he said. A told the outlet that over the last year, he has barely seen his wife or two young daughters, ages eight and four. Additionally, his elderly father, who is now responsible for the business, has been struggling with his workload. 'It's very frustrating that I'm serving the state, risking my life, my family is being harmed, my business is being harmed, and the state - excuse the expression - is screwing with my head,' A said. In a statement to Ynet, the Netanya prosecutor's office confirmed that it had refused to postpone the hearing again. But, they claimed, they had offered that the hearing be held only in the presence of A's lawyer, without requiring him to attend. The prosecution added that they are now demanding a letter from A's unit that states he cannot be released from the reserves for one day to attend court.

Israel halts Gaza aid after ceasefire lapses	IDF eliminates Gaza terrorist and freezes entry of aid into the Gaza Strip after ceasefire deal lapses with no progress towards new arrangement for freeing remaining hostages. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel froze the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip over the weekend, after the ceasefire deal with the Hamas terror organization lapsed with no replacement arrangement in place to continue the release of Israeli hostages. Over the weekend, the six-week first phase of the January 19th ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas ended, marking the first Saturday since the deal was signed without the transfer of any hostages from Gaza to Israel. Talks between Israel and Hamas remain deadlocked, after Israel agreed to accept an American proposal to extend the current ceasefire through April 19th, spanning the Ramadan and Passover holidays. Under the American plan, Hamas would be required to free half of the remaining 63 hostages, both living and deceased, on day one of the extended ceasefire, with the remaining half to be freed at the end of the ceasefire. Hamas, however, has thus far refused to accept the U.S. proposal, demanding instead that Israel conclude negotiations with the terror group for implementing the second phase of the January 19th ceasefire, as laid out by President Joe Biden in May 2024. The proposed second phase would include a far more comprehensive agreement than either the expired first phase or the American proposal for an extension, and would include an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. On Sunday morning, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced that given Hamas' refusal to continue releasing Israeli hostages or to accept the U.S. proposal, Israel has halted the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip. 'With the conclusion of the first stage of the hostages deal and in light of Hamas's refusal to accept the Witkoff framework for the continuation of the talks, to which Israel has agreed, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, the entry of all goods and supplies to the Gaza Strip will be halted,' the Prime Minister's Office announced. 'Israel will not allow a ceasefire without a release of our hostages. If Hamas persists in its refusal, there will be additional consequences.' Following the lapse of the ceasefire Sunday morning, IDF forces conducted a drone strike in northern Gaza, killing a terrorist in Beit Hanoun. Arabic media outlets reported one dead and several injured in the attack.

Trump to meet freed hostage Eli Sharabi in Washington	Hostage who Trump noted looked like a 'Holocaust survivor' to meet with the president in Washington on Tuesday. By World Israel News Staff Several recently freed hostages, including Eli Sharabi, will meet with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, Sharabi's brother Sharon told Hebrew-language outlet Channel 12 News. Eli Sharabi was released in early February, alongside Or Levy and Ohad Ben-Ami, all of whom appeared frail and gaunt. Trump said that Sharabi and his fellow captives released that day 'looked like Holocaust survivors' due to the starvation they had endured. Sharabi, 53, was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7th, 2023. He lost more than 40 percent of his body weight during his time in captivity. His British-born wife Lianne, 48, and their two daughters, Noiya, 16, and Yahel, 13, who also held UK citizenship, were murdered. According to media reports, the bodies of the mother and daughters were discovered 'in an embrace.' In a post-release interview with Israeli news program Uvda, Sharabi described long-term starvation, including days subsisting on a single plate of pasta. He described being beaten and psychologically and physically tortured by his captors. Held mostly in tunnels for 15 months, Sharabi had no idea that his family was slaughtered until he was freed. 'Survivors of Hamas captivity, including my brother Eli, will meet Trump in Washington on Tuesday and explain to him in the most direct way possible the urgency of returning all the hostages,' Sharon Sharabi told Channel 12 News. He added that 'Trump had watched excerpts from Eli's Uvda interview with with English subtitles.' A third brother, Yossi Sharabi, was also abducted on October 7th from Kibbutz Be'eri. The IDF declared him to be dead in captivity several weeks after his kidnapping. Sharon Sharabi said that the trip was made possible by the 'generosity' of Miriam Adelson. Israel-born Adelson is the widow of billionaire philanthropist Sheldon Adelson. A close personal friend of Trump, Adelson has engaged intensified her Israel advocacy efforts following the October 7th terror onslaught.

Hostage’s family recognizes him in Hamas propaganda video	Nirmod Cohen, who was abducted from a tank on October 7th, seen alive and hugging now-free hosage Yair Horn in Hamas video. By World Israel News Staff The family of kidnapped Israeli soldier Nimrod Cohen recognized him in a propaganda video released by the Hamas over the weekend, the despite the terror group trying to disguise his identity. On Saturday, Hamas published a video of brothers Yair and Eitan Horn tearfully saying goodbye to each other, as Yair was set to be released and Eitan was to remain in Hamas captivity. Yair Horn was returned to Israel in mid-February, and has since advocated publicly for the return of his brother and the other hostages. In the video, several other captives can be seen, but their faces were blurred out by the terror group, presumably to cause further psychological torment to the hostages' families. Cohen's family told Hebrew-language media outlets that they could positively identify Nimrod, who is seen hugging Horn as he leaves, by a distinctive tattoo on his forearm, which Hamas did not blur out. 'My son Nimrod is a soldier who was kidnapped from a burning tank. He is alive, and he and all the kidnapped people are crying out to us from the inferno to save them now. All of them, and in one fell swoop,' Cohen told activists at a Tel Aviv protest on Saturday evening. Cohen, who has been extremely critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, urged President Donald Trump to ensure that the hostage deal continues. The father accused Netanyahu of 'dragging his feet' regarding stage two of the ceasefire agreement, which would see an official end to the war and complete IDF withdrawal from the Strip. Hamas has signaled that it is not interested in prolonging the first phase of the deal. The truce officially ended on Sunday, though it's unclear if either side will quickly return to fighting.

Israel backs new US ceasefire plan, Hamas silent	Under the terms of the agreement, half of the hostages, both living and deceased, are to be released on the first day of the ceasefire’s implementation. By World Israel News Israel has formally agreed to a temporary ceasefire proposed by US envoy Steve Witkoff, set to last through Ramadan and Passover, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office. The decision was reached following an extensive four-hour security meeting led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which was also attended by Defense Minister Israel Katz, senior defense officials, and the Israeli negotiating team. Under the terms of the agreement, half of the hostages, both living and deceased, are to be released on the first day of the ceasefire’s implementation. The remaining hostages will be freed at the conclusion of the ceasefire period, provided a permanent ceasefire agreement is successfully negotiated. However, Hamas has not yet accepted this framework. The Israeli government has made it clear that if Hamas agrees, Israel is prepared to enter immediate negotiations to finalize the specifics of the plan. The proposal was introduced by Witkoff based on the understanding that, at present, there is no viable path to reconciling the fundamental disagreements between Israel and Hamas regarding the war’s resolution. The ceasefire is intended to create additional time for negotiations aimed at securing a more lasting agreement. Despite previous violations of the ceasefire by Hamas, Israel asserts that it has upheld its obligations under the agreement. The current ceasefire framework stipulates that if negotiations fail to yield progress within 42 days, Israel retains the right to resume military operations. This provision, as emphasized by the Prime Minister’s Office, is backed by a letter from the previous US administration and enjoys the support of the Trump administration. The security meeting that led to the adoption of Witkoff’s proposal coincided with the expiration of the initial ceasefire deal. With Ramadan running until March 29 and Passover concluding on April 19, the newly proposed ceasefire is designed to cover both religious observances. While Israel has not issued a direct threat of renewed hostilities, the agreement does allow for a resumption of fighting at any moment should negotiations prove unsuccessful. Israel has reiterated that its acceptance of this proposal is driven by the urgent need to secure the release of hostages still held by Hamas. If Hamas remains unwilling to accept the plan, the current ceasefire framework may lapse without further negotiations, potentially leading to renewed conflict.

Jared and Ivanka refuse to defend Trump after he criticized Netan...	Then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'deserved blame' for Hamas's invasion. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner refused to defend Donald Trump after he criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following Hamas's invasion of Israel on October 7, according to a book by journalist Michael Wolff. Wolff’s book, All or Nothing, released this week, offers an inside look at Trump’s 2024 campaign, detailing its dramatic transformation from the aftermath of the January 6th turmoil to a eventual election victory. Following Trump's criticism of Netanyahu and Israeli officials, some in Trump's inner circle asked Jared and Ivanka to issue a statement defending Trump against accusations of antisemitism and faltering support of Israel. The couple flatly refused, according to the book, and Kushner said, 'No, Ivanka and I aren’t going to do that. 'We’re not going to put our name on something and get in the middle of things. That’s just not what we’re going to do this time.' Then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'deserved blame' for the Hamas invasion, but added that if elected, he would strive to protect Israel. In an interview with Time magazine, Trump criticized Netanyahu and noted that October 7th 'happened on his watch.' Speaking of Israel, Trump said, 'They have the most sophisticated equipment.' He added, 'They had—everything was there to stop that. And a lot of people knew about it, you know, thousands and thousands of people knew about it, but Israel didn’t know about it, and I think he’s being blamed for that very strongly, being blamed.' In a speech Trump made on October 11 2023, he said Netanyahu 'was not prepared and Israel was not prepared.' He added, 'Thousands of people knew about it and they let this slip by. ' It was also on October 11 that Trump recounted an anecdote that Netanyahu allegedly pulled out of a plan to kill Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leader Qassam Soleimani in January 2020. In the interview, Trump refers to this alleged incident as a 'bad experience' with Netanyahu. He said, 'All of a sudden, we were told that Israel was not doing it. And I was not happy about that. That was something I never forgot. And it showed me something.'

Smotrich warns ‘rivers of blood’ could result from hostage deal	For every day the hostages remain captive, we annex 5% of Gaza's territory.' By World Israel News Staff: Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich defended his opposition to the hostage-for-prisoners release deal, stating that the agreement could lead to 'rivers of blood.' Smotrich told Israel HaYom, 'I am relieved for every hostage who returns, but this deal is deeply flawed, and the price is too high. You will see — we will all grieve later,' he said. 'Everyone focuses on the emotional reunions of families, but forgets about the families of those whose loved ones' murderers are being freed,' he added. 'Even more concerning is that we don't consider those who may become the next victims when terrorists with blood on their hands return to terror,' Smotrich said. 'This deal could result in rivers of blood.' Smotrich proposed annexing Gaza as a way to pressure Hamas into releasing the captives. 'Rather than paying in blood and releasing terrorists, we should establish a new approach – for every day the hostages remain captive, we annex 5% of Gaza's territory,' Smotrich proposed. In early February, Smotrich outlined this plan to put pressure on Hamas at a conference on the integration of the ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) population. 'We need to set an ultimatum for Hamas,' Smotrich said, a day after Trump issued his own ultimatum, demanding the terror group release all Israeli hostages still in captivity by Saturday at noon. 'Cut off their electricity and water and stop the humanitarian aid,' Smotrich said. 'We must open the gates of hell.' The minister further proposed that for every hostage harmed while in captivity, Israel would annex 5% of the Gaza Strip – a position he claimed to have the backing of President Donald Trump. 'For each hostage that something happens to, on that same day, we will annex 5% of the Gaza Strip. We have the full backing of President Trump,' he said. Additionally, Smotrich called on the IDF to actively search for and arrest every Palestinian terrorist freed as part of the deal with Hamas.

Lebanon seizes $2.5 million destined for Hezbollah	One of the sources noted that it was the first time such a confiscation took place. By JNS Lebanon on Friday arrested a man arriving from Turkey with $2.5 million in cash bound for Hezbollah, the Lebanese Finance Ministry said. 'The detainee and the seized funds will be handed over to the investigation division at the General Directorate of General Security,' the ministry said in a statement, not mentioning Hezbollah. Three sources with knowledge of the matter were cited by Reuters as saying that the cash was destined for the Iranian-backed terrorist group. One of the sources noted that it was the first time such a confiscation took place. Hezbollah was significantly weakened in its latest war with Israel, which saw its leadership slain in precise airstrikes and thousands of its operatives wounded in the remarkable communications-explosions campaign carried out by Israel’s intelligence community. Media outlets have reported that its political influence in the country, as well as its financial resources, have waned as it struggles to rebuild its strength. According to the ceasefire terms agreed on by Israel and Lebanon, the Lebanese Armed Forces are to deploy to Southern Lebanon and ensure the disarmament of Hezbollah south of the Litani River. This has taken place in part only, and so the IDF has remained in five posts over the border to prevent attacks on Israeli communities near the frontier. Last month, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar accused Ankara of assisting Iran in funneling funds to Hezbollah in Lebanon. During a meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem with a bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators, which included seven senators and Deputy Middle East Special Envoy Morgan Ortagus, Sa’ar warned that Tehran has intensified its efforts to finance Hezbollah, with the active involvement of Turkey. 'There is an increased Iranian effort to smuggle money to Lebanon for Hezbollah in order to restore its power and status, including via Turkey and through its cooperation,' said Sa’ar. Allegations of cash transfers to Hezbollah and the threat of an Israeli strike on Beirut’s airport prompted the suspension of flights between Iran and Lebanon, drawing a sharp response from the Shi’ite terrorist group, which dispatched operatives to riot outside the airport. UNIFIL personnel were attacked during the protest. Israel’s Channel 14 reported on Tuesday that it is believed that tens of millions of dollars have already reached Hezbollah through Turkey. Iran is also exploring other smuggling routes to fund its Lebanese terror proxy.

Netanyahu instructs IDF to protect Syrian village under attack	We will not permit the radical Islamic regime in Syria to harm the Druze.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the IDF to prepare itself to defend a Druze village in Syria that is under attack. 'We will not permit the radical Islamic regime in Syria to harm the Druze,' they stated. 'If the regime targets the Druze, it will face consequences from us.' 'We are dedicated to our Druze brothers in Israel and will take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of their Druze brethren in Syria.' The Druze village under attack is Jaramana, located on the outskirts of Damascus. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the demilitarization of southern Syria and the protection of its Druze community, marking his first public call for such measures since the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime in December. 'We demand the complete demilitarization of southern Syria,' Netanyahu said during an officer cadet graduation ceremony in Beer-Sheva. 'We will not tolerate any threats to the Druze community in southern Syria.' Shortly after the regime change, Israeli security officials enlisted senior Druze leaders from Israel to help foster connections with Druze communities in Syria. In December, Maj.-Gen. Shlomi Bender, the head of the Israeli army’s Intelligence Directorate, met with Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of Israel’s Druze community, according to Lt.-Col. Avichay Adraee, the IDF’s Arabic spokesperson. Adraee tweeted, 'The head of the Intelligence Service and His Eminence Sheikh Tarif discussed the developments in Syria and their impact on the Druze community.'

Hamas refuses to extend truce and release more hostages, demands ...	Israel’s position remains focused on extending Phase 1 by several more weeks, during which hostages would be released in staggered groups of three to four individuals, depending on their medical condition. By Shachar Kleiman and Danny Zaken, JNS Hamas has refused to extend the first phase of the hostage agreement with Israel and is demanding an immediate transition to negotiations on Phase 2. In a statement, Hamas declared: 'With the completion of the first phase of the ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement, we reaffirm our full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement across all its stages and details.' The statement continued: 'We call on the international community to pressure Israel to fully commit to the agreement and immediately enter Phase 2.' Meanwhile, Israel is trying to extend the first phase of the agreement by an additional 42 days. Netanyahu calls urgent consultation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unusually summoned an urgent security consultation for Friday evening, following the return of the Israeli negotiation team from Cairo, earlier than expected. This comes amid reports from Egypt that the negotiations have stalled. According to the reports, Hamas has decided to reject discussions on extending phase one of the hostage deal and insists on talks that align with the framework for Phase 2, which includes an end to the war. The consultation is expected to include most members of the negotiation team, including Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, security agency chiefs, and other key figures. However, according to Israeli sources, Hamas has not completely ruled out extending Phase 1 and has even put forward demands for modifying the prisoner release formula for each hostage. In other words, Hamas is open to an extension but under stricter conditions. Yet, Israel does not appear willing to accommodate Hamas’s demands, maintaining the firm stance in the negotiations that has led to some gains in recent weeks. Israel’s position remains focused on extending Phase 1 by several more weeks, during which hostages would be released in staggered groups of three to four individuals, depending on their medical condition. Israel has reportedly demanded that the first release take place as early as Saturday in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners under the existing formula (30 terrorists for each civilian, and 50 for each soldier, that is men under age 50, which encompasses all remaining hostages believed to be alive), as well as allowing additional caravans and mechanical equipment for clearing debris to enter the Strip. Hamas, however, has reportedly not agreed to this. Mediators’ proposal: Hostage releases alongside talks on Phase 2 Israeli sources indicate that mediators have presented additional proposals, including a parallel move where staggered hostage releases would continue alongside discussions on the next phase, including the possibility of a ceasefire agreement extending until after Ramadan, which began on Friday evening. Hamas, which has declared its part of the deal completed, accuses Israel of violating the agreement by refusing to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Israeli leaders, including the prime minister and defense minister, have indeed stated that Israel has no intention of withdrawing from the corridor. The implication is that while Phase 1 has officially ended, and in theory, the ceasefire should also come to an end, Israeli assessments suggest that Hamas is highly reluctant to resume hostilities. This creates an opportunity to push Hamas toward agreeing to continued hostage releases while Israel simultaneously prepares for a possible resumption of fighting.

Israel has reportedly demanded that the first release take place as early as Saturday in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners under the existing formula (30 terrorists for each civilian, and 50 for each soldier, that is men under age 50, which encompasses all remaining hostages believed to be alive), as well as allowing additional caravans and mechanical equipment for clearing debris to enter the Strip. Hamas, however, has reportedly not agreed to this. Mediators’ proposal: Hostage releases alongside talks on Phase 2 Israeli sources indicate that mediators have presented additional proposals, including a parallel move where staggered hostage releases would continue alongside discussions on the next phase, including the possibility of a ceasefire agreement extending until after Ramadan, which began on Friday evening. Hamas, which has declared its part of the deal completed, accuses Israel of violating the agreement by refusing to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Israeli leaders, including the prime minister and defense minister, have indeed stated that Israel has no intention of withdrawing from the corridor. The implication is that while Phase 1 has officially ended, and in theory, the ceasefire should also come to an end, Israeli assessments suggest that Hamas is highly reluctant to resume hostilities. This creates an opportunity to push Hamas toward agreeing to continued hostage releases while Israel simultaneously prepares for a possible resumption of fighting.

US authorizes $2 billion sale of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel	U.S. President Donald Trump announced in January that he was overturning a Biden administration policy of refusing to sell 2,000-pound bombs to Israel over concerns that they contributed to civilian casualties in Gaza. By JNS The U.S. State Department announced on Friday that it authorized a $2.04 billion sale of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. 'The government of Israel has requested to buy 35,529 MK 84 or BLU-117 General Purpose bomb bodies, or a combination of both, and 4,000 I-2000 Penetrator warheads,' the department stated. 'The Secretary of State has determined and provided detailed justification that an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale to the government of Israel of the above defense articles and defense services in the national security interests of the United States, thereby waiving the congressional review,' the department stated. U.S. President Donald Trump announced in January that he was overturning a Biden administration policy of refusing to sell 2,000-pound bombs to Israel over concerns that they contributed to civilian casualties in Gaza. The weapons were previously at the center of a dispute between former president Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with Biden saying that the bombs were the only type of munition that he had denied to Israel and Netanyahu releasing a video on social media implying that Washington was slow-rolling broad categories of material. 'A lot of things that were ordered and paid for by Israel but have not been sent by Biden are now on their way,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Jan. 25. According to the State Department, delivery of the bombs is expected to begin in 2026.

Israel may allow Syrian Druze into the country for work	The plan follows requests from Druze living in Syria who wish to be reunited with their families and enjoy the protection of the Israeli government. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Defense Minister Israel Katz unveiled a plan on Thursday to allow Syrian Druze workers into Israel. Katz made the remarks at a conference for leaders of regional councils. 'The plan signals a 'strong commitment to our Druze friends in Syria,' ' Katz said, noting that Israeli leaders 'work hard to maintain contact with them.' 'We are currently exploring the possibility of allowing those nearby to come and work in the Golan Heights on a daily basis, and we are ready to support them through organizations and in various ways. Our goal is to ensure their protection, and we are working toward this thoughtfully,' he said. The plan follows requests from Druze living in Syria who wish to be reunited with their families and enjoy the protection of the Israeli government. If the plan is implemented, IDF soldiers will be responsible for monitoring border entrances and exits and securing the corridor. Katz described Israel's strategy of preventing Iran from rescuing Syria during the toppling of the previous regime. Israel was concerned that Iran, after 'saving Syria,' could have developed a foothold and established a military regime to rule the country. 'We sent clear messages to those who needed to hear them: if the Iranians come, we will strike. We deployed our Air Force aircraft, and they successfully turned back the Iranian planes,' Katz said. Despite Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa 'exchanging fatigues for suits and speaking well&#8230; We do not trust him. We only trust the IDF,' Katz said. 'It was clear to me and the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu] that we need to seize the border area – and our policy is to stay there, at the peak of Hermon, and in the controlling points, for an indefinite period.' Katz added that Israel must ensure that the south of Syria remains a demilitarized zone to keep Israel secure.

Freed hostage recounts abuse, gut-wrenching parting with captive ...	When Eli Sharabi received the news of his impending release on February 8, Alon Ohel clutched him and wouldn't let go until a guard forcibly separated them. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Released hostage Eli Sharabi recounts the abuses he suffered during his 16-month captivity and the devastation of having to leave fellow hostage Alon Ohel in Gaza. Sharabi recalls being starved to the point where he lost 40 percent of his body weight, beaten, and chained. He learned that his wife and daughters were murdered only after he was released and returned to Israel, although he said he is 'not angry.' The 53-year-old said that Hamas captors tormented him and other hostages more severely if they thought Palestinian prisoners were being treated badly. 'Ilana, do you know what it means to open the fridge?' Chilling testimony from released hostage Eli Sharabi on the starvation in Hamas captivity. pic.twitter.com/q9wfcKzlOS &mdash; Eli Kowaz - איליי קואז (@elikowaz) February 27, 2025 'You could tell what was happening in the news just by [the captors’] behavior,' Sharabi said, referring to the effect of remarks by politicians on their treatment by Hamas. 'Every irresponsible statement — we’re the first ones to suffer [the consequences],' he continued. 'They come to us and tell us, ‘They aren’t giving our prisoners food — you won’t eat. They’re beating our prisoners — we’ll beat you. They aren’t letting them shower — you won’t get to shower.'' Sharabi was held in a house with a Thai worker before being transferred to a tunnel, where he developed a close friendship with Alon Ohel, a hostage still in Gaza. Speaking of the 24-year-old, Sharabi said, 'I adopted him from the first minute. We were together 24/7. I know everything about him and his family.' He spoke of the torment they experienced upon learning that he would be released while Ohel would be left behind in Gaza. When Sharabi received the news of his impending release on February 8, Ohel clutched him and wouldn't let go until a guard forcibly separated them. Ohel then went into 'moments of hysteria' and needed 15 minutes to calm down. 'It was a very difficult moment,' he said. 'He said he was happy for me. I promised him I wouldn’t leave him there. I will fight for him.' Eliyahu Cohen was released two weeks later, leaving Ohel alone. 'I can’t imagine that moment,' Sharabi said, referring to Cohen's departure. 'I can’t imagine it.' Sharabi's experience has inspired him to advocate for the release of all the hostages. 'We cannot leave anyone behind,' he said.

Hamas sleeper cell plotted attack on Israeli embassy in Germany	The terrorists had ambitious targets in mind including the Israeli Embassy in Berlin, the US Air Base in Ramstein, and Berlin’s Tempelhof Airport. By Jewish Breaking News The long-awaited trial for four Hamas terrorists suspected of plotting attacks against high-profile targets across Germany has finally begun. 'For the first time in Germany, people are facing charges of participating as members of the foreign terrorist organization Hamas,' said prosecutor Jochen Weingarten at the start of the proceedings on Tuesday. Lebanese-born citizens, Ibrahim El-R, Abdelhamid Al A., along with Egyptian Mohamed B., and Dutch citizen Nazih R. spent years establishing and maintaining weapons caches across multiple countries. Their European residency permits made them invaluable to an organization seeking to spread global jihad. According to federal prosecutors, their mission began in spring 2019, when Ibrahim El-R. traveled to Bulgaria. There, he established a weapons depot stocked with ammunition and firearms, including a Kalashnikov rifle. Just months later, he cleared out another weapons cache in Denmark, bringing at least one pistol back to Germany. The weapons lay dormant for years. Then in August 2023, Ibrahim El-R. returned to Bulgaria just weeks before Hamas would attack Israel on October 7th. After war broke out in Gaza, Hamas leadership activated its European terror cell. Over the summer, the four suspects repeatedly traveled from Berlin searching for another weapons cache they believed was hidden somewhere in Poland, though they never located it. The terrorists had ambitious targets in mind including the Israeli Embassy in Berlin, the US Air Base in Ramstein, and Berlin’s Tempelhof Airport. Thankfully, their dreams of murdering innocent people were foiled when three of them were arrested in December 2023 on German soil while the fourth, Nazih R., was apprehended in the Netherlands and extradited in February 2024.

The scroll is covered in orange, the color that has become a symbol of the Bibas family and has a picture of them on it with an inscription from Eichah (Lamentations 2:19). By Jewish Breaking News In a deeply emotional ceremony today Yarden Bibas completed a Sefer Torah in memory of his wife, Shiri Bibas, and their two children, Ariel and Kfir, who were brutally murdered in Hamas captivity. The event was led by social activist Rabbi Shai Graucher, who received the Torah from The Palm Beach Synagogue, which was specially prepare in honor of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir for Yarden Bibas. Yarden Bibas was given the honor of writing the final three letters, embedding the love for his family into the sacred scroll. Yarden chose to place this Torah in the synagogue of Kibbutz Nir Oz, where both of his sons had their Brit Milah (circumcision ceremonies)—a location that once marked their beginning and now stands as a place of remembrance. The Torah, a symbol of eternal faith and continuity, now serves as a lasting tribute to the lives stolen too soon. On October 7, Hamas terrorists stormed Kibbutz Nir Oz, kidnapping Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel (4) and Kfir (9 months). Their abduction became one of the most well-known hostage cases, with haunting images of baby Kfir circulating worldwide as a symbol of innocence lost. The scroll is covered in orange, the color that has become a symbol of the Bibas family and has a picture of them on it with an inscription from Eichah (Lamentations 2:19): 'Pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord; lift up thy hands toward Him for the life of thy young children.' Even in unimaginable tragedy, the dedication of this Torah ensures that the memory of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas will live on forever in Jewish faith and history.

By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel authorities released 643 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists as part of the ceasefire agreement, the Israeli Prison Service confirmed on Thursday. Since January 19, Israel has freed 1,778 Palestinians in exchange for 33 hostages. The completion of Wednesday night’s exchange marks the end of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. The fate of the remaining 59 hostages is to be determined by negotiations. Critics say the phased approach condemns them to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 59 remaining hostages, 32 are believed to be dead.

Americans overwhelmingly support Israel’s right to defend itself,...	Among the 400 college students surveyed, 75 percent said they experienced, witnessed, or heard about anti-Semitic incidents on their campus, while 76 percent said they viewed it as a serious problem. By Jessica Costescu, The Washington Free Beacon An overwhelming majority of Americans support Israel’s right to defend itself, according to a poll released Thursday. The poll, conducted by the Israel on Campus Coalition in partnership with Schoen Cooperman Research, reveals a resounding endorsement of Israel’s position among Americans. Of the 1,000 U.S. adults surveyed, 81 percent affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself—an 11 percent increase compared to a poll the two groups conducted last month. Thursday’s survey also identified an even sharper increase: 82 percent of Americans believe a final ceasefire agreement in the Gaza conflict should remove Hamas from power, up from 57 percent last month. 'These findings demonstrate unwavering public support for Israel and deep concern about the alarming rise of antisemitism, especially on college campuses,' said Israel on Campus Coalition CEO Jacob Baime. While solidarity with Israel remains robust, the poll also highlighted the sharp increase in anti-Semitism present in America's colleges and universities. Since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre of Israeli civilians, reports of anti-Semitism in higher education skyrocketed. Among the 400 college students surveyed, 75 percent said they experienced, witnessed, or heard about anti-Semitic incidents on their campus, while 76 percent said they viewed it as a serious problem. Those findings were similar among the 250 Jewish college students polled. Of them, 74 percent see anti-Semitism as a serious problem on their campus, with 81 percent having either experienced it personally (30 percent), witnessed it firsthand (29 percent), or heard about anti-Semitic incidents (22 percent). The anti-Israel protests and Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions petitions that have spread on college campuses since the Oct. 7 attack have resonated with Jewish students. Nearly 90 percent worry that those activities are fueling hate crimes and violence against Jewish students. President Donald Trump pledged to target campus anti-Semitism during his 2024 election campaign and has started to make good on that promise. Universities have already taken measures in response. Just one week into his term, Trump signed an executive order announcing that the federal government would 'combat anti-Semitism vigorously, using all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.' Trump’s Department of Education, meanwhile, opened investigations into 'widespread antisemitic harassment' at Columbia University and four other schools in the wake of Oct. 7 and scrapped $15 million in federal grants for diversity programs at three other universities. The Department of Justice launched a task force 'to root out anti-Semitic harassment in schools and college campuses.' Still, the Israel-Hamas war looms large for college students, ranking as their second-most important issue (27 percent), trailing only costs and inflation (43 percent). For Jewish students, it’s the top priority (40 percent). Ninety-one percent of college students say the conflict is important to them personally.

Egypt rejects Israeli opposition leader’s ‘Egyptian solution’ for...	Trump called on Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab states to take in Palestinians from Gaza after nearly 16 months of war between Israel and Hamas. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Egypt has rejected any responsibility for governing the Gaza Strip after the Israel-Hamas war, reiterating its opposition to a proposal by Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, who suggested Cairo take over reconstruction efforts. 'Cairo rejects any proposal to manage the Gaza Strip,' the Saudi television channel Al-Hadath quoted sources as saying. 'Gaza will be managed by the Palestinians and in coordination with them. Cairo is committed to rebuilding Gaza without displacement.' At an event hosted by the Washington, DC-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) think tank on Tuesday, former Israeli Prime Minister Lapid, who currently serves as the leader of the opposition in Israel’s parliament, presented 'The Egyptian Solution' as his alternative plan for reconstruction efforts in Gaza after the war, proposing that Egypt take over administration of the enclave for 8-15 years in exchange for the cancellation of its $155 billion external debt. 'Egypt is a key strategic partner and [has been] a reliable ally for almost 50 years,' Lapid said. 'A strong, moderate, pragmatic Sunni state, a crucial player in the region.' According to the Egyptian state news agency MENA, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tamim Khalaf declared that any proposals contradicting Egypt and the Arab world’s established stance on Gaza are 'rejected and unacceptable,' asserting that the territory must be under 'full Palestinian sovereignty and management.' Cairo has also previously rejected US President Donald Trump’s plan to 'take over' the Gaza Strip to rebuild the war-torn enclave, while relocating Palestinians elsewhere during reconstruction efforts. Trump called on Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab states to take in Palestinians from Gaza after nearly 16 months of war between Israel and Hamas. Like many other Middle Eastern leaders who rejected Trump’s proposal, Egypt has advocated a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Lapid explained on Tuesday that his plan aims to strengthen Israel’s security in the south, which borders Gaza, by enabling reconstruction and administration without Hamas’s involvement, ultimately resulting in a complete 'divorce' from Gaza. 'Down the road, 10 years from now, the best solution is for Israel to separate from the Palestinians in a way that contributes to Israel’s security,' he said. Under Lapid’s plan, Egypt would be responsible for demilitarizing Gaza and stopping weapons smuggling during its control. In return, he proposed that the international community and regional allies pay off Egypt’s massive debt to support Gaza’s management and reconstruction. 'The situation whereby a terrorist organization controls a country or territory and leaves it for others to manage the civilian affairs – like Hezbollah in Lebanon – is unacceptable,' Lapid said. He added that Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the countries that normalized relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords could play a role in gradually integrating the Palestinian Authority into governing Gaza. 'But that must be done in coordination with Israel and the United States, and with a constant focus on Israel’s security needs,' he emphasized. Last week, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi met with leaders from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the UAE, and Qatar to discuss his country’s alternative to Trump’s plan and urged the global community to support rebuilding Gaza without displacing its residents. During a press conference in Madrid alongside Spain’s prime minister, the Egyptian president reiterated that the international community must support reconstruction efforts without displacing Palestinians. 'We stressed the importance of the international community adopting a plan to reconstruct the Gaza strip without displacing Palestinians — I repeat, without displacing Palestinians from their lands,' he said. On March 5, Egypt will host an emergency Arab summit to discuss what it described as 'dangerous' developments for Palestinians, according to a statement from the Egyptian foreign ministry. The statement also said the summit was being called in response to a Palestinian request.

Auschwitz museum confiscates hostage symbols deeming them ‘politi...	We explained it was for the hostages, but they said the yellow ribbon was a political symbol.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Members of a British tour group were shocked when staff at the Auschwitz Museum confiscated Israeli flags with hostage symbols because they were deemed 'political.' Personnel from the museum in Poland took the flags from members of the Bushey Synagogue in Hertfordshire. The museum allows visitors to bring national flags to the museum, but the addition of the yellow ribbon symbol associated with the effort to return hostages from Gaza violated the museum's rules concerning 'political' messaging. 'The group was really upset and couldn’t understand it,' said one of the visitors, Lawrence Bentley, 76. 'It is really bad in this day and age.' Although security guards had allowed visitors to bring Israeli flags on earlier visits, the British group was stopped because of the hostage symbols on the flags. 'We explained it was for the hostages, but they said the yellow ribbon was a political symbol,' Bentley said. A senior security officer was called over. 'He told us, ‘My hands are tied. It is a political statement, and that is it.’' At one point, group members huddled together and sang Israeli songs while surreptitiously holding the flags with the hostage symbols, then hiding them when museum personnel approached. The group lit candles for hostages, read their names aloud, and said prayers. 'We have been saying ‘never again,’ and here we are again, with people committing crimes against Jews and Israelis, just as the Nazis did throughout Europe,' Bentley added. 'That’s why we had to remember the hostages during our visit.' A spokesman for the Auschwitz Museum told JC, 'Visitors to the Auschwitz Memorial are allowed to bring national flags; however, they must not be altered in any way, such as by adding slogans, symbols, or other modifications.' 'Any altered flag is no longer considered a national flag and does not comply with the Memorial's regulations. All visitors agree to these guidelines upon purchasing an entry ticket.' 'These regulations have been in place for many years to prevent any attempts to use the Memorial for activities unrelated to its history, which could be perceived as disrespectful to the victims of the German Nazi camp or as an attempt to instrumentalize their suffering in any way. These rules apply to all visitors, regardless of intent or good faith,' the spokesman said.

Israel to resume war in Gaza and ‘eradicate Hamas,’ cutting off a...	The plan starts with a wave of airstrikes on Gaza and a reduction of humanitarian aid to Gaza, the sources said. By Andrew Tobin, The Washington Free Beacon Israeli decision-makers plan to resume the Gaza war in four to six weeks with overwhelming force, sending in tens of thousands of troops to conquer the entire strip in a single coordinated offensive against Hamas. Incoming military chief of staff Eyal Zamir has, at the direction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, started developing the plan, according to several current and former Israeli officials with knowledge of high-level discussions. Under the plan, Israel will deploy more troops to Gaza than it has to this point in the war—over 50,000—before relocating the civilian population to humanitarian zones and waging a ruthless ground campaign against Palestinian terrorists across the rest of the strip. 'We’re going to see four to five divisions simultaneously attack in the north, in the center, and in the south, to occupy every area and clear out the enemy,' said Hezi Nehama, a former Israeli colonel who co-authored the Generals’ Plan, an influential proposal for a staged siege of Gaza. 'It will look different than what we saw in the war until now.' 'It’s going to be decisive,' said Amir Avivi, a former Israeli brigadier general who has advised the Israeli government and military during the war. 'Israel will use every tool it has to conquer Gaza and eradicate Hamas.' The plan starts with a wave of airstrikes on Gaza and a reduction of humanitarian aid to Gaza, the sources said. 'There will be no aid outside the humanitarian zones,' said Kobi Michael, a former head of the Palestinian desk at the Israel’s Strategic Affairs Ministry and before that a senior Israeli military intelligence official. 'This will prevent Hamas from continuing to steal all the humanitarian aid and will increase pressure on the group through the local population.' Nehama said Israel plans to expand an existing humanitarian zone in Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza into a single giant refuge. Other sources said there would be several humanitarian zones. The Israeli military raised its alert and readiness level along the Gaza border on Sunday, and Hamas has also reportedly started making preparations for renewed fighting. Zamir, the incoming military chief of staff, estimates that the plan, which he will present to Netanyahu and Katz after taking office next Thursday, can be completed in six months or less, according to Nehama. The plan could be paused if Hamas agrees to release more of the 59 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, 35 of them confirmed dead, or to disarm and leave Gaza in exchange for an end to the war, the sources said. However Israeli decision-makers do not believe Hamas is ready to make such compromises. Israel’s plan to resume the war comes on the heels of a string of military and diplomatic successes that leave the Jewish state less constrained than at any previous point in the past 17 months of war. Hezbollah agreed in November to a humiliating ceasefire with Israel, easing pressure on Israel’s overstretched army. 'We always had divisions in the north, and now we don’t need divisions in the north because Hezbollah is not a threat,' said Nehama. 'So we can take those divisions and put them all in Gaza at the same time, and this is very important.' In January, President Donald Trump took office and began reversing former president Joe Biden’s efforts to restrain Israel and accommodate its genocidal enemies. Trump has aligned more closely with Israel against Hezbollah and Iran and ended Biden’s restrictions on U.S. military aid to the Jewish state. In Gaza, meanwhile, Trump has taken an even harder line than Netanyahu, pushing the prime minister to resume the war with Hamas and resettle Gazans abroad. During Netanyahu’s visit to the White House earlier this month, Trump told the prime minister to 'do whatever you need to do' to defeat Hamas, according to an Israeli military official who described the meeting on condition of anonymity. But, the official said, Trump gave Netanyahu just 150 days to finish the job. Israel’s government, meanwhile, has replaced a number of top security officials who resisted deeper involvement in Gaza, including former defense minister Yoav Gallant and outgoing military chief of staff Herzi Halevi, with generals who are considered more hawkish. An Israeli government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that in recent cabinet meetings, ministers have 'completely rejected' Halevi’s approach to Gaza and accused him of 'doing everything he can to prevent victory in the war.' 'Behind the scenes, there are discussions with Zamir, which are much more constructive,' the official said. 'We hope to see him take leadership of the military and execute his plans.' In a meeting earlier this month with Netanyahu, Katz and Yaron Finkelman, the head of Israel’s Southern Command, Zamir rejected Halevi’s latest proposal for the Gaza war as too timid, according to Nehama and another former Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'The next chief of staff didn’t like what he heard,' Nehama said. 'He told the prime minister and the defense minister that he would present them with another plan, much more aggressive and decisive with many more troops involved.' In recent days, Israeli decision-makers have alluded to Zamir’s plan in public remarks. 'We are ready to return at any moment to intensive combat. The operational plans are ready,' Netanyahu said at a graduation ceremony for Israeli military cadets on Sunday. 'All of our hostages, without exception, will return home. Hamas won’t rule Gaza. Gaza will be demilitarized, and its fighting force will be dismantled.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich suggested at an event on Tuesday that Israel’s return to war was just a matter of time. 'We are preparing, gaining capabilities, and when we feel we are ready, we will open the gates of hell on Hamas again,' he declared at a conference in Jerusalem. 'It requires patience, but in the end we will bring about the desired outcome.' The sources said that Zamir’s plan does not directly deal with the 'day after' the war in Gaza. But they agreed that Israeli decision-makers are taking Trump’s call for mass resettlement of Gazans seriously despite international opposition to the idea. Ohad Tal, a member of Israel’s parliamentary defense from Smotrich’s Religious Zionism party, said that 'at the end of the day, Zamir’s plan is aligned with the government’s commitment to the Trump plan.' 'Removing the people of Gaza is the only solution that can really change the reality and create a better life for everybody,' Tal said. 'So everything we are doing in Gaza should serve that goal.'

By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner A major contender in the New York City (NYC) mayoral race has an extensive anti-Israel track record, raising concerns among the Big Apple’s Jewish population that the city’s staunch support of the Jewish State may be in jeopardy. Zohran Mamdani, a representative within the New York State Assembly and candidate for New York City mayor, has made anti-Israel activism a cornerstone of his political career. Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, has both advanced state legislation seeking to punish Israel and has labeled the Jewish state’s defensive military operations in Gaza a 'genocide.' According to a poll conducted by Honan Strategy Group from Feb. 22-23, Mamdani currently sits in second place in the NYC mayoral race, polling at 12 percent. Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo holds a commanding lead at 38 percent. In 2021, Mamdani issued public support for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement—an initiative which seeks to economically and diplomatically isolate Israel in the first step to its eventual destruction. He claimed that support for the anti-Israel movement is growing within New York City, saying on X/Twitter that 'The tide is turning. The fight for justice is here. The moment is now.' That same year, he also called for prohibiting New York lawmakers from visiting Israel, asserting that 'every elected [official] must be pressured to stand with Palestinians.' In May 2023, Mamdani advanced the 'Not on our dime!: Ending New York Funding of Israeli Settler Violence Act,' legislation which would ban charities from using tax-deductible donations to aid organizations that work in Judea and Samaria. Mamdani argued that the legislation would help the state fight against so-called Israeli 'war crimes' against Palestinians. The socialist dismissed critics of the legislation, saying that his anti-Israel proposal is '​​in line with the sentiments of most New Yorkers.' On Oct. 8, 2023, 24 hours following the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, Mamdani published a statement condemning 'Netanyahu’s declaration of war' and suggesting that Israel would use the terror attacks to justify committing a second 'Nakba.' Mamdani then said that Israel can only secure its long term safety by 'ending the occupation and dismantling apartheid.' Five days later, he further criticized Israel’s response to the Hamas-led massacres, saying that 'we are on the brink of a genocide of Palestinians in Gaza right now.' In January 2024, he called on NYC to cease sending funds to Israel, saying that 'Voters oppose their tax dollars funding a genocide.' The progressive firebrand is also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), a far-left political organization with critical views of Israel. Though the DSA has long opposed Israel, the organization has ramped up its pro-Hamas rhetoric during the ongoing war in Gaza. On Oct. 7, the organization issued a statement saying that Hamas’ massacre was 'a direct result of Israel’s apartheid regime.' The organization also encouraged its followers to attend an Oct. 8 'All Out for Palestine' event in Manhattan. In January 2024, the DSA issued a statement calling for an 'end to diplomatic and military support of Israel.' Then in April, the organization’s international committee, DSA IC, issued a missive defending Iran’s right to 'self-defense' against Israel. In addition, the socialist group slammed former US Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) over his vote in favor of replenishing Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system. The organization has also issued public support of Hamas, calling the terrorist group a 'resistance' and 'armed struggle' against Israel. In March 2024, the organization publicly repudiated progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), after the lawmaker condemned Hamas, arguing that Palestinians have a 'right to defend against occupation.' Mamdani’s political ascendance comes amid a spike in anti-Jewish hate crimes within New York City. New York City has been ravaged by a surge in antisemitic incidents in the 16 months following Oct. 7. According to NYPD data, Jews accounted for a majority of all hate crimes in the city. Pro-Hamas activists have held raucous—and sometimes violent—protests on the city’s college campuses, oftentimes causing Jewish students to fear for their safety. NYC schools are also currently facing criticism for failing to protect Jewish and Israeli students from antisemitism.

Support for Hamas plummets among Gazans, doubts over its governan...	According to ISEP’s recent poll, 67.9% of Gazans credit US President Donald Trump for the success of the ceasefire deal, with Qatar following behind. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Support for Hamas has dropped sharply among Gazans, with most rejecting its rule and questioning its ability to govern post-war, as tensions rise and efforts continue for the second phase of the ceasefire agreement, according to a new poll. The Institute for Social and Economic Progress (ISEP), an independent research institute, conducted a representative poll in Gaza on January 22, revealing that only 6% of Gazans prefer Hamas to rule post-war, while just 5.3% would vote for the group in future elections. As perception of Hamas in the Gaza Strip remains negative, the survey found that 70% of respondents believe the terrorist group lacks the ability to govern, and only 12.4% expect it to remain in power post-war. Meanwhile, Gazans have shown increased support for Fatah rule, the Palestinian Authority (PA)’s ruling party, after the ceasefire, with 60% favoring its leadership. In a survey last year by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR), 57% of respondents predicted that the Gaza Strip would come under Hamas’ control after the war. When asked about their preference for governance, 58% favored Hamas’ return, while only 20% supported the Palestinian Authority. Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists started the war in Gaza when they murdered 1,200 people and kidnapped 251 hostages during their invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel responded with a military campaign aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities in neighboring Gaza. Last month, both sides reached a ceasefire and hostage-release deal brokered by the US, Egypt, and Qatar. According to ISEP’s recent poll, 67.9% of Gazans credit US President Donald Trump for the success of the ceasefire deal, with Qatar following behind. Most respondents also believe the ceasefire will hold and lead to reconstruction efforts, with over 60% highly confident in its stability and another 30% considering it somewhat secure. Two in three (67.9%) respondents in the Gaza Strip credit Trump for the success of the ceasefire deal. Photo: Institute for Social and Economic Progress (ISEP) Under phase one of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas agreed to release 33 Israeli hostages, including eight who are deceased, in exchange for Israel freeing over 1,900 Palestinian prisoners, many serving multiple life sentences for terrorism-related offenses, and withdrawing troops from some positions in Gaza. So far, 29 Israeli hostages – plus five Thais – have been released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, with the bodies of four more hostages, initially due to be handed over on Thursday, still to come. The initial phase of the ceasefire deal is set to end on Saturday, while negotiations for the second phase, aimed at securing the release of remaining hostages and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, are ongoing. ISEP’s survey found that 89% of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip lack the means to rebuild their lives after the war. Housing support was cited as the most helpful form of aid, with one in three also emphasizing that housing and shelter should be the priority of reconstruction efforts. After the war, Gaza’s future remains uncertain, but Israel has ruled out any role for Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. Meanwhile, Hamas says it does not necessarily need to stay in power but insists on being consulted. With the exception of Israel, most Arab states have rejected Trump’s plan to 'take over' Gaza to rebuild the war-torn enclave, while relocating Palestinians elsewhere during reconstruction efforts. Trump has called on Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab states to take in Palestinians from Gaza after nearly 16 months of war between Israel and Hamas. Middle Eastern leaders, expected to bear much of the financial burden of rebuilding Gaza, have struggled to propose their own plan but insist on a role for the Palestinian Authority, while also advocating for a two-state solution. This week, former Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid, now the opposition leader in Israel’s parliament, proposed 'The Egyptian Solution' as his alternative plan for Gaza’s reconstruction after the war. The proposal, which suggested Egypt administer Gaza for 8-15 years in exchange for canceling its $155 billion external debt, was rejected by Cairo.

Turkey: Israel’s next big threat?	Are we indeed facing a Turkish-Israeli confrontation, as the Nagel Committee suggests? Could Erdoğan’s warnings materialize in the foreseeable future? By Itay Ilnai, JNS 'Recent events in our region, especially in Syria, remind us of an important fact: Turkey is bigger than Turkey itself,' President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in a speech at the Turkish Academy of Sciences on Dec. 18. The Turkish president’s words should be read against the backdrop of the balance of terror between his country and Israel, which have long maintained a love-hate relationship, receiving a significant twist in the wake of the current war. This has intensified even further following the fall of the Assad regime and the establishment of the new government in Damascus, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has enjoyed long-standing support from Ankara. This is reflected, among other things, in the recommendations of the Nagel Committee, which were submitted to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month. Although the committee was meant to examine the defense budget, its final report refers to the 'Turkish threat' in razor-sharp words. 'Israel may find itself facing a new threat that will emerge in Syria, which in some respects will be no less severe than the previous one,' it states. 'The problem will be exacerbated if the Syrian force effectively becomes a Turkish proxy, as part of Turkey’s dream of restoring the Ottoman crown to its former glory. The presence of Turkish proxies, or Turkish forces, in Syria could deepen the danger of a direct Turkish-Israeli confrontation.' The last words need to be read again: The Nagel Committee warns the prime minister of a 'direct Turkish-Israeli confrontation,' no less, and calls on him to adopt a 'completely different approach of ‘zero containment’' toward Syria, which otherwise could fall like ripe fruit into the hands of Erdoğan’s military forces. 'We must take into account that the entry of the Turkish army into Syria could lead to Syria’s rearmament at a relatively high speed,' the report states. The Turkish vision awakens The Nagel Report is the exception that proves the rule: So far, the change in Israel’s approach to Ankara has remained largely under the radar. The political and security establishment in Israel is not interested in irritating the Turkish giant and is careful not to offend it. On the Turkish side, however, they are doing the opposite. As if to breathe life into the bonfire of Israeli concerns, on Feb. 4, exactly one month after the report’s publication, the new Syrian president traveled to Ankara, where he met with Erdoğan at the opulent Presidential Palace. Reports in the media surrounding the historic meeting claimed that the two leaders were already set to discuss the signing of a joint defense agreement between Turkey and Syria, including the establishment of two Turkish air bases in central Syria and the training of the Syrian army. In American English, this is called 'boots on the ground.' There is also an escalating rhetoric from the Anatolian nation and its leader. 'Turkey can invade Israel as it did in Karabakh [in Azerbaijan] and Libya,' Erdoğan threatened last July, during a meeting of his Justice and Development Party. Even before that, he likened Netanyahu to Hitler, and claimed that the Israel Defense Forces is committing crimes against humanity in Gaza, for which he said the Israeli leadership should be 'brought to justice.' On that occasion, Erdoğan, who sees himself as a regional and to some extent religious leader, called on 'the entire Muslim world' to mobilize in the struggle against Israel. A military confrontation? Are we indeed facing a Turkish-Israeli confrontation, as the Nagel Committee suggests? Could Erdoğan’s warnings materialize in the foreseeable future? Turkey experts who spoke with Israel Hayom assess that in the wake of the war against Hamas and Hezbollah and what appears to be the weakening of the Shi’ite axis led by Iran, it is certainly possible that Israel is moving toward a new era, in which military confrontation between it and Turkey becomes a practical possibility. To this, of course, one must add the rise of the new regime in Damascus, a regime that is largely a proxy of Erdoğan, which will allow Turkey to establish an overland bridge between it and Israel and to place, indirectly or directly, a military force right on its doorstep. If the confrontation between Israel and Iran has marked recent decades, it is not inconceivable that we are now on the brink of an Israel-Turkey war. 'The moment the Turks have the ability to reach us on foot, it’s significant,' said Dr. Hay Eytan Cohen Yanarocak, a Turkey expert at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University. 'Already today, Turkey has almost unlimited access to northern Syria, and they are talking about paving roads, railways and infrastructure throughout Syria in the future. If this happens, then one day their ability to move military forces within Syria, on a large scale, will be significant. 'Israel needs to do everything not to turn Turkey into an active enemy, because Turkey is not Iran. It’s a stronger country, with a more sophisticated army, and a much more significant strategic location than Iran. Not someone you’d want to find yourself at war with,' he said. Noa Lazimi, a researcher at the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, added, 'Until now, Israel and Turkey have managed to maintain a certain degree of correct relations. Even after the Mavi Marmara flotilla episode in 2010, the countries knew how to rehabilitate their relations. 'However, during the current war, Erdoğan has intensified his attitude toward Israel, which may indicate his willingness to go further with his imperialist ideology, which also aligns with internal public opinion in Turkey. 'Recently, Erdoğan has proven that he is willing to risk what is right for his country for the sake of extreme ideology. On the other hand, Turkey is a member of NATO and has economic and security interests vis-à-vis the US, so I don’t think it would be wise for him to go all out against Israel in the short term,' she said. Fragile relations Since the Mavi Marmara events, Israel has been treading carefully to rehabilitate its relationship with Turkey. The diplomatic effort began to bear fruit in 2022, culminating in a meeting between President Isaac Herzog and his Turkish counterpart in Ankara. 'I hope this is a turning point,' Erdoğan said at the time. Shortly after, then-Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid also met with Erdoğan on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. 'And yet,' said a former senior official in the defense establishment, 'we have always had a very great suspicion toward Turkey.' This suspicion proved itself after the outbreak of the current Gaza war. In September 2023, Netanyahu and Erdoğan still managed to meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, declaring that 'our ties are strengthening.' However, a month later the war broke out, and the 'strengthening ties' ran aground: Turkey froze trade with Israel, the national airline Turkish Airlines stopped its flights to Ben-Gurion Airport to the dismay of many Israelis, and Erdoğan, as mentioned, compared Netanyahu to Hitler and threatened to invade Israel so that it could no longer use its army against the Palestinians, or anyone else. 'Who can guarantee that when they finish destroying Gaza, they won’t turn their gaze to Antalya?' the Turkish president wondered. All this happened while Turkey, which already has one of the largest and strongest armies in the Middle East, is increasingly strengthening militarily. In recent years, it has become a force to be reckoned with when it comes to offensive UAVs, developed ballistic missiles with a range of 2,000 km (1,242 miles) that can reach any point in Israel, and has even begun to seriously engage with the idea of establishing a nuclear program (ostensibly for civilian purposes). Meanwhile, Turkey supported Azerbaijan militarily in its war against Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, invaded Libya as part of the civil war, deepened its control in Cyprus, and effectively established a Turkish army in northern Syria, which fought against the Assad regime until its overthrow. 'Erdoğan is a leader with Islamist, neo-Ottoman aspirations, and he sought to brand Turkey as a military power to elevate its status to a country that can lead the Sunni Muslim world. On the ground, we see this in many arenas where the Turks are present today—Azerbaijan, Libya, Cyprus, and, of course, the deep involvement in Syria,' Lazimi said. The moves in Syria are the cornerstone of Erdoğan’s expansionist policy. ‘Turkey’s Security Paradigm’ In October 2021, Israeli Foreign Ministry official Shlomit Sofa, 'Yossi' from the Prime Minister’s Office, and Col. Uri from the IDF Intelligence Directorate published an article in the military journal Ma’arachot under the title 'Turkey’s Security Paradigm.' According to them, this paradigm 'has undergone substantial changes under Erdoğan’s rule … and it brings to expression the concept of political Islam from the school of the ‘Muslim Brotherhood.'' They contend that Ankara has adopted an 'active and assertive' approach based on political and military independence, and 'in Turkey’s view, Iran and Israel interfere with its plans and aspirations in the Syrian, Iraqi, Azerbaijani, Palestinian and other arenas.' Turkey, the article continues, is also expanding its influence within Israel, among Muslim citizens of Israel, and especially in Jerusalem. In this context, Turkey funds Islamic associations and provides scholarships to Muslim students. But Turkey has concentrated most of its efforts, as mentioned, in Syria. The symbiosis between Ankara and the Syrian rebels, led by the new President al-Sharaa, came to greater expression in recent months. After the overthrow of the Assad regime, the ties between Erdoğan and al-Sharaa became overt: Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan arrived at the Presidential Palace in Damascus, where he met with al-Sharaa. This meeting, by the way, was the first time al-Sharaa shed his military uniform and dressed in a suit and tie. 'I do not doubt that the suit and tie were brought to al-Sharaa by Turkey, if not physically then metaphorically,' said Yanarocak. 'Until then, al-Sharaa walked around in uniform and had a stigma of a terrorist. The Turks turned him into a statesman.' According to Yanarocak, the transformation that al-Sharaa underwent also symbolizes the way Erdoğan perceives him. 'Erdoğan looks at Syria as flesh of Turkey’s flesh, and not as a satellite state,' he explained. 'I am convinced that from Erdoğan’s perspective, al-Sharaa is nothing more than the Ottoman governor of Syria.' The cooperation between Ankara and the new regime in Damascus is worrying, but some of the experts we spoke with suggest not to lose one’s composure. 'On one hand, al-Sharaa owes his success to Turkey,' said Dr. Carmit Valensi, head of the Syria program and senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. 'On the other hand, it’s very clear that he currently wants to disconnect, or at least reduce, Syria’s dependence on foreign factors. 'His foreign minister recently said that they would like to see less foreign presence in Syria, including of Turkey. At the same time, al-Sharaa is also talking with the Saudis, Qataris, and in fact the whole world, including the West. Until the situation in Syria stabilizes, Valensi recommends not rushing to declare al-Sharaa a Turkish puppet, as his predecessor, Bashar Assad, was an Iranian puppet. 'Turkey is not Iran, and Erdoğan is not [Iranian Supreme Leader] Ali Khamenei,' she said. 'True, Erdoğan has Ottoman aspirations, but he is a much more pragmatic player than a fundamentalist who wants to spread the Islamic revolution. I wouldn’t rush to position Turkey as Israel’s new enemy, there is room for dialogue and cooperation with it.' Originally published by Israel Hayom.

Hamas stoking flames in Jerusalem as Ramadan gets underway	Throughout the week, Hamas seized on Israeli police recommendations to limit the number of Muslim worshippers allowed on the Temple Mount during Ramadan, proposing a cap of 10,000 people at a time. By Shachar Kleiman, JNS With Ramadan set to begin at sundown on Friday, Hamas is aiming to spark a wave of terrorist attacks in Jerusalem, including on the Temple Mount. On Thursday, Harun Nasser al-Din, the head of Hamas’s Jerusalem Office, who is currently abroad, declared that there must be 'full confrontation against the occupation’s incursions, an uprising against its projects, and no surrender to attempts at Judaization and expulsion.' Another senior Hamas official urged an escalation of 'resistance in all its forms in Jerusalem,' a clear incitement to terrorist attacks. Al-Din also referenced the demolition of illegally built structures in Jerusalem, accusing Israel of implementing 'malicious plans for expulsion and Judaization projects.' He further emphasized that 'all plans and schemes will be shattered by the escalation of the resistance in all its forms.' Throughout the week, Hamas seized on Israeli police recommendations to limit the number of Muslim worshippers allowed on the Temple Mount during Ramadan, proposing a cap of 10,000 people at a time. In response, the terrorist organization declared that restricting the number of worshippers constitutes 'a dangerous escalation and precedent aimed at undermining freedom of worship at Al-Aqsa mosque.' Hamas further warned Israel about 'the consequences of implementing these recommendations,' stating that it would bear full responsibility for any resulting escalation. At the same time, Hamas is not ruling out an extension of the first phase of the hostage deal and ceasefire in Gaza. If additional phases proceed, they will coincide with the volatile period of Ramadan, which has seen terrorist attacks in the past. Overnight on Wednesday, 642 terrorists were released as part of the deal, including individuals who were freed from prison and sent to eastern Jerusalem. This marks the last hostage release of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, during which 33 captives were returned, including eight who were dead. Hamas spokesman Abd al-Latif al-Qanoua told the Al-Araby channel on Thursday morning that 'the organization is ready to extend the first phase of the hostage deal or merge the two phases according to red lines.' He further claimed that the first phase of the agreement has been completed and the terrorist organization upheld all its commitments despite Israel’s 'ongoing stalling.' Hamas has set several conditions for the second phase, including a 'permanent' end to the war in Gaza and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Strip. This is an edited version of a story originally published by Israel Hayom.

Pentagon declares transgender soldiers disqualified from service ...	Those identified as transgender by the Pentagon will be immediately dismissed from service and given an honorable discharge, provided they maintained a clean record. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Pentagon filed a memo in court on Wednesday stating that transgender soldiers will be disqualified from military service unless granted an exemption. The memo was drafted as part of a lawsuit filed by LGBTQ groups challenging U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order banning transgender people from the military. Although Trump enacted a ban on transgender individuals in the military during his first term, his current order goes further, disqualifying transgender soldiers who enlisted prior to the ban. According to Trump's order, within 30 days, the Pentagon is required to identify service members with 'a current diagnosis of, a history of, or symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria.' Those identified as transgender by the Pentagon will be immediately dismissed from service and given an honorable discharge, provided they maintain a clean record. Individual transgender soldiers may be granted a waiver on a case-by-case basis, 'provided there is a compelling government interest in accessing the applicant that directly supports warfighting capabilities.' They must also demonstrate 36 consecutive months of stability in their sex assigned at birth, without clinical distress or functional impairment, confirm that they have never pursued a medical transition, and agree to adhere to the standards associated with their assigned sex. The Pentagon memo further states that the military will recognize only two sexes and that sex-separate spaces will be used for sleeping, showers, bathrooms, and changing clothes, with these spaces determined by the sex assigned at birth. Soldiers are required to use pronouns and titles relevant to the gender assigned at birth. In January, the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD Law) filed a lawsuit on behalf of six active-duty transgender service members and two transgender individuals seeking to enlist, arguing that Trump's military ban violates their civil rights under the 14th Amendment.

IDF internal report shows false assumptions, outdated strategies ...	A major factor in the Israeli military's failure to prevent the October 7th attack was the assumption that Hamas' primary focus was underground warfare in tunnels, rather than a ground invasion. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An internal IDF investigation revealed that false assumptions and outdated strategies adopted by Israel's military and security officials made the border communities vulnerable to Hamas' invasion on October 7th. Announcing the findings, the Israeli military stated, 'The IDF failed in its mission to protect people,' calling it 'one of the greatest failures' in the military's history. A major factor in this failure was the assumption that Hamas' primary focus was underground warfare in tunnels, rather than a ground invasion. When Yahya Sinwar took control of the terror group in 2017, he shifted its strategy toward ground combat, but Israel's security establishment was unaware of this change. Another incorrect assumption was that Hamas was a 'rational organization' that had been deterred from full-scale conflict following the 2014 Gaza war and Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021. Instead of being deterred, Hamas realized in 2021 that it could successfully launch missiles against Jerusalem and wage a multi-front war, with Hezbollah's help, against Israel. Israel's military also mistakenly believed that, starting in 2017, Hamas was primarily focused on civil development and had no intention of challenging Israel. Even as Hamas leaders planned the invasion and trained their terror army for years, Israel's military assumed their focus was on tunnels. A troubling finding in the investigation revealed that, despite Israel obtaining the 'Wall of Jericho' document—Hamas' attack plan, which was accessed in 2022 and detailed a strategy to flood Israel with thousands of terrorists and invade border and central communities—the military dismissed it as a 'future plan' rather than an imminent threat. Additionally, Israel's military redirected resources from the Gaza border to Judea, Samaria, and northern areas, leaving the Gaza border vulnerable prior to the attack on October 7th, 2023.

Additional hostages may be freed Saturday if ceasefire extended	It is estimated that 59 hostages remain in Gaza with 35 declared dead. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An Israeli source reported on Thursday that additional hostages could be released on Saturday and the ceasefire may be extended. The first stage of the hostage deal ended on Wednesday with the release of four deceased Israeli captives It is estimated that 59 hostages remain in Gaza with 35 declared dead. Also on Thursday, Israel Defense Minister Israel Katz exposed Hamas's plans for a large-scale attack on communities in Judea and Samaria, as well as along the Seam Line security barrier. 'Hamas files were seized that outlined plans to target towns in Judea and Samaria and along the Seam Line,' said Katz in a statement to regional council heads, according to Israel Hayom. 'The communities in Judea and Samaria serve as the protective wall for most of the State of Israel,' the defense minister emphasized. 'When Judea and Samaria are secured, the major cities are secured. We must take an offensive stance in Judea and defeat the enemy.' Hamas responded to the Defense Minister's report insisting that the terror group did not plan to attack IDF soldiers and towns during the ceasefire. Hamas released a statement that said, 'We reaffirm our complete commitment to the ceasefire agreement and all its provisions, as well as our readiness to continue negotiations for the next phase of the agreement.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed the negotiation team to travel to Cairo on Thursday to resume talks on the continuation of the hostage deal with Hamas, following the completion of Phase 1. The decision came after the prime minister held consultations regarding whether Jerusalem should send a delegation for the next round of negotiations. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to visit the region early next week, with a stop in Israel. On Tuesday, Witkoff announced that Israel will send a delegation to Doha or Cairo to move forward with Phase 2 of the hostage deal. Speaking at an American Jewish Committee meeting in Washington, he emphasized the significant progress made and ongoing efforts to secure the release of more hostages. Witkoff also mentioned that he may join the talks if they produce positive outcomes.

Congress backs Iranian movement to overthrow Supreme Leader Khame...	Congress’s push for an Iranian revolution comes as President Trump restarted his 'maximum pressure' sanctions campaign against the regime. By Jewish Breaking News Congress rarely witnesses true bipartisanship these days, yet 151 lawmakers have crossed party lines to introduce a resolution supporting an Iranian resistance movement’s fight to overthrow Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Introduced Wednesday ahead of a congressional hearing titled 'The Future of Iran,' the resolution backs the Iranian people’s stated desire for a 'democratic, secular and non-nuclear 'Islamic Republic through regime change. At the center of Congress’s push stands Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), a leading opposition group known to Iranians as MEK (Mujahedin-e Khalq). For decades, the NCRI has positioned itself as the primary alternative to Iran’s tyrannical government. Rajavi advocates for a 10-point plan to bring democracy and human rights to Iran. She calls for installing the NCRI as a provisional government for six months to establish elections and a constituent assembly. Her plan has already gained support from 4,000 parliamentarians worldwide, according to Fox News. 'The developments of the past year have left no doubt that the source of terrorism and warmongering in the Middle East region is the theocratic Islamic Republic of Iran,' the resolution reads. 'The efforts of Western countries over the past 45 years to change the behavior of this regime have failed, and the ultimate solution to ending the Iranian regime’s threats is the establishment of a secular, democratic, and pluralistic republic by the Iranian people and resistance.' Led by Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), the resolution condemns Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s brutal human rights record, noting that roughly 500 prisoners have been executed after just four months in office. Reports indicate many were labeled as 'political prisoners' without due process, and at least 17 women were among those executed. The United Nations has demanded Pezeshkian cease his cruel execution campaign, which Rajavi says continues a pattern of institutional violence that has claimed approximately 120,000 lives over four decades. Human rights monitors have also documented a disturbing rise in extreme punishments during his tenure, including a significant increase in hand amputations and other severe corporal penalties. Congress’s push for an Iranian revolution comes as President Trump restarted his 'maximum pressure' sanctions campaign against the regime. He has long touted that had he remained in office after the 2020 election, Iran would not have become the terror powerhouse that led to the deadly October 7 massacre against Israel by its proxy Hamas.

State Department completes foreign funding review, identifying 15...	Under former president Joe Biden, USAID funneled scores of grants to foreign nations aimed at advancing 'environmental justice' and 'LGBTQI+ Inclusive Development,' among other left-wing priorities. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon President Donald Trump's State Department completed its review of U.S. foreign aid, identifying nearly 15,000 grants worth $60 billion for elimination, an internal memo reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon shows. The review pertained to foreign aid that flowed from both the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Within the State Department, auditors reviewed more than 9,100 grants worth an estimated $15.9 billion. It identified 4,100 of those grants worth $4.4 billion for elimination. The lion's share of the grants identified for elimination, then, came from the USAID side, where Trump administration officials moved to slash 5,800 grants valued at $54 billion. That marks a 92 percent reduction in USAID's multi-year grant spending, according to the State Department memo. The 'exhaustive review' reflects the monumental changes underway at USAID under Trump. In late January, Secretary of State Marco Rubio unveiled a 90-day freeze on foreign aid aimed at allowing the administration to review programs for their consistency with 'U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.' Under former president Joe Biden, USAID funneled scores of grants to foreign nations aimed at advancing 'environmental justice' and 'LGBTQI+ Inclusive Development,' among other left-wing priorities. Trump went on to name Rubio USAID's acting administrator as he explored formally placing the agency within the State Department. The fate of the agency—as well as the funding cuts—remain in limbo. A number of foreign aid groups and contractors sued the administration earlier this month to resume the paused payments. A Washington, D.C., judge ordered the administration to make nearly $2 billion in taxpayer-funded foreign aid payments by Wednesday's end, though federal attorneys filed a motion on Wednesday urging an appeals court to freeze the order. Roughly two hours before the midnight deadline, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked it, putting it on hold until the court weighs in further. It is no surprise that the majority of the State Department’s cuts center around USAID’s international programming. In addition to its climate and inclusivity spending, the aid group has funneled millions of dollars to anti-Israel advocacy groups and entities linked to terrorism, causing internal friction across multiple administrations, the Free Beacon reported earlier this month. Going forward, the State Department will 'reform the way the United States delivers foreign assistance' following 'decades of institutional drift,' according to its Wednesday memo. 'Every dollar we spend, every program we fund, must be justified with the answer to three simple questions: Does it make America safe? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?' the memo concludes. Upon taking office, the Trump administration quickly set its sights on USAID, forwarding plans to shrink its workforce from around 10,000 staffers to roughly 600. In the early days of the administration's foreign funding freeze, Rubio allowed career staffers to submit waivers for projects they felt were aligned with the 'America First' agenda. Those staffers went on to submit some 200 waivers for programs that would have cost taxpayers $1.2 billion in a single week, including some that pertained to 'environmental justice' and 'LGBTQI+ Inclusive Development,' the Free Beacon reported. The waiver requests exposed a severe disconnect between Trump’s team and career USAID employees. Under Biden, USAID played a central role in the federal government's promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion, including in foreign countries. The agency championed such funding under its 2022-2030 climate strategy, a $150 billion 'whole-of-agency approach' that aimed to create an 'equitable world with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.' In 2023, for instance, Biden’s USAID allocated up to $1 million in taxpayer funds on a project to help disabled people in Tajikistan become 'climate leaders,' the Free Beacon reported at the time. Just before leaving office, the Biden administration pushed out more than $1 million in funding for additional DEI programs abroad. The cash allowed USAID to 'engage with Indigenous-led institutions to implement an Indigenous language technology program' in Guatemala, where nearly 95 percent of residents speak Spanish. Other grants empowered Palestinian activist groups linked to various terror outfits. A November 2022 grant sent $78,000 to the Community Development and Continuing Education Institute, a Palestinian activist group based in Judea and Samaria. Its leaders praised a terrorist who murdered a U.S. military attaché as a 'hero fighter,' the Free Beacon reported. Just six days before Hamas’s Oct. 7 assault on Israel, meanwhile, USAID awarded more than $900,000 'to a terror charity in Gaza involved with the son of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh,' a watchdog report obtained by the Free Beacon found. USAID earmarked the funds for the Bayader Association for Environment and Development, a Gaza-based humanitarian group that was said to be 'in close cooperation with [the] Hamas regime.' USAID would not comment at the time on whether the money was subject to oversight or vetted to ensure it did not benefit Hamas. As taxpayer cash flowed from USAID to foreign groups, federal oversight authorities determined that the agency had persistent issues combating 'corruption, abuse, and fraud.' USAID also came under fire last year for failing to 'prevent the diversion of assistance to Hamas and other terrorist organizations,' according to an inspector general report.

US intel chief Tulsi Gabbard declares ‘radical Islamist terrorism...	She claimed that 'actors tied to Iran’s government' had sought to leverage rising anti-Israel animus by using social media to encourage and finance protests. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard warned in a recent interview that 'radical Islamist terrorism' poses the greatest threat to the safety of the American people, potentially shedding light on her priorities as she starts the job of leading the vast American intelligence community. While speaking with Fox News host Lara Trump, a daughter-in-law of US President Donald Trump, Gabbard dismissed the declaration made in 2021 by then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that white supremacists pose the greatest national security threat to the United States. Instead, Gabbard asserted that Americans face a greater safety threat from 'radical Islamist terrorism.' 'We look at the past four years of open borders, where we had tens of millions of people coming across our borders, many of whom we don’t know who they are or what their intentions are, very specifically the threat of radical Islamist terrorism ​​here within our country is higher than it’s ever been before, not only because of [former US President Joe] Biden’s open borders, but because of his and his administration’s fear of being called Islamophobes,' Gabbard said when asked what the chief threat is to the American people’s safety Following the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, US officials have raised alarm bells about rising Islamist extremism across the globe. Gabbard’s predecessor, former US intelligence chief Avril Haines, warned last March that the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza may have a 'generational impact on terrorism,' asserting that Islamist terrorist groups al Qaeda and Islamic State (ISIS) have been inspired by Hamas to attack Americans and Israelis. Haines also cautioned months later that Iran, which backs Hamas and US intelligence agencies have long called the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism, has ramped up 'influence efforts' on American soil, aiming to 'stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions.' She claimed that 'actors tied to Iran’s government' had sought to leverage rising anti-Israel animus by using social media to encourage and finance protests. Last June, meanwhile, former FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that the 'threat from foreign terrorists rose to a whole ‘nother level after Oct. 7.' Wray revealed that following Hamas’s Oct. 7 rampage, his agency saw the emergence of a 'rogue’s gallery of foreign terrorist organizations call for attacks against Americans and our allies.' He cautioned that 'individuals or small groups will draw twisted inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks here at home.' On New Year’s Day this year, a US Army veteran who pledged allegiance to ISIS drove a truck into a crowd in New Orleans and killed at least 14 people. The suspect, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old Texan who once served in Afghanistan, said the attack was intended to draw attention to 'war between the believers and the disbelievers.' Over the course of her political career, Gabbard has repeatedly called attention to the threat of Islamic extremism. In 2015, the former US congresswoman repudiated the Obama administration for refusing to state that 'Islamic extremists' are embroiled in an armed conflict with the United States. In 2016, Gabbard cautioned about a 'radical political ideology of violent jihad aimed at establishing a totalitarian society governed by laws based on a particular interpretation of Islam.' In 2017, she introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists Act while in Congress to bar the Department of Defense from 'knowingly providing weapons or any other form of support to Al Qaeda, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the Islamic State.'

IDF seizes Hamas plans for mass attack in Judea, Samaria and cent...	Throughout the week, security forces arrested a total of some 75 terror suspects and seized 17 weapons, according to the IDF announcement. By Aliva Van Koningsveld, JNS Defense Minister Israel Katz revealed on Thursday that security forces recently discovered Hamas files proving the terrorist group had plans to carry out a large-scale assault on communities in Judea and Samaria and along the Seam Line security barrier. 'Hamas files have been seized that had a purpose of attacking towns in Judea and Samaria and along the Seam Line,' Katz said in remarks to heads of regional councils, Israel Hayom reported. 'The communities in Judea and Samaria are the protective wall of most of the State of Israel,' the defense minister declared. 'When Judea and Samaria are protected, the large cities are protected. We must be on the offensive in Judea and defeat the enemy.' The Yesha Council umbrella group that represents the approximately 500,000 Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria said in a response: 'The Oct. 7, [2023], terror attack must not be repeated—nor in the Seam Line towns, nor in the cities of the Sharon [coastal plain], nor in Judea and Samaria. 'The way to prevent this is a clear defeat of terrorism—not only through targeted operations, but in a comprehensive move that will neutralize the threat to the cities of the Center and Judea and Samaria,' it added. Tulkarem, a Palestinian terrorist hub in Samaria, east of Netanya, where Israeli forces have been conducting intensive counter-terrorism operations since last month, is located eight miles from the densely populated coastal plain. Jerusalem stepped up raids after explosives were discovered on five buses in the cities of Bat Yam and Holon, south of Tel Aviv, on Feb. 20, which authorities called 'an attempt to perpetrate a series of terrorist attacks with mass casualties.' One of the bombs bore an Arabic message referencing Tulkarem. No one was injured. As part of the 'Iron Wall' counter-terror operation in northern Samaria, Israeli forces arrested four wanted Palestinian suspects, the IDF said on Thursday, adding that four M-16 rifles were found in their possession. Throughout the week, security forces arrested a total of some 75 terror suspects and seized 17 weapons, according to the IDF announcement. More than two in three Israeli Jews fear that Judea and Samaria terrorist organizations could carry out a significant attack similar to the Hamas-led massacre of some 1,200 people in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, according to a recent poll published by the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs. Earlier this week, it was revealed that security forces last month seized a 220-pound explosive device that a Palestinian terrorist cell had planned to use against soldiers deployed to Judea and Samaria. In September, Israeli authorities filed an indictment against a member of a terrorist squad based in Jenin who planned to infiltrate civilian communities in Samaria and carry out an Oct. 7-style massacre. The indictment accused Osama Bani Fadl and other terrorist operatives of making serious preparations for a mass slaughter targeting Jewish residents of Samaria, including by infiltrating towns with vehicles. Palestinian terrorists targeted Israeli Jews in Judea and Samaria at least 6,343 times in 2024, according to figures published by the Rescuers Without Borders (Hatzalah Judea and Samaria) NGO on Feb. 17. Twenty-seven Israelis were murdered in Judea and Samaria in 2024, and more than 300 others were wounded, the group said in its annual report. The figures, which were cross-checked against official data from Israel’s security services, included 3,668 instances of rock-throwing; 843 attacks with Molotov cocktails; 671 attempts to blind drivers with laser pointers; 526 explosive charges; 364 cases of arson; and 179 terrorist shootings. The rescue group also recorded 37 attempted or successful stabbings; 36 bottles of paint being thrown at vehicles; and 19 Palestinian car-ramming attacks, including 12 that caused injuries to Israelis. The report noted that the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) last year foiled more than 1,000 potential attacks in Judea, Samaria and Jerusalem.

Netanyahu sends team to Cairo for Hamas ceasefire talks	Hamas faces three possible paths: surrender, disarmament, and exile to bring the war to an end; extending Phase 1 of the truce through further exchanges of hostages for terrorist prisoners and increased humanitarian aid; or a return to full-scale combat. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed the negotiation team to head to Cairo on Thursday to resume discussions on the continuation of the hostage deal with Hamas following the completion of Phase 1. The decision came after the premier held consultations centering on whether Jerusalem would send a delegation for the next stage of negotiations. Following the announcement, anonymous Israeli officials told reporters that Jerusalem expects Hamas to release additional captives as early as Saturday, in exchange for an extension of the truce. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is set to visit the region early next week, including a stop in Israel. Witkoff announced on Tuesday that Israel will send a delegation to Doha or Cairo to advance Phase 2 of the hostage deal. Speaking at an American Jewish Committee meeting in Washington, he highlighted significant progress and efforts to secure the release of more hostages. Witkoff added that he may join the talks if they yield positive results. In an interview with Fox News’ 'Fox & Friends' on Thursday, Witkoff said that the administration’s ability to get Phase 1 of the deal over the finish line was 'an accomplishment in and of itself.' On the ongoing negotiations with Hamas on Phase 2, Witkoff noted that the president was 'intolerant toward terrorists; that’s a fact. He’s got a red line with regard to people who do heinous things like this. 'There’s no room for Hamas in Gaza or in the West Bank,' the U.S. envoy said of Jerusalem’s condition that the Strip be fully demilitarized. 'You can see from their actions that they haven’t earned that right to be there, so that’s the president’s position and we follow that direction.' Discussions on the return of the remaining hostages are set to begin in Cairo in the coming days, and Israel intends to send a delegation to these talks, building on the groundwork established over the past two weeks in the U.S. between Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Witkoff, Israel Hayom reported on Wednesday. Defense Minister Israel Katz declared on Thursday that the first phase of the ceasefire is complete, emphasizing Israel’s commitment to securing the return of more hostages from Gaza. Speaking at a conference of regional council heads, he highlighted that Israel has recovered 25 hostages alive, including female soldiers, and eight deceased individuals. Katz stressed that Israel agreed to the ceasefire solely to facilitate hostage recovery, not due to ammunition shortages or the fatigue of soldiers. He warned that Hamas must understand the IDF is prepared to resume combat and reiterated that Hamas will not retain control over Gaza. Additionally, Katz expressed support for facilitating voluntary Palestinian emigration, stating that Israel is advancing plans to enable departures via Ashdod Port or Ramon Airport near Eilat if Trump’s initiative moves forward. Israeli sources told Israel Hayom that Hamas faces three possible paths: surrender, disarmament, and exile to bring the war to an end; extending Phase 1 of the truce through further exchanges of hostages for terrorist prisoners and increased humanitarian aid; or a return to full-scale combat. The IDF will not pull out of the Philadelphi Corridor that separates the Gaza Strip from Egypt, an Israeli official told reporters on Thursday, saying Jerusalem would refuse to allow Hamas terrorists regroup and again attack Israeli communities. 'We will not leave the Philadelphi Corridor. We will not allow the Hamas murderers to again roam our borders with pickup trucks and guns, and we will not allow them to rearm through smuggling,' the source said in a statement made to Israeli reporters on condition of anonymity. This commitment comes despite the ceasefire’s requirement for the Israel Defense Forces to vacate the stretch, some 110-yards wide and 8.7-miles long, along Gaza’s border with Sinai, eight days after the first phase of the truce.

Arab-Israeli terrorist wounds 8 in northern Israel	Combination ramming and stabbing south of Haifa leavess 8 people wounded, including 2 in serious condition. By World Israel News Staff A terrorist attack in northern Israel left at least eight people wounded Thursday afternoon, including two people who were seriously injured. The attack occurred at approximately 4:20 PM when a terrorist driving by Karkur Junction on Highway 65 near the city of Pardes Hana-Karkur rammed into multiple pedestrians. The terrorist then exited the vehicle and proceeded to stab several people. At least two police officers were stabbed during the attack, according to preliminary reports. Officers responding to the attack opened fire and fatally wounded the terrorist on the scene. Israeli media outlets reported that the terrorist has been identified as a 24-year-old Arab citizen of Israel from the town of Ma'ale Iron. The terrorist had no prior criminal or terror-related record. 'The terrorist ran over several people at a bus station, then proceeded to stab others and crashed into a police vehicle,' Israel Police said in a statement Thursday. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the injured, while police forces were deployed to the area. 'According to passersby, this was a vehicle that hit several people standing on the sidewalk,' United Hatzalah paramedics Lahav Sliman, Eli Teichholz and Nadav Gov reported from the scene. 'We provided assistance at the scene to approximately ten victims (aged 20-40) who were seriously, moderately, and moderately injured. The United Hatzalah Psychotrauma Unit also provided assistance to the panicked witnesses who were at the scene.' According to MDA spokesman Zaki Heller, five men and three women were wounded in Thursday's attack,, ranging in age from 20 to 70. Two of the victims are in serious condition, while three are listed in moderate condition, and three in light condition. 'We arrived at a complex scene with a lot of commotion following a vehicle that struck several pedestrians,' MDA paramedic Avi Cohen relayed from the scene. 'There were eight injured people at the scene—two in serious condition, three in moderate condition, and three with minor injuries. They were near a bus station at the Pardes Hanna-Karkur junction, in the westbound lane, when the vehicle hit them.' 'When we arrived, they were lying in the rear area. We immediately began providing medical treatment to all the injured, including stopping bleeding and bandaging wounds. We loaded them into ambulances and mobile intensive care units and quickly evacuated them to Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in Hadera.'

Israel identifies bodies of 4 returned captives murdered by Hamas...	Forensics examiners verified that the four bodies returned by Hamas belong to Ohad Yahalomi, Tsahi Idan, Shlomo Mantzur and Itzik Elgarat. By World Israel News Staff Israeli forensics teams confirmed the identities of four slain hostages returned to Israel from the Gaza Strip overnight, bringing the total number of captives released during the six-week ceasefire to 33. On Thursday morning, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office announced that forensics examiners verified that the four bodies returned by Hamas via the Red Cross overnight belong to Ohad Yahalomi, Tsahi Idan, Shlomo Mantzur and Itzik Elgarat. 'Following the completion of the identification process by the IDF, the Health Ministry National Center of Forensic Medicine and the Israel Police, IDF representatives have, overnight, informed the Yahalomi, Idan, Mantzur and Elgarat families that their loved ones – Ohad Yahalomi, Tsahi Idan, Shlomo Mantzur and Itzik Elgarat, of blessed memory – were murdered and have been returned for burial in Israel,' the PMO said. Unlike previous exchanges, including one that included a ghoulish ceremony featuring the public display of murdered captives' coffins in front of cheering crowds of Gazans, Hamas quietly transferred the remains of what it says are four Israelis kidnapped on October 7th to the Red Cross in Gaza. Previously, Israel had waited until all captives were back on Israeli soil before releasing prisoners but began freeing terrorists within minutes of the bodies being received by the Red Cross. However, Israel is releasing the terrorists in waves of some 100 every few hours and will presumably halt the process if the bodies are not positively identified. The release of the four slain captives' bodies triggered Israel to advance the release of some 600 terrorists, who were originally slated to be released last Saturday. Israel indefinitely postponed their release after Hamas held a public ceremony, that included forcing one of the kidnapped Israelis to kiss a terrorist on the forehead. The body of a Gazan woman, whom Hamas claimed it accidentally sent to Israel in place of Shiri Bibas last Thursday, was returned to the Strip. According to Hebrew-language media reports, 37 Palestinian prisoners were released to Ramallah in the early hours of Thursday morning. Videos circulating on social media showed raucous celebrations in the streets of the Palestinian Authority-administered city, as the freed prisoners were greeted with a hero's welcome. Five Palestinians convicted on terror charges were freed to eastern Jerusalem, including Hamza al-Kaluti. A Hamas member sentenced to life for planning deadly suicide bombings, he served 24 years in prison before being freed to his home in eastern Jerusalem's Beit Hanina neighborhood. Some 97 prisoners were deported to Egypt.

Tsahi Idan, whose family was held at gunpoint during livestream, ...	The livestream video of terrorists holding 49-year-old Tsahi Idan and his family at gunpoint after murdering his teenage daughter became a symbol of October 7th. With his body finally returned to Israel, he will be laid to rest with his daughter. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News On Thursday, Israeli forensics examiners confirmed that the remains of Tsahi Idan, a resident of Kibbutz Nahal Oz, were returned to Israel from the Gaza Strip. Idan, the last of four slain hostages to be identified following their return to Israel overnight, was 49 at the time of his abduction on October 7th, 2023, and is survived by his wife, and two of the couple's three children. The Idan family announced Thursday he will be buried alongside his 18-year-old daughter Maayan, who was shot and killed during the October 7th invasion. Tsahi's wife, Gali, and two of the couple's children survived the attack, which was livestreamed by terrorists using Gali's phone. 'The unbearable journey of our family to bring back our beloved and precious Tsahi from the hell of Gaza has come to an end,' the Idan family said Thursday. 'Tsahi was abducted while on his feet, and we received several signs of life from him,' the family continued. 'As of the November 2023 deal, he was still alive and was expected to be released.' 'Tsahi will be laid to rest alongside his beloved daughter, Maayan, who was murdered on October 7 while trying to help her father protect the shelter door.' Footage from the livestream in their house quickly went viral after October 7th, showing gun-toting Gaza terrorists holding Tsahi, Gali, and their two surviving children hostage at gunpoint in their home, after Maayan was shot and killed. The family's two younger children can be seen mourning the loss of their sister in the video. document.createElement('video'); The post Tsahi Idan, whose family was held at gunpoint during livestream, to be buried next to daughter appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/tsahi-idan-whose-family-was-held-at-gunpoint-during-livestream-to-be-buried-with-his-daughter/	2025-02-27T04:56:00-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/idan.webp
Miriam, Jared, Josh: 5 Jewish takeaways from Michael Wolff’s insi...	Trump’s Jewish daughter and son-in-law, declined to support Trump or sign a statement that he was not antisemitic after Oct. 7, when Trump initially lambasted Israeli leadership for allowing the attack on Israel to take place. By Philissa Cramer, JTA Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the most prominent Jews in Donald Trump’s family, categorically refused to demonstrate support for him as he floundered after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, according to a new book by magazine writer Michael Wolff. Wolff is known for his rollicking, literary style and speedy execution of political stories. His latest, 'All or Nothing,' came out this week, just months after the events it chronicles during Trump’s victorious 2024 presidential campaign. The book focuses on the campaign’s roller-coaster ride from post-Jan. 6 dejection to victory, with a heavy emphasis on Trump’s legal travails during that time. There are plenty of Jewish vignettes along the way, with Trump’s Jewish advisor Boris Epshteyn bookending the story. Here are five Jewish tidbits to know from Wolff’s reporting. Trump’s team tried to convince him not to compare himself to a victim of the Nazis. After he was indicted on federal conspiracy charges, Trump said he was being persecuted as the Nazis had persecuted their victims — a comparison that earned him scorn from American Jewish groups. Wolff reports that Trump was fixated on the idea, writing, 'The entire political team, along with panicky lawyers, tried to talk him out of the Nazi references, but Trump was adamant.' Trump did not enjoy his meetings with Miriam Adelson, the casino magnate who has picked up where her late husband Sheldon left off in bankrolling Republican candidates. 'She is so boring. She just goes on and on,' Wolff quotes him as saying, later adding that he believed Adelson was lying to him about her plan to support him. Trump ultimately got more than $100 million from Adelson — and she ended up with proximity to the president at his inauguration. Kushner and Ivanka Trump distanced themselves from Trump and his campaign after Trump’s 2020 election loss, moving to Miami and focusing, for Kushner, on business deals. ('It was a Trumpworld joke that Jared was a wholly owned entity of the House of Saud,' Wolff writes.) Trump’s Jewish daughter and son-in-law, declined to support Trump or sign a statement that he was not antisemitic after Oct. 7, when Trump initially lambasted Israeli leadership for allowing the attack on Israel to take place. (Trump was annoyed that the attack on Israel distracted from his campaign, Wolff writes.) 'No, Ivanka and I aren’t going to do that. We’re not going to go and put our name on something and get in the middle of things,' Kushner said, according to Wolff. 'That’s just not what we’re going to do this time.' Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said during the campaign season, as Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris considered him as a running mate, that Trump was 'obsessed' with him. Wolff suggests that that was true. 'If putting Shapiro on the ballot gave Harris Pennsylvania, Trump was convinced, he’d lose the election,' he writes, later adding that Trump and his team also came to believe what many others did — that Shapiro might prefer to run solo for the presidency in 2028 than leave his position and risk losing in the number-two slot. Ultimately, Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — and Shapiro remains popular in Pennsylvania, which Trump won by nearly two percentage points along with every other swing state. After Rep. Mike Johnson made a triumphant visit to Columbia University to denounce the pro-Palestinian student encampment there last spring, the speaker of the House urged Trump to do the same but was rebuffed. 'No students, no students!' Trump reportedly said, in line with his political strategy, Wolff writes, of only appearing in front of admiring audiences. Since being sworn in, Trump has signed an executive order vowing to crack down on colleges that allow antisemitism to flourish and deport foreign students who support terror groups.

Iran’s near-bomb-grade uranium stockpile jumps, IAEA reports say	The stock of uranium refined to up to 60 percent in the form of uranium hexafluoride grew by 92.5 kg in the past quarter to 274.8 kg, one of two confidential IAEA reports said. By Reuters and Algemeiner Iran‘s stock of uranium close to weapons grade has jumped since it announced a dramatic acceleration in enrichment in December and there has been no progress on resolving outstanding issues, two reports by the UN nuclear watchdog said on Wednesday. The stock of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent fissile purity, close to the roughly 90 percent of bomb grade, has been a long-standing concern for Western powers, which say there is no civil justification for enriching uranium to such a high level. Iran says it seeks only peaceful nuclear energy. While US President Donald Trump’s administration has said it plans to pressure Iran over its nuclear program, the International Atomic Energy Agency has said time is running out for diplomacy to impose new restrictions on Iran‘s activities. 'The significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon state to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,' the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a passage that, unusually, was included in both its quarterly reports on Iran. Those confidential reports, sent to member states on Wednesday and both seen by Reuters, showed that while the stock of 60 percent material grew by half, there was no real progress on resolving long-running outstanding issues including the unexplained presence of uranium traces at undeclared sites. The stock of uranium refined to up to 60 percent in the form of uranium hexafluoride grew by 92.5 kg in the past quarter to 274.8 kg, one of two confidential IAEA reports said. That is enough in principle, if enriched further, for six nuclear bombs, according to an IAEA yardstick. There is enough for more weapons at lower enrichment levels. Where before its latest acceleration Iran was producing between 6 and 9 kilograms (13 and 20 pounds) of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent per month, now that figure is between 35 and 40 kg, a senior diplomat said. This is just short of the 42 kg that is enough in principle for one bomb, if refined further. One of the reports spelled out the lack of progress on the outstanding issues such as explaining the uranium traces, which the IAEA has been asking the Islamic Republic to do for years. 'Iran states that it has declared all of the nuclear material, activities and locations required under its Safeguards Agreement. This is inconsistent with the Agency’s assessments,' it said. 'The Agency is, therefore, at an impasse with regard to resolving these outstanding safeguards issues.' During his first, 2017-21 term as president, Trump withdrew the United States from a landmark deal between Iran and major powers that placed temporary limits on Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. After Trump pulled out in 2018, Iran breached and far surpassed those limits. With the deal now largely in tatters, European powers are seeking to either have the US help agree new limits on Iran‘s nuclear program or use a mechanism in the deal to re-impose all sanctions before the deal expires in October.

With the return and positive identification of Ohad Yahalomi, Tsahi Idan, Shlomo Mantzur, and Itzik Elgarat, Israel has now received all 33 of the hostages slated for the first phase of the ceasefire - 25 of them alive, 8 dead. By World Israel News Staff Israeli forensics teams on Thursday confirmed the identities of four slain hostages returned to Israel from the Gaza Strip overnight, bringing the total number of captives released during the six-week ceasefire to 33. On Thursday morning, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office announced that forensics examiners verified that the four bodies returned by Hamas via the Red Cross overnight belong to Ohad Yahalomi, Tsahi Idan, Shlomo Mantzur, and Itzik Elgarat. 'Following the completion of the identification process by the IDF, the Health Ministry National Center of Forensic Medicine, and the Israel Police, IDF representatives have, overnight, informed the Yahalomi, Idan, Mantzur, and Elgarat families that their loved ones – Ohad Yahalomi, Tsahi Idan, Shlomo Mantzur, and Itzik Elgarat, of blessed memory – were murdered and have been returned for burial in Israel,' the PMO said. 'Pursuant to the intelligence and all of the information at our disposal, Ohad Yahalomi, Tsahi Idan, and Itzik Elgarat were murdered while held hostage in Gaza. Shlomo Mantzur was murdered in the 7 October 2023 massacre and his body had been held in the Gaza Strip.' The overnight transfer marks the last hostage return scheduled for the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire, tentatively slated to end this coming Sunday. Of the 33 hostages returned to Israel over the past six weeks, 25 are alive, with 8 more returned dead - including some murdered on October 7th and others killed in captivity in the Gaza Strip. The victims returned overnight include 49-year-old Kibbutz Nahal Oz resident Tsachi Idan, whose daughter, Maayan, was murdered during the invasion of October 7th; 50-year-old Ohad Yahalomi of Kibbutz Nir Oz; fellow Kibbutz Nir Oz resident Itzik Elgarat, who was 68 at the time of his abduction; and Shlomo Mantzur, 85. 'Our hearts ache upon receiving the bitter news of the identification of Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan, Itzik Elgarat, and Shlomo Mantzur, whose bodies were returned overnight from captivity at the hands of Hamas terrorists,' said President Isaac Herzog Thursday morning, eulogizing the slain hostages. 'Ohad Yahalomi was a man of the land and a devoted family man, a lover of Israel who dedicated himself to preserving its landscapes through his work with the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.' 'Itzik Elgarat was a devoted father of two and a beloved uncle to his nieces and nephews. He embraced life to the fullest and was especially cherished by the members of Kibbutz Nir Oz, with whom he loved playing backgammon.' Tsachi Idan, who was kidnapped to Gaza on October 7, was a loving husband to his courageous wife, Gali, and a devoted father to Sharon, Yael, Shachar, and Maayan —a wonderful young girl who was brutally murdered in their home before her family’s eyes by terrorists who barbarically broadcasted the horrific moments of her murder.' 'Shlomo Mantzur came from a proud Zionist family that immigrated from Iraq. He survived the Farhud Pogrom against the Jews of Baghdad, and came to Israel in his youth.'

Nobel laureate on terrorist release deal: ‘We’re killing ourselve...	The deal called for the release of 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for about 1,900 imprisoned terrorists, many of them murderers serving multiple life sentences. By David Isaac, JNS Yisrael (Robert J.) Aumann was awarded the 2005 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contribution to Game Theory, a branch of applied mathematics that studies strategic interactions between individuals or groups. Aumann has said that if he could describe Game Theory in one word, it would be 'incentives.' JNS caught up with Aumann on Feb. 23 at his offices in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he is a member of the Einstein Institute of Mathematics and The Federmann Center for the Study of Rationality, to ask what he thought of the current prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hamas. The deal called for the release of 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for about 1,900 imprisoned terrorists, many of them murderers serving multiple life sentences. In a word, said Aumann, 'Crazy.' 'The basis of Game Theory is to give incentives to the other side to do what’s good for you,' Aumann told JNS. 'And we keep doing the opposite. We are literally killing ourselves. We are killing our own children. It’s not only that they will kidnap more. We are incentivizing them to attack us again and again, to make war against us, to repeat Oct. 7,' he said, referring to the Hamas-led massacre of Oct. 7, 2023. Q: Do we know the recidivism rates of these released prisoners who return to terror? A: We don’t have the exact number. It’s important. Someone should pull together those numbers. It doesn’t even require any analysis. It’s just a matter of gathering the available data. There are a lot of sources. When it comes to recidivism, not every terrorist attack is successful. In fact, my subjective impression is that most terrorist attacks are not successful. Most of the time, they kill the terrorist, or they stop him before he manages to kill someone. Let’s say the number of unsuccessful attacks is somewhere between 50% to 75%. But that leaves successful ones between 25% and 50%, and if you talk about 1,000 terrorists released, we get maybe between 250 and 500 successful terrorist attacks where they manage to kill somebody, at least one person. That’s at least 250 dead for 33 live hostages. Just on that basis alone, it’s obviously a terrible deal. But that’s not the worst of it. The worst of it is that again and again we’re going to have people kidnapped. We’ve shown the enemy that it’s worth it, that we will completely give up and raise a white flag even if you abduct one, like with Gilad Shalit [an IDF soldier kidnapped by Hamas in June 2006 and exchanged five years later for 1,027 terrorist prisoners.] We’ve given them incentives to go and kidnap more and more. And they’ve said they’re going to do it. They did it in the past. So we better believe them. Q: Is Game Theory relevant to understanding this deal? A: There’s a game that’s more or less relevant to the conflict, and that is the Blackmailer’s Game. I don’t even think that the Blackmailer’s Game is that relevant, but I’ll tell you what it is. Anne and Bob are given $10,000 and told, 'You get the $10,000 if you can agree how to split it.' Anne is overjoyed. She says she doesn’t have that much money and $5,000 means a lot. She says, 'Bob, we have $10,000— $5,000 to me, $5,000 to you.' Bob says, 'No way, I’m not leaving this room with less than $9,000.' Anne says, 'Be reasonable.' He says, 'I won’t go away with less than $9,000 and if you want, you don’t have to agree. We’ll both go away with nothing.' So Anne thinks it over for a while, and says, 'Okay, $1,000 is better than nothing.' And that’s how they split it. Now the trouble with that is that Anne is rational and Bob is the one who’s irrational, but the irrational guy comes out with a lot more than the rational one. Q: If you were Israel’s chief negotiator, what would you tell the other side? A: I would say one for one. One prisoner per hostage is the maximum. And if they say it’s out of the question, I would say, 'Okay, now we wipe you out.' I would stop this hostage business. One for one, that’s my answer. And if it means that no hostages are released, so be it. Let the people in Kaplan do what they want. [The Israeli protesters calling for a hostage release deal gather near Kaplan Street in Tel Aviv.] Q: How can Israel break this pattern of handing over enormous numbers of prisoners for a handful of captives? A: You just change it. At the beginning, I guess they will just kill the kidnapped. Or they’ll keep them, hoping we relent. A specific part of the deal of this last exchange, stage one [of the ceasefire agreement], was that the released prisoners do not even have to sign a non-binding statement that they will not return to terrorism. That’s an explicit part of the agreement—that they don’t have to agree. So we are actually killing ourselves. And the tremendous amount of fuss that’s made over bodies is absolutely terrible. We should give zero for bodies. Even people on the right make a big fuss about the bodies that are released. A body is a body. It’s not a person. We should take a very tough stance, one that will probably simply be rejected by the other side. We should do this for the future. My children are no longer of army age. But I have grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and I want them to live. I’m almost 95, but I’m worried about them. People wave these banners at the protests that say, 'What would you say if it were your father?' If it was my father, maybe I’d say something different. I’m not sure. But our government has to worry not only about the people whose father is captive, but about the whole population. If we’re going to get 10 people killed for one captive released, then that’s bad. Q: What do you think of the death penalty as a solution? If we kill all the terrorists, then there are none to exchange. A: It’s something to consider. That’s a big step to take, and I’m not sure. The original law that there’s no death penalty in Israel except for Nazi [criminals]—in fact, it was only carried out for [Adolf] Eichmann—I think that that is good because it sets the Holocaust apart from everything else. I’m also afraid of ourselves, of our judicial system, that this would lead to complications. There’s something I want to say that I haven’t said before. The other side are idealists. Yes, they are terrorists and they want to kill me, but their motives are not low or degraded. They stick by their ideals, and they’re willing to give their lives for their ideals. I want to kill them, but I respect them. Q: You have criticized the campaign of the hostages’ families as raising the price that Hamas demands for the hostages. A: Let’s be honest. It’s not the hostages’ families. The handful of hostages’ families could never have raised the billions that this campaign cost. These are people who are opposed to the government … this is an attempt to bring down the government, or to [force them to] throw up their hands in the war, to give up. There are people here opposed to the Zionist enterprise. They want a country for all its citizens, one-state or something like that. I would add that not all the Kaplan people are post-Zionists. But the leadership is, the people who drive it. And the others sort of go along. There are some very good Zionists there. Some of my own descendants are part of the Kaplan protests. Q: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the Gilad Shalit deal and now he’s making another Shalit deal. How do you explain that? Why isn’t he putting a stop to it? A: [U.S. President Donald] Trump threatened. He said before he was sworn in that there’s going to be hell to pay if there’s no deal. This was generally interpreted as a threat to Hamas, but actually it may also have been a threat to Netanyahu. Also, one of the main people on the negotiating team was the head of the Shabak [the Israel Security Agency], who is left wing. Now this is changing, but maybe part of the problem was that the negotiating team was no good. But it’s a small part of the problem. Q: If we know where these deals lead, why do we keep doing them? A: It’s a post-Zionist tendency. They actually control what’s being done. They can throw out cases; laws that are passed by the Knesset. They’re in charge of the army. They’re in charge of the police. I won’t say that they’re totally running the country. But they have tentacles and that has a lot of practical effects. Earlier I said I respect our enemy. But I don’t respect—I won’t call them the enemy—but the other side, the post-Zionists. If they don’t like it here, they should leave.

BBC whitewashed Gaza antisemitism in documentary with intentional...	The loaded term 'Jihad' became 'battle,' while 'Jews' turned into 'Israeli forces.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The accusations against the BBC of acting as a shill for Hamas grew stronger Monday when The Telegraph reported that the British broadcaster had mistranslated the Gazans’ speech in its documentary about the Israel-Hamas war to tone down their support of violence and hatred of Jews. The daily found that this occurred in at least five places in 'Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.' The movie, which interviewed and followed Gazan civilians talking about the war, removed all their references to jihad, which is a term Arabs commonly use to describe a holy war to destroy the Jewish state, and turned 'Jews' into 'Israelis' or 'Israeli forces.' According to a translation provided to The Telegraph by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (CAMERA), a woman who was describing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s last moments as 'His face was covered and his weapon was ready, prepared for battle,' was in fact really saying, 'His face was covered, he was wearing a vest and ready for Jihad.' One of the children being interviewed also lauded Sinwar for his personal 'resistance and jihad against the Jews,' but the BBC turned it into 'fighting Israeli forces.' Another child said, 'The Jews came, they destroyed us, Hamas and the Jews,' but it was translated as 'the Israelis destroyed everything, and so did Hamas.' The Telegraph separately reported that it had found social media comments by the documentary’s cameraman, Hatem Rawagh, that seemed to praise the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led invasion of Israel and massacre of 1,200 people. In one post to X, he showed a Hamas clip of an attack on the Erez border crossing and wrote, 'return to view this clip a million times.' He also previously celebrated terror attacks against Israel, posting scenes of joy in Gaza when an Italian tourist was killed and seven people wounded in a car-ramming attack in Tel Aviv in 2023. These reports follow the revelation earlier this month by investigative journalist David Collier that the movie was narrated by the son of Hamas’ Deputy Minister of Agriculture in Gaza, Ayman Alyazouri. Considering that 'two photographers followed' this boy and two others 'for months,' Collier noted, 'they absolutely knew who he was&#8230;. How did the BBC let a son of a Hamas minister walk around looking for sympathy and demonizing Israel for an hour in a BBC documentary?' This prompted Labour Against Antisemitism head Alex Hearn to file a formal complaint with the BBC, saying, 'This documentary appears to have been a failure of due diligence by the BBC, with Hamas propaganda promoted as reliable fact at the taxpayers’ expense.' The BBC is funded in large part by a universal television tax on British citizens. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch wrote a scathing letter to BBC head Tim Davie, asking in part, ''Would the BBC be this naive if it was commissioning content from North Korea or the Islamic Republic of Iran?' She demanded to know whether any Hamas officials received any payment from the BBC, considering the family links of the narrator. Badenoch additionally told Davie that he 'should commission a full independent inquiry' to consider this case as well as 'repeated and serious allegations of systemic and institutional bias against Israel in the BBC's coverage of the war.' Israel supporters and the country’s officials have also accused the BBC of longstanding bias, pointing out, for example, that it never uses the word 'terrorists' to describe Hamas or other Palestinians who carry out terror attacks. The BBC would not even allow an Israeli documentary of Hamas’ massacre at the Nova dance festival to be aired unless any reference to the perpetrators as terrorists was edited out. Following the fierce criticism, the BBC pulled the documentary from its digital platforms and announced an internal investigation of its production.

Key House committee replaces ‘West Bank’ with Judea & Samaria’	Republican effort to have the historical terminology 'Judea and Samaria' replace the 20th century term 'West Bank' gains momentum, with critical House committee instructing staffers to make the change. By World Israel News Staff A key committee in the House of Representatives has taken a step towards changing the terminology used to describe the territories occupied by Jordan from 1948 to 1967 before being captured by Israeli forces during the Six Day War. According to a report by Axios Wednesday night, the chairman of the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee has instructed all Republican staffers working with the committee to use the term 'Judea and Samaria' in place of the term 'West Bank.' Florida Republican Brian Mast, chairman of the committee, issued the instructions Tuesday according to a memo obtained by Axios. 'In recognition of our unbreakable bond with Israel and the inherent right of the Jewish people to their ancient homeland,' Mast wrote, 'the House Foreign Affairs committee will, from here forward, refer to the West Bank as Judea and Samaria in formal correspondence, communication and documentation.' 'As representatives of the American people, we must do our part to stem this reprehensible tide of antisemitism and recognize Israel's rightful claim to the cradle of Jewish civilization.' While the move only impacts the roughly 50 Republican staffers on the committee, and does not compel staffers for Democratic lawmakers on the committee, it marks the first step in a larger effort by the GOP in Congress to shift from the use of the Jordanian term 'West Bank,' to the biblical names of the two areas, Judea and Samaria, included in the territory. After capturing Judea and Samaria during the 1948-1949 Israeli War of Independence, Jordan annexed the territory in 1950, renaming the combined territories as Cisjordan or alternatively, the West Bank, in contrast to the rest of the Hashemite kingdom, located on the East Bank of the River Jordan. House and Senate Republicans have in recent years pushed legislative measures to formally replace the term 'West Bank' with 'Judea and Samaria' in all federal documents. With Trump's election last November, New York Rep. Claudia Tenney and Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton resumed their efforts to pass legislation altering the terminology used by the federal government.

Hamas preparing for new round of fighting with Israel – report	With end of first phase of ceasefire just days away and no agreement one phase two in sight, Gaza terror group reportedly rushing to repair tunnels and terror infrastructure and redeploy armed forces for new round of fighting with Israel. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization is actively preparing for a new round of fighting with Israel The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, as talks for the implementation of the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal continue in Doha, Qatar. The first phase of the ceasefire is slated to end this coming Sunday, and with no comprehensive deal in the offing in the brokered talks in Doha, Hamas is said to be quietly gearing up for resumed fighting in the Gaza Strip. Anonymous sources informed the Journal that the Islamist terror group is in the midst of planning the redeployment of it forces across Gaza, in preparation for possible Israeli incursions. Hamas is also said to be rebuilding terror tunnels and restoring other infrastructure critical for hostilities with IDF ground forces. The report claimed that Izz al-Din al-Haddad, the commander of Hamas' military forces in the northern Gaza Strip, met this month with other senior Hamas officials to draft plans for a new round of hostilities with Israel. The terror group is also working frantically to train new combatants to replace terrorists killed in the war with Israel. In addition, Hamas is said to be expanding its efforts to identify Gazans who have collaborated with Israel. On Wednesday, Hamas issued a statement rejecting President Donald Trump's Gaza resettlement plan, and demanding an end to the 'ongoing Israeli occupation.' 'Unfortunately, Trump is reintroducing ideas that do not take into account the culture and interests of the Palestinian people,' Hamas politburo member and former Gaza health minister Bassem Naim said. 'Our goal is not to improve prison conditions, but to end the occupation and be free of it.' Hamas has thus far rejected Israel's demands at the Doha talks for the disarmament and removal of Hamas forces from Gaza as a condition for implementation of the second phase of the ceasefire deal. Egyptian and Qatari brokers have suggested the two sides extend the current arrangement temporarily, should no comprehensive deal be reached by the March 2nd deadline.

Israeli sentenced to 7 years in Malaysian prison	Police were suspicious that Avitan was a Mossad spy, but eventually accepted his explanation that he was there to settle a dispute with another criminal. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli known to be involved in organized crime was sentenced by a Malaysian court to seven years in prison, accepting a plea bargain after he was charged with weapons offenses. Shalom Avitan entered Malaysia, which has no diplomatic relations with Israel, using a French passport, according to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Mako. Avitan was said to have traveled to the Muslim country in April 2024 with the goal of assassinating another Israeli organized crime figure, Eran Haya, with whom he had an ongoing criminal disputer in Israel. He was arrested after purchasing weapons and ammunition from a local Malaysian couple, who are also facing criminal charges. Several days after his arrival in Malaysia, police raided Avitan's hotel room in Kuala Lumpur, seizing six guns and 158 bullets. Initially, police were suspicious that Avitan was a Mossad spy, but eventually accepted his explanation that he was there to settle a dispute with another criminal. The trial was postponed multiple times due to Avitan's demand for a Hebrew-language interpreter. One could not be found locally, and due to the lack of relations between Malaysia and Israel, a Hebrew interpreter could not be brought from the Jewish State. After numerous delays, Avitan opted to accept a plea deal of seven years in prison. Avitan is 'being held in difficult conditions,' a friend told Mako. 'The prisons in the country are that of a third-world country, and even worse. I hope for his sake that he survives prison.' The southeast Asian country maintains a hostile public stance towards Israel. In January 2025, Malaysia's Foreign Ministry 'unequivocally' condemned Israeli military activity in the Strip, claiming that the IDF engages in 'incessant and targeted' actions against civilians. In December 2023, Malaysia banned Israeli ships from docking at its ports due to the IDF's military campaign against Hamas.

Jewish rock star to Yarden Bibas: ‘Stay strong, brother’	May the memories of your beloved children and your wife, Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir, be a blessing to you. Always,' Disturbed's lead singer tells Yarden Bibas. By World Israel News Staff The lead singer of a prominent rock band recorded a heartfelt message to Yarden Bibas on Wednesday, after the bereaved father chose one of his songs to play at his family's funeral. The funeral of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas featured the song 'Hold On To The Memories' by the alternative metal band Disturbed. The band's lead singer and lyricist, David Draiman, is Jewish and a strong supporter of Israel. Draiman posted a video to his Instagram account, in which he directly addressed Yarden Bibas. 'Dear, dear Yarden. Shalom achi [hello my brother.] I am so, so very sorry for your loss. All of Am Israel [the Jewish people] is crying with you today. Hold on to the memories of your family, of your children, of your beloved wife. We all will,' Draiman said. 'As long as we hold them in our memory, they'll stay there. May the memories of your beloved children and your wife, Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir, be a blessing to you. Always,' he continued. 'Am Israel Chai achi [the people of Israel live.] Stay strong,' Draiman concluded. Since the onset of the October 7th war, Draiman has used social media to combat anti-Israel and pro-Hamas narratives. In March 2024, a video of Draiman speaking to the crowd at a Distrubed concert went viral, as he railed against the Hamas terror group. 'I miss people who were slaughtered like animals at the Nova Festival. Rape is not resistance. Slaughtering innocents at a music festival that brings together people from all walks of life is not resistance,' he said. 'I genuinely feel empathy for the Palestinian people. There is not a single Jew on this planet that does not celebrate life. We celebrate life. Hamas celebrates death and they need to be eradicated; not the Palestinians, Hamas.

Trump blasts ‘vicious’ Hamas, says phase 2 of ceasefire is up to ...	President Donald Trump expresses 'disappointment' that many of the hostages returned by Hamas were dead, says Israel must decide whether and how to proceed with phase two of the Gaza ceasefire. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump condemned Hamas on Wednesday, lamenting the fact that many of the hostages returned from the Gaza Strip are already dead. Speaking with reporters during a cabinet meeting – the first of his second term – Trump expressed his ‘disappointment’ that many of the hostages returned by Hamas were handed over to Israel dead. 'I'm very disappointed when I see four bodies came in today. These were young people - young people don't die. They [Hamas] think they're doing us a favor by sending us bodies,' Trump said. 'We got a lot of hostages back but it's very sad what happened to those people. We had a young lady with her hand practically blown off,' Trump said, referencing ex-hostage Emily Damari, who was wounded on October 7th. 'Do you know why it blew off? Because she put up her hand to try to stop a bullet that was coming her way.' The comments came shortly after Hamas transferred the remains of four slain Israeli hostages to the International Red Cross for return to Israel. The latest hostage return, which took place without the Gaza victory ceremonies seen previously, came after Israel suspended the release of Arab terrorists, in protest of the use of hostages in propaganda events. Trump condemned Hamas as a 'vicious group of people,' and appeared to leave the future of the Gaza ceasefire to Israel’s discretion. 'Israel is going to have to decide what they're doing. Phase one is going to be ending. Think of it, today they sent in four bodies - bodies!' The president echoed previous comments he made comparing the appearance of returning living captives to Holocaust survivors. 'When I saw the ones who came in two weeks ago, they looked like they just got out of a concentration camp. Then the following week a group came in and they weren't in as bad a shape.' 'I’ve spoken to a lot of parents and people involved. They want those bodies almost as much, if not more, than they want their son or daughter. It’s incredible the level of importance they place on bringing back the bodies.' Trump's comments come just days before the March 2nd deadline marking the end of the first phase of the hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire. Negotiations for implementing phase two are underway in Doha, Qatar, though the two sides are far from reaching a comprehensive agreement.

Israel working to ID slain captives’ bodies, terrorists released	Israel releasing terrorists in waves, as forensic testing continues to confirm identities of four slain hostages. By World Israel News Staff Israel is currently working to confirm the identities of four slain hostages' bodies returned by Hamas late Wednesday evening, as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are being released from Israeli detention. Unlike previous exchange, which saw Hamas hold a ghoulish ceremony featuring the public display of murdered captives' coffins in front of cheering crowds of Gazans, the terror group quietly transferred the remains of what it says are four Israelis kidnapped on October 7th to the Red Cross in Gaza. Previously, Israel had waited until all captives were back on Israeli soil before releasing prisoners, but began freeing terrorists within minutes of the bodies being received by the Red Cross. However, Israel is releasing the terrorists in waves of some 100 every few hours, and will presumably halt the process if the bodies are not positively identified. The release of the four slain captives' bodies triggered Israel to advance the release of some 600 terrorists, who were originally slated to be released last Saturday. Israel indefinitely postponed their release after Hamas held a public ceremony, which including forcing one of the kidnapped Israelis to kiss a terrorist on the forehead. The body of a Gazan woman, whom Hamas claimed it accidentally sent to Israel in place of Shiri Bibas last Thursday, was returned to the Strip. According to Hebrew-language media reports, 37 Palestinian prisoners were released to Ramallah in the early hours of Thursday morning. Videos circulating on social media showed raucous celebrations in the streets of the Palestinian Authority-administered city, as the freed prisoners were greeted with a hero's welcome. Five Palestinians convicted on terror charges were freed to eastern Jerusalem, including Hamza al-Kaluti A Hamas member sentenced to life for planning deadly suicide bombings, he served 24 years in prison before being freed to his home in eastern Jerusalem's Beit Hanina neighborhood. Some 97 prisoners were deported to Egypt.

Smotrich: Biden holding up arms caused serious problems for IDF	Smotrich: 'We had to use mechanical kits from the Yom Kippur War, some of which failed to detonate.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News At a financial conference on Wednesday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich discussed the issues caused by the Biden Administration's delay in providing arms to Israel. Smotrich stated, 'Due to the American embargo, which prevented us from receiving bomb kits, we had to use mechanical kits from the Yom Kippur War, some of which failed to detonate.' He added, 'Now, Hamas is utilizing them. However, the real danger of this deal is the message it sends: that anyone who wants to defeat the State of Israel and bring it to its knees only needs to kidnap Jews.' US President Joe Biden has faced pressure from within the Democratic Party to impose an arms embargo on Israel. Democratic lawmakers penned a letter in December 2024 stating that, despite the administration’s statement in November declaring Israel to be in compliance with the law, they believe the IDF 'failed to meet' the standards set by American regulations. 'We believe continuing to transfer offensive weapons to the Israeli government prolongs the suffering of the Palestinian people and risks our own national security by sending a message to the world that the US will apply its laws, policies, and international law selectively,' the letter said. Smotrich also criticized the current hostage deal, which is approaching its second phase. 'While we are excited about the return of each and every hostage, this deal is detrimental. It involves the release of hundreds of murderous terrorists who, according to all statistics, are determined to return to killing Jews.' 'It also leads to the rehabilitation of the Hamas leadership, both in Israel and abroad, and the exit from the Netzarim Corridor,' Smotrich added. 'In phase two, there is a red line that has not yet been crossed and must not be crossed&#8230; a declaration of the end of the war,' Smotrich warned, saying that such a declaration could lead to the establishment of a Palestinian State and the expulsion of Jews from Judea and Samaria.

Just 33% of Democrats have a favorable view of Israel, Gallup pol...	The poll demonstrates that, in the span of three years, Democratic favorability ratings for Israel have plummeted 30 points. By Ben Sales, JTA Just a third of Democrats have a favorable view of Israel, a steep decline from just a few years ago, according to a Gallup poll. That’s in contrast to 83% of Republicans who view Israel favorably — a partisan gap of 50 points. Responding to the results, Jewish Democratic leaders said they remained confident in their party’s pro-Israel bona fides — though one sounded notes of caution. Jewish Republicans celebrated the poll. The poll, published on Monday, is the latest stark sign that Democrats are losing their love for Israel. Previous polls taken during the Israel-Hamas war have shown that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to blame Israel for the fighting and to be more sympathetic to the Palestinians than to the Israelis. And the gap in this week’s poll shows that, after decades during which Israel was seen as a bipartisan issue, there is now a chasm between how voters from both parties view the country. The poll’s analysis attributed the gap to the Israel-Hamas war as well as polarization over President Donald Trump. 'The 50 points separating Republican and Democratic positivity toward Israel shatters the prior record of 30 points measured last year,' the Gallup page says. 'The widening partisan gap likely reflects Democrats’ opposition to Israel’s actions in the Israel-Hamas war. It could also be a reaction to Trump’s strong backing of Israel, highlighted in his meeting with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House earlier this month.' The poll demonstrates that, in the span of three years, Democratic favorability ratings for Israel have plummeted 30 points. In 2022, 63% of Democrats viewed Israel favorably The number dropped to 56% in 2023 and 47% in 2024 — following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack and the ensuing war in Gaza — before falling to 33% this year. The percentage of independents who view Israel favorably has also plunged in that time, from 71% in 2022 to 48% this year. The Republican numbers have remained about level during that time, going from 81% to 83%. Sixty percent of Democrats have an unfavorable view of Israel, the first time most of a partisan group has felt that way. Among independents, the unfavorable figure was 44%. Gallup did not share unfavorable numbers for Republicans. 'There’s no question Israel’s image has suffered among both Democrats and independents over the course of the war, and that’s a fact and its a problem,' said Mark Mellman, president of the Democratic Majority for Israel advocacy group. 'Theres a fight going on in the Democratic Party. It’s a hard fight.' Asked what she makes of the declining numbers, Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, attributed the drop to negative opinions of Netanyahu, who has embraced Trump’s proposals. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu’s close alignment with Donald Trump has clouded the way some see Israel,' she said in a statement. 'While Netanyahu is undoubtedly a polarizing figure, Jewish Democrats know that the U.S.-Israel relationship transcends any individual leader.' But both Soifer and Mellman pointed to reasons they were optimistic, mentioning the large majority of Democratic officials who are pro-Israel. Soifer also noted the Jewish vote in last year’s presidential election, which went solidly for Vice President Kamala Harris. She accused Trump of 'using and manipulating the [U.S.-Israel] relationship to further his own agenda.' 'Democratic leaders have never wavered in their support of Israel — including their initiation and support of historic levels of military aid to Israel during the Biden administration,' she said. 'The vast majority of Jewish Americans are both Democrats and pro-Israel, and proudly support a U.S.-Israel relationship that transcends any individual leader, whether they be in the U.S. or Israel.' Mellman, who is also a pollster, cited a poll his firm conducted ahead of the Democratic convention last year, in which 62% of Democrats said the United States should support Israel, versus just 7% who opted for Hamas — numbers close to the national average. 'Jews still consider the Democratic party to be a pro-Israel party, and they’re right — we had a pro-Israel platform, we had a pro-Israel Democratic president until this year,' he said. 'There’s no question that the Democratic Party remains pro-Israel.' The Republican Jewish Coalition begged to differ — pointing to an increasing Jewish Republican vote share, if still a minority, in the 2024 election. 'President Donald J. Trump received a historic share of the Jewish vote in 2024, as Democrats continue to hemorrhage support from the American Jewish community,' the group tweeted above a graph of the poll. 'The numbers don’t lie: there is only ONE pro-Israel party, and it is the GOP.'

Terror group leader who trained Columbia students on ‘Palestinian...	She also praised Iran—Hezbollah’s backer—as 'a nation on the side of the Palestinian people, intervening and building a movement of resistance to free this entire region … from U.S. imperialism.' By Jessica Costescu, The Washington Free Beacon Among a crowd mourning Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah's death and chanting 'Death to Israel, death to America' in Beirut on Sunday was Charlotte Kates, a leader of the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, which the United States sanctioned for providing financial support to terrorists. Just last spring, she was instructing Columbia University students on 'Palestinian resistance' tactics. Tens of thousands of black-clad mourners flooded the funeral at Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, Lebanon’s largest sports arena. They vowed support for Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group that began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with its ally, Hamas, following the latter’s Oct. 7 massacre of Israeli civilians. Israel, in response to Hezbollah’s assaults, invaded Lebanon and killed Nasrallah on Sept. 27, 2024. 'It is such an honor to be here in Beirut today, one among a sea of over a million people in collective tribute, mourning, love and commitment to the road of resistance and liberation exemplified by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hisham Safieddine,' Kates posted to X on Sunday with photos of the crowd. Samidoun leader Charlotte Kates (Workers World Party/YouTube) 'The masses are truly out in the streets, affirming the indelible living legacy of the great anti-imperialist leader of our day, the great Arab and international revolutionary, the beloved speaker of truth and warrior of justice,' Kates, Samidoun’s international coordinator, added. In October, the United States sanctioned Samidoun and Kates’s husband, Khaled Barakat, for providing support to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a terrorist organization that participated in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack. Less than a year before Nasrallah’s funeral, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD)—the Ivy League school’s most notorious anti-Semitic student group—invited Kates and Barakat, a PFLP member, to deliver speeches on 'the fight for liberation,' as part of a lecture titled 'Palestinian Resistance 101.' Shortly after the event, which the Washington Free Beacon attended virtually, Columbia student radicals launched the anti-Israel encampment and eventually stormed a campus building. In November, a month after the sanctions were issued, CUAD passed out pamphlets just outside Columbia's Morningside Heights gates encouraging attendees to 'get involved' with Samidoun. They included a QR code that sent users to Samidoun's website, which touts an 'Amsterdam free from Zionism' and calls to 'globalize the intifada!' 'The fact is that October 7 changed the world … we saw the potential of a future for Palestine liberated from Zionism,' Kates told a group of keffiyeh-clad Columbia students during her March 24 speech. She also praised Iran—Hezbollah’s backer—as 'a nation on the side of the Palestinian people, intervening and building a movement of resistance to free this entire region … from U.S. imperialism.' She advocated for a campaign to eliminate America's list of designated terror organizations. 'It is important to popularize campaigns to … scrap the U.S. terror list entirely, or at the very least to get Palestinian, Lebanese, Yemeni, Filipino, and other revolutionary organizations off the terror list,' Kates said. 'Because that's a weapon that's being used against the Palestinian people, against the Arab people, and against the solidarity movement as a whole, and in order to kind of fundamentally deform the politics of the movement.' In August, Kates traveled to Tehran where Iran awarded her the 'Eighth Annual Islamic Human Rights and Human Dignity Award.' Other recipients included Hamas head Ismail Haniyeh and Ziyad al-Nakhalah, the secretary general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a U.S.-designated terror group. Barakat, meanwhile, explicitly endorsed terrorism against Jews during his own lecture for CUAD and lauded airplane hijackings as 'one of the most important tactics that the Palestinian resistance have engaged in.' Barakat is not the only person to have glorified plane hijackings at Columbia. In October, Joseph Slaughter, a member of Columbia’s top disciplinary body and an English professor who defended the illegal encampment at the Ivy League school, delivered a lecture that lauded a string of terrorist plane hijackings as 'spectacular' and 'remarkable,' the Free Beacon reported. CUAD has continued to terrorize campus. Last month, for example, anti-Israel radicals dumped cement into a campus building’s sewage system. A week earlier, pro-Hamas agitators stormed an Israeli history class and targeted Jewish students with anti-Semitic flyers.

Iran rejects nuclear talks with US as Trump admin ramps up ‘maxim...	Iran’s so-called 'supreme leader,' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the idea of negotiating with Washington, calling such a move 'unwise' and 'dishonorable.' By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Tuesday rejected the possibility of nuclear talks with the United States, which imposed new sanctions on Iran’s oil industry as part of the Trump administration’s so-called 'maximum pressure' campaign against Tehran. 'There will be no possibility of direct talks between us and the United States on the nuclear issue as long as the maximum pressure is applied in this way,' Araghchi said during a joint press conference with his visiting Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. 'We will not negotiate under pressure, threat, or sanctions,' he added. The top Iranian official’s remarks came a day after the US Treasury Department announced new sanctions on Iran’s oil industry, targeting over 30 brokers, tanker operators, and shipping companies involved in transporting and selling Iranian petroleum. The new oil sanctions were the latest to be imposed since US President Donald Trump reinstated his 'maximum pressure' policy toward Tehran, aiming to cut the country’s crude exports to zero and prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Earlier this month, however, Trump also expressed a willingness to talk to Iran’s leaders, stating his desire to reach a 'nuclear peace agreement' to improve bilateral relations with Tehran while insisting that the Iranian regime must not develop a nuclear weapon. Iran’s so-called 'supreme leader,' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the idea of negotiating with Washington, calling such a move 'unwise' and 'dishonorable.' Tuesday’s high-level meeting between Russian and Iranian officials took place in Tehran to discuss bilateral relations, regional developments, and the 2015 nuclear deal with major world powers that placed temporary restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. 'On the nuclear issue, we will move forward with the cooperation and coordination of our friends in Russia and China,' Araghchi said during the press conference. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the views of both Russian and Iranian officials were in alignment regarding Iran’s nuclear program. 'Positions were aligned on the situation around the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action [the official name for the 2015 nuclear deal] on the Iranian nuclear program,' it said. Iran has claimed that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes rather than building weapons. However, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported last year that Iran had greatly accelerated uranium enrichment to up to 60 percent purity, close to the roughly 90 percent weapons-grade level. At the time, the UK, France, and Germany said in a statement that there is no 'credible civilian justification' for Tehran’s recent nuclear activity, arguing it 'gives Iran the capability to rapidly produce sufficient fissile material for multiple nuclear weapons.' As Russia also faces increasing sanctions from the West over its war in Ukraine, Moscow and Tehran have deepened their cooperation. Ukraine and its allies have accused Iran of supplying weapons to Russia, allegations Tehran has denied. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian signed a 20-year 'comprehensive strategic partnership treaty' reinforcing their economic and military cooperation. The bilateral cooperation between Tehran and Moscow comes at a time when Iran’s influence in the Middle East is waning, with the fall of long-time Iranian ally Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Israel’s military successes against two of Iran’s terrorist proxies: Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. After the collapse of Assad’s regime, which was driven by an offensive led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, both Russia and Iran suffered a major setback in Syria despite years of investment in supporting their longtime ally during the civil war. 'Iran wants peace, stability, preservation of territorial integrity and unity, and the progress of Syria based on the will of the people,' Araghchi said on Tuesday, referring to Damascus’s new government. During the press conference, Lavrov also referred to Syria’s new regime, saying, 'We will do our utmost to ensure that the situation calms down and does not pose a threat either to the Syrian people … or to the people of neighboring states.'

International Red Cross, facing GOP criticism over Hamas propagan...	The ICRC sparked outrage when, roughly two weeks ago, officials Nour Khadam and Stephanie Eller joined uniformed Hamas terrorists on stage to participate in a propaganda ceremony surrounding the release of Israeli hostages. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Just days after the Washington Free Beacon detailed mounting congressional concerns over the International Committee of the Red Cross's (ICRC) participation in a series of shocking Hamas hostage release ceremonies, an official from the aid agency approached the publication about advertising with the Free Beacon and sponsoring our daily newsletter, the Morning Beacon. 'Looking to see if I can get more info on newsletter sponsorship or online ads,' the ICRC's head of communications and public affairs, Steve Dorsey, wrote the Free Beacon on Monday. Five days earlier, the Free Beacon reported on Senate Republicans' outrage over the participation of ICRC officials in Hamas propaganda rituals and their desire to reassess U.S. funding to the organization. The ICRC's advertisement inquiry suggests it may be spooked by those talks and looking to shore up support on Capitol Hill. Dorsey told the Free Beacon that the ICRC has not 'traditionally done much advertising' and hoped to run spots that would link to its website and boost 'generic ICRC visibility.' A Free Beacon review of Meta's ad spending database found that the ICRC ran just five Facebook ads between 2019 and 2023. It did ramp up ad spending at the end of 2024 and beginning of 2025, running a series of Facebook and Instagram spots on the 'rules of war' that call for the protection of 'detainees,' 'families,' and 'civilians.' The committee failed to do that job when it did not follow through on its obligation to visit hostages in Hamas captivity or to lodge complaints if and when they were denied that right. None of those ads remain active, and all of them ran in Europe, according to the database. The United States is the ICRC's top patron, meaning the committee is tapping into a budget that includes U.S. taxpayer funds to advertise at a time when those funds are under threat. Dorsey did not answer questions on the committee's broader ad campaign and the motivations behind it. Instead, he encouraged 'Free Beacon readers to review' a Monday ICRC op-ed published in the Washington Examiner, which called the Hamas hostage transfers 'disturbing and dehumanizing' but did not address the group's failure to visit Israeli hostages in captivity. The ICRC sparked outrage when, roughly two weeks ago, officials Nour Khadam and Stephanie Eller joined uniformed Hamas terrorists on stage to participate in a propaganda ceremony surrounding the release of Israeli hostages. The pair signed documents and shook hands with masked Hamas terrorists. Last week, the ICRC again dispatched a staffer to sign documents alongside a Hamas terrorist on a stage that included an anti-Semitic sign depicting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a bloodthirsty vampire. The sign also accused Netanyahu of killing the Bibas children, Ariel and Kfir, in an airstrike. An Israeli forensic review found that Hamas terrorists murdered four-year-old Ariel and nine-month-old Kfir 'with their bare hands.' While the Red Cross agreed to participate in those hostage release ceremonies, it did not visit the hostages during their time in captivity to assess their health, as the group routinely does during traditional conflicts. 'We continue to request information on the hostages and for access to them. We also continue to insist that they be able to share a message with their families,' the organization says on its website. 'Years of experience speaking with parties to conflicts and non-state armed groups have proven that our bilateral approach and confidential dialogue to raise issues of concern is important to achieve results, rather than public denunciations.' The ICRC's website, which the committee intended to promote in its ads with the Free Beacon, nonetheless touts its status as a 'neutral, impartial, and independent' organization that takes 'action, not sides.' It also includes an 'Israel-Gaza Emergency Appeal' that includes a photo of Gazan rubble and no photos of the Israeli hostages. 'The ICRC continues to do everything within our power to support people affected by the conflict, including trying all possible means to get aid, including critical health care, into Gaza, and persistently advocating on behalf of hostages being held in Gaza,' the appeal states. The ICRC has released public statements on the hostage ceremonies that refer to 'Israel and the occupied territories' and do not mention Hamas by name. In one February 19 statement, the organization urged 'dignity and privacy ahead of next release operation.' The next day, Hamas terrorists carried caskets holding the bodies of the Bibas children through the streets of Gaza as Palestinian onlookers cheered and enjoyed upbeat music.

Deal reached for return of captives’ remains ‘without Hamas cerem...	Egypt, acting as a mediator, confirmed the breakthrough and said it will oversee the exchange, reportedly scheduled to take place at 11 p.m. local time on Wednesday. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office confirmed that an agreement had been reached with Hamas on Wednesday to resolve the delay in Jerusalem’s release of some 600 Palestinian terrorists as part of the ceasefire deal. Following Israeli demands, 'a deal was reached with the mediators: our four fallen hostages will be returned tonight as part of Phase 1, under an agreed procedure and without Hamas ceremonies,' the PMO stated. Under the deal, the prisoners are set to be freed simultaneously with the transfer to Israel by Hamas of four Israeli hostages’ remains, completing Phase 1 of the ceasefire agreement, according to Channel 12 News. Egypt, acting as a mediator, confirmed the breakthrough and said it will oversee the exchange, reportedly scheduled to take place at 11 p.m. local time on Wednesday. Gaza’s Hamas-affiliated Quds News Network also reported that the transfer would occur under Egyptian supervision. Israeli officials were updating the families of the deceased hostages expected to be returned on Wednesday, Ynet reported. According to Hamas, it was preparing to return the bodies of slain Israeli captives Tsahi Idan, Ohad Yahalomi, Itzik Elgarat and Shlomo Mansour. The hostages’ remains were initially set to be released on Thursday in accordance with the terms of the ceasefire agreement with Jerusalem. The Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades, a terrorist group in the Gaza Strip affiliated with Hamas, previously announced on its official Telegram channel that it would release the body of Yahalomi on Thursday. Israel was set to free the prisoners on Feb. 22, including 50 serving life sentences, 60 serving long terms and 47 who were rearrested after being released as part of the 2011 swap for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday that he had temporarily paused the Palestinian prisoners’ release 'in light of Hamas’s repeated violations [of the ceasefire], including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes.' U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes described Netanyahu’s decision as an 'appropriate response' to Hamas’s actions, according to Reuters. Hughes stressed that U.S. President Donald Trump was ready to back Jerusalem in 'whatever course of action it chooses regarding Hamas.' On Monday night, Channel 12 News reported that the bodies of two slain hostages would be transferred to Egyptian territory 'within 24 hours' in exchange for the release of 302 jailed Palestinian terrorists. According to the report, Hamas agreed to release the bodies of two more deceased Israeli captives later in exchange for the remaining prisoners. The return this week of the remains of four hostages would be the final exchange of Phase 1 of the ceasefire, which took effect on Jan. 19 and is due to end on March 1. According to Israel’s assessment, there are 63 hostages remaining in Gaza, including 60 men and 3 women. Thirty-six of the captives have been murdered, including 35 from Oct. 7 and Hadar Goldin, abducted in 2014. Israel to send delegation for next phase of hostage deal U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff announced on Tuesday that Israel will send a delegation to Doha or Cairo to advance Phase 2 of the hostage deal. Speaking at an American Jewish Committee meeting in Washington, he highlighted significant progress and efforts to secure the release of more hostages. Witkoff added that he may join the talks if they yield positive results. Israeli sources indicated to Israel Hayom that Hamas faces three possible paths: surrender, disarmament, and exile to bring the war to an end; prolonging the initial phase through further hostage exchanges for prisoners and increased humanitarian aid; or a return to full-scale combat. Discussions on the return of the remaining hostages are set to begin in Cairo in the coming days, but only after Israel recovers the bodies. Israel intends to send a delegation to these talks, building on the groundwork established over the past two weeks in the U.S. between Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Witkoff. Despite the terms of the agreement, the Israel Defense Forces are not expected to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor or the security perimeter in the near future—if at all.

7,000 terrorist attacks in Judea and Samaria in 2024	Israelis subjected to an average of 20 terror attacks per day in Judea and Samaria last year, with hundreds of bombings, nearly 180 shootings, hundreds of fire bombings, and dozens of stabbing and ramming attacks. By World Israel News Staff Palestinian Arab terrorists carried out or attempted close to 7,000 attacks on Israelis in Judea and Samaria last year, according to a report by the emergency aid group SSF Rescuers Without Borders – Judea and Samaria. According to the report, released on Tuesday, during 2024, there were an average of roughly 20 attacks or attempted attacks per day in Judea and Samaria alone, not including attacks in or from the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, or inside the State of Israel proper. The attacks left a total of 27 people dead and 306 injured, the SSF Rescuers Without Borders report said. More than half of the attacks were rock-throwing incidents, with 3,668 such attacks being reported out on roads across Judea and Samaria last year. Fire bombings and Molotov cocktail attacks were also common, with 843 such attacks reported in 2024, for an average of 2.3 every day. There were 671 reported instances of Palestinian Arabs using laser devices to blind Israeli drivers in attempts to cause them to become disoriented and crash. A total of 526 conventional bombing attacks were reported – excluding firebombs, incendiary devices, or attacks using gas tanks. Israelis reported 179 shooting attacks across Judea and Samaria last year, along with 364 arson attacks or bombings using gas tanks. In three dozen cases, bottles or bags of paint were thrown at Israeli vehicles, in order to obscure their windshields and cause the driver to crash. There were 37 stabbing attacks – 9 of which were successful – and 19 vehicular ramming attacks, 12 of which were successful. In addition, Arab terrorists violently assaulted Israelis in 15 different incidents involving carjackings.

‘A miracle’ – Divine providence behind failure of Tel Aviv bus bo...	A journalist and strategic analyst from the United Arab Emirates rips Palestinian Authority following botched bombing of Israeli buses, calls terrorists' mistake 'divine intervention.' By World Israel News Staff An Arab journalist took aim at the Palestinian Authority after a botched bomb attack in Tel Aviv destroyed three buses, following Israel's decision to permit Arab workers from Judea and Samaria into Israel. A cell of Palestinian Arab terrorists operating in the Tel Aviv area planted explosives on five empty buses overnight last Thursday in the city of Bat Yam. Due to a mistake in the timing programmed into the bombs' detonators, three of the bombs went off in the middle of the night, destroying the buses, while causing no casualties. Two of the five targeted buses were unscathed. It was later revealed that the terrorists had accidentally set the detonation time for PM. rather than AM, causing the bombs to explode while the buses were sitting in a depot overnight, instead of during morning rush hour. On Friday, a day after the bombings, Amjad Taha, a pro-Israel strategist and journalist from the United Arab Emirates, said the attack reflected poorly on the Palestinian Authority, noting that prior to the bombing, Israel had approved work permits for Palestinian Arabs for the Tel Aviv area. 'And to think, Israel agreed to the Palestinian Authority’s request to allow their workers into Tel Aviv. This is how some of them repaid that trust,' Taha tweeted. Taha, author of The Deception of the Arab Spring, also hailed the failure of the terrorists to properly set the detonators as a 'miracle' and 'divine intervention' protecting the intended targets. 'When God chooses to protect you, He bends time itself, turning AM into PM,' Taha continued. 'Was it divine intervention or sheer hatred blinding them? Palestinian Islamist terrorists from the West Bank set their bomb for PM instead of AM, an attack meant to slaughter Israeli women and children during the morning rush, only to detonate in an empty parking lot. A mistake or a miracle?'

Olmert reveals 2008 map conceding 94% of Judea & Samaria to PA	The former prime minister told the BBC that he had exclaimed, 'Sign it and let’s change history!' to Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas, who refused. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Sixteen years after presenting a secret map to Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas that conceded 94% of Judea and Samaria in exchange for a peace agreement, former prime minister Ehud Olmert has revealed it to the BBC. In an interview to be shown as part of the British broadcaster’s upcoming series called 'Israel and the Palestinians: The Road to 7th October,' Olmert said that he met with Abbas in Jerusalem on September 16, 2008, showed him the map and implored him to approve it immediately. 'Sign it! Sign it, and let’s change history!' he recalled saying. 'This is the first time that I expose this map to the media,' he noted to the director, Norma Percy. While according to Olmert, Abbas had responded by saying that this was a 'very serious' proposal, the Palestinian leader never got back to him about it. Rafiq al-Husseini, Abbas’ then-chief of staff, said in the documentary that the Palestinian delegation had laughed off the plan in the ride back to Ramallah, because they 'knew this wasn’t going anywhere,' since Olmert 'was a lame duck,' having already told the public that he was going to resign amidst a corruption investigation against him. The diagram envisioned Israel annexing only 4.9% of the heartland of the country that had been liberated in the 1967 Six Day War, encompassing only a few main settlement blocs. The Palestinians would receive equivalent areas in pre-1967 Israel to make up the difference by adding land abutting the borders of both Gaza and Judea and Samaria. Under Olmert's proposal a whopping 58,000 Jews would have been evacuated from all the other villages and towns in the territory. This was over seven times the number of Jewish residents of the Gaza Strip who were forced out of their homes in the 2005 Disengagement in a process that had torn the country apart, and whose resettlement had barely begun, even three years later. There was a tunnel or road marked off to connect the Gaza Strip to the main PA territory in Judea and Samaria, although the coastal enclave was already controlled by the Hamas terror organization. In total negation of Israel’s official and long-held position, Jerusalem was to be divided, with each party claiming parts of it as its capital. A 'trusteeship committee' consisting of Israel, the PA, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the U.S. were to oversee the administration of the 'holy basin' of the Old City and its religious sites. Olmert said he had told Abbas, 'For the next 50 years, you won’t find a single Israeli leader who will offer you what I’m offering now.' Although there has been for decades a Jewish 'peace camp' in Israel that was prepared to give up a large part of Judea and Samaria, either with or without parts of Jerusalem, in order to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, since the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led terrorist invasion in which they slaughtered 1,200 and took 251 people hostage, this leftist voice has been silenced. In a January survey by Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), 64% of the Jews polled opposed the creation of a Palestinian state 'under any condition,' and a third supported Israeli annexation of the Gaza Strip. Another poll, taken right before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met U.S. President Donald Trump early this month, showed even greater opposition, with 71% opposing a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria and almost 70% saying they want to extend Israeli sovereignty over this territory. Last July, the Israeli parliament overwhelmingly voted to reject Palestinian statehood in any form. 'The Israeli Knesset opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state on any piece of land west of the Jordan River,' the resolution reads. 'The existence of a Palestinian state in the heart of Israel will pose an existential threat to the State of Israel and its citizens, will further extend the Israel-Palestinian Arab conflict and be a source of destabilization for the entire region.'

‘Shaken to the core’: Wife of slain hostage mourns betrayal after...	Yocheved was also abducted from their home on the kibbutz. She and hostage Nurit Cooper were freed after 17 days of captivity. By Pesach Benson, TPS Speaking at the funeral of murdered hostage Oded Lifshitz, Israeli President asked forgiveness from the family and Kibbutz Nir Oz, and reiterated calls for a commission of inquiry on Tuesday. 'I stand here, facing the foothills of your land, and as the President of the State of Israel, on behalf of the State of Israel – I ask you – beloved Oded, respected and from your dear family – forgiveness. Forgiveness that the State of Israel did not protect you, your family and your kibbutz. Forgiveness that you are forced to stand alone in the face of human monsters. Forgiveness that we did not have time to save and return you and all your friends – from the jaws of the murderers, here, home, in peace. Forgiveness,' Herzog said. 'I humbly ask for this forgiveness from you too – the brave and noble friends and members of Kibbutz Nir Oz. As the President of the State of Israel, I ask in this painful and agonizing situation to bow my head to you too and ask forgiveness from all of you: Forgiveness that we were not here for you on that cursed day. Forgiveness for the omission and the eclipse of the lights that you paid, and we all paid, such a terrible price.' Lifshitz, 84, was a retired journalist, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz in 1955, and a peace activist. He was known for volunteering for 'Road to Recovery,' a non-governmental organization that transports Palestinian children with medical conditions to Israeli hospitals for treatment. His wife, Yocheved was also abducted from their home on the kibbutz. She and hostage Nurit Cooper were freed after 17 days of captivity. 'Our abduction and your death shake me to the core. We fought for years for peace and social justice – unfortunately, we were dealt a harsh blow by the very people we helped on the other side,' Yocheved said. Herzog also renewed his call for a commission of inquiry to investigate the failures that led to Hamas’s attack on October 7. 'I once again call for the establishment of a state commission of inquiry, which is the royal road of a reformed state – to delve boldly and professionally into everything that caused the failure and the terrible disaster. This is a critical milestone in the journey towards healing, rehabilitation, and building the state and society – after the terrible disaster,' he said. On Sunday, the High Court of Justice gave the government a deadline of May 11 to update the court on its position on forming a formal state commission of inquiry. This was in response to a petition filed by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, which sought the court to order the commission’s forming. There have been growing calls for the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to investigate political and military failures. Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. They may include personal recommendations about individuals under investigation, though the government is not bound to act on the recommendations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other government ministers say a state inquiry into failings that led to Hamas’s October 7 attacks should only be held after the war. Critics accuse Netanyahu of delaying the inquiry and trying to water down the powers of a commission. The last state commission of inquiry, which investigated Israel’s worst civilian disaster — a stampede that killed 45 people at a holy site on Mount Meron — held Netanyahu personally responsible for the tragedy in a report released in April. The military presented its own inquiry to Defense Minister Israel Katz. That probe only dealt with operational and command issues and not political decisions. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 63 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

British court rules against antisemitic Pink Floyd frontman in de...	The case could go to trial to determine damages, though barrister Simon Myerson predicted that Waters and Al Jazeera will settle with Ware. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon A British court determined in a preliminary ruling that Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters defamed John Ware, a veteran journalist who made a documentary critical of Waters's anti-Semitic history when he called Ware a 'lying, conniving Zionist mouthpiece' who supports the 'genocide of the Palestinian people.' The development puts both Waters and the Hamas-friendly network Al Jazeera on the hook for damages. In the Tuesday ruling, the British High Court of Justice found that Waters's 'statements are defamatory' because they were offered as fact, not opinion. The decision sets the stage for Ware to receive financial compensation not just from Waters but also from Al Jazeera, the Arab network funded in large part by the Hamas-friendly nation of Qatar. Waters's comments targeting Ware came during a 2024 interview on the Al Jazeera network, which Ware sued in addition to Waters. The case could go to trial to determine damages, though barrister Simon Myerson predicted that Waters and Al Jazeera will settle with Ware. Ware, a documentarian who produced a 2023 film examining Waters’s vast anti-Israel advocacy, sued the musician and Al Jazeera last year. Waters appeared on Al Jazeera to bash Ware’s film and accused the journalist of 'cheerleading the genocide of the Palestinian people like almost more than anyone else on earth.' Ware’s documentary, The Dark Side of Roger Waters, was produced for the Campaign Against Antisemitism, a British nonprofit that combats Jew hatred. In it, Ware examined the singer’s long history of anti-Israel activism and embrace of anti-Semitic imagery. Waters, for instance, dressed in Nazi regalia during a 2023 show and displayed an inflatable pig emblazoned with Jewish stars. Ware’s documentary detailed the musician’s plans to add other slogans and symbols to the pig, including 'dirty kike,' 'follow the money,' and 'scum.' His Nazi cosplay earned a rare rebuke from the Biden administration State Department, which described Waters as having a 'long track record of using antisemitic tropes to denigrate Jewish people.' In the wake of Oct. 7, Waters said Hamas's terror attack was justified and accused Israel of 'making up stories' about widespread rape and torture on that day. 'Was it justified for [Hamas] to resist the occupation? Yeah,' Waters said just a month after the attack. 'They are absolutely legally and morally bound to resist the occupation since 1967.' Referring to reports that Hamas raped women, killed babies, and tortured civilians during its rampage through Israel, Waters downplayed the revelations. 'We don't yet know what happened,' he said at the time. 'Maybe there were some individual cases of civilians getting killed.' Waters is also a leading supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, an anti-Semitic global campaign to wage economic warfare on the Jewish state.

The mother of freed hostage Liri Albag on what her daughter endur...	Liri learned Arabic, studied her captors’ psychology, and knew when to speak and when to stay silent. She did not resist, did not rebel—she survived. By Hugh Fitzgerald, Frontpage Magazine Shiri Albag is the mother of the recently-freed hostage Liri Albag. Her daughter suffered in captivity, but says that the 'men had it [even] worse.' More on her long captivity, and her slow recuperation at home, and above all, her observations on those 'innocent Gazan civilians,' can be found here: '‘The girls suffered, but men suffer more’: Shira Albag speaks about Liri’s time in captivity,' by Liam Dev and Maya Cohen, Jerusalem Post, February 13, 2025: After 477 days of uncertainty, endless prayers, and relentless struggle, Shira Albag wakes up from a dream—only this time, it is not a nightmare. She is finally waking up next to her daughter, Liri. 'You know, waking up with your daughter after so long, feeling her presence—it’s overwhelming,' she says. 'I keep telling myself, I’m in a dream.' Liri Albag, the IDF lookout soldier kidnapped from the Nahal Oz outpost on October 7, has not returned to the life she once knew. She is no longer the same girl who enlisted a year and a half ago. Despite the smiles and reunions with friends, something in her has changed. 'Yes and no,' Shira says when asked if her daughter is starting to return to herself. 'The moment I saw Liri and she shouted at us, ‘Liri Number 1’—our private joke at home—I thought, that’s my daughter. I was afraid of what I would get back, but it’s her. It’s my Liri.' Yet for every joyful moment, there are silent ones—the realization that the road ahead is long. 'She’s grown up a lot,' Shira says, her voice heavy. 'She understands so much, but she’s also very quiet at times. On one hand, she talks a lot, but on the other, it’s like everything is mixed together.' It turns out Liri did not just survive—she found a way to navigate through hell. 'The moment she was taken, she realized her reality. She was now a hostage in Gaza, and she would learn to survive.' Survival was not a choice; it was instinct. '‘I’ll play their game, but I’ll outsmart them,’ she told me,' Shira recalls. Liri learned Arabic, studied her captors’ psychology, and knew when to speak and when to stay silent. She did not resist, did not rebel—she survived…. And Liri Albag not only survived, but helped other Israelis to survive. Another hostage released earlier, Amit Soussana, described how Liri had saved her life, by convincing Soussana’s captors that she was not a soldier. Soldiers who were being held hostage received the cruelest treatment from Hamas; some — we don’t know how many — were executed. When Shira remembers the day her daughter was taken, anger fills her voice. 'There’s so much anger about October 7,' she admits. 'Not toward the soldiers who fought bravely, but toward the fact that no one was there who knew what to do. They sat there for hours—nearly four hours—watching their friends… some were still alive. If someone had come, they could have been saved.' There was a terrible failure of Israeli intelligence leading up to the October 7 attacks. Signals that had been picked up by Israeli intelligence, about a possible large-scale cross-border operation by Hamas, were unaccountably ignored by the leaders of the IDF. In fact, two IDF commando companies were diverted to Judea and Samaria from the Gaza border just days before the onslaught. There were IDF lookouts, like 19-year-old Liri Albag, but only a handful of soldiers to guard the kibbutzim, and only private security guards to protect the party-goers at the Nova music festival. They waited at the kibbutzim as 6,000 Hamas members, accompanied by hundreds of Gazan civilians eager to watch or even join in the fun, including the looting of Israeli homes, poured into Israel from Gaza for the IDF. But it took four hours before the IDF finally arrived, many hours too late. 1,200 Israelis had been subject to torture, rape, mutilation, before being murdered, and 251 Israelis had been taken back to Gaza as hostages where, like Liri Albag, they were subject to every sort of physical and mental torment. It wasn’t just Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad who held Israelis captive. It was also those people we call 'innocent civilians' who held some of the hostages captive in their homes. 'The so-called uninvolved civilians' — including even their 'little children' — took part in holding Israelis captive. The most important message, repeated three times in this brief interview with Liri Albag’s mother, is that not just Hamas combatants, but all the people in Gaza, including children, are implicated in the holding of hostages. Some civilians kept the hostages, as domestic or sex slaves, in their homes. In Shira Albag’s estimation, there are no 'innocent' Gazans; they all supported Hamas’ attack, and were delighted to learn of the atrocities inflicted by 6,000 Hamas operatives on October 7. These 'innocent civilians' ran beside the motorcycles and flatbed trucks on which Israelis were carried back into Gaza, beating the terrified and often wounded men, women, and children. In every encounter with the hostages inside Gaza during the sixteen months of war, those 'innocent civilians' exhibited the same cruelty as Hamas members. That is why Shiri Albag says that 'unfortunately, there are two million terrorists in Gaza. Two million. Liri was in their homes, and the children — yes, even the children — are part of this. It’s not just those carrying rifles and wearing green headbands. The so-called uninvolved civilians are not uninvolved at all. And, unfortunately, we’re going to have to fight them all.'

Cruz: ‘Israel’s right to Judea and Samaria starts in the Bible’	He expressed sympathy for the 'unfathomable trauma' Israel and the Jewish people endure as 'Palestinian savages make the return of every hostage, living or murdered, an ongoing nightmare.' By JNS Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Tuesday expressed his long-held support for Israel and what he said was its biblically rooted right to its historic homeland in Judea and Samaria Addressing the Sovereignty Conference 2025 in Jerusalem on Tuesday via video, Cruz reiterated his long-held position that Israel has an 'absolute right to determine what happens in Judea and Samaria.' That right 'starts in the Bible and extends through modern times,' he added. Thanking Yesha Council chairman Israel Gantz for his work to strengthen the U.S.-Israel alliance, Cruz said, 'As you meet today, have confidence that the American people stand with you. And under President Trump and our new Republican Congress, the American government stands with you as well.' The Yesha Council is an umbrella group of local and regional councils in Judea and Samaria. 'As for your enemies, who are also the enemies of America, we know that they seek to weaken you and to weaken us. And then to destroy you. And then to destroy us,' continued Cruz. He expressed sympathy for the 'unfathomable trauma' Israel and the Jewish people endure as 'Palestinian savages make the return of every hostage, living or murdered, an ongoing nightmare.' Cruz quoted remarks by Menachem Begin, part of a famous exchange the former Israeli prime minister had with then-Senator Joe Biden in June 1982. Biden reportedly banged on the table with his fist, to which Begin replied, 'This desk is designed for writing, not for fists. Don’t threaten us with slashing aid.' Quoting Begin, Cruz said: 'Don’t threaten us with cutting off your aid. It will not work. I am not a Jew with trembling knees. I am a proud Jew with 3,700 years of civilized history. Nobody came to our aid when we were dying in the gas chambers and ovens. Nobody came to our aid when we were striving to create our country. 'We paid for it. We fought for it. We died for it. We will stand by our principles. We will defend them. And when necessary, we will die for them again. With or without your aid.' The Texas senator concluded: 'Every person in this room has paid for the Land of Israel, has fought for the Land of Israel, and far too many have died for the Land of Israel. I am proud to stand with you unshakably as you determine the future of Judea and Samaria.'

Trump to sell US citizenship with $5 million ‘gold cards’	President Donald Trump announces plans to sell green cards to wealthy foreigners - dubbing them 'gold cards' - allowing holders to live and work in the US, with a pathway to citizenship. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration is drafting plans to sell residency and work permits to wealthy foreigners, along with a pathway to citizenship, President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday. Speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, the president unveiled a plan to sell visas - dubbed 'gold cards,' to non-citizens who can cough up the proposed $5 million fee. The new gold cards, which mirror green cards, will grant non-citizens residency and work rights on American territory, with an option to gain American citizenship. Currently, green cards are offered to non-citizens on the basis of family ties, pre-existing employment in the U.S., or through investment, via the EB-5 visa. The gold card system is expected to go into effect in two weeks, replacing the EB-5 investors green card visa. First launched in 1992, the EB-5 visas require a non-citizen to invest between $800,000 to $1.05 million in the U.S. 'We’re going to be selling a gold card,' Trump said. 'You have a green card. This is a gold card. We’re going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million and that’s going to give you green card privileges, plus it’s going to be a route to citizenship.' 'And wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card.' Trump touted the plan as a way to generate revenue without taxing American citizens, while also attracting high-income individuals to relocate to the U.S. When asked whether Russian oligarchs could take advantage of the opportunity, the president responded: 'Yeah, possibly. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people.' Standing alongside Trump in the Oval Office, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said applications for the gold card program would undergo a careful screening process. 'They’ll have to go through vetting, of course,' Lutnick said, 'to make sure they’re wonderful world-class global citizens.'

Tens of thousands mourn Bibas family as mother, children laid to ...	Crowds hold orange balloons, Israeli flags, and signs saying 'Sorry', sing Hatikva, as the funeral procession left its starting point in Rishon Lezion. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Tens of thousands of Israelis lined the route being taken Wednesday morning to bring to rest the Bibas family members murdered by Hamas, with the funeral procession making its way from central Israel to the cemetery near their Gaza-border home, Kibbutz Nir Oz. The family, who had stated earlier in the week that the funeral itself would be private, had published the approximate times the coffin-laden cars carrying Shiri Bibas and her two sons, Kfir (9 months) and Ariel (4) would pass various intersections in the country. The procession began around 8 AM at the religious burial society of Rishon Lezion, and thousands stood in the cold to honor the family. They held orange balloons, referring to the color of the young children’s hair, orange and Israeli flags, and many signs, among them those saying 'Sorry.' The apology was for the inability to save the three, whose picture, of an obviously terrified Shiri clutching her babies as terrorists surrounded her, became one of the most famous depictions of Hamas’ brutality on October 7, 2023, when the terrorists took 251 people hostage in all, and slaughtered 1,200 during their surprise invasion of Israel. Some of the onlookers burst into tears as the vehicles bearing the bodies passed by, while others sang Hatikva, Israel’s national anthem. In a statement to the masses of people paying their respects, the Bibas family said, 'We see and hear you; we are moved and strengthened by you.' 'Yarden apologizes for not being able to come and hug each and every one of you,' it continued. 'We hope for the day when we can once again be together in moments of joy and not sadness.' Yarden Bibas, Shiri’s husband and the children’s father, had been abducted separately and never saw his family in captivity. After the terrorists murdered them about a month into the war, they cruelly told him that an IDF airstrike had killed them, but provided no proof of their deaths, psychologically torturing him in addition to subjecting him to starvation and other harsh physical conditions until he was released on February 1. When the bodies were returned last week, at first Hamas tried to pass off a Palestinian body as Shiri’s but their subterfuge was immediately discovered and they bowed to the pressure to return her two days later. Forensic investigators proved that the terrorists had strangled Kfir and Ariel, but tried to make it look like they had died from an Israeli jet’s missile by crushing their skulls afterwards. These were horrific details that became public knowledge after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described this abuse of the victims in two different forums this week as proof of Hamas’ evil. IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari had said after the bodies were identified Friday that the children had been murdered 'in cold blood' and with 'bare hands,' and that their captors had then 'committed horrific acts' to cover up their crime. According to Ofri Bibas, Yarden’s sister, the family had wanted the details mentioned by Netanyahu kept private, saying in response to the extra revelations, 'If I could say one thing to everyone on behalf of the Bibas family: Just shut up.' 'As someone who sat in the room with Hagari that day, I’ll write this: Yarden and the family approved, word for word, what the IDF spokesman said in the statement. Nothing more,' she said. According to journalist Yossi Melman, however, Yarden had approved the dissemination of this added information. The funeral ceremony and eulogies will be broadcast live in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv and online beginning at 11:30.

‘Up to Netanyahu’ how to handle Hamas, says Trump	It is not my decision, it is Netanyahu's decision,' says Trump as fragile Gaza ceasefire faces possible collapse. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump has given Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a free hand in dealing with the Hamas terror organization, amid fears the fragile ceasefire in the Gaza Strip may be on the brink of collapse. The president spoke with reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday regarding the hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, and the president's ultimatum to Hamas earlier this month demanding that all Israeli hostages be released in a single transfer. 'As you know, they [Hamas] weren't going to release any more hostages, and I said there is going to be hell to pay, and then they agreed that they were going to release the hostages that they had agreed to release, plus an extra one,' Trump said of the near collapse of the hostage deal two weeks ago. Following Hamas' threat not to comply with the agreement and to delay the release of Israeli hostages, Trump said that it is up to Israel to decide whether to resume its war against Hamas. 'And so you could say that was a big difference. But I said that from that point, it's up to Bibi Netanyahu and Israel.' 'I may have taken a different stance,' Trump hinted. 'But they did go back to releasing the hostages. But if you remember, they said they weren't going to release any. They totally ended it.' 'And then I said, 'Well, if they're not going to release any, there's going to be hell to pay'.' 'But the rest is really up to him. I may have done it differently than him. It's not my decision, it's his decision. But they did release all of those hostages.' Following Trump's ultimatum and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's threat to resume the war in Gaza if hostages were not returned as planned on February 15th, Hamas agreed to release Israeli captives in keeping with the hostage deal. Since then, however, the future of the ceasefire, and the prospects for the implementation of the second phase of the deal appear increasingly uncertain, after Hamas misidentified one of the bodies returned to Israel last week, delaying the return of the remains of Shiri Bibas. Israel castigated the terror group for parading Israeli hostages - both living and dead - before their return to Israel, including one instance in which a captive was forced to kiss his captor goodbye. In response to the use of Israeli hostages in Hamas victory parades and ceremonies, Israel has frozen the freeing of 602 jailed Arab terrorists until Jerusalem receives assurances that no more Israeli captives will be used for public displays by Hamas.

Trump pressured Netanyahu to vote with Russia, against Ukraine in...	US reportedly 'insisted' Israel vote against resolution in the United Nations General Assembly affirming Ukraine's territorial integrity, joining Russia and North Korea in opposing the measure. By World Israel News Staff Israel voted this week against a United Nations resolution backing Ukraine's territorial integrity, amid pressure from the United States to actively oppose the measure, an Israeli official claimed. The vote, which was held in the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, marks the first time since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022 that Israel's mission to the UN has voted against Ukraine and backed the Russian position. Monday's resolution is symbolic, condemning Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine and demanding Russia withdraw all of its forces from Ukrainian territory, including Russian-majority provinces in eastern Ukraine annexed to Russia. The resolution passed by a wide majority of 93 to 18, with 65 abstentions. The United States joined Russia in opposing the resolution, along with North Korea, Belarus, Hungary, and Israel. Iran, China, and the United Arab Emirates all abstained. Speaking with the Jewish Insider in a report published Tuesday, an unnamed Israeli official emphasized that while Israel supports Ukraine's position, Jerusalem was subjected to intense pressure from Washington to vote against Monday's measure. 'There was a lot of pressure from the U.S., they really insisted,' the official said. 'It came at all levels, at the U.N., in Washington and in Israel.' The official emphasized that the vote 'is not our position.' It 'wasn’t easy for us … We preferred to avoid this situation. We had no choice but to take a side.' While Israel 'could have abstained,' the official continued, 'because we asked for a lot from [the Trump administration] in recent weeks and days, the decision was to go all the way with them.' The UN resolution L.10, identical to another measure passed with 141 votes in February 2023, was introduced to the General Assembly by Ukraine's deputy foreign affairs minister. The American mission to the UN, which voted in favor of the Ukrainian draft two years ago, submitted a rival resolution which was rejected by the General Assembly. The U.S.-backed draft resolution, L.11, emphasized the need for a 'swift end to the conflict' and a 'lasting peace between Ukraine and the Russian Federation,' without demanding a Russian withdrawal or condemning Russia's invasion. Ukraine slammed Israel's decision to vote against the Ukrainian-backed draft resolution. 'The resolution was blaming Russia for the war and supporting Ukrainian territorial integrity. Israel could have abstained, and it voted against it … It would be like if Ukraine would vote against returning the hostages to Israel,' Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel Yevgen Kornichuk told the Jewish Insider. 'This is really harming our relations.' However, Ukraine has regularly voted against Israel in the UN General Assembly, while never voting with the Jewish state on Israel-related measures. According to the group UN Watch, over the past ten years, Ukraine has voted against Israel on 75% of all measures related to the Jewish state, and abstained 25% of the time. Last year, Ukraine voted in favor of such anti-Israel measures as a resolution negating Israel's right to self-defense against Palestinian terror and endorsing Arab sovereignty over Gaza, Judea, Samaria, and eastern Jerusalem. Another measure passed last year and backed by Ukraine condemned Israeli towns in Judea, Samaria, the Golan Heights and Israeli neighborhoods in eastern Jerusalem.

Arab-Israeli soccer team fires spokesman for pro-Hamas interview	Spokesman of popular Arab-Israeli soccer team claims that women kidnapped by Hamas 'were treated with respect according to Islamic law and were not harmed.' By World Israel News Staff An Arab-Israeli who serves as the spokesman for the Bnei Sakhnin soccer team supported Hamas in an interview with an Arabic-language TV channel affiliated with the terror group, sparking outrage throughout Israel's soccer world. Said Hassanin, who is also a journalist, recently gave an interview to the Hamas-controlled Al-Aqsa TV channel, which is banned from broadcasting in Israel. During the interview, Hassanin downplayed Hamas atrocities against Israelis, and claimed that Israeli hostages had been treated humanely by their captors. He added that all women who were kidnapped by Hamas 'were treated with respect according to Islamic law and were not harmed. This clearly demonstrates who is barbaric and who is humane, and who is acting in accordance with their religious and Islamic teachings.' Hassanin failed to acknowledge widespread reports of sexual assault and harassment from freed female captives. Railing against Israeli-Arabs who enlist in the IDF, Hassanin referred to them as 'weak-minded people who join the ranks of the enemy army.' He added that 'the time has come for anyone [Arab] who is&#8230;considering joining the army of occupation to think a million times about where they are going and how they are selling their conscience, morality and religion on this immoral path.' Hassanin's remarks were met with swift pushback, as the Bnei Sakhnin soccer club announced that he had been fired. However, the club said they had 'summoned' Hassanin for clarification, and claimed that his remarks had been 'taken out of context.' Sports and Culture Minister Miki Zohar had encouraged Hassanin's firing, saying his continued employment would be a 'spit in the face' to Israeli soccer. 'Bnei Sakhnin cannot allow such things from [their club], otherwise we will not be able to heal the rifts in Israeli society. Despicable cases of this kind dramatically harm the shared life of Israelis and Arabs in the country and destroy solidarity in Israeli soccer,' he added. The Government Press Office (GPO) announced that it had rescinded Hassanin's press pass.

Israeli outlet blames Ben-Gvir for Hamas abusing hostages	Channel 13 publishes report claiming that Ben-Gvir's remarks on conditions of Palestinian prisoners led to worse treatment for Gaza captives; former minister fires back. By World Israel News Staff Channel 13 News blamed statements made by former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir for the abuses that Hamas hostages endured in captivity, triggering the Otzma Yehudit lawmaker to fire back. The outlet claimed in a report on Tuesday that a recently released hostage said that Hamas had 'worsened' the captives' conditions due to comments made by Ben-Gvir about crackdowns on Palestinian terrorists in Israel prison. The report did not reference the specific remarks made by Ben-Gvir, nor did it reveal which hostage had allegedly made the claim. Shortly after the October 7th attack, Ben-Gvir announced that privileges previously granted to imprisoned terrorists - such as access to entertainment and to a kitchen to make their own food - had been rescinded. Ben-Gvir also implemented changes to the prisoners' diets, removing treats from the menu. Some on the Israeli left decried the moves, claiming that keeping terrorists in stricter conditions would radicalize them further. 'Tonight, Channel 13 News decided to grant legitimacy to the atrocities committed by Hamas against the hostages, with a report claiming that due to the changes I led in the conditions of terrorists in prison, Hamas abused our hostages,' Ben-Gvir said in a media statement. They seem to have forgotten that the terrorists murdered, raped, and massacred Jews long before the reform in the terrorists' prison conditions was implemented. They don’t need any excuse to do this beyond our very existence,' he added. Ben-Gvir stressed that Israel's massive failures on October 7th stemmed from the belief that 'if we just tolerate, submit to the terrorists, and bow our heads, they will graciously agree to stop murdering Jews. We all saw the price of this distorted perception in the horrific massacre.' In a separate report, former hostage Eliya Cohen said that after the successful rescue of four Israeli hostages in June 2024, guards chained him and other captives together for days on end, with the idea that it would make rescuing them more difficult.

EU lawmaker who called Israel ‘terror state’ deported at airport	European Union MP Rima Hassan, who called October 7th terror onslaught 'legitimate,' posts angry tirade on X after being deported from Israel. By World Israel News Staff An anti-Israel European Union lawmaker was denied entry to Israel at Ben-Gurion Airport on Tuesday, with Israeli officials confirming she was deported due to her support for the Hamas terror group. Under Israeli law, foreign nationals who advocate against the State of Israel, including supporting BDS, praising terror groups, or otherwise making statements indicating a fundamental hostility towards Israel, may be denied entry to the country. Syria-born French EU parliament member Rima Hassan posted an angry tirade on social media after she was forced to return to Brussels, Belgium, from where she had departed. Hassan was set to visit Israel as part of a European Union delegation to the region. According to a Times of Israel report, another three members of the EU delegation were also banned from entering. 'The pro-Israel trolls lie just as much as the genocidal state they defend,' Hassan wrote on her X account. 'Israel’s self-centeredness is as infuriating as its propaganda. Passing through its airport was a necessity but our mission was solely in Palestinian territories. It’s time for the EU to act. It’s common for Israel to block parliamentary missions. It has barred UN experts, international NGOs and even the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor.' Notably, Hassan could have chosen to visit PA-controlled territory in Judea and Samaria by flying to Amman Airport in Jordan, rather than transiting through Israel. Hassan has a long history of agitating against Israel, referring to the country as a 'terrorist' state, demanding that Jewish residents of Israel 'leave Palestine,' and claiming that the IDF intentionally 'executes' Palestinian children. She is currently the defendant in an ongoing criminal case in France, due to saying that Hamas' October 7th attack on Israel was 'legitimate.' She has since claimed her remarks were misconstrued. 'Given Hassan’s antisemitic views and support for Hamas, her complaints about Israel only highlight her audacity and reinforce her status as a hostile figure,' Foreign Ministry Director-General Eden Bar-Tal said in a media statement. The Foreign Ministry denied a claim by Hassan that she had previously been approved by a visa, saying they had no knowledge of the matter but would investigate.

Israel finalizes swap with Hamas: 602 terrorist prisoners for 4 d...	There were reports of Hamas agreeing not to hold cruel propaganda ceremonies during the release of the four slain hostages. By World Israel News staff Hamas has announced that it has reached an agreement with Israel for the 'simultaneous' exchange of four Israeli hostages’ bodies and 602 Palestinian security prisoners. This deal resolves a deadlock that had threatened to derail the ceasefire agreement before its first phase could be completed. 'An agreement was reached to resolve the issue of the delayed release of Palestinian prisoners who were supposed to be freed in the last batch,' Hamas said. 'They will be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli prisoners agreed upon for transfer during the first phase, in addition to an equivalent number of Palestinian women and children.' An Israeli official confirmed the agreement. Another source familiar with the matter indicated that Egypt would oversee the exchange. Israel's decision to delay the prisoner release came after Hamas transferred the remains of an unidentified woman on Friday, claiming it was Shiri Bibas. This led to further scrutiny of Hamas’s handling of the deal. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office cited repeated violations of the ceasefire-hostage agreement as the reason for the postponement, stating that the release would be delayed until more Israeli hostages were secured. Israel had originally been scheduled to release the Palestinian prisoners on Saturday but refused to do so, citing Hamas’s violations of the agreement during the return of the Bibas family’s remains and the propaganda events it has conducted throughout the hostage release process in phase one. Earlier today, there were reports of Hamas agreeing not to hold cruel propaganda ceremonies during the release of the four slain hostages. However, similar commitments were made before the handover of the Bibas family members and the body of Oded Lifshitz but were not honored. As a result, Israel had refused to release the Palestinian prisoners before the Israeli hostages were returned. Hamas claimeed the agreement was finalized during meetings in Cairo between its delegation, led by Khalil al-Hayya, and Egyptian officials.

Edan Alexander is expected to be released in 'phase two' of the hostage agreement, though his mother Yael emphasized that she doesn't view the releases in terms of phases. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Yael Alexander, mother of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, credits U.S. President Donald Trump for the release of hostages and states that he knows 'exactly how to get this deal done.' Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage, was raised in the United States and chose to join the IDF rather than attend college. While serving in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion, he was captured by Hamas shortly after a phone conversation with his mother, Yael, during the October 7th attack. Edan Alexander is expected to be released in 'phase two' of the hostage agreement, though his mother emphasized that she doesn't view the releases as simply 'phase one' and 'phase two.' Yael Alexander explained, 'Now, we don’t see it as a phase. We view it as the way to bring our son home. What it’s called doesn’t matter. What matters is that there’s an agreement to bring the remaining hostages home as soon as possible.' She added, 'Time is not on the side of the hostages. That’s why we are so grateful for President Trump’s leadership.' Yael said that from the start, Trump knew 'exactly how to get this deal done.' She praised Trump's leadership, saying it 'has truly changed the situation.' 'We are closer to bringing them home than we’ve been at any point in the last 508 days,' Yael said. '508 days of darkness and uncertainty is too long. It’s time to end it.' In November, Hamas released a video featuring Alexander. His father, Adi, described the video as 'very emotional' and 'disturbing,' though it did provide confirmation that his son was still alive. The recent hostage release deal began on January 19th, just a day before Trump’s inauguration. During the event, Trump took credit for the agreement reached between Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization. The president also hailed the deal as signaling a major shift in the Middle East. 'This week, we achieved an epic ceasefire agreement as a first step toward lasting peace in the Middle East — an agreement that could only have happened as a result of our historic victory in November,' Trump stated.

Berlin chief rabbi welcomes new conservative chancellor Merz	Mr. Merz is a close personal friend and a steadfast ally of Israel,' Rabbi Teichtal said. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News News of conservative Friedrich Merz's electoral victory as the new German Chancellor was met with positive reactions from many Jews in Germany, including Berlin's Chief Rabbi, Yehuda Teichtal. Rabbi Teichtal sent a personal letter to Merz, thanking him for his support of Germany’s Jewish community and his commitment to addressing rising antisemitism. 'Mr. Merz is a close personal friend and a steadfast ally of Israel,' Rabbi Teichtal said. 'Over the years, he has welcomed us many times to discuss ways to strengthen Jewish life in Berlin. It has always been more than just a warm reception.' The letter also emphasized Merz’s belief in Germany’s historical responsibility to support Israel and combat antisemitism. In 2024, Merz expressed support for resuming arms shipments to Israel. Every Chanukah, Merz ensures that a large menorah is displayed in front of his party's headquarters, the Christian Democratic Union. He also attends lighting ceremonies with Rabbi Teichtal. 'After the lighting, Merz told me how happy he was that the menorah stood at party headquarters, but he was even more pleased to see Jewish life in Germany thriving,' Teichtal recalled. 'Congratulations, Friedrich Merz, on your electoral victory. Your friendship with the Jewish people and unwavering support for Israel are invaluable. Your commitment to fighting antisemitism and ensuring a prosperous Jewish future in Germany is truly inspiring.' The European Jewish Congress also welcomed Merz’s victory and the success of his Christian Democratic Union party. However, they expressed concern over the strong performance of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party in the elections. AfD was founded as an anti-euro party in 2013, but it has since shifted to adopt anti-immigration and nationalist stances. The party has called for moving beyond what they describe as a 'cult of shame' regarding Nazi atrocities. This position was echoed by party figures such as Alexander Gauland, who controversially referred to the Nazi period as 'bird shit' in German history. Despite this, Merz has ruled out cooperation with the AfD, viewing the party as a threat to democracy. 'We have fundamentally different views, particularly on foreign policy, security policy, and many other issues, including Europe, the euro, and NATO,' Merz stated. 'You advocate for the opposite of what we believe in, so there will be no cooperation.'

Mossad chief explains how Hezbollah beeper operation was the ‘tur...	On September 17, 2024, thousands of pagers in the hands of Hezbollah terrorists detonated simultaneously, killing 30 people and injuring 4,000, most of whom were terrorists. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Tuesday, Mossad Director David Barnea discussed the origins of the beeper operation that targeted Hezbollah terrorists and how it became the 'turning point' of the Lebanon War. Barnea explained to the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) that the beeper operation was 'a clear example of the realization of our mission.' On September 17, 2024, thousands of pagers in the hands of Hezbollah terrorists detonated simultaneously, killing 30 people and injuring 4,000, most of whom were terrorists. The pagers, initially possessed by Hezbollah members, were remotely activated months later. The Mossad chief highlighted that the operation 'reflects a deep understanding of the enemy, intelligence mastery, technological superiority, and exceptional operational capabilities.' He further described the operation as a 'turning point' in the northern conflict, marking 'the beginning of the 10 days that shifted the balance in our favor. A clear distinction can be drawn in the northern campaign—from the exploding pagers to the elimination of Nasrallah and the subsequent ceasefire agreement.' Following the attack, Hezbollah's now-deceased leader Hassan Nasrallah acknowledged that Israel had delivered a 'major blow' to the terror organization. Nasrallah stated, 'We undoubtedly suffered a major security and humanitarian blow, unprecedented in the conflict, and perhaps in the history of mankind.' He added, 'We were hit hard, but that’s the nature of war. We understand that the enemy possesses technological supremacy.' The beeper operation followed a similar attempt using walkie-talkies developed ten years ago, which was found to be ineffective in many combat situations. Barnea noted, 'Therefore, we devised an alternative method to target Hezbollah terrorists—by detonating a device that was always attached to their bodies.' Although the operation could have been launched in the days or weeks following October 7, 2023, relatively few pagers had been distributed at that time compared to the larger number used in the operation. 'The preparatory infrastructure for the operation was established in late 2022, with the first shipment of 500 pagers arriving in Lebanon just weeks before the horrific massacre of October 7.' However, Barnea emphasized that launching the operation earlier would not have had the same powerful impact as it did later. By September 2024, Barnea explained, 'Ten times more beepers were detonated than at the start of the war, and twice as many radios were used.' 'The dilemma in launching the operation on September 17, 2024, was significant. In the discussion on whether to approve the operation, two schools of thought emerged, both of which were valid at the time.' He concluded, 'The prime minister ultimately made the decision, completely opposing the prevailing opinion in the discussion, and now we are witnessing the outcome.'

World’s oldest Holocaust survivor dies at 113	It’s pretty incredible. She’s always been so positive. She always says the secret to her longevity is she loves to eat dark chocolate,' granddaughter Gina Bennicasa tells LI Herald. By Jewish Breaking News Before her death at age 113, Rose Girone was not just a number in the record books. The world’s oldest Holocaust survivor carried a century of resilience within her and three secrets to longevity: dark chocolate, loving children, and waking each day with purpose. Born January 13, 1912, in Poland, Girone’s early years saw her family move throughout Europe. By 1938, she had married and settled in Breslau, Germany, just as Nazi persecution of the Jews intensified. The writing on the wall was clear by 1939. With options dwindling, the family fled to the only country still accepting Jewish refugees. After a month-long journey by boat, Girone arrived in Shanghai’s international settlement with her husband and young daughter Reha, briefly finding peace before war engulfed them again. As Japanese forces occupied Shanghai during World War II, the Jewish community was forced into a ghetto. Her family was confined to what had originally been a bathroom. Each day became an exercise in survival. Girone would buy water, bathe her daughter, wash clothes and then the floor of their living quarters all with the same bucket. Even in these desperate conditions, Girone’s resilience shone through. A skilled knitter, she started a small business within the ghetto to earn money for her family. When visas were finally arranged for passage to America in 1947, refugees were forbidden from taking more than $10 each. However, after having earned $80 through her knitting, Girone refused to leave her hard-earned money behind, so she cleverly weaved it into her sweater before arriving at Ellis Island. In New York, Girone reunited with family members who had escaped the Holocaust. Knitting remained the constant thread throughout Girone’s life. She worked in various shops before opening a knitting concession at the Sagamore Hotel in Lake George. Eventually, she saved enough to open a shop in Rego Park and another in Forest Hills, Queens. Even after retirement, her passion continued. She volunteered at libraries, teaching others the craft that had once saved her family from starvation. After a fall at 109, she moved to Belair Nursing and Rehabilitation Center on Long Island for rehabilitation where she became something of a celebrity among residents and staff. Although her body gradually failed her, Girone’s spirit for life never waned. 'It’s pretty incredible. She’s always been so positive. She always says the secret to her longevity is she loves to eat dark chocolate,' granddaughter Gina Bennicasa tells LI Herald. 'She has good children, and she has a purpose. She always said to me, ‘Always have a purpose in life. Get up, and always have a purpose.'' In Rose Girone’s 113 years, she found purpose in survival, in creation, in family, and ultimately in bearing witness to history. With her passing on Tuesday, we lost not just a remarkable Holocaust survivor, but a living connection to a world that sadly grows more distant with each passing day.

Sharabi was killed when the building they were in collapsed during an airstrike, while Svirsky was murdered days later. By Pesach Benson, TPS Former hostage Noa Argamani addressed the UN Security Council on Tuesday, the first captive of Hamas to do so. Hamas abducted Argamani, now 27, and her boyfriend, Avinatan Or, at the Nova Music Festival by Kibbutz Reim on October 7. She was eventually rescued in June 2024 along with Almog Meir, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv 'Until Avinatan returns – my heart is captive,' Argamani said as she sat beside Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon. Argamani told the Council it was urgent to secure the release of the remaining hostages as soon as possible. 'We don’t have any more time! I’m here today because it’s a miracle, but there are still 63 hostages living this nightmare. They are in complete darkness, not knowing whether they will live or die in the next moment. Every moment that passes is an eternity of suffering,' Argamani implored. 'We are talking about innocent people who were kidnapped from their beds, from a dance party, from their simple lives – and taken to a world of torture and humiliation. Hamas treated us like pawns in an evil game, driven by cruelty for its own sake,' she said. Argamani also recounted being held with Emily Hand and Hila Rotem, both young girls. Today at the UN security meeting, Noa Argamani told the council about the horrific deaths of Yossi Sharabi and Itay Svirsky. Every second in captivity, the hostages are at the mercy of Hamas. And we know what their mercy looks like. We must bring them home now! pic.twitter.com/8ICjqWBaON &mdash; Hen Mazzig (@HenMazzig) February 25, 2025 'At the time, Emily was eight years old and Hila was 12. I saw the fear in their eyes, the trembling in their bodies. I had to be strong for them, to hide the horrors so that they could survive another day. I told them to ignore all the bombings, all the shooting and everything around,' Argamani recalled. 'They were released in the first deal, and I was left behind. I can’t even begin to explain the feeling of being left behind – but I know that’s exactly what the hostages are feeling right now. Abandoned by the world,' she said. Argamani also recalled being with Yossi Sharabi and Itay Svirsky when they died. Sharabi was killed when the building they were in collapsed during an airstrike, while Svirsky was murdered days later. 'One evening, the house where we were being held was bombed, and we found ourselves buried under the rubble. Itay managed to get up, but Yossi and I were trapped under the piles of concrete. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. I was sucked into the darkness and thought that this was it, these were the last seconds of my life. I screamed with all my might for someone to hear me, and I also heard Yossi’s screams. Screams of pain, of pleas, of a man trapped between life and death. Then, after a few seconds, I heard only silence. Yossi died next to me, alone, helpless,' she recalled. 'Two days after we moved to another house, Itay was brutally murdered by one of our captors. He was with me from the first day of captivity. We talked about our families, about the life we ​​left behind. He was a pure soul. And now he is gone. The international community must understand: our captors are living in hell on earth. They have no time! They have no hope without action.' Soldiers recovered Svirsky’s remains in December. She added, 'What kept me alive in captivity until now is something my mother always told me: ‘Always be good, always hold on to the light.’ So here, in this forum, I will end with these words: Be good. But more than that, be right. Act now. Bring them – all of them – home.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 63 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

‘We are still not seen’: Displaced Israelis struggle as reconstru...	The report also found that as of February 2025, many temporary housing projects remained incomplete, leaving displaced residents in unstable living conditions. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Bureaucratic delays, political disputes, and housing shortages have stalled reconstruction in Gaza-area communities, leaving many displaced Israeli residents in limbo despite promises of swift rehabilitation and essential funding, Israel’s State Comptroller said in a biting report released on Monday. Tens of thousands of residents of southern communities were forced to evacuate after Hamas’s October 7 attack. 'The findings reveal failures in government preparedness, temporary housing solutions, and long-term reconstruction. It is inconceivable that political disagreements and bureaucratic obstacles prevent the allocation of a NIS 5 billion [$1.4 billion] development budget,' said State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman. The comptroller, also known as the state ombudsman, periodically releases reports auditing Israeli preparedness and the effectiveness of government policies. In the aftermath of October 7, the government established the Tekuma Directorate to oversee reconstruction of homes and infrastructure. But the comptroller’s investigation revealed significant obstacles in implementing these initiatives. According to Englman’s report, government agencies failed to establish a comprehensive emergency housing strategy. Delays in defining the geographical scope of the affected region created legal and financial barriers, to allocating Tekuma’s NIS 5 billion ($1.4 billion) budget. The report also found that as of February 2025, many temporary housing projects remained incomplete, leaving displaced residents in unstable living conditions. The report highlights specific cases where makeshift homes lacked essential infrastructure, posing safety hazards and prolonging the suffering of evacuees. Sharon Segev, a resident of Kibbutz Be’eri told The Press Service of Israel, 'There is a feeling that something new is starting, a great expectation that things will improve, but within all of this, there is also a sense that we are still not truly seen.' Kibbutz Be’eri was one of the hardest-hit Gaza-border communities during Hamas’s October 7 attack. More than 100 terrorists infiltrated the kibbutz that day, killing more than 100 residents and abducting over 30. Many homes were burnt during the fighting. Since then, around 1,000 residents of the kibbutz spent months at a hotel by the Dead Sea before most relocated to Kibbutz Hatzerim in August. 'We were invisible during the long hours we were locked in our safe rooms on October 7, and even now, from the state’s perspective, it seems as if we are taken care of—placed in hotels, with temporary housing being built in Hatzerim,' Segev said. Further compounding the situation, a leadership vacuum in the Tekuma Directorate has exacerbated operational inefficiencies. According to the report, Tekuma, which was established in October 2023 has lacked a permanent director, and that temporary appointments have hindered decision making and coordination among various government ministries. Residents of the hardest-hit communities told the State Comptroller that the absence of clear leadership has directly affected the speed and quality of reconstruction efforts. The report also criticizes the government’s failure to expedite legislative measures necessary for funding and development. Despite a strategic rehabilitation plan being approved in December 2023, political disputes delayed its implementation. The report warned that without urgent intervention from the Prime Minister, critical projects may remain stalled, jeopardizing their long-term viability. Meanwhile, a separate report released last week by the Tekuma Directorate, marking 500 days since the war, provided an official update on reconstruction progress. According to the report, Tekuma’s five-year budget amounts to NIS 19 billion ($5.3 billion), with NIS 7 billion ($1.96 billion) already allocated throughout 2024. Efforts have focused on infrastructure, security, and rebuilding public facilities. Of the approximately 64,000 residents initially displaced, 83% have returned to their homes, with 92% of those who face no security or rehabilitation obstacles already back. However, 13 communities still face restrictions preventing a full return, Tekuma reported. To support those unable to return, hundreds of temporary housing units have been established, with 99% of the necessary interim solutions provided within the first year. Large-scale reconstruction work is ongoing in heavily affected communities such as Ein HaShlosha, Keren Shalom, Nahal Oz, Nirim, and Re’im. In some cases, the rebuilding efforts are progressing ahead of schedule, while others — such as Kibbutz Nir Oz — still await full rehabilitation plans. The restoration of homes in Re’im is expected to conclude by the end of March 2025, with Nirim following by the end of April. 'The residents of the Gaza border communities and western Negev have endured one of the most severe disasters in Israel’s history. Their rehabilitation and the development of their communities must be a top priority for the Israeli government,' said Englman. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 63 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

Israel’s top diplomat urges Lebanese people to break free from ‘I...	Lebanon has grown tired of the wars of others on its land,' Lebanese president Joseph Aoun told the Iranian officials. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar has called on the Lebanese people to break free from 'the Iranian occupation,' pushing Israel’s northern neighbor to weaken the political and military influence of the Iran-backed terrorist organization Hezbollah. 'The images from Nasrallah’s ‘funeral’ now precisely reflect the historic crossroads where Lebanon stands: The continuation of the Iranian occupation in Lebanon, through Hezbollah — or liberation from Iran and Hezbollah and freedom to Lebanon,' Sa’ar wrote in a post on X, referring to long-time Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli military strike in September. His funeral was held in Lebanon on Sunday. 'The choice is in the hands of Lebanon and the Lebanese people,' Sa’ar added. The Israeli diplomat’s comments came as Lebanese President Joseph Aoun told a visiting Iranian delegation on Sunday that the country was 'tired' of external conflicts playing out on its territory, asserting that Lebanon is not a battleground for others and hinting at a possible break from Iranian influence. 'Lebanon has grown tired of the wars of others on its land,' Aoun told the Iranian officials, according to a statement released by the newly appointed president’s office. 'Countries should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.' The images from Nasrallah’s 'funeral' now precisely reflect the historic crossroads where Lebanon stands:The continuation of the Iranian occupation in Lebanon, through Hezbollah - or liberation from Iran and Hezbollah and freedom to Lebanon.The choice is in the hands of… pic.twitter.com/6aDBZCsfYV &mdash; Gideon Sa'ar | גדעון סער (@gidonsaar) February 23, 2025 Iranian officials met Aoun during their visit to Beirut for the funeral of Nasrallah, former leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah, which fought a year-long conflict with Israel in parallel with the Gaza war that ended in a November ceasefire. Nearly five months after his death in an Israeli airstrike, Hezbollah buried Nasrallah in a mass funeral meant to showcase political strength despite the group’s weakened state following the war. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) killed Nasrallah on Sept. 27 last year in an airstrike as he met commanders in a bunker in Beirut’s southern suburbs, delivering a major setback to the Islamist group amid an Israeli offensive. The campaign went on to decimate much of Hezbollah’s leadership and military capabilities through air and ground attacks. Hezbollah’s losses from the war with Israel were further compounded by the fall of its ally, Bashar al-Assad, in Syria, which had long served as a vital supply route for Iranian weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon under Assad’s rule. During Sunday’s high-level meeting, Aoun said Lebanon wanted 'the best relations with Tehran, for the benefit of both countries and people.' According to Aoun’s statement, Iran’s parliamentary speaker Mohammed Bagher Ghalibaf extended President Masoud Pezeshkian’s invitation for Aoun to visit Iran. In a televised address at Nasrallah’s funeral in a Beirut stadium, current Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem declared his refusal to let 'tyrant America' control Lebanon. The United States helped broker the Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire after almost a year of fighting. The conflict, which Hezbollah launched in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas during the early days of the Gaza war in October 2023, resulted in thousands of deaths in Lebanon and widespread destruction across the country’s south. Under the ceasefire agreement, Israel was given 60 days to withdraw from southern Lebanon, allowing the Lebanese army and UN forces to take over security as Hezbollah disarms and moves away from Israel’s northern border. Though Israel has largely withdrawn from the south, its troops continue to hold five hilltop positions in the area, as Israeli leaders seek to reassure northern residents that they can return home safely. Tens of thousands of residents in northern Israel were forced to evacuate their homes last year and in late 2023 amid unrelenting attacks from Hezbollah, which expressed solidarity with Hamas amid the Gaza war. The meeting between Iranian officials and Aoun took place even though regular flights between the two countries had been suspended. On Feb. 13, Lebanon banned flights to and from Iran after Israel accused Tehran of using civilian planes to smuggle cash to Beirut to Hezbollah and warned of possible military action against such flights. In response, Iran barred Lebanese planes from repatriating dozens of Lebanese nationals stranded in the country, stating it would not allow Lebanese flights to land until its own flights could resume in Beirut.

Tehran fears US-Israeli strikes could put its ‘existence in dange...	In related news, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Tuesday dismissed the possibility of direct nuclear talks with the United States. By JNS Iran has put defense systems around its nuclear sites on high alert amid fears of a joint U.S.-Israeli attack, The Telegraph reported on Tuesday, citing two 'high-level government sources' in Tehran. The Islamic Republic is 'just waiting for the attack and are anticipating it every night and everything has been on high alert—even in sites that no one knows about,' one of the sources told the U.K.-based newspaper. Work to fortify Tehran’s nuclear sites 'has intensified over the past year, particularly since Israel launched the first attack' on the Iranian military in response to Iran’s April 13, 2024, missile and drone assault on the Jewish state, he added. The Iranian official who spoke to The Telegraph said there are currently fears in regime circles that 'the U.S. could join in and launch a larger-scale attack that could put the Islamic Republic’s existence in danger.' Remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump about potential plans to strike Iran have further intensified these activities, the source noted. The official acknowledged that further Israeli military action could leave Iran vulnerable, as the country’s air defense systems had been 'heavily weakened' by Jerusalem’s unprecedented Oct. 26 retaliatory airstrikes. 'Several additional [air defense system] launchers have been deployed, but there is an understanding that they may not be effective in the event of a large-scale strike,' according to the official cited by the newspaper. In related news, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Tuesday dismissed the possibility of direct nuclear talks with the United States. 'There will be no possibility of direct talks between us and the United States on the nuclear issue as long as the maximum pressure is applied in this way,' Araghchi said, referring to recent sanctions on Tehran. Last week, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) renewed its threats to launch a third direct missile and drone assault against Israel. 'True Promise III will be carried out at the appropriate time,' Brig. Gen. Ali Fadavi, the IRGC’s second in command, said in comments published by the Islamic Republic’s semi-official Mehr News Agency. Last year, the Islamic Republic conducted two major attacks against Israel, launching nearly 500 missiles and drones at the Jewish state. The assaults, which were largely ineffective thanks to Israeli and allied defense measures that intercepted the vast majority of the projectiles, including guided ballistic missiles, were codenamed 'True Promise I' (on the night of April 13-14) and 'True Promise II' (on Oct. 1) by Iran. Araghchi said in November that Tehran reserves the right to take action against Israel 'at an appropriate time and in a way we think is right.' He made it clear that Iran considers Israel’s October retaliatory strike, that took out most of the regime’s air defenses, as warranting a separate response. In a separate Feb. 18 statement, Brig. Gen. Alireza Sabahifard, who heads Iran’s Air Defense Force, said Tehran was 'ready to deal with any threat because all the equipment we currently have is 100% indigenous.' Sabahifard claimed that the Iranian-produced Bavar 373 air-defense battery 'cannot be compared to any defense system in the world.'

ICC blasts Germany’s next chancellor for inviting Netanyahu	After chairman of Germany's conservative Christian Democrats invited Israeli Prime Minister to visit, International Criminal Court slams pledge to ensure premier will not face prosecution while in Europe. By World Israel News Staff The leader of Germany's largest political party and the candidate most likely to replace outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz came under fire this week, after he invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit Germany. On Sunday, an alliance of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) won a combined 208 seats in the 630-member German parliament, defeating the center-left SPD, which plummeted to third place, behind the rightist Alternative for Deutschland (AfD). The election has positioned CDU/CSU chairman Friedrich Merz as the natural candidate for the chancellorship, though he will face tough coalition talks to secure a majority, so long as he adheres to his pledge not to form a government with the AfD. Hours after his victory, Merz spoke by phone with Netanyahu, who congratulated him on his victory and on becoming chancellor-designate. During their talk, Merz invited Netanyahu to visit Germany, pledging to ensure that the Israeli premier would not face prosecution under the International Criminal Court arrest warrant, issued last year for Netanyahu's involvement in the war against Hamas. 'Chancellor-designate Merz thanked the Prime Minister for the conversation and said that he would invite him to make an official visit to Germany, in overt defiance of the scandalous International Criminal Court decision to label the Prime Minister a war criminal,' the Prime Minister's Office said on Sunday. A day later, Merz confirmed to reporters that he had indeed invited Netanyahu to visit Germany in defiance of the ICC arrest warrant. 'I think it is a completely absurd idea that an Israeli prime minister cannot visit the Federal Republic of Germany,' Merz said. His government, Merz continued, 'would find ways and means for him to visit Germany and leave again without being arrested.' The ICC responded by rejecting the right of individual ICC member states to refuse enforcement of court orders. 'It is not for states to unilaterally determine the soundness of the court’s legal decisions.'

Elon Musk slams Netanyahu trial – ‘Deep state is everywhere’	Billionaire tech mogul and Trump administration efficiency czar Elon Musk takes aim at the Netanyahu corruption trial, defending the Israeli premier while accusing prosecutors of acting as part of the 'deep state.' By World Israel News Staff Billionaire tech mogul and administrator of the federal Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk defended Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday, criticizing the ongoing corruption trial of the prime minister. On Monday night, Musk retweeted a link to a YouTube clip of a two-year-old documentary on the ongoing criminal trial against the prime minister, which combines three separate accusations, spanning Cases 1000, 2000, and 4000. The clip was tweeted last week by Fox News host and conservative pundit Mark Levin, who captioned the link 'The legal war against Netanyahu.' Musk retweeted the link, adding in 'The deep state is everywhere.' The Netanyahu trial, which includes charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust over the prime minister's alleged efforts to speed up already approved regulatory changes in exchange for favorable coverage by the Walla news site, plans to curtail the free distribution of a newspaper in exchange for positive coverage by a rival paper, and help offered to businessmen in exchange for large gifts, was kicked off following the November 21st, 2019 indictment of Netanyahu. While the trial began in May 2020, it has been repeatedly delayed due to the COVID pandemic, Israel's political crisis from 2019 to 2022, and the war in Gaza. Critics have accused prosecutors of attempting a putsch, arguing that there is no legal precedent for considering desirable coverage bribery, and dismissing claims of positive coverage by either outlet cited in the corruption investigations. Musk, who met with Netanyahu earlier this month, was defended by Netanyahu from accusations of antisemitism in January, after some interpreted his hand gesture at a Trump inauguration event as a Nazi salute. 'Elon Musk is being falsely smeared,' Netanyahu tweeted. 'Elon is a great friend of Israel. He visited Israel after the October 7 massacre in which Hamas terrorists committed the worst atrocity against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.' 'He has since repeatedly and forcefully supported Israel’s right to defend itself against genocidal terrorists and regimes who seek to annihilate the one and only Jewish state.'

Hamas using ceasefire period to rearm and rebuild – report	The Gazan terrorist group, far from deterred, is already preparing for another round of fighting, says military reporter. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Far from being deterred, Hamas is using the current ceasefire period to rearm and rebuild so it can attack Israel again, Yediot Ahronot reported Tuesday. Thousands of terrorists have returned to central and northern Gaza, where they had been hiding in refugee camps and preserving their weapons on orders from their top command 'once they realized Hezbollah had abandoned [Hamas],' wrote military reporter Yoav Zitun. The Lebanese Iranian proxy did not try a mass invasion of Israel after the Hamas massacres of October 7, 2023, contenting itself with showing support by firing over 10,000 missiles, rockets, and UAVs at northern Israel over the 15 months of war. The terrorists could move freely among the hundreds of thousands of civilians who started walking back to their hometowns right after the ceasefire began last month, since Israel quickly abandoned the Netzarim Corridor that had divided the Strip roughly in half. Only those going north by car are inspected by security contractors as to their identities and belongings. According to Zitun, these fighters found 'many hundreds of terrorists' who had never left Gaza City and its environs over the course of the war. Together, they have reconstituted themselves into new companies and battalions and staffed them with new commanders, he wrote. While the flow of arms from outside has been halted due to the IDF’s presence on all sides of the coastal enclave, especially on the Philadelphi Corridor at the Egyptian-Gazan border, the terror organization has found an 'inside' source, the report added. 'Hamas has gathered, over the last month, a large amount of explosives from the arsenal of the IDF after it retreated,' Zitun wrote, 'enabling it to booby-trap areas with bombs and create new weapons for its forces.' In January 2024, The New York Times reported that Israeli investigators had found that military-grade contents of Hamas rockets came from unexploded ordnance fired by the Israeli air force in earlier rounds of clashes in Gaza. According to Yediot Ahronot, the group is also repairing tunnels that the IDF damaged and preparing those that were not found, including for offensive purposes. The terrorists have also both set up stationary cameras and begun using drones for observation purposes in many central points in the Strip in an attempt to rebuild its intelligence capabilities. In addition, the report said, 'Hamas has managed to locate and re-aim not a few rocket launchers' that the IDF did not find and destroy during the war. Perhaps to send a message that it is still capable of doing so, they have fired four rockets towards Israel in the last week, although they did no damage, having been shot down or falling within the Strip. In another sign that it has not been deterred, Zitun noted, Hamas has renewed its civilian governance of the Strip, providing municipal services and collecting taxes from the distribution of food and fuel aid that Israel brings in, in order to pay its members’ salaries.' The IDF, he concluded, is finalizing its own preparations for another widespread land and air operation, knowing that while Hamas has been greatly damaged, 'there is still a lot of work to do to finish it off militarily.'

Trump expands sanctions on Iran under ‘maximum pressure campaign’	Oil sales to China, a major source of income, has dropped by more than half since January. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The U.S. government announced Tuesday that it is placing eight more companies on its blacklist as part of President Donald Trump’s 'maximum pressure campaign' against the Islamic Republic. The companies will be sanctioned for 'knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the sale or transport of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran,' the State Department said. The reason given is that 'Iran continues to destabilize global security with its nuclear threat, ballistic missile program, and support for terrorist groups,' and the sanctions’ purpose is 'to 'stem the flow of revenue the regime uses to fund these destabilizing activities.' The sanctions block the companies and their owners from their American properties, and from receiving funds, goods or services in the U.S. The move is in line with a National Security Presidential Memorandum Trump signed earlier this month 'to implement a campaign aimed at driving Iran’s oil exports to zero.' China is a huge buyer of these products, with a November report by the Congressional Research Service stating that 'nearly all' of Iran’s petroleum exports went in 2024 to the Asian giant. The Chinese have now drastically reduced their purchase of Iranian crude, according to an investigation by the opposition Iran International news service, thus dealing Tehran a heavy financial blow. Citing data by Kpler, a company that provides data and analytics for global trade, the London-based service reported that China’s imports 'fell by more than half in January,' even before the first new sanctions were ordered, compared to October 2024. China implemented its decision by forbidding sanctioned oil tankers from entering its Shandong port, where 90% of Iranian crude is offloaded, Iran International explained. It credited Beijing’s fear of potential sanctions by the incoming administration for the move. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has estimated that Iran’s oil companies earned about $53 billion for the state coffers from their exports in 2023. Others say its petroleum and petrochemical sales generated as much as $70 billion. Sanctioning more companies now for helping Tehran sell its oil will tighten screws that had begun to be applied last year by the Biden administration. After Iran’s first attempted direct attack on Israel with hundreds of missiles and drones in March, the U.S. put sanctions on ports, tankers, and refineries involved in the purchase of Iranian oil, and added dozens more vessels to the blacklist after Tehran tried a second wave in October.

GOP push to deport Ilhan Omar ignites Capitol chaos	Omar’s political resilience is particularly concerning given her history of opposition towards Israel and American support for its closest ally. By Jewish Breaking News Squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) hasn’t gained many friends in Congress due to her long time vocal support for Hamas and her radical views. Now, first-term Rep. Brandon Gill (R-TX) is circulating a petition demanding the Arab congresswoman’s deportation through a fundraising campaign titled 'Petition: Deport Ilhan Omar.' 'Friend, we should have never let Ilhan Omar into our country,' the fundraising email reads, as first reported by Axios. 'And frankly, America would be a much better place if she were to be sent back to Somalia.' Gill also accused Omar of 'facilitating a full-scale invasion of our country,' claiming that a 'normal society would refer to that as treason.' Omar quickly hit back at what she called an orchestrated attack on American democracy itself. 'Representative Gill’s attempt to clout chase by threatening to deport a legal US citizen because you disagree with them is directly out of Donald Trump’s fascist playbook,' she said. 'It is truly disgusting that members of the Republican party feel emboldened to engage in racist and quite frankly fascist remarks.' The petition comes after a video went viral last week showing Omar conducting seminars for undocumented Somali immigrants where she told them that they are 'not obligated' to answer questions from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 'The video is manipulated, and I wasn’t even at the event shown,' Omar clapped back on X, adding that 'every single person in this country deserves to know their rights. That’s legal.' Tech billionaire Elon Musk accused Omar of 'breaking the law,' while Democratic colleagues rushed to her defense. Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) called it 'disgusting that Republicans are attempting to raise money by threatening to deport a US citizen just because they disagree with her.' Meanwhile, Representative Mark Pocan (D-WI) demanded immediate action from House leadership. '@SpeakerJohnson, get control of your caucus before we have to take other actions,' he posted on X. 'This is demeaning & embarrassing. We all need to be better than this s***. I expect an answer today.' Omar’s political resilience is particularly concerning given her history of opposition towards Israel and American support for its closest ally. Despite being removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee last year for her inflammatory remarks, Omar’s constituents in Minnesota seem unfazed by her anti-Israel crusade, having easily won reelection for a third term in November with 56.2% of the vote.

Two suspects detained after crossing from Jordan into Israel; Gol...	In November, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered the construction of a security barrier along the entire border with Jordan to thwart terrorist infiltrations. By JNS Israeli security forces detained two people near the Dead Sea on Monday night who had illegally crossed from Jordan into Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The suspects, believed to be migrant workers, were handed over to authorities for questioning, according to Hebrew media. The incident comes amid increasing tensions along Israel’s eastern frontier with Jordan, which at almost 200 miles is the Jewish state’s longest border. Terrorist infiltrators from Jordan shot and wounded two Israelis near the Dead Sea in October. A month earlier, three security guards at the Allenby Bridge crossing in the Jordan Valley were murdered in a terrorist shooting. The gunman, who according to the IDF was a Jordanian citizen, was killed. He was later named as Maher D’yab Hussein Jazi, a 39-year-old truck driver from the city of Irbid. In November, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered the construction of a security barrier along the entire border with Jordan to thwart terrorist infiltrations. This followed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‘s pledge that Jerusalem would work with Amman to strengthen the eastern frontier to maintain 'peace and security' in the area. Drone incursions The Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Tuesday morning that alerts issued at 8:39 a.m. regarding a suspected hostile aircraft infiltration in the southern Golan Heights were a false alarm. The incident triggered sirens in several communities, and interceptors were launched toward two suspicious aerial targets. The incident has concluded and is under investigation, according to the IDF. No damage or casualties were reported.

Smotrich: Israel to seize land if Gaza hostages aren’t returned	Smotrich also warned that a resumption of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza would 'make more areas look like Jabaliya, and this will convince many Gazans to leave.' By Canaan Lindor, JNS Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Monday that if Hamas fails to return all of the hostages it is holding by Saturday, Israel will permanently seize land in the Gaza Strip. Speaking at the Sovereignty Conference 2025 in Jerusalem, the Religious Zionism Party head said that if the hostages, both the living and the dead, are not returned by then, 'Israel will expand the agricultural areas of the kibbutzim Be’eri and Nir Oz into the perimeter area of ​​the Gaza Strip.' Kibbutz agriculture, he continued, 'will expand at the expense of Gaza—and this land will remain in our hands forever.' This ultimatum was the most concrete action plan that came out of the conference, an annual event focused on making Judea, Samaria and Gaza inseparable parts of the State of Israel. This year’s conference was held at the Vert Hotel near Jerusalem’s International Convention Center, with some 200 people in attendance. During his address, Smotrich also said that Israel would return to fighting in Gaza, but did not indicate when. 'We are preparing, gaining capabilities, and when we feel we are ready, we will open the gates of hell on Hamas again. It requires patience, but in the end we will bring about the desired outcome,' he said. During a later Q&A with Channel 12 News journalist Amit Segal, Smotrich said that in a year from now, Gaza will be 'held by us, with fewer Gazans and more Israelis moving there. If we take out 10,000 Gazans a day—within four months the Strip will be empty. That would be the best solution—for us and for them.' The conference, which brought together prominent leaders and activists on the Israeli right, highlighted expectations for Israel’s government to change the status quo in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza with support from the U.S. administration. Smotrich is scheduled to visit the U.S. next week for talks with his American counterpart, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, according to a report by Ynet on Tuesday. Several speakers expressed a sense of urgency to leverage what they described as a promising but fleeting geopolitical constellation.

Co-produced by the Yesha Council of Judea and Samaria communities, the event has served for over two decades as a platform to advocate making Judea, Samaria and Gaza, or areas therein, part of Israel. Advocates of this move have called for applying Israeli civilian law in those areas, which are currently administered by the Israeli army or the Palestinians. About half a million Jews live in Judea and Samaria, alongside about 2 million Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority administers the major Palestinian population centers in the area. In Gaza, Hamas has been in power since 2007, having overthrown the P.A. Israel pulled out of the Gaza Strip in 2005, uprooting thousands of residents of Israeli communities established in Gush Katif since 1967. The Israel-Hamas war, sparked by the terror group’s Oct. 7, 2023 invasion and massacre, has given rise to hopes for a return by Jewish residents to the Gaza Strip. The current phase of the ceasefire in Gaza is set to expire on March 1, though there is a possibility it may be extended. Smotrich warned on Monday that a resumption of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza would 'make more areas look like Jabaliya, and this will convince many Gazans to leave.' According to an analysis of satellite imagery commissioned by Channel 12 and published earlier this month, 100% of Jabaliya’s 19,000 buildings were destroyed during the war. The overall figure for Gaza was 65%, according to the report. Knesset Member Dan Illouz of the Likud Party argued at the conference that the Trump administration makes sovereignty a 'duty to seize right now,' because it will provide 'a diplomatic Iron Dome, defending sovereignty from the international community, until four years from now, Israeli sovereignty will become consensus and irreversible.' Dan Illouz poses for a picture at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem on July 30, 2023. Photo by Yonatan Sindel/Flash90. Yesha Council CEO Omer Rahamim concurred, saying: 'If we lose this opportunity, of a U.S. administration that’s to the right of the Israeli government, it will be a historic miss that we will regret for generations.' The Yesha Council is an umbrella organization of local authorities in Judea, Samaria and the Jordan Valley. Rahamim argued for articulating a plan for encouraging Palestinian emigration from Judea and Samaria. 'It’s just like what President [Donald] Trump is envisioning in Gaza. If it works there, it will work here,' he said. Trump has said that he is committed to relocating Gaza’s population. Currently, Israel and Hamas are observing a tense ceasefire. Under its terms, Israel has agreed to free close to 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including terrorists, in exchange for 25 live and eight deceased hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign in the Gaza Strip after Oct. 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas terrorists invaded Israel and murdered some 1,200 people, abducting another 251. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to dismantle Hamas and retrieve the hostages. Smotrich said on Monday that his Religious Zionism Party will stay in the government if the current phase of the ceasefire with Hamsas in Gaza is extended in exchange for more hostages. His party 'opposes the bad deal with Hamas, which is bad and dangerous, but we decided to stay [in the government]. The deal 'means new victims, new hostages,' Smotrich said, explaining that it would incentivize Hamas to abduct more Israelis. 'We decided not to topple the right-wing government,' said Smotrich. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the head of the Otzma Yehudit Party, pulled out of the government over the ceasefire deal. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a passionate advocate of Israel, sent the conference attendees a recorded video message. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) speaks at the 2024 AmericaFest at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, Ariz., Dec. 22, 2024. Credit: Gage Skidmore/Creative Commons. 'Israel has an absolute right to determine what happens in Judea and Samaria,' said Cruz. 'This right is described in the Bible and it extends through modern times. As you meet today, have confidence that the American people stand with you. And with President Trump and our new Republican Congress, the American government stands with you as well,' he added. In 2019, during Trump’s first term in office, many Israelis on the right prepared for an application of full sovereignty—dubbed annexation by some—in the Jordan Valley. It did not materialize, reportedly to facilitate the Abraham Accords. Led by the Trump administration, the accords established diplomatic relations between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Nadia Matar, a prominent Israeli sovereignty activist who also spoke at the conference, advocated pursuing this in a principled fashion. Israel should insist on applying sovereignty in all of those areas and avoid using sovereignty as an instrument of its realpolitik, she said. Nadia Matar attends a press conference near the Knesset in Jerusalem, Israel on June 12, 2023. Photo by Noam Revkin Fenton/Flash90. Matar had opposed the prospect of applying sovereignty only to the Jordan Valley in 2019, she noted. 'We need to apply sovereignty over the whole of the Land of Israel in accordance with the Bible and to not be afraid of saying what will happen with the Arabs,' she said. Whoever’s 'linked to terrorism won’t stay here, would need to leave willingly or otherwise. The few who remain here, we’ll talk with them about residency,' she added. Several speakers, including lawmaker Simcha Rothman from Smotrich’s party, attended last week’s CPAC Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C. Rothman, chair of the Knesset’s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, said he was impressed by the broad support that Israel enjoyed in the United States, also among conservatives with an America First approach. He remarked on how CPAC demonstrated the commonalities shared by conservative movements internationally.

Poll reveals if Americans back Trump’s plan to move Palestinians ...	Almost half of American voters say they back Trump’s proposal for mass resettlement of Gazans abroad – but few support plan to put Gaza under US control. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff Nearly half of American voters support President Donald Trump’s plan, unveiled earlier this month, to resettle Gaza’s entire population abroad to facilitate the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip – even as a wide majority of Americans oppose the president’s proposal for America to take control over the coastal enclave. On Monday, Harvard/HarrisX published a new poll, conducted between February 19 and 20, surveying 2,443 registered voters. The poll found that only about half (47%) of American voters believe Trump is serious about his plan to take control of Gaza and repatriate the area’s population of roughly two million to third-party countries. The remaining 53% believe the president’s proposal is merely a negotiating tactic. Less than one-third (30%) say they support Trump’s proposal to place Gaza under direct American control, but nearly half (44%) back resettling Gazans abroad. The vast majority of Americans, however, say that Hamas should not be allowed to govern the Gaza Strip again after the war with Israel is completed, with just 22% of respondents saying the Islamist terror group should be allowed to rule Gaza. Nearly four-fifths (79%) of Americans say Hamas must release all remaining hostages immediately and unconditionally or face 'serious consequences.' Broken down by party identification, 86% of Republicans, 75% of independents, and 74% of Democrats agreed with the above statement. Americans are divided along partisan lines regarding their perceptions of Trump’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. In total, 54% of the country approves of his handling of the war, including 85% of Republicans, 49% of independents, and 26% of Democrats. More than half (57%) of Americans say the U.S. should aid Israel in carrying out airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear weapons facilities, while an even wider majority (76%) say those facilities should be destroyed, without specifying how or by whom. Republicans were far more likely to support U.S. aid to an Israeli airstrike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, with 74% backing such a move, compared to 45% of Democrats and 51% of independents. Overall, Americans have a net favorable perception of the Jewish state, on par with Ukraine, while the Palestinian Authority and Hamas are both subject to deeply negative net perceptions. Nearly half (43%) say they have a favorable view of Israel – including 16% who have a very favorable view – compared to 30% who have a negative view, including 13% who have a very negative view, for a net positive of 13 points. Ukraine also has a favorability score of 13 points, while Russia has a net score of negative 56, behind China at -45. Thirteen percent of respondents have a favorable view of the Palestinian Authority, compared to 46% who have a negative view, for a net score of -33 – well ahead of Hamas’s net score of -55, with just 8% of Americans viewing the terror group favorably. Over three-quarters (77%) of respondents favor Israel over Hamas. While a partisan gap does exist on the issue, with 85% of Republicans favoring Israel over Hamas compared to just 69% of Democrats and 76% of independents, the most significant predictor was age. Respondents 18 to 24 were almost evenly divided, with just 54% backing Israel over Hamas and 46% favoring Hamas over Israel. By comparison, 93% of respondents over 65 support Israel over Hamas, followed by 86% of respondents aged 55 to 64, 77% of those 45 to 54, 69% of the 35-44 age cohort, and 62% of those ages 25 to 34.

Hamas may halt ghoulish ceremonies to secure prisoner releases	Hamas may commit to quiet releases of slain hostages, after Israel indefinitely delays the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. By World Israel News Staff Hamas is considering accepting a commitment to transferring the bodies of slain hostages without public ceremonies, in order to advance the release of some 600 terrorists from Israeli prisons. On Saturday, Hamas released five Israeli hostages with a public ceremony, parading the frail-looking hostages in front of a cheering crowd and forcing one of the captives to kiss a terrorist on the head. A sixth hostage - a Bedouin-Israeli - was handed over to the Red Cross without fanfare. In an act of psychological warfare, Hamas published a video showing that it had forced two living hostages to watch the release ceremony of their friends. The hostages were then forced to beg for their freedom on camera. Hours later, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel was indefinitely delaying the release of Palestinian prisoners until Hamas pledges to stop holding release ceremonies. Last week, when Hamas returned the bodies of the Bibas family - who were brutally murdered by their captors - the terror group wrote disparaging messages on their caskets, outraging the Israeli public. This Thursday, Hamas is expected to return the bodies of four slain hostages, but it's unclear if the transfer will take place, as Israel still has not released hundreds of security prisoners who were set for release last Saturday. According to reports from Hebrew-language outlets, Hamas' senior leadership are considering committing to transferring the bodies of two slain hostages without a public ceremony, which would advance the release of prisoners who were expected to be released last Saturday. Hamas may transfer the bodies of two of the slain hostages to Egypt as early as today. Once the bodies are positively identified, Israel will immediately release the Palestinian prisoners, according to a report from Ynet. The current phase of the ceasefire is set to end on March 2nd. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is expected to arrive in Israel on Wednesday in order to broker an extension of the deal, or to facilitate agreements around the second stage of the ceasefire.

Einstein letter offering emigration advice to Jewish refugee to b...	1938 letter penned by Albert Einstein offering advice to a German-Jewish woman seeking refuge from Nazi persecution goes up for sale. By World Israel News Staff A poignant 1938 letter penned by Albert Einstein, offering advice to a Jewish woman seeking to emigrate from Europe to the United States, will be auctioned by Nate D. Sanders Auctions on Thursday, February 27, 2025. The typed letter, signed 'A. Einstein,' is addressed to Mignon Lion, a young German-Jewish woman in France hoping to escape Nazi persecution. Lion, whose mother’s maiden name was Einstein, may have been distantly related to the famed physicist. An immigrant himself to the U.S., Einstein had also fled Nazi persecution, cancelling plans to return to Germany in 1933 while visiting the U.S. following Adolf Hitler’s ascension to power. Residing temporarily in Belgium, Einstein and his wife, Elsa, moved to Britain, amid fears of an assassination plot by German agents in Belgium. In the fall of 1933, Einstein and his wife emigrated to the U.S., after which Einstein was granted a position at Princeton. While Lion and her fiancé eventually relocated to Brazil, her mother tragically perished in Auschwitz in 1945. Her father survived the war and died in New York City in 1964. Dated May 26, 1938, on his personal Princeton stationery, Einstein’s letter provides a realistic assessment of employment prospects in the U.S. He cautions Lion about the difficulty of finding specialized intellectual work, while suggesting possibilities such as domestic service, nursery school teaching, nursing, and handicrafts. He stresses the importance of her fiancé acquiring a viable trade. Einstein also regretfully declines Lion’s request for an affidavit, explaining he had already written too many. This letter offers a glimpse into Einstein’s tireless efforts to assist vulnerable Jews fleeing Europe during this period. While unable to provide direct assistance in this instance, his response demonstrates his concern and willingness to offer practical guidance. The single-page letter, written in German, measures 8.375&#8243; x 11&#8243; and is accompanied by its original envelope, postmarked Princeton, New Jersey, May 26, 1938. Bidding for the letter begins at $5,000.

Lawsuit: Hamas journalist had advance knowledge of Oct. 7	Three rescued Israeli hostage refile lawsuit against US-based nonprofit that employed their Hamas-affiliated captor, who claimed to be a journalist. By World Israel News Staff An amended lawsuit filed against the employers of a Hamas-affiliated Gazan who held three Israeli hostages in his home charges that their captor knew about the October 7th, 2023 terror onslaught in advance. Freed hostage Almog Meir Jan, who was rescued by Israeli forces in June 2024, filed a lawsuit against the Washington-based nonprofit People Media Project and its subsidiary website, the Palestine Chronicle, which employed his captor, Abdallah Aljamal. Aljamal also wrote for Qatar-controlled outlet Al Jazeera. The original lawsuit filed by Jan was dismissed, but has now been refiled with more evidence and the addition of Shlomi Ziv and Andrey Kozlov - who were held alongside Jan and also rescued - as co-plaintiffs. According to court filings viewed by the New York Post, Aljamal had advance knowledge of the attack, proving his deep affiliation and insider connections within the Hamas terror group. On October 7th, 2023, at 5:43 a.m., Aljamal posted an Islamic battle prayer to his TikTok account just minutes ahead of the onslaught. 'Praise be to God, good and blessed praise,' the post reads. 'O God, guide us. O God, guide us. O God, grant us the victory that you promised. O God, acceptance, acceptance, acceptance. Your victory, O God.' Aljamal concluded the post with a heart emoji. The lawsuit argues that Aljamal's employer and Ramzy Baroud, the Palestine Chronicle's editor, obtained exclusive footage and information that made it clear their writer was working on behalf of Hamas. In the aftermath of the October 7th massacres, 'Aljamal’s propaganda in the Palestine Chronicle increased exponentially, often publishing two to three pieces per day, even as the Hamas operative held plaintiffs hostage in violation of international law,' the suit states. The defendants 'knew that Aljamal’s…propaganda could only be made with direct and substantial contacts with other Hamas terrorists providing him information to publish, power for his electronic devices, and Internet access for transmission of materials and communications,' the suit charged. The lawsuit seeks damages from People Media Project, the Palestine Chronicle, and senior figures associated with the entities.

Hamas ‘colonel’ and hospital director admits hostages were kept a...	IDF on arresting Safiya, 'We discovered that the individual orchestrating the terror and Hamas activities within the compound, was the hospital director himself.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A hospital director arrested on suspicion of being a high-ranking Hamas member admitted that hostages were held at the facility. Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, was arrested in late December alongside hundreds of other terrorists. IDF soldiers discovered extensive Hamas infrastructure at the Kamal Adwan Hospital and suspected Safiya of being a Hamas colonel. Safiya denied being a member of Hamas, despite evidence to the contrary. However, he admitted that hostages were kept at the hospital. When questioned, he claimed they were there to receive medical treatment, though freed hostages who had sustained injuries in captivity reported that they did not receive proper care. In January 2025, an IDF interrogation of Hamas terrorists revealed that the terror group had full control of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, Gaza. Israel’s Unit 504 investigators discovered that the hospital director was involved in planning and coordinating terrorist activity and that Hamas terrorists planned to escape from the hospital in ambulances when the IDF raid began. The IDF and Shin Bet, Israel’s security forces, raided the hospital last Friday based on intelligence that terrorists were using the hospital as a headquarters. Approximately 240 Hamas terrorists were arrested in the raid, including many who participated in the October 7 massacre. An IDF reservist described his interrogation of a Hamas terrorist, who admitted that the hospital director was central in directing terrorist activity. The reservist said, 'We discovered that the individual at the center of the event, orchestrating the terror and Hamas activities within the compound, was the hospital director himself.' The reservist added that Dr. Abu Safiya, the hospital director, 'strutted around like a peacock, certain that he wouldn’t be arrested and fully convinced he was in control of the situation.' A second reservist confirmed that the hospital director was indeed a member of Hamas. Abu Safiya 'really did walk around like a peacock,' he said. 'He watched as his doctors were implicated one by one, still convinced he wouldn’t face arrest.' He added, 'But we soon saw through his disguise—it was nothing more than a facade. They were terrorists, with blood on their hands. The hospital director finally realized that the entire ruse had unraveled, and in the end, he too was arrested.'

Hamas official claims October 7th attack wouldn’t have happened i...	Marzouk's admission of regret does not reflect the views of all Hamas leaders, signaling a division within the terrorist organization. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk said that had he known the outcome of the October 7th attack — specifically the destruction in Gaza — the terror group would not have launched the invasion of Israel. His admission of regret does not reflect the views of all Hamas leaders, signaling a division within the terrorist organization. Marzouk, head of Hamas's foreign relations office, told The New York Times that it would have been 'impossible' for him to support the plans for October 7th if he had been aware of the consequences of Israel's military response. Although he was unaware of the specific details of the attack, Marzouk had supported Hamas's general military strategy. He stated, 'Had the consequences of the attack been foreseen, October 7th would not have occurred.' Other Hamas officials have declared 'victory' in the Gaza war, despite the destruction of crucial Hamas infrastructure and the deaths of tens of thousands in Gaza, with at least half of the casualties being members of the terrorist group. Marzouk has indicated he is open to negotiations concerning Hamas's military presence. 'We are ready to discuss any issue,' he told The Times. Marzouk's views contrast with those of Hamas leaders like Osama Hamdan, who has rejected any compromise on Hamas's military control over the Gaza Strip. Marzouk said he would consider a 'comprehensive deal' to release all hostages if Israel agreed to release thousands of Palestinians from prisons, withdrew from Gaza, and ended the war. It remains unclear whether Marzouk's views represent an outlier within Hamas or signal a shift in the group's overall policy. Last week, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Qatar-based Al Araby TV that the terror group was prepared to discuss the implementation of Phase Two of the agreement. Hamdan said the group would abide by the agreement: 'If Israel meets its commitments, we will proceed with releasing the hostages as agreed on Saturday or in the coming days.'

Far-Right AfD rises to second-largest party in Germany	Meanwhile, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats faced a stunning collapse, dropping to just 16.4% from their 25.7% showing in 2021. By Jewish Breaking News A historic wave of German voters braved freezing temperatures on Sunday to cast ballots their ballots. By night’s end, Friedrich Merz’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) emerged victorious with 28.6% of the vote. 'Let’s get the party started,' the 69-year-old told supporters at party headquarters in central Berlin. 'My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA.' 'The interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow. We are under such massive pressure from two sides that my top priority is to create unity in Europe.' The second major story of the night unfolded at Alternative for Germany (AfD) headquarters, where supporters waved German flags as results showed their party securing 20.8% of the vote to become the country’s second-largest party. Not since the 1930s has a far-right party in Germany gained such a large electoral share. 'Never been stronger,' AfD co-leader Alice Weidel proclaimed to cheering crowds. 'We extend our hand to offer cooperation with the CDU. Otherwise, change won’t be possible in Germany.' Founded as an anti-euro party in 2013 before shifting to anti-immigration and nationalist positions, the AfD has called for moving beyond what they term a 'cult of shame' over Nazi atrocities. A stance echoed by party figures like Alexander Gauland, who dismissed the Nazi period as 'bird shit' in German history. However, Merz ruled out working with AfD, viewing the party as a threat to democracy. 'We have fundamentally different views, for example on foreign policy, on security policy, in many other areas, regarding Europe, the euro, NATO,' he said. 'You want the opposite of what we want, so there will be no cooperation.' Meanwhile, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats faced a stunning collapse, dropping to just 16.4% from their 25.7% showing in 2021. A subdued Scholz described it as 'a bitter result' and 'a defeat,' while maintaining defiance toward the far right’s gains, declaring it to be 'something that we can never simply accept.'

Israel denies entry to Hamas supporting European Parliament membe...	The 32-year-old French jurist and politician of Palestinian descent is a member of the far-left France Unbowed party and has been vocal in her criticism of Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS European Parliament member Rima Hassan was denied entry into Israel on Monday, as officials cited her history of support for boycotts and sanctions against the Jewish state. The move came at the directive of Interior Minister Moshe Arbel based on recommendations from the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and the US-based Combating Antisemitism movement. 'Israel is not obligated to admit any foreign official, including parliament members if they work to delegitimize and undermine the state,' said Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli. 'Rima Hassan actively leads hostile campaigns, calls for economic sanctions, and promotes boycotts against Israel. We will use all means available to prevent the exploitation of our democracy for anti-Israeli purposes.' Hassan, who arrived at Tel Aviv’s Ben-Gurion Airport, will be deported to Brussels, from where she departed, the Interior Ministry said. She was intending to visit Palestinian Authority officials in Ramallah. The 32-year-old French jurist and politician of Palestinian descent is a member of the far-left France Unbowed party and has been vocal in her criticism of Israel. Recently, Hassan blamed Israel for the deaths of the Bibas family, repeating claims made by Hamas following their capture. 'Kfir, Ariel, and Shiri Bibas were killed by an Israeli strike,' she wrote on social media. However, Israeli pathologists confirmed that the three were murdered in November 2023. On Sunday, the lawmaker justified Palestinian terror by tweeting 'Resolution 3070 (XXVIII) of the United Nations General Assembly: Reaffirms the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples to free themselves from colonial and foreign domination and control by all means in their power, including armed struggle.' In a November 2024 video, when asked if Hamas terror was justified, Hassan answered 'True,' adding that Israel has no legal right to defend itself. And in May, she called for a boycott of French TV station TF1 after it aired an interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Gazan rocket fired at Israel, hits inside Strip	The Israeli military decided on Sunday to 'increase military and operational readiness' in the area surrounding the Strip. By JNS A terrorist rocket that was fired toward Israeli territory fell short and struck inside the Gaza Strip on Monday afternoon, the Israel Defense Forces said. 'The details are under investigation,' the military statement added. According to reports in Palestinian media, the projectile was launched from the city of Rafah, located in the southernmost part of the Strip. On Feb. 13, a 14-year-old Palestinian was killed in Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip when a terrorist rocket fell short inside the coastal enclave. Unconfirmed video footage posted to social media showed a projectile striking inside a densely populated area shortly after being launched. The Israeli military decided on Sunday to 'increase military and operational readiness' in the area surrounding the Strip. The decision on Sunday night came after a situational assessment, the army statement noted, adding that 'as of now, there is no change in the instructions for the home front.' According to the Channel 12 broadcaster, IDF reinforcements were nevertheless deployed to the border on Monday due to suspicions that Hamas terrorists were planning an attack on Israeli forces in the area. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that it is for the government in Jerusalem to decide whether to resume the war in the Gaza Strip or join the second round of talks with Hamas to free additional hostages. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Mideast envoy, plans to return to the region this week for talks on extending the current first phase of the ceasefire. The 42-day first phase of the truce is currently set to end on March 1. 'We have to get an extension of Phase 1, and so I’ll be going into the region this week, probably Wednesday, to negotiate that,' he told CNN‘s Jake Tapper on Sunday. 'And we’re hopeful that we have the proper time … to begin Phase 2 and finish it off and get more hostages released.' Witkoff said he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'well-motivated' to see the agreement with the terrorist group continue. 'He wants to see hostages released; that’s for sure. He also wants to protect the State of Israel. And so, he’s got a red line. And he said what the red line is, and that is that Hamas cannot be involved in a governing body when this thing is resolved,' Witkoff said of the expected talks.

Senator Fetterman’s staffers quit in protest of his support for I...	At least six aides to the Pennsylvania Democrat have resigned recently in protest of his pro-Israel stance. By World Israel News Staff A number of staffers working for Senator John Fetterman have resigned recently in protest of the Pennsylvania Democrat’s open support for the State of Israel during its war against the Hamas terror organization, Yedioth Aharanoth reported Sunday. The number of resignations rose to six on Friday, with the departure of Communications Director Charlie Hills. Fetterman’s Legislative Director Tré Easton has also announced his plans to leave Fetterman’s office, a departure which will raise the number of resignations to seven. A month earlier, Fetterman’s communications director, Carrie Adams, resigned after she went public with her dissatisfaction with the senator’s positions vis-à-vis Israel and the war against Hamas. 'I don’t agree with him,' Adams told The Free Press. 'I have a sense that his international views are a lot less nuanced than my generation, because when he was growing up, it was might makes right, and for my generation and younger who, of course, are the ones protesting this, they have a much more nuanced view of the region.' Adam Jentleson, Fetterman’s chief of staff and three top communications staffers have also quit over the last year. Citing sources familiar with the resignations, Sunday’s report claimed that the staffers quit due to differences with the senator regarding Israel. One former staffer claimed that the office work environment was 'almost entirely consumed by Israel-related matters.' Fetterman, who campaigned as a progressive in the competitive 2022 Senate race in Pennsylvania, has since frustrated some within the Democratic caucus, softening his positions on some issues and at times cooperating with Congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump. Earlier this month, Fetterman became the sole Democrat to vote to confirm Trump’s Attorney General, Pam Bondi, who was confirmed by the Senate 54 to 46.

Israeli President: ‘No one must be left behind’	Israel suffering immense pain' over killings of Bibas family, says President Herzog, adding that the Jewish state cannot leave any hostages behind in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Israeli President Isaac Herzog called Monday to ensure that every Israeli hostage held captive in the Gaza Strip is returned home, as he lamented the 'immense pain' suffered by Israelis following the confirmation that the Bibas children were killed in captivity. Speaking at the 22nd Jerusalem Conference of the Sheva Media Group on Monday, Herzog said Israel was in the midst of a 'profoundly historic period,' facing continuing threats and an ongoing 'difficult war.' 'First and foremost, we are living in a profoundly historic period for the Jewish people,' said Herzog. 'We are committed to strengthening the people of Israel in the face of the threats that surround us, and this difficult war.' 'We are committed to embracing and supporting the bereaved families who have paid an immense price for our independence, our resilience, and our victory, and to working toward bringing our sons and daughters home. 'Michal and I have met with over a thousand bereaved families this year. The people of Israel are extraordinary—diverse, fascinating—and each family has its own story. I bow my head in remembrance every single day.' Responding to the return of the remains of the two youngest captives taken hostage on October 7th, 2023, Kfir and Ariel Bibas, along with the return of the body of their mother, Shiri Bibas, Herzog castigated the 'heinous' murder of the three, and acknowledged the 'immense' national pain following their return. 'As a nation, the issue that weighs on us most heavily is that of the hostages. The pain is immense, and I know that all of Israel was in deep, national mourning when we learned of the heinous murder of the Bibas family and Oded Lifshitz. At the same time, we long for, rejoice, and weep as we see hostages returning home—they are our brothers and sisters.' Amid fears the ceasefire and hostage deal between Hamas and Israel may not survive to its second phase, Herzog emphasized the importance of returning every hostage from captivity. 'I believe that we must bring them all home and make every possible effort to complete their return, doing whatever is necessary to ensure that not one is left behind.' 'I have had close and personal conversations with both returning hostages and the families of those still held captive. For me, the commandment of redeeming captives is a supreme duty that embodies the highest bond between a nation and its citizens.'

Hitler-loving fighter set to fight Israeli opponent in Denver	Mitchell went fishing for a date with Hitler, and now he’s got a date in the octagon with the living embodiment of Jewish survival. By Jewish Breaking News Mixed martial arts has had its fair share of meaningful fights over the years. But none quite like this one, where timing and circumstance have conspired to create something that feels almost too perfect. Just recently, featherweight Bryce Mitchell was interviewed on the debut episode of 'ArkanSanity' and proceeded to torch his own reputation in spectacular fashion. Between casual sips of whatever was in his cup, Mitchell declared Adolf Hitler was a 'good guy' he’d love to hang out with. 'I really do think before Hitler got on meth, he was a guy I’d go fishing with. He fought for his country. He wanted to purify it by kicking the greedy Jews out that were destroying his country and turning them all into gays,' he said. 'They were gaying out the kids. They were queering out the women. They were queering out the dudes.' 'When you realize there’s no possible way they could’ve burned and cremated six million bodies, you’re gonna realize the Holocaust ain’t real.' The interview dated Jan. 23 was quickly yanked from YouTube over violations of its hate speech policy while UFC CEO Dana White called it the dumbest thing he’s heard in his decades-long career. 'When you talk about Hitler, he was responsible for the death of six million Jews and he tried to completely eliminate a race of people,' White fumed during a pre-fight press conference on Feb. 1st. 'Hitler was one of the most disgusting and evil human beings to ever walk the face of the Earth. And anyone that even tries to take an opposing position is a moron.' 'That’s the problem with the internet and social media; you provide a platform for a load of dumb, ignorant people. We’ve obviously reached out to Bryce, and when we read what he said and let him know what we feel about it, we are beyond disgusted. For those of you who don’t know what’s going on, good, you’re lucky.' Mitchell has since offered what amounts to a tap out of an apology. 'I’m sorry I sounded insensitive. I definitely was not trying to offend anybody, but I know I did. I know that a lot of people died in the Holocaust, and that’s a fact. In the future, I will be much more considerate when talking about the suffering of all peoples,' he wrote on Instagram. 'Hitler did a lot of evil things, I think we can all agree on that. I’m definitely not a Nazi, and definitely do not condone any of the evil things Hitler did.' Now Mitchell’s headed to the PIT Submission Series on Feb. 28 to face Ilay Barzilay, and no publicist’s spin or half-baked apology can sanitize what this Denver fight represents. Mitchell went fishing for a date with Hitler and now he’s got a date in the octagon with the living embodiment of Jewish survival. The kind of poetic justice you can’t script, wrapped in four-ounce gloves and sanctioned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

Meet the terrorist overseeing Abbas’s ‘reformed’ payment system f...	According to Israeli media, the officials described Abbas’s purported reform 'a deception, a cosmetic move, and a facelift designed to gain legitimacy with the U.S. administration.' By Andrew Tobin, The Washington Free Beacon Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas fired his prisoners’ affairs commissioner this week, seemingly demonstrating new seriousness about reforming the system of payments for terrorists that the commissioner oversaw and vocally defended. But Abbas simultaneously replaced the former commissioner, Qadura Fares, with another convicted terrorist and leading proponent of the payments, Raed Abu al-Humus. The incoming boss quickly confirmed his support for killing Israelis. Just hours after his appointment, the Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs published a photograph of Abu al-Humus smiling alongside two arch-terrorists, Ahmed Barghouti and Mohammed Aradeh, whom Israel recently released to Cairo as part of a hostage-ceasefire deal with Hamas. Barghouti, 48, was sentenced to 13 life sentences for orchestrating a series of terrorist attacks that killed 12 Israelis and wounded dozens, and Aradeh, 42, was given life in prison for attempted murder and other crimes. The photo is among a number of early signs that Abbas will once again disappoint international donors who expect him to end 'pay for slay,' as critics call the Palestinian Authority’s longstanding payments to security prisoners and the families of terrorists killed while carrying out attacks against Israelis. 'The problem is the Palestinian Authority believes that terrorists are the most honored people, and they still believe they’re the most honored people,' Itamar Marcus, the director of Palestinian Media Watch, an Israeli watchdog group that has closely tracked the terrorism payments for years, told the Washington Free Beacon. 'They are not saying they’ve decided it’s wrong to reward terrorists. They are saying that this [reform] is something we were forced to do because we’re in a financial crisis. That’s why there’s no meaning to this, and that’s why there’s no reason for any optimism.' In a vaguely worded presidential decree last week, Abbas revoked the Palestinian Authority’s 'financial allowances to the families of prisoners, martyrs, and the wounded' and made the recipients 'subject to the same standards applied without discrimination to all families benefiting from protection and social welfare programs, in accordance with the standards of comprehensiveness and justice.' Abbas also transferred oversight of the terrorism payments from the prisoners’ affairs commission to the Palestinian National Economic Empowerment Institution, a body controlled by his office. International media hailed the move as the 'end' of the terrorism payments and a 'serious reform.' European Commission officials called the 'awaited decree law' a 'significant political development' that 'signals the Palestinian Authority's commitment to implement far-reaching reforms that will improve its efficiency and stabilise its fiscal situation.' 'A reformed and revitalised Palestinian Authority remains at the core of efforts towards a two-state solution,' the officials added in a statement this week. 'Therefore the [European Union] stands firm in its support to the Palestinian Authority and calls on international partners to provide the Palestinian Authority with political and financial support to empower the Palestinian government to continue to pursue its ambitious reform agenda.' A State Department spokesman said last week that Abbas’s decree 'appears to be a positive step and a big win for the Trump Administration.' However, earlier this week, the Trump administration froze funding for the Palestinian Authority Security Forces. Meanwhile, Palestinian officials have reassured the Arab public that the terrorism payments will continue. Abbas affirmed his commitment to the payments at a meeting of his Fatah political party’s parliamentary body on Friday, using the same uncompromising language that he and other Palestinian leaders have often used in the past. 'We repeat and emphasize that we are proud of the sacrifice of the martyrs,' Abbas said in televised remarks. 'Even if we only have one cent left, it will go to the prisoners and martyrs. They must receive everything as in the past, for they are more precious than all of us put together.' Qatar’s Al-Sharq newspaper quoted unnamed senior Palestinian officials last Wednesday as saying the terrorism payments would continue 'without any reduction.' The officials reportedly explained that Abbas’s decree was a response to growing U.S., European, and Israeli financial pressure that has left the Palestinian Authority $3 billion in debt to local banks and unable to borrow more. Munir al-Jaghoub, a senior Fatah official, told the UAE’s Al-Mashhad TV a day earlier that Abbas 'did not stop anyone’s salaries.' According to al-Jaghoub, the president simply 'issued a law to transfer these salaries to another entity that is not subject to restrictions' by the European Union. Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar told international media on Tuesday that the Palestinian Authority has continued 'with its usual deception and its pay-for-slay strategy.' 'Based on their statements and intelligence we have, payments to families of terrorists proceed this week as always,' Saar said. 'The [authority] continues to finance and encourage terrorism.' Saar’s remarks echoed a reported assessment by senior Israeli security officials at a security cabinet meeting on Tuesday. According to Israeli media, the officials described Abbas’s purported reform 'a deception, a cosmetic move, and a facelift designed to gain legitimacy with the U.S. administration.' Abbas’s office, the Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs, and the National Economic Empowerment Institution did not respond to requests for comment. In 2018, the last year the Palestinian Authority published a budget, the terrorism payments totaled $340 million, or 7 percent of planned spending. Abbas’s Palestinian Authority has long used diplomatic and accounting maneuvers to evade international pressure to end the terrorism payments. In 2020, Abbas backed out of negotiations with the Biden administration to reform the system, and in 2014, he attempted to hide the payments by temporarily shifting their distribution to the PLO’s Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs. In the early 2000s, Israel brought in three top international accounting firms as part of an effort to block the PLO’s diversion of funding for the second intifada, a yearslong wave of Palestinian terrorism. But according to Yossi Kuperwasser, then the head of Israeli military intelligence’s research division, the accountants found the Palestinians’ bookkeeping impenetrable. 'It took exactly three months for these elite companies to declare they were leaving because they couldn’t do the job,' Kuperwasser, who went on to become the director general of Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs and now heads the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security think tank, recalled to the Free Beacon. 'All through these games and tweaks, the Palestinians kept paying the salaries to terrorists. So I doubt we are going to see a change this time.' If the Palestinian Authority were to end or significantly reduce the payments, prisoners and their families would undoubtedly lead mass protests that could threaten the authority’s survival, Kuperwasser, Marcus, and other Israeli experts on the Palestinian Authority agreed. The experts said that many of the Palestinian Authority officials in charge of the terrorism payments have long been convicted terrorists who served time in Israeli prisons, and that is unlikely to change. Marcus pointed to Abu al-Humus as an example. While Abu al-Humus’s prisoners’ affairs committee no longer formally oversees the payments, he is listed online as a board member of the body that does, the National Economic Empowerment Institution. 'This is the Palestinian Authority,' Marcus said. 'And the Palestinian Authority is a terror-supporting entity.' In 2022, Abu al-Humus, then the head of international relations at the prisoners’ affairs commission, effusively praised Nasser Abu Hamid, a late founder of Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades terrorist group who died of cancer in Israeli prison while serving seven life sentences for murdering Israelis. Abu al-Humus, who spent 10 years in prison alongside Abu Hamid for his own involvement in terrorism, remembered his late comrade as a 'masked lion' and an 'inspiration' to the 'Palestinian youth.' 'He was not interested in political work but rather focused greatly on the struggle [against Israel],' Abu al-Humus told the Palestinian Wattan News Agency. 'He worked with his colleagues in the resistance to end [Israel] and sweep it from the Palestinian land.'

'I hope you never set a foot into the White House briefing room, you Hamas-propagandizing ghouls,' he wrote. 'Drop dead.' By JNS The Associated Press drew widespread criticism, including from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, for stating that Shiri Bibas and her sons Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 9 months, 'died in captivity.'Close-up of a sign with 'The Associated Press' logo. 'Hamas murdered these hostages. They didn’t just ‘die in captivity,’ as if by natural causes,' wrote Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). 'Why does AP want to sugar coat this?' 'The terrorists of Hamas murder an infant and a child, as well as a mother, in cold blood and with their bare hands,' stated Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.). 'The AP chooses to whitewash the baby killers, calling them ‘militants’ rather than terrorists and claiming the children ‘died’—rather than were murdered—in captivity. Disgraceful.' 'If you are supposed to be the press, then why, why, why can’t you report some facts accurately,' wrote Todd Richman, co-chair of Democratic Majority for Israel. 'She and her sons did not die in captivity. They were murdered! Her babies were choked to death! Shame on you.' Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) wrote a similar response, as did Donald Trump Jr., one of the U.S. president’s sons. David Harris, a former CEO of the American Jewish Committee who is executive vice chair of the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy, wrote that the AP meant 'genocidal terrorists' when it referred to Palestinian 'militants,' and that the news wire was wrong to say the Bibas children and their mother 'died in captivity.' 'No, AP, Shiri Bibas and her young sons, Ariel and Kfir, were kidnapped and murdered by genocidal terrorists,' Harris wrote. 'AP says it’s committed to ‘highest standards of accurate, unbiased journalism.’ Really?' 'Are you actually kidding me AP,' wrote Mark Goldfeder, director of the National Jewish Advocacy Center. 'Died in captivity!? Is it not enough that you hire known Hamas members as photographers, do you now just spout their disinformation for them?' John Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary magazine, referred to U.S. President Donald Trump barring the AP from press briefings.

The two-state solution is dead, says senior Democrat congressman	Rep. Jim Himes, Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee who formerly backed the two-state solution, now acknowledges the idea is likely 'dead.' By World Israel News Staff A senior Democratic congressman said this week that the two-state solution appears to be dead - done in by Hamas invasion of Israel in October 2023. On Sunday, Rep. Jim Himes (CT-D) appeared on Fox News to discuss the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and Trump administration efforts to cut wasteful spending. Himes, a long-time supporter of Palestinian statehood and the two-state solution, acknowledged in the interview that the two-state solution no long appears to be relevant. Responding to a Newsweek article published last week under the headline 'The Two-State Solution Died With Ariel and Kfir Bibas,' referring to the two young Israeli hostages murdered in captivity in Gaza, Himes said the two-state solution likely was already dead, following the invasion of October 7th, 2023. 'As it happens, I just spent a week in Israel and had about two hours with the prime minister, and I think the two-state solution died not with the brutal murder of these hostages, but frankly, it has been on life support for a very long time and the Hamas attack on Israel&#8230;probably ended that.' Himes added that Israel was likely to resume its war against Hamas, citing the terror group's ongoing abuse of hostages, including parading those set to be released. 'You just can't see hostages treated the way these hostages have been treated.' Hamas, Himes continued, must be 'taken out of the equation.' While acknowledging that the two-state solution appears to been rendered irrelevant, Himes said he hoped that Israel and the Palestinian Authority would engage in talks to de-escalate tensions in Judea and Samaria. 'There needs to be some solution,' Himes said. 'There are millions of Palestinians who are enraged.' 'Israel will never be secure as long as they are living in a very small sliver of land with millions of enraged Palestinians.'

Israel lifts all restrictions on northern border communities	This decision enables northern communities to fully resume normal activity, with displaced residents scheduled to return home on March 2. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command has lifted all remaining restrictions on communities along Israel’s northern border, initially imposed due to hostilities with the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah. Sunday’s announcement followed a situational assessment led by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and approved by Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz. Per the new order, the border zone shifted from 'partial activity' to 'full activity' as of 8 p.m. Sunday local time. This decision enables northern communities to fully resume normal activity, with displaced residents scheduled to return home on March 2. The public is instructed to follow updated guidelines available on the National Emergency Portal and the Home Front Command app. Also on Sunday, the IDF raised its alert level in the border area surrounding the Gaza Strip, though no new instructions have been issued for area civilians.

How hostage Omer Shem Tov observed Sabbath in Hamas tunnels	His mother, Shelly, pointed out that she had begun doing the same exactly one year before her son was freed. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Omer Shem Tov, one of the six hostages freed on Saturday, began observing the Sabbath while alone in Hamas captivity, his mother said Sunday. His childhood friend, Itay Regev, who, together with his sister Maya, were with him before being freed in the first hostage deal seven weeks into the war, had spoken out before about how 'one of the things we all missed the most was the Kiddush Friday night,' a benediction said over wine or grape juice at the start of the Sabbath meal. 'Since he was a small boy, Omer was the one who said the kiddush,' his mother, Shelly, recalled. 'One day, they received a small bottle of grape juice and some salted pretzels,' she said. 'They took the salt off the pretzels' and saved it all carefully. 'Every Friday night they took a piece of toilet paper and put it on their heads as a kipah, and Omer said Kiddush,' she continued. They would pretend that a few pretzels were the challah bread eaten at the start of the meal, and Omer would salt them, as is traditionally done, and say the blessing. As other hostages have also mentioned to their loved ones upon release, Omer’s faith in God grew stronger when he was in the terrorists’ hands, Shelly said. She, too, began observing the Sabbath, she said, after joining a weekend run by the group Kesher Yehudi (Jewish Connection), when dozens of hostage families observed the holy day the Orthodox way together with religious families. 'It was a Shabbat that I will never forget - the first Shabbat in my life that I observed according to its rules,' she recalled on Friday as she looked forward to seeing her son. 'The connection between the families of the kidnapped and the ultra-Orthodox families who surrounded us was amazing. We hugged, prayed, sang, and spent a holy Shabbat.' Shelly marveled at the timing of her son’s release, exactly one year later. 'There is no coincidence in the world; everything from Him is blessed, and everyone is a messenger,' she wrote, adding that since then, 'More than I kept Shabbat, Shabbat kept me, and by God's grace, on this Shabbat I will get to hug my Omer, exactly one year later, and it's amazing how precise everything is.' Omer was the hostage ordered by a Hamas photographer for propaganda purposes to kiss a terrorist on the forehead while standing on the stage for the handover ceremony to the Red Cross, as if in thanks for good treatment received as a prisoner. While certain Arab networks seized that footage to 'prove' how humane the terrorists were, Omer was in fact treated horrifically. 'For 450 days, Omer was held alone in a tunnel in difficult conditions that included starvation and psychological torture part of the time,' Shelly said Sunday evening at a press conference. He was not given any medication for his colitis either, she noted. This was the medical condition that had made him eligible to be released as a 'humanitarian case' during this first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. 'Omer shared that all he dreamed of doing when he returned home was to put his head on my lap, and for me to comb his hair, and go out riding with [his father] on the motorcycle and feel the spirit of freedom,' she said. 'When he crossed the border&#8230; the first face he met was that of a psychologist who introduced herself by name, and the first thing he asked for was her permission to give her a hug because he was thirsty for human touch, warmth, and love,' she added.

Trump backs Israel halting release of 600 terrorists	After Netanyahu announces Israel freezing of terrorist releases over Hamas' abuse of hostages - both living and dead - at mass ceremonies - White House gives its backing to Israel's decision. By World Israel News Staff The White House on Sunday announced that it is backing Israel's decision to suspend the release of jailed Arab terrorists in exchange for the return of Israeli hostages from Gaza, after Hamas repeatedly put hostages up on display before freeing them. Over the weekend, the Prime Minister's Office announced that 'in light of the repeated violations by Hamas — including the ceremonies that demean our hostages’ dignity and the cynical use of our hostages for propaganda purposes — it has been decided to delay the release of terrorists planned for yesterday until the next release of hostages is guaranteed, and without the humiliating ceremonies.' The statement was issued hours after Hamas paraded five frail Israeli hostages in front of cheering crowds on Saturday ahead of their transfer to the Red Cross. During one of the ceremonies, Omer Shem Tov, who was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival, was forced to kiss his captor on the forehead. Last Thursday, Hamas displayed the remains of slain hostages, including two children, on a stage at a victory ceremony in Khan Yunis. On Sunday, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes castigated Hamas' behavior, and said that Israel's response is 'appropriate.' 'Given Hamas' barbaric treatment of the hostages, including the hideous parade of the Bibas children's coffins through the streets of Gaza, Israel's decision to delay the release of prisoners is an appropriate response.' President Donald Trump, Hughes continued, said he is 'prepared to support Israel in whatever course of action it chooses regarding Hamas.' In exchange for the latest hostage releases, Israel had been slated to release 602 jailed Arab terrorists this weekend. A senior Hamas official, Basem Naim, warned that unless the terrorists are released, Hamas will not engage in talks with Israel for the implementation of the second phase of the ceasefire.

Bedouin hostage’s father demands Arab world condemn Hamas	We want the Arab world to voice their opinion: What do they think about the fact that innocent people were kidnapped and murdered?' By World Israel News Staff A Bedouin-Israeli father of a recently released hostage, who was held by Hamas for more than a decade, is demanding that the Arab world speak out against the terror group's atrocities. Shabaan a-Sayyid's son Hisham, who has schizophrenia, crossed into the Strip in 2015. He was returned to Israel on Saturday in a near-catatonic state, and appeared to not recognize his own relatives. Speaking to Hebrew-language media, a-Sayyid urged Arab countries to condemn Hamas, whom he said had acted contrary to Islam in their abusive treatment of his son. 'I saw that Bedouins and Arabs were killed, working people who weren’t soldiers or fighters,' said a-Sayyid, referencing the October 7th massacres. 'The Arab world doesn’t react, doesn’t give any response to that, doesn’t take any stance,' he said. 'We want the Arab world, and particularly Arab society in Israel, to voice their opinion: What do they think about the fact that innocent people were kidnapped and murdered?' A-Sayyid said he was shocked by the horrendous treatment his son apparently suffered. 'At the start of [Hisham's] captivity, when there were four hostages in Gaza, I thought that Hamas members would keep him safe,' a-Sayyid said. He said he believed that Hamas understood 'it was in their interest' to ensure his son remained in a good state, so that he could be exchanged for Palestinian terrorists in Israeli prisons. But 'when we got Hisham back, we were relieved to see him walking on his own two feet, but as I held him in my arms, I realized I was hugging a body… not a human being.' The father added that Hisham 'doesn’t talk. He doesn’t have a voice. He can’t remember anything. It’s like he hadn’t been with other human beings.' At least 17 Bedouins were murdered during the October 7th onslaught, and eight were kidnapped. Some were killed by rocket fire, while others were shot to death by rampaging terrorists. One Bedouin man abducted by Hamas, Farhan Al-Qadi, was kept in a subterranean tunnel and given barely enough food to survive, despite being a Muslim.

Freed hostages were isolated in tunnels, starved, and degraded	On Saturday, Hamas released Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham Al-Sayed to Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The six hostages freed on Saturday, like others who have been released, have shared stories of deprivation, humiliation, abuse, starvation, and isolation during their captivity in Gaza. On Saturday, Hamas released Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham Al-Sayed to Israel. Most of the freed hostages describe being held in isolation in tunnels and given very little food. Eliya Cohen was shackled for much of his captivity and was kept alone in darkness. Occasionally, his captors would shine a flashlight in his eyes to create mental confusion. Cohen was captured at the Nova Music Festival and fled into a 'death shelter,' into which terrorists threw grenades that caused now-deceased hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin to lose his arm. Eliya was shot in the leg and did not receive adequate medical attention from his captors in Gaza. He learned only after his release that his partner had survived the terror attack. Hamas captors made Omer Shem Tov disguise himself as a Muslim woman. He was spat on and forced to kiss terrorists in a ceremony. Shem Tov managed to maintain Jewish observance during his captivity and tried to make kiddush with whatever he had. In the final eight months, Shem Tov, Tal Shoham, and Omer Wenkert were held together in a tunnel where they endured extreme humidity and were given very little food. The hostages reported losing track of time and having no idea what month it was. Until he was placed in a tunnel with two other hostages, Wenkert had been held in complete isolation and had no idea there were efforts to free him and the other hostages. Two of the hostages, Hisham Al-Sayed and Avera Mengistu, were held for over a decade in Gaza. Al-Sayed's appearance has entirely transformed, and medical staff have reported that he is suffering from severe psychological trauma. Mengistu greeted his family but has said very little since his release.

Bibas family thanks public for ‘warm embrace, tears’	The family added that those who wish to pay their final respects to Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel can do so along the funeral route, which will be publicized. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Family members of murdered hostage Shiri Bibas and her children Kfir and Ariel issued a statement on Sunday thanking the public for its support. Yarden Bibas, the only member of his family released alive from Hamas captivity, and Dana Siton Silberman, the sister of Shiri Bibas, released a statement following the confirmation that Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel were murdered by terrorists. 'During these painful and difficult days, there are no words to describe the level of gratitude we feel towards all of you. The warm embrace, love, and strength that you have sent us from all over Israel and the world strengthen us and accompany us in these moments of crisis.' They added, 'We feel the open hearts, the immense embrace, your pain alongside ours – which we do not take for granted.' The statement continued, 'This Wednesday, we will accompany Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel on their final journey. We are aware that many of you wish to be there, to pay your respects, express your love, and say your goodbyes with us.' 'However, in order to allow the family to say their goodbyes in the most personal and intimate way, and due to space limitations, the funeral ceremony itself will be limited to family members and close friends.' The family added that those who wish to pay their final respects to Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel can do so along the funeral route, which will be publicized. Additionally, the family is coordinating live-streamed eulogies that will be available for the public to watch. The family concluded, 'We thank you all from the bottom of our hearts – for the love, the embrace, and the tears we have all shared. We do not have enough words to express our appreciation for all that you have given us during this time.'

Air Canada returns to Israel’s skies	With a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas still holding, North American air travel has steadily been returning to Israel. By Jewish Breaking News When Air Canada suspended flights last October, thousands were left navigating complex alternatives through European hubs. A brief attempt to resume service ended abruptly after Iran’s April attacks, but now the airline is committing to a steady return. Starting June 8, Air Canada’s familiar red maple leaf returns to Ben Gurion Airport, with four weekly flights scheduled for Toronto service. Montreal follows in August with a weekly connection, marking the first direct service between Canada and Israel since El Al’s withdrawal in 2022. 'Air Canada has a long-standing commitment to the Canada-Israel route, which we have operated for the past 30 years. We look forward to resuming flights and even expanding them as conditions allow,' the airline announced Thursday. With a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas still holding, North American air travel has steadily been returning to Israel. United Airlines announced resumption of service again on March 15, while Delta eyes a return on April 1. According to the Israel Airport Authority (IAA), about one-third of the 80 airlines that serviced Tel Aviv before the Gaza war have now resumed operations. Wizz Air has already rapidly expanded its network by adding seven new destinations, including Abu Dhabi, Budapest, Krakow, London, Milan, Rome, and Warsaw. Major European carriers, including Air France, British Airways, and the Lufthansa Group have also since resumed service.

Israel sent forces into the 235 sq km buffer zone to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border when Turkish-backed Islamist rebels toppled Assad government. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the demilitarization of southern Syria and protection for its Druze community on Sunday, the first time he has publicly called for this since the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime in December. 'We demand the full demilitarization of southern Syria,' said Netanyahu, who was addressing a graduation ceremony for cadet officers in Beer-Sheva. 'We will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.' Netanyahu also held up a photo of Shiri Bibas and her sons, Ariel and Kfir whose remains were recently returned to Israel. Forensics experts who examined the bodies said they had been murdered, and that there was no evidence to back Hamas claims they were killed during an Israeli airstrike. 'This picture says it all, and I ask that you engrave it on the tablet of your hearts so that we always remember what we are fighting for and who we are fighting against,' Netanyahu said. 'In the last days of the war, [Hamas] murdered Shiri and her children in cold blood. They strangled the tender children with their own hands, and if they could, they would have murdered all of us with the same cruelty,' he added. Regarding Iran, Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s long-standing stance, declaring, 'We will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.' Israel sent forces into the 235 sq km buffer zone to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border when Turkish-backed Islamist rebels toppled Assad government. Israel also launched waves of airstrikes on Syrian army assets and Iranian stockpiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of radical Islamists. Israel considers the 1974 ceasefire agreement void until order is restored in Syria. While Israeli forces have briefly entered the buffer zone in the past, December’s takeover marked the first time since its establishment that the IDF set up positions there. The demilitarized zone was established with a ceasefire in 1974 that ended the Yom Kippur War.

Israeli forces bust Jordanian weapons smuggling ring, arrest 10 s...	The leader of the network, Fuaz Altohi, 28, a resident of the Bedouin Negev town of Bir Hadaj, allegedly paid members tens of thousands of shekels for their participation. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli security forces dismantled a Jordanian weapons smuggling ring, authorities said on Sunday. Ten suspects were arrested as the Israel Defense Forces, Police and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) seized 34 pistols and four long-barreled weapons. The network’s operations focused on moving firearms from the Jordanian border into Israel and then to Judea and Samaria. 'This operation highlights the direct link between arms smuggling at the borders and the supply of weapons to Judea and Samaria, including terrorist organizations. This poses a severe threat to national security,' the Shin Bet said. According to the findings, the group executed at least two major smuggling operations in the latter half of 2024. Smugglers used vehicles crossing from Jordan to transport large quantities of weapons. The leader of the network, Fuaz Altohi, 28, a resident of the Bedouin Negev town of Bir Hadaj, allegedly paid members tens of thousands of shekels for their participation. He also collaborated with two Israeli citizens, a father and son from the Negev, to distribute the smuggled weapons. Security forces believe the weapons ended up in the hands of criminal groups and terror organizations. An indictment filed in Beer-Sheva District Court included charges of illegally possessing and trafficking firearms, damaging IDF property, facilitating illegal border crossings, and drug-related offenses. In the request for pre-trial detention, prosecutors highlighted the rising trend of illegal weapons from Jordan and Egypt flooding Israel.

Witkoff to visit Israel in bid to extend first phase of Gaza host...	Witkoff said he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'well-motivated' to see the agreement with the terrorist group continue. By JNS Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy for the Middle East, plans to return to the region later this week for talks on extending the current first phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal with the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip, he told CNN on Sunday. 'We have to get an extension of Phase 1, and so I’ll be going into the region this week, probably Wednesday, to negotiate that,' the Mideast envoy told Jake Tapper on the channel’s 'State of the Union' program. 'And we’re hopeful that we have the proper time … to begin Phase 2 and finish it off and get more hostages released,' Witkoff continued. The first 42-day phase of the truce is currently set to end on March 1. Witkoff said he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'well-motivated' to see the agreement with the terrorist group continue. 'He wants to see hostages released, that’s for sure. He also wants to protect the State of Israel. And so he’s got a red line. And he said what the red line is, and that is that Hamas cannot be involved in a governing body when this thing is resolved,' Witkoff said of the upcoming talks. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told reporters on Feb. 18 that the Israeli Cabinet has decided to start talks on Phase 2 of the ceasefire. As part of the talks, Jerusalem will demand the complete disarmament of Hamas and other terrorist organizations in the Strip, Sa’ar stressed. And as part of Phase 2, Jerusalem will reportedly also demand the release of all hostages in addition to the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza and the dismantling of its terrorist army. Officials in Jerusalem believe that Hamas is likely to reject the demands. Asked about Netanyahu’s demands, Witkoff told CNN, 'I would say at this point, for sure, they can’t be any part of governance in Gaza.' He added, 'As to existing, I’d leave that detail to the prime minister.' Trump said on Friday that it is for Jerusalem to decide whether to resume the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip or join the second round of talks to free additional captives. Asked by Brian Kilmeade on Fox News whether he was 'okay either way,' Trump answered, 'I am.' Israel on Saturday redeemed six living hostages from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip: Eliya Cohen, 27, Avera Mengistu, 39, Hisham al-Sayed, 36, Omer Shem Tov, 22, Tal Shoham, 40, and Omer Wenkert, 23. According to official estimates, 63 hostages remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza more than 500 days after the terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, 36 of which have officially been confirmed as having been murdered.

Israel challenges Egypt on secret Sinai military buildup	Cairo has constructed military bases in Sinai 'that can only be used for offensive operations, for offensive weapons—that’s a clear violation,' Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Yehiel Leiter said in a Jan. 28 briefing. By Shirit Avitan Cohen, JNS Senior Israeli officials have approached Egypt regarding serious violations of peace agreement terms following mounting evidence of Egyptian military buildup in Sinai that exceeds previously agreed limits. Sources familiar with the matter said Egyptian officials proposed U.S. mediation to reduce growing tensions between the nations. The Israeli diplomatic messages were conveyed amid increasingly concerning social media posts showing the Egyptian army allegedly conducting exercises preparing for a potential invasion of Israel through Sinai. In recent discussions between the sides, Egyptian officials expressed their own concerns, stating that 'entities with foreign interests aiming to destabilize relations between the countries are responsible for distributing the videos, some edited and some fabricated.' Egypt additionally proposed resolving its Sinai violations through accelerated bilateral dialogue to bridge gaps. These diplomatic exchanges follow last month’s remarks by Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Yehiel Leiter, who characterized the situation as 'intolerable' in a meeting with American Jewish organization leaders. Cairo has constructed military bases in Sinai 'that can only be used for offensive operations, for offensive weapons—that’s a clear violation,' Leiter said in the Jan. 28 briefing, a recording of which was shared by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Egypt’s breach 'is an issue that is going to come to the fore because it’s not tolerable,' the Israeli diplomatic envoy explained. 'For a long time, it’s been shunted aside, and this continues. This is going to be an issue that we’re going to put on the table very soon and very emphatically.' Satellite images indicating changes in Egyptian army deployment in the Sinai Peninsula have reportedly led security coordinators in Israeli border towns to paint a worrying picture of recent developments. Security and diplomatic sources confirmed Egypt’s pattern of introducing forces into Sinai in violation of agreements over the years, only requesting Israeli approval after the fact—which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu consistently granted. Yagil Henkin, a military affairs expert who first warned about concerning trends from the south in 2018, explained: 'This happened through creeping annexation. First, they would bring in forces, then retroactively request Israeli approval, which was always given. Even after operational needs ended, forces were not withdrawn.' In recent days, Cairo’s official rhetoric has escalated in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for relocating Palestinians from Gaza. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has made clear that he will not allow the move to happen, even postponing a planned visit to the White House. In his speech to the Conference of Presidents, Leiter said el-Sisi 'plays both sides of the equation, but he is threatened by the Muslim Brotherhood.' If the Israeli military decisively defeats the Muslim Brotherhood branch in the Gaza Strip—Hamas—el-Sisi is 'going to be more open to cooperate with us on the ‘day after’ Hamas,' he argued. The Israeli envoy called it 'unconscionable that Egypt wouldn’t entertain the possibility of at least temporarily housing some of the [Palestinian] refugees, particularly in light of the fact that members of Sisi’s family are running a travel agency in which they take tens of thousands of dollars from Gazans who want to get out of the area.'

‘Fear got us here, and if we don’t fight, we will lose’ – Legenda...	The Hamas-led massacre on October 7 should have been a moment of reckoning for Jews worldwide. Instead, far too many still refuse to see the truth, says prominent radio host. By Linda Argalgi Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News In a no-holds-barred conversation, legendary radio host Sid Rosenberg rips into the explosion of antisemitism, the failures of Jewish leadership, and the urgent need for Jews to take control of their own destiny. Known for his unapologetic, brass-knuckled honesty, Rosenberg isn’t here to play nice. He’s here to tell the truth: Jewish survival has never been about playing defense—it’s about fighting back. And if we don’t, we will lose everything. Jewish survival is a battle—not a birthright Jewish history isn’t defined by victimhood—it’s defined by resilience. But Rosenberg sees today’s Jewish leadership as weak and ineffective. 'When I was a kid, the JDL was tough. The ADL was tough. Neither of them is as tough as they used to be,' he says bluntly. The lesson of Jewish survival is simple: strength is the only deterrent. Yet today, too many Jews are afraid to stand up for themselves—especially those who still blindly support a party that openly harbors antisemites. 'Democrat Jews seem okay with people stepping all over them. There’s no other explanation for why they keep voting for a party that coddles Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, and AOC.' This isn’t about political preference—it’s about self-preservation. And right now, Jewish leadership is asleep at the wheel. Sid Rosenberg and author Linda Sadacka at Bedminster for a Trump Jewish Leader's event. (Courtesy) Antisemitism is institutionalized—and Jews are in denial Jew-hatred isn’t just lingering in the shadows. It’s embedded in the very institutions shaping the country. 'We see it every day at Columbia, NYU, and in Congress—Tlaib, Omar, AOC. Even Jews like Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders do a terrible job representing us,' Rosenberg states. The media only adds fuel to the fire. 'CNN spends all day crying about Palestinian ‘victims’ while barely acknowledging what happened to Jewish women and babies on October 7. It’s pure propaganda.' The greatest mistake Jewish leaders are making? Failing to recognize that antisemitism isn’t just random hate—it’s a systemic problem. 'This isn’t a fringe issue—it’s institutional,' he warns. 'And it’s time we fight it like one.' October 7th: The wake-up call that never came The Hamas-led massacre on October 7 should have been a moment of reckoning for Jews worldwide. Instead, far too many still refuse to see the truth. 'The reason October 7 happened is simple: Iran,' Rosenberg says. 'They bankroll Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. They couldn’t do it when Trump was in office because Iran was broke. The moment Biden took over, Iran was back in business.' And yet, inexplicably, Jews continue to vote for leaders who fund their executioners. 'More than 50 percent, more than 60 percent of Jews still support these policies. Was October 7 a wake-up call? Maybe for me—I became more religious, more outspoken. But for too many? They’re still asleep.' The Jewish community must stop being afraid Fear has paralyzed Jews into submission. And according to Rosenberg, that’s why attacks keep happening. 'If some thug rips a yarmulke off a kid’s head, and that kid beats the hell out of him, maybe he won’t do it again. But we don’t do that. The Jewish response has been to walk away, dejected, scared. And that’s why it keeps happening.' This isn’t about promoting violence—it’s about ensuring that threats against Jews are met with swift, unshakable resistance. 'Those who seek to harm Jews should know there will be a cost,' Rosenberg says. When enemies of the Jewish people see no consequences for their actions, when there is no pushback, no price to pay, it emboldens them. A response isn’t just necessary—it’s survival. The WZO elections: The fight for Jewish power While most people see elections through a political lens, Rosenberg views them as a battle for Jewish survival. 'This election isn’t some symbolic nonsense,' he says. 'This determines how Jewish money is spent, who gets to represent us, and whether Israel will be strong or weak.' Donald Trump is awarded the Theodor Herzl Gold Medallion at the Zionist Organization of America's 125th anniversary Gala in New York City, Nov. 13, 2022. (ZOA) The Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) World Likud is running as Slate 15 in the upcoming World Zionist Congress (WZC) elections, which will take place online from March 10 to May 4, 2025. These elections will determine how over $1 billion is allocated annually toward Jewish and Israeli causes. And the ZOA isn’t just about Jewish power—it stands by Torah values, the anchor that has kept the Jewish people rooted, protected, and unwavering throughout history. For thousands of years, it has never been politics, diplomacy, or compromise that ensured Jewish survival—it was faith, identity, and unbreakable Jewish strength. In an age where Jewish voices are under attack, where so-called leaders bend to every social pressure, ZOA stands firm: Israel is the eternal homeland of the Jewish people, and Jewish destiny will not be dictated by outsiders. Yet, this year, a new threat has emerged: a slate of brand-new groups with zero track record, no proof they can fight, and no experience in standing up for Jewish rights. 'These new slates popped up overnight. No history, no credibility. And we’re supposed to entrust them with the future of Jewish power?' Rosenberg asks. This is not the time for experiments. This is a fight for the Jewish future, and it must be waged by those who have proven their strength. How Sid got into the fight: 'Linda, you were relentless' Rosenberg wasn’t planning to join this battle—he was dragged into it by people who refused to take no for an answer. 'Linda, you were relentless,' he laughs. 'You sent Elizabeth Pipko, Elisheva Chase, and others after me. You made the calls. But in the end, it was Siggy Flicker—my good friend—who sealed the deal. And I’m damn glad she did, because ZOA is the real deal.' For Rosenberg, this isn’t about just another election—it’s about who actually fights for Jewish power. 'A lot of groups just talk—they hold rallies, tweet, and put out statements. But what does that actually accomplish? Nothing.' 'ZOA fights where it matters—in Congress, in court, on the front lines for Israel and the Jewish people.' Real fighters vs. social media celebrities Rosenberg has no patience for performative activism. 'There are people out there making a fortune off this since October 7. They love the photo ops. They have millions of followers. But the real fighters? They’re not the ones tweeting—they’re the ones actually in the trenches.' Ava Rosenberg with her father Sid Rosenberg, a prominent national radio show host. (Courtesy) For him, the ultimate example of Jewish courage isn’t an influencer—it’s his own daughter, Ava. 'What impresses me? Not influencers lighting menorahs with Van Jones for $50,000 a pop. It’s my daughter, Ava. She’s on a college campus, putting her life on the line for the Jewish people when it’s dangerous, when it’s damn near deadly. That’s leadership.' Final message: Fight or be erased Jewish history does not reward weakness. It rewards strength, defiance, and the courage to fight back. We are not guests in this world. We are not here to beg for approval, apologize for our existence, or tiptoe around the sensibilities of those who hate us. The Torah is our anchor. It is the foundation that has carried us through every exile, every war, every attempt to erase us. It commands us to be strong, to fight for our people, and to never surrender our destiny to others. The battle lines have been drawn. The enemy is emboldened. Jewish survival has never been guaranteed—it has always been earned. So stand up. Speak out. Vote. Fight back. Because if we don’t fight for ourselves, no one else will.

Trump’s pick for UN envoy uses CPAC speech to call for ‘eradicati...	‘It has never been more important to show unequivocal support for Israel,’ says New York congresswoman tapped by President Trump to serve as Ambassador to the United Nations. ‘Never forget that Hamas terrorists savagely murdered 1,200 innocents.' By World Israel News Staff A Republican lawmaker tapped by President Donald Trump to serve as America’s ambassador to the United Nations used her speech at the largest annual gathering of conservative activists to reaffirm support for Israel and to call for the ‘eradication’ of the Hamas terror organization. New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland on Saturday, lauding President Trump’s position on the Israel-Hamas conflict while lambasting the United Nations relief agency UNRWA. Amid accusations of ties to terrorism – including to Hamas and terrorists involved in the October 7th invasion – Stefanik called to 'dismantle' the agency. 'Make no mistake. Hear it now,' Stefanik told CPAC attendees. 'We will not only defund UNRWA, we will dismantle it,' calling the UN agency a 'pro-Hamas terrorist group that committed atrocities on Oct. 7.' During his first term as president, Trump defunded UNRWA, a move which was later reversed by his successor, President Joe Biden. However, in 2024, following revelations of involvement by UNRWA employees in the October 7th massacres, the Biden White House suspended funding for UNRWA, while finding alternative mechanisms for supporting international aid to Palestinians in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. While the Biden-era freeze is slated to expire next month, UNRWA funding is also restricted by a January 20th executive order signed by Trump after returning to office, freezing nearly all foreign aid. Stefanik called for the ‘eradication’ of Hamas, citing the murder of Israeli hostages returned to Israel last week – including three members of the Bibas family. 'It has never been more important to show the world’s unequivocal support for Israel. We will not rest until every hostage is brought home and Hamas is eradicated.' 'This past week, we continue to see with crystal clarity that our fight to support Israel and eradicate Hamas is a fight between good and evil, light and darkness, life and death.' 'The world must never forget that Hamas terrorists savagely murdered over 1,200 innocent civilians—including women, children, the elderly and babies—and took hundreds hostage, committing unspeakable atrocities against humanity.'

40,000 Palestinians evacuated as IDF deploys tanks in Samaria	For the first time since 2002, IDF tanks roll into Jenin as Israeli Defense Minister signals Israel will maintain long-term presence in the city, noting 40,000 Palestinians evacuated. By World Israel News Staff IDF tanks rolled into the Palestinian Authority city of Jenin in northern Samaria on Sunday, marking the first time since the Second Intifada that Israeli armored units have operated in the area. On Sunday morning, photographs and video began circulating on social media outlets showing Israeli Merkava main battle tanks being deployed to Jenin and nearby Arab villages. An IDF spokesperson later confirmed that tanks were operating in the area as part of the ongoing Israeli counter-terror operation in Samaria. Since January 21st, Israeli forces have killed more than 70 terrorists and detained 300 suspects in Operation Iron Wall, carried out in the Jenin district of northern Samaria and Tulkarem and the nearby Nur al-Shams in western Samaria. The operation was launched after Palestinian Authority security forces failed to take control of Jenin from rogue terror groups, and following the January 6th shooting attack in Samaria that left three Israelis dead. Later on Sunday, Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) discussed the expansion of Operation Iron Wall, saying that some 40,000 Arab residents have been evacuated from the targeted areas. 'The IDF is expanding its operations in northern Samaria and, as of last night, is also operating in the town of Qabatiya as part of Operation Iron Wall to combat terrorism in Judea and Samaria. The military is reinforcing its forces with armored units and additional troops,' Katz said in a statement. 'So far, 40,000 Palestinians have evacuated from the refugee camps of Jenin, Tulkarm, and Nur al-Shams, which are now empty of residents.' Furthermore, Katz said the Israeli military will remain in parts of Jenin and Tulkarem for an extended period of time, without giving a deadline for their withdrawal. 'We are at war against Islamic terrorism in Judea and Samaria. I have instructed the IDF to prepare for a prolonged stay in the cleared camps for the coming year—to prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism.' During the recent operations, Katz added, IDF forces have shut down operations by the terror-linked United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). 'UNRWA operations in the camps have also been halted.' 'We will not return to the previous reality. We will continue to clear refugee camps and additional terror hubs to dismantle the battalions and terror infrastructure of radical Islam, which were built, armed, funded, and trained by Iran's axis of evil in an attempt to establish an eastern terror front against the settlements of Samaria, the security barrier, and major population centers in Israel.'

Terrorist murderer dies in accident days after release	Na'el Obeid, a terrorist convicted of seven murders for role in suicide bombing attack, dies in accident at his Jerusalem home, just days after he was released as part of the hostage deal between Hamas and Israel. By World Israel News Staff A convicted terrorist from Jerusalem, responsible for a deadly terrorist attack more than two decades ago, died over the weekend in an accident just days after he was released from prison. Last week, Israel’s Prison Service released Na’el Obeid, a Jerusalem resident convicted during the Second Intifada of helping to carry out a suicide bombing at an Israeli café in the capital. The September 2003 Café Hillel bombing left seven Israelis dead and 57 more injured. The victims killed in the suicide bombing attack included two Americans: Dr. David Applebaum and his daughter, Nava Applebaum, who was murdered on the eve of her wedding. Other victims of the bombing include, David Shimon Avizadris, Shafik Kerem, Alon Mizrachi, Gila Moshe, and Yehiel Tubol. Following his capture, Obeid was tried and convicted for his role in planning the attack and aiding the suicide bomber. Obeid was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences, plus 30 years in prison. Prior to his release last week, Obeid had served 21 years of his sentence. In exchange for the release of three Israeli civilians freed on February 15th – including Sagui Dekel-Chen, Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov, and Iair Horn – Israel released 369 jailed Arab terrorists, including Obeid, who returned to his home in the Issawiya neighborhood of eastern Jerusalem. This Saturday, however, Obeid was rushed to Hadassah Medical Center on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem after he suffered critical injuries. Obeid was reportedly injured after falling from the roof of a building Issawiya. After being evacuated to the hospital in critical condition, Obeid was later declared dead by doctors at Hadassah.

Pope is conscious, receiving supplemental oxygen, had a peaceful ...	His condition has revived speculation about what might happen if he becomes unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, and whether he might resign. By The Associated Press Pope Francis was conscious but still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen Sunday following a respiratory crisis and blood transfusions, as he remains in critical condition with a complex lung infection, the Vatican said. The brief statement early Sunday didn't mention if Francis was out of bed or eating breakfast, which it had on previous days. 'The night passed quietly, the pope rested,' it said. The Vatican later said Francis was conscious, continuing to receive supplemental oxygen and that further clinical tests were being conducted. A more detailed medical update was expected later Sunday. On Saturday, doctors said the 88-year-old pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was in critical condition after suffering a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection. The pope received 'high flows' of oxygen to help him breathe through a nasal tube. He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, the Vatican said in a late update. The Saturday statement also said that the pontiff 'continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more discomfort than yesterday.' Doctors said the prognosis was 'reserved.' Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. His condition has revived speculation about what might happen if he becomes unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, and whether he might resign. Prayers for pope at Vatican Francis was supposed to have celebrated Mass on Sunday morning in St. Peter's Basilica and ordained deacons as part of the Vatican's yearlong Holy Year commemoration. The organizer of the Holy Year, Archbishop Rino Fisichella, celebrated the Mass in his place and offered a special prayer for Francis from the altar before delivering the homily the pope had prepared. 'Even though he is in a hospital bed, we feel Pope Francis close to us, we feel him present among us,' Fisichella told the hundreds of white-robed deacons. 'And this compels us to make even stronger and more intense our prayer that the Lord will assist him in his time of trial and illness.' A pre-written message that Francis had prepared for his Sunday noon prayer but did not deliver said he was 'confidently continuing my hospitalization at the Gemelli Hospital, carrying on with the necessary treatment; and rest is also part of the therapy!' The message noted the upcoming anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 'a painful and shameful occasion for the whole of humanity.' The main threat facing the pope is sepsis Doctors have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. Saturday’s blood tests showed that he had developed a low platelet count, a condition called platelopenia or thrombocytopenia. Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal. Low platelet counts can be caused by a number of things, including side effects from medicines or infections, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Francis, who has chronic lung disease and is prone to bronchitis in winter, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Vatican hierarchy tamps down speculation Francis might resign Meanwhile, the Vatican hierarchy went on the defensive to tamp down rumors and speculation that Francis might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to speculation and rumors about a possible resignation. It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret. Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat-out denied that any such meeting occurred. Parolin said such speculation seemed 'useless' when what really mattered was the health of Francis, his recovery and return to the Vatican.

Israeli hostages forced to watch as other captives set free	Hamas released a propaganda video of Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David forced to watch from a van Saturday as other hostages were released. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Two hostages were forced by Hamas to watch its choreographed ceremony in which three Israelis were released Saturday in Rafah, and were filmed begging repeatedly for their own freedom. Looking extremely gaunt, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, dressed identically in light sweaters in the freezing cold, can be seen in a van first covering their eyes with their hands in disbelief as they watch Omer Shem Tov, Tal Shoham and Omer Wenkert up on a stage being forced to speak before being taken to Red Cross vehicles. Sitting across from well-armed terrorists, the two then face the camera and say, 'Please save us, bring us home, I’m begging you.' They are cruelly asked in Hebrew, 'How do you feel right now?' and they repeat with tears in their voices, 'Please let us go home, we’ve been here 500 days, please save us&#8230; we want to be like them,' nodding at the Israelis being humiliated in the handover ceremony. The door of the van is then slammed shut and they say to the camera in separate shots that have been obviously pieced together, '[Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, you’ve finished us off, you killed us here&#8230; We need proper negotiations, simply sign on a deal and finish this, we’ve just seen our friends released after 500 days, [if you use] military pressure, we’ll all die&#8230;. People of Israel, don’t stop demonstrating, it is so hard for us here.' Right-wing members of the government have been demanding that the IDF return to crush Hamas instead of agreeing to a Phase 2 where the IDF would fully withdraw from Gaza in return for the 63 remaining hostages, only 27 of whom are still alive. Galia David, Evyatar’s mother, was interviewed Sunday by several radio stations after the two- minute clip was released. She told Army Radio that while 'it was obvious that he had been staged,' her son was still obviously 'frightened and frustrated' and that 'his whole body language expressed distress.' David was relieved that her son was at least with his close friend in captivity, saying that it was a 'consolation' that he and Gilboa-Dalal were 'alive and together,' and adding that 'I have no doubt that they give each other a great deal of strength.' 'But I see the soul through his eyes and he is tormented, my son is tormented. He is pale and thin, but we keep saying - the body can be healed, the soul is much more difficult,' she said. 'We must save them, and as quickly as possible. If it doesn’t happen now, I don’t know how much longer they can hang on there.' On Channel 12, she also slammed Hamas’ malice, noting that the terrorists 'let him look at his friends who were with him in the tunnels and are going home, and then sent back to the darkness to wander in the tunnels when he doesn't know what's happening to him. This is simply cruelty.' Hamas terrorists abducted Gilboa-Dalal and David from the Nova festival on October 7, 2023, among 249 others during their invasion of Israel in which they slaughtered 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians.

US Rep. Nancy Mace torches colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for...	Mace was responding to an April 2024 clip from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, in which Ocasio-Cortez accused Israel of inflicting a famine on Gaza as revenge for Oct. 7. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner US Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) has lambasted fellow Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) over her previous suggestions that the United States cut funding to Israel for humanitarian purposes. Mace posted on social media that she is currently visiting Israel to witness the aftermath of the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks which left roughly 1,200 dead and 250 abducted. 'I’m in Israel where last night 3 buses were bombed. I’m here to see the evil that invaded Israel and deeply harmed her Jewish people on 10/7,' Mace wrote. 'We gave $9 billion in humanitarian and disaster aid for Gaza last year – at least half of which, $4.5 billion since AOC can’t count, ended up funding terrorism. Our resources have enabled mass terrorism in Gaza and elsewhere. See UN and USAID as additional examples,' Mace continued. 'Also – what’s democracy to terrorists who want to kill all Jews and Christians. Move to Gaza since you and your caucus love Hamas so much.' Observers have argued that humanitarian funding for Gaza, including money from the US, often ends up going to the Hamas terrorist group, the most powerful and organized faction in the Palestinian enclave. Many countries, including the US, have paused funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which is responsible for Palestinian refugees and their descendants, for harboring close ties to Hamas terrorists. The Israeli government and research organizations have publicized findings showing numerous UNRWA-employed staff, including teachers and school principals, directly participated in the Oct. 7 attacks. Mace was responding to an April 2024 clip from 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,' in which Ocasio-Cortez accused Israel of inflicting a famine on Gaza as revenge for Oct. 7. The firebrand progressive accused Israel of 'human rights' violations in Gaza and argued that the Jewish state has undermined Palestinian 'civil rights.' Ocasio-Cortez lamented that 'US taxpayer assistance' has helped facilitate what she considers a dereliction of American values. 'It’s not just about Israel. It’s not just about Gaza. This is about us, because this is US taxpayer assistance and what is being financed with our resources, and if any conflict is going to have US resources, then it does become a matter of our values,' Ocasio-Cortez said to Stephen Colbert. She then called on the United States to reaffirm its 'commitment to human rights, to the sanctity of civil rights, to the rules of war' by canceling arms transfers to Israel. Over the past year, Ocasio-Cortez has repeatedly condemned the Jewish state’s response to the Hamas terrorist group’s brutal Oct. 7 slaughter of roughly 1,200 people throughout southern Israel. She has accused the Jewish state of committing a 'genocide' and 'ethnic cleansing' in Gaza, arguing that the conflict has been 'generationally radicalizing' for young Americans. She has also boasted of leading a 'whip operation' to garner votes from fellow Democrats to block aid to Israel. Since entering Congress in 2021, Mace has often defended Israel. Earlier this week, Mace repudiated Palestinian American supermodel Bella Hadid for holding a map that depicts the elimination of Israel. In May 2024, Mace defended Israel’s military conduct in Gaza as 'biblical warfare,' and she has slammed her Democratic colleagues for not being more outspoken about the widespread rapes of Israeli women during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 rampage. 'I can’t think of anything more shameful than to see these women’s groups, to see women on the left, women in the House, my colleagues on the left who refuse to say what this is, which is shameful. It’s disgusting. It’s barbaric,' she said. 'And we ought to be condemning it from every corner of our country. Every woman should be condemning this. And I think it’s shameful.' The post US Rep.

Tanks seen in Jenin area for first time in over 20 years as Israe...	Since January 19, Israeli forces have arrested more than 200 terror suspects, eliminated 71 others who were deemed security threats, and confiscated more than 300 weapons and explosives. By Ehud Amiton, TPS Israeli tanks were seen in the area of Jenin on Sunday as the Israel Defense Forces confirmed it was expanding its counterterror operations in northern Samaria. It marked the first deployment of tanks in Judea and Samaria since 2002. This deployment follows the Thursday night bombings of buses in Bat Yam and Holon. In a rare visit to the Tulkarem refugee camp on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to escalate the fight. 'In the past year, we have greatly increased our activity,' Netanyahu said as he visited troops and was briefed by commanders. 'We are entering the terrorist strongholds, clearing entire streets used by terrorists, their homes. We are eliminating terrorists and commanders.' Nobody was killed in Thursday night’s bombings. On one bus, a passenger noticed a suspicious unattended bag with wires sticking out and Arabic writing. She alerted the driver who evacuated the vehicle. Three other buses were blown up in separate bus depots while another unexploded bomb was found on another bus. The words, 'Revenge from Tulkarem' were found written in Arabic on one of the bags. An Israeli Jew, a Palestinian, and a third suspect were reportedly arrested on Friday for the attacks on buses. The Israel Defense Forces launched an ongoing counterterror raid in the Jenin refugee camp on Jan. 19. It has since expanded to the Palestinian city Tulkarem and an area of Samaria known as 'the Five Villages.' The raids, dubbed 'Operation Iron Wall,' come on the heels of the Palestinian Authority’s failed crackdown in the Jenin refugee camp. Troops have arrested around 200 terror suspects, seized weapons and explosives, and uncovered a bomb-making laboratory. Since January 19, Israeli forces have arrested more than 200 terror suspects, eliminated 71 others who were deemed security threats, and confiscated more than 300 weapons and explosives. In Jenin, a suspect was apprehended after being caught handling explosive devices. A subsequent search revealed a cache of 20 ready-to-use explosives and a grenade body at a construction site. Since the October 7 attacks, Israeli forces have arrested 6,000 wanted Palestinians in counterterror operations in Judea and Samaria. Around 40 percent were affiliated with Hamas.

IDF strikes Hezbollah targets ahead of Nasrallah’s funeral in Bei...	The IDF on Saturday night struck a Syria-Lebanon border crossing through which Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah was attempting to smuggle weapons, according to the Israeli military. By JNS The Israeli military on Sunday struck a Hezbollah site in Lebanon, targeting rocket launchers and weapons. Several rocket launchers in Southern Lebanon which posed an imminent threat to Israeli civilians were also neutralized, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The military stated that Hezbollah’s continued actions violate established understandings between Jerusalem and Beirut and endanger the State of Israel and its citizens. The IDF emphasized that it remains committed to eliminating any threats against Israel. The operation came just hours before Hezbollah prepares to bury its former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh. According to Israel’s Channel 12 News, Israeli drones were reportedly observed flying over the Lebanese capital as preparations for the funeral intensified. Nasrallah, who led the Iranian terror proxy for over three decades, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sept. 27. The funeral ceremony is scheduled to take place in the afternoon at Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, Lebanon’s largest sports arena, with tens of thousands expected to attend. IDF strikes Hezbollah smuggling routes on Lebanon-Syria border The IDF on Saturday night struck a Syria-Lebanon border crossing through which Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah was attempting to smuggle weapons, according to the Israeli military. The IDF called these attempts a 'blatant violation' of the ceasefire between Jerusalem and Beirut and vowed to 'prevent any attempt by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to rebuild its forces.' Saturday’s strike came after the Israeli Air Force overnight Thursday attacked several border crossings it said were being used by Hezbollah to smuggle in weapons. A day earlier, an Israeli drone strike on a vehicle in Ayta al-Shaab in Southern Lebanon killed an armed Hezbollah terrorist, according to the IDF. That strike in turn came a day after the deadline for a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory under the U.S.-brokered Israel-Lebanon ceasefire went into effect on Nov. 27. Last Monday, the IDF confirmed that troops would remain deployed at five strategic outposts in Southern Lebanon, citing the Lebanese Armed Forces’ failure to fully deploy in the area in place of Hezbollah, as required by the terms of the truce. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday vowed to continue to act against Hezbollah 'at full strength.' 'We will not allow a return to the reality of Oct. 7,' he declared, referring to the 2023 Hamas-led massacre in Israel’s south.

Following murder of child hostages, Argentina mulls renaming Pale...	Argentina's capital city to consider measure which would rename Buenos Aires' State of Palestine Street after the Argentinian-Israeli children murdered while in captivity in the Gaza Strip. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Argentina's capital city is considering renaming a street after victims of the Hamas terror organization who were killed while in captivity in the Gaza Strip. Last week, Yamil Santoro, a city councillor in Buenos Aires, drafted a measure which would, if passed, rename the 'State of Palestine Street,' (Estado de Palestina) changing it to 'Bibas Family Street,' (Familia Bibas), in honor of the three members of the Argentinian-Israeli family who were murdered by Hamas terrorists while in captivity in the Gaza Strip. On Thursday, Hamas returned the remains of the two sons of Yarden and Shiri Bibas - Kfir and Ariel - the two youngest hostages abducted from Israel on October 7th. After falsely presenting the remains of another woman as the body of their mother, Shiri, Hamas returned Shiri Bibas' remains over the weekend. While Yarden, a dual Israeli-Argentinian national, was returned alive to Israel earlier this month, his wife and children - who received Argentinian citizenship through their father - were apparently killed in November 2023. Israeli forensics examiners say it appears the two Bibas children were murdered by terrorists who used their bare hands, refuting Hamas' claims they were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Mrs. Bibas' remains also showed no signs her injuries were caused by an airstrike. 'We are introducing a bill to change the name of the street from 'Palestine' to 'Bibas Family,'' Santoro announced last Thursday. 'It is essential to remember and honor the victims of terrorism.' 'Without prejudice to this idea/proposal, if you believe there is another initiative we can promote from the Buenos Aires Legislature to honor the victims and combat terrorism, I would like to hear it.' The street in question, located in Buenos Aires' Almagro neighborhood, was renamed 'State of Palestine Street' in December 2013, after previously being simply called 'Palestine Street,' a symbolic gesture of recognition of unilateral Palestinian statehood. 'State of Palestine, understood as the government that was established to look after its interests, was co-opted by the terrorist group Hamas and has led to us being faced with a failed state that prioritizes the search for the extermination of its neighbors,' Santoro said. 'Recognizing a failed state, appropriated by terrorism, is a deliberate act of forgetting and omitting the atrocities committed.' In addition to political opposition, the measure will face technical hurdles, owing to a 1998 law which prohibits naming public areas after people who have been dead for less than 10 years. Santoro hopes that by naming the street after the Bibas family, rather than individual members of the family, his measure can skirt the restriction. Buenos Aires is not the only city in Argentina, or even in the State of Buenos Aires, with a street named 'Palestine.' In November 2022, Santa Clara del Mar, a municipality in the State of Buenos Aires, renamed a main road 'Palestine Street' in recognition of the 34th anniversary of the Palestine Liberation Organization's declaration of statehood in November 1988.

Hostage was ‘broken by Hamas,’ says father	Hisham al-Sayed, a hostage of Hamas for almost a decade, 'does not communicate' and is in 'a very bad state,' said his father. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hisham al-Sayed, who was released Saturday after being a prisoner of Hamas for two months short of a decade, was broken by Hamas and is in poor mental condition, his father told Hebrew-language media Saturday. Al-Sayed, who had reportedly been diagnosed with schizophrenia and a personality disorder in his youth and was institutionalized several times, was not forced to participate in a humiliating release ceremony. He was simply brought to a Red Cross vehicle in Gaza City which then drove him over to IDF forces who took him to Ichilov Hospital to be examined and meet his family. A Hamas official told Al-Jazeera that this was done out of 'respect for his family and the Arabs of Israel,' and because he has Palestinian roots,' but the family rejected the statement out of hand. 'He was in a torture camp,' Al-Sayed’s father Shaaban told Ynet. 'They didn't want people to see what condition he was in, so there was no ceremony.' 'Hamas are liars,' he added. 'If they had any respect for people, they would have released him a long time ago&#8230;. As a Muslim, I am furious with Hamas.' Speculating that his son had been isolated while in captivity, Shaaban said his son returned 'broken and is in a very bad state. He almost doesn’t speak, and if he does, it’s only in a whisper, and he lowers his head.' In an interview with Channel 12, he excoriated Hamas again. Hisham 'is not well, he was not in our world. A kind of Tarzan after living for 10 years with animals. He does not communicate,' he said. 'He tries to talk and to share, but he doesn’t succeed,' the father added. 'He says a lot of incomprehensible things. He speaks in a whisper, maybe out of fear. I believe he is in a state of mental torture.' In videos released of his family greeting him in the hospital, al-Sayed can be seen with a completely expressionless face, being hugged briefly by one person after another. A few members said he should have been freed together with the other hostages. 'There should be no difference between him and the Jewish hostages. It makes us feel like he is better than them but for us each of the hostages is important, regardless of his faith,' they said. Jewish Ethiopian-Israeli Avera Mengistu, who also suffered from mental problems and had wandered into Gaza in 2014, was freed in a ceremony in Rafah along with Tal Shoham, a resident of Kibbutz Be’eri whom Hamas had abducted on October 7, 2023, along with 250 others during their invasion of southern Israel. Hisham had attempted to get into Gaza several times before 2015 during long walks he took alone. He often went where he shouldn’t, according to an earlier statement by his father to Human Rights Watch. 'He likes the attention when he goes places he knows are forbidden,' Shaaban said, noting that he had also twice crossed illegally into Jordan, and had even once succeeded in entering the Gaza Strip. 'In 2010, he went to Gaza too, and the Bedouins we know there helped return him within 24 hours,' he said. 'But the Hamas leadership changed in 2014 and his luck ran out.'

Netanyahu rejected plan to assassinate Hamas chief days before Oc...	Israeli prime minister denies report that top security official lobbied Netanyahu to approve plan to assassinate Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas forces in Gaza, less than a week before the October 7th invasion. By World Israel News Staff A top Israeli security official presented Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a plan to assassinate the senior Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip just days before the October 7th, 2023 invasion, a report by Israel's Channel 12 claims. According to the report Saturday night, on October 1st, 2023, Ronen Bar, chief of the Shin Bet internal security agency, lobbied Netanyahu to approve the targeted assassination of Yahya Sinwar, the de facto ruler of the Gaza Strip and mastermind of the invasion of Israel, launched just six days after the plan was reportedly proposed to Netanyahu. Netanyahu is said to have ignored Bar's request to green light the targeted killing. Channel 12 claimed that Saturday's report was based on material collected by the Shin Bet from its own probe into the security failures ahead of and during the October 7th invasion. Among other things, the probe reportedly found that the Shin Bet underestimated the capabilities of Hamas' elite Nukhba Force, which spearheaded the October 7th invasion. As such, the agency did not address warnings of an impending invasion. However, the report states that despite the agency's failure to properly assess the threat posed by the Nukhba Force in the days and hours leading up to the invasion, successive heads of the Shin Bet are said to have warned of Hamas' growing military capabilities and urged the government to carry out targeted killings of senior Hamas officials in Gaza, including Sinwar and Muhammed Deif, chief of Hamas' military wing. Since September of 2023, according the report, the Shin Bet deliberated on steps to increase overall security readiness vis-a-vis a possible campaign in Gaza. On October 1st, during an operational meeting with senior security officials, Bar reportedly advised Netanyahu to okay the Shin Bet's plan to assassinate Sinwar. The Prime Minister's Office, however, vociferously denied the claim, which it denounced as a 'complete lie.' 'The truth is the exact opposite. On the 1st of October 2023, Prime Minister Netanyahu held a situational assessment on the subject of Gaza, during which the Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar recommended that [Israel] grant Hamas benefits to [Gaza] civilians in exchange for quiet.' 'Bar even said that targeted killings should be avoided in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon, in order to prevent another round of [fighting] in Gaza.' The PMO added that two days later, on October 3rd, Bar argued that Hamas was working to avoid a conflict with Israel, claiming that it was possible to maintain long-term stability between Israel and Gaza. Saturday night's report and the PMO's response come amid reports Netanyahu is planning to replace Bar as Shin Bet chief - a claim the PMO has denied. Critics of the prime minister have linked his alleged plan to fire Bar after the Shin Bet completes its ongoing probe of the October 7th security failures to the agency's investigation into ties between several Netanyahu aides in the Prime Minister's Office and the Qatari government. According to recent reports, several public relations officials from the PMO were paid by Doha to improve Qatar's image in Israel.

Trump: ‘Disgraceful’ how Hamas is treating Israeli hostages	President Trump laments poor condition of Israeli hostages returned from the Gaza Strip, blames Biden for October 7th invasion and failure to bring back the hostages. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump castigated the Hamas terror organization over the weekend, citing its abuse of Israeli hostages held in captivity in the Gaza Strip. Speaking with reporters briefly before departing the White House Saturday for an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, the president lamented that the six Israeli hostages returned to Israel from the Gaza Strip earlier in the day appeared to be 'not in great shape.' 'We had a lot of news over the last 24 hours. We had the hostages given back today, it’s disgraceful what’s going on there,' Trump said. 'They’re not in great shape, but we’ve also seen them in worse shape. What a terrible situation it is.' Later that day, during his CPAC address, Trump blamed his predecessor for the October 7th invasion, reiterating previous claims that the Biden White House's softening of economic measures against Iran, including the unfreezing of Iranian assets and sanctions waivers, had enabled Tehran to fund proxy groups including Hamas and Hezbollah. 'October 7th - Israel - would have never happened if I was president. It would have never happened. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah. They had no money to give. Everybody knows that. Jewish people in the audience know that. Iran was broke. They were not giving money around.' 'When I got out [of office], [the Biden administration] took all the sanctions off, and Iran became rich very quickly. With oil, you can become rich very, very quickly. And the rest is history. What a horrible thing.' Trump also accused Biden of failing to secure the release of any hostages taken on October 7th, 2023. 'Even though the hostages are coming back, I saw this morning that we got six more back. Biden got none, by the way&#8230;none, zero. He would have never gotten any of them back.' 'But they're coming back in pretty bad shape. It's a horrible thing. And many are dead. Many are dead. So we'll see how that all ends up. But I just want you to know we're working on that.' In November 2023, Hamas released 105 hostages - including 81 Israeli nationals - as part of a ceasefire deal brokered by Qatar, Egypt, and the Biden administration.

Prisoner releases indefinitely halted until hostage ceremonies st...	600 Palestinian prisoners waited on buses for hours, before being told their release was delayed and they needed to return to their cells. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indefinitely delayed the release of Palestinian prisoners, including those who were expected to be released Saturday following the return of six living Israeli hostages, according to a government statement. On Saturday, Hamas held two separate ceremonies in which they paraded five frail Israeli hostages in front of cheering crowds, ahead of their transfer to the Red Cross. During one of the ceremonies, Omer Shem Tov, who was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival, was forced to kiss his captor on the forehead. 'In light of the repeated violations by Hamas — including the ceremonies that demean our hostages’ dignity and the cynical use of our hostages for propaganda purposes — it has been decided to delay the release of terrorists planned for yesterday until the next release of hostages is guaranteed, and without the humiliating ceremonies,' read a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, which was released at 1 a.m. on Sunday. Notably, the sole non-Jewish captive freed on Saturday - Hisham a-Sayyid, a Bedouin Muslim-Israeli held by Hamas for more than a decade - was privately handed over to the Red Cross without a public ceremony. The Hamas terror group said in a statement that it transferred a-Sayyid without fanfare 'out of respect for his honor and the honor of Arab-Israelis.' According to Hebrew-language media reports, some 600 Palestinian prisoners had already been boarded onto buses at Ofer Prison Saturday when the announcement came that their release was indefinitely postponed. After waiting for hours on the buses, they were instructed to disembark and return to their cells. Beyond the ceremony held on Saturday, Israel's delay is likely influenced by the botched return of the Bibas' families bodies. On Thursday, Hamas claimed that it transferred the bodies of Shiri Bibas and her sons, Kfir and Ariel, to the Red Cross, along with the body of octogenarian hostage Oded Lifshitz. While DNA testing confirmed the identities of Lifshitz and the Bibas children, the remains of the adult woman were found to not be of Shiri Bibas. Late Friday evening, Hamas returned Shiri Bibas' body. Forensic analysis determined that the Bibas family were brutally murdered by their terrorist captors. Defense Minister Israel Katz said that their murders will 'not be taken lightly.'

Forensic evidence confirms Shiri Bibas not killed by IDF airstrik...	Our examination found no injuries consistent with a bombing,' says IDF. By JNS A forensic analysis of Shiri Bibas’s body found no evidence linking her death to an Israeli airstrike, contrary to claims made by Hamas. Her corpse was positively identified by Dr. Chen Kugel, director of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Abu Kabir) in Tel Aviv. 'We identified Shiri Bibas two days after confirming the identities of her two young children, Kfir and Ariel,' Kugel stated on Saturday. 'Our examination found no injuries consistent with a bombing.' Hamas had long alleged that Bibas and her children were killed in an IDF airstrike in Gaza. However, the forensic findings directly contradict that narrative. 'We were met with depths of evil and malice that could not be conceived,' added Kugel. On Thursday, Hamas returned the bodies of Shiri’s children, Kfir and Ariel, along with that of octogenarian Oded Lifshitz. However, the fourth body freed from Gaza, which Hamas said was that of Shiri Bibis, was found to belong to an unidentified woman. Shiri Bibas’s remains were returned to Israel from Gaza on Friday night. Hamas transferred her body to the Red Cross, which then handed it over to the IDF. The military brought her remains to the National Institute of Forensic Medicine for definitive identification and examination. 'This is a difficult day for us and for all citizens of Israel,' Kugel concluded. Forensic analysis of Kfir and Ariel also showed that they were murdered in cold blood by their Gaza captors. The IDF said that the Palestinian terrorists committed the crime 'with their bare hands' weeks after being taken captive on Oct. 7, 2023. On Oct. 7, 2023, Gazan terrorists stormed Kibbutz Nir Oz. They breached the Bibas family home’s door using a drill and other equipment and entered the safe room where the four were hiding. Father Yarden reported the attack to his wider family in real-time, texting that 'it feels like the end.' The video of Shiri’s kidnapping—terrified and trying to protect her two children with her arms as she was surrounded by masked men with weapons—became a symbol of the Oct. 7 massacre. Shiri’s parents, Yossi and Margit Silberman, were murdered that day. Yarden Bibas was freed on Feb. 1 after 484 days in Hamas captivity. According to the Israeli government, 63 hostages are remaining in Gaza, with 36 classified as deceased and 27 alive. Another four bodies are slated for release this coming Thursday.

Who are the 4 deceased hostages being released Thursday?	The bodies of Ohad Yahalomi, Tsahi Idan, Itzik Elgarat, and Shlomo Mantzur are expected to return to Israel this Thursday. By World Israel News Staff The bodies of four deceased Israeli hostages are expected to be returned to Israel this Thursday, marking the final exchange of the first phase of the ongoing hostage deal. Ohad Yahalomi, 49, Tsahi Idan, 49, Itzik Elgarat, 68, and Shlomo Mantzur, 85, were all kidnapped from their homes in southern Israel on October 7th, 2023. While all of the men are now believed to be dead, at least two of them are believed to have been abducted alive. Yahalomi engaged in a gun battle with Hamas terrorists, sitting outside of his home's safe room in Kibbutz Nir Oz, in order to protect his family. He was shot in the leg by terrorists. His wife and two of his children were able to escape, while his 12-year-old son, Eitan, was captured by terrorists. Eitan Yahalomi was released in a December 2023 hostage deal, but his father remained in the Strip. The Yahalomi family has insisted that the wounds Ohad sustained were survivable. Idan was not injured during his abduction from Kibbutz Nahal Oz, indicating that he was murdered in captivity. According to eyewitness testimony from Idan's wife, the father-of-three was kidnapped alive. Terrorists had stormed their home, firing through their safe room door and killing 18-year-old Ma'ayan Idan, who died in her father's arms. Gali Idan managed to protect her other two children, but the terrorists abducted her husband. Elgarat, who holds both Israeli and Danish citizenship, had called his brother from the safe room of his home on October 7th. Danny Elgarat told Hebrew-language media that Itzik was 'hysterical' and had been wounded in the arm by gunfire. The last thing he told his brother was 'this is the end.' Mantzur immigrated from Iraq to Israel as a teenager. He was married to his wife Mazel, who escaped the onslaught physically unharmed, for more than 60 years. The IDF recently said that Mantzur was murdered by terrorists on October 7th at his home in Kibbutz Kissufim, and that his body was abducted to the Gaza Strip. Mantzur's family had previously believed that he was kidnapped alive and had hoped for his safe return.

Freed hostage threatened Hamas captor who sexually abused her	Karina Ariev reportedly told outgoing IDF Chief of Staff that she was severely beaten, strangled during abduction to Gaza. By World Israel News Staff A female observation soldier who was kidnapped from her army base by Hamas terrorists and held in the Gaza Strip for 13 months revealed that she was sexually harassed by one of her captors, according to a Saturday evening report from Channel 12 News. Karina Ariev, 20, was abducted from Nahal Oz alongside Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, Liri Albag, and Naama Levy. Nearly all of the other soldiers on the base were killed in the Hamas onslaught. The five women were freed in late January and early February, during phase one of the ongoing ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. While Ariev has not yet spoken directly to the media, Channel 12 News reported new details about October 7th and her time in captivity. The report is based on a conversation that Ariev had with outgoing Chief of Staff Herzi HaLevi. One of the terrorists repeatedly sexually harassed Ariev, though details about his behavior were not included in the report. Ariev said she threatened to tell his commander about his actions, and the harassment stopped, according to Channel 12 News. The Jerusalem-born soldier said she had initially played dead during the Hamas invasion of the base, hiding amid a pile of dead bodies. Meanwhile, terrorists fired additional shots into dead soldiers' bodies, in order to confirm they had killed them. A terrorist noticed that Ariev was still alive and pulled her aside. If he hadn't seen her breathing, Ariev likely would have been shot multiple times. On the way to Gaza, Ariev was severely beaten and strangled nearly to the point of unconsciousness by her abductors. They also stole her jewelry and ripped hair out of her head. At one point Ariev was forced to lie on the hot hood of the terrorists' vehicle, which caused burns to her body. Once in captivity, Ariev endured psychological torture, including threats and insults from the terrorists guarding her.

‘Entering strongholds of terrorism,’ Netanyahu says in Tulkarem	Netanyahu on Thursday ordered the military to conduct a 'massive' counter-terrorism operation in Judea and Samaria following the failed bus bombings in Tel Aviv. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a visit to the Tulkarem refugee camp in Samaria on Friday—hours after explosions on several buses in the Tel Aviv area that are being investigated as a coordinated terror attack—that Israeli troops 'are doing a tremendous job.' 'In the past year, we have greatly increased our activity. We are entering the strongholds of terrorism, leveling entire streets used by terrorists and their homes, as well as eliminating terrorists and commanders,' Netanyahu said, per an English translation his office provided. 'We are taking extremely important measures against Hamas and other terrorist entities who are attempting to harm us.' The Israeli premier called the events of Thursday night 'an attempt to perpetrate a series of terrorist attacks with mass casualties' that 'is a very severe situation.' In response, he said, Israel is launching 'additional operations against hotbeds of terrorism.' 'I know that our heroic soldiers know how to do this job well,' Netanyahu said. Netanyahu on Thursday ordered the military to conduct a 'massive' counter-terrorism operation in Judea and Samaria and instructed the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and Israel Police to step up 'preventive activities' against possible additional attacks across the country. Following a situational assessment on Thursday, the IDF said its operations in Judea and Samaria were ongoing and announced the deployment of three additional battalions to reinforce security in the territories. All of the explosions on Thursday occurred in parked, empty buses across the central cities of Bat Yam and Holon, located south of Tel Aviv. There were no injuries in the attack. At least one of the bombs bore a note, in Arabic and Hebrew, that stated, 'Revenge from the Tulkarem refugee camp,' Channel 12 News reported. Five explosive devices, all with timers set to go off simultaneously, were found in what was intended to be a 'strategic terrorist attack,' Channel 12 cited security sources as saying. On Friday, Defense Minister Israel Katz toured the Tulkarem camp, where he vowed to vanquish the terrorists. 'We are at war with extremist Islamic terror and we will win—here, in Gaza and everywhere,' he said. The IDF said on Friday that troops detained some 90 terror suspects in Judea and Samaria over the past week. The military has been conducting an offensive in Samaria, dubbed 'Operation Iron Wall,' since January 21.

Trump: Israel’s decision on Gaza ‘rough,’ fine with war or truce	The president was also asked about his resettlement plan for Palestinians in Gaza in places like Egypt and Jordan, to which he replied that he is not going to force the issue. By JNS It is for Israel to decide whether to resume the war in Gaza or continue into the second round of talks with Hamas to free more hostages, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday. Asked by Brian Kilmeade on Fox News whether he was 'okay either way,' Trump answered, 'I am.' Hamas is 'so violent and vicious,' the president continued, 'it’s a decision that has to be made; it’s a rough decision. One group [of hostages] came in so bad, it looked like [they came out of] a concentration camp in Germany,' Trump said in reference to Eli Sharabi, Or Levy, and Ohad Ben Ami, the three Israeli men who were freed from Gazan captivity on Feb. 8 in emaciated and frail condition. Trump went on to say that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'actually not torn. I mean, you know where he stands, and he would like to go in, and he’s just so angry, and he should be. If he’s not angry, then there’d be something wrong with him, frankly. He is very angry; he’s a very angry man at what happened, especially what happened yesterday with these kids …, they were babies,' the president said, referring to the return of the bodies of children Ariel and Kfir Bibas who were kidnapped into Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. 'It looked like [the Gazans] were celebrating as they were bringing the bodies back. You know, to see it is not even believable. … when you see what’s happening … It’s so barbaric. You wouldn’t think that would happen in the modern age, but it happened,' Trump added. The president was also asked about his resettlement plan for Palestinians in Gaza in places like Egypt and Jordan, to which he replied that he is not going to force the issue. 'Well, we pay Jordan and Egypt billions of dollars a year and I was a little surprised they [rejected the proposal], but they did. And I’ll tell you, the way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works,' Trump said. 'But I’m not forcing it,' he added. 'I’m just gonna sit back and recommend it, and then the U.S. would own the site and there’d be no Hamas, and they’d be developed and then you’d start all over again with a clean plate,' the president said. Trump seemed to raise some doubt over his plan, saying that it 'depends on what happens over the next little while. … The question is, can you wipe [Hamas] all out, you know, they are so interspersed among people and it’s certainly not an easy thing to do. 'But I liked my plan; I thought my plan was good. You get them out, you move them, you build a beautiful community and a permanent community, and you then take the Gaza Strip,' Trump said. 'We’ll see what happens. It’s a great location. I don’t know why Israel ever gave that up [in the 2005 disengagement]. … It’s one of the bad real estate deals.' On Tuesday, Israel’s Channel 12 News reported that Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer will head negotiations for the second phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. Mossad chief David Barnea led previous rounds. The Israeli outlet reported earlier this month that Barnea would still engage with Qatari and Egyptian mediators under Dermer’s guidance. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told reporters on Tuesday that Jerusalem had decided to start talks on Phase 2 of the agreement. Terrorists in Gaza still holding 63 hostages, 36 of whom have been confirmed dead.

IDF: Hamas murdered Ariel and Kfir Bibas with their bare hands	Hamas then mutilated their bodies to support the claim that they were killed in an air strike and conceal the despicable crime. By Kostis Konstantinou, TPS Ariel and Kfir Bibas, the two toddlers abducted by Hamas terrorists on October 7 were not killed by an Israeli air strike. They were murdered in a brutal manner, according to a televised statement delivered by IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari today. Citing forensic evidence from the children’s remains combined with intelligence reports, Hagari said that the captors of Ariel and Kfir (aged 4 years and 10 months respectively at the time of their abduction) 'brutally murdered them with their bare hands'. He added that they then mutilated their bodies to support the claim that they were killed in an air strike and conceal the despicable crime, treating two helpless infants 'the way ISIS' has done in the past. Hagari added that the IDF has shared this intelligence with international partners. The IDF Spokesperson also disclosed that he spoke with the children’s father, the only surviving member of the Bibas family. 'Yarden wants the whole world to know the brutal manner in which his children were murdered,' he explained.

Israel redeems six hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza	Hamas is slated to return four additional bodies to Israel next Thursday, in what would be the final exchange of Phase 1 of the ceasefire agreement that took effect on Jan. 19 and is due to end on March 1. By Charles Bybelezer, JNS Israel on Saturday redeemed six living hostages from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip: Eliya Cohen, 27, Avera Mengistu, 39, Hisham al-Sayed, 36, Omer Shem Tov, 22, Tal Shoham, 40, and Omer Wenkert, 23. Cohen, Shem Tov, Shoham and Wenkert were all abducted during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, while Mengistu and al-Sayed suffer from mental illness and crossed into the Strip over a decade ago. Hamas released Mengistu and Shoham during a propaganda ceremony in southern Gaza’s Rafah, while Cohen, Shem Tov and Wenkert were freed in a similar exchange in Nuseirat in the Palestinian enclave’s center. Al-Sayed was handed over in Gaza City. Shoham’s family released a statement hailing the 'unforgettable moment,' while urging the government to do everything in its power to bring home the remaining captives. 'We thank all the people of Israel who stood with us through all the long days of pain and suffering. During these days, we need privacy for Tal, Adi, and the children,' said the statement. 'At this crucial moment in our lives, our only request is to seize this window of opportunity to secure a deal that will bring fathers back to their children—children need their fathers—and return all hostages home: the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for eternal rest.' Added Mengistu’s relatives: 'Our family has endured 10 years and five months of unimaginable suffering. During this time, there have been continuous efforts to secure his return, with prayers and pleas, some silent, that remained unanswered until today. … We ask that these moments be respected, and that we be granted the peace and rest we so desperately need.' The hostages were all handed over to Red Cross representatives and driven to meetings point in Gaza, where they were transferred to Israeli special forces. The captives were then taken back to Israel, where they underwent a preliminary physical and psychological examination at an army facility near Kibbutz Re’im, located close to the border, and to meet with their families. 'The commanders and soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces salute and embrace the returning hostages as they make their way home to the State of Israel,' said the military in a statement. Cohen’s family said in a statement on Saturday, 'We are overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude for Eliya’s return home after 505 long and torturous days in captivity. … 'We want to thank the IDF soldiers, the fighters, the Hostages Families Forum, our family liaison officer Amit, and especially all citizens of Israel for their embrace, support, and unwavering faith. Many prayers were answered today, and we thank everyone who accompanied us on this long journey,' added the statement. Shem Tov’s family noted he survived captivity despite suffering from celiac disease and has become 'a child of the entire State of Israel' since the Oct. 7 invasion and massacre. 'We still don’t know everything—the horror stories will only be revealed with time. But now, we can hug him again,' the family said in a statement. 'Thank you to the Creator, to the people of Israel for their prayers, strength and love. Thank you to the soldiers who sacrificed for this moment, to everyone involved in the negotiations and diplomatic efforts. Thank you to Omer’s family and friends, and ours, who never gave up and never lost hope,' it added. In exchange, Israel was set to release on Saturday 602 Palestinian terrorists, including 50 serving life sentences, 60 serving long terms and 47 re-arrested after the 2011 swap for captive IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. However, Israel informed Palestinian officials in Ramallah that the release would be postponed until 8 p.m. local time. 'Regarding the delay in the release of the terrorists—following the conclusion of [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s] security consultation, a decision will be made regarding next steps, and the completion of the return of hostages’ remains at this stage,' an unnamed Israeli source was quoted by Hebrew media as saying. Hamas is slated to return four additional bodies to Israel next Thursday, in what would be the final exchange of Phase 1 of the ceasefire agreement that took effect on Jan. 19 and is due to end on March 1. On Friday, Netanyahu eulogized the slain hostages returned the previous day—octogenarian Oded Lifshitz and children Kfir and Ariel Bibas—and vowed to bring home the boys’ mother, Shiri Bibas, from Gaza. 'The cruelty of the Hamas monsters knows no bounds. Not only did they kidnap the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two small babies. In an unspeakably cynical manner, they did not return Shiri to her little children, the little angels, and they put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin,' said Netanyahu in a video message to the nation. 'We will work resolutely to bring Shiri home together with all our abductees—both living and dead—and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement. The sacred memory of Oded Lipshitz and Ariel and Kfir Bibas will be forever enshrined in the heart of the nation. God will avenge their blood,' he continued. Overnight Friday, Hamas returned the body of Shiri Bibas, who was murdered in cold blood in captivity. Yarden Bibas was freed on Feb. 1 after 484 days in Hamas captivity. Terrorists in Gaza are still holding 63 hostages, 36 of whom have been confirmed dead. Below are short bios of the hostages freed on Saturday: • Eliya Cohen, 27, is a resident of Tzur Hadassah near Jerusalem and has three younger sisters.

Freed hostage Agam Berger found Rabbi Druckman’s book in Gaza, co...	The book, With Strength and With Spirit, which was distributed in Bnei Akiva yeshivas and girls' high schools, was accidentally left behind by an IDF soldier. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Freed hostage and IDF lookout Agam Berger discovered a book by Rabbi Haim Druckman in Gaza and consulted it on whether one can eat non-kosher meat in life-threatening situations. The book, which was distributed in Bnei Akiva yeshivas and girls' high schools, was accidentally left behind by an IDF soldier. Berger, who maintained Jewish observance during her captivity, said that upon reading the book, she learned that she was permitted to eat non-kosher meat if her life was in danger. Elhanan Glatt, CEO of the Bnei Akiva Yeshivot and Ulpanot Center, said, 'Rabbi Druckman, your efforts are rewarded, and they have returned from enemy territory. We aimed to instill the spirit and light of Rabbi Druckman in the soldiers just before the ground operation began.' Yaniv Sufan, director of the 'Hinenu' initiative continuing Rabbi Druckman’s legacy, said, 'It is deeply moving that the booklets from Rabbi Druckman, of blessed memory, reached the soldiers who needed them most—the lookouts.' 'There is no better representation of the booklet's title, With Strength and With Spirit,'than Agam’s spirit of greatness, which has become evident since her return.' Liri Albag reported that Agam Berger stayed true to her religious observance during her captivity, including keeping kosher and observing Shabbat. 'Despite the difficult conditions and limited food options, Agam chose to remain faithful to her values and her faith,' Liri said. Liri’s mother, Merav, shared that her daughter refused to eat any non-kosher food offered to her during captivity, despite the severe food shortages. Before her daughter’s release, Merav Berger requested that if Agam were released on Saturday, those involved, as well as the media, avoid violating Shabbat. 'I will wait for Agam, with G-d’s help, when she comes, with as little desecration of Shabbat as possible,' she said. 'I ask of you, those who embrace us and have journeyed with us, and who have the great merit of bringing our children home—please do not desecrate Shabbat.' In addition to Berger, other released hostages reported refusing leavened food during Passover and fasting on Yom Kippur, despite suffering severe malnutrition.

US envoy warns Hamas to release all hostages ‘or face total annih...	Boehler: 'It’s not just that you need to release her (Shiri Bibas's) body; you must free all of the remaining hostages.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US envoy for hostages Adam Boehler had harsh words for Hamas after they returned an anonymous corpse to Israel instead of the body of Shiri Bibas. Boehler described Hamas’s action as 'a clear violation' and offered this piece of advice: 'It’s not just that you need to release her body; you must free all of the remaining hostages.' He pointed out that Hamas is still holding Idan Alexander, an Israeli-American, and stated, 'Idan needs to come home.' 'If I were them, I’d release everyone, or they will face total annihilation,' he added. On Thursday, Hamas held a ceremony for cheering crowds in Gaza, claiming the bodies in the coffins belonged to hostages Kfir Bibas, Ariel Bibas, Shiri Bibas, and Oded Lifshitz. However, upon examination by a forensics team, it was revealed that the body they said was Shiri Bibas’s was actually that of an anonymous woman, not a hostage. Additionally, Hamas falsely claimed that the Bibas family members were killed by Israeli airstrikes. Forensic experts determined that the Bibas children had been murdered. Yarden Bibas, their father, was released from Hamas captivity last week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences in a Hebrew-language video statement: 'The State of Israel bows its head over the loss of two small children, tender infants, brothers—Ariel and Kfir Bibas, may their memory be a blessing—and over Oded Lifshitz, may his memory be a blessing, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz.' 'All three were brutally murdered in Hamas captivity during the first weeks of the war. The cruelty of Hamas knows no bounds.' Netanyahu continued, 'Not only did they abduct the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two little babies, but in an act of unimaginable cynicism, they did not return Shiri to her small children. Instead, they placed the body of a Gazan woman in the coffin.' He pledged that Hamas would pay 'the full price' for violating the ceasefire and hostage deal with Israel. 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home, along with all our captives—both the living and the fallen—and we will ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and vicious breach of the agreement.'

Israel accuses Turkey of helping Iran funnel funds to Hezbollah	Israel’s Channel 14 reported on Tuesday that it is believed that tens of millions of dollars have already reached Hezbollah through Turkey. By JNS Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on Monday accused Turkey of assisting Iran in funneling funds to Hezbollah in Lebanon. During a meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem with a bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators, which included seven senators and Deputy Middle East Special Envoy Morgan Ortagus, Sa’ar warned that Iran has intensified its efforts to finance Hezbollah, with the active involvement of Turkey. 'There is an increased Iranian effort to smuggle money to Lebanon for Hezbollah in order to restore its power and status, including via Turkey and through its cooperation,' said Sa’ar.

A senior political source told Channel 14 reporter Tamir Morag: 'Turkey sees itself as the leader of the Sunni world, and as such, it plays a ‘big players’ game against Shi’ite Iran.

RFK Jr. orders sweeping review of vaccines and antidepressants	Kennedy listed several other things as possible causes of chronic diseases such as radiation from electronic devices, farming chemicals, processed foods, food allergies, tiny plastic particles in the environment, and chemicals used to make non-stick pans. By Jewish Breaking News A month ago, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sat before a Senate hearing committee and declared, 'I support vaccines. I support the vaccine schedule. I support good science.' But this week, Kennedy struck a markedly different tone. His first act as Health Secretary was to announce an investigation whether childhood vaccinations might be linked to chronic diseases. 'We will convene representatives of all viewpoints to study the causes for the drastic rise in chronic disease,' Kennedy told the assembled workers at HHS headquarters on Tuesday. 'Some of the possible factors we will investigate were formerly taboo or insufficiently scrutinized.' Kennedy made it clear he planned to redirect the agency’s vast resources toward questioning long-established medical consensus, noting that 'nothing is going to be off limits.' His investigation plans go beyond just vaccines and antidepressants. Kennedy listed several other things as possible causes of chronic diseases such as radiation from electronic devices, farming chemicals, processed foods, food allergies, tiny plastic particles in the environment, and chemicals used to make non-stick pans. 'Whatever belief or suspicion I have expressed in the past, I’m willing to subject them all to the scrutiny of unbiased science,' he said. 'That is going to be our template — unbiased science. That’s something that will make us all proud of this agency and of our role in restoring American health.' However, public health experts warn there’s a big difference between studying new environmental threats and re-examining vaccines that we already know are safe. 'It’s very disturbing that someone who has spent so much of his career trying to undermine confidence in vaccines, trying to tear down the infrastructure that approves and recommends vaccines, has the potential to be in a position of power over the infrastructure that has those goals,' infectious disease specialist Adam Ratner tells NPR. 'It is much easier to scare people than to unscare them,' he says. 'And I think that just by elevating anti-vaccine views in the guise of RFK, I think that we risk a crisis in vaccine confidence in the U.S.' The post RFK Jr. orders sweeping review of vaccines and antidepressants appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/rfk-jr-orders-sweeping-review-of-vaccines-and-antidepressants/	2025-02-21T02:59:24-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25028838083237.jpg
IAF strikes Hezbollah smuggling routes on Lebanon-Syria border	Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday vowed to continue to act against Hezbollah 'at full strength.' By JNS The Israeli Air Force overnight Thursday attacked crossing points in the area of the Lebanon-Syria border used by Hezbollah to smuggle weapons into the Land of the Cedars. The military noted that the Iranian-backed terrorist group’s attempt to rearm constitutes a blatant violation of ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. 'The IDF continues to operate to remove any threat to the State of Israel and will operate to prevent any attempt by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to rebuild its forces,' the military said.

The incident came a day after the deadline for a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory, under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Jerusalem and Beirut that went into effect on Nov. 27. On Monday, the IDF confirmed that troops would remain deployed at five strategic outposts in Southern Lebanon because the Lebanese Armed Forces have not fully deployed in the area in place of Hezbollah, as required by the terms of the truce. Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday vowed to continue to act against Hezbollah 'at full strength.'

‘Hamas will pay the full price’ for murdering Bibas family, withh...	After forensic examinations reveal that the two youngest hostages abducted on October 7th were murdered in captivity, and that Hamas violated deal by withholding mother's remains, Netanyahu vows terror group 'will pay the full price.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu castigated Hamas Friday morning, and warned that Israel would 'seek justice' against the terror organization, after Israeli forensics examiners found that two small children taken hostage were murdered. 'The State of Israel bows its head over the loss of two small children, tender infants, brothers—Ariel and Kfir Bibas, may their memory be a blessing, and over Oded Lifshitz, may his memory be a blessing, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz,' Netanyahu said in a Hebrew-language video statement. 'All three were brutally murdered in Hamas captivity during the first weeks of the war. The cruelty of the Hamas monsters knows no bounds.' Netanyahu ripped Hamas not only for the murders of the Bibas children - both of whom were, according to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute, murdered in November 2023 - but also for using their bodies in a propaganda display in Gaza on Thursday. The premier also lambasted the terror group for refusing to return the body of the boys' mother, Shiri Bibas. Hamas claimed it handed over Shiri's remains on Thursday, but examiners at Abu Kabir determined that the body was not that of Mrs. Bibas. 'Not only did they abduct the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two little babies, but in an act of unimaginable cynicism, they did not return Shiri to her small children, these little angels, and instead placed the body of a Gazan woman in the coffin.' Netanyahu pledged that Hamas would pay 'the full price' for violating the ceasefire and hostage deal with Israel. 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home, along with all our captives—both the living and the fallen—and we will ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and vicious breach of the agreement.' 'May the sacred memory of Oded Lifshitz, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas be forever enshrined in the heart of the nation. May God avenge their blood. And we, too, will seek justice.' Shiri's husband, Yarden, the father of Kfir and Ariel, was released on February 1st, as part of the ceasefire deal. Israel contends that the substitution of another body for the remains of Shiri Bibas constitutes a violation of the hostage deal. On Friday, Hamas issued a statement admitting that it had not returned Mrs. Bibas' remains. The terror group claimed that Shiri Bibas was killed in an IDF airstrike - despite forensic evidence from the Bibas children that they were not killed as a result of an airstrike. 'Shiri Bibas' remains apparently became mixed with the remains of other dead under the rubble, after the IAF struck the place where she was staying,' Hamas claimed.

Beirut shuts down for Hezbollah leader’s funeral	Safieddine, who was designated to succeed Nasrallah before being eliminated by Israel, will be buried separately on Monday in his southern hometown of Deir Qanun al-Nahr. By Jewish Breaking News Hezbollah is pulling out all the stops for Sunday’s funeral of its eliminated leader Hassan Nasrallah and his deputy Hashem Safieddine, implementing extraordinary security measures and shutting down much of Beirut for the ceremony. According to AFP, Beirut’s airport will completely shut down from noon until 4:00 PM, with all flights suspended during the ceremony scheduled for 1:00 PM local time at Camille Chamoun sports stadium. After Israel bombed his underground bunker in September, Nasrallah was temporarily buried in an undisclosed location out of fear that Israel might target a large funeral gathering. Now, with an extended ceasefire in place, Hezbollah will be welcoming terrorists from around the world. Iran has promised 'high-level' participation but has notably avoided specifying which officials will attend. Iraqi Airways and Lebanon’s Middle East Airlines have increased flights from Baghdad as representatives of Iraq’s main pro-Iran terrorist factions also prepare to attend. The procession will then move from the stadium to Nasrallah’s burial site near the airport, now lined with Hezbollah flags and images of fallen terror commanders. Safieddine, who was designated to succeed Nasrallah before being eliminated by Israel, will be buried separately on Monday in his southern hometown of Deir Qanun al-Nahr. Hezbollah’s elaborate funeral comes as the Iranian-backed terror group grapples with mounting losses, including hundreds of fighters and senior commanders killed since it joined Hamas’s war against Israel in October 2023. Perhaps their worst day came on September 17 and 18 when 1,500 terrorists were taken out of commission when the Mossad detonated an unspecified number of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies. document.createElement('video'); The post Beirut shuts down for Hezbollah leader’s funeral appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/beirut-shuts-down-for-hezbollah-leaders-funeral/	2025-02-21T01:32:52-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/shutterstock_2342698091-scaled.jpg
Netanyahu orders ‘massive’ counter-terror op after bus bombings	All of the explosions on Thursday occurred in parked, empty buses across the central city of Bat Yam, located just south of Tel Aviv. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday night ordered the military to conduct a 'massive' counter-terrorism operation in Judea and Samaria, after three buses exploded near Tel Aviv and bombs were found on two others in what is being investigated as a coordinated attack. Netanyahu also instructed the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and Israel Police to step up 'preventive activities' against possible additional attacks across the country. Following a situational assessment on Thursday, the IDF said its operations in Judea and Samaria were ongoing, and that areas within the territories have been closed off. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi instructed forces to assist the Israel Police as necessary. The military also announced the deployment of three additional battalions to reinforce security in Judea and Samaria, adding that it was 'prepared to expand the offensive operations.' An investigator examines a bombed bus in Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv, Feb. 20, 2025. Credit: Flash90. All of the explosions on Thursday occurred in parked, empty buses across the central city of Bat Yam, located just south of Tel Aviv. There were no injuries in the attack. At least one of the bombs bore a note, in Arabic and Hebrew, that stated, 'Revenge from the Tulkarem refugee camp,' a reference to the terrorist hotbed in Samaria where security forces have been conducting operations, Channel 12 News reported. Five explosive devices, all with timers set to go off simultaneously, were found in what was intended to be a 'strategic terrorist attack,' Channel 12 cited security sources as saying. The Shin Bet was called to the scenes, and all bus drivers in the Tel Aviv metropolitan were instructed to search their vehicles for bombs. Miri Regev, the Israeli transport minister, instructed the National Public Transport Authority to 'stop and inspect all buses, trains and light rail cars and act in accordance with the instructions of the Shin Bet and the police.' Defense Minister Israel Katz directed the IDF to increase 'the intensity of activities to thwart terrorism in the Tulkarm refugee camp and in the refugee camps in Judea and Samaria in general,' following what he called 'attempted serious terrorist attacks. 'We will pursue the terrorists to the bitter end and destroy the terrorist infrastructure in the camps that serve as a frontline for the Iranian axis of evil,' Katz said.

American conservatives vote to back Israeli sovereignty over Jude...	‘Akin to the Balfour Declaration’ - Conservative Political Action Conference, America’s largest annual gathering of political conservatives, votes to endorse Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff American conservative activists voted this week to endorse the application of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, amid speculation the Netanyahu government may move forward with a long-shelved plan to place Israeli towns in the disputed area under Israeli law. On Wednesday night, the American Conservative Union kicked off its annual gathering, the Conservative Political Action Conference, in Oxon Hill, Maryland, outside of Washington D.C. According to multiple reports in the Israeli media Thursday night, during the conference, activists voted to back a resolution calling for the extension of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. The resolution was drafted following talks between senior CPAC officials and settlement enterprise leaders, including Israel Ganz, mayor of the Binyamin Regional Council and chairman of the Yesha Council, the umbrella group representing Israeli municipalities in Judea and Samaria, Israel National News reported. The Yesha Council was represented at the conference by the organization’s CEO, Omer Rahamim. The 'CPAC resolution,' Rahamim told The Jerusalem Post, 'carries considerable weight with respect to American support for the extension of Israeli sovereignty to Judea and Samaria.' The Israeli government also sent an envoy to the conference, with Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli (Likud) attending. On Thursday, former Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland read the text of the CPAC resolution. 'We believe all these areas are integral parts of Israel, and the United States of America and her allies should recognize Israeli sovereignty over these lands,' the resolution states regarding Judea and Samaria. In response, Ganz hailed the resolution as a second 'Balfour Declaration,' referring to the 1917 letter by British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, later adopted by the British government as its official policy, backing the formation of a Jewish national homeland in the historic Land of Israel. 'Your declaration is akin to the Balfour Declaration,' Ganz said. 'You are granting political validity to biblical values and to justice. This is a tremendous blessing for Israel, the U.S, and the entire free world.' 'The extension of sovereignty will launch a new era based on the historic truth that the Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people and the Jewish state. These days are proof of the depth of the partnership between our countries, both in the processes currently underway, and in the promise for Israel’s hold on Judea and Samaria. The declaration today clarifies the importance of changing the security reality in all the arenas – the north, the south and in Judea and Samaria, to ensure the security of the State of Israel.'

Shiri Bibas still held in Gaza, Bibas children murdered in captiv...	In a chilling display, Hamas paraded the children's bodies in coffins before handing them over to the Red Cross for transfer to Israel. By Joseph Lichtenstadter, World Israel News The IDF has confirmed that the body returned by Hamas is not that of Shiri Bibas, deepening the anguish surrounding the fate of her family. Reports initially suggested that the hostages being transferred were Kfir and Ariel Bibas—the baby and toddler sons of Shiri Bibas—along with a 84-year-old grandfather, Oded Lifshitz. While the IDF has verified the identities of the two children and the elderly Oded, the fourth body remains unidentified. Tragically, the IDF has also confirmed that Hamas terrorists murdered the Bibas brothers after abducting them from their cribs in Nir Oz during the October 7th massacre. In a chilling display, Hamas paraded the children's bodies in coffins before handing them over to the Red Cross for transfer to Israel. The grim stage was adorned with a poster featuring images of the hostages, alongside a grotesque depiction of Prime Minister Netanyahu as a vampire. The coffins were even marked with a 'date of arrest,' as if to erase the innocence of the victims—a young mother, her defenseless children, and an elderly man. As Israel reels from this devastating development, the uncertainty surrounding Shiri Bibas’s fate casts an even darker shadow over the already unbearable grief. The IDF is still assessing the situation, and further updates are expected.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Iris Haim, mother of Yotam Haim, who was mistakenly shot by the IDF after fleeing his captors, compared the deceased Bibas children to her son. 'The red-haired children are similar to Yotam. He was a red-haired child, exactly like them, on Kibbutz Gvulot,' she said in an interview with Channel 14. 'Orange is the color of love, the orange-gold hair of the three hostages – Ariel and Kfir Bibas and Yotam Haim,' she wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday. Kfir and Ariel Bibas, the red-haired children who, along with their mother Shiri, became symbolic of the hostage crisis, were returned in coffins to Israel along with the body of deceased hostage Oded Lifshitz. When Hamas released the names of the four dead hostages, relatives of the Bibas family said they had been holding out hope until the names were confirmed and criticized the press for prematurely eulogizing the Bibas family before Israel had confirmed they had been killed. Haim said, 'Yesterday, the names were published despite the family’s request not to do so. Until yesterday, I had hoped for the Bibas family.' Speaking as a mother who lost a son hostage in Gaza, Haim said, 'You don’t realize it until you see the body, and then you understand. Because I understand the family so well, I would ask that, until the last moment, no one speak about it.' 'This is a major tragedy for the country. People were devastated because they understood that these situations are becoming more complicated&#8230; Now hostages may return, alive or dead.' Haim said the tragedy provides a kind of clarity about 'how much we care for, love, and support each other.'

By World Israel News and JNS Israeli security agencies are investigating three explosions that occurred in parked buses across the central Israeli city of Bat Yam on Thursday night as suspected terrorist attacks. According to reports, the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) was called to the scenes, and bus drivers in the Tel Aviv area have been instructed to search their vehicles for possible explosives. In addition, operations of the Tel Aviv light rail has been grounded, Channel 12 News reported. Israel Police said that multiple explosive devices weighing approximately 5 kilograms each were placed into buses, intending to explode Friday morning, possibly killing hundreds of civilians. There were no injuries as a result of the blasts, the Israel Police stated. Bat Yam Mayor Zvika Brot told local media, 'The incident began at two locations just minutes apart. Two bombs were detonated on two buses that were empty.' He added that while there were no casualties in the suspected terror attacks, 'there are suspicions of an additional bomb.' Shortly after Brot issued his statement, Israeli media outlets aired video footage of what was said to be a third bus explosion in the Bat Yam area.

Under international law, any handover of the remains of the deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk criticized Hamas for the ceremony it held during the release of the bodies of four hostages. 'Under international law, any handover of the remains of the deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families,' the rights chief said in a statement. The captives included 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, 33-year-old Shiri Bibas, and her two sons – the youngest Israelis taken hostage by Gazan terrorists on October 7th – Ariel and Kfir. At an event held by Hamas in the Bani Suheila neighborhood of the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis on Thursday morning, a large crowd cheered as Hamas arrived carrying four black coffins in separate cars. 'As the bodies of four Israeli hostages are transferred by Hamas to the Red Cross, hundreds of ‘innocent Gazans’ dance to music and happily film this tragic event,' Israel’s Government Press Office wrote on X. 'We are at a loss for words to describe how this makes us feel.' Half an hour later, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office announced that the coffins carrying the four slain hostages had been handed over to the IDF. 'Israel has received, through the Red Cross, the coffins of four fallen hostages,' the PMO stated. During the transfer of the bodies, a heated exchange took place between Red Cross officials and Hamas terrorists over the ceremony and the manner in which the transfer was handled. Israel also protested to the mediators and filed a complaint with the Red Cross about the 'ceremony.' 'The pain is indescribable. Our hearts, those of the entire nation, are shattered,' President Isaac Herzog said. 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I lower my head and seek forgiveness. Forgiveness for failing to protect you on that tragic day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely. May their memory be a blessing.'

Hamas official says at least 2.3 million people alive in Gaza, un...	Furthermore, Naim denied that the ongoing war is between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group, asserting that the entirety of the Palestinian people is fighting against Israel. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner During an interview with anti-Israel social media personality Jackson Hinkle, a Hamas leader claimed that over 2 million people are still alive in the Gaza Strip, undercutting the notion that a so-called 'genocide' has taken place in the war-torn enclave. Citing recent comments made by US President Donald Trump that roughly 1.7 million people remain in Gaza, Hinkle asked interview guest Basem Naim, a Hamas official and former Gaza Minister of Health, whether he believed that far more people had died in the enclave than originally thought. Naim immediately dismissed the claim, clarifying that over 2 million Palestinians in Gaza are still alive. 'Donald Trump has come out a few times and he says the population in Gaza is 1.7 to 1.8 million. Of course, before [Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel] the population was much more than that, 400,000 to 500,000. Do you think his statistics are accurate, and if so, where did all those people go? Because we see the Ministry of Health in Gaza, they say the [Palestinian] death toll registered officially is over 40,000 [during the Israel-Hamas war],' Hinkle asked. 'I have no idea about his intentions to mention this number. But officially, there are 2.3 million-plus Palestinians are in the Gaza Strip,' Naim said. The senior Hamas official added that around 200,000 Palestinians have fled the Gaza Strip to other areas for safety reasons both before and after the current war. He claimed that many Palestinians left for academic or professional reasons. The terrorist official said that he believes around 50,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel’s defensive military operations following the Oct. 7 attack and that around 10,000 are missing. Furthermore, Naim denied that the ongoing war is between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group, asserting that the entirety of the Palestinian people is fighting against Israel. 'First of all, this confrontation is not between Hamas and Israel, because this has been said all the time in Western media. It is between Palestinians and Israel. Maybe this time, it is led by Hamas,' he said. Naim stated that Hamas’s 'armed resistance' is a tool the group uses to achieve its 'political goals' of destroying Israel and creating a Palestinian state in its place. He added that the Oct. 7 attacks — in which roughly 1200 people were killed in southern Israel and 250 were abducted as hostages — were a justified response to Israeli aggression. He denied that the brutal and unprovoked slaughter of Israeli civilians was 'initiated from our side.' Hinkle has an extensive history of spreading unsubstantiated and false claims about Israel. Like many anti-Israel critics, he has repeatedly asserted that the Jewish state has committed a 'genocide' in Gaza as revenge for Oct. 7. However, Hinkle has gone further than other anti-Israel commentators, oftentimes lauding the Hamas terrorist group as a 'resistance' organization and celebrating Iran’s April 2024 missile attacks against the Jewish state. Hinkle has referred to the anti-Israel outrage following Oct. 7 as a personal 'godsend,' which allowed his X/Twitter follower count balloon from roughly 400,000 to over 2.3 million in the span of a few months. 'DROP A LIKE if you stand with IRAN in the face of ISRAELI TERRORISM!' Hinkle posted on X/Twitter in April 2024. Beyond his support for Hamas, Hinkle has praised the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has defended the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Israel bans entry for those denying October 7 massacre or working...	If enacted, the law would criminalize collaboration with the ICC, making it illegal for Israeli citizens, authorities, and public entities to provide services or resources to the court. By Pesach Benson, TPS As Israelis prepared to receive the bodies of four hostages, the Israeli Knesset on Wednesday passed legislation barring non-citizens from entering or residing in the country if they or their affiliated organizations deny the October 7 massacre or the Holocaust, or if they support international prosecution of Israeli security personnel. The legislation, which was approved without opposition, builds on a 2017 amendment that barred providing visas and travel permits to individuals or organizations advocating boycotts of Israel. Proposed by Michel Buskila of the New Hope-United Right party and originally initiated by New Hope MK Zeev Elkin, the law aims to strengthen Israel’s ability to counteract what it described as 'hostile elements' who 'seek to harm the state.' According to the bill’s explanatory notes, existing legal measures were insufficient. The Knesset also advanced another bill targeting cooperation with the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. That proposal, submitted by Likud MK Amit Halevi, passed its preliminary reading with 25 votes in favor and 10 against. If enacted, the law would criminalize collaboration with the ICC, making it illegal for Israeli citizens, authorities, and public entities to provide services or resources to the court. Individuals found guilty of doing so could face up to five years in prison. The bill also seeks to prevent ICC officials and affiliates from entering Israel, owning property, or conducting economic activities in the country without special authorization. Supporters argue that the ICC poses a significant threat to Israel’s sovereignty and security personnel, reinforcing Israel’s longstanding position that it does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction. The International Criminal Court issued unprecedented arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in November, the first time warrants have been issued against leaders from a democratic country. Both officials would be liable for arrest if they travel to countries that are party to the ICC. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Deif. Although he was killed in an airstrike in July, Hamas never confirmed Deif’s death. Israel is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction. The ICC charter prohibits the court from prosecuting nationals of countries with independent judiciaries. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 69 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

Israel to free 602 terrorists as part of ceasefire	Of the 602 terrorists to be released this week, 108 are expected to be deported to Egypt before being moved to other countries from there. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israel is set to commute the sentences of 602 imprisoned terrorists this week as part of the last two releases of the first phase of its ceasefire agreement with Hamas, Hebrew media reported on Thursday. In accordance with the deal, the bodies of four hostages were returned to the Jewish state on Thursday morning. The remains are said to be those of Shiri Bibas (32 when captured on Oct. 7, 2023) and her sons, Ariel (4 when taken) and Kfir (9 months old when taken), as well as of Oded Lifshitz (83 when taken). Six living hostages are scheduled to be released on Saturday. Of the prisoners to be released by Israel this week, 445—residents of the Gaza Strip who were arrested by Israeli forces after the Oct. 7 massacre—are set to be freed later on Thursday. The remaining 157 terrorists are to be released after the six hostages return to Israeli territory on Saturday. This figure includes 50 terrorists who were serving life sentences, 60 with long sentences and 47 who were released in a 2011 deal with Hamas and later rearrested. Of the 602 terrorists to be released this week, 108 are expected to be deported to Egypt before being moved to other countries from there. Among those scheduled for release is Khalil Jabarin, who murdered dual U.S.-Israeli citizen Ari Fuld at Judea’s Gush Etzion Junction in 2018. Another is Omar al-Zaban, a senior operative in Hamas’s 'military wing' serving 27 life sentences plus 25 years for his role in attacks that claimed the lives of at least 27 people. Bilal Abu-Ghanem is serving three life sentences for the 2015 murder of Haviv Haim, 78, Alon Govberg, 51, and Richard Lakin, 76, on bus 78 in Jerusalem’s Armon Hanatziv area. Also to be released is Nael Barghouti, convicted of murdering of Israeli bus driver Mordechai Yekuelin, 27, in January 1978. He was released in the 2011 Shalit deal but rearrested after once again engaging in terrorist activity. Abed el-Nasser Isa—widely considered to be a student of infamous Hamas bomb-maker Yahya Ayyash—is also to be released. In the current first phase of the truce, Hamas has agreed to free 33 hostages, while Israel agreed to commute the sentences of some 2,000 terrorists.

Qatar pretends to be a mediator, the ‘honest broker’ of the Middle East,' Rabbi Pini Dunner, spiritual leader of the Beverly Hills Synagogue stated. By JNS Dozens of Jewish-American activists gathered outside the Los Angeles estate of former Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani on Sunday in protest against Doha’s support for Hamas. The demonstration was led by Rabbi Pini Dunner, spiritual leader of the Beverly Hills Synagogue. Protestors—carrying signs reading, 'A Terrorist Financier Lives Here' and 'HBJ – Go Back to Qatar'—chanted for the return of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre. 'Bin Jassim brought Hamas to Doha and funded them with $30 million monthly in Gaza,' Dunner declared during the rally. 'He is personally responsible for the Oct. 7th massacre. How is it possible that after all this, he lives in a luxurious mansion in Bel Air, Los Angeles?' 'Qatar pretends to be a mediator, the ‘honest broker’ of the Middle East,' the rabbi noted. 'But you know what they really are? They are financiers and supporters of terrorism. All they care about is sowing destruction and chaos in the world and then pretending to solve it.' Hamad bin Jassim (HBJ) of Qatar funneled billions into Hamas, fueling terror and the carnage of Oct. 7th. Yet, he lounges in luxury at 11201 Chalon Rd, Bel Air—a $118M mansion funded by blood money. Why is a terror financier living freely in LA? REVOKE his visa. SEIZE his assets. pic.twitter.com/rMZX0WCuUx &mdash; Pini Dunner (@pinidunner) February 17, 2025 Sunday’s rally was a direct continuation of a demonstration held by the Jewish community some two weeks ago outside the Maybourne Beverly Hills hotel, part of a chain owned by the Qataris, he said. Qatar—which has hosted Hamas and has provided the terror group with hundreds of millions of dollars—has helped mediate the freedom of some Israeli hostages in return for a truce and the release of jailed Palestinian terrorists. Doha has previously deflected accusations of playing a double game, saying the United States requested that it open the mediation channel. Israel’s governing coalition is advancing a bill to prohibit terror-funding states from playing a role in diplomatic affairs between Israel and other countries or foreign entities, which would remove Qatar as a mediator.

Recently freed terrorist Mohammed Abu Warda seen at Hamas ‘ceremo...	The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Mohammed Abu Warda, a Palestinian terrorist freed on Jan. 30 and who was supposed to be deported to a third country, has been seen at Hamas’ handover ceremony in Khan Yunis wearing a green keffiyeh associated with the terror group. Warda was serving 48 life sentences for attacks on Israeli busses that killed 44 people in the 1990s. Among the hundreds of Palestinian terrorists released by Israel under the terms of the ceasefire are 19 who were to be deported abroad via Egypt after being taken to the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza. That crossing is adjacent to the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Israel’s Kan News reported that Egypt is refusing to let them enter. Hamas says it is handing over the bodies of Shiri Bibas, her sons, Ariel and Kfir, and Oded Lifshitz today. Deferring to the families, Israel is not confirming the names until the bodies are positively identified. The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how many Israeli captives are alive. Hamas notified Israeli authorities in January that of the 33, eight are dead, but offered no evidence. Since the first hostage release on Jan. 19, Hamas has freed 19 Israeli and five Thai captives in exchange for 952 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists. Hostages Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham Al-Sayed are due to return home alive on Saturday. The fate of the remaining 65 hostages will be determined by negotiations during the ceasefire’s second phase. Critics say the phased approach condemns these 65 hostages to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 73 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed to be dead.

By Jewish Breaking News Ten-month-old Kfir Bibas, his four-year-old brother Ariel, and their mother Shiri never made it home to Israel alive after their abduction by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023. Instead, their story ended in three coffins being transported out of Gaza today, prompting their second homeland to prepare for a day of national mourning. 'I am informed by the government that they will wait for official information on the DNA results of the bodies and that, if confirmed, Argentina will then declare a National Day of Mourning in their honour,' President of the Argentinian Commission for Human Rights Sabrina Ajmeche wrote on X. 'Two Argentinian babies assassinated because of Hamas terrorism. I hope that never again, after this, I have to hear that what happens in Israel and Gaza is not our concern, of all Argentines.' Ajmeche also shared a video of the children with their mother, moments frozen in time when joy still seemed possible. 'They are ours, we love them always,' she wrote.

As officials now await DNA confirmation at Tel Aviv’s Abu Kabir forensic institute, Argentina’s ambassador to Israel, Axel Wahnish, voiced the nation’s collective anguish. 'Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas: EVERYONE IS THINKING ABOUT YOU. We are going through one of the most sensitive and tragic moments since that fateful Oct. 7. We accompany and support family members.' Along with the three Bibas family members, Hamas also released the body of 83-year-old hostage Oded Lifshitz. As the convoy bringing them back passed through Israel’s streets on Thursday, hundreds stood in solemn silence to pay tribute to the murdered hostages. The families will be informed after identification and have requested the public to await official confirmation, according to a statement by the Israeli police.

Azerbaijan may become a crucial player in Israeli-American vision...	The Atlantic Council, a prominent U.S. think tank, stated that the U.S. should follow Israel's lead in fostering ties with Azerbaijan. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following a meeting this week between Hikmet Hajiyev, Assistant to the President of Azerbaijan, and Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, officials described the 'game-changing' partnership between the Muslim nation, Israel, and the United States. 'Mr. Hajiyev conveyed the greetings of President Ilham Aliyev to Prime Minister Netanyahu,' the Azerbaijani Embassy in Israel stated. Hajiyev and Netanyahu discussed expanding bilateral cooperation, and diplomatic sources raised the possibility of including Azerbaijan in the Abraham Accords framework, alongside Israel and the U.S. The meeting between Netanyahu and Hajiyev took place just 48 hours after the Israeli Prime Minister met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Atlantic Council, a prominent U.S. think tank, stated that the U.S. should follow Israel's lead in fostering ties with Azerbaijan. The Atlantic Council said, 'Washington should learn from Israel’s diplomatic and security collaboration with Azerbaijan to bolster its own ties with Baku. Besides being a bulwark against Iran, close relations with Azerbaijan could help the United States gain a stronger foothold among Central Asian countries, with whom Azerbaijan has been developing stronger relations.' It continued, 'This would be especially important for the United States, as Central Asia is rich in minerals and energy and is home to the Middle Corridor, a trade route from Asia to Europe that bypasses both Russia and Iran.' In addition, the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies published a special Prospective Paper titled 'How to Effectively Engage Azerbaijan in Trump’s Regional Plans and in Israel’s Interests: Practical Recommendations.' The paper emphasized that the U.S. should aim for the inclusion of Azerbaijan in American-Israeli projects, including investment and technological development. Israelis are currently developing a partnership with Morocco as part of its projects with America and seeks to apply this model to other Sunni Gulf monarchies. These partnerships span defense, AI, and cybersecurity, aligning with the Trump Administration's vision of expanding multilateral alliances in the Middle East.

Investigators confirm identity of slain hostage Oded Lifshitz	After 503 days in captivity, the remains of Oded Lifshitz have been positively identified, hours after they were returned to Israel from Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Israeli forensics examiners at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute have positively identified the remains of one of the four bodies returned by Hamas on Thursday, confirming that the body of Oded Lifshitz was among those transferred to Israel. Lifshitz, a former journalist, was returned to Israel via the International Red Cross Thursday morning, along with the remains of Shiri Bibas and her sons, Ariel and Kfir - the two youngest hostages taken during the October 7th invasion. The four had been held in captivity in the Gaza Strip for 503 days. In a statement issued via the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Lifshitz's family expressed their 'deep sorrow' after Oded's identity was verified. 'We have received with deep sorrow the official and bitter news of the identification of our beloved Oded’s body. 503 agonizing days of uncertainty have come to an end. We so hoped and prayed that our ending would be different.' 'Now, we can mourn the husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather who has been missing from our lives since October 7th. Our family's healing will begin now and will not be complete until the last hostage is returned.' Lifshitz, who was 83 in October 2023, was abducted, along with his wife Yocheved, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th, 2023, before their home was torched by Hamas terrorists. The couple have been described as peace activists who volunteered to drive Gazans from the border into Israel for medical treatment. Yocheved was freed in October 2023, several weeks after being taken hostage.

Knesset votes to bar October 7th deniers from entering Israel	Under new law passed by the Knesset, Holocaust deniers, deniers of the Hamas massacres on October 7th, 2023, and anyone who supports the prosecution of Israeli soldiers will be barred from entering Israel. By World Israel News Staff The Knesset voted Wednesday night to bar Holocaust deniers and individuals who deny the Hamas massacres of Israelis on October 7th, 2023, from entering Israel. The bill, which was drafted by Coalition MK Mishel Buskila (New Hope), passed its final reading in the Knesset by a unanimous vote, 12 to 0. Based on existing legislation, the 2017 Amendment No. 28 to the Entry Into Israel Law which permits Israel to bar entry to non-citizens who have publicly endorsed the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, the new law enables the Interior Ministry to bar any non-citizen who denies the Holocaust or the October 7th massacres from entering Israel. Furthermore, the new law provides for barring entry to anyone who advocates for or publicly supports criminal prosecution abroad against Israeli soldiers or former service members. In addition, members or employees of organizations which back the prosecution of IDF soldiers abroad will also be barred from entering the country. 'The State of Israel, like any other country in the world, must defend itself, its citizens, soldiers, and national identity,' Buskila stated Wednesday ahead of the vote. 'Many countries in the world prohibit the entry of hostile entities who harm their security forces. Israel is a democratic country, but it is not naive. Those who support Israel will be respectfully welcomed. Those who attempt​ to undermine our very existence, deny the horrors of the past, or harm our soldiers and citizens, have no place among us.'

Nation mourns Bibas family, Oded Lifshitz as bodies transferred t...	Following the transfer from the Red Cross to IDF soldiers, a military memorial ceremony took place inside Gaza, featuring the Israeli flag, a salute ceremony, and a rabbi reciting from the Book of Psalms. By JNS Israel redeemed on Thursday the bodies of four slain hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza: the three members of the Bibas family—mother Shiri, infant son Kfir and his older brother Ariel, and octogenarian Oded Lifshitz. The Red Cross handed four coffins to Israel Defense Forces troops and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) agents in the Gaza Strip, after the Geneva-based agency received the caskets from the Hamas terrorist group following a propaganda ceremony. Israel filed a complaint with mediators and the Red Cross after the Hamas stage show, saying that it breached the terms of their agreement. IDF sappers inspected the caskets, which were locked without keys, to ensure they were not booby-trapped. The IDF also verified whether any personal belongings of the hostages were returned with the bodies. A brief military ceremony was held and presided over by the chief rabbi of the IDF before the bodies were taken to Israel for identification. Israelis waving national flags and yellow flags in solidarity with the hostages lined the route of the convoy carrying the bodies to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. There are now 69 hostages remaining in Hamas captivity in Gaza, of whom 36 are believed to be dead. Although the Israeli government has made the names public, official confirmation of the four hostages’ identity will depend on forensic analysis of the remains. On Wednesday, it emerged that the names were not to have been revealed prior to that confirmation, but were due to a miscommunication between the Israeli military and the government. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has urged the public to refrain from spreading rumors about the return of the slain captives and not to contact the families regarding the matter. 'The Coordinator for Captives and Missing Persons, Brigadier General (ret.) Gal Hirsch, has updated the families of the hostages through IDF representatives,' according to a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Thursday. 'In this difficult hour, our hearts are with the grieving families. We will continue to provide reliable information as required and request to avoid spreading rumors and unofficial information,' the statement continued. ‘Do not eulogize until there is confirmation‘ The Bibas family has issued a statement urging patience. 'If there is to be bitter news, we need to receive it through the proper channels after all identification procedures are completed. We ask not to eulogize our loved ones until there is confirmation after final identification,' it said.

Photo by Chaim Goldberg/Flash90. The Lifshitz family released a similar statement, noting that they had hoped things would turn out differently. 'These hours are not simple for us, after being informed that our beloved Oded is on the list of deceased hostages to be returned to Israel on Thursday, after being taken alive from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz [on Oct. 7, 2023]. For 502 days we hoped and prayed for a different ending, but until we receive absolute certainty our journey will not end, and even afterward we will continue to fight until the return of the last hostage. We ask the media and the public not to contact us regarding this matter at present and to respect our privacy.' Early morning: Handover process to begin The initial stage of the handover involved the Red Cross receiving the fallen from Hamas at a predetermined location in Khan Yunis before transferring them to the IDF. Following the transfer, a military memorial ceremony took place inside Gaza, featuring the Israeli flag, a salute ceremony and a rabbi reciting from the Book of Psalms. Dr. Gilad Bodenheimer, who heads Mental Health Services at the Israeli Ministry of Health, has advised against extended viewing of broadcasts covering the return: 'We anticipate an extremely complex day as we receive the fallen hostages, and strongly recommend that the public limit their media exposure and minimize their viewing of Hamas psychological warfare tactics.'

Identification process Following their return to Israel, the coffins were transported under police escort directly to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. There, experts were set to conduct tests to determine the cause and time of death. The institute will employ standard identification methods including imaging scans, DNA sample extraction and laboratory analysis, and comparison with existing medical records such as dental X-rays. Reference samples have already been prepared, including DNA profiles provided by the Israel Police. According to the IDF, the identification process may take up to 48 hours, depending on the condition of the remains. The families will be integral to the entire process. At their own request, they will remain at home rather than at a designated location, accompanied by IDF representatives. They will observe the military ceremony in real time, with documentation to be distributed afterward. The IDF will inform the families of the identification results before any public announcement is made. Professor Chen Kugel, who directs the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, elaborated: 'We will exhaust every possibility to determine the circumstances of death. This isn’t always achievable, particularly with fallen who arrive after an extended period. Our commitment is to do everything possible to provide answers to the families about what happened to their loved ones.' The confidential clause Political officials have clarified that this release represents an unpublicized portion of the phase one ceasefire agreement, whereby eight hostages who died in captivity are to be returned in two stages. In exchange, Israel will free women and minors detained in Gaza after Oct. 7, 2023. Simultaneously, mediating parties are preparing for discussions about the deal’s second phase. Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari stated on Tuesday that negotiations for the second phase haven’t officially commenced, though he confirmed that delegations from both Israel and Hamas are present in Doha.

How Jewish traditions kept hostages alive in Gaza captivity	Agam Berger, Keith Siegel, and Eli Sharabi reported how they put faith in God, prayed and tried to keep Jewish holy days in captivity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Acts of Jewish faith helped keep several hostages alive, they have reported since being released from Hamas captivity over the last several weeks. IDF observer Agam Berger, who was abducted from the Nahal Oz army base on the border with Gaza, told Channel 12 Thursday that she and her fellow observers had managed to observe many of the Jewish holidays. 'We sometimes had access to a radio, and sometimes we saw things on television that helped us track the date. We also had a foreign calendar,' she said. 'We missed both Hanukkah holidays, but we celebrated Passover, and I didn’t eat chametz [leavened food products that are forbidden],' she noted. 'I asked for cornmeal, and the captors brought it to me.' Although the captives were given very little food, with the women previously revealing that they counted the rice grains they received to ensure everyone got an equal amount, Berger even observed several fast days. These included the two important ones, Yom Kippur and Tisha B’Av, but also Taanit Esther, which is a minor fast day that many do not keep under perfectly normal conditions. Berger also kept the Sabbath as much as she could and, with the other women, constantly used a prayerbook that a terrorist had found in a field. 'They asked us what it was and then gave it to us. We used it throughout our captivity,' she said, noting that her captors seemed to respect the fact that they wanted to perform Jewish rites, even giving them Sabbath candles to light at certain points. 'They said all of Judaism is a lie, but they preferred someone who believes in God over someone who doesn’t,' she said. In an interview on Channel 14 Wednesday, the daughter of American-Israel hostage Keith Siegel, said that her father had 'searched for his Jewish identity while in captivity, and he found it in small prayers.' 'He began saying blessings over food,' Shir Siegel said, 'which he had never said before, and ‘Shema Yisrael’, which he had never recited in his life.' The Shema is one of the iconic Jewish prayers that announces one’s belief in a single God of Israel. 'He said that amidst all that hell, he wanted to remember that he was Jewish, that there was meaning to his people and to the place from which he came, and that strengthened him greatly,' she said. Siegel was starved, moved 33 times over 15 months, was often kept in the dark while being told to lie down and keep silent, and spent the last two months of captivity alone. The Shema also featured strongly in the life of Eli Sharabi, who was freed on February 8. His brother Sharon told Channel 12 last week that every day of captivity, Eli had made sure to say the prayer. He and the other hostages he was with also kept track of the days of the week, and every Friday night, in honor of the incoming Sabbath, he would recite the Kiddush, a blessing recited over wine or grape juice before the meal – although they had nothing to drink or eat, as they were cruelly starved by their captors. They also sang the 'Woman of Valor' Sabbath song, which men traditionally sing each week in praise of their wives. All these acts of faith 'is what kept them going,' Sharabi said. Crushingly, Eli found out upon his release that his wife, Lianne, as well as his daughters Noya (16) and Yahel (13), had been murdered in their Kibbutz Be’eri home by terrorists during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 invasion, among 1,200 others slaughtered in Gaza envelope communities and a dance festival.

Blaming Netanyahu for captives’ deaths, Hamas uses coffins for vi...	Hamas uses coffins of dead captives for anti-Israel display during ceremony marking the handing over of remains of four Israeli hostages - while accusing IDF of killing the hostages. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization held a victory celebration in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Yunis Thursday morning, putting the coffins of four Israeli hostages on display before they were handed over to Israel as part of the hostage deal. At 9:40 a.m., Hamas transferred the remains of Oded Lifshitz, Shiri Bibas, and her sons Ariel and Kfir, to the International Red Cross, which handed the bodies over to an IDF force. Prior to the handoff, however, Hamas displayed the coffins of the four slain hostages on a stage set up on an abandoned cemetery in Khan Yunis, as part of a ceremony and photo op, during which Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the United States were denounced and blamed for the deaths of the four hostages. Masked Hamas terrorists met with International Red Cross officials on the stage, signing off papers certifying the transfer of the hostages' remains. The coffins of the four victims were displayed underneath a massive sign portraying Netanyahu as a vampire. 'The War Criminal Netanyahu & His Nazi Army Killed Them with Missiles from Zionist Warplanes,' the sign read. Mock missiles and rockets set up around the stage carried messages blaming the U.S. for the hostages' deaths. 'They were killed by USA bombs.' Underneath photographs of the hostages, Hamas wrote 'The Killer,' above a photograph of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, along with the date 11-2023, implying the hostages were killed in November 2023. During the victory ceremony in Khan Yunis, thousands of Gazans gathered and cheered as Hamas displayed the coffins of the slain hostages, clapping and whistling as organizers played celebratory music. Terrorists present at the event brandished weapons, including machine guns, grenades, anti-personnel mines, and even missiles. Mohammed Abu Warda, a Hamas terrorist and convicted mass murderer, was among those in attendance at the ceremony. Abu Warda, who was released as part of the hostage deal, was convicted of multiple counts of murder and sentenced to 48 consecutive life sentences for his role in a pair of suicide bomb attacks in the 1990s.

Trump admin designates drug cartels as global terrorist organizat...	Classifying the cartels as terrorist groups helps disrupt their 'finances through sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans,' though the scope of Wednesday's designations remains unclear, Reuters reported. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon The United States has designated Tren de Aragua, the Sinaloa cartel, and six other drug cartels as global terrorist organizations, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday in a notice. The cartels threaten U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economic stability, according to the notice. The designations follow President Donald Trump's executive order directing officials to assess whether transnational gangs and drug cartels should be classified as terrorist organizations. The move marks a significant escalation in Trump's efforts to combat cartel-driven crime following record-high illegal border crossings under the Biden administration. Classifying the cartels as terrorist groups helps disrupt their 'finances through sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans,' though the scope of Wednesday's designations remains unclear, Reuters reported. Last May, then-Drug Enforcement Administration head Anne Milgram, a Biden appointee, said the United States is facing 'the most dangerous and deadly drug crisis' in history, particularly pointing to 'synthetic, chemical-based drugs, like fentanyl and methamphetamine.' Fentanyl is responsible for around 70 percent of overdose deaths, the DEA noted at the time, with meth responsible for the remaining 30 percent. 'At the heart of the synthetic drug crisis are the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels and their associates,' Milgram said. Since taking office, Trump has declared a national border emergency and ordered top officials to prepare to invoke a 1798 law that could allow the administration to swiftly deport suspected gang members without court hearings. Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has reinforced border security and overseen the deportation of thousands of illegal immigrants. Tren de Aragua, a violent Venezuelan gang, has expanded its operations across several U.S. cities, terrorizing residents at apartment complexes and engaging in human trafficking, extortion, and drug smuggling. Federal authorities have arrested dozens affiliated with the gang, including 67 members on January 26 alone. Mexico's Sinaloa cartel is 'woven into our communities,' both in major U.S. cities and other places, retired Drug Enforcement Administration supervisory special agent Brian Townsend told Fox News on Tuesday. 'We have some larger locations that are well known for Sinaloa control, like Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Tucson, Dallas, Atlanta, and New York City.' 'But they have distribution points throughout the United States,' Townsend went on, 'and from there, they use those hubs, and then [the distribution] spoke out from there into our communities.'

Israeli forces kill three armed terrorists near Jenin	Following the engagement, security forces conducted thorough searches, uncovering a disassembled M-16 rifle hidden underground, additional weaponry, and a handgun. By JNS Israeli forces killed three armed terrorists in the Al-Fara area south of Jenin in northern Samaria on Wednesday, according to the military. The coordinated counterterrorism operation involved Israel Defense Forces soldiers alongside the Israel Border Police’s 'Yamam' National Counter-Terrorism Unit, guided by Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) intelligence. According to the IDF, the terrorists were involved in weapons trafficking. Two additional suspects were apprehended during the operation.

ICC used flawed data to secure arrest warrants against Israeli le...	UKLFI’s latest review shows that reports of famine on which the prosecutor relied were not plausible and were based on inaccurate and anomalous data regarding food supplies and malnutrition.' By Jewish Breaking News Significant errors and flawed methodology tainted the evidence of famine in Gaza that led to the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to UK Lawyers for Israel Charitable Trust (UKLFI), the evidence for these claims simply doesn’t hold up. First, the very definition of famine was misapplied. The term 'famine' isn’t just dramatic language but rather a specific scientific classification developed in Somalia in 2004 by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. UKLFI’s report argues that Gaza’s crisis, while 'undoubtedly serious,' doesn’t meet these technical standards. Second, the ICC relied heavily on data from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS Net), a USAID initiative that’s now offline following Trump administration funding freezes. Third, the report identifies what it calls 'inaccurate and anomalous data' about food supplies and malnutrition rates, suggesting that worst-case scenarios were presented as inevitable outcomes rather than possibilities. 'Warrants for the arrest of Netanyahu and Gallant have been issued by the ICC on the false ground that Israel deliberately used starvation as a method of war,' says Jonathan Turner, UKLFI’s executive director. 'UKLFI’s latest review shows that reports of famine on which the prosecutor relied were not plausible and were based on inaccurate and anomalous data regarding food supplies and malnutrition.' UKLFI’s report calls for more rigorous standards in assessing humanitarian crises, including clearer distinctions between current conditions, projections, and worst-case scenarios. The stakes are too high for anything less. Just recently, ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan found himself banned from entering the U.S. under new sanctions. President Donald Trump’s executive order blasted what he called the court’s 'illegitimate and baseless actions' against Israel. Meanwhile, the ICC’s oversight body has been tasked to investigate allegations that Khan tried to coerce a female aide against her will. Khan has repeatedly denied the allegations, stating there is 'no truth' to the claim.

Trump halts US funding of Palestinian police – report	The cut in funding is part of the Trump administration’s overall freeze on international aid. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The U.S. has frozen funding for the Palestinian Authority's (PA) security forces, as part of the Trump administration’s overall freeze on international aid, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. In Trump’s first stint as president, he stopped direct aid to the PA but kept on funding the training of its security forces, which is implemented through the U.S. Security Coordinator’s Office (USSC) in Jerusalem. The paper cited an anonymous former Israeli official as saying that the USSC 'was not significantly affected' by the cut, as 'other donors have committed to make up the shortfall.' Palestinian sources say that there have been immediate ramifications due to the freeze. A colonel in the PA’s Central Training Institute told the Post that as a result of the freeze it had to stop construction of a virtual shooting range, although it was nearly complete. The security forces officially learn to shoot this way because out of security concerns, Israel forbids the importation of real bullets to the PA. The tens of thousands of men dispersed among the various branches of the Palestinian Security Services are well-armed, however, as evidenced by the recent deadly clashes in Jenin, when the PA failed in its attempt to take control of the city that is a hotbed of terrorist groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad that want to overthrow the Authority. Another Palestinian official said that a meeting that had been organized between PA and American security forces to assess the PA’s performance in Jenin had been indefinitely postponed. The USSC has been providing direct financial and personnel assistance to Palestinian security organizations since 2005 and training them since 2007. According to the State Department, besides upgrading the Palestinians’ military abilities to 'assist in ending violence' internally, another major part of its mission is to 'facilitat[e] security cooperation' with Israel, and 'setting security conditions for a peace agreement.' One of its original aims was also to 'allay Israeli fears about the nature and capabilities of the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF),' in the words of Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton, who led the Office for its first five years. While top Israeli military and intelligence officials have considered security coordination with the PA as vital to the IDF’s anti-terror efforts in Judea and Samaria throughout the years, the government also sees the PASF as a danger. Although potential recruits are officially extensively vetted by the U.S. for any affiliation with a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization and for human rights violations, Palestinian security personnel have been responsible for hundreds of terror attacks on Israeli civilians over the past two decades.

The power of faith: How Tzili Schneider became a beacon of hope f...	Schneider's journey with the families of Israel’s hostages did not begin with a grand strategy, but with a deep, empathetic connection to their suffering—one that ultimately reignited the nation’s faith. By Linda Argalgi Sadacka, Special to World Israel News In times of profound adversity, certain individuals emerge as beacons of hope, transforming personal anguish into collective resilience. Tzili Schneider, founder of Kesher Yehudi (Jewish Connection), is one such figure. Her journey with the families of Israel’s hostages did not begin with a grand strategy, but with a deep, empathetic connection to their suffering—one that ultimately reignited the nation’s faith. A mission born from heartbreak Moved by the plight of parents, siblings, and children of those taken captive, Tzili immersed herself in the protest tents of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, offering support in the only way that truly mattered: by listening. She posed a pivotal question to these families: 'What do you desire most?' The answer was immediate and unanimous: 'Our children.' But then she asked a deeper question: 'From whom are you seeking their return?' Tzili Schneider (back shown) comforts Merav Gonen, mother of freed hostage Romi Gonen. Door on right leads to a synagogue. (Courtesy) The realization was profound. Beyond political figures, beyond military strategies, beyond backdoor negotiations—their hope rested in a higher power: God. It was this moment of clarity that led Tzili to propose something radical: a national call for faith—a single, unified Shabbat (Sabbath) observed across the country as a plea for divine mercy. This was not a tactical maneuver. It was a recognition of an eternal truth: Jewish survival has never been political. It has always been spiritual. A movement that transcended divisions The response was overwhelming. Communities across Israel mobilized, bridging gaps between secular and religious Jews in a way that had seemed impossible just weeks before. Through Kesher Yehudi, Tzili spearheaded this unprecedented movement, guiding over 35 hostage families toward a deeper spiritual connection. This unity was not about external labels. It was about an unshakable Jewish instinct—the knowledge that, in times of crisis, Jews trust one another. The lookouts stationed on the border, the kidnapped soldiers, the civilians dragged into Gaza—all of them had endured the valley of the shadow of death with one unifying truth: They never lost their faith. Faith in the depths of Gaza These hostages did not emerge from the tunnels of Gaza as the same people they were before. Throughout their captivity, they clung to Jewish identity as a lifeline—observing mitzvot (Torah commandments) wherever and however they could. They fasted on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), refrained from eating non-kosher food, and even kept Shabbat in the heart of enemy territory. The lookouts, in particular, observed several mitzvot together, including Yom Kippur, Tisha B’Av (the Ninth of Av, a day of mourning for the destruction of the Temples), and avoiding chametz (leavened bread) on Pesach (Passover). Not a single one of them agreed to eat chametz throughout the entire holiday. They knew exactly which day was Shabbat and did their best to observe it. Among them, Agam Berger, an IDF surveillance soldier, became a pillar of strength. Captured during the attack on Nahal Oz on October 7, 2023, she endured 482 days in captivity—and throughout it all, she refused to compromise her faith. She fully observed Shabbat and refused to eat non-kosher meat, even as her captors starved her. Not once did she break, despite her friends pleading with her to eat for her own survival. When Agam’s mother, Meirav Berger, learned of her release, she was filled with gratitude—not only for her daughter’s return but for the unwavering faith that sustained her through captivity. 'We saw God with our own eyes' This was not an isolated phenomenon. Every hostage who emerged from Gaza carried the same testimony: 'We saw God with our own eyes.' For Romi Gonen, the first girl to be released in the most recent deal, the experience of captivity led to a profound transformation. Her mother, Merav Gonen, was the very first person to sign up for a national Shabbat initiative, dedicating her observance to the release of the hostages. Exactly one year later, Romi was freed. When she finally embraced her mother, her first words were not about the suffering she endured. Instead, she declared: 'I am Jewish. I was in captivity, and there I truly felt that I was Jewish. And being Jewish means keeping Shabbat. So from now on, we will keep Shabbat.' She was not alone. Kfir Segal, an elderly Jewish man, endured some of the harshest conditions of captivity. His captors starved him, humiliated him, spat on him, and beat him—yet his faith remained unshaken. Freed hostage Agam Berger, who has spoken publicly about maintaining her faith during captivity, receives a prayer book from Tzili Schneider. (Courtesy) Upon his release, he turned to his children and made a single request: 'We had 500 days to reflect on ourselves. A lot of time to think. My thoughts led me to God and to the realization that I am Jewish. From now on, I want all of us to sit together and learn about our own Judaism.' The Kiddush that kept hope alive Omer Shem Tov was taken captive on Shabbat Kodesh (the holy Sabbath) and remains in captivity to this day. Just a few days after his abduction, by Tuesday or Wednesday, he turned to his friend Itai and asked: 'Shabbat is coming soon. How will we make Kiddush (blessing over wine or grape juice to sanctify the Shabbat and holidays)? I have never missed reciting Kiddush on Shabbat.' Itai asked their captors about it, and the next day, they received a tiny bottle of grape juice. Omer carefully rationed the bottle, using just a drop each week for Kiddush, knowing that their captivity could last years. Every Shabbat, he recited Kiddush by heart in the darkness of the tunnels. His mother, Shelly Shem Tov, became fully Shabbat-observant as a result. She joined a group of women learning the laws of Shabbat, determined that when Omer returns, everything in their home will be done according to halacha (Jewish law). The same was true for Sasha Tropanov, whose mother and grandmother were kidnapped alongside him. They were freed in the first hostage deal over a year ago—and each of them independently decided to become religious. In a now-viral video, Sasha is seen wearing tefillin (phylacteries) upon his return home this past Shabbat, his first request after being reunited with his family. His mother, Yelena, always knew that when he came back, he would follow the same spiritual path she had chosen. Because when you see God with your own eyes, there is no other path. The time for faith and unity is now These are not stories of religious coercion. They are stories of spiritual awakening—of Jews who faced the abyss, held onto their identity, and emerged with an unshakable belief in Hashem’s (G-d’s) presence in their lives. This is the lesson that Tzili Schneider and Kesher Yehudi have been working tirelessly to share: Faith is not a relic of the past. It is the foundation of Jewish survival. The hostages have returned with a message: Our future belongs to those who stand firm, who hold fast to their faith, and who refuse to surrender—no matter the cost.

Republicans divided over Trump’s Gaza plan	Americans largely oppose president's plan to take control of the Gaza Strip, new polls find, with Republicans sharply divided over the proposal. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Few Americans support President Donald Trump's plan to place the war torn Gaza Strip under U.S. control, with even the president's own party sharply divided over the proposal. According to a poll published by Quinnipiac University on Wednesday, just 22% of registered voters say they back Trump's bid to take over the Gaza Strip, compared to 62% of respondents who oppose it. A plurality of Republicans back the plan, with 49% saying they support it, compared to 32% who oppose it. However, just 1% of Democrats support the proposal, compared to 94% who oppose it. Among independents, just 17% say they support the plan, compared to 66% who oppose it. 'The grand plan to transform a shattered Gaza into a lavish American restoration project on the Mediterranean has many more skeptics than supporters,' said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy. Respondents were somewhat more supportive of Trump's handling of the Israel - Hamas conflict, with 38% said they approved of his policies on the issue, including 78% of Republicans, 37% of independents, and 4% of Democrats. By contrast, 47% of registered voters disapprove, including 9% of Republicans, 48% of independents, and 87% of Democrats. A second poll released Wednesday also found little support for Trump's Gaza plan. The survey, conducted by Emerson College Polling, found that just 18% of Americans support Trump's Gaza plan, with 58% opposing it. Unlike the Quinnipiac poll, Emerson found that a plurality of Republicans oppose the proposal, by a margin of 45% against to 31% in favor. Just 12% of Democrats and 10% of independents back the plan. Trump's Gaza plan appears to be significantly more popular among Israelis, however, with 75% of Israeli Jews telling the Lazar Research Institute in a recent poll that they support the proposal. The Quinnipiac poll surveyed 1,039 self-identified registered voters nationwide from February 13th through the 17th, and has a margin of error of +/- 3.0 points. The Emerson poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters and has a similar margin of error. It was conducted from February 15th through the 17th.

Bodies of Shiri Bibas, her children, and Oded Lifshitz returned t...	Hamas hands over the remains of four Israeli civilians - including the two youngest hostages - to Israel via the International Red Cross. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization handed over the remains of four slain Israeli civilians held hostage since October 7th, 2023, to the International Red Cross Thursday morning, as part of the ongoing hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire. The captives include 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, 33-year-old Shiri Bibas, and her two sons - the youngest Israelis taken hostage by Gazan terrorists on October 7th - Ariel and Kfir. The two boys would have been five and two years old respectively. After an event held by Hamas in the Bani Suheila neighborhood of the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis Thursday morning, during which four coffins were presented on stage, the remains of the four Israeli captives were transferred to the International Red Cross at 9:50 a.m. Half an hour later, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office announced that the coffins carrying the four slain hostages had been handed over to an IDF force. 'Israel has received, through the Red Cross, the coffins of four fallen hostages,' the PMO said. 'The coffins were handed over to the IDF and Shin Bet forces, within the Gaza Strip area, from where they will be transferred to Israel to the National Forensic Medicine Institute of the Ministry of Health. After the identification process is completed, an official notice will be delivered to the families.' 'The families of the hostages have been updated, and in this difficult time, our hearts are with them.' Lifshitz, a former journalist, was abducted, along with his wife Yocheved, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th, 2023, before their home was torched by Hamas terrorists. The couple have been described as peace activists who volunteered to drive Gazans from the border into Israel for medical treatment. Shiri Bibas and her children, Ariel and Kfir, were also residents of Nir Oz. Video taken at around 10:00 a.m. on October 7th shows the three being taken hostage by a group of terrorists aligned with the Katayeb al-Mujahideen group. 'Agony. Pain. There are no words,' President Isaac Herzog said Thursday morning following the transfer of the hostages' remains. 'Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters.' 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely. May their memory be a blessing.'

Religious Zionism: If Gaza war ends, we’ll leave the gov’t	MK Moshe Solomon stresses his party will leave the coalition, if Israel does not return to fighting Hamas by March 2nd. By World Israel News Staff A politician from the Religious Zionism party stressed his faction's position that Israel must resume hostilities against the Hamas terror group, or else face the collapse of the government. MK Moshe Solomon said in a recent radio interview that the second phase of the hostage deal requires a full IDF withdrawal from Gaza and a long-term ceasefire, which his party is unwilling to support. 'I expect [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] and cabinet to fulfil their commitment where we complete phase 1 of the deal and [then] act with military force against the Hamas terror organization. I believe this is how we can bring back the hostages who are [still] there,' Solomon told Radio North. 'Currently, phase 1 has ended with everything that was promised, despite Hamas's violations.' When asked about phase two of the deal, which would see Israeli troops retreat from Gaza in exchanged for the return of additional live hostages, Solomon said it 'won't happen.' Solomon noted that the ceasefire outlined in the first stage of the deal is slated to last for 42 days. If Israel does not return to fighting on Sunday, March 2nd, Religious Zionism will leave the government, Solomon added. Opposition parties, including Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid, have pledged to provide a safety net to Netanyahu's Likud, in order to ensure the hostage deal continues. The status of negotiations for the terms of the second phase of the ceasefire is currently unclear. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff has expressed confidence that despite the concerns of some right-wing Israeli parties, the second stage of the ceasefire and hostage deal will happen. Speaking to Fox News earlier this week, Witkoff said that 'phase two is absolutely going to begin.' He added at a memorial event marking 500 days since October 7th, 2023, that 'we are not leaving anybody behind. We have to get everybody home.'

Ari Fuld’s murderer and other terrorists to be freed Saturday	There’s no guidebook for how to feel when your brother is murdered and gone forever, while his killer will walk free,' writes Hillel Fuld. By World Israel News Staff A number of high-profile terrorists, including the man who killed American-Israeli Ari Fuld, are set to be freed Saturday in exchange for the return of six Israeli hostages from Hamas captivity. The release will see 602 terrorists freed from Israeli prisons, including 157 sentenced to life or decades-long sentences. The murderer of Ari Fuld, Khalil Yusef Ali Jabarin, who was 17 at the time of the murder, is slated to be released after spending just six years in an Israeli prison. 'The monster who changed our family forever is now on the list of terrorists set to be freed as part of the upcoming hostage deal. Upon hearing the news of this terrorist's release, I had to catch my breath,' wrote Fuld's brother Hillel, a prominent tech blogger and consultant, in a column published in Ynet. 'There’s no guidebook for how to feel when your brother is murdered and gone forever, while his killer will walk free and live as a regular citizen.' While Fuld stressed that he felt extremely conflicted about the release, he added that he understood the release would save the lives of the hostages - which brings him some comfort. Another notorious terrorist scheduled for release on Saturday is Bilal Abu Ghanem, who murdered three Israelis in a shooting and stabbing spree on a Jerusalem bus in October 2015. Originally sentenced to 135 years, Abu Ghanem will be freed after serving less than ten years for the murders of Haim Haviv, 78, Alon Govberg, 51, and Richard Lakin, 76. Na’el al-Barghouti, 68, is also expected to be released after serving 45 years for the 1978 murder of bus driver Mordechai Yakuel. Notably, al-Barghouti was freed in the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal, but later re-arrested. He will likely be deported to a third country. According to Hebrew-language media reports, al-Barghouti is a relative and close confidant of arch-terrorist Marwan Barghouti.

Woman wounded in Jerusalem axe attack, police hunt assailant	Suspect broke into elderly woman's home and attacked her with an axe; police launch manhunt to arrest perpetrator. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli woman was attacked by an axe-wielding assailant late Wednesday night, with the manhunt for the perpetrator still ongoing. The victim, reported by Hebrew-language media as being in her 70s, was moderately wounded in the attack, which occurred at her home in the Old City. According to Ynet, the suspect, armed with an axe, broke into the woman's home. After the attack, he reportedly removed the hoodie he had been wearing - likely due to blood stains - and fled the scene. 'I arrived at the scene and saw the victim, [who was] fully conscious. She was lying [on the floor] with injuries to her upper body,' said Yossi Kasuto, a senior Magen David Adom paramedic, in a media statement. 'I gave her life-saving medical treatment and we transferred her to the special MDA ATV that evacuated her through the narrow alleyways of Jerusalem&#8230;to an ambulance that was waiting at the Zion Gate. From there we evacuated her while continuing medical treatment to the hospital, with her condition [being] moderate and stable.' The police said in a press statement that they had dispatched forensic officers to gather evidence at the scene;. The Jerusalem Police District Commander 'conducted a situational assessment, during which he directed the use of all means and forces in order to locate the suspect who fled.' As of Thursday, the police have yet to locate the attacker. Details about his identity and the motivation for the attack have not yet been made public. In December 2024, a janitor who worked in a Jerusalem apartment building broke into the home of an elderly Jewish woman. He strangled and stabbed the woman, 74, then stole her jewelry and fled the apartment, believing he had murdered her. The woman, seriously wounded, managed to call for help. The suspect was arrested hours later, and the attempted murder was classified as a terror attack by Israeli authorities.

Berger, 20, was one of five lookouts who scouted the Gaza border, were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023 and released after 15 months. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, U.S. President Trump reposted a video of freed hostage Agam Berger, who thanked him for securing her release and advocating for the other hostages. Berger, 20, was one of five lookouts who scouted the Gaza border and were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. She was released in the first phase of the hostage deal. Berger thanked Trump, saying, 'From the bottom of my heart, thank you for all you have done and all that you continue to do for the hostages.' 'Because of you, we came home,' she said, explaining that there are still people who depend on him and are waiting for him to save them. Berger added that President Trump 'has the power to do it.' The hostage deal took effect on January 19, the day before Trump's inauguration as President of the United States. 'I beg you, don’t stop until all the hostages, both the living and the dead, are brought home,' Berger said to Trump. Donald Trump Truth Social Post 07:45 PM EST 02/17/25 pic.twitter.com/ngMTnpnxX7 &mdash; Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) February 18, 2025 On Thursday, the bodies of four hostages, including Shiri Bibas and her two young children, will be returned to Gaza. On Saturday, six living hostages are expected to be released. Berger was released along with Israeli civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80 along with five Thai workers. The other four female IDF lookouts, Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev, and Daniella Gilboa, were released a week earlier. Dr. Lena Koren Feldman, director of Rabin Medical Center’s Beilinson Hospital, told Israel’s Channel 12 News that the four IDF soldiers kidnapped alongside Berger and who were released by Hamas on Saturday screamed with excitement when they saw her being freed. Agam Berger and other hostages maintained religious observance during their captivity in Gaza. Liri Albag reported that Agam Berger held fast to her religious observance during her captivity, including keeping kosher and observing Shabbat. 'Despite the difficult conditions and limited options, Agam chose to stay true to her values and her faith,' Liri said. Liri’s mother, Merav, said that her daughter did not eat any of the non-kosher meat offered to her during captivity, despite the lack of food. Prior to her daughter’s release, Merav Berger requested that if her daughter would be released on Saturday, that those involved and the media should avoid violating Shabbat.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A forensic expert stated that identifying the bodies of hostages who have been held in Gaza for an extended period may not always be possible. On Thursday, the bodies of four hostages, held in captivity for over 500 days, are expected to be returned to Israel. Dr. Chen Kugel, director of the L. Greenberg Institute of Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir, described the process of examining and identifying the bodies before they are sent for burial. Dr. Kugel will work alongside pathologists, DNA analysts, anthropologists, radiologists, and forensic technicians. Kugel explained that identification is carried out using various scientific methods, all of which involve comparing data from the deceased with records from when they were still living. The first step in the process is a CT scan, which creates a detailed internal image. Radiologists then compare this image with previous medical records. The next phase is the autopsy, during which DNA samples will be sent to the lab for analysis, and forensic dentists will compare the teeth with existing dental records. The entire process will take several days. Afterward, the family will be contacted, and the public will receive updates, if permitted by the family. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Medical Directorate at the Health Ministry, stated, 'The upcoming phase tomorrow is both complex and sensitive, and we will do everything in our power to ensure the slain hostages are laid to rest as swiftly as possible.' Israel is preparing to receive the bodies of hostages who were murdered in captivity in the Gaza Strip on Thursday. The ceasefire deal with the Palestinian terrorist group stipulates that the bodies of four hostages will be returned to the Jewish state on the 33rd day of the ceasefire, which began on Jan. 19. Among those whose bodies will be handed over to Israel on Thursday are Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir.

By Aamer Madhani, Jonathan Cooper, Associated Press President Donald Trump called Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections,' lashing out after the Ukrainian president said Trump was being influenced by Russian disinformation as he moves to end the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow. Trump called Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections,' lashing out after the Ukrainian president said Trump was being influenced by Russian disinformation as he moves to end the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow. In a post on Truth Social, Trump called Zelenskyy 'a modestly successful comedian' who talked the United States into spending billions of dollars 'to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start.' He said Ukraine would be unable to end the war without Trump’s help. Trump’s post comes a day after he suggested in a news conference that Ukraine should hold elections as part of a peace plan. 'A Dictator without Elections,' Trump wrote Wednesday. Zelenskyy was elected president in 2019 after a career as an entertainer. He resisted pressure to leave the country when Russia invaded in 2022, mounting a defense that protected the capital, Kyiv. Zelenskyy accused Trump earlier Wednesday of living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space.'

Bibas family ‘in deep turmoil’ following Hamas announcement	Bibas family: 'Until we receive definitive confirmation, our ordeal is not over. We kindly ask the media and the public to respect our privacy and refrain from contacting us about this issue.' The Bibas family said on Tuesday that they were troubled by a Hamas statement earlier in the day that the bodies of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, are among those the terrorist group will return to Israel on Thursday. 'In the past few hours, we have been in deep turmoil following the announcement by a Hamas spokesperson regarding the planned return of our beloved Shiri, Ariel and Kfir this Thursday as part of the release of hostages’ remains,' the family said in a statement provided by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. 'We want to emphasize that while we are aware of these reports, we have not received any official confirmation on the matter,' the statement continued. 'Until we receive definitive confirmation, our ordeal is not over. We kindly ask the media and the public to respect our privacy and refrain from contacting us about this issue.' The Israel Defense Forces also responded to the reports, emphasizing that the public should follow official military statements regarding the state of the hostages. 'In the past few hours, unfounded rumors have been spreading regarding the hostages and their families,' the IDF said. 'The IDF urges the public to rely only on official statements from authorized sources and to refrain from spreading false rumors that harm the hostages’ families and the public.' Hamas agreed on Tuesday to double the number of living hostages it will release on Saturday from three to six, and the terror group has also said that it will release the bodies of four dead hostages on Thursday, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two children. Shiri Bibas, 33, her husband Yarden, 35, and Ariel, 5 and Kfir, 2, were on the list of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement. However, Hamas had claimed in November 2023 that Shiri and the children had been killed. Yarden was freed alive on Feb. 1 along with Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegel. Eight of the 33 hostages intended for release during the first phase are dead, according to a list provided by Hamas. Hamas named the Israelis to be freed on Saturday as Tal Shoham, Omer Shem-Tov, Omer Wenkert and Eliya Cohen, all of whom were kidnapped during the terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. In addition, Hamas said it would also release Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who have been held captive in the Strip for a decade and reportedly suffer from mental illness. An Israeli official told Maariv on Tuesday that the body of Hadar Goldin will not be returned to Israel this week but is expected to be transferred toward the end of phase one next week. Hamas has held Goldin’s body since he was killed during 'Operation Protective Edge' in 2014.

New Syrian textbooks designed to produce more jihadis	In the new schoolbooks, the role of women in Arab history is being deliberately downplayed; for Islam relegates women to a lower rank than men. By Hugh Fitzgerald, Frontpage Magazine The new textbooks in Syria of course eliminate all praise, direct and indirect, of the Assad family, father and son, but when it comes to Israel and Jews, those textbooks remain unchanged: 'New Syrian government issues textbooks filled with antisemitism and praise for terrorists,' by Jane Prinsley, Jewish Chronicle, February 7, 2025: Multiple maps in a geography textbook for 14 – 15-year-olds present all of Israel’s internationally recognized territory as Palestine. The Israel-controlled Golan Heights are presented as part of Syria, and the textbook cover features an image of the Sea of Galilee, which is located within Israeli territory, potentially suggesting that the lake, or parts of it, belong to Syria. It’s unclear whether Israel is depicted as existing within the 1949 armistice lines, or if has been effaced altogether. What is clear is that the Israel that now exists is not shown on those maps. Some historical women have been removed, including references to Nazik al-Abid, known as the 'Joan of Arc of the Arabs', Queen Zenobia and Khawla bint al-Azwar, in Islamic education and social studies textbooks for children aged eight to nine years old…. In the new schoolbooks, the role of women in Arab history is being deliberately downplayed; for Islam relegates women to a lower rank than men. In the 20th century, Nazik al-Abid obtained her fame as a defender of women’s rights; this is not a cause that the new Islamic regime would favor. Queen Zenobia dates from the 3rd century A.D., which means she lived during the Time of Ignorance, the Jahaliyya, so is hardly someone to emulate or admire. And Khawla bint al-Azwar, a warrior during the time of the Rashidun, believed that Ali was the first rightly-guided caliph, making her in effect a Shi’a, and she would naturally have no place in the schoolbook pantheon of the new, uber-Sunni regime in Damascus. The watchdog also found that some 'secular scientific concepts perceived to be un-Islamic' have been removed. An entire chapter in a biology textbook for 13 – 14-year-olds on evolution has been removed. All devout Muslims know that 'evolution' is only a 'theory.' And since evolution is contradicted by Islamic teachings, it is best to put off teaching it to students until they can be 'Islamically' prepared to withstand its appeal, 'Martyrdom' will be reframed in the new textbooks from a national to a religious perspective. One year 10 lesson will glorify martyrdom as an exalted deed worthy of reward by Allah, by replacing the term 'a person giving away his soul to defend his homeland' with 'a person giving away his soul for the sake of Allah.' The nationalist message has been eliminated, to be replaced by an Islamic one: children are not told to sacrifice for the 'homeland' of Syria but to become, rather, martyrs for the sake of Allah. And what is to be done 'for the sake of Allah'? Sacrificing yourself to promote the spread of Islam, expanding the umma, and killing Infidels. Just like Dalia al-Mughrabi, who was killed during the Coastal Road Massacre, in which she helped to murder 38 Israeli civilians, including 13 children. Al-Mughrabi is in the new textbooks, held up as a model to be emulated. The main backer of al-Jolani’s rebel group HTS in its war against Assad was Erdogan’s Turkey. Turkey is still the main foreign backer of the new regime in Damascus, though there may later be a parting of the ways if Turkey insists on keeping a military presence in northern Syria to suppress the Kurds. But right now, Turkey is a friend, and the Ottomans need to be referred to without animus. Thus, the Ottoman 'occupation' mentioned in Assad-era textbooks has now become the Ottoman 'regime,' which is not pejorative but simply matter-of-fact. There is also no more emphasis on Syria itself, as was found in previous textbooks. Now the focus is squarely on Islam, and the worldwide umma. Statements against Jews remain, as do those against all the Western powers — warmongers and exploiters who suck the 'blood of the innocents.' Al-Jolani’s repeatedly expressed desire to focus only on Syria, making sure that all of its armed groups give up their weapons and become part of a national army, and his unwillingness to try to pressure Israel to withdraw from the territory it has just taken over on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, are reassuring. But then there are those new schoolbooks, just released, that have become even more Islamic in their contents, and that will influence the minds of Syrian children, whose Islam-infused curriculum will lead some of them inexorably to become jihadis themselves. The Israelis, who continue to hold back from responding to what some have taken to be overtures made by al-Jolani to the Jewish state, are right to do so. If you are wondering why, just look at what remains and what has been changed, for the worse, in the new textbooks now to be used in Syrian schools; Impact-se lays it all out.
