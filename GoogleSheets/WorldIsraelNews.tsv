Hamas hid Mohammed Deif’s body after he was killed in an airstrik...	On several occasions, Hamas denied that Deif was dead. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Kan news reported on Wednesday that Palestinian sources said Hamas hid the body of Mohammed Deif, chief of staff of Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades after he was killed in an airstrike in July. The terror group, on several occasions, denied that Deif was dead. Hamas members discovered Deif's body amid rubble following an airstrike in Al-Mawasi and reportedly buried it in secret. The location of Deif's burial is currently undisclosed, and Hamas is secretive about the location of his grave because they fear Israel will dig him up and use the terror commander's body as a bargaining chip amid hostage negotiations. Previously, Hamas did not announce Deif's death or acknowledge that he was deceased because they were concerned news of his demise 'would break the morale of the fighters in the Gaza Strip.' In August, the IDF acknowledged that its July 13 airstrike killed Mohammed Deif. A day after the strike, Hamas claimed that Deif was 'alive and well,' while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly acknowledged Israel was unsure of Deif's condition. A Hamas courier informed Israeli security forces of the location of top Hamas leader Mohammed Deif and assisted with the assassination, as reported by Saudi media outlet Al Arabiya. Mohammed Deif was the number three Hamas leader after the now-dead Ismail Haniyeh and the current head of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, and with these two, planned the October 7 massacre. Citing a 'responsible security source in Hamas,' the Saudi news outlet reported that the Hamas operative was a courier tasked with passing on communications from Hamas's Rafah Brigade commander Muhammad Shabana to other Hamas leaders. Hamas communicated through the low-tech courier system to avoid having digital messages picked up by Israeli security. The informant and courier who assisted with Deif's assassination is being interrogated by Hamas and revealed details of the operation. An Israeli handler showed the informant a photo of Deif and said to tell him if he ever spotted the Hamas leader. The courier notified the Israeli handler of Deif's whereabouts on July 13, and a strike followed based on this information.

Hamas says it will execute hostages if IDF attempts rescue missio...	Israel‘s Nuseirat rescue operation on June 9 saw Israeli forces free four hostages, who had been held by Hamas since October 2023. By Algemeiner and Reuters Staff The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas said it had information that Israel intended to carry out a hostage rescue operation similar to one conducted in Gaza’s Nuseirat camp in June and threatened to 'neutralize' the captives if any such action took place, according to an internal statement seen by Reuters on Wednesday. In the statement dated Nov. 22, Hamas told its operatives not to consider what the repercussions of following the instructions might be and said it held Israel responsible for the fate of the hostages. The statement, which a senior Hamas source told Reuters was circulated to its factions by the intelligence unit of the group’s military wing Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, did not say when any Israeli operation was expected to take place. There was no immediate Israeli response to the statement. On Wednesday, Israeli media cited Defense Minister Israel Katz as saying pressure on Hamas was increasing and this time 'we will really be able to advance a hostage deal.' Israel‘s Nuseirat rescue operation on June 9 saw Israeli forces free four hostages, who had been held by Hamas since October 2023. In the Hamas statement, the group told its operatives to 'tighten' the living conditions of the captives and said this should be done in accordance with instructions issued after the Nuseirat operation. In a section titled 'recommendations,' Hamas also instructed its operatives to 'activate neutralization orders … as an immediate and swift response to any adventure by the enemy.' Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists kidnapped over 250 hostages during their invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. About 1,200 people were killed in the onslaught, and thousands more were wounded. Israel responded with an ongoing military campaign to its south in Hamas-ruled Gaza to free the hostages and dismantle the terrorist group’s military and governing capabilities. Hamas is still holding 101 hostages — including 97 who were kidnapped amid the Oct 7. atrocities, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Israeli-German hostage’s body retrieved from Gaza for burial	Svirsky, 38, a Tel Aviv resident with dual German-Israeli citizenship, was visiting his elderly parents at Kibbutz Be’eri for Shabbat and the Simchat Torah holiday on Oct. 7, 2023. By JNS Israeli security forces retrieved the remains of slain hostage Itai Svirsky from the Gaza Strip, the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) said in a joint statement on Wednesday night. 'In a Shin Bet operation assisted by the IDF, the body of the hostage Itai Svirsky was brought for burial in Israel from Gaza,' the statement said. Svirsky’s family was said to have been informed on Wednesday after forensics determined that the body was indeed that of the captive. Svirsky, 38, a Tel Aviv resident with dual German-Israeli citizenship, was visiting his elderly parents at Kibbutz Be’eri for Shabbat and the Simchat Torah holiday on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists launched the cross-border raid. Both of his parents were murdered by Hamas. On Jan. 16, the kibbutz announced that Svirsky and fellow hostage Yossi Sharabi were killed in captivity. The confirmation came shortly after Hamas released a propaganda video purporting to show their bodies. An estimated 10% of the 1,100 residents who lived in Be’eri were killed in the Oct. 7 attacks, with an equal number of its residents kidnapped during the murder spree and infiltration of Israel’s southern border. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that followed the announcement on Wednesday, 'The heart breaks at the heavy loss of the Svirsky family, which also lost Itai’s parents, Orit and Rafi of blessed memory, who were murdered in Hamas’s deadly attack.' 'We will continue to take determined and relentless action to return all of our hostages, the living and the deceased,' the Israeli leader vowed.

IDF: Hamas likely murdered six hostages in Khan Yunis	Hamas propaganda has repeatedly accused the IAF of killing hostages during the 14-month-long aerial assault on the Gaza terrorist group. By JNS Hamas terrorists likely executed the six Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered from southern Gaza on Aug. 20, the Israel Defense Forces said on Wednesday following a comprehensive probe. While the military said it was not possible to determine with absolute certainty how Yagev Buchshtab, Alexander Dancyg, Yoram Metzger, Avraham Munder, Haim Peri and Nadav Popplewell were killed, their bodies were found with gunshot wounds, unlike their six guards, who are believed to have died in an Israeli Air Force strike in the area. The army probe noted that investigators were unable to conclude when the hostages were shot—before the strike, during it, or after it. However, the IDF believes the six men would not have survived the airstrike regardless. At the time of the Feb. 14 IAF strike, Jerusalem 'had no information, not even a suspicion, that the hostages were in the underground compound or its vicinity,' according to the statement, which stressed that the strike would have been called off 'had such information been available.' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi presented the final findings of the investigation to the families of the slain hostages on Wednesday. 'In this prolonged war, which began on a very difficult day, the mission of returning the hostages alive accompanies us at every moment,' said Halevi. 'The IDF is confident that the combat advances their return, but in the context of combat we have also made mistakes.' Following the death of the six captives, it was decided that any airstrike meeting 'specific criteria' must be preapproved by the IDF Intelligence Directorate’s Headquarters of the Hostages and Missing Persons. Hamas propaganda has repeatedly accused the IAF of killing hostages during the 14-month-long aerial assault on the Gaza terrorist group. Immediately after the six corpses were recovered from the Hamas tunnel over the summer, their families were informed that bullet fragments were discovered in at least some of their remains. The IDF had determined the deaths of five of the captives several weeks earlier, with only Munder presumed alive until the retrieval operation. At the time, then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant hailed the recovery of the hostages’ bodies as a 'daring and dangerous operation in the Hamas tunnels in Khan Yunis.' And on Aug. 31, Israeli forces in Rafah discovered the bodies of slain hostages Carmel Gat, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, Eden Yerushalmi and IDF Master Sgt. Ori Danino. According to examinations conducted by the L. Greenberg National Institute of Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir in Tel Aviv, the six were shot by their captors multiple times at close range days before their bodies’ discovery, indicating that hostages was executed as Israeli forces closed in on their underground location. Reuters cited an internal Hamas document on Wednesday evening as saying that the terrorist group had indications that the IDF was planning the rescue of multiple hostages, similar to the raid that freed Noa Argamani, Andrey Kozlov, Almog Meir Jan and Shlomi Ziv in June. The confidential document, dated Nov. 22, tells terrorist operatives to execute hostages if such an operation takes place and 'not to consider any repercussions of following the instructions.' Jerusalem believes that 97 of the 251 hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023 assault remain in Gaza after 425 days. Hamas is also holding two civilians who entered Gaza in 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed during 'Operation Protective Edge' in 2014.

IAF launches first haredi aircraft maintenance facility	According to the military, it marks a significant step in integrating haredi men into the military while respecting their religious needs. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces has established its first ultra-Orthodox underground aircraft maintenance facility, for the 'Scorpion' Squadron located at the Ramat David Airbase in the Jezreel Valley. A graduation ceremony was held for 26 Haredi soldiers who completed a Level A Technician Course for F-16 maintenance on Tuesday at the technical base in Haifa, the IDF announced on Wednesday. This initiative, supported by the IDF Manpower Directorate and the Tzurim organization, includes accommodations to maintain a religious lifestyle, such as separate housing, strict kosher standards and a synagogue. According to the military, it marks a significant step in integrating haredi men into the military while respecting their religious needs. JNS reported last month that the IDF plans to form the first company of the Hasmonean Brigade, to be made up of ultra-Orthodox soldiers, by Chanukah, which this year starts on Dec. 25. The IDF wants to capitalize on the symbolism. The Hasmonean Dynasty began after the Jews threw off the yoke of Hellenistic rule in the Maccabean Revolt (167 to 141 BCE) against the Seleucid Empire, liberation that the holiday commemorates. Thirty young men passed the first screenings and dozens of others have expressed interest in serving in the brigade. The army is also looking to make haredi soldiers currently serving in noncombat roles into combat soldiers for the brigade.

‘This could redraw the map of the Middle East’: How Assad’s strug...	The dictator's struggles could, however, provide further opening for Israel to deliver a crushing blow on Tehran. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon With Hezbollah decimated, Iran significantly weakened, and Russia preoccupied with its war on Ukraine, Syrian opposition forces enjoyed ripe conditions for the surprise offensive they launched last week. Those forces are closer than ever to deposing dictator Bashar al-Assad, experts told the Washington Free Beacon, emphasizing the Iranian regime's ever-loosening grip on the Middle East. The reignited Syrian war, which has dragged on for 13 years, will pose fresh challenges for the incoming Trump administration as it grapples with a Middle East already inflamed by a year of war between Israel and Iran-backed forces across the region. It is this very conflict, regional analysts and former U.S. national security officials say, that set the stage for Syria’s armed rebel forces to reclaim Aleppo, a key stronghold, and set their sites on the capital city, Damascus. The key player in the coming battle for control of Syria is Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is backing anti-Assad forces and likely played a role in initiating their stunning offensive. These forces are primarily composed of Islamist militias controlled by Hayʼat Tahrir ash-Sham, a U.S.-designated terror group. On the other side is Assad, a brutal dictator who relies on support from Iran and Russia. 'For years, Iran dominated Syria through Assad, but Erdogan saw an opening with a weakened Iran and Hezbollah thanks to Israeli operations,' said Simone Ledeen, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East. 'By supporting Islamist networks, Turkey is pushing to fill the vacuum left by Iran’s decline. This could redraw the map of the Middle East.' Still, Assad's decline would by no means lead to a friendly replacement for the United States. The Syrian conflict is 'the Middle East equivalent of Alien vs Predator,' Foundation for Defense of Democracies analyst Jonathan Schanzer said. 'All of the players are bad actors with terrorist, anti-American, or anti-Israel agendas.' The dictator's struggles could, however, provide further opening for Israel to deliver a crushing blow on Tehran. Iran is reportedly dispatching scores of fighters to Syria to combat the rebel forces, and its air defenses are already decimated thanks to Israel's October counterstrike on the Islamic Republic. Amid the chaos, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu could see an opportunity to strike Tehran again, 'including the nuclear program,' according to former White House national security adviser John Bolton. That option remains 'still on the table,' he said. 'It’s still the regime in Tehran,' Bolton said. 'That’s what the threat is. Assad is a manifestation of that threat.' With Syrian opposition forces now closing in on Damascus following the siege of Aleppo and ensuing battles in other towns, analysts are just beginning to digest how Israel’s war against Hamas and Hezbollah has fundamentally reshaped the region. 'The Israelis have helped change and weaken those players' who back Assad, according to former U.S. ambassador to Syria Robert Ford, who discussed the situation during a Tuesday briefing hosted by the Middle East Institute. Since last week’s march on Aleppo, for example, the Israelis reportedly intercepted an Iranian supply plane heading to Damascus, further underscoring Tehran’s weakened hand. At this early stage in the conflict, Erdogan’s Turkey has the most to gain, potentially extracting territorial concessions from Assad and his Russian allies, according to Bolton. Moscow, however, is chiefly concerned about its two military bases in Syria, which give the Russians leverage over the region. While it’s unclear what Syria will look like in the coming months, one possibility could see Erdogan’s Turkey 'controlling Islamist forces in one part and Russia clinging to an enclave of Christian communities in another,' Ledeen, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense, told the Free Beacon. As the Middle East undergoes monumental shifts, the United States has largely sat on the sidelines. 'One of the most troubling aspects of this moment is that we’re watching tectonic plates shift, yet there’s no visible effort—or even apparent desire—to shape these outcomes to our benefit,' Ledeen said. 'This moment is a test of American resolve, and our adversaries are closely watching. Iran is emboldened, Russia and China are taking notes, and our allies are growing increasingly uneasy.'

Israel begins reopening northern national parks after year-long c...	Teams are still inspecting trails for potential hazards, such as missile debris, and visitors are warned not to touch any suspicious objects they may encounter and to report such findings immediately to the authorities. By Pesach Benson, TPS National parks and reserves in northern Israel began reopening to the public on Wednesday for the first time in a year since Hezbollah rocket barrages forced their closure. 'The opening of the nature sites and parks in the north is an exciting and hopeful moment for all of us. After a difficult year of constant fighting and many challenges, the opportunity to once again travel through the spectacular landscapes of the north is a ray of light of a renewed connection to our nature, land and heritage,' said Environmental Protection Minister Idit Silman. The first wave of reopened sites includes Baram National Park, Hula Nature Reserve, Achziv National Park, Yechiam National Park, Tel Hazor National Park, Nahal Amud Nature Reserve, and Nimrod Fortress National Park. Other sites, such as the Ein Afek and Tel Dan nature reserves, will remain closed for restoration and safety assessments. The reopening is being carried out under Home Front Command guidelines. Teams are still inspecting trails for potential hazards, such as missile debris and visitors are warned not to touch any suspicious objects they may encounter and to report such findings immediately to the authorities. 'Going out to nature reserves and national parks allows us to disconnect from routine and connect with the beauty of Israeli nature,' said Raya Shurki, Director General of the Nature and Parks Authority. Among the sites reopening are the Hula Nature Reserve, known for its wetlands and is popular for birdwatchers. Tel Hazor National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to the ruins of the biblical city of Hazor. Nimrod Fortress National Park, on the slopes of Mount Hermon, features the impressive ruins of a medieval fortress. And Baram National Park, located in the Upper Galilee, features well-preserved ancient ruins of a Roman-era village. But the reopening of the parks is bittersweet for the Authority. One of its workers, Ohad Yahalomi, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz home on October 7. A dual US-Israeli national, Yahalomi turned 50 while in captivity. Fires sparked by the barrages have scorched forests that are home to rare and endangered wildlife. In the 14 months since Hamas’s October 7 attack, Hezbollah fired more than 16,500 rockets, killing 77 people and injuring approximately 757. Wildfires sparked by the barrages burnt around 230 million square meters of land. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel were displaced from their homes.

UN calls for conference to advance Palestinian state	The conference will take place in New York on June 2-4, with a preparatory meeting to be held in May. By JNS The United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday passed a resolution calling for a 'High-level International Conference' to be held in June to push forward the establishment of a State of Palestine. The conference will advance implementation of U.N. resolutions regarding 'the question of Palestine,' reads the resolution, one of three passed on Tuesday concerning the two-state solution. The conference will take place in New York on June 2-4, with a preparatory meeting to be held in May. It will adopt an 'outcome document' that will outline 'an irreversible pathway towards the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution.' The resolution also calls for the convening of an international conference in Moscow, as envisioned by a 2008 Security Council resolution, to bring about the goal of two states as part of 'a just, lasting and comprehensive peace settlement.' The resolution characterizes Israel as an 'occupying power' and demands it end its presence in Judea, Samaria and eastern Jerusalem, what it terms 'Occupied Palestinian Territory,' as reflected in the July 19 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The resolution also demanded that Israel cease all new 'settlement' activities and evacuate all 'settlers' from those areas. The General Assembly resolution was passed with 157 votes in favor, eight against (Argentina, Hungary, Israel, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, United States) and seven abstentions (Cameroon, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Georgia, Paraguay, Ukraine, Uruguay).

Annexation plan not a deal-breaker for Saudi deal, says ex-Trump ...	Deputy National Security Advisor from first Trump administration says president-elect will push new policies vis-a-vis Iran, the Palestinian Authority, and the Abraham Accords. By Anna Epshtein, TPS A former advisor to Donald Trump promised on Monday that the President-elect will change policies towards Iran, the Palestinians and normalization with Arab states. 'Oslo failed. We need a paradigm shift,' said Victoria Coates, former Deputy National Security Advisor during Trump’s first presidency. 'This rigid formula of the two-state solution in the last thirty years has got us nowhere,' Coates insisted. The Oslo Accords of 1993, she said, were 'well-intentioned, but didn’t work.' 'It is Israel’s and Palestinians’ business now to figure out a solution.' Coates was invited by the Jerusalem-based Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy to present her new book The Battle for the Jewish State about Israel-US relations. She speculated that the incoming Trump administration will take a harder line on Iran. 'Trump said after October 1 that Israel should hit Iran’s nuclear and energy sites. This is not something he used to say previously, and I don’t think he said it lightly.' Israel retaliated for Iran’s October 1 missile barrage with airstrikes on the Islamic Republic’s air defenses, missile production facilities and a nuclear research site. Coates also mentioned that the incoming Trump administration will likely harden sanctions on Iran. Asked about possible normalization between Israel and moderate Arab countries, Coates said she believed the Abraham Accords still have the potential to be expanded. 'I would leave the details for negotiations, but it is clear to me that the veto that the Palestinians have held since essentially 1973 over the foreign policy decisions, particularly of our Gulf partners and allies, that veto no longer holds,' Coates said. She added that Israeli sovereignty over parts Judea and Samaria would not necessarily deter Saudi Arabia from normalizing ties. 'I don’t see it as a deal-breaker for Saudi Arabia if it is not a deal-breaker for Washington,' she asserted. 'I would rather pay attention to what the Saudis do than to what they say.' The Abraham accords, signed in September 2021, normalized relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Morocco joined the accords in December. Sudan, which signed the Abraham accords in January 2021, has not made any moves to normalize ties, keeping relations focused on security and intelligence cooperation. Israel and Saudi Arabia were moving closer to normalizing ties before the diplomacy was disrupted by Hamas’s October 7 attack.

Israel headed to civil war if court ousts Netanyahu, minister war...	Israeli government minister David Amsalem warns that attempts by the judiciary to remove Netanyahu from office would spark an Israeli civil war. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli government minister and member of the ruling Likud party warned Wednesday that any attempt by the judiciary to force Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu out of office, including any attempt to declare him incapable of fulfilling his duties as premier, would likely spark violence and possibly even lead to an Israeli civil war. Speaking with Galei Yisrael radio on Wednesday, Regional Cooperation Minister David Amsalem ruled out the possibility of the Supreme Court ousting Netanyahu, saying that public outrage would be overpowering should the judiciary attempt to declare the prime minister unfit to serve. 'That won't happen, we won't let it happen,' said Amsalem. 'I suppose we can make the judges stay clear of such a place and we can do other things so that the public will act spontaneously.' However, should the court attempt to force the issue, Amsalem continued, popular resistance to the move would likely turn violent. 'In my opinion, that already would be a coup d'etat par excellence, and it would lead to a civil war.' When asked whether he would back the use of armed force by citizens in such a situation, Amsalem responded: 'No, not with guns. That would lead to physical confrontations between citizens. Not with guns. That could escalate to that at some later stage.' Amsalem advocated for civil disobedience and protests, should the courts attempt to force Netanyahu out of office. 'It's possible also to do other things, like preventing judges from entering their chambers; people could come and barricade the entrance. You can always escalate to the next stage, and then the next stage after that.'

In major reversal, Australia calls for full Israeli withdrawal fr...	Ending nearly quarter century of policy, Australia backs UN resolution demanding Israel withdraw from all of Judea and Samaria, along with eastern Jerusalem, and establish Palestinian state including Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Australia's mission to the United Nations broke with nearly a quarter center of policy Tuesday night to vote in favor of a United Nations resolution demanding Israel halt all settlement activity in Judea and Samaria, and to withdraw completely from the area, as well as Jerusalem, and to agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state. The resolution was passed in the UN General Assembly Tuesday night by a margin of 157 to 8, with 7 abstentions, with Israel, the U.S., Hungary, and Argentina among the dissenters. Prior to Tuesday's vote, Australia had hitherto refused to back such measures at the United Nations, alternating between abstaining and openly opposing resolutions. From 1996 to 2000, however, the Howard government voted in favor of such measures. The Australian government, under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, refused to back a similar resolution in September, with Australia's delegation abstaining. Now, however, Foreign Minister Penny Wong's office said that Canberra decided to back the measure, believing its vote in favor could 'contribute to peace and a two-state solution.' James Larsen, Australia's ambassador to the United Nations, defended the about-face, calling Palestinian statehood the 'only hope' for peace in the Middle East. 'A two-state solution remains the only hope of breaking the endless cycle of violence – the only hope to see a secure and prosperous future for both peoples.' The decision to back the resolution drew fire from Australian Jewish groups and the center-right Liberal party. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton castigated the move, accusing Prime Minister Albanese of having 'sold out' Australia's Jewish population in favor of far-left voters. Last month, Australia sparked out controversy, and drew criticism from the Israeli government, after it refused to grant an entry visa to former Israeli government minister Ayelet Shaked, citing her stances on the Gaza war and Palestinian statehood.

France, Saudis to spearhead summit pushing for Palestinian stateh...	United Nations votes to call for conference in 2025 to advance Palestinian statehood, with France and Saudi Arabia announcing plans to head up the summit. By World Israel News Staff France and Saudi Arabia will cohost a conference next year aimed at securing a pathway to the establishment of a Palestinian state, French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday night. 'We have decided to co-chair a conference for the two states in June next year,' Macron said Tuesday night. 'In the coming months, together we will multiply and combine our diplomatic initiatives to bring everyone along this path,' he continued. The announcement came shortly after the United Nations General Assembly voted 157 to 8 in favor of a resolution calling for a full Israeli withdrawal from Judea, Samaria, and eastern Jerusalem - including the Old City of Jerusalem - the establishment of a Palestinian state, and a conference at UN headquarters next June to promote Palestinian statehood. A day before the announcement, President Macron met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, during which the two leaders signed a strategic partnership agreement. When asked by reporters Tuesday night whether France would recognize Palestinian statehood unilaterally, Macron responded that his government would recognize a Palestinian state 'at the right moment', 'when it triggers reciprocal movements of recognition.' 'We want to involve several other partners and allies, both European and non-European, who are ready to move in this direction but who are waiting for France.' Macron hinted that he also would reserve recognition for a broader peace deal, possibly one including Saudi Arabia, for Arab recognition of Israel, saying his government hoped to 'trigger a movement of recognition in favor of Israel,' and 'provide answers in terms of security for Israel and convince people that the two-state solution is a solution that is relevant for Israel.'

UN demands Israel withdraw from Old City of Jerusalem, Judea and ...	United Nations General Assembly resolution passed by overwhelming majority calls on Israel to withdraw from all areas captured in 1967, including eastern Jerusalem. By World Israel News Staff The United Nations General Assembly voted to pass a resolution Tuesday night demanding the establishment of a Palestinian state, and Israel's withdrawal from all territories secured in the 1967 Six Day War in Judea, Samaria, and Jerusalem. The measure was passed by a majority of 157 to 8 with 7 abstentions. The United States, Israel, Argentina, and Hungary were among the countries voting against the resolution. Tuesday's resolution includes plans for a 'High-Level International Conference' to be held at UN headquarters in New York next June, with the goal of adopting an 'action-oriented outcome document' paving the way for Palestinian statehood. In the resolution, the UN General Assembly called on Israel to withdraw 'from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem,' and to enable the establishment of a Palestinian state along the pre-1967 Green Line demarcating the 1949 armistice border between Israel and Jordan. Israel is furthermore ordered to halt all 'settlement activities,' and to enter into negotiations with the Palestinian Authority to address final status issues. The resolution cited the July 19th, 2024 ruling of the International Court of Justice, the United Nations official judicial body, which found Israel's presence in Judea and Samaria to be illegal under international law. Turning to Israel's war against the Hamas terror organization, Tuesday's resolution also forbade Israel to encourage mass voluntary Arab emigration, as proposed by several Israeli ministers, and emphasized that the Gaza Strip must be part of a future Palestinian state. The UN rejects 'any attempt at demographic or territorial change in the Gaza Strip, including any actions that reduce the territory of Gaza, stresses that the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the Palestinian territory occupied in 1967, and reaffirms the vision of the two-State solution, with the Gaza Strip as part of the Palestinian State.' The resolution also reiterated the UN's rejection of Israel's application of sovereignty over eastern Jerusalem in 1967.

Hamas, PA officials leave Cairo without agreement on ‘day after’ ...	Senior P.A. official Jibril Rajoub told reporters in Ramallah on Tuesday that he did not favor any agreement to create separate political systems in the Gaza Strip, Judea, and Samaria. By JNS Palestinian Authority and Hamas representatives have left Egypt without signing an expected agreement on joint management of the Gaza Strip after the war with Israel, multiple sources reported on Tuesday night. Earlier on Tuesday, negotiators from both sides told AFP that Hamas and the P.A.’s ruling Fatah Party were close to creating a committee of up to 15 'nonpartisan' Palestinians who would administer the enclave. The officials claimed the plan would follow a truce deal with Jerusalem. The draft agreement, a copy of which was seen by the press agency, states that the committee would administer the Gaza side of the Rafah Crossing with Egypt. However, senior P.A. official Jibril Rajoub was quoted as telling reporters in Ramallah on Tuesday that he did not favor any agreement to create separate political systems in the Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria. 'What committee is this? It is wrong to even discuss this issue,' said Rajoub. 'We want one government, one security apparatus and one unified policy. Any discussion or effort outside of this framework is a mistake.' Meanwhile, a Palestinian source familiar with the talks told Sky News Arabia on Tuesday evening that 'there are still obstacles to signing the agreement, including the ‘security file’ and the crossings of Gaza.' The source claimed that Hamas is trying to ensure that members of both its civil and military apparatus would continue to receive salaries after the P.A.-led committee assumed control of the coastal enclave. The delegations, led by Turkey-based Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya and Fatah Central Committee member Azzam al-Ahmad, reportedly left to formulate their responses to the Egyptian draft. An Egyptian source had previously claimed that Hamas was willing to accept that it would not be the sole ruler in Gaza, in light of Cairo’s demand that P.A. control be restored to advance a possible two-state solution. On Sept. 25, P.A. Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa announced that Fatah had agreed to sit down with Hamas in Egypt. Mustafa said the discussion would focus on forging initial deals 'to arrange the situation' in Gaza. He expressed his 'readiness to administer the Gaza Strip the day after the war without excluding anyone,' local media reported. In July, Hamas and Fatah announced a unity deal following talks in Beijing. The declaration was approved by 14 terrorist factions that took part in negotiations hosted by Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister. 'Today, we sign an agreement, and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity,' Hamas official Musa Abu Marzouk said at the time. 'We are committed to national unity, and we call for it.' The U.S. State Department, which has been pushing for P.A. control over the Strip after the war, has rejected a government that includes Hamas. 'Hamas has long been a terrorist organization. They have the blood of innocent civilians—both Israeli and Palestinian—on their hands,' State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters in Washington in July. 'There can’t be a role for a terrorist organization.' Secretary of State Antony Blinken has insisted that an 'effective and revitalized Palestinian Authority' should govern Gaza—a move that Israel rejects because of Ramallah’s overt support for terrorism. Jerusalem vehemently rejects Hamas and P.A. rule over the Strip, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu favoring a transfer of control to local bodies not considered hostile to the Jewish state. Netanyahu said during an interview that aired on May 9 that Israel is seeking to establish a rule 'by Gazans who are not committed to our destruction, possibly with the aid of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and other countries that I think want to see stability and peace.' According to recent polls of Palestinian public opinion, 89% of Palestinians support establishing a government that includes or is led by Hamas. Only 8.5% said they favor an authority that is controlled exclusively by the Fatah faction.

Ancient agricultural innovation offers hope for future sustainabi...	SGHAS systems offer a low-impact approach to farming that aligns with contemporary goals of environmental stewardship and climate resilience. By Pesach Benson, TPS As the world grapples with escalating water scarcity and food insecurity, a groundbreaking study led by Bar-Ilan University and the Israel Antiquities Authority released on Wednesday has uncovered sustainable agricultural techniques from the early Islamic period that may hold the key to a more resilient future. The research focuses on traditional sunken groundwater-harvesting agroecosystems (SGHAS), which were once prevalent in regions such as Israel, Iran, Algeria, Egypt, Gaza, and the Atlantic coast of Iberia. Combining geospatial analysis, archaeological evidence, and historical documentation, the study reveals how these innovative systems harnessed limited water resources and enriched sandy soils to sustain agriculture in arid environments — a model that the researchers say remains relevant today. The practical applications revolve around simply leveraging ancient agricultural methods to address modern challenges of water scarcity, soil degradation, and food insecurity. At the heart of the study is the Plot-and-Berm (P&B) agricultural method, developed during the late 9th to early 12th centuries along Israel’s Mediterranean coast. These systems utilized shallow groundwater in conjunction with rainfall to irrigate crops, while organic materials and urban refuse were used to enhance the fertility of sandy soils. This enabled the cultivation of water-intensive crops like dates, watermelons, and grapes in otherwise barren regions. Although P&B systems were abandoned in Israel after the Crusader conquest, similar techniques have persisted in other regions, such as Iran, Algeria, and parts of Iberia. 'The early Islamic agroecosystems were ahead of their time, blending advanced soil-enrichment techniques with efficient water usage. While we lack direct records of their crops or motivations, the ingenuity of these systems remains a powerful lesson in sustainable agriculture,' said the study’s co-leader, Prof. Joel Roskin of Bar-Ilan. The findings suggest that such methods could be adapted to modern socio-economic and environmental contexts, particularly in areas facing expanding populations and diminishing water supplies. The study noted the potential of SGHAS as a sustainable alternative to resource-intensive industrial farming. Unlike modern systems that often deplete soil quality and overuse water resources, these traditional techniques promote ecological balance and long-term viability. By relying on rainfall-replenished groundwater, SGHAS systems offer a low-impact approach to farming that aligns with contemporary goals of environmental stewardship and climate resilience. They also foster community engagement, as such methods often require local expertise and collective management. 'Traditional methods cannot replace industrial farming entirely but provide invaluable lessons for creating locally adaptive, sustainable food systems,'* said Dr. Itamar Taxel of the Israel Antiquities Authority.

Trump to prioritize hostage release, pressure on Iran, Saudi peac...	The new president still actively wants to achieve peace in the region, says new Middle East adviser Massad Boulos. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump is still interested in achieving peace in the Middle East using ideas from his first administration, such as putting maximum pressure on Iran and expanding the Abraham Accords, but the first order of business is to free the 101 Hamas hostages, his new Middle East adviser said in an interview Tuesday. Speaking to French paper Le Point, Massad Boulos said, 'The president believes that the hostages must be released immediately and that there must be no further delay. According to him, their fate should not be linked to other issues related to the ‘day after’ in Gaza.' The deal should come on the basis of a temporary ceasefire, he added. This idea would put Trump squarely on the Israeli side of the on-again, off-again negotiations with Hamas. One of Hamas’ most entrenched demands has been that any agreement with Israel be contingent on the IDF permanently and wholly withdrawing from the Strip. Jerusalem has consistently rejected this due to its security concerns. Boulos mentioned several countries that 'are currently helping to achieve this goal, whether it is Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, or even Turkey.' Turkey has been thrown into the mix because it now has more influence over Hamas, considering that it took over from Qatar as host to the terror organization’s leaders in recent weeks, he noted, although Doha should remain the chief mediator in the negotiations. Qatar has supplied Hamas with billions of dollars over the years, giving it a cudgel it has yet to use in over a year of warfare. In the larger picture, aimed at establishing peace in the region, the Lebanese-American businessman said that Trump will prioritize the resumption of 'discussions on the Abraham Accords, with, of course, Saudi Arabia first. Because we know very well, and the president has said so, that once we reach an agreement with Saudi Arabia on Israel, there will be at least twelve Arab countries that will be immediately ready to follow suit.' According to Boulos, the Saudis were not demanding the establishment of a Palestinian state in order to normalize relations with Israel. This view seems somewhat at odds with statements coming from the royal family as the war has progressed. The de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said in September that 'the kingdom will not stop its tireless work towards the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and we affirm that the kingdom will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that.' In terms of Iran, Boulos stated that Trump will reinstate his firm line against the Islamic Republic. While negotiating on the nuclear issue was an option, he said, 'maximum pressure' would be brought to bear as 'there are three very important points for him: Iran must absolutely not have nuclear power; Iran's ballistic missiles pose a risk not only to Israel, but also to the Gulf countries; and finally, the problem posed by Iranian proxies in the region, whether in Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq or Yemen.' Boulos became close to Trump after his son Michael’s 2022 marriage to Tiffany Trump, the only child from Trump’s second marriage, to actress Marla Maples. The billionaire became an integral part of Trump’s campaign for president by doing outreach to the American Muslim and Arab communities. He has reportedly served in recent months as the main conduit between Trump and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, arranging, according to Axios, the first phone call between the two after Trump was re-elected.

IDF fears that soldiers who fought in Gaza face arrest abroad	The Israeli military is concerned that soldiers may be detained or face prosecution in foreign countries. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli army is concerned that IDF soldiers who recently fought in Gaza may be arrested while traveling abroad, and is taking steps to prevent soldiers from visiting countries where they could potentially be detained. Following the ICC arrest warrants issued against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ex-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza, numerous anti-Israel organizations have stepped up their campaign against Israeli soldiers. The pro-Hamas Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) regularly stalks Israeli soldiers online, revealing their full names and posting their photos to its X account when they travel outside of Israel. The HRF then encourages the governments of the countries where IDF soldiers are visiting to arrest them, citing their supposed complicity in alleged human rights violations. Recently, the HRF claimed that it 'filed a formal complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC)' against an Israeli soldier who was traveling in another country, including the man's full name and photograph was included in the post. The HRF then demanded that the government of the country where the soldier was traveling arrest him, due to his alleged involvement in 'genocide' and 'crimes against humanity.' While some may dismiss the posts as unsophisticated public shaming, the Israeli army takes the matter seriously, and is concerned that soldiers may be detained or face prosecution in foreign countries. According to a report from Hebrew language outlet Ynet, recent weeks have seen a number of incidents in which IDF soldiers traveling outside of the country were doxxed (had their personal details exposed) by anti-Israel groups. Ynet reported that the military was so concerned over potential legal ramifications that it provided special assistance to the soldiers, ensuring they could leave the countries and return to Israel s quickly as possible. Although IDF soldiers are not officially banned from leaving Israel, they are required to inform the military of their destination country prior to traveling abroad. The army then performs a risk assessment, taking into consideration anti-Israel laws in said countries, before approving or denying the travel.

ICC sexual harassment probe marred by conflict of interest	The UN agency, which is expected to investigate the sexual harassment claims against ICC prosecutor Karim Khan, employed his wife for two years. By World Israel News Staff The announcement of a probe into alleged sexual harassment by the International Criminal Court's head prosecutor has raised concerns over a possible conflict of interest, as the agency expected to investigate the claims has extensive ties to the prosecutor's wife. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan groped a female aide on multiple occasions, 'sexually touching her' on a work trip and knocking on the door of her hotel room at 3 a.m., according to the account of the alleged victim. The female ICC staff member refused to cooperate with an internal ICC investigation into the matter, saying that she believed the investigation was designed to exonerate Khan and that she did not want to lend legitimacy to the biased process. According to an AP report, Päivi Kaukoranta, a Finnish diplomat, said last week that Khan would be investigated by the U.N.'s Office of Internal Oversight Services. That decision has raised serious concerns over whether the body could be objective, as Khan's wife, Dato Shyamala Alagendra, worked for that agency for two years. Notably, Alagendra - also an attorney - investigated sexual harassment claims as part of her work with the agency. Two human rights groups, the International Federation for Human Rights and Women’s Initiatives for Gender Justice, issued a joint statement urging that Khan be suspended while the allegations are investigated and questioning the choice of the UN agency to investigate. The groups called for 'thoroughly vetting the chosen investigative body, firm, or institution to ensure it is free from conflicts of interest and possesses demonstrated expertise.' They also stressed that Khan's 'close relationship' with the agency was problematic, and that concerns over conflict of interest be 'openly and transparently addressed' before the agency is officially tasked with handling the investigation against him. Although the ICC officially maintains a zero-tolerance policy on sexual harassment, many employees feel there is a culture of impunity within the organization for senior employees. In 2020, external investigators wrote a report about predatory behavior by senior staff towards female employees. 'There is a general reluctance, if not extreme fear, among many staff to report any alleged act of misconduct or misbehavior' by senior officials, read the report. 'The perception is that they are all immune.'

Google worried by backlash over Israeli gov’t contract	A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company's services to Israel were not used for military purposes. By World Israel News Staff Tech titan Google fretted that agreeing to provide cloud services to the Israeli government would damage its reputation, and those concerns have been exacerbated by recent employee protests over the contract, according to a new report from the New York Times. In 2021, Google announced Project Nimbus, an ambitious initiative aimed at transitioning many Israel government ministries' databases to the cloud. The seven year deal is worth $1.26 billion, with a large portion of that money - $528 million - coming from Israel's Defense Ministry. While publicly Google has claimed that it has no qualms about partnering with Israel, documents recently obtained by the Times revealed that Google's senior leadership were worried that the deal would create negative publicity for the technology giant. According to a risk assessment document prepared by Google's lawyers and external consultants before the deal was signed, advisors feared that the inclusion of Israel's Defense Ministry and the Israeli Security Agency could prove problematic. 'Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations' read the document, which was viewed by the Times. A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company's services to Israel were not used for military purposes. 'We have been very clear that the Nimbus contract is for workloads running on our commercial cloud by Israeli government ministries, who agree to comply with our terms of service and acceptable use policy,' she said. Anti-Israel activism by Google employees has been ongoing since the deal was signed in 2021. In April 2024, Google fired 28 employees who staged raucous sit-ins at the company's Sunnyvale and New York offices. The demonstrators, who refused to leave CEO Thomas Kurian's office, were participating in a 'No Tech for Genocide Day of Action.' 'They took over office spaces, defaced our property, and physically impeded the work of other Googlers,' the company’s vice president of global security, Chris Rackow, wrote in a company-wide memo. 'Their behavior was unacceptable, extremely disruptive, and made co-workers feel threatened.'

EXCLUSIVE: The fierce battle to protect Montreal’s Jewish communi...	While Montreal burned, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was notably absent from the crisis, attending a Taylor Swift concert. By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News Montreal is no stranger to antisemitism, but since October 7, the hostility against Jewish communities has reached alarming levels. From violent protests targeting synagogues and Jewish-owned businesses to direct threats of physical harm, the environment for Jews in Montreal has become increasingly dangerous. Anti-Israel protest near Mcgill University, Montreal, Canada. (Screenshot/Facebook) Yet, amidst the chaos, Jewish leaders, students, and activists are responding with resilience, legal action, and a firm commitment to their identity. At the forefront of this fight for justice are individuals like Michael Hollander, a commercial lawyer who has coordinated high-profile cases to defend Jewish institutions; Neil Oberman, a lawyer and the Conservative candidate for Mount Royal who has represented key cases in court; and Ysabella Elisheva Hazan, a young law graduate and activist advocating for open dialogue in the face of intimidation. Together, they represent a community fighting not only for its safety but for its right to exist unapologetically. A City at Boiling Point The rise in antisemitism in Montreal is no longer confined to rhetoric—it’s spilling into the streets. On November 29, a man entered a Jewish-owned business and shouted a tirade of threats, declaring, 'We’re gonna kill you one by one!' The incident was caught on video, and while a police report was filed, no arrests have been made. Anti-Israel protestor setting fire to effigy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during anti-Israel riot in Montreal, Friday, November 22, 2024 (Nioh Berg/X) This incident follows a violent pro-Palestinian riot in Montreal, where demonstrators set fire to an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, smashed store windows, and torched vehicles. These events are far from protests—they are hate-fueled rallies that incite violence. While Montreal burned, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was notably absent from the crisis, attending a Taylor Swift concert. His presence at the concert sent a starkly different message to the Jewish community and to Canadians at large about the priorities of the country’s leadership during a moment of rising tension and violence. Although Trudeau condemned the riots days later, stating, 'Acts of antisemitism, intimidation, and violence must be condemned wherever we see them,' his earlier statement that he would arrest Netanyahu if he visited Canada undermined his credibility. For many, these mixed messages embolden antisemitic actors who view Jewish identity as inseparable from the Jewish state. The Legal Battle: Protecting the Community As antisemitic hostility mounts, Michael Hollander has taken on a central role in coordinating legal protections for Montreal’s Jewish institutions. Montreal4Palestine poster at McGill (Courtesy) Hollander and Neil Oberman collaborated on obtaining an injunction to protect Federation CJA, Montreal’s largest Jewish organization, after hostile groups including Montreal4Palestine, Independent Jewish Voices, and the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) laid siege to its building on March 4, 2024. Protesters blocked the doors for hours, vandalized the property, assaulted attendees, and chanted, 'Death to the Jews.' The injunction, which Oberman represented in court, was later expanded to protect 27 Jewish institutions, including synagogues, schools, and community centers. These institutions now have a 50-meter buffer zone, offering a measure of safety from similar attacks. Hollander played a key role in coordinating efforts to ensure legal action was effective and consistent throughout this period. 'These aren’t protests—they are literal hate rallies meant to intimidate and silence,' Hollander explained. 'In 2024, Jews shouldn’t have to navigate this level of hostility just to attend school or synagogue.' The Legal Climate in Montreal Despite these challenges, Hollander noted that the courts have been largely receptive to cases addressing antisemitism. 'The courts have consistently shown they are ready to come to the aid of those who need it,' he said. However, he emphasized that obstacles often stem from administrative bodies and inconsistent enforcement of laws. 'Institutions like the Human Rights Commission have proven ineffective in addressing these issues,' Hollander explained. 'It’s not the courts that fail us—it’s the inconsistent application of the law by those tasked with upholding it.' Notable Moments in the Fight Hollander shared several pivotal moments from his work: • At the Spanish &#038; Portuguese Synagogue, Hollander coordinated efforts while Oberman represented in court to secure protections against another planned hate rally targeting the synagogue. • Deposing individuals from hate groups revealed their unwillingness to acknowledge the humanity of Jewish people, with one leader refusing to even shake his hand. • Supporting a Muslim student who faced threats for defending Jewish classmates underscored the shared stakes in combating hatred and extremism. 'These moments remind me how crucial our legal system is,' Hollander reflected. 'The stakes are not just about individual safety—they are about the community as a whole.' A Call for Leadership and Lawful Governance McGill University in Montreal (Shutterstock) As the challenges facing Jewish students and communities continue to mount, Neil Oberman, a lawyer and the Conservative candidate for Mount Royal, has emphasized the urgent need for decisive leadership at every level of government and within institutions. Oberman articulated his stance, stating: 'It is imperative that university administrators prioritize the safety of their students during their educational pursuits. There must be a strict zero-tolerance policy for any form of hatred or aggression on campus. My colleagues and I are committed to reinstating law and order in Montreal, as a secure environment is essential for effective learning.' He pointed to ineffective leadership at municipal, federal, and institutional levels as a key contributor to the rise in campus hostility, adding: 'In a society that values freedom and democracy, individuals should not feel apprehensive about leaving their homes, attending classes, or utilizing public facilities.' Oberman further outlined his vision for addressing these issues after the upcoming election cycle: 'Alongside Pierre Poilievre and the Conservative Party of Canada, we aspire to rejuvenate our nation after nine years of Liberal-NDP governance that has weakened our fundamental institutions and distorted public perceptions of Canada.' Oberman stressed that the current challenges are rooted in longstanding issues that predate the October 7th crisis. He criticized Ottawa’s ineffective leadership, stating that mixed messages from the federal government have sown confusion and allowed extremists to exploit the lack of clarity to propagate hateful ideologies. 'Such behavior will no longer be tolerated under a Conservative Party administration,' Oberman affirmed. 'Our communities cannot thrive if individuals driven by hate impede others from living freely each day. Only through collaboration with responsible Canadians and reforming our institutional frameworks can we hope to restore safety across Canada.' A Collective Stand Against Antisemitism Thousands of Jews gather in Montreal for the 'March for Jerusalem.' (Twitter Screenshot) Recognizing the need for broader community assistance, Hollander and a few colleagues helped establish the Quebec Legal Jewish Alliance. Comprising 300 lawyers, this organization provides legal services for less high-profile but equally critical cases. It assists students, teachers, employees, and others in Montreal who face antisemitism but may not have the resources to consult a lawyer. 'There’s a high volume of incidents in Montreal right now,' Hollander said. 'The Alliance steps in where individuals might otherwise feel powerless.' Oberman also represented two Jewish students at McGill University in a case against the McGill Encampment. While the case was ultimately unsuccessful, it underscored the extent of hostility faced by Jewish students on campus. Hollander continues to provide support on related issues and highlighted his ongoing lawsuit against Concordia University, which underscores the institutional failure to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence. Advocating for Dialogue: Ysabella Hazan’s Perspective While Hollander focuses on legal advocacy, activists like Ysabella Elisheva Hazan are addressing antisemitic narratives in the public sphere. A law graduate and founder of Decolonized Judean, an empowerment movement, Hazan has become a vocal advocate for Jewish empowerment and open dialogue. Hazan was scheduled to speak at an event at McGill University alongside Mosab Hassan Yousef, also known as the 'Son of Hamas.' However, after significant opposition and even death threats, McGill canceled all in-person events for the remainder of the year. While the event never took place, Hazan’s message remains clear: dialogue and resilience are the antidotes to suppression. 'Anti-colonial tactics of resistance won’t work on Jews, an indigenous people to Israel,' Hazan explained. 'The sooner this is understood, the quicker we can create meaningful dialogue and reduce polarization.' A Call to Action The resilience of Montreal’s Jewish community serves as a powerful reminder of the strength that comes from unity and determination. The fight against antisemitism requires more than legal victories or public advocacy—it demands a cultural shift. As Trudeau partied at a concert while Montreal burned, the question remains: will Canada rise to protect its Jewish citizens, or will it allow this wave of hatred to grow unchecked? For now, the Jewish community in Montreal continues to fight—with the courts, with their voices, and with their unwavering commitment to their identity. This is not just a battle for survival—it is a fight to affirm their place as equal members of Canadian society.

Hostage families thank Trump for his robust ultimatum demanding r...	The Hostages and Missing Families Forum: 'It is now evident to all: the time has come. We must bring them home NOW.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Hostages and Missing Families Forum praised US president-elect Donald Trump for saying that there would be 'hell to pay' if the hostages aren't release by the time he takes office on January 20. 'The Hostage Families Forum extends its gratitude to President-elect Trump for his clear and uncompromising message. It is now evident to all: the time has come. We must bring them home NOW,' the forum said. 'We call on both the current and incoming US administrations to act without delay and exhaust every opportunity to bring all the hostages home—those alive for rehabilitation, and those murdered for proper burial.' On Monday, Donald Trump demanded that all hostages be released by the time he takes office on January 20, or there would be 'Hell to pay.' 'Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World in the Middle East – But it's all talk and no action!' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Monday. 'Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released before January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!' Trump wrote. During a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed appreciation for US President-elect Donald Trump's ultimatum that all hostages in Gaza must be released by January 20. Netanyahu said, 'This is a powerful statement, clearly placing responsibility for the situation on one party—Hamas. Trump rightly focused the blame on Hamas, rather than on the Israeli government, which is often the focus in other discussions.'

Hamas agrees to post-war plan that would put Gaza under US superv...	The plan proposed the Gaza be ruled by a committee of 10 to 15 members with US supervision. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Tuesday, a Qatari newspaper published a proposal that Hamas is willing to discuss that involves a committee controlling Gaza after the war and supervised by the United States, Ynet reports. The paper printed the 'Community Support Committee for the Management of the Gaza Strip' document, which proposes a committee to oversee Gaza after the war under US supervision. Following discussions between Hamas and Fatah in Cairo last Saturday, it was proposed that a committee of experts would govern Gaza with the supervision of US officials. The plan, which Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas has not yet approved, would include a committee in charge of health, the economy, education, agriculture, essential services, and the ongoing reconstruction efforts. The structure includes a committee of 10 to 15 members chosen for integrity and transparency. At the head will be a president, a vice president, and officials who will specialize in education, health, economic issues, local governance, reconstruction, and communication with foreign entities. In addition, an official will be responsible for oversight of the Rafah border where Hamas smuggled weapons into Gaza leading up to the war. If Hamas officially approves the proposal, it would mark a dramatic change from the terror group's former insistence on having complete control over Gaza and its rejection of agreements involving cooperation with international entities. The proposal is reminiscent of the ceasefire in Lebanon, which has international oversight of the southern region. However, such a proposal may fall short of Israel's goal of eliminating Hamas, and Israel may want military control over areas of Gaza, particularly the Philadelphi corridor, as articulated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu has declared that Israel must control this nine-mile-long line or else Hamas will easily rearm, rebuild, and become a new 'existential' threat to the Jewish state within a few years' time.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed appreciation for US President-elect Donald Trump's ultimatum that all hostages in Gaza must be released by January 20. Netanyahu said, 'This is a powerful statement, clearly placing responsibility for the situation on one party—Hamas. Trump rightly focused the blame on Hamas, rather than on the Israeli government, which is often the focus in other discussions.' On Monday, Donald Trump demanded that all hostages be released by the time he takes office on January 20, or there would be 'Hell to pay.' 'Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World in the Middle East – But it's all talk and no action!' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Monday. 'Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released before January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!' Trump wrote. On Sunday night, the Israeli Prime Minister's wife, Sara Netanyahu, dined with the incoming President at his Mar-a-Lago Gulf Club during her visit to Florida. The two discussed the plight of Israeli hostages still held captive in the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu wrote, as well as the war against the 'axis of evil.' On her Instagram account, Sara Netanyahu wrote, 'I also brought to the President's attention the immense suffering Israel endured on October 7 and the inhumanity of Hamas terrorists holding our citizens hostage under harsh conditions. I emphasized the urgent need to act for their release and swift return.' 'We also discussed the strategic importance of Israel's victory in the fight against the axis of evil, for a more stable and secure future in the Middle East and around the world.'

Internal analytics showed Harris locked in a dead heat with Trump in Wisconsin at 47-47, while trailing in Pennsylvania, where Trump held a slim 48-47 advantage. By Jewish Breaking News A candid post-campaign revelation from a senior Harris advisor has cast new light on the stark realities the Democratic campaign faced throughout the presidential race. Speaking on Monday’s Pod Save America podcast, senior advisor David Plouffe disclosed that internal polling never showed Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in key battleground states, contradicting some public polls that had suggested otherwise. Internal analytics showed Harris locked in a dead heat with Trump in Wisconsin at 47-47, while trailing in Pennsylvania where Trump held a slim 48-47 advantage. 'I mean, I think it surprised people because there were these public polls that came out in late September, early October, showing us with leads that we never saw,' Plouffe said. 'I think we were, you know, we were hopeful. I don’t know how optimistic we were, but we thought, okay, this is tied.' Even moments that seemed to promise a breakthrough proved less impactful than hoped. The campaign’s widely praised debate performance in the mainstream media barely moved polling numbers. 'I think even after the debate, we might have gained what, 0.5%. It wasn’t a race that moved a lot,' Plouffe admitted. Plouffe, who previously steered Barack Obama’s successful 2008 and 2012 campaigns, pointed to challenges in securing independent voters across crucial battleground states. He also defended the campaign’s strategy of partnering with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, arguing it was essential for broadening their appeal beyond the Democratic base. Following her resounding defeat to Trump, Harris maintained an optimistic public stance after returning from a recent trip to Hawaii. In a video released on social media by the Democratic National Committee, she acknowledged the outcome while celebrating raising $1 billion in campaign finances. 'The outcome of this election obviously is not what we wanted. It is not what we worked so hard for. But I am proud of the race we ran, and your role in this was critical. What we did in 107 days was unprecedented,' she said. 'I just have to remind you, don’t you ever let anybody take your power from you. You have the same power that you did before November 5th.'

Israel faces post-war ‘mental health tsunami,’ experts warn	The national suicide prevention program has been allocated a budget of 15.7 million shekels ($4.3 million) for 2024, with an additional two million ($550,000) secured following Health Committee efforts. By TPS The mental health of Israelis took center stage at the Knesset Health Committee on Tuesday as lawmakers were told of a sobering 40% rise in calls to crisis and mental health centers over the past year. While official data indicates no immediate spike in suicides during the war, experts warned of a potential surge as the nation transitions back to normality. 'It is about human life,' said committee chairman MK Yoni Mashriki. 'We must reach out to those on the brink, morally and socially.' He praised the addition of funds to the national suicide prevention program but stressed the need for further investment, particularly in Ministry of Education programs. Miri Cohen, director of government relations and national programs at the Ministry of Health cited data showing approximately 400-500 suicides annually in Israel, alongside 7,000 reported suicide attempts that reach emergency rooms. However, she cautioned that underreporting remains a significant issue, as some suicides are recorded under other causes of death. The national suicide prevention program has been allocated a budget of 15.7 million shekels ($4.3 million) for 2024, with an additional two million ($550,000) secured following Health Committee efforts. Cohen outlined extensive efforts across government ministries, non-profits, and local authorities, including collaborations with health funds, training thousands of therapists, and supporting bereaved families. Prof. Gil Salzman, chairman of the National Council for Suicide Prevention, warned of a 'mental health tsunami' as the nation grapples with the aftermath of war. He called for urgent measures, including stricter firearm regulations, increased caregiver resources, and enhanced funding for suicide prevention programs. Studies have shown such programs to be effective in reducing suicide rates, he said. The psychological impact extends to vulnerable populations, including families of abductees, who have received little to no mental health support. Representatives from various sectors echoed concerns about long wait times for mental health services and the stigma surrounding seeking help. Michal Englert, director of the Educational Psychology Division at the Ministry of Education, outlined efforts to bolster resilience and identify at-risk children through the Education Ministry’s 'Vacharat Haim' program. Each year, 3,550 educational counselors receive training, and 5,000 ninth-grade students participate in the program. However, Raz Gorotsky from the student council warned about late diagnoses and insufficient numbers of educational counselors. In the military, Lt. Col. Carmel Kella highlighted initiatives to address soldiers’ mental health, including treatment centers for regular and reservist troops, pre-combat mental preparation, and post-combat debriefing. A dedicated training course has been developed to help military personnel recognize signs of distress. Civil society organizations have also stepped in to fill gaps in the system. Hagai Harmesh, CEO of 'For the Life,' emphasized the urgency of reducing wait times for mental health appointments and addressing societal prejudices against seeking help. Y ehuda Tanuri Liman of Maccabi Healthcare noted that the organization has expanded its mental health workforce and integrated technologies for self-help and continuity of care.

Two said to be killed in IDF drone strike on terror cell in Jorda...	Israeli forces stormed a nearby hospital following the drone strike and prevented ambulances from reaching the terrorists. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces carried out a drone strike on an armed terrorist cell near the village of Aqaba in the Jordan Valley on Tuesday, resulting in two fatalities, according to Palestinian reports. Members of the cell were en route to carry out an attack, according to Israel’s Channel 12 News. The Palestinian Authority’s official WAFA news outlet reported that Israeli forces stormed a nearby hospital following the drone strike and prevented ambulances from reaching the terrorists. Aqaba is located near Jenin in northern Samaria, an area currently experiencing heightened terrorist activity. The Israeli military carried out a drone strike against a Palestinian terrorist cell near Jenin on Sunday morning, killing a Hamas operative responsible for a deadly shooting in the Jordan Valley last summer. Three other terrorists were eliminated in the attack, who according to the IDF had carried out several shootings against Israeli communities in the Gilboa area. In a joint statement on Nov. 27, the IDF and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) revealed that Israeli security forces had recently thwarted an attempt by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to smuggle heavy weaponry to Palestinian terrorist cells in Jenin. On Nov. 24, Israeli forces killed two Palestinian terrorists in the town of Ya’bad, 12 miles west of Jenin in northern Samaria, according to WAFA. In the first six months of 2024, Judea and Samaria saw more than 500 Arab terrorist attacks each month on average, according to data made public by Hatzalah Judea and Samaria (Rescuers Without Borders). During that period, first responders recorded 3,272 acts of terrorism in the region, including 1,868 cases of stoning, 456 fire bombings, 299 incidents involving explosives and 109 shootings. Terrorists murdered 14 people and wounded more than 155 others in Judea and Samaria between January and July, the rescue group said.

The Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, 'paralyzed state affairs and turned the National Assembly into a den of criminals,' South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in an unscheduled TV address Tuesday, vowing to eradicate what he alleges are pro-North Korean forces within the country. 'I declare martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from the threat of North Korean communist forces, to eradicate the despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order,' Yoon said. Yoon cited the opposition Democratic Party’s recent actions, including its motion to impeach the country’s top prosecutors and rejection of a government budget proposal. The president denounced the opposition party for 'clear anti-state behavior aimed at inciting rebellion.' The Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, 'paralyzed state affairs and turned the National Assembly into a den of criminals,' Yoon said, adding that 'the National Assembly has become a monster undermining liberal democracy, and the nation is in a precarious state, teetering on the edge of collapse.' While Yoon did not specify what measures would be taken, the South Korean military said that 'activities by parliament and political parties would be banned, and that media and publishers would be under the control of the martial law command,' according to Reuters. The announcement marks the first time since 1980 that martial law was declared in South Korea. Lee Jae-myung, leader of the opposition party, slammed Yoon’s move, claiming that 'tanks, armored personnel carriers, and soldiers with guns and knives will rule the country' and that 'the economy of the Republic of Korea will collapse irretrievably.' Yoon acknowledged that the martial law might cause inconvenience but promised to 'eliminate the anti-state forces and restore the country to normalcy as quickly as possible.'

Israel warns Lebanon IDF attacks won’t be limited to Hezbollah if...	Lebanon must pay a price' - Israeli ministers say Lebanese military must prevent Hezbollah attacks or face Israeli retaliation. By World Israel News Staff Israeli leaders warned Beirut Tuesday that if the current ceasefire with Hezbollah fails due to Lebanon's failure to enforce the truce in its territory, Israel will hold the Lebanese government responsible. On Monday, Hezbollah terrorists shelled Mount Dov, inside Israeli territory, the most significant breach of the ceasefire since it went into effect last Wednesday. A day later, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) issued a statement, warning that should the truce continue to be violated and the ceasefire agreement collapse, Israel will not limit its retaliatory strikes to Hezbollah itself, but will instead hold the Lebanese government responsible. 'There will no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon,' Katz said while visiting Israel's northern border Tuesday. 'We will work with all our might to enforce all the understandings of the ceasefire agreement, and we show maximum response and zero tolerance.' 'Yesterday was the first test, the shooting at Mount Dov. We reacted strongly and this is exactly what we will do, and we will not allow Hezbollah to return to the old methods they had, such as the [Hezbollah] tent that was set up and not attacked.' Katz demanded that Beirut 'authorize the Lebanese army to enforce their part, to keep Hezbollah away beyond the Litani and to dismantle all the infrastructure.' 'If they don’t do it and this whole agreement collapses then the reality will be very clear. First of all, if we return to war we will act strongly, we will go deeper, and the most important thing they need to know, that there will be no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon.' Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) echoed Katz's statements during an interview Tuesday with Kan Reshet Bet. 'The IDF is enforcing the agreement and the Lebanese government needs to pay a price so that it has an incentive to enforce the agreement,' Smotrich said.

Israel rebuts ‘disappointing’ accusations by European powers on G...	Israeli military says hundreds of truckloads of international aid are waiting idly at Gaza crossing point, rebutting European accusations Israel is limiting entry of aid to Gaza. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel pushed back Tuesday after three European governments accused the Jewish state of blocking the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. On Monday, Britain, Germany, and France penned a letter to the Israeli government, demanding Jerusalem increase the amount of aid - in particular fuel - to the Gaza Strip ahead of the start of the winter season, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced via X. 'Together Britain, France, and Germany have written to the Israeli government to urge action on the unacceptable humanitarian situation in Gaza,' Lammy tweeted. 'Israel must implement the UN's winter plan now: send equipment to guard against cold & flooding, give access to fuel, repair vital infrastructure, and get aid in.' On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Ministry Spokesman Oren Marmorstein fired back, calling the European governments' accusations against Israel and failure to condemn ongoing terror attacks 'disappointing.' 'It is disappointing that the foreign ministers of the E3 (Britain, France and Germany) failed to address the October 7 massacre and the daily attacks on Israeli civilians since then in their letter,' Marmorstein said. 'Israel is facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and does not impose any restrictions on the quantity of aid entering the Strip.' Marmorstein said that despite Israel's willingness to permit the entry of the aid, international organizations have failed to do so, in part because of looting by Hamas-backed gangs. In a tweet directed at United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Marmorstein wrote Tuesday: 'Israel is facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and does not impose any restrictions on the quantity of aid entering the Strip.' 'The ones failing to distribute the aid are international organizations, due to Hamas looting and the politicization of humanitarian efforts led by Secretary-General Guterres.' Earlier this week, the UN relief agency UNRWA announced that it had halted aid transfers into Gaza through Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing - the primary entry point into the Gaza Strip. The agency's chief said the route through Gaza was not safe, noting that multiple aid convoys had been raided recently by armed gangs. The Israeli Defense Ministry on Tuesday also furnished data regarding the quantity of international aid accumulating at the Kerem Shalom crossing. According to the ministry's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), there are roughly 780 truckloads of international aid waiting at the Kerem Shalom crossing, waiting to be transferred by aid workers into Gaza. COGAT also said that 138 aid trucks entered Gaza from Israel's three Gaza crossings on Monday.

IDF kills seven Hamas terrorists who took part in October 7th atr...	Israeli forces eliminate seven Hamas terrorists who invaded Israel on October 7th and took part in the atrocities across southwestern Israel. By World Israel News Staff Israeli forces operating in the Gaza Strip have killed seven more terrorists affiliated with Hamas who were involved in the invasion of southwestern Israel on October 7th and the subsequent atrocities on the Israeli-side of the border, an Israeli military spokesperson said Tuesday afternoon. According to a statement released by the IDF spokesperson's office, reserve soldiers from the army's 99th Division, serving in their third deployment since October 7th, 2023, have been operating in the Gaza Strip for the past two weeks. During their most recent deployment to the Gaza Strip, the 99th Division killed seven Hamas terrorists who invaded Israel on October 7th. The eliminated terrorists include Marzouk al-Hur, Maaz al-Hur, Abd Abu-Awad Yusri, Omar Abu-Abdallah, and Maad Abu-Garboua. In addition, two members of the elite Nukhba Force unit, which spearheaded the invasions of October 7th, were killed, including Ahmed Zahid and Abd al-Razzeq, a Hamas combat engineer. The IDF's 179th and 551st Brigades carried out multiple raids in the Gaza Strip recently, the army spokesperson said, in operations targeting Hamas facilities, observation posts, and sniper positions. During their raids, the 179th and 551st Brigades also confiscated or dismantled weapons at a number of caches. The caches included stores of bullet-proof vests, grenades, guns, ammunition, explosives, and mortars. In a separate statement on Tuesday, the IDF said it had carried out a drone strike on a vehicle transporting several terrorists in northern Samaria, outside the Palestinian Authority-administered town of Aqabah, on the western edge of the Jordan Valley. The Palestinian Authority's health ministry reported that two people were killed in the drone strike, with a third person injured and listed in moderate condition.

Minister accuses Israeli A-G of coup d’etat after prison service ...	Itamar Ben-Gvir, who appointed Kobi Yaakobi, accused the attorney-general of attempting a 'coup' against him with the move. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The head of Israel’s Prison Service (IPS) was detained for questioning Monday along with two senior police officers, in a case that National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called part of an attempted 'coup' against him. While there is an official gag order on the case, according to Ma'ariv, Chief Superintendent Kobi Yaakobi was mainly questioned about having allegedly passed on information from a senior police officer to Ben-Gvir regarding administrative arrests of right-wing activists. The deputy superintendent who allegedly leaked the classified information supposedly did so in return for a promotion that Yaakobi allegedly advocated for him. The officer’s arrest on suspicion of bribery was extended until Thursday, Ynet reported. A second police officer has also been detained on several charges, including failure to fulfill his duty, and misuse of authority. Other Hebrew media reported that during the 12-hour interrogation, Yaakobi was questioned about an incident in which he allegedly asked a policewoman to have a third party delete messages on Telegram that were considered damaging to National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Ynet reported that the third party was given the impression that his career advancement was on the line if he rejected the request. Yaakobi himself is suspected of obstruction of an investigative process and committing 'breach of trust,' an amorphous charge that is considered difficult to prove. He was released after the interrogation on condition that he does not contact any other suspects in the case and does not speak publicly about it. In a statement to Channel 12 Monday, he therefore said that he could not speak freely but that he has 'nothing to hide and nothing to hide from.' Yaakobi is close to Ben-Gvir, who appointed him to his position after he had served as Ben-Gvir’s security adviser. The National Security Minister blasted the arrests and interrogations as a way for Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara to get to him, as his ministry is in charge of both the police and prison service. 'The attorney general and the State Prosecutor’s Office are using the Department of Internal Police Investigations to deter a very senior officer in the Prison Service and police officers from carrying out my policy and that of the right-wing government,' Ben Gvir wrote on X Monday before Yaakobi’s name was allowed to be published. He went so far as to call her move an attempted 'coup,' saying, 'The decision to investigate officers who are operating according to my policies is a political decision that aims to overthrow the right-wing government.' Ben-Gvir gave Yaakobi his 'full support,' saying, 'As Commissioner, he has revolutionized the IPS, achieving governance and order within the organization.' Baharav-Miara, he added, 'did not like the changes and policies [Yaakobi] implemented, but in a democratic country, there is no room for 'framing a case’ against someone whose views and policies are not the same as yours.' The attorney-general has fiercely criticized Ben-Gvir several times for acting improperly and even illegally since he came into office, especially in the area of intervening in police operations, which she said the minister is barred from doing.

Hamas leadership welcomed by multiple countries, including Malays...	According to Sky News Arabia, senior Hamas officials left Doha for 'various destinations.' JNS Various countries—including Turkey, Iran and Russia—have welcomed Hamas members in recent weeks after the terror group’s leadership was asked to leave Qatar, Israel’s Kan News reported on Monday night. Senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya, once the deputy of now-slain terrorist mastermind Yahya Sinwar, has settled in Ankara, while others were said to be considering a move to Malaysia. Malaysia, a country with a Muslim majority and sizable Buddhist and Christian minorities, does not have diplomatic relations with Israel. Earlier on Monday, Sky News Arabia reported that Hamas’s entire senior leadership had left Qatar. Arab sources told the British channel that the terrorists’ family members had also left the country. According to the report, the senior Hamas officials left Doha for 'various destinations.' Hamas’s military wing is known to run the group’s operations in Malaysia. In 2010, Hamas sent 15 men to the Asian country to train in paragliding. Hamas used paragliders to infiltrate the Jewish state during their Oct. 7, 2023, invasion. In 2018, Hamas engineer Fadi Muhammad al-Batash was shot dead in Kuala Lumpur. He was an expert in suicide drones and rocket systems. The terror group accused Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency of orchestrating his death. Two years ago, Malaysian police arrested a group of locals on suspicions of kidnapping a Gaza-born computer programmer on Israel’s orders, allegedly because the Mossad believed him to be a Hamas asset. Unnamed Israeli sources previously confirmed to Kan that Hamas had relocated to Turkey. According to the Nov. 17 report, the development could have 'dramatic' consequences for the truce talks between Israel and Hamas, which have been mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. Hamas repudiated the reports, claiming that they were rumors spread by Israel. A Turkish diplomatic source also denied the claim, clarifying that members of the terrorist organization occasionally visit the country. A senior Hamas official told AFP on Monday that the Islamist group is waiting until international pressure forces Israel to end its war in Gaza before it will return to the negotiating table and close a hostage deal. 'Egypt, Qatar and Turkey are making great efforts to reach an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange,' said a Hamas official who was part of a Sunday meeting in Cairo on the issue, referring to a possible exchange of captives for Palestinian terrorists jailed in the Jewish state. 'Our Palestinian people are waiting for American and international pressure on [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu to stop the war and reach an agreement, as happened in Lebanon,' the terrorist added. Jerusalem believes that 97 of the 251 hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023 terror assault remain in Gaza. Hamas is also holding two Israeli civilians who entered Gaza in 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed during 'Operation Protective Edge' in 2014.

‘Refreshing’ – Israeli minister hails Trump’s ultimatum to Hamas	Senior Israeli minister lauds American president-elect's recent comments on Israeli captives in the Gaza Strip and warning to Hamas that there 'will be hell to pay' if hostages are not released by inauguration day. By World Israel News Staff A senior Israeli government minister lauded former President and President-elect Donald Trump Tuesday, hailing Trump's ultimatum to the Hamas terror organization Monday. On Monday, the incoming president took to the Truth Social media platform, demanding that Hamas release the captives held in the Gaza Strip by inauguration day on January 20th, warning that there 'will be hell to pay' if the demand is not met. 'Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America,' Trump wrote. On Tuesday, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) responded to Trump's comments, taking to X to tweet his appreciation for the president-elect's 'morally sound statements.' 'Thank you very much, Mr. President-elect! How refreshing it is to hear clear and morally sound statements that do not create a false equivalence or call for addressing 'both sides,' but rather clarify who are the good and who are the bad, where the light is and where the darkness lies,' Smotrich wrote in both Hebrew and English. 'This is the way to bring back the hostages: by increasing the pressure and the costs for Hamas and its supporters, and defeating them, rather than, giving in to their absurd demands. Thank You Donald Trump.' Israeli President Isaac Herzog also thanked Trump for his comments, tweeting: 'Thank you and bless you Mr. President-elect @realDonaldTrump. We all pray for the moment we see our sisters and brothers back home!' Since the November election, President-elect Trump has reportedly called for ceasefires both in Lebanon and Gaza, ending the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in the north and Hamas in the south. During the 2024 election campaign, Trump repeatedly urged Israel to wrap up its war in Gaza, a message he reiterated in a call to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following the presidential election.

State Department: US hasn’t determined if Israel violated Lebanon...	Matthew Miller, State Dept. spokesman, said that the ceasefire agreement, signed by Israel and Lebanon, contains a mechanism for reporting potential violations and how Washington and Paris will respond to them. By Mike Wagenheim, JNS The U.S. State Department said on Monday that the Israeli-Hezbollah ceasefire, which went into effect last Wednesday, is thus far 'successful, broadly speaking,' with no determination yet made of accusations of Israeli violations. Despite ongoing Israeli anti-terror strikes and Monday’s retaliation by Hezbollah, the ceasefire, brokered by the United States and France, has 'been successful in stopping the fighting and getting us on a path where we are not seeing the daily loss of life that we had seen for two months prior,' Matthew Miller, the department’s spokesman, told reporters at the daily press briefing. Miller said that violations were expected, especially in the opening weeks 'when things are very fragile.' Media reports cited Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration’s point man on the Israel-Lebanon file, as having been critical of early Israeli actions in Lebanon since the ceasefire came into effect. Miller did not confirm those reports. The ceasefire agreement, signed by Israel and Lebanon and which has not been made public, contains a mechanism for reporting potential violations and for the ways that Washington and Paris will respond to them, he said. That mechanism will become more formalized in the coming days, he noted. The National, an Emirati publication, printed what it says is the entirety of the ceasefire agreement last week. JNS asked Miller if that copy of the agreement, which was reported in Israel and elsewhere, was accurate. 'I’m not going to speak to that publicly,' Miller told JNS. 'We often see outlets report on various documents—sometimes that are final drafts, sometimes that are drafts along the way—but I’m not going to confirm.' JNS asked if it isn’t in the public interest for Washington to release the agreement. 'We have a vigorous monitoring mechanism in place to ensure that everyone toes the line, and we’re going to enforce it,' Miller said. He would not confirm reports that, under the agreement, Israel has the right to conduct strikes in Lebanese territory should it detect an imminent threat. 'But every country, both Israel—or say every country—that includes Israel and includes Lebanon as well—has the inherent right to self-defense under international law,' said Miller. 'That was a fact before the implementation of this ceasefire agreement. It remains a fact that all countries have the right to self-defense under international law.' ‘Incredibly frustrating’ Earlier in the day, the State Department and U.S. Treasury welcomed the Israeli cabinet’s decision to approve a 'one-year extension of its indemnification for Israeli banks, which underpins correspondent banking relationships with Palestinian counterparts.' That agreement protects Israeli banks doing business with Palestinian counterparts from running afoul of anti-terror laws. Israel reportedly secured a promise from the Biden administration to maintain its veto on Palestinian statehood at the U.N. Security Council in exchange for the banking decision. JNS asked Miller about the talks that led up to the announcement. 'We had really intense discussions with the government of Israel about intending—extending this correspondent banking agreement—much more intense conversations than should have been necessary,' Miller said. 'Obviously, the revocation of this agreement would have had disastrous effects for Palestinians in the West Bank, but the point that we kept impressing upon the government of Israel is that it would have had disastrous implications for the Israeli public as well,' he said. (The Biden administration and some others refer to Judea and Samaria as the West Bank.) 'It is not in Israel’s interests to see further instability in the West Bank. It is not in Israel’s interest to see the economy of the West Bank collapse,' Miller added. 'So, it’s incredibly frustrating that it took this long to get the government of Israel to extend this agreement for the year that it now did, something they should have just done through the regular course of business without any—let’s call it intense diplomatic efforts by the United States.' That said, Washington 'will continue to look at every resolution that comes before the United Nations Security Council, and judge whether voting ‘yes,’ voting ‘no,’ voting abstaining is in the interests of the United States, and we will make our judgments based on that and nothing else,' he added. Miller also told JNS that Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, was scheduled to meet later in the day with Ron Dermer, the Israeli strategic affairs minister and that there were no planned meetings at the State Department with Yoav Gallant, the former Israeli defense minister, who is in town.

Actor Kevin Spacey visits Gaza border communities in Israel devas...	Spacey was also photographed talking to Ayala Levinstein, a lone soldier from the U.S. whose father is reportedly a close friend of his. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner American actor Kevin Spacey visited over the weekend areas near the Israel-Gaza border that were impacted by the Oct. 7 deadly Hamas terrorist attack last year, Israel’s ILTV News reported. The former 'House of Cards' star, along with pro-Israel British author and journalist Douglas Murray, toured the site of the Nova music festival massacre and communities such as Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where 62 people were murdered last Oct. 7 and 19 others were taken hostage by Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists. Two hostages who were kidnapped from Kfar Aza on Oct. 7 — Yotam Haim and Alon Shamriz — escaped their kidnappers in the Gaza Strip but were mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers in December 2023. Spacey was also photographed in Israel talking to Ayala Levinstein, a lone soldier from the US who is serving in the IDF’s combat intelligence unit. The two-time Academy Award winner is reportedly a close friend of Levinstein’s father. Spacey is scheduled to leave Israel on Monday night. Murray is in Israel for scheduled speaking events, including two at the Tel Aviv Culture Center on Wednesday. The New York Times best-selling author said in a post on X that 3,000 people attended an event he participated in with conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro in Jerusalem in mid-November.

IAF hits Hezbollah after terror group fires mortars at Mount Dov	The Iranian-backed terrorist organization took responsibility for the Mount Dov attack, claiming it had fired at an Israeli military outpost 'as a warning.' By Joshua Marks, JNS The Israeli Air Force struck Hezbollah terrorist assets across Lebanon on Monday night in response to the Iranian proxy’s firing of two mortar shells across the border hours earlier in violation of the Nov. 27 ceasefire. Among the targets of the strikes was the launcher used in the Har Dov attacks, in the area of Berghoz in Southern Lebanon. Dozens of other launchers were also hit, along with Hezbollah terrorists and infrastructure, according to the Israel Defense Forces. 'Hezbollah’s launches tonight constitute a violation of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon. The State of Israel demands that the relevant parties in Lebanon fulfill their responsibilities and prevent Hezbollah’s hostile activity from within Lebanese territory. The State of Israel remains obligated to the fulfillment of the conditions of the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon,' the IDF said. The IAF struck Hezbollah terrorists, dozens of launchers, and terrorist infrastructure throughout Lebanon a short while ago. Additionally, the IAF struck the Hezbollah launcher in the area of Berghoz in southern Lebanon shortly after the launch of the two projectiles toward Mount… &mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) December 2, 2024 'The IDF is prepared to continue operating wherever necessary and will continue to operate to defend Israeli civilians,' the statement concluded. The Iranian-backed terrorist organization took responsibility for the Mount Dov attack, claiming it had fired at an Israeli military outpost 'as a warning.' The mortar shells impacted in open territory, causing no injuries or damage. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated following the attack that, 'We promised to respond to any violation of the ceasefire by Hezbollah—and that is exactly what we will do. Hezbollah’s firing at the IDF post on Mount Dov will be met with a harsh response.' 'What was will no longer be,' he added. Also on Monday night, a drone 'launched from the east' was intercepted by an Israeli Navy missile ship in the Red Sea area before crossing into Israeli territory, the military said, publishing a video of the interception. ספינת טילים של חיל הים יירטה לפני זמן קצר במרחב ים סוף כלי טיס בלתי מאויש ששוגר ממזרח. הכלי יורט בטרם חצה לשטח הארץ, על פי מדיניות לא הופעלו התרעות pic.twitter.com/ul0pBtL8F5 &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) December 2, 2024 Earlier on Monday, the IDF said that it had operated in the morning and on Sunday in response to threats posed by Hezbollah in violation of the truce, which went into effect on the morning of Nov. 27. The listed violations included several military vehicles operating in the area of a Hezbollah missile manufacturing site in the Beqaa Valley, that were struck, as were several sites next to the Syria-Lebanon border in the Hermel area that the IDF said were used to smuggle weapons. 'These posed a threat to the State of Israel and were a violation of the ceasefire understandings,' the IDF statement noted, adding that 'the IDF is operating against any threat against the State of Israel.' IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Sky News Arabia on Monday that Jerusalem remains committed to the ceasefire terms. 'UNIFIL forces and the Lebanese government must fulfill their roles—this is also in their interest. We need this period to ensure there are no terror bases there,' he said, emphasizing that the Lebanese people and government must ensure that 'Beirut and Southern Lebanon are free of weapons—not in homes, not in yards and not in children’s rooms.' Under the terms of the truce, Israeli forces are to withdraw from Lebanon over a period of 60 days, while Lebanon’s official army enters those areas vacated by the IDF. Hezbollah violated the terms of the ceasefire the day it took effect, according to the Israeli military. The governments of France and the United States, which are members of the monitoring mechanism overseeing the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire agreement, have also claimed violations by Jerusalem, primarily the use of IDF surveillance drones over Beirut. According to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, he told his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barrot on Monday that 'Israel is not violating the ceasefire understandings but is instead enforcing them in response to Hezbollah’s violations.' In a statement, the diplomat reiterated Jerusalem’s commitment to implementing the agreement and made it clear that Israel 'will not return to the reality of October 6, 2023,' the day before the Hamas-led massacre in the northwestern Negev that triggered the war.

Hamas, Palestinian Authority ink deal to jointly rule post-war Ga...	The Palestinian Authority's ruling Fatah party reportedly has agreed to share control of the Gaza Strip with Hamas after the current war with Israel. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Hamas terror organization has signed an agreement with the ruling faction of the Palestinian Authority paving the way for joint control of the Gaza Strip once the current war with Israel ends, according to a report Tuesday morning. Negotiators from Hamas and the Fatah party both told AFP Tuesday morning that the two sides had agreed to jointly administer the post-war Gaza Strip, adding that the rival factions have inked an agreement delineating the format for governing the coastal enclave. According to a draft of the agreement seen by AFP, once the current war with Israel is concluded, Hamas will form a joint committee with Fatah, made up of 10 to 15 non-partisan members chosen by the two organizations, to administer the Gaza Strip. The committee will, according to the agreement, be tasked with managing Gazan affairs ranging from education, healthcare, the distribution of international aid, reconstruction, and the economy. Under the terms of the agreement, Fatah and Hamas would jointly administer the Rafah crossing on the Gaza-Egyptian border. The deal was negotiated by delegations from the two factions, headed by Hamas politburo member Khalil al-Hayya and Fatah central committee member Azzam al-Ahmad. The agreement must still be brought to Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas for final approval, the report said. The document does not address Israel's role in the post-war Gaza Strip, ignoring the Netanyahu government's repeated declarations that the IDF will maintain a long-term security presence in Gaza. While a number of his ministers have called for comprehensive Israeli control and even resettlement of the Strip, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Israel will, at the very least, maintain control over the Philadelphi Corridor - which includes the Rafah crossing - as well as the Netzarim Corridor running across the neck of central Gaza.

No chance for goodbyes – American hostage’s mother dies	Gladys Siegel, 97, never knew her son was abducted on Oct. 7 or that he was held captive in Gaza ever since. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Gladys Siegel, the mother of American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, died Monday night at age 97 without her youngest child getting the chance to part from her. 'My father’s mother died and my father can’t say goodbye to her because he is in Hamas captivity for more than a year,' Siegel’s daughter Elan wrote in a Facebook post. 'My father can’t stand with us tomorrow in the cemetery, he can’t say goodbye to the woman who loved him and raised him his whole life,' she added. 'A violent and murderous terror organization dictates our lives — from Gaza to the great United States and the whole world is silent.' Living in an assisted-living facility in North Carolina, Gladys was never informed that her son, Keith, 65, had been abducted by Hamas terrorists last October 7 and has been held in Gaza ever since. Siegel and his wife, Aviva, members of Kibbutz Kfar Aza, were forced into their own car to be driven into the Gaza Strip by the terrorists who invaded their pastoral community as part of a coordinated surprise attack by thousands on dozens of locations in Israel, in which they massacred 1,200 and took 251 people in all as hostages. The terrorists also forced a neighbor and her two children into the Siegel car as well. Aviva was released among 86 kidnapped Israeli women and children during the week-long hostage-for-Palestinian prisoners exchange and ceasefire in November 2023, in the only deal to date with the terrorist organization. Out of the 101 people Hamas and other terrorists are still holding, Keith, 65, is still believed to be among those alive. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer reportedly told President-elect Donald Trump last month that the Israeli government thinks that 60 are still living, although officially the number stands at 76. Besides Siegel, there are seven other hostages with American citizenship. Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, of Kibbutz Nir Oz, is the only other American civilian still thought to be alive. Hamas released on Saturday a video of lone soldier Edan Alexander, 20, looking gaunt and pleading in both Hebrew and English for Israeli and U.S. leaders, including president-elect Donald Trump, to get a deal done to free him and his fellow abductees. Judi (70) and Gadi Haggai (73) of Kibbutz Nir Oz, and another soldier on duty that day, Itay Chen (19), were murdered on October 7 and their bodies taken by the terrorists. Hersh Goldberg-Polin (23) was kidnapped from the Nova festival and murdered in August along with five other hostages as IDF soldiers neared the tunnel where they were being held captive. On Monday, the IDF confirmed that American-Israeli lone soldier Omer Neutra had been murdered on the day of the invasion after he and his tank crew battled the terrorists, with his body still being held in Gaza. That evening, Trump posted a demand on his social platform that all the hostages be released by the day of his inauguration, January 20, 2025. If they aren’t freed by then, he promised, 'there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America.'

Chinese relic uncovered – in Jerusalem	The earliest known Chinese inscription in Israel, dating back 500 years, uncovered in Jerusalem. By World Israel News Staff The earliest archaeological evidence of the relationship between the Land of Israel and China was uncovered in Jerusalem on Mount Zion in an archaeological dig jointly conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Protestant Institute of Archaeology. A rare 16th century CE Chinese inscription was discovered on a porcelain bowl fragment, reading: 'Forever we will guard the eternal spring.' For the past three years, a joint excavation project between the Israel Antiquities Authority and the German Protestant Institute of Archeology (GPIA) has been underway at Mount Zion. Most of the findings uncovered in the excavation, led by Prof. Dieter Vieweger, date from the Byzantine period and earlier to the Second Temple period – well over 1,500 years ago. Against this background, the excavators were amazed to discover this inscription on the site, which belongs to a later period and has an unexpected origin. This past summer, during routine procedures for the upcoming excavation season, Michael Chernin, an archaeologist at the Israel Antiquities Authority, suddenly spotted a colorful object sticking out of the dirt that had been cleared away while preparing the site. When Michael pulled out the object and washed it, he recognized that there was an inscription on its bottom. Dr. Anna de Vincenz, pottery specialist, identified the inscription to be Chinese. At this point— the vessel was examined by the Hebrew University in Jerusalem’s researcher Jingchao Chen, who deciphered the inscription as reading, 'We will forever guard the eternal spring.' The bowl dates back to 1520-1570, and originated in the Ming Dynasty. 'Ancient Chinese porcelain vessels were previously found in Israel, but this is the first to bear an inscription,' say the researchers. How did a dish make its way from China to Mount Zion? Historical writings indicate close 16th century trade relations between the Chinese Empire and the Ottoman Empire, then ruling the Land of Israel. According to Ming Dynasty annals, about 20 official Ottoman delegations visited the imperial court in Beijing during the 15th-17th centuries. The trade relations between these empires are also described in travel books of merchants from this period. Thus, the writings of the Chinese scholar Ma Li from 1541 note colonies of Chinese merchants in Lebanese coastal cities such as Beirut and Tripoli. The work even mentions other important cities in the region such as Jerusalem, Cairo and Aleppo. 'In archaeological research, evidence of trade relations between merchants in the Land of Israel and the Far East is known even from earlier periods – for example, of various spices,' said Israel Antiquities Authority Director Eli Escusido. 'But it is fascinating to meet evidence of these relations also in the form of an actual inscription, written in the Chinese language, and in an unexpected place – on Mount Zion in Jerusalem.'

U.S. frets that Israel-Lebanon ceasefire ‘unraveling’	Biden administration officials complain that Israel is 'enforcing the ceasefire too aggressively.' By World Israel News Staff The U.S. is concerned that the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon could 'unravel' in the near future, with Hezbollah firing at IDF positions on Mount Dov and Jerusalem launching retaliatory attacks. Defense Minister Israel Katz pledged that any violations of the ceasefire by Hezbollah terrorists would invoke strong action from the Israeli army - a vow which has worried Washington. The Biden administration appeared to place the onus of responsibility on Israel, with a U.S. official telling Axios that 'the Israelis have been playing a dangerous game in recent days.' Biden Middle East adviser Amos Hochstein, who tried unsuccessfully for months to broker the ceasefire, reportedly complained to an Israeli official that Israel was 'enforcing the ceasefire too aggressively.' On Monday evening, the IDF carried out strikes targeting 'Hezbollah terrorists, dozens of launchers, and terrorist infrastructure throughout Lebanon,' hours after the terror group fired two shells at IDF assets in northern Israel. Despite the flare-up, Israeli officials assured Hochstein that they are committed to the ceasefire, according to the Axios report. 'We have warned both sides – Israel and Hezbollah – against actions that jeopardize the implementation of the ceasefire agreement,' U.S. officials told the Jerusalem Post. The sources added that they had chastised Israel to 'calm down,' and presumably ignore Hezbollah's violations of the ceasefire, rather than forcefully respond. The full terms of the Lebanon ceasefire agreement have not been made public. While residents of the north have been encouraged to return to their homes, schools in the northern border region have not reopened. Many of the tens of thousands displaced from their homes for more than 14 months have stressed that they will not return home until there is a decisive victory over Hezbollah, rather than a diplomatic agreement.

1,000 Nova survivors recognized as ‘disabled’ terror victims	Survivors of the massacre witnessed Hamas terrorists murdering, raping, kidnapping, and mutilating their victims. By World Israel News Staff More than 2,000 attendees of the Nova Festival requested psychological assistance from Israel's social services, and at least 1,000 survivors are recognized by the state as being disabled due to severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), according to a new report. More than a year after the Nova Festival Massacre, the Knesset's Information Center published a report regarding the psychological and financial support the state and social services have provided to survivors of the event. 399 people were murdered at the Nova party, marking the largest single-incident slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. According to the report, at least one Nova Festival survivor has taken their own life, with three others attempting suicide. The National Insurance Institute has recognized 3,710 attendees as victims of terror, a status which provides them with rights including psychological help and financial aid, including compensation for those who cannot work due to their physical injuries or mental state. At least 1,000 survivors are classified by the National Insurance Institute as suffering from disability, due to their level of trauma and mental distress interfering with their everyday functioning. Survivors of the massacre witnessed Hamas terrorists murdering, raping, kidnapping, and mutilating their victims. Slightly more than 2,000 attendees asked the state for mental support, including meeting with a psychologist. 75 percent of Nova Festival survivors are between the ages of 18 to 24, 20 percent are aged 25 to 45, and an additional 5 percent are younger than 18 or older than 45. Notably, the report features incomplete data, as it only includes information about people who attended the party who were not members of the IDF. It's unknown exactly how many off-duty IDF soldiers attended the Nova Festival, but based on Israel's mandatory draft and the ages of most attendees, the number likely includes hundreds of people. Those who were IDF soldiers at the time of the massacre are treated by the army's psychological welfare system, and therefore are not included in the report's data. This also means that suicides and suicide attempts by soldiers who survived the Nova Festival massacre are not reflected in the report.

Ex-hostage: ‘Gazans are brainwashed since birth to hate Jews’	Gazans are 'happy to sacrifice their children to kill Jews. That’s how they live,' says freed hostage Louis Har. By World Israel News Staff A former hostage held by the Hamas terror group said that his political views had changed dramatically following his abduction, noting that the average Gazan is raised from a young age to support the murder of Jews. Louis Har, 71, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak on October 7th. His sister, niece, long-term girlfriend, and brother-in-law were also abducted. Har's sister, niece, and girlfriend were released in a December 2023 hostage deal, while he and his brother-in-law were held in various locations throughout Gaza. 'My views have changed a lot from October 6 until today,' Har said during a recent interview on the Melting Pot podcast. 'I don’t trust any of [the Gazans]. I know that in some way, everyone in Gaza is involved. They were born to hate. They are given weapons when they are babies. They’re happy to sacrifice their children to kill Jews. That’s how they live.' Har said that the brainwashing is so intense that even having a dialogue with the average Gazan regarding peace with Israel cannot happen, until there are dramatic changes to the Gazan education system 'To achieve dialogue and coexistence, several generations of proper education in which hatred isn’t taught need to pass. That does not exist. There is no one to talk to. Before I was abducted, I wanted to live [alongside them] in peace and coexistence,' he added. In Israel, Har stressed, 'we do not hate. We are truly trying to move forward.' In February 2024, Har and his brother-in-law were rescued from an apartment building in Rafah - where they were held in a Gazan family's home - in a daring IDF operation. When NPR asked Har about Gazans killed during the rescue raid, the former captive said that 'most of the people there are Hamas. They don't intend to pet us and to love us, and I have no mercy toward them at the moment.'

Herzog counters former DM Yaalon’s claims: ‘The IDF does not comm...	President Herzog: 'The IDF is a morally responsible army that adheres to the highest international legal standards and humanitarian principles, with each unit supported by thorough legal guidance.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News At a screening of a film about October 7th at the Museum of Tolerance in Jerusalem, Israeli President Isaac Herzog implicitly criticized remarks made by former Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon that the IDF was committing 'war crimes' and 'ethnic cleansing' in Gaza, Arutz Sheva reports. Before the screening of The Children of October 7th,' President Herzog described the 'diplomatic and security challenges' Israel faces, as well as attempt to harm Israel's standing among nations through biased and unilateral legal forums, such as the International Criminal Court and its arrest warrants issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. He stated, 'Repeatedly, we counter false accusations against us, including the baseless claims of genocide or ethnic cleansing supposedly committed by the IDF. These are complete lies. IDF soldiers do not murder, nor do they engage in ethnic cleansing. End of story.' The President stated, 'The IDF is a morally responsible army that adheres to the highest international legal standards and humanitarian principles, with each unit supported by thorough legal guidance.' Herzog emphasized the right of Israel to defend itself, particularly when faced with the devastation of October 7th in kibbutzim such as Moshav Netiv HaAsara, which lost 21 residents. Responding indirectly to Moshe Ya'alon's remarks, Herzog said, 'The accusation that IDF soldiers engage in genocide or ethnic cleansing is not only completely false and disconnected from reality, but it also undermines our soldiers, commanders, and Israel's security and diplomatic efforts during wartime. I fully condemn and reject these claims.' Ya'alon, who was once the IDF's Chief of Staff and served as Defense Minister nearly a decade ago in a previous government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said in an interview with Democract Tv that the IDF is guilty of ethnic cleansing in Gaza. Speaking to Channel 12, Ya'alon reiterated his remarks, claiming that 'far-right' elements within Netanyahu's coalition were instructing the IDF to 'carry out what are defined as war crimes.' Ya'alon added that the IDF is 'no longer the most moral army in the world.'

Four face terror charges over flares launched at PM’s residence	The prosecution requested that the defendants be held in detention until the end of the legal proceedings. By JNS Prosecutors filed terrorism charges on Monday against four suspects over the launching of maritime flares at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea on the night of Nov. 16. Rear Adm. (res.) Ofer Doron, 63, his son Gal Doron, 27, Amir Sadeh, 62, and Itay Yafeh, 62, were charged in the Haifa District Court with terrorism-related reckless behavior, attempted arson, and obstruction of justice. The decision to launch the flares during a demonstration outside Netanyahu’s residence was driven by ideological and political motives, according to a Channel 12 summary of the indictment. The anti-government activists allegedly wanted to send a message to Netanyahu that the demonstrations near his Caesarea home were still ongoing, with the goal of increasing the pressure on him to advance the demands of the protesters. The indictment also underscores that the defendants anticipated their actions would likely incite fear and panic, especially among those near the prime minister’s home, including Netanyahu and his family. Furthermore, the indictment accuses Ofer of trying to protect his son Gal by misleading investigators about his involvement. The indictment also describes how Gal Doron and Yafeh put on gloves for the launch, which Ofer Doron recorded with the intention of uploading to social media. The prosecution emphasized that the defendants were aware that the firing of the flares could spark a fire in a populated area. During a hearing at the Rishon Letzion Magistrate’s Court, Ofer Doron did not apologize to Netanyahu or his family, but to his security detail affected by the incident, saying that the act was intended as a nonviolent public protest. 'We never intended to harm a symbol of governance. That’s not the nature of our protest. We’ve always said violence is unacceptable,' he said. The prosecution requested that the defendants be held in detention until the end of the legal proceedings. Netanyahu and his family were not home at the time of the attack. Video of the incident posted to social media shows two flares launched into the sky. They fell in the yard of the home.

Muslim NFL player under scrutiny for ‘dirty hit’ against QB, whil...	One cleat displayed the message 'Surely to Allah we belong and to him we will all return,' while the other listed Hamas casualty figures from the war. By Jewish Breaking News Houston Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair made headlines Sunday not only for knocking out Jacksonville Jaguars star quarterback Trevor Lawrence with a controversial hit, but also for wearing cleats displaying inflated Gazan casualty numbers. The second-quarter collision, which sparked a bench-clearing brawl at TIAA Bank Field, saw Al-Shaair deliver a violent blow to Lawrence’s head as the quarterback attempted to slide. The hit resulted in Lawrence’s immediate removal from the game with a concussion and Al-Shaair’s ejection alongside Jaguars cornerback Jarrian Jones. But it was Al-Shaair’s choice of footwear that drew equal ire from fans on social media. As part of the NFL’s annual My Cause My Cleats initiative, the linebacker opted to support the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund. One cleat displayed the message 'Surely to Allah we belong and to him we will all return,' while the other listed Hamas casualty figures from the war. Al-Shaair talked about his decision to wear the cleats last month. 'I feel like it’s something that’s trying to be almost silenced,' he told the Houston Chronicle. 'On either side, people losing their life is not right. In no way, shape or form am I validating anything that happened, but to consistently say that because of Oct. 7 innocent people in Gaza should now die, it’s crazy.' The number of civilian casualties in Gaza has been at the center of international attention since the start of the war. The main source for the data has been the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry (MOH), which now claims more than 45,000 dead, the majority of which it says are children and women. However, a closer examination reveals that Hamas has been using unreliable methods to count the dead.

Texans linebacker comes under scrutiny over QB knockout, pro-Hama...	One cleat displayed the message 'Surely to Allah we belong and to him we will all return,' while the other listed Hamas casualty figures from the war. By Jewish Breaking News Houston Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair made headlines Sunday not only for knocking out Jacksonville Jaguars star quarterback Trevor Lawrence with a controversial hit, but also for wearing cleats displaying inflated Gazan casualty numbers. The second-quarter collision, which sparked a bench-clearing brawl at TIAA Bank Field, saw Al-Shaair deliver a violent blow to Lawrence’s head as the quarterback attempted to slide. The hit resulted in Lawrence’s immediate removal from the game with a concussion and Al-Shaair’s ejection alongside Jaguars cornerback Jarrian Jones. But it was Al-Shaair’s choice of footwear that drew equal ire from fans on social media. As part of the NFL’s annual My Cause My Cleats initiative, the linebacker opted to support the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund. One cleat displayed the message 'Surely to Allah we belong and to him we will all return,' while the other listed Hamas casualty figures from the war. Al-Shaair talked about his decision to wear the cleats last month. 'I feel like it’s something that’s trying to be almost silenced,' he told the Houston Chronicle. 'On either side, people losing their life is not right. In no way, shape or form am I validating anything that happened, but to consistently say that because of Oct. 7 innocent people in Gaza should now die, it’s crazy.' The number of civilian casualties in Gaza has been at the center of international attention since the start of the war. The main source for the data has been the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry (MOH), which now claims more than 45,000 dead, the majority of which it says are children and women. However, a closer examination reveals that Hamas has been using unreliable methods to count the dead. According to a Washington Institute report, Hamas’ data collection methods changed dramatically in early November 2023 after hospitals in northern Gaza began shutting down during Israel’s ground invasion. The MOH switched from traditional hospital and morgue certification to an undefined system based on media reports—a dramatic shift that went largely unacknowledged. MOH statistics also fail to distinguish between civilian and terrorist casualties, further complicating efforts to assess the true human cost of the conflict.

US, UAE discussed lifting Assad sanctions in exchange for break w...	If Assad embraces Iranian help for a counter-offensive, that could also complicate efforts to drive a wedge between them. By Reuters and The Algemeiner The US and the United Arab Emirates have discussed with each other the possibility of lifting sanctions on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad if he peels himself away from Iran and cuts off weapons routes to Lebanon’s Hezbollah, five people familiar with the matter said. The conversations intensified in recent months, the sources said, driven by the possible expiry on Dec. 20 of sweeping US sanctions on Syria and by Israel’s campaign against Tehran’s regional network, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and Iranian assets in Syria. The discussions took place before anti-Assad rebels swept into Aleppo last week in their biggest offensive in Syria for years. According to the sources, the new rebel advance is a signal of precisely the sort of weakness in Assad‘s alliance with Iran that the Emirati and US initiative aims to exploit. But if Assad embraces Iranian help for a counter-offensive, that could also complicate efforts to drive a wedge between them, the sources said. Iran‘s foreign minister Abbas Araqchi visited Syria on Sunday in a show of support for Assad, and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke to Assad by phone about latest developments at the weekend. For this story, Reuters spoke to two US sources, four Syrian and Lebanese interlocutors, and two foreign diplomats who said the US and UAE see a window to drive a wedge between Assad and Iran, which helped him recapture swathes of his country during the civil war that erupted in 2011. Lebanese media have reported that Israel had suggested lifting US sanctions on Syria. But the UAE initiative with the US has not previously been reported. All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the back-room diplomacy. Syria’s government and the White House did not respond to questions from Reuters. The UAE referred Reuters to its statement on bin Zayed’s call with Assad. The UAE has taken a leading role in rehabilitating Assad among the mainly Sunni Muslim Arab states that shunned him after he accepted help from Shi’ite, non-Arab Iran to put down the Sunni-led rebellion against him. The Emirates hosted Assad in 2022, his first visit to an Arab country since the start of the war, before the Arab League reinstated Syria’s membership. The UAE has long hoped to distance Assad from Iran and wants to build business ties with Syria, but US sanctions have hampered those efforts, the sources said. A senior regional diplomat briefed by Tehran told Reuters Iran had been informed 'about behind-the-scenes efforts by some Arab countries to isolate Iran … by distancing Syria from Tehran.' The diplomat said those efforts were linked to offers of possible sanctions relief by Washington. ‘CARROT AND STICK’ Hezbollah, an internationally designated terrorist group, and its patron Iran have intervened in Syria since 2012 to protect Assad against Sunni rebels — but their bases and weapons shipments through Syria have been repeatedly hit by Israel, which has sought to weaken Iran across the region. In recent months, Hezbollah withdrew fighters from Syria, including the north, to focus on battling Israel in southern Lebanon. The rebels who swept this week into Aleppo pointed to the Hezbollah withdrawal as one of the reasons why they faced little resistance from government forces. A US source familiar with the matter said White House officials discussed an overture with Emirati officials, citing the UAE‘s interest in financing Syria’s reconstruction and Assad‘s 'weakened position' after Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah. The possibility of sanctions relief for Assad, while Israel was hitting Iran‘s allies, created an 'opportunity' to apply a 'carrot-and-stick approach' to fracture Syria’s alliance with Iran and Hezbollah, the US source said. SANCTIONS RELIEF The US placed sanctions on Syria after Assad cracked down against protests against him in 2011, and the sanctions were repeatedly tightened in the years of war that followed. The toughest, known as the Caesar Act, passed Congress in 2019. The Caesar sanctions apply across Syrian business sectors, to anyone dealing with Syria regardless of nationality and to those dealing with Russian and Iranian entities in Syria. Assad said they amounted to economic warfare, blaming them for the Syrian currency’s collapse and drop in living standards. The sanctions will 'sunset' — or expire — on Dec. 20 unless renewed by US lawmakers. Part of the recent American-Emirati discussions centered on allowing Caesar sanctions to expire without renewal, said the US source and three of the Syrian interlocutors. One Syrian interlocutor said the UAE had raised letting them expire with White House officials two months ago, after having unsuccessfully pushed for at least two years of sanctions relief for Assad after a deadly earthquake in Feb. 2023. Mohammad Alaa Ghanem, a Syrian activist in Washington, DC with the Citizens for a Secure and Safe America, told Reuters his group had been working to extend the Caesar sanctions and assessed they had bipartisan support to do so. 'We’ve been in talks over this for the past couple of months, although of course no political outcome in a town like Washington can be guaranteed 100 percent,' he said. Arab states have other potential avenues to reward Assad for distancing himself from Iran. A foreign diplomat based in the Gulf told Reuters both the UAE and Saudi Arabia had in recent months offered 'financial incentives' to Assad to split with Iran, saying they could not have been made without coordination with Washington. A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Syria, among other crises in the region, was a topic of discussion during Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to the UAE on Sunday. A Lebanese interlocutor said the UAE had also pledged funds to help Syria rebuild war-ravaged infrastructure as a way to 'pull Assad further away from Iran.' Iran has warned Assad not to stray far. The senior regional diplomat briefed by Tehran said Iran‘s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei conveyed a message via his senior adviser Ali Larijani, who told Assad: 'Do not forget the past.' 'The message served as a reminder to Assad of who his true allies are,' the diplomat said. ‘PLAYING WITH FIRE’ Since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7 last year precipitating war in Gaza, Iran has mobilized its network of allies to hit Israel. But Assad has largely avoided joining in, even as Israel struck Hezbollah targets in his country and bombed an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus. A US official said Assad had 'sat out' the war to avoid further Israeli strikes on Syria, and remained under 'tremendous pressure' not to allow Hezbollah to re-arm through his country. Israel has signaled that it still has eyes on Syria. When announcing the truce with Lebanon last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had been thwarting attempts by Iran, Hezbollah and Syria’s army to bring weapons into Lebanon. 'Assad must understand — he is playing with fire,' Netanyahu said.

Israel has 20,000 traumatized troops and not enough rehab staff	A survey by Maccabi showed that only 18% of its clients said they required mental health treatment in 2023, but 30% said they needed it in 2024. By JNS Israel’s ongoing war has produced about 20,000 soldiers and security forces personnel with post-traumatic stress disorder and a shortage of social workers to treat them, a defense official said on Sunday. Channel 12 revealed the data in an item aired about the Israeli Defense Ministry’s understaffed programs for treating psychological issues. The data suggest that troops traumatized after Oct. 7, 2023, constitute at least 3% of Israel’s military force. The ministry’s director general, Eyal Zamir, recently asked the Finance Ministry for a budget hike of tens of millions of shekels to hire 200 additional social workers to help traumatized soldiers. This was a 'strategic issue,' Zamir wrote, warning that the ministry’s Rehabilitation Department would not be able to accommodate the needs of the many soldiers who began requiring its mental-health services since the war began. So far, the treasury has added 50 social workers, it told Channel 12. Tally Shmuel, the chief psychiatrist at the Maccabi Healthcare Services HMO, said that the numbers of soldiers and others with PTSD are likely to increase in the coming months. The crisis affecting traumatized security personnel is part of a broader issue in society, where the consumption of anti-anxiety medication during the third quarter of 2024 increased by 20% over the same period from the previous year, Channel 12 reported, citing Health Ministry statistics. A survey by Maccabi showed that whereas only 18% of its clients said they required mental health treatment in 2023, the figure has risen to 30% in 2024. Among IDF reservists, 42% said that they required this treatment in 2024. In southern Israel, 70% of residents who are members of Maccabi told the provider they suffer from post-traumatic issues.

Israel uncovers 200 Iranian cyberattacks, phishing attempts again...	The Shin Bet warned that Iranian agents typically approach their targets through WhatsApp, Telegram, or email, crafting different cover stories for each targeted individual. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Israel uncovered around 200 Iranian cyberattacks attempts targeting Israeli civilians, including prominent figures, the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) disclosed on Monday. According to the Shin Bet, the hackers sought to access personal devices and information such as home addresses, personal connections, and places of frequent presence. 'This represents a significant additional threat in Iran’s campaign against Israel, aimed at carrying out assassination attacks,' a Shin Bet official said. This information, the Shin Bet stressed, was intended to facilitate attacks against these individuals using Israeli operatives recruited locally. In recent months, authorities thwarted nine attempts by Israelis recruited by Iran to carry out missions in Israel. The Shin Bet warned that Iranian agents typically approach their targets through WhatsApp, Telegram, or email, crafting different cover stories for each targeted individual. The goal is to convince their intended victim to download an application that either installs malware on their personal device or directs them to a fake website. Targets are then asked to provide login credentials for their personal or organizational email accounts, which the hackers can then use to gain access to the victim’s email or computer. Upon identifying the campaign and its scope, the Shin Bet warned the targeted individuals. In October, authorities arrested an Israeli man for spying on a nuclear scientist who Iranian agents wanted to assassinate, a couple who gathered intelligence on sensitive national infrastructure sites and high-profile academic figures, and a separate plot to assassinate the mayor of a large city and a scientist.

Hezbollah fires first missiles since ceasefire took effect	The Israel Defense Forces on Monday confirmed carrying out airstrikes on a Hezbollah missile production facility in the Beqaa Valley and other sites in the Hermel area of the Lebanon-Syria border used for weapons smuggling. By Pesach Benson, TPS Hezbollah fired two missiles at Mount Dov, an area of northern Israel where the borders of Israel, Lebanon and Syria converge on Monday. The barrage was the first since a ceasefire took effect on Wednesday morning. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the barrage, calling it 'a warning' to Israel. The rocket-fire came as the United States and France claimed that Israel was violating the ceasefire. According to Hebrew media reports, the issue is Israeli surveillance flights over Beirut, which Washington and Paris claim breaks the ceasefire. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar responded, saying,' 'The opposite is true – Israel is working to enforce the agreement in response to violations by Hezbollah, which require immediate action. For example, when armed Hezbollah terrorists are identified in southern Lebanon or when an attempt is made to transfer weapons.' Sa’ar warned his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barrot that Hezbollah must move its forces north of the Litani River or Israel would take further steps. The Israel Defense Forces on Monday confirmed carrying out airstrikes on a Hezbollah missile production facility in the Beqaa Valley and other sites in the Hermel area of the Lebanon-Syria border used for weapons smuggling. Meanwhile, IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari warned Iran not to use Syria’s civil war to smuggle weapons to Hezbollah. 'What is happening in Syria concerns Syria and not Israel,' Hagari told Sky News Arabic, adding that Israel 'will make sure that Iran does not smuggle weapons to Lebanon and Hezbollah.' 'Hezbollah was defeated in the campaign and it is necessary to make sure that it does not receive weapons from Iran through Syria,' Hagari said. 'And if they try to do it, we will act accordingly,' he stressed. On Sunday night, Israeli Air Force jets forced an Iranian plane in Syrian airspace suspected of carrying weapons to turn back to Tehran. Under the terms of the agreement, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its armed presence from areas of southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. Israeli forces will also withdraw from southern Lebanon in stages. The Lebanese Armed Forces is to be deployed in southern Lebanon including along the 120 km border with Israel, as will monitors from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Israel warns Iran not to rebuild Hezbollah’s forces	IDF says it has monitored Iran working in Syria to reinforce Assad regime as rebels capture key city, warns Tehran not to use foothold in Syria to rebuild Hezbollah amid ceasefire with Israel. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military on Monday warned Iran that the IDF has monitored Iranian forces operating in Syria to bolster the Assad regime, adding that Israel will not tolerate Tehran using its foothold on Israel's northern border to reinforce Hezbollah. Speaking with Sky News Arabia, IDF Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari accused Iran of attempting to transfer weapons to Hezbollah in an effort to help the terror group rebuild its operational capabilities during the ceasefire with Israel. 'The Iranian regime continues its attempts to transfer weapons to Hezbollah,' Hagari said, 'which Israel considers a direct threat to its national security.' Hagari hinted that should Israel detect Iran shipping weapons to Hezbollah, the IDF would take action, while declining to specify what form Israel’s response would take. 'We are making sure that Iranian weapons will not reach Lebanon or Hezbollah. If that happens, we will act appropriately.' The IDF chief spokesman appeared to signal that Israel would not interfere with Iranian efforts to strengthen the Syrian military, after anti-Assad rebels captured the city of Aleppo. 'We are closely following what is happening in Syria. We saw that the Iranian regime is sending reinforcements to Syria.' 'Syria belongs to the Syrians,' Hagari continued. 'What is happening in Syria concerns Syria and not Israel.' Hagari confirmed that Israel intercepted an Iranian plane Sunday and prevented it from landing at Damascus International Airport, claiming the aircraft was carrying weapons destined for Hezbollah. 'The measure was intended to prevent the smuggling of weapons to Hezbollah.' Turning to the ceasefire with Hezbollah, Hagari said that it would be implemented 'gradually.' 'We must ensure that these areas [near the Israeli border in southern Lebanon] are free of any terrorist bases to ensure our security and the security of our citizens.'

Justice and unity: The battle to protect Montreal’s Jewish commun...	While Montreal burned, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was notably absent from the crisis, attending a Taylor Swift concert. By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News Montreal is no stranger to antisemitism, but since October 7, the hostility against Jewish communities has reached alarming levels. From violent protests targeting synagogues and Jewish-owned businesses to direct threats of physical harm, the environment for Jews in Montreal has become increasingly dangerous. Anti-Israel protest near Mcgill University, Montreal, Canada. (Screenshot/Facebook) Yet, amidst the chaos, Jewish leaders, students, and activists are responding with resilience, legal action, and a firm commitment to their identity. At the forefront of this fight for justice are individuals like Michael Hollander, a commercial lawyer who has coordinated high-profile cases to defend Jewish institutions; Neil Oberman, a lawyer and the Conservative candidate for Mount Royal who has represented key cases in court; and Ysabella Elisheva Hazan, a young law graduate and activist advocating for open dialogue in the face of intimidation. Together, they represent a community fighting not only for its safety but for its right to exist unapologetically. A City at Boiling Point The rise in antisemitism in Montreal is no longer confined to rhetoric—it’s spilling into the streets. On November 29, a man entered a Jewish-owned business and shouted a tirade of threats, declaring, 'We’re gonna kill you one by one!' The incident was caught on video, and while a police report was filed, no arrests have been made. Anti-Israel protestor setting fire to effigy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during anti-Israel riot in Montreal, Friday, November 22, 2024 (Nioh Berg/X) This incident follows a violent pro-Palestinian riot in Montreal, where demonstrators set fire to an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, smashed store windows, and torched vehicles. These events are far from protests—they are hate-fueled rallies that incite violence. While Montreal burned, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was notably absent from the crisis, attending a Taylor Swift concert. His presence at the concert sent a starkly different message to the Jewish community and to Canadians at large about the priorities of the country’s leadership during a moment of rising tension and violence. Although Trudeau condemned the riots days later, stating, 'Acts of antisemitism, intimidation, and violence must be condemned wherever we see them,' his earlier statement that he would arrest Netanyahu if he visited Canada undermined his credibility. For many, these mixed messages embolden antisemitic actors who view Jewish identity as inseparable from the Jewish state. The Legal Battle: Protecting the Community As antisemitic hostility mounts, Michael Hollander has taken on a central role in coordinating legal protections for Montreal’s Jewish institutions. Montreal4Palestine poster at McGill (Courtesy) Hollander and Neil Oberman collaborated on obtaining an injunction to protect Federation CJA, Montreal’s largest Jewish organization, after hostile groups including Montreal4Palestine, Independent Jewish Voices, and the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) laid siege to its building on March 4, 2024. Protesters blocked the doors for hours, vandalized the property, assaulted attendees, and chanted, 'Death to the Jews.' The injunction, which Oberman represented in court, was later expanded to protect 27 Jewish institutions, including synagogues, schools, and community centers. These institutions now have a 50-meter buffer zone, offering a measure of safety from similar attacks. Hollander played a key role in coordinating efforts to ensure legal action was effective and consistent throughout this period. 'These aren’t protests—they are literal hate rallies meant to intimidate and silence,' Hollander explained. 'In 2024, Jews shouldn’t have to navigate this level of hostility just to attend school or synagogue.' The Legal Climate in Montreal Despite these challenges, Hollander noted that the courts have been largely receptive to cases addressing antisemitism. 'The courts have consistently shown they are ready to come to the aid of those who need it,' he said. However, he emphasized that obstacles often stem from administrative bodies and inconsistent enforcement of laws. 'Institutions like the Human Rights Commission have proven ineffective in addressing these issues,' Hollander explained. 'It’s not the courts that fail us—it’s the inconsistent application of the law by those tasked with upholding it.' Notable Moments in the Fight Hollander shared several pivotal moments from his work: • At the Spanish &#038; Portuguese Synagogue, Hollander coordinated efforts while Oberman represented in court to secure protections against another planned hate rally targeting the synagogue. • Deposing individuals from hate groups revealed their unwillingness to acknowledge the humanity of Jewish people, with one leader refusing to even shake his hand. • Supporting a Muslim student who faced threats for defending Jewish classmates underscored the shared stakes in combating hatred and extremism. 'These moments remind me how crucial our legal system is,' Hollander reflected. 'The stakes are not just about individual safety—they are about the community as a whole.' A Call for Leadership and Lawful Governance McGill University in Montreal (Shutterstock) As the challenges facing Jewish students and communities continue to mount, Neil Oberman, a lawyer and the Conservative candidate for Mount Royal, has emphasized the urgent need for decisive leadership at every level of government and within institutions. Oberman articulated his stance, stating: 'It is imperative that university administrators prioritize the safety of their students during their educational pursuits. There must be a strict zero-tolerance policy for any form of hatred or aggression on campus. My colleagues and I are committed to reinstating law and order in Montreal, as a secure environment is essential for effective learning.' He pointed to ineffective leadership at municipal, federal, and institutional levels as a key contributor to the rise in campus hostility, adding: 'In a society that values freedom and democracy, individuals should not feel apprehensive about leaving their homes, attending classes, or utilizing public facilities.' Oberman further outlined his vision for addressing these issues after the upcoming election cycle: 'Alongside Pierre Poilievre and the Conservative Party of Canada, we aspire to rejuvenate our nation after nine years of Liberal-NDP governance that has weakened our fundamental institutions and distorted public perceptions of Canada.' Oberman stressed that the current challenges are rooted in longstanding issues that predate the October 7th crisis. He criticized Ottawa’s ineffective leadership, stating that mixed messages from the federal government have sown confusion and allowed extremists to exploit the lack of clarity to propagate hateful ideologies. 'Such behavior will no longer be tolerated under a Conservative Party administration,' Oberman affirmed. 'Our communities cannot thrive if individuals driven by hate impede others from living freely each day. Only through collaboration with responsible Canadians and reforming our institutional frameworks can we hope to restore safety across Canada.' A Collective Stand Against Antisemitism Thousands of Jews gather in Montreal for the 'March for Jerusalem.' (Twitter Screenshot) Recognizing the need for broader community assistance, Hollander and a few colleagues helped establish the Quebec Legal Jewish Alliance. Comprising 300 lawyers, this organization provides legal services for less high-profile but equally critical cases. It assists students, teachers, employees, and others in Montreal who face antisemitism but may not have the resources to consult a lawyer. 'There’s a high volume of incidents in Montreal right now,' Hollander said. 'The Alliance steps in where individuals might otherwise feel powerless.' Oberman also represented two Jewish students at McGill University in a case against the McGill Encampment. While the case was ultimately unsuccessful, it underscored the extent of hostility faced by Jewish students on campus. Hollander continues to provide support on related issues and highlighted his ongoing lawsuit against Concordia University, which underscores the institutional failure to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence. Advocating for Dialogue: Ysabella Hazan’s Perspective While Hollander focuses on legal advocacy, activists like Ysabella Elisheva Hazan are addressing antisemitic narratives in the public sphere. A law graduate and founder of Decolonized Judean, an empowerment movement, Hazan has become a vocal advocate for Jewish empowerment and open dialogue. Hazan was scheduled to speak at an event at McGill University alongside Mosab Hassan Yousef, also known as the 'Son of Hamas.' However, after significant opposition and even death threats, McGill canceled all in-person events for the remainder of the year. While the event never took place, Hazan’s message remains clear: dialogue and resilience are the antidotes to suppression. 'Anti-colonial tactics of resistance won’t work on Jews, an indigenous people to Israel,' Hazan explained. 'The sooner this is understood, the quicker we can create meaningful dialogue and reduce polarization.' A Call to Action The resilience of Montreal’s Jewish community serves as a powerful reminder of the strength that comes from unity and determination. The fight against antisemitism requires more than legal victories or public advocacy—it demands a cultural shift. As Trudeau partied at a concert while Montreal burned, the question remains: will Canada rise to protect its Jewish citizens, or will it allow this wave of hatred to grow unchecked? For now, the Jewish community in Montreal continues to fight—with the courts, with their voices, and with their unwavering commitment to their identity. This is not just a battle for survival—it is a fight to affirm their place as equal members of Canadian society.

IDF soldiers doxxed, threatened with arrest in the Netherlands	The HRF posted the names and photographs of three Nahal Brigade soldiers who were present in the Netherlands on its X account. By World Israel News Staff A pro-Hamas organization revealed the full names and photographs of three IDF soldiers who recently traveled to the Netherlands, demanding that the Dutch government arrest them due to their purported complicity in alleged 'war crimes' in the Gaza Strip. The Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), which is based in Belgium, is dedicated to stalking Israeli soldiers on social media, then revealing their full names and locations when they travel outside of Israel. The organization regularly posts the soldiers' personal details on its X account, which is followed by 15,000 users. Notably, the HRF's founders have referred to Hamas as a 'liberation' force and demanded that the group be removed from the EU's list of terror organizations. Last week, the HRF posted the names and photographs of three Nahal Brigade soldiers who were present in the Netherlands on its X account. Because the soldiers had allegedly been involved in an operation which damaged the Rafah Crossing, they are complicit in 'weaponized famine,' the group said. In November, the HRF doxxed (publicly revealed personally details about) an IDF soldier visiting Cyprus. He was rushed out of the country in coordination with Israel's Foreign Ministry due to concerns that the post could lead to him being targeted by terror organizations. The HRF argues that IDF soldiers' mere presence in the Gaza Strip during the ongoing war is sufficient grounds for their arrests, pointing to the recent ICC warrants issued against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ex-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The organization is particularly focused on Israeli soldiers who hold additional citizenships, particularly those with European nationalities. 'Anti-Israel NGOs have pushed universal jurisdiction cases against Israeli military and government officials for years as a complement to their lobbying for ICC proceedings,' Anne Herzberg, a legal adviser to pro-Israel advocacy group NGO Monitor, told the Jerusalem Post. 'The shift by these groups to the targeting of thousands of lower-ranking dual-national Israelis has two purposes. First, these cases are about generating negative PR – to internationally tarnish the IDF by delegitimizing and criminalizing IDF service,' she added. 'The second purpose is to deter dual nationals from serving in the IDF for fear they might be subject to criminal proceedings if they return to their countries of origin.' South Africa recently pledged to prosecute any of its nationals who had fought in the Gaza Strip.

Biden administration joins France in accusing Israel of violating...	Israeli Foreign Minister rejects accusations IDF broke Lebanon deal, says Israel is enforcing agreement against violations by Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration has warned the Israeli government that its actions against Hezbollah in Lebanon constitute a violation of the nascent ceasefire agreement, Yedioth Aharanoth reported Monday. According to the report, which cited sources familiar with the administration's warning, the White House accused Israel of 'violations of the ceasefire agreement,' including 'visible and audible return of Israeli drones in the skies over Beirut.' The sources called for 'restraint from all sides' to ensure the ceasefire holds. Biden's special envoy to the Middle East, Amos Hochstein, reportedly transmitted the administration's warning to Jerusalem. Earlier, Israeli media outlets reported that France had also accused Israel of violating the truce. Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa'ar (New Hope) pushed back on the accusations, telling French Foreign Minister Jean Noël Barrot Monday that Israel's actions were in response to Hezbollah's violations of the ceasefire, and thus constituted enforcement of the deal, not its abrogation. 'Hezbollah's presence south of the Litani is a fundamental violation of the agreement. They must move north,' Saar told his French counterpart. Israel has also noted that the American-led committee tasked with ensuring that the ceasefire is maintained will not be operational until Tuesday, thus preventing Israel from reporting Hezbollah violations of the ceasefire. Since the ceasefire came into effect last Wednesday, the IDF has reported multiple violations of the truce by Hezbollah terrorists, and has used force on a number of occasions. Under the deal reached last Tuesday, Israeli forces can remain in Lebanese territory for up to two months. A side letter penned by the Bidne administration guarantees that the IDF may freely use force against security threats in southern Lebanon, while threats north of the Litani must first be addressed by the Lebanese army. Only if the Lebanese military is unable or unwilling to response is Israel enabled to act, and it is obliged to inform the U.S. ahead of time whenever possible.

Bereaved father files complaint against ex-IDF chief for inciteme...	Ya'alon's 'statements endanger our heroic soldiers, constitute incitement against the state, and directly harm national security,' says father of IDF soldier killed in the Gaza Strip last year. By World Israel News Staff A police complaint was filed by the father of a fallen soldier against a former IDF Chief of Staff and one-time Defense Minister, who recently accused the Israeli army of committing 'ethnic cleansing' in the Gaza Strip. Itzik Bonzel, an attorney whose son, Amit, was killed in battle in December 2023, asked the police to investigate recent remarks made by Moshe 'Boogie' Ya'alon, which under Israeli law could be considered incitement or intent to harm state security. Ya'alon, who was once the IDF's Chief of Staff and served as Defense Minister nearly a decade ago in a previous government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying in an interview with Democract Tv that the IDF is guilty of ethnic cleansing in the coastal enclave. Speaking to Channel 12, Ya'alon reiterated his remarks, claiming that 'far-right' elements within Netanyahu's coalition were intructing the IDF to 'carry out what are defined as war crimes.' Ya'alon added that the IDF is 'no longer the most moral army in the world.' In a press statemnet after filing the police complaint, Bonzel said that Ya'alon's 'hatred for Netanyahu has driven him mad, but that's his problem. Our problem is that his words amount to incitement and harm to state security.' Bonzel stressed that Ya'alon's 'statements endanger our heroic soldiers, constitute incitement against the state, and directly harm national security.' The bereaved father emphasized that 'the Israel Police and the Shin Bet [must] show the people of Israel that there is no selective enforcement against right-wing activists,' and therefore should 'arrest and interrogate individuals like Ya'alon, [Ehud] Barak, and others.' The attorney urged than 'an indictment be filed against Ya'alon for incitement and harming state security.' 'We will no longer sit idly by and allow people like him to trample on the honor of our heroic IDF soldiers,' Bonzel added.

IDF announces American-Israeli hostage was murdered Oct. 7	Omer Neutra was an IDF officer who was abducted with his tank crew, two of whom have already been declared dead. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF announced Monday that it had enough evidence to declare that American-Israeli lone soldier and hostage Omer Neutra has been dead since Hamas-led forces invaded Israel last October 7. Captain Neutra, 21, was a tank platoon commander in the Seventh Brigade’s 77th Battalion. He was stationed at the 'White House' outpost near the Gazan border when thousands of terrorists broke through the fence and he and his crew joined the battle to stop them. Video taken by the terrorists of the crew being hauled out of their tank was posted online quickly, and their tank going up in flames as jubilant terrorists celebrated around it became one of the iconic images of October 7. The IDF had declared long ago that both tank driver Shaked Dahan and loader Oz Daniel had died in Hamas captivity. On the video itself, a burst of gunfire can be heard and then one soldier is seen lying still on the ground. The whole crew was taken into Gaza. While it was suspected that Neutra had also been murdered, his death was only recently determined by a group of specialists who spent months examining all the findings and information uncovered over the months, and then presented them to the Chief Rabbi who agreed with their professional assessment. The fate of tank gunner Nimrod Cohen, who was seized as well, is as yet officially unknown. His father told Ynet Tuesday that the family has received 'along the way' some unspecified 'indications' that their son is still alive. Neutra’s parents, Ronen and Orna, had addressed the Republican National Convention in July, trying to raise awareness and support for all the hostages. They told the crowd that the soon-to-be reelected president Donald Trump had called the American-Israeli couple personally shortly after their son was abducted along with 250 others during the day the Palestinian terrorists massacred 1,200 people, sparking the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. The couple had just spoken Sunday at a New York rally for the hostages, calling on President Joe Biden and President-elect Trump to combine forces to create a deal enabling all the 101 remaining abductees to return home, including the approximately 40% who are already known to be dead. 'Seize the moment, work together, before January,' they pleaded. 'This can be a moment that unites us all.' Neutra had been born and raised in Long Island but had been 'the most Sabra [Israeli] possible,' his friends said of him. It was 'clear to him,' said his parents, that he would serve in the IDF, even if it meant being far from his parents and brother. Mourning him, Defense Minister Yisrael Katz said Monday, 'Omer, who grew up in New York and chose to immigrate to Israel out of a deep sense of mission, fell in a heroic battle near Nir Oz on October 7, 2023 and was kidnapped to the Gaza Strip by Hamas murderers.' 'Omer's life story and dedication represent the best and strongest of us as a people,' he added. 'A fighter who stood bravely in the battle &#8230; and sacrificed his life for the security of the State of Israel against the worst of our enemies.' The Hostages and Missing Families Forum eulogized Omer as a person 'who loved sports, played soccer, basketball and volleyball and was captain of the teams at school. His family and friends have said that he is a warm, optimistic person who loved people and would ‘light up the room’ whenever he entered.'

UK announces $9m rise in funding for UNRWA	It will come on top of nearly $44 million that the UK has already pledged to transfer to UNRWA this year. By Canaan Lindor, JNS The United Kingdom will add £19 million ($24 million) to its funding for Gaza, with 37% of that sum going to the terror-linked UNRWA aid agency for Palestinians, the government in London announced on Monday. The Foreign Office announced the budget hike in a statement ahead of a visit this week to Egypt, the Palestinian Authority and Israel by International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds. The $9 million addition in funding for UNRWA, whose activity was recently outlawed in Israel because Jerusalem considers it a Hamas instrument, is meant to address humanitarian needs in Gaza, where winter conditions could worsen living standards. It will come on top of nearly $44 million that the UK has already pledged to transfer to UNRWA this year. According to Israel, more than 450 people belonging to terrorist organizations in Gaza, mainly Hamas, were also employed by UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. Critics of UNRWA say its unique definition of a Palestinian refugee, where the status is passed down to the next generation forever, even for people who become citizens of other countries, is designed to undo Zionism. UNRWA officials have denied this. On Oct. 28, the Knesset passed laws banning UNRWA from being present in Israel and outlawing cooperation by Israeli officials with the agency. The remaining $15 million of the $24 million in new funding will be allocated to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the World Food Programme (WFP), the Foreign Office said. This funding, part of a broader £99 million ($126 million) commitment to what the British government refers to as the 'Occupied Palestinian Territories' this fiscal year, is earmarked for health, water and sanitation services, the British government said. Dodds is also set to visit a Palestinian community that 'is subject to settler violence and is at risk of demolition and displacement,' the statement said.

Netanyahu’s wife meets with Trump, discusses plight of hostages	Sara Netanyahu dines with President-elect Donald Trump at his Florida golf club, speaking with the incoming president regarding the plight of hostages held in Gaza, and the 'fight against the axis of evil.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wife, Sara Netanyahu, met with former President and President-elect Donald Trump in Florida Sunday, Mrs. Netanyahu and the Trump campaign's deputy director of communications said Monday morning. Sara Netanyahu is in the midst of a 20-day visit to Miami, Florida, visiting her son, Yair Netanyahu. On Sunday night, Mrs. Netanyahu dined with the incoming president at his Mar-a-Lago Gulf Club. Margo Martin, who served as press secretary during the first Trump administration and Deputy Director of Communications during the 2024 presidential campaign, posted an image of the two at a table in the club's dining hall to X/Twitter. 'President Donald Trump and Sara Netanyahu having dinner at Trump International Golf Course tonight,' Martin tweeted. Mrs. Netanyahu also uploaded the photo to her Instagram account, writing that she had responded to an invitation by the incoming president. 'I attended a dinner meeting at President-elect Donald Trump’s golf club, to which I was invited by him. I congratulated the President on his historic victory in the elections.' The two discussed the plight of Israeli hostages still held captive in the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu wrote, as well as the war against the 'axis of evil.' 'During the meeting, which was warm and friendly, we discussed many topics, including the steadfast friendship between Israel and the United States and the importance of continuing to nurture the unique bond between our nations.' 'I also brought to the President’s attention the immense suffering Israel endured on October 7th and the inhumanity of Hamas terrorists holding our citizens hostage under harsh conditions. I emphasized the urgent need to act for their release and swift return.' 'We also discussed the strategic importance of Israel’s victory in the fight against the axis of evil, for a more stable and secure future in the Middle East and around the world.'

Israel forces Iranian plane to reverse course over Syria	According to a 2022 report by the Alma Research and Education Center, Mahan Air serves as the Islamic Republic’s main cover for transporting weapons. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli fighter jets on Sunday night intercepted an Iranian plane over Syria suspected to be transporting weapons to Hezbollah, forcing it to return to Tehran, according to Hebrew media reports. The operation was part of efforts to maintain the Nov. 27 ceasefire agreement that ended over a year of hostilities between Israel and the Iranian-backed terror group. Israeli Air Force fighter jets. Credit: Israeli Defense Ministry Spokesperson’s Office. The 'Letter of Guarantees,' an annex to the agreement, underscores the United States’ commitment to collaborating with Israel to counter Iran’s destabilizing activities in Lebanon, including halting the transfer of weapons, proxies and materials into Lebanon from Iranian territory. Additional provisions in the two-and-a-half-page U.S.-Israel side deal reportedly include guarantees of Israeli operational freedom against Hezbollah violations of the ceasefire. The Israel Defense Forces is authorized to counter immediate threats in Southern Lebanon, such as observed preparations for a Hezbollah rocket launch, and also to address emerging threats, for example the digging of new tunnels or arms transfers, if Lebanon’s government is unwilling or unable to act. According to a 2022 report by the Alma Research and Education Center, Mahan Air serves as the Islamic Republic’s main cover for transporting weapons. Jerusalem has struck Hezbollah weapons-smuggling operations in Syria numerous times during the war and since the ceasefire took effect. The IAF on Saturday attacked terrorist infrastructure along the Syria-Lebanon border that according to Israel Hezbollah was 'actively using' to smuggle arms. 'The strike was conducted after identifying the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah from Syria to Lebanon, even after the ceasefire agreement, constituting a threat to the State of Israel and a violation of the terms of the truce,' the Israel Defense Forces said. The military accused the Iranian proxy of smuggling weapons through civilian crossing points, with the backing of Syria’s Assad regime. Hours before the ceasefire went into effect last week, Israel for the first time carried out airstrikes targeting Lebanon’s three northern border crossings with Syria. Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, responsible for the terrorist group’s weapons smuggling into Lebanon from Iran via Syria, has been a frequent target of Israeli strikes, according to the IDF. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Jerusalem is constantly monitoring the situation in Syria, after Sunni jihadist rebels over the weekend took control of Aleppo, the country’s second-largest city. 'We are determined to protect Israel’s vital interests and preserve the achievements of the war,' Netanyahu told Israel Defense Forces recruits at the Tel Hashomer induction center in Ramat Gan. 'In this regard, we are strictly enforcing the ceasefire agreement. Every violation is met with a strong IDF response. That has been the case and will continue to be the case. We will maintain Israel’s security.' IDF thwarts ceasefire violations Troops continue to address ceasefire violations as they stay in their positions for the next two months during the gradual drawdown of ground forces in Southern Lebanon. According to the terms of the truce, Hezbollah must retreat north of the Litani River. In the past 24 hours, the IDF conducted operations at multiple locations in Southern Lebanon to neutralize terrorist threats. On Saturday, soldiers eliminated several armed terrorists near a church. Over the past day, IDF troops operated in several locations in southern Lebanon to remove threats to the State of Israel that were in violation of the ceasefire agreement conditions. IDF troops identified several armed terrorists adjacent to a church in southern Lebanon… pic.twitter.com/FbberXLIlT &mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) December 1, 2024 According to the IDF, they were operatives in Hezbollah’s Khiam ground defense, anti-tank missile and artillery units, and had fired at the troops from the church. Israeli forces searched the church following the incident, locating a tunnel shaft containing weapons. 'The IDF remains in Southern Lebanon and acts against any threat to the State of Israel,' the military stated. France accuses Israel of ceasefire violations Paris, a member of the Washington-led monitoring mechanism overseeing the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire agreement, has accused Jerusalem of committing 52 ceasefire violations, according to Hebrew media reports on Sunday which cited French diplomatic sources. The sources alleged that Israel had bypassed the established channels for reporting violations before taking action. The reports also claim that three Lebanese civilians were killed and highlight an increase in Israeli drone activity, claiming that low-altitude flights over Beirut had resumed. Paris is reportedly in ongoing communication with Lebanese Army Chief of Staff Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Najib Mikati to address these developments. 'The Lebanese are fully committed to upholding the ceasefire and preventing Hezbollah from reestablishing its presence in southern Lebanon, but they need time to demonstrate their efforts,' a French official told Ynet on Sunday. According to a separate report by i24NEWS on Sunday, Jerusalem stated that the agreement’s implementation mechanism 'will begin to accelerate' on Monday and Tuesday. An Israeli diplomatic source emphasized that 'any violation will be met with a significant response, as is already happening on the ground.'

Navigating conflict: Pelican tracking aims to reduce bird-aircraf...	Israel’s location at the crossroads of three continents makes it a critical stopover for birds traveling between breeding grounds in Europe and Asia and wintering areas in Africa. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s northern skies are bustling, with pelican migration overlapping with Air Force missions in Lebanon and Syria. To prevent bird-aircraft collisions, the Israeli Nature and Parks Authority and Air Force on Sunday embarked on the most extensive bird-monitoring effort in the nation’s history, equipping 30 pelicans with transmitters to track their migration routes. 'Our skies are among the busiest in the world for both birds and airplanes,' said Ohad Hatzofa, an avian ecologist with the Nature and Parks Authority. 'This naturally creates conflicts between the two.' Israel’s location at the crossroads of three continents makes it a critical stopover for birds traveling between breeding grounds in Europe and Asia and wintering areas in Africa. Each year, hundreds of millions of birds from over 500 species pass through Israel. In recent years, large birds like pelicans frequently trigger radar systems, raising alarms over potential unidentified flying objects. This year, with Israeli airspace particularly congested — in the past year, the Air Force has logged over 11,000 takeoffs for strikes in Lebanon — these misidentifications could pose serious threats to both pilots and wildlife. 'The data we collect will provide invaluable insights into their behavior and help mitigate risks,' Hatzofa explained. Israel plays a critical role in the migration of common pelicans, a species facing mounting threats as their natural habitats shrink. 'Fall 2024 is the peak of the pelican season,' noted Dr. Yariv Malihi, Central District Ecologist at the Nature and Parks Authority. 'They stop here to feed before continuing their journey. As their habitats in places like Turkey dry up or become unsafe due to hunting, Israel has become one of their last refuges.' Recognizing the pelicans’ vulnerability, Israel has taken steps to protect these majestic birds. The Nature and Parks Authority, in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, stocks water bodies with non-edible fish. This strategy provides vital nourishment for the pelicans while reducing conflicts with fish farms. For the Air Force, tracking the pelicans is a matter of safety and operational efficiency. 'Accurately predicting the pelicans’ migration routes allows us to avoid dangerous overlaps between their paths and our flight operations,' said Dr. Yotam Orhan, Head of the Ecology and Ornithology Section at the Air Force. This year has seen over 40,000 pelicans migrate through Israel, with around 2,300 currently present. However, their stay has been notably shorter — about 40% less than in previous years. 'We still don’t know why,' said Dr. Amit Dolev, an ecologist in the Northern District of the Nature and Parks Authority. 'This is one of many questions we hope to answer through our ongoing monitoring efforts.' The transmitters provide a wealth of information, enabling researchers to pinpoint key feeding and resting areas. This data will guide future conservation and operational strategies. Common pelicans are listed as vulnerable in many parts of their range, and Israel’s waterways serve as the pelicans’ last major stop before they embark on a grueling journey across the Sinai and African deserts to their wintering grounds in East Africa.

Israeli hacker faces extradition to the US from Norway	The man was convicted for making some 2,000 calls under a false identity claiming explosives were hidden on planes, causing massive delays. By JNS An Israeli who served seven years in an Israeli prison for hacking a host of American institutions as a minor was arrested last week in Norway and is now facing extradition to the United States, according to Hebrew media reports. The Israeli, who was released from jail after serving seven years of a 10-year sentence, had traveled to Norway and applied for political asylum, according to Channel 12 News. His request was dismissed and he was apprehended in the wake of an extradition warrant filed against him by the FBI in 2017, which Israeli authorities rejected at the time. The man was convicted for making some 2,000 calls under a false identity, including to police stations in major U.S. cities, falsely claiming that explosives had been planted in airplanes, causing emergency landings, the rerouting of flights and the evacuation of thousands of passengers from airports, according to the report. He also hacked into computers in airports, hospitals and Jewish community centers across the United States. Following a joint investigation by the FBI and the Israel Police’s Lahav 433, known as 'the Israeli FBI,' the Juvenile Court in Tel Aviv sentenced him to 10 years in prison in 2017. 'Unfortunately, the United States apparently decided to ‘confirm the kill’ and unjustly demand after a long time the extradition of my client from Norway to the United States, despite the fact that my client has already paid his dues for many years in incarceration,' said the man’s lawyer, Nir Yaslovitzh, according to Channel 12. Israel should do 'everything possible for the immediate release of my client from detention and not turn a deaf ear in the face of the ongoing injustice … waged against him,' he added.

Egypt hosts Hamas in new Gaza ceasefire push, looting halts aid	White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said he thought the chances of a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza were now more likely. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Hamas leaders held talks with Egyptian security officials on Sunday in a fresh push for a ceasefire in the Gaza war, two Hamas sources said, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set to convene his security cabinet on the matter, two Israeli officials said. The Hamas visit to Cairo was the first since the United States announced on Wednesday it would revive efforts in collaboration with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza, that would include a hostage deal. White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said he thought the chances of a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza were now more likely. '(Hamas) are isolated. Hezbollah is no longer fighting with them, and their backers in Iran and elsewhere are preoccupied with other conflicts,' he told CNN on Sunday. 'So I think we may have a chance to make progress, but I’m not going to predict exactly when it will happen … we’ve come so close so many times and not gotten across the finish line.' Residents said the military blew up clusters of houses in the northern Gaza areas of Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, where Israeli forces have operated since October. The military says it has killed hundreds of Hamas terrorists in that part of Gaza as it fights to stop the faction regrouping. It has also lost around 30 soldiers there in combat with Hamas fighters over the past two months, a relatively high death toll. Hamas does not provide details on its own fatalities. The halting of aid deliveries through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing came almost two weeks after a large shipment was hijacked on the same route. UNRWA’s Lazzarini said it was Israel’s responsibility 'as occupying power' to protect aid workers and supplies, and that the humanitarian operation had become 'unnecessarily impossible' due to what he said were Israeli restrictions. COGAT, the Israeli military department responsible for aid transfers, denies it is hindering humanitarian relief into Gaza, saying there is no limit on supplies for civilians and blaming delays on the United Nations, which it says is inefficient.

‘I believe in the justice system,’ Biden says, as he pardons his ...	The pardon, per a White House announcement, relates to any offenses against the country that Hunter Biden 'has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from Jan. 1, 2014 through Dec. 1, 2024.' By JNS U.S. President Joe Biden stated on Sunday night that he hopes Americans will understand why he, as 'a father and a president,' decided to pardon his son Hunter Biden. 'Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively and unfairly prosecuted,' Biden stated. 'Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form,' the president said. 'Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.' Biden and his administration have previously issued very strong statements about gun control and the importance of holding offenders accountable for gun crimes. The pardon, per a White House announcement, relates to any offenses against the country that Hunter Biden 'has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from Jan. 1, 2014 through Dec. 1, 2024.' Those include but are 'not limited to all offenses charged or prosecuted (including any that have resulted in convictions) by Special Counsel David C. Weiss in Docket No. 1:23-cr-00061-MN in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and Docket No. 2:23-CR-00599-MCS-1 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California,' the president added.' Less than a month ago, a reporter asked Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, during a Nov. 8 press briefing about a potential pardon. 'His son, Hunter, is also up for being sentenced next month,' the reporter said. 'Does the president have any intention of pardoning him?' 'We’ve been asked that question multiple times,' Jean-Pierre said. 'Our answer stands, which is no.' 'Everybody in America knew this day was coming,' wrote Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.). David Greenfield, CEO of the Met Council, wrote that the pardon was 'understandable. But now as Democrats, we certainly have no moral high ground for any of the Trump pardons that Democrats objected to.' The 'timing for the Biden pardon of Hunter couldn’t have been worse,' wrote Josh Kraushaar, editor-in-chief of Jewish Insider. Others suggested that Trump would pardon all of the rioters who were at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. 'Joe Biden has always been a venal liar who utilized his political power to pursue familial gain. So, of course, he’s pardoning Hunter,' wrote Ben Shapiro, a prominent Jewish conservative podcaster and writer. 'He was always going to pardon Hunter. Hunter was the bagman.' ‘Tried to break me’ Biden stated on Sunday that the charges against Hunter Biden 'came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.' 'Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the courtroom—with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process,' he said. 'Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter’s cases.' 'No reasonable person, who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases, can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son—and that is wrong,' Biden said. 'In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me—and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.' The president said that he has followed 'a simple principle' for his entire career, which is to 'just tell the American people the truth.' 'They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice—and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further,' he said. 'I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.' Over the weekend, Biden was also photographed carrying an anti-Israel book as he exited a bookstore in Nantucket, Mass.

National Security Minister defends decision to confiscate speakers from mosques which violate noise laws with night-time call to prayer in mixed cities. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli police have begun cracking down on illegal muezzin calls to prayer by mosques in mixed cities across Israel, enforcing noise laws against mosques which violate laws limiting the use of speakers at night. For decades, Israeli mosques across the country have flouted noise restriction laws, which bar noise pollution between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. The use of speaker systems in mixed cities, or by mosques in villages against to Jewish communities, has sparked ongoing complaints, in particular with regard to the night-time and early morning calls to prayer. While multiple efforts to pass legislation banning the use of speakers in houses have worship have failed, in part to due opposition from some ultra-Orthodox lawmakers, existing noise pollution laws enable police to confiscate speakers and public announcement systems used to violate the law. Under the instructions of National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit), Israeli police have been enforcing the law recently in a number of cities and towns, with officers in some instances confiscating mosque speakers. 'The law provides the option to confiscate the audio systems,' Ben-Gvir wrote to the police department in a letter publicized over the weekend. 'It’s an effective tool for deterrence. The moment we use this tool, it will echo across the [Arab] sector.' 'At the end of the day, we need to get results in the field.' The minister is also working to promote legislation which would increase fines against mosques which repeatedly violate the noise pollution law. Multiple Arab lawmakers, including Hadash-Ta'al chief Ayman Odeh and United Arab List (Ra'am) chairman Mansour Abbas, castigated the new directive, calling it a provocation. MK Ahmad Tibi (Hadash-Ta'al), took to X to accuse Ben-Gvir of implementing the policy in order to 'deepen the ongoing oppression of the Arab public.' Ben-Gvir responded on X, defending his decision to enforce the law. 'I received dozens of inquiries from residents in the cities involved, who told me explicitly, you are saving us - keep going. I have no intention of blinking. I tell Ahmed Tibi, Ayman Odeh and Mansour Abbas not to threaten the State of Israel with violence. As they do in Europe, as they do in every reformed country in the world, as they do in Arab countries, we also need to address and enforce the issue of noise in mosques.'

Foreign policy expert says rebel attacks in Aleppo may benefit Is...	Daniel Rakov, an expert on Russian policy in the Middle East and retired IDF colonel, says the attacks in Syria can hinder assistance to Iran and Hezbollah. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Daniel Rakov, a senior research fellow for the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, wrote on X that the rebel attack on Syrian government forces in Aleppo is 'ostensibly good for Israel.' Rakov, an expert on Russian policy in the Middle East and retired IDF colonel, says the attacks in Syria can hinder assistance to Iran and Hezbollah. He wrote, 'The fall of northern Syria to the rebels undermines the infrastructure of both the Iranians and Hezbollah in the region, complicating their efforts to rebuild Hezbollah.' Syrian President Bashar Assad will presumably be more concerned with fighting for the survival of his government than funding terror groups that threaten Israel. 'As Assad becomes more defensive, fighting for the survival of his regime, supporting Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon will take a backseat,' Rakov wrote. Meanwhile, Israel will have more leverage to take action in Syria. Rakov also noted that Moscow, Syria's ally, found the attack by rebels 'very embarrassing.' He said the Russians were surprised by the swiftness of the rebels in Idlib and that Syria will more likely leverage the few Russian forces it has rather than take the time to assist Hezbollah and Iran in its conflict with Israel. Rakov discusses reports that Assad asked Putin for assistance directly and that glide bombs have been transferred to a Russian-operated Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. He adds that Russia is downplaying the Syrian incident in its media and is saying its security is not responsible for the defense failure in Aleppo. Rakov suggests that Israel could leverage the disorder in Syria to attack strategic targets in the country. However, he warned that instability in Syria may lead to a takeover by radical groups such as ISIS and may cause Syria to open the door to Iran as it struggles to seek assistance from Russia and Turkey.

France accuses Israel of violating ceasefire in Lebanon – report	Paris warned both Israel and Hezbollah 'against actions that endanger the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A French diplomatic source reportedly accused Israel of not following the correct procedure for addressing violations in the ceasefire agreement when it struck against a number of Hezbollah targets, according to Kan news. Following this claim, Paris warned both Israel and Hezbollah 'against actions that endanger the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.' Israel has insisted that it will retaliate for violations against the terms of a ceasefire agreement, including Hezbollah's unauthorized transfer of weapons. In the ceasefire agreement is a 'side letter' signed by the US and Israel that would give the Jewish State the right to enforce the deal and defend against emerging threats from Hezbollah. The letter acknowledges Israel's right to act militarily if the terms of the agreement are broken, although, beyond southern Lebanon, it can only do so in coordination with the Lebanese army. The letter also stipulates that Israel must inform the US before taking military action to address infractions. The Kan report also indicates that Paris claims Hezbollah has violated the ceasefire as well. When the Lebanon ceasefire agreement was announced last week, Israel requested that France not be granted a role in the monitoring of the agreement, given the country's position on the ICC arrest warrants issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. However, since the Lebanese side insisted on France's involvement, a compromise was reached in which the US would enforce the agreement, and France would have a lesser role in monitoring its enforcement. According to the agreement, Hezbollah would be required to withdraw its forces from the Israeli border and north of the Litani River. The group would also be obligated to disarm, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Additionally, a U.S.-led committee would be tasked with monitoring compliance with the ceasefire. Lastly, Israel would retain the right to take military action in Lebanon in response to violations of the ceasefire, but only after the committee has exhausted all efforts to restore peace. The agreement would unfold in three stages: In the first stage, a ceasefire would take effect, during which Hezbollah would withdraw from the southern bank of the Litani River. In the second stage, Israeli forces would pull back from Lebanese territory. Finally, in the third stage, Israel and Lebanon would enter negotiations over disputed border areas.

Syrian rebels seize control of Aleppo in surprise offensive	Damascus has since attempted to regain control through air power, with both Syrian and Russian warplanes launching strikes on rebel positions in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. By Jewish Breaking News Syrian opposition forces stunned government troops this weekend with a lightning offensive that has captured most of Aleppo. According to CNN, the attack began with rebels sweeping through villages east of Aleppo, meeting unexpectedly light resistance. On Saturday morning, armed fighters were celebrating in Aleppo’s central square, with video showing them waving opposition flags and shouting 'God is great' in Arabic. By Saturday evening, rebels had seized both the city’s airport and its historic citadel. Except for a few northeastern neighborhoods still held by government forces and Iranian militias, most of Syria’s second-largest city has been captured by rebel forces. The opposition implemented a 24-hour curfew, claiming it was necessary to protect residents and property. Damascus has since attempted to regain control through air power, with both Syrian and Russian warplanes launching strikes on rebel positions in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. The Syrian Defense Ministry confirmed these joint operations, targeting what they termed 'terrorist gatherings and supply lines.' At least one airstrike near al-Basil roundabout resulted in civilian casualties, including severe burn victims. As the situation evolved, Kurdish forces exploited the chaos to expand beyond their traditional two neighborhoods, leading to clashes with the rebel alliance. Some opposition groups now threaten to target Kurdish-held territories in northern Aleppo province. The timing of this offensive appears strategic, coming as Syria’s key ally Russia remains focused on Ukraine and Iran faces increasing pressure from Israeli operations. If the rebels successfully oust President Bashar al-Assad, it could reshape the future of Syria, a nation whose civil war has claimed over 300,000 civilian lives since it began during the 2011 Arab Spring.

Israeli High Court approves military burial in civilian cemetery ...	A decorated soldier with a 20-year career in the Israel Air Force, Dagan served as a combat navigator during the Second Lebanon War and later in Unit 8200 of the Intelligence Directorate as a reservist. By Pesach Benson, TPS In a landmark ruling, Israel’s High Court of Justice on Sunday approved a military burial in a civilian cemetery for Maj. (res.) Asaf Dagan, an Israel Air Force navigator who committed suicide in October after battling severe post-traumatic stress disorder. The decision follows a legal struggle between Dagan’s family and military authorities over burial rights and recognition. Traditionally, Israeli military regulations reserve full military burials in military cemeteries for soldiers who die while on active duty. 'In light of the complexity of the issue from legal, human, public, and moral perspectives, the court proposed a compromise,' the High Court said in its ruling. A decorated soldier with a 20-year career in the Israel Air Force, Dagan served as a combat navigator during the Second Lebanon War and later in Unit 8200 of the Intelligence Directorate as a reservist. Despite struggling with PTSD, his family noted that he consistently fulfilled his reserve duties. Dagan, 48, shot himself on October 23. The ruling sets a precedent for recognizing the lingering impacts of military service, such as PTSD even after soldiers leave active duty. The Defense Ministry and the Israel Defense Forces have committed to further discussions with Dagan’s family to resolve outstanding issues, including the placement of a military tombstone, Dagan’s inclusion on the IDF’s memorial website, and the organization of an annual remembrance ceremony. PTSD is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. People with PTSD may avoid situations or things that remind them of the traumatic event, and they may have negative changes in beliefs and feelings. The condition is typically managed with therapy and medication. Since Hamas’s October 7 attacks, the clinic at Tel Aviv University’s National Center for Post Trauma & Resilience say they have been flooded with a weekly average of 40 new requests for treatment.

Can AI understand medical complexity? Israeli researchers questio...	Most AI models, including those specifically trained on medical datasets, performed poorly, often no better than random guessing. By Pesach Benson, TPS As the integration of artificial intelligence into medicine advances, there is also a growing interest in using AI models to interpret complex medical information, a step beyond AI’s traditional medical uses. AI’s current medical tasks are more about task automation and pattern recognition, used in applications such as chatbots that answer patient queries, algorithms predicting disease, synthetic data generation for privacy, and educational tools for medical students. But despite these strides, interpreting medical information involves a higher level of comprehension and distinction of complex medical concepts and comes with life-or-death consequences. A study recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Computers in Biology and Medicine by researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev sheds new light on the performance of AI models in deciphering medical data, revealing both their potential and significant limitations. Doctoral student Ofir Ben Shoham and Dr. Nadav Rappaport from the university’s Department of Software and Information Systems Engineering conducted a study to evaluate how effectively AI models comprehend medical concepts. They developed a dedicated evaluation tool called 'MedConceptsQA,' which includes over 800,000 questions spanning various levels of complexity. This tool was designed to assess the models’ ability to interpret medical codes and concepts, such as diagnoses, procedures, and medications. Questions in *MedConceptsQA* were categorized into three levels of difficulty: Easy, requiring basic medical knowledge; medium, demanding a moderate understanding of medical concepts; and difficult, which tested the ability to discern nuanced differences between closely related medical terms. The results were surprising. Most AI models, including those specifically trained on medical datasets, performed poorly, often no better than random guessing. However, some general-purpose models, such as ChatGPT-4, outperformed others, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 60%. While better than random, this performance still falls short of the precision required for critical medical decisions. 'It often seems that models specifically trained for medical needs achieve accuracy levels close to random guessing. Even specialized training on medical data does not necessarily translate to superior performance in interpreting medical codes,' said Rappaport. Interestingly, general-purpose AI models like ChatGPT-4 and Llama 3-70B outperformed specialized clinical models, such as OpenBioLLM-70B, by 9–11%. This highlighted both the limitations of current clinical models and the adaptability of general-purpose models, despite their lack of a medical focus, the researchers said. The study shows that AI models need more specialized training on diverse, high-quality clinical data to better understand medical codes and concepts. This could lead to the development of more effective AI tools. With further advancements, AI could help in triaging patients, recommending treatments based on medical history, or flagging potential errors in diagnoses. The findings also suggests that AI models need better training to handle the complexity of medical coding, which could streamline administrative tasks and improve efficiency in healthcare systems. 'Our benchmark serves as a valuable resource for evaluating large language models’ abilities to interpret medical codes and distinguish between concepts,' explained Ben Shoham. 'It allows us to test new models as they are released and compare them with existing ones.' The post Can AI understand medical complexity?

Trump pushing for Gaza ceasefire by January 20th – report	Senator Lindsey Graham, an ally of President-elect Donald Trump, warns Israeli leaders not to assume Trump will back plans to annex, resettle Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff President-elect Donald Trump has signaled that he wants Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire deal by the time he enters office on January 20th, a senior Republican lawmaker and Trump ally said last week. In a report published last Friday by Axios, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said that the 45th president - and soon to be 47th - has repeatedly said that he wants to see a deal freeing the remaining 101 Israeli hostages and ending the war in Gaza reached by inauguration day next month. 'Trump is more determined than ever to release the hostages and supports a ceasefire that includes a hostage deal. He wants to see it happening now,' Graham was quoted as saying. 'I want people in Israel and in the region to know that Trump is focused on the hostages issue. He wants the killing to stop and the fighting to end.' Graham, a pro-Israel figure in the upper chamber of Congress, expressed optimism that the Biden administration can cooperate with the Trump transition team to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. The senator spoke with Axios after returning to the U.S. following a pair of trips to the Middle East, during which he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Turning to plans proposed by Israeli government ministers to resettle and annex the Gaza Strip, Graham warned against assuming they would have the incoming president's support. 'I think he should talk to Trump and hear what he wants,' Graham said of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who last month called for Israel to adopt a policy of promoting voluntary mass emigration of Arabs from Gaza. 'If you haven't spoken to him, I wouldn't put words in his mouth.' 'The best insurance policy against Hamas is not an Israeli reoccupation of Gaza but a reform in the Palestinian society. The only ones who can do that are the Arab countries.'

After aid convoys looted by armed gangs of Gazans, UNRWA announces it has halted transfer of aid to Gaza through the primary crossing from Israel. By World Israel News Staff The United Nations relief agency tasked with supporting Palestinian Arabs has halted the transfer of aid to the Gaza Strip via the primary border crossing between Israel and the coastal enclave, following a spate of looting incidents. On Sunday, Philippe Lazzarini commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) took to X/Twitter to announce that his agency has suspended aid transfers to Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing. 'We are pausing the delivery of aid through Kerem Shalom, the main crossing point for humanitarian aid into Gaza,' Lazzarini wrote. Lazzarini noted that an entire convoy of food trucks was looted by armed Gazan gangs after entering the Strip on Saturday, adding that this was not the first time aid convoys had been hijacked or looted en masse. 'The road out of this crossing has not been safe for months. On 16 November, a large convoy of aid trucks was stolen by armed gangs. Yesterday, we tried to bring in a few food trucks on the same route. They were all taken.' 'This difficult decision comes at a time hunger is rapidly deepening. The delivery of humanitarian aid must never be dangerous or turn into an ordeal.' Blaming Israel for the 'breakdown in law and order' in the Gaza Strip, which was ruled by the Hamas terror organization prior to Israel's invasion, Lazzarini tasked the IDF with providing security to aid convoys carrying goods into Gaza. 'The responsibility of protection of aid workers + supplies is with the State of Israel as the occupying power. They must ensure aid flows into Gaza safely & must refrain from attacks on humanitarian workers.' 'I call once again for a #ceasefire that would also secure the delivery of safe & uninterrupted aid to people in need.'

Trump taps Kash Patel as nominee for FBI director	Patel has served as chief of staff to the acting Secretary of Defense and has held roles in counterterrorism and intelligence operations. By Jewish Breaking News President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Kash Patel as his nominee for FBI Director. Patel, a former federal prosecutor and key figure in Trump’s first administration, is known for his aggressive stance against government bureaucracy and promises sweeping changes, including the creation of a transparency office to release records on the JFK assassination, 9/11, and similar events. Patel rose to prominence while working as an aide to Rep. Devin Nunes on the House Intelligence Committee, playing a key role in challenging the Russia investigation. He later served as chief of staff to the acting Secretary of Defense and has held roles in counterterrorism and intelligence operations. Patel’s vision for reform includes shutting down the FBI’s J. Edgar Hoover Building, reopening it as a 'museum of the Deep State,' and dispersing agents nationwide to focus on criminal investigations. He has criticized the misuse of classification systems as a tool to conceal corruption. With his deep ties to Trump’s agenda and his track record in intelligence and law enforcement, Patel’s nomination is seen as a game-changer for the FBI’s future direction. document.createElement('video'); The post Trump taps Kash Patel as nominee for FBI director appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/trump-taps-kash-patel-as-nominee-for-fbi-director/	2024-12-01T03:47:15-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/shutterstock_2270821397-scaled.jpg
‘Without the civil squads I wouldn’t be here’: The fight to equip...	Friday’s event was complete with stands and booths giving away everything from tactical gear and vests to gifts, clothes, and school for the children of squad members, also came complete with food, live music, and speeches. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Understaffed, undersupplied, underfunded, and overworked, local Israeli civilian security teams were forced to battle heavily armed Hamas terrorists on October 7. Since then, they have been forced to do everything from providing security for their communities during an ongoing war to putting out forest fires sparked by daily Hezbollah missile barrages. In the face of these challenges, two Israeli nonprofits, Civil Squads of Israel and Israel Support Bridge, came together with around 1,500 members of the security teams and their families for an event on Friday morning, to provide some badly needed equipment, and express appreciation. 'For some, it’s one of the only times they’re able to get together and have a good time with their family in safety since October 7,' Alon Tirer, one of the founders of Civil Squads of Israel, told The Press Service of Israel. Before the October 7 attacks, members of kitot konenut — as they are known in Hebrew – were trained in basic military and first aid skills and equipped, in theory, to handle threats until security forces arrived. However, many civil defense squad members didn’t have enough helmets, vests, weapons, and more. Friday’s event was complete with stands and booths giving away everything from tactical gear and vests to gifts, clothes, and school for the children of squad members, also came complete with food, live music, and speeches. 'The [Israel Defense Forces] are here to protect us, but we must recognize that in the critical first minutes, the local defense force will often stand alone,' said former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett at the event. 'If four individuals managed to fend off dozens of terrorists, imagine what a platoon with machine guns, reserve training days, and a properly funded security coordinator could achieve – nothing could overcome them,' he added. For that reason, one of the main focuses of the event was enabling civil defense squad members to stock up on gear, Tirer explained. 'People can choose for themselves whatever equipment they like. It’s shopping for free,' he told TPS-IL. The two nonprofits have done significantly more than that over the past year. While Civil Squads of Israel is on the ground providing gear and training to the individual kitot konenut, Israel Support Bridge is known for its connections with donors, recipients and various government bodies. 'After October 7, I reached out to all the people I knew,' Ben Mammon, founder and CEO of Israel Support Bridge, told TPS-IL. Mammon quickly began talking to people on the ground, different organizations, and government ministries, organizing a database of Israel’s wartime needs and figuring out how to get it to the right people. One of those people was Nir Alon, founder and CEO of Civil Squads of Israel. Born and raised in Kibbutz Sufa in the Gaza border region, Alon survived October 7 in a shelter at the kibbutz, and attributes his survival to the sacrifice of his community’s security team. 'During the attack there were only four people in the civil squad in Sufa, only four rifles with no scopes,' Alon recalled. 'Without the civil squads I wouldn’t be here, so I took this very seriously and realized that something needs to be done,' Alon said. Since then, Civil Squads of Israel has launched trainings and supply drives across the country, training and equipping Israel’s frontline civilian responders in firefighting, first aid, and self-defense. But needing help, Alon turned to Israel Support Bridge and its supply chain. 'Before long I had a full 747 plane land in Israel under my name, and after that two planes every week,' Mammon explained. The partnership 'enables buying in bulk: medical equipment, vests, firefighting support, whatever people need. The mechanism was always the same, working together, accumulating the resources, and getting the project done. Ultimately, we’re two big nonprofits working together towards the same goal,' Tirer said. 'Its’ one of those cases where one plus one is ten.'

EU’s anti-Israel foreign minister steps down	Josep Borrell was a fierce critic whose last statements demanded that all EU states enforce ICC arrest warrants against Israeli leaders. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Josep Borrell, the EU’s ‘foreign minister,’ stepped down Saturday as his five-year term came to an end, causing most Israelis to breathe a sigh of relief. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy had been a fierce critic of the Jewish state, especially over its conduct of the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Some detractors call the Spanish politician 'obsessed' with Israel, rather than focusing on problems much closer to home. Ynet counted Borrell’s posts about the Palestinians and Israel and found that in the last nine months he had tweeted 127 times about it, twice as many as about the Ukraine-Russia war on the EU doorstep that has the real potential of spilling over into neighboring, member states. The posts are full of condemnations of Israeli 'massacres' and other unproven allegations, with barely a nod to the fact that Hamas sparked the ongoing war by brutally massacring 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians, and taking 251 hostage in a surprise invasion last October 7, with 101 still being held captive. He has also called for concrete action to be taken to put pressure on the Jewish state to end the war and the 'humanitarian crisis' in the enclave. At an EU foreign ministers’ meeting earlier this month, Borrell proposed the suspension of political dialogue with Israel and a ban on importing 'products from illegal settlements' due to its alleged human rights violations in the Gaza Strip, which Jerusalem strongly denies. It did not pass because such decisions must be unanimous, and several states did not support the motion, including Germany, Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic. As his final act, on Thursday Borrell said all EU member states must 'support fully the International [Criminal] Court' and not 'undermine' its arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant on war crimes charges relating the Israel-Hamas war. Several EU members have said they will not arrest the two if they visit, including Hungary and France. Borrell also castigated Israeli society, saying it was 'being colonized from the inside by extremism and violent people.' The outgoing foreign minister has been leading the effort to financially sanction Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria on the basis of unproven accusations of harming Palestinians in the region, following the lead of the Biden administration. Former prime minister of Estonia Kaja Kallas, who is considered much more amenable to Israel, will be the EU’s new foreign policy chief.

Israeli minister issues ultimatum on hostage deal, pushes for tra...	Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir says Netanyahu starting to warm up to idea of encouraging Arab emigration from Gaza, warns his party could bolt government if current Gaza ceasefire deal under consideration is accepted. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's National Security Minister warned that his party would not accept the outline for a ceasefire deal with Hamas currently under consideration, hinting that his faction would bolt Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government if it were to be accepted. Speaking with Army Radio on Sunday, Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) pushed back against a new proposal, presented by an Egyptian delegation, for a limited ceasefire and hostage deal. According to reports last week, the deal would include a two-month truce in the Gaza Strip, the release of some number - possibly several dozen - of the 101 captives still held in the Gaza Strip, and a parallel release of hundreds of jailed Palestinian Arab terrorists held by Israel. The plan marks a significant change from prior proposals, in that Israel would not be obliged to agree to a permanent end to the war, though the new outline would provide for talks during the two-month ceasefire for a long-term cessation of fighting in Gaza. Ben-Gvir, however, objected to the release of large numbers of jailed terrorists in exchange for only some of the remaining Israeli captives, saying the new proposal was 'irrelevant' as far as he is concerned, hinting Otzma Yehudit would bolt the government should the deal be accepted. 'I believe that a reckless deal that would release 1,000 prisoners from the Sinwar group is a severe blow to the State of Israel. Stop misleading the public; this is not even on the table as far as Hamas is concerned,' Ben-Gvir said. 'The deal currently being discussed does not bring back all the hostages. To retrieve all the hostages, the war must completely stop, and secondly, 1,000 prisoners from the Sinwar group would have to be released.' Ben-Gvir intimated that Prime Minister Netanyahu would not agree to the deal over Otzma Yehudit's opposition. 'I am not willing to accept the deal currently being proposed. The terms being discussed are irrelevant to me—and the Prime Minister does not want Otzma Yehudit to leave the government.' Netanyahu, Ben-Gvir continued, 'understands politics very well.' Late last month, Ben-Gvir cast the sole vote in Israel's security cabinet opposing the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. The ceasefire deal was passed by the security cabinet by a margin of 10-1, with the backing of Ben-Gvir's election ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party). In Sunday's interview, Ben-Gvir called for long-term Israeli control of the Gaza Strip, the restoration of Jewish settlement in the area, and a policy of encouraging voluntary Arab emigration or 'transfer' from the coastal enclave. 'Ideas like the resettlement of Gaza have my blessing. The only times we defeated our enemies were when we took land from them. But for me, that’s not enough—I also want to encourage migration, for them to voluntarily emigrate to their countries.' Ben-Gvir suggested that Prime Minister Netanyahu, who in the past has publicly opposed plans to transfer Gaza's population, is now starting to warm to the idea of encouraging voluntary mass emigration. 'And you know what? I’m working hard with the Prime Minister to advance the encouragement of migration from Gaza—and I’m starting to see a certain openness from him on this matter.' 'I’m saying that he is showing openness to something he previously opposed, and I think the time has come to do such a thing.'

IDF laying groundwork for long-term control of Gaza Strip – repor...	Two military bases and a north-south buffer strip have joined the Netzarim and Philadelphi roads over the last several months. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF zones that the army’s engineers have created within the Gaza Strip over the last year show that it’s serious about maintaining security control of the enemy territory for at least the medium-term, the Swiss Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) reported Friday. By examining satellite imagery, the daily drew a clear picture of the new roads and infrastructure Israel has built in order to help the army’s efforts against the Hamas terrorists, as well as ensure security for Israeli citizens after the war is over. Only a few weeks into the ground incursion into Gaza, which began in late October, 2023, troops started blowing up the buildings within a kilometer of the border to create a buffer zone for the kibbutzim and moshavim whose fields and home came within meters sometimes of the original fence. By now, reported NZZ, approximately 90% of a north-south, kilometer-wide strip has been razed to the ground. The Philadelphi Corridor on the Egyptian-Gazan border that had been the main smuggling route for Hamas weaponry, both over and under the ground, has been turned into a constantly patrolled, two-lane, paved road, enabling the IDF to shut down this 'oxygen pipeline,' as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dubbed it. The biggest project has been the Netzarim Corridor, which cuts completely through the Strip about a third of the way down from its northern tip, through the outer parts of Gaza City. The seven-kilometer-long road is wide, well-paved, and protected by earthen embankments in certain sections on either side. There are also watchtowers and at least two army bases dotting its flanks. Buildings have been steadily demolished all around the road to a form a secure zone five to six kilometers wide. The corridor started as the answer to a tactical need but is now 'a strategic element,' Mitvim think-tank president Nimrod Goren told the paper. 'It also serves to divide the territory, to control the movement of the Palestinian population, to enable ongoing action against Hamas infrastructure and to show that Israel will not be leaving any time soon.' This differs, for example, from several short access roads from Israeli territory, mostly to heavily populated areas like Gaza City, Khan Younis and Rafah, that have also been constructed. Security experts NZZ interviewed said these were likely only tactical in nature, to ease army operations, and would not be maintained long-term. Despite its importance to Israeli security, even the well-built southern road may not become a permanent fixture, according to Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies in King's College London. 'Given the international significance of the Philadelphia corridor – where the interests of Israel, Egypt and the U.S. converge – this issue is likely to be resolved through negotiations,' he told NZZ. The Biden administration has maintained that Israel cannot remain as an occupying power in Gaza after Hamas has been destroyed, and that no land could be subtracted from the Palestinians as a result of the war. Netanyahu has said Israel would not reoccupy Gaza, but that no matter who runs the coastal entity in the future – something far from being settled as yet – Israel would have to retain 'security responsibility' there so that the residents of the south can live there safely again. His national-religious coalition partners are of a different opinion, saying that Israel should resettle areas evacuated in the 2005 unilateral Disengagement, as they believe this is the only way to successfully maintain Israel’s security in the long term. On Thursday, Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party joined them, saying that 'Jewish settlement here is the answer to the terrible [Oct. 7] massacre and to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.' Some 53% of Jewish Israelis support the reestablishment of Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip, according to the 'Peace Index' survey released by Tel Aviv University in January.

Israelis in Thailand facing high threat of terror attacks	A number of Iranian plots to harm Israelis abroad have been thwarted in recent years by the Mossad and other Israeli intelligence agencies. By World Israel News Staff Israelis currently vacationing in Thailand were urged to remain vigilant, as the 'terrorist infrastructure' which orchestrated the murder of an Israeli rabbi in the United Arab Emirates are seeking to harm Israelis in the southeast Asian nation, according to Israel's National Security Council (NSC). 'Current intelligence indicates that the terrorists responsible for the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan in Dubai&#8230;have been planning further terrorist activity,' read a statement from the NSC. The NSC warning may refer to Iran, which has formally denied responsibility for Kogan's slaying, but is believed by some Israeli security officials to have organized the murder. A number of Iranian plots to harm Israelis abroad have been thwarted in recent years by the Mossad and other Israeli intelligence agencies. The warning that terrorist elements are actively plotting to attack Israelis in Thailand comes two weeks after the Mossad specifically warned Israeli tourists to avoid the famous Full Moon Party, due to the threat of attacks. Thailand is an extremely popular vacation destination for Israelis, with hundreds of thousands visiting the country annually. Some Thai islands, such as Ko Samui, have small Israeli expat communities. Israelis must 'avoid attending large-scale events associated with Israel, with an emphasis on those announced in advance, or places of entertainment and gathering associated with Israel. Notify local security forces if you are exposed to hostile activity targeting Israelis,' the NSC said. The NSC told Israelis to be 'extra alert in public places,' such as restaurants, hotels, and bars. The agency also advised Israelis to hide symbols of their Jewish and Israeli identities, as well as avoid mentioning their military service or posting details of their vacation - such as the names of their hotels - on public social media profiles.

Kidnappers murdered UAE rabbi after botched abduction – report	Uzbeki kidnappers had planned to smuggle Rabbi Zvi Kogan across the border into Oman but murdered him after their abduction plan went awry, according to Wall Street Journal report. By World Israel News Staff The suspects responsible for the abduction and murder of a rabbi in the United Arab Emirates had planned to transfer him across the border to Oman, but killed him after their plans went awry, according to a report published by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday. On the morning of November 21st, Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a dual Israeli-Moldovan citizen serving as aide to the chief rabbi of the United Arab Emirates and the proprietor of a kosher grocery shop in Abu Dhabi, was abducted and driven in his own car by his kidnappers towards the border with Oman. Days later, his remains were found in his car en route to the border, with clear signs he had been murdered. Relatives and friends who spoke with the Journal said Rabbi Kogan's death was 'a bloody end,' without offering details. According to Sunday's report, the three suspects linked to the killing had planned on smuggling the 28-year-old rabbi over the border - alive - to Oman, but were ultimately foiled. It remains unclear what prevented the three Uzbeki nationals linked to the case from crossing the border with Rabbi Kogan, leading to his murder. UAE security forces arrested the three suspects last week, just days after Rabbi Kogan was declared missing. The UAE's Ministry of the Interior identified the three suspects as Olembay Toyirovich, 28, Mahmoud Abd Rahim, 28, and Azizet Kamalovich, 33, and released a photograph of three in custody. Some Israeli officials cited by Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, have speculated that while the abduction and killing bear the hallmarks of a terrorist organization, the terror cell responsible may not be linked to Iran.

Former Israeli defense minister accuses Israel of ‘ethnically cle...	Moshe Ya'alon, a former member of the Likud who served as Defense Minister under Netanyahu after stint as IDF chief of staff, accuses Israeli government of promoting 'occupation, annexation, ethnic cleansing of Gaza.' By World Israel News Staff A former Israeli defense minister and ex-member of the ruling Likud party accused the Israeli government over the weekend of working towards the 'ethnic cleansing' of the Gaza Strip. Speaking with Democrat TV on Saturday, Moshe Ya'alon accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition government of planning to occupy, then annex, the Gaza Strip, restore Jewish settlement in the coastal enclave, and ethnically cleanse it of Palestinian Arabs. 'The path we are being dragged down is one of occupation, annexation and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip,' Ya'alon said. 'Transfer, call it what you want, and Jewish settlements.' Ya'alon claimed that a majority of Israelis reject proposals by members of the Israeli government to maintain long-term Israeli control over the Gaza Strip, to resettle the area, or to promote voluntary migration of Palestinian Arabs. 'Now look at the polls. Seventy percent — sometimes more and sometimes a little less — of the public in the State of Israel advocates a path that is Jewish, democratic, liberal etc., and also with separation.' 'Therefore, there must be no confusion here. The one who wants to confuse us is the one who is currently leading us to nothing less than destruction.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls by some of his ministers, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) to apply Israeli sovereignty over the Gaza Strip, to resettle the area, or to pursue the voluntary transfer of the Arab population. When the host, Arab-Israeli journalist Lucy Aharish, pushed back on Ya'alon's claims of ethnic cleansing, the former general doubled down on his accusation. 'What is happening there? What is happening there? There is no Beit Lahia, there is no Beit Hanoun, [the IDF] is currently operating in Jabalia and are essentially cleansing the area of ​​Arabs.' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar (New Hope), a long-time rival of Netanyahu who recently joined the government, castigated Ya'alon over his comments, tweeting: 'The irresponsible comments of former minister Moshe Ya’alon are incorrect and slander Israel without a basis. I call on him to retract his comments.' Ya'alon, 74, was a career officer in the IDF, serving in the military from 1968 until his retirement in 2005. He rose to the rank of lieutenant general and served as chief of staff from 2002 to 2005, when he resigned in protest over the Gaza Disengagement plan. Four years later, Ya'alon entered politics, running on the Likud ticket and serving as Strategic Affairs Minister and Defense Minister under Prime Minister Netanyahu from 2009-2013 and 2013-2016 respectively. After his tenure as defense chief, however, Ya'alon became a fierce critic of Netanyahu, leaving the Likud and forming the Telem party, which later ran on a joint ticket with Benny Gantz's Blue and White party. During 2023, Ya'alon frequently joined protests against the judicial reform plan, accusing the Israeli government of behaving like a 'dictatorship of criminals.'

Sirens activated in central Israel due to Yemen-launched missile	Sirens heard in central cities near airport, Jerusalem suburb for first time since Hezbollah ceasefire came into effect. By World Israel News Staff Air raid sirens warning of incoming missile fire sounded throughout central Israel on Sunday morning, breaking several days of relative quiet following the implementation of a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. According to an Israeli army statement, the sirens were activated by a ballistic missile launched from Yemen by Houthi terrorists, who are backed by Iran. The IDF said that the missile had been successfully intercepted outside of Israel's borders, but the alarms sounded due to concerns of falling shrapnel. Sirens sounded in major cities including the central cities of Modi'in, Lod, which is near Ben Gurion Airport, and Beit Shemesh, a Jerusalem suburb. Hebrew-language news outlet Mako reported that Magen David Adom paramedics were treating several people who had been hurt while running to bomb shelters, as well as a number of individuals who were suffering from acute anxiety. Last week, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi said the Hezbollah ceasefire should inspire other Shia terror groups in the region to attack Israel. 'It is important to build on what was achieved on the Lebanese front and move toward further escalation [against Israel], particularly from Iraq and Yemen,' al-Houthi said. Since the outbreak of the October 7th war, the Houthis fired more than 200 explosive drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles at Israel. The group has often exaggerated the results of these launches, including falsely claiming to hit sensitive sites such as the Nevatim Air Base in southern Israel. In June, one Houthi-launched drone managed to reach Tel Aviv and crashed some 200 meters away from the American consulate, killing an Israeli man. 'The Yemeni Armed Forces will carry out more military operations against the Israeli enemy in triumph for the blood of our people in Palestine and Lebanon, and will not stop supportive military operations during the coming days until the Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon stops,' Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said in a statement following a missile in launch in September, which was intercepted and caused no injuries or damage.

Iran leveraging ceasefire to rebuild Hezbollah – report	After the terror group's heavy losses in the recent conflict, it is more dependent than ever on Iranian support to survive. By World Israel News Staff Iran is using the current ceasefire as an opportunity to rebuild and rearm Hezbollah, its largest proxy group on Israel's northern border, as well as activate other Shia militias in the region to attack Israel. Despite bombastic statements from Hezbollah declaring victory over Israel, Iran views the terror group has having lost to Israel, as over 4,000 of its members were killed and thousands more were wounded. While some have suggested that Iran may cut its losses and focus on its other proxy groups - such as the Houthis in Yemen and various Shia militias in Iraq and Syria - one Iran expert noted the long-term investment that Tehran has made in Hezbollah. 'The Iranian relationship with Hezbollah doesn’t end with this defeat to Israeli forces,' Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at London’s Chatham House think tank, told the Post. 'This is a relationship that was nurtured and cultivated over decades. The relationship will certainly live on.' Within Hezbollah, there is some lingering anger over Iran's lack of direct intervention to spare the terror group from heavy losses during the conflict with Israel. Though Iran flew Hezbollah terrorists for treatment in Iranian hospitals after the beeper explosions, Iran did not directly attack Israel in order to save the terror group. Many in Lebanon have expressed anger over Hezbollah for bringing Iranian influence into the country and its parliament, in which Hezbollah's political branch has representatives. Hezbollah loyalists have argued that the terror group is a Lebanese-born 'liberation group,' aiming to protect Lebanon from Israeli aggression. But after the terror group's heavy losses in the recent conflict, it is more dependent than ever on Iranian support to rebuild. 'Iran is prepared to allocate funds for reconstruction and to ensure Hezbollah’s survival, as well as to maintain support within the Shiite community,' a person with inside knowledge of Hezbollah's internal politics told the Washington Post. 'However, this support is now more directly under Iranian influence,' he added, explaining that Hezbollah believes Iran will send field agents to ensure that the funding is being used properly, as well as to provide military training to surviving members of the terror group.

Mother of hostage: UN ceasefire resolution would have been a ‘dea...	The UN recently attempted to pass a ceasefire resolution that did not include a demand for the release of the hostages. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Mandy Damari, mother of British-Israeli citizen Emily Damari, described the UN's proposed ceasefire as a 'death sentence' for the hostages still in Gaza. Speaking at a rally on Saturday night at the Sha'ar Hanegev Junction, Damari described traveling to Geneva and meeting with United Nations, Red Cross, and Human Rights Council officials. She recounted being at the UN on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, 'a day dedicated to standing against injustice. Yet, if there's any place where injustice is overlooked, and falsehoods thrive, it's here.' Damari said, 'The UN recently attempted to pass a ceasefire resolution that did not include a demand for the release of the hostages. If not for the US veto, that resolution would have passed—and it would have effectively been a death sentence for our loved ones. Hamas would have had no incentive to release them.' She continued, 'We told the UN what they didn't want to hear: they're failing. The Red Cross has failed. Not one hostage has received humanitarian aid, not one has been visited, and not one family has gotten any sign of life. If these organizations had done their jobs, our loved ones would be home by now. Instead, we're met with excuses, false support, and empty promises.' Damari said she was flying to the UK and would ask government officials why they supported the UN resolution. Currently, Emily Damari is the only British citizen left of the 101 hostages remaining in Gaza. Speaking of the British government, Damari said, 'They told me three weeks ago they would fight for her. So where is that fight now? Were they actually speaking the truth when they told me they are fighting for her to return home?'

High-ranking UAE official attends Rabbi Zvi Kogan’s shiva	During the shiva call, Nuaimi stressed that his country will continue to seek coexistence and will not let extremists threaten this goal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, a senior representative of the United Arab Emirates, arrived in Jerusalem on Friday to pay his respects to terror victim rabbi Zvi Kogan, Israel Hayom reports. Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi visited the Kogan family sitting shiva, a seven-day Jewish mourning observance. During the shiva call, Nuaimi stressed that his country will continue to seek coexistence and will not let extremists threaten this goal. 'The state and its citizens are more committed than ever to the values of openness and peace and will increase their efforts to ensure that Rabbi Zvi's legacy continues and that all communities live in harmony in the UAE,' the senior official said. Former Israeli Ambassador to the UAE, Amir Hayek, joined Nuaimi's visit to the Kogan family home. On Sunday, following the discovery of Rabbi Kogan's body, Emirati Ambassador to the United States Yousef Al-Otaiba said in a statement, 'Our thoughts are with his family, friends, and community over his senseless death. Zvi Kogan's murder was more than a crime in the UAE – it was a crime against the UAE. It was an attack on our homeland, on our values, and on our vision.' 'In the UAE, we welcome everyone. We embrace peaceful coexistence. We reject extremism and fanaticism of every kind. We honor Zvi Kogan's memory by recommitting ourselves to these values.' 'Now, we are more determined than ever to protecting and sustaining the Emirates as a shining and enduring example of diversity, acceptance and peace.' Last Thursday, 28-year-old Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan, who served as an aide to the chief rabbi of the UAE and operated a kosher grocery shop in Abu Dhabi, was declared missing. Over the weekend, his body was found by UAE security personnel in a suspected terror attack.

IDF announces new ultra-orthodox brigade to launch during Chanuka...	The goal is to grow the Hashmonaim Brigade's number of combat soldiers to a unit of 60 to 80 with ultra-orthodox reserve soldiers engaged in extended training. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF announced the launch of an entirely ultra-orthodox combat unit called the Hashmonaim Brigade on Chanukah, Ynet reports. The release on Chanukah is appropriate, given that the Hasmonaim historically was the dynasty that led the Maccabean revolt against the Syrian-Greeks, commemorated during the Chanukah holiday. The brigade includes 30 pre-screened recruits, with dozens of others expressing interest in joining. The goal is to grow the Hashmonaim Brigade's number of combat soldiers to a unit of 60 to 80 with ultra-orthodox reserve soldiers engaged in extended training. The Hashmoniam focuses on voluntary recruitment of ultra-orthodox soldiers following a dialogue with heads of yeshivas and community rabbis rather than through compulsory enlistment, as occurred with the 7,000 recently issued draft orders in the ultra-orthodox community. The focus is on fostering trust between the ultra-orthodox community and Israel's military with a commitment to assisting and requiring the religious troops to adhere to their strict religious observance. The soldiers are expected to practice modest speech, use only filtered cell phones, and wear their traditional ultra-orthodox attire at prayer and meals. Any violation of these rules will result in dismissal from regular army service. All training will occur within the Hashmonaim Brigade to avoid intermingling with other units and a relaxation of standards. Col. Avinoam Emunah, commander of the Hashmonaim Brigade, told Ynet, 'I have the privilege of commanding the ultra-Orthodox brigade and being part of this extraordinary project that has the potential to bring meaningful change to Israeli society and the Jewish people as a whole.' 'For the first time since the founding of the IDF and the establishment of the state, we've created a brigade that allows the ultra-Orthodox community to enlist, fight and serve while preserving their way of life and their identity. I invite you—those who feel the calling to defend their land, their people and their country—to join us and take part in something historic, something unprecedented. Be part of the beginning of this blessing,' he added.

IDF strikes Syria and Lebanon citing ceasefire violations	The IDF vowed to deal swiftly with any violations of the ceasefire agreement, including the transfer of weapons. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Saturday, the IAF struck targets in Syria and Lebanon, citing violations of the days-old ceasefire agreement. The strike in Syria took place close to the border in Lebanon, which Israel said Hezbollah was using to transfer weapons. In a statement, Israel's military said, 'The action was taken after identifying the transfer of weapons from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon, which continued even after the ceasefire agreement. This transfer represents a threat to the State of Israel and violates the terms of the ceasefire.' Syrian media said the strikes occurred close to the al-Qusayr area, although Israeli sources didn't specify what kind of facilities were hit. The IDF vowed to deal swiftly with any violations of the ceasefire agreement, including the transfer of weapons. 'The IDF will continue to act to remove any threat to the State of Israel that violates the terms of the ceasefire agreement,' the military added. The strikes come as instability erupts in Syria with insurgents breaching Aleppo. Israel's military also struck at observed ceasefire violators in Lebanon as they noticed Hezbollah terrorists loading a car with RPG, ammunition boxes, and other military equipment. The IDF also noticed Hezbollah terrorists in a building that the terrorist group previously used. Also on Saturday, the IAF struck at a facility near Sidon, which Hezbollah used to store rocket launchers. The IDF carried out a drone strike 'deep within Lebanon' against a vehicle at a facility Hezbollah used to manufacture missiles. Israel's military in Lebanon also discovered a cache of weapons stored at a mosque. They also dismissed Hezbollah terrorists spotted in the no-go area in Southern Lebanon. Lebanese media also accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire agreement and claimed an Israeli drone attacked a car in the southern village of Majdal Zoun, wounding three people.

Prison escapee convicted of passing UK military secrets to Iran	While Khalife claimed most information he shared was fabricated or publicly available, prosecutors used evidence from his phones, notes, and surveillance footage to prove he had gathered and shared real classified information. By Jewish Breaking News A former British soldier who made headlines with a daring escape from a London prison was convicted Thursday of spying for Iran. Daniel Khalife, 23, was found guilty by a jury in Woolwich Crown Court of violating Britain’s Official Secrets Act and Terrorism Act. The 23-year-old joined the Army at 16, serving in the Royal Corps of Signals, a communications unit working with battlefield troops and special forces. He received NATO secret security clearance during a joint exercise at Fort Cavazos in Texas in early 2021, during which time he shared intelligence information with his Iranian handlers. British security only learned of his Iranian contacts after he approached MI6, anonymously offering to work as a double agent. He claimed he had earned his handlers’ trust and received $2,000 in a dog poo bag in a north London park. While Khalife claimed most information he shared was fabricated or publicly available, prosecutors used evidence from his phones, notes, and surveillance footage to prove he had gathered and shared real classified information. They also showed he traveled to Turkey to meet a contact. In his testimony, Khalife said he had contacted people in the Iranian government after he got the idea from watching 'Homeland,' a Showtime television drama about CIA operations and espionage. His defense lawyer, Gul Nawaz Hussein, characterized Khalife’s James Bond aspirations as naive and stupid, bordering on slapstick. He said his client was more 'Scooby Doo' than '007.' Despite the seemingly amateur nature of his actions, Counter Terrorism Commander Dominic Murphy of the Metropolitan Police stressed Khalife’s dangerousness. 'We know very well the threat that Iranians pose to the U.K.’s national security,' Murphy said. 'He’s the ultimate Walter Mitty character who was having a significant impact in the real world.' The case gained widespread attention after Khalife’s September 2023 prison break, when he escaped from Wandsworth Prison by strapping himself under a delivery truck. After a massive three-day search, authorities caught him on a canal path. His escape exposed broader issues in Britain’s aging, overcrowded prison system, prompting an ongoing inquiry into how he managed to escape and whether he had help. Though Khalife owned up to his prison break during the proceedings, his denials of espionage fell flat with the jury. 'He surreptitiously sought out and obtained copies of secret and sensitive information which he knew were protected and passed these on to individuals he believed to be acting on behalf of the Iranian state,' said Bethan David of the Crown Prosecution Service. 'The sharing of the information could have exposed military personnel to serious harm, or a risk to life, and prejudiced the safety and security of the United Kingdom.'

Maccabi Tel Aviv plays soccer game in empty Hungarian stadium ami...	The match on Thursday was Maccabi Tel Aviv’s first game in Europe since its fans were violently attacked in The Netherlands during the late hours of Nov. 7 and into the early hours of the following morning. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel Aviv played a UEFA Europa League match on Thursday against their Turkish rivals Besiktas in an empty stadium in Hungary, which was closed to supporters likely due to security concerns following the recent attack on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam. Maccabi won the match 3-1 in the Nagyerdei Stadium in Debrecen, Hungary, during the fifth week of the UEFA Europa League. Gavriel Kanichowsky secured Israel’s lead in the 23rd minute with a goal, but Besiktas struck back in the 38th minute with a goal by Rafa Silva to tie the score. Maccabi Tel Aviv took the lead again right before halftime by scoring another goal in added time. The Israeli club finished 3-1 with Weslley Patati’s goal in the 81st minute. Groups of police patrolled outside the venue and the game concluded with no incident, according to the Associated Press. On Nov. 11, days after the attack against Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam, the European soccer body UEFA announced that this week’s match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Besiktas, which was originally scheduled to take place in Istanbul, would be moved to Hungary 'following a decision by the Turkish authorities not to stage it in Turkey.' Hungary, which has hosted several home games for Israel’s national soccer team since the start of the Israel-Hamas war last year, agreed to host the match and UEFA said it 'will be played behind closed doors following a decision of the local Hungarian authorities.' Maccabi Tel Aviv coach Zarko Lazetic said after Thursday’s match that playing in front of an empty stadium was hard for the team. 'We play football because of the fans, to give them some pleasure, some excite(ment) and to be together,' he explained, as reported by the AP. The match on Thursday was Maccabi Tel Aviv’s first game in Europe since its fans were violently attacked in The Netherlands during the late hours of Nov. 7 and into the early hours of the following morning. After the team competed against the Dutch club Ajax in a UEFA Europa League game in Amsterdam, anti-Israel gangs chased Israeli fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv through the streets of Amsterdam, ran them over with cars, physically assaulted them, and taunted Israeli soccer fans with anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian slogans such as 'Free Palestine.' Five people were reportedly hospitalized for injuries. Leaders in Israel and Europe condemned the premeditated and coordinated attack as antisemitic. Amsterdam’s mayor called the attackers 'antisemitic hit-and-run squads' and said the assailants were going 'Jew hunting.' Police in Amsterdam said they have already identified, investigated, and even arrested 45 suspects in connection to the incident. Following his team’s loss on Thursday to Maccabi Tel Aviv, Besiktas President Hasan Arat resigned from the soccer club, citing 'personal reasons.' He was elected president in December 2023. Earlier this week, former Premier League goalkeeper Brad Friedel was fired as sporting director of the Turkish team after having the job for only five months.

UK, France, Germany vow to continue nuke talks with Iran	According to a November report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Tehran had 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since its last report in August. By Amelie Botbol, JNS Britain, France and Germany have agreed to continue nuclear negotiations with Tehran following a meeting on Friday in Geneva and amid threats by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to reinstitute a 'maximum pressure' campaign on the Islamic Republic once he assumes office in January. Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister and senior nuclear negotiator Majid Takht-Ravanchi met with top diplomats from the European nations, known collectively as the E3. The talks came after the European countries joined the United States to have Iran censured by the U.N. atomic watchdog for its lack of cooperation. The resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency’s 35-nation Board of Governors notes an 'essential and urgent' need for Iran to provide 'technically credible explanations' for the uranium traces at undeclared facilities. It also urges the IAEA to compile 'a comprehensive and updated assessment on the possible presence or use of undeclared nuclear material in connection with past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran’s nuclear program.' According to a November report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Tehran had 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since its last report in August. This level of enrichment is a technical step short of 90% enrichment, considered weapons grade. Iran condemned the censure as 'politically motivated' and announced the launch of 'new advanced centrifuges' to produce additional enriched uranium. Last week, Britain’s foreign intelligence chief said that Tehran’s nuclear ambitions posed a major global threat. 'Iran’s allied militias across the Middle East have suffered serious blows,' said Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) chief Sir Richard Moore, adding, 'But the regime’s nuclear ambitions continue to threaten all of us.' Similarly, the head of France’s DGSI intelligence service warned of the risk of Iran’s nuclear breakout, noting that Paris and London were preparing for such an eventuality. 'Our services are working side by side to face what is undoubtedly one of the threats, if not to say the most critical threat, in the coming months—the possible atomic proliferation in Iran,' Nicolas Lerner said. 'The intelligence will be crucial to enable our authorities to make the right decisions and define the right strategies.' In an interview with The Guardian newspaper published on Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that his country was considering altering its nuclear policy. The threat came after an adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said earlier this month that Tehran has the capacity to develop nuclear weapons, should it choose to do so. 'We now have the technical capabilities necessary to produce nuclear weapons,' Kamal Kharrazi told the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen outlet. In May, Kharrazi told the ISNA news agency: 'If the Zionist regime dares to damage Iran’s nuclear facilities, our level of deterrence will be different. We have no decision to produce a nuclear bomb, but if the existence of Iran is threatened, we will have to change our nuclear doctrine.' In August, Iran International reported that the Islamic Republic was advancing its secret nuclear program, bringing the mullahs closer to building atomic bombs. Three independent sources in Iran told the London-based opposition media outlet that the regime was moving forward with its nuclear weapons program 'by restructuring the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), retaining Mohammad Eslami as the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and resuming tests to produce nuclear bomb detonators.' The Biden administration privately warned Tehran in June about its research and development activities, Axios reported on July 17, citing three Israeli and U.S. officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Jerusalem would do 'everything' to stop Tehran from acquiring the bomb. 'I will do everything to prevent it from becoming a nuclear [power], I will use all the resources that can be used,' the premier said. Earlier this month, Netanyahu told a Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee meeting that Israel would review its ability to act against Iran once the Trump administration takes over. During his first term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Obama-era accord more commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, which he said did not sufficiently prevent a pathway to an Iranian bomb. In October, Israeli airstrikes on Iran destroyed a secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin, 19 miles southeast of Tehran, according to Axios. The clandestine site held sophisticated equipment used for testing explosives needed to detonate nuclear devices.

Netanyahu, Gallant should turn themselves in, ICC spokesman tells...	This week, Netanyahu decided to appeal to the ICC against the decision to issue the arrest warrants. By Amichai Stein, JNS 'The suspects can decide to appear on a voluntary basis and surrender to the ICC. They have all the rights of the defense that are guaranteed, including the presumption of innocence.' That’s what Fadi El Abdallah, the spokesperson and head of the Public Affairs Unit at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, told JNS when asked what is expected now from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, now that the ICC has issued warrants for their arrest on charges of genocide. 'There is an arrest warrant that has been issued for the individuals, and it is the legal obligation of the states that are parties to the Rome Statute to cooperate with us,' El Abdallah continued. (Israel is not a party to the treaty that established the court—A.S.) But how is it possible, JNS asked, that only Israeli leaders are standing trial in connection to the Gaza war (an arrest warrant was also issued for Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, but he is dead). ICC Spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah. Credit: Academy for Cultural Diplomacy/Facebook. 'The ICC is checking if during a war crimes have been committed, and who is responsible. Even in wars there are rules that need to be applied to everyone,' El Abdallah said. 'The judges simply decided based of the evidence and based on the rules.' Will U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to sanction all those involved in the arrest warrants affect the court’s decision, JNS asks. 'The ICC has a legal mandate and we have to fulfill it. There are 124 states that gave the ICC a specific mandate to serve justice and to serve victims, and we have to fulfill our duty. We cannot take any political matters into consideration. We can only look at things with total independence and impartiality,' the spokesman responded. But still, JNS asked, you see countries such as France and Germany saying they won’t arrest Netanyahu and Gallant. You cannot say this doesn’t damage the court credibility or authority. 'As I said,' El Abdallah replied, 'no political matters can be taken into consideration. The judges are independent and impartial and will only decide based on the applicable legal rules and the evidence that are before them.' If there are requests of the ICC in relation to the implementation of its decision, they have to be raised with the judges, who will then decide on them, the Lebanese spokesperson added. A state commission of inquiry? Some in Israel claim that if only there were a state commission of inquiry into the events of Oct. 7, 2023, and its aftermath headed by the president of the Supreme Court, the arrest warrants would not have been issued. 'The arrest warrants have been issued,' the ICC spokesperson said. 'They cannot be withdrawn unless by the judges themselves based on a strong legal argumentation. If there is a request to the ICC judges, then they will have to check if all the conditions are met. But the general rules are that there is a need to establish that there are indeed genuine investigations for the same individuals and for the same alleged actions as indicated by the [ICC] decision.' Israel is not one of the 124 countries that signed the Rome Statute. This simple fact raised many eyebrows: How can the court put on trial the leaders of a country that is not within its jurisdiction? 'The ICC does not prosecute states, but it persecutes individuals for alleged criminal responsibility,' El Abdallah told JNS. 'The ICC jurisdiction covers the Palestinian territories, so Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and that means that when the state of Palestine ratified the Rome Statute [in 2015], if crimes are committed by anyone on the territory of Palestine, they can be prosecuted.' JNS then asked: You understand that the Israeli public sees the arrest warrant decision as antisemitic and anti-Israel, especially as it’s based on the decision, which was widely criticized, of the Palestinian Authority joining the court. The prestige of the judicial system? MK Simcha Rothman, who chairs the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, told JNS, 'I think it is very, very clear that it would not have mattered whether Israel had established a state commission of inquiry or whether it would have established a civil committee. 'Essentially what the spokesperson is claiming is that an investigation on the suspicious of genocide or crimes against humanity should have been opened [by Israel] against Gallant and Netanyahu—which of course no country would do. And of course, this shows that the claims of supporters of the [Israeli] judicial system, that the prestige of the judicial system could save us from the ICC, are untrue,' Rothman said. This week, Netanyahu decided to appeal to the ICC against the decision to issue the arrest warrants. 'I think there is no need to appeal. The very act of appealing to the ICC judges gives it treatment it does not deserve,' Rothman told JNS. 'This is an illegitimate body, and it should be treated as such. And we should act diplomatically with countries and use this incident as an opportunity to take steps against both the court and the perpetrator of the trial in the court, which is the Palestinian Authority.' Rothman said this is a golden opportunity to weaken the ICC. 'By imposing sanctions and delegitimizing the court, it will cause more countries to leave the court. Many people understand that this step will be used against them as well, so it should be used to harm the court,' he said. Amichai Stein is the diplomatic correspondent for Kan 11, IPBC.

Hamas may give up on crucial demands for hostage release – NYT	According to reports, Hamas might allow the IDF to occupy the Philadelphi corridor temporarily, something that was a key demand of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but Hamas considered a non-starter. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The New York Times on Thursday reported that Hamas may be willing to drop crucial demands for a hostage-ceasefire agreement. According to the Times, Palestinian and US leadership said they believed that Hamas might allow the IDF to occupy the Philadelphi corridor temporarily, something that was a key demand of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but was considered by Hamas to be a non-starter. In the last few months, Hamas has rejected any hostage release proposal that doesn't include Israel agreeing to an immediate and permanent withdrawal of military forces from Gaza. Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that the group 'appreciates' Lebanon's right to reach an agreement that protects its people and expressed hope for a deal that would end the war in Gaza. 'Hamas appreciates the right of Lebanon and Hezbollah to reach an agreement that protects the people of Lebanon, and we hope that this agreement will pave the way to reaching an agreement that ends the war of genocide against our people in Gaza,' Abu Zuhri stated. Following the implementation of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, US special envoy Amos Hochstein said, 'The Lebanese deal here opens an opportunity on the hostage deal,' he said. 'They [Hamas] wake up this morning at 4 am with Hezbollah, that used to be actively supportive of Hamas in the northern front, cutting a deal and ending that conflict.' In addition to the ceasefire in Lebanon, the death of Sinwar and uncertainty over the future of Hamas's leadership have created a widespread perception that Hamas may be more amenable to a hostage and ceasefire deal. The Times also cited the role of Iran and indicated that since much of the Islamic Republic's air defense systems were damaged by Israeli airstrikes, they may be unwilling to confront Israel. The victory of President-elect Donald Trump was cited as another factor in Iran's reluctance to attack Israel, and it may be more likely to rein in its proxies, such as Hezbollah and Hamas. There are also reports that after a year of war, Hamas has lost its grip on Gaza and that increasing numbers of Gazan civilians are turning on the terror group.

Two terrorists were involved in the shooting at Giti Avisar junction, one of whom was shot dead by security forces and the other is currently being pursued. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A terrorist who opened fire at an Israeli bus stop on Friday near the settlement of Ariel was eliminated by Israeli security forces. Two terrorists were involved in the shooting at Giti Avisar junction, one of whom was shot dead by security forces and the other is currently being pursued. The two terrorists were armed with assault rifles and began shooting suddenly at civilians. Magen Dovid Adom reported that of the eight wounded, four were hit with gunfire, including three in serious condition and one in moderate condition. The remaining people were injured through impact with broken glass. Magen David Adom paramedic Itamar Hakhamov described the scene: 'We arrived in large numbers and found casualties near the bus, fully conscious and suffering from gunshot wounds.' 'We quickly administered initial medical care and transported them to the hospital in stable condition. Other MDA teams treated individuals with shrapnel injuries from broken glass and also evacuated them with minor injuries,' he continued. This is a developing story.

Thousands attend pro-Israel rally in Amsterdam	Naomi Mestrum, the director of the Center for Information and Documentation Israel, a Dutch-Jewish group, thanked Christians for Israel for standing up for Jews and called on others to follow suit. By Canaan Lindor, JNS Thousands of people protested against antisemitism and in support of Jews and Israel on Thursday, at gathering in Amsterdam organized by Christian Zionists and Jewish groups. Police removed several anti-Israel protesters who showed up to confront the crowd at the so-called Stopera complex near the city’s Waterloo Square. The event was headlined 'Together against Jew-Hatred.' The Israel supporters waved Israeli and Dutch flags at the demonstration co-organized by Christians for Israel. Frank van Oordt, the NGO’s director, was one of the speakers who referenced the series of assaults by dozens of Muslims on Israelis returning from a soccer match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax in Amsterdam on Nov. 7. 'We see attempts to blame the Jews for violence against them and we are sick of it,' said van Oordt, whose father, Karel, founded Christians for Israel in 1979. 'We are standing by our Jews now, we do so proudly and we will not stand by as hatred is incited again against them.' Several of the attendees blew a shofar as others applauded van Oordt. Naomi Mestrum, the director of the Center for Information and Documentation Israel, a Dutch-Jewish group, thanked Christians for Israel for standing up for Jews and called on others to follow suit. 'Everyone should be standing by the Jewish people now,' she said. 'We are done talking. The authorities need to show up.' Esther Voet, the editor-in-chief of the Dutch-Jewish weekly NIW, noted that organizers reminded the demonstrators not to display the Israeli flag while leaving the demonstration for fear of attacks. Several speakers criticized Mayor Femke Halsema for revoking the permit the city gave the event’s organizers to hold the protest at Dam Square, a central point where many of the Nov. 7 assaults happened, and have it moved to the less central Stopera area. Halsema, a former leader of the far-left GroenLinks ('GreenLeft') party, cited public order concerns. Last week, Halsema retracted her initial use of the word 'pogrom' to describe the Nov. 7 assaults, where the perpetrators’ violence, use of the term 'Jew hunt' to describe their actions, and level of coordination shocked many witnesses. In recent weeks, politicians on the Dutch left repeated a narrative in which the Israelis instigated or provoked the violence. The victims and many witnesses dispute these allegations.

Israel extends waiver allowing Palestinian banking ties	Israel’s National Security Council said that severing banking ties with the PA would have 'significant negative consequences' for Israel’s security and foreign relations. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Security Cabinet on Thursday night extended a waiver allowing Israeli banks to cooperate with Palestinian ones for another year. The waiver allows Israeli banks to process shekel payments for services and salaries associated with the Palestinian Authority without running afoul of laws against terror-funding and money laundering. Palestinian banks process PA stipends for imprisoned terrorists and their families. Israel came under heavy US and European pressure as diplomats argued that without the waiver, the Palestinian Authority economy would collapse. An opinion presented by Israel’s National Security Council said that severing banking ties with the PA would have 'significant negative consequences' for Israel’s security and foreign relations, warning such a move would increase Palestinian terror financing and money laundering. The new waiver expires at the end of November 2025. The Palestinian Authority allocates seven percent of its annual budget for its so-called 'Martyr’s Fund,' which provides the stipends. The size of the monthly payouts is primarily determined by the duration of the terrorist’s incarceration, with a negligible additional factor based on family size. Ramallah has been paying out stipends for years, but the issue came under a spotlight following the murder of Taylor Force, a U.S. citizen killed by a Palestinian who went on a stabbing rampage in Jaffa in 2018. Congress passed the Taylor Force Act, which halted U.S. aid to the Palestinians as long as terror stipends are being paid out. U.S. assistance to the Palestinian Authority resumed under the administration of President Joe Biden. In December 2022, American victims of Palestinian terror filed a lawsuit against the President and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, arguing that the payments violate the Taylor Force Act. Despite claiming to be operating at a 172% budget deficit, the Palestinian Authority in July recognized 899 new prisoners from Gaza and tens of thousands more Gaza 'martyrs' as eligible for the 'pay for slay' payouts.

Trump team claims credit for Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire	The Biden administration had reportedly been in collaboration with the Trump team as the president-elect continues the transition process to the White House. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner Key members of the incoming Trump administration are taking credit for the newly announced ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, arguing that the Jewish state and the Lebanese terrorist group agreed to the deal in response to US-President-elect Donald Trump’s election victory earlier this month. 'Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump,' US Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL), Trump’s incoming White House national security adviser, said on X/Twitter. 'His resounding victory sent a clear message to the rest of the world that chaos won’t be tolerated. I’m glad to see concrete steps towards deescalation in the Middle East.' While celebrating the ceasefire, Waltz also warned that Iran, which backs Hezbollah, remains the main obstacle in securing long-standing peace in the Middle East. 'But let’s be clear: The Iran Regime is the root cause of the chaos & terror that has been unleashed across the region. We will not tolerate the status quo of their support for terrorism,' Waltz added. Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal on Tuesday that took effect on Wednesday, effectively ending a 14-month period of war between the two parties. The agreement, brokered by the US and France, will allow roughly 70,000 Israelis to return to their homes in the northern portion of the Jewish state after having been displaced by barrages of missiles, rockets, and drones from Hezbollah. Estimates suggest that Hezbollah fired between 100-200 missiles into northern Israel nearly every day since the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s massacre across southern Israel last Oct. 7. The ceasefire agreement will allow for intensified diplomatic efforts in Gaza, where Israel has been embroiled in an ongoing war with Hamas since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks. Addressing the press from the White House Rose Garden, Biden touted the new pact between Israel and Hezbollah. However, the president cautioned that Israel retains the right to retaliate should the terrorist group launch another attack against the Jewish state. 'Let’s be clear. Israel did not launch this war. The Lebanese people did not seek that war either. Nor did the United States,' Biden said. 'This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,' Biden added. 'What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed to threaten the security of Israel again.' The Biden administration had reportedly been in collaboration with the Trump team as the president-elect continues the transition process to the White House. Waltz and Jake Sullivan, the outgoing national security adviser, had reportedly been in communication regarding the White House’s efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. However, the Biden administration has said that none of Trump;s senior foreign policy team directly participated in the ceasefire negotiations. US Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) also credited Trump for the truce. 'I appreciate the hard work of the Biden administration, supported by President Trump, to make this ceasefire a reality,' Graham wrote on social media. Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank, posted on social media that 'Iran is pulling back to regroup ahead of Trump coming into office.' 'It’s a combination of Israeli military success and Trump’s election — the ayatollah has no clothes and he knows we know,' Goldberg said.

Gaza resettlement the answer to Oct. 7 massacre, ICC case, Israel...	Some 53% of Jewish Israelis support the reestablishment of Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip, according to the 'Peace Index' survey. By JNS Resettling the Israeli towns that were destroyed as part of the 2005 disengagement from Gaza is the answer to the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas massacre and the ICC case against the Jewish state’s leaders, Israeli Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf said on Thursday. Writing on X after a visit to the Gaza border with Zionist activist Daniella Weiss, Goldknopf—the head of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism Party—said that 'Jewish settlement here is the answer to the terrible [Oct. 7] massacre and to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.' The haredi leader noted that the ICC, 'instead of caring for the 101 captives [still held by Hamas after 419 days], chose to issue arrest warrants against the prime minister and the [former] defense minister.' In the post, Goldknopf shared a picture of himself and Weiss with a map of prospective Jewish communities to be established in the Gaza Strip. סיירתי היום בישובי חבל עזה. ההתיישבות היהודית כאן היא התשובה לטבח הנורא והתשובה לביה״ד הבינלאומי בהאג שבמקום לדאוג ל-101 החטופים בחר להוציא צווים נגד ראש הממשלה ושר הבטחון. pic.twitter.com/01GGVwcS1d &mdash; השר יצחק גולדקנופף (@DOVRUTGoldknopf) November 28, 2024 On Nov. 13, Weiss entered the enclave to scout potential locations for Jewish communities on behalf of her Nahala Movement, which works to establish new communities throughout the Land of Israel. Weiss, known for her leadership in the Gush Emunim movement, has been actively promoting a plan for resettling the Strip. Her organization has prepared six settlement nuclei involving hundreds of families. She told Kan News last week, 'We are no longer waiting for authorization. The moment entry is possible, we enter. We don’t wait for water supply infrastructure, generators or any other preparations. If 300 people enter at once, evacuating them would require 1,000 soldiers.' In August, Israeli security forces arrested six youths after dozens tried to breach the border to conduct a Jewish morning prayer service in Gaza. The attempt to enter the enclave came as resettlement activists marked 19 years since the military carried out the disengagement from Gaza, in which more than 8,000 Jews were forcibly removed from their homes in the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria. In August 2005, the Israeli government headed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon unilaterally disengaged from Gaza, removing thousands from their homes and transferring them to within the Green Line. While the move was designed to bring calm to Israel’s southern border, it ushered in a victory for Hamas in January 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council elections. In June 2006, the terrorist organization seized power in the Strip and evicted the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. During its Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of the northwestern Negev, Hamas murdered some 1,200 people and wounded thousands more. It also took around 250 civilians and soldiers back to Gaza as hostages. Some 53% of Jewish Israelis support the reestablishment of Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip, according to the 'Peace Index' survey released by Tel Aviv University in January of this year. Five months ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out the possibility of civilians returning to the enclave. 'If you mean resettling Gaza, … it was never in the cards, and I said so openly. And some of my constituents are not happy about it, but that’s my position,' the Israeli leader said in a May 21 interview with CNN.

Former hostage Mia Schem is engaged one year after her release	Mia Schem was one of 117 hostages who were released in November 2023 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, coinciding with a week-long pause in fighting. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Thursday, former hostage Mia Schem is engaged to be married to Yinon Hason just one year after she was released from captivity. Mia Schem was one of 117 hostages who were released in November 2023 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, coinciding with a week-long pause in fighting. Terrorists abducted her from the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, 2023. Mia Schem was shot in the arm while trying to flee Hamas terrorists on October 7th after seeing that they set her car on fire. 'It was a split-second decision, whether to stay put and burn to death or go with him,' she said. Mia was thrown onto the back of a pickup truck and was given a makeshift splint. In Gaza, a veterinarian operated on her arm with no anesthetic and told her that she was going to die a hostage. Schem described Gaza civilians she encountered in captivity as 'terrorists' who abetted in her abuse. 'I went through a Holocaust,' Schem said. 'Everyone over there is a terrorist.' 'It was important for me to reflect on the true situation of the people living in Gaza – who they are, and what I went through there.' 'These are families under Hamas. In retrospect, I suddenly realized that I was with a family. Suddenly, I started asking myself why I was in a family’s house? Why are there children here? Why is there a woman here?' Regarding the terrorist guarding her Mia Schem said, 'His wife was outside the room with the children,' she said. 'That was the only reason he didn’t rape me.' The dual French and Israeli citizen described being starved and bullied by the terrorist’s family as the guard didn’t take his eyes off of her as she sat in a darkened room. Mia Schem described the ordeal, 'I (was) closed in a dark room, not allowed to talk, not allowed to be seen, to be heard, hidden.' She added, 'There is a terrorist looking at you 24/7, looking.' Mia Schem told of her fear of being raped and burst into tears. 'There is fear of being raped, there is fear of dying.' She continued, 'His wife hated the fact that he and I were in the same room. You feel like you want a hug, you know, woman to woman, to break down a bit.' 'That’s all you had there. But she was so mean, she had such mean eyes.'

Housing Minister Goldknopf inspects proposed Israeli settlements ...	In 2005, 9000 Israelis were evacuated from 25 settlements in Gaza, and since then, many Israelis have advocated for a renewing a Jewish presence in the region. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Housing and Construction Minister Yitzchak Goldknopf said that he inspected the sites of proposed future Israeli settlements in Gaza. On X, Goldknopf posted a picture of himself with Daniella Weiss, the head of the Nachala Settlement Movement, holding up a map of plans for settlements in Gaza. The minister has advocated Israelis establishing homes once again in the Gaza Strip. In 2005, 9000 Israelis were evacuated from 25 settlements in Gaza, and since then, many Israelis have advocated for a renewing a Jewish presence in the region. In his tweet, Goldknopf wrote, 'Today, I toured the Gaza Strip settlements. Jewish settlement here is the response to the horrific massacre and a response to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which, instead of focusing on the 101 hostages, chose to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense.' Goldknopf did not enter Gaza but inspected the territory through binoculars. In another post on X, Nachala thanked Minister Goldknopf for his willingness to 'tour and observe the future settlement locations in Gaza.' The post continued, 'Together, we will build Jewish cities in Gaza, which will help lower apartment prices across the country, with the understanding that without settlement, there is no security. Gaza is ours, forever.' According to Hebrew media, some IDF soldiers, without permission from their superiors, let Weiss in to investigate sites for future Israeli settlements in Gaza. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that Israel should re-occupy Gaza and 'encourage' the Arabs living there to relocate. At a conference in August, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that if there had still been Jewish settlements in Gaza, the October 7 terror attack would never have happened. At the 10th Katif Conference for National Responsibility held Monday, Smotrich said, 'If there had been Jewish settlement in Gush Katif, the [October 7] massacre would not have happened.' He added that Israel's disengagement from Gaza turned Hamas into a 'terror monster.'

Would-be Trump assassin Ryan Routh echoes Democratic rhetoric, ca...	The 58-year-old has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial at a federal detention center in Miami. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Ryan Routh, the second person to attempt to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump, sent Politico a letter from jail that echoes Democratic rhetoric and calls Trump a 'dictator.' In the four-page letter, written before the presidential election, Routh warned that if Trump were to win, the United States needed to 'remove the power of our military by the President and place it with Congress before January.' 'We must limit all Presidential power before Trump seizes our country,' Routh wrote. Routh attempted to assassinate Trump at the then-candidate's West Palm Beach, Fla., golf course in September but fled the scene without firing his weapon after the Secret Service spotted him. The 58-year-old has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial at a federal detention center in Miami. Trump blamed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for inspiring Routh's attempt, citing Biden's and Harris's campaign-trail claims that he is a 'threat to democracy.' '[Routh] believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,' Trump said. 'Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country—both from the inside and out.' Routh praised himself and previous would-be assassin Thomas Crooks as 'ready to die for freedom and democracy.' Crooks tried to assassinate Trump during a July rally in Butler, Pa., striking Trump in the left ear, killing one attendee, and injuring two others before being fatally shot by the Secret Service. Routh sent a similar letter to the Palm Beach Post before the election that also referred to Trump as a 'dictator.' 'Palm Beach should be leading the way and guiding our country hopefully to choose democracy over a dictator,' that letter reads.

Ethiopian Israelis celebrate Sigd with prayers for unity and heal...	Sigd comes from the Aramaic word sged which means to prostrate oneself, as in prayer. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Ethiopian community gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the holiday of Sigd with a prayer gathering at the Western Wall and other events around the capital. Celebrated in Ethiopia for centuries, the holiday symbolizes the community’s longing for Jerusalem and connection to their Jewish heritage. It is now recognized as an official holiday in Israel and takes place 50 days after Yom Kippur. 'The prayer today at the Western Wall was a special and more meaningful prayer because it also dealt with the needs of the hour for the success of the Israeli government, the security forces, the return of the abductees and the physical and mental healing of the wounded,' said Deputy Speaker of the Knesset MK Moshe Solomon, who was born in in Ethiopia’s Tigray region. The holiday is marked with prayers, fasting, and public readings of the Torah on mountaintops, signifying the community’s aspirations to return to Zion. Since their mass immigration to Israel, Ethiopian Jews have continued this practice, often gathering in Jerusalem to mark the day. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Israel’s Ethiopian community stands at 171,600, of whom 54% were born in Ethiopia as of 2023. This includes 1,812 Ethiopian Jews who immigrated that year. Higher education enrollment is steadily increasing, with 4,144 Ethiopian students attending universities and colleges in the 2023/24 academic year, a 29.7% rise since 2016. This progress outpaces the general student population’s growth in higher education during the same period. Sigd comes from the Aramaic word sged which means to prostrate oneself, as in prayer.

Hezbollah believed to have lost as many as 4,000 fighters	According to World Bank estimates, Lebanon suffered $8.5 billion in damages and economic losses during the war—$3.4 billion in physical infrastructure damage and $5.1 billion in economic losses. By Joshua Marks, JNS In the past 14 months, the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah is believed to have suffered as many as 10 times the casualties as it did during the month-long 2006 Second Lebanon War. According to an assessment by Israel’s Channel 12 News and Institute for National Security Studies, the Israeli military believes that approximately 3,000 terrorists were killed in Lebanon, including at least 11 brigade-level commanders, 37 battalion commanders and 46 company commanders. Lebanon’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants, reports 3,823 killed and 15,895 injured during the conflict. A source familiar with Hezbollah’s operations told Reuters on Thursday that as many as 4,000 terrorists may have been killed, the vast majority of them since September, when Jerusalem stepped up its offensive in Lebanon after adding the return of tens of thousands of displaced residents to their homes in the north to its official war goals. The figure is over 10 times the number of Hezbollah members killed during the 2006 war. Hezbollah’s chain of command was also decimated, as highlighted by the Sept. 27 assassination of Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Other high-ranking officials killed include Hashem Safi al-Din, Nasrallah’s successor; Radwan Force commanders Ibrahim Aqil and Wisam al-Tuwail; Ali Karaki, commander of the Southern Front; and Fuad Shukr, the terror group’s chief of staff. Furthermore, some 80% of Hezbollah’s stockpile of 150,000 to 200,000 rockets and 70% of its drone arsenal were destroyed during the war, according to the Channel 12/INSS assessment. Hezbollah launched some 16,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel since joining the war in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the Gaza-based terror organization’s massacre in southern Israel. Nearly 70,000 residents of northern Israel have been internally displaced due to the cross-border attacks from Lebanon. During 'Operation Northern Arrows,' the Israeli military’s name for the northern war, 45 Israeli civilians and 79 IDF soldiers were killed, according to the most recent data from the Alma Research and Education Center, which monitors the northern fronts. Israeli authorities estimate property damage to exceed $273 million, according to Reuters, while Channel 12 and INSS reported that according to World Bank estimates, Lebanon suffered $8.5 billion in damages and economic losses during the war—$3.4 billion in physical infrastructure damage and $5.1 billion economic losses. An analysis of satellite data by The Washington Post in early November revealed that nearly a quarter of all buildings in 25 Lebanese towns and villages near the Israeli border were damaged or destroyed. At least 5,868 buildings were affected, with almost half located in the heavily impacted areas of Aita al-Shaab and Kafr Kila. Approximately 80% of the damage occurred after Oct. 2, 2024, coinciding with Israel’s ground offensive. The war displaced 1.2 million people in Lebanon, primarily from Southern Lebanon and the Dahieh district south of Beirut. Many sought refuge in Christian strongholds like Beirut and Mount Lebanon.

Israeli wheelchair dancing duo wins first place in European champ...	A Ness Ziona native, Margalit, 29, has been in a wheelchair since the age of 14 after suffering from the disease transverse myelitis. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Israeli wheelchair dancer Tomer Margalit and her dance partner Orel Chalaf won first place at the Para Dance Sport European Championship held in Prague on Friday with a combination freestyle routine that was set to Eden Golan‘s Eurovision song 'October Rain.' The dancing duo also dedicated their routine to the hostages still held captive by Hamas terrorists since being abducted on Oct. 7, 2023, during their deadly rampage across southern Israel. The dancers performed parts of their routine while blindfolded and tried to resemble the victims of the Oct. 7 attack by wearing garments that were torn, dirty, or appeared to be blood-stained. A Ness Ziona native, Margalit, 29, has been in a wheelchair since the age of 14 after suffering from the disease transverse myelitis. Chalaf, 21, is a professional Latin dancer, according to Ynet. The two dancers said that many of their competitors in the Para Dance Sport European Championship, as well as others involved in the competition, asked them to explain their dance, costumes and the significance of the song, according to the Israel Paralympic Committee. They welcomed the opportunity to draw awareness to the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre, including the remaining hostages. Margalit and Chalaf said they hope that by the next Para Dance World Championship, the hostages will be back home and there will be no longer a need to call for their return. 'October Rain' has lyrics that directly reference the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack in Israel. The song was initially written for Golan to perform at this year’s Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden. However, it was rejected by the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the contest, for being too political. Golan instead competed in the Eurovision with a reworded version of the song, titled 'Hurricane,' and finished in fifth place in the international competition. The 2024 Para Dance Sport European Championship took place from Nov. 22-24. Margalit shared in an Instagram post that she won first place a total of three times in the competition this year, including in solo dances.

EU warns member states against ‘undermining’ ICC arrest warrants,...	EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell defends International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister and ex-defense minister, warns EU member states not to ignore or 'undermine' the decision by refusing to arrest Netanyahu. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff The 27 member states of the European Union must strictly adhere to last week's decision by the International Criminal Court at The Hague to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the EU's top diplomat said Thursday. Speaking with reporters in Brussels on Thursday, Josep Borrell, the outgoing High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, warned European leaders not to ignore or 'undermine' the ICC arrest warrants, and defended the court's decision last Thursday to arrest the senior Israeli leaders. 'We cannot undermine the International Criminal Court,' Borrell said. 'It is the only way of having global justice. It is the only way to implement accountability.' 'If the Europeans do not support fully the International Court, without procrastination, then the International Criminal Court will not work.' The court's decision against Netanyahu and Gallant, Borrell argued, was 'not political.' The court 'is a legal body formed by respected people who are the best among the profession of judges.' Borrell rejected accusations of antisemitism in the decision against the Israeli leaders, citing the involvement of some Holocaust survivors in advising the ICC. 'Survivors of the Shoah has been among the people who were advising the International Criminal Court. So, the accusation of antisemitism is once again a failure word.' Speaking just days before the end of his term as the EU's foreign affairs chief, Borrell made scathing criticisms not only of Israel's handling of the war against Hamas, but also Israeli society as a whole, claiming extremist elements have created a 'different Israel.' 'Israeli society is being colonised from the inside by extremism and violent people. The colonists are not only expanding on the Israeli territory. The colonisation of the mind of the people is the most dangerous thing that Israeli society is facing because it is undermining the foundations of their democracy.'

IDF carries out drone strike, opens fire on terrorists after Leba...	Suspects approach IDF positions in southern Lebanon, violating ceasefire for the third time in 24 hours, prompting Israeli soldiers to open fire. By World Israel News Staff Israeli soldiers deployed to southern Lebanon opened fire Thursday on suspects who approached villages in the area under IDF control, the Israeli military announced. The movement by the suspected terrorists, including some approaching in vehicles, towards Israeli positions marked yet another breach of the ceasefire which went into effect at 4:00 a.m. Wednesday morning. Hezbollah terrorists violated the ceasefire at least twice on Wednesday, including an incident at 9:07 a.m. during which operatives from the Iran-backed group approached an IDF position in Kfarkela, opposite the Israeli town of Metulla. At 12:08 p.m. that day, Hezbollah terrorists were spotted approaching the Israel-Lebanon border, prompting IDF soldiers to open fire. Israeli forces carried out a drone strike near a vehicle Thursday morning in the southern Lebanese town of Markaba, Galei Tzahal reported Thursday, leaving three injured. According to two Lebanese security officials who spoke with Reuters, Israeli tanks also fired several rounds at a terrorist position in Markaba. One of the two officials claimed that two people were injured by the tank fire, claim Lebanese state media appeared to corroborate. The pro-Hezbollah Al Mayadeen newspaper accused Israel of violating the ceasefire in Markaba. Under the terms of the ceasefire, which was adopted Tuesday by the Israeli security cabinet, Israel and Lebanon both retain the right to self-defense. A letter given to the Israeli government by the Biden administration recognizes Israel's right to act against terrorist threats in southern Lebanon without limit, while the IDF must defer to the Lebanese military outside of southern Lebanon and is only allowed to take action if the Lebanese army is shown to be unwilling or unable to remove the threat.

‘Colossal Failure’ – Mayor of northern Israeli town says Lebanon ...	Margaliot’s Eitan Davidi said that there was no victory in Lebanon because Israel’s residents will not be safe and they should not return home. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The head of a moshav along the border with Lebanon slammed the ceasefire deal with the Hezbollah terror group that went into effect Wednesday, in an interview Thursday with Radio 103FM. Eitan Davidi pulled no punches when noting the deal’s main weakness. 'We repeatedly requested that the distance between us and the villages where Hezbollah terrorists live in Lebanon be extended to two or three kilometers. Everyone, including the military, told us this proximity couldn’t continue.' It is 'a colossal failure' that the government 'didn’t deliver' on a buffer zone, he said, charging that this will 'lead us to a fourth Lebanon war and to the disintegration of the northern communities.' There is no exclusionary strip included in the agreement, but Israel has unofficially reserved the right – backed by the U.S. – to destroy any Hezbollah effort to reinstate its men or weaponry in southern Lebanon after the IDF pullout in 60 days’ time. An Israeli official told Reuters Wednesday that the IDF has leveled enough of Hezbollah’s infrastructure near the border that any attempt to re-enter the area would be seen and there would be enough time for Israel to respond. However, there is no clause in the deal stating that the Lebanese villages cannot be rebuilt, which would provide new hiding places for weapons and missile launchers, and the men to operate them. In its two-and-a-half month foray into Lebanon, IDF forces found that Iran’s chief proxy had built up a formidable armory in every village they entered and a tunnel network that reached the Israeli border in several places. Davidi does not believe that the government would follow through on its threats, due to past experience. 'I don’t trust the prime minister in anything he does—everything he touches fails,' he said. Although all top officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yisrael Katz, have warned that Israel will respond forcefully to every Hezbollah violation, he noted that 'for 18 years — 14 of them under Netanyahu — we bought time at an exorbitant cost' instead of acting against the terrorists. The government is 'ruining everything' in its failure to 'crush' Hezbollah 'more effectively,' and has given the terrorist group 'a second chance,' he said. None of the nearly 70,000 residents who were evacuated from Israel’s north last October for their own safety should return home, he said. 'Don’t go back,' he said. 'They’re sending us like sheep to the slaughter. Be careful. If the Radwan Force enters the North, the lucky ones will be killed outright.' The government has acknowledged that many residents will not be able to return for months yet, because their homes have been partially or completely destroyed due to Hezbollah’s rocket fire and need to be rebuilt, but said that people can return to other communities that are intact, or where the damage is much more limited.

Egyptian negotiators head to Israel with plans for limited Gaza c...	Egyptian delegation set to arrive in Israel Thursday, and will reportedly present proposal for a scaled-down hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire plan, lasting two months. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Egyptian government is slated to dispatch a delegation of intelligence officials to Israel Thursday, for consultations with Israel's negotiating team regarding efforts to reboot stalled hostage deal talks. During the meetings with their Israeli counterparts Thursday, the Egyptian delegation is expected to present an alternate plan, dubbed a 'comprehensive vision' for an agreement, according to sources who spoke with the pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar outlet. The alternate negotiating track would pursue a scaled-down deal initially, with a limited number of hostages to be released during a two-month ceasefire. Unlike the previous formula for talks, the new plan would not mandate a permanent end to the war, nor a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Israel would, during the initial ceasefire, be able to retain its positions in the coastal enclave, though it would be prohibited from undertaking any combat operations. A number of Israeli hostages would be released gradually over the course of the two-month ceasefire, with elderly and ill hostages being released first. 'There is optimism regarding reaching an agreement soon, due to American support,' Egyptian intelligence officials were quoted as saying. However, an Israeli source denied the report regarding the Egyptian delegation's impending arrival, telling Yedioth Aharanoth 'There is no such thing.' Thursday's report in Al-Akhbar adds that under the Egyptian plan, talks would be held during the two-month ceasefire for a permanent end to the war. Once the initial ceasefire goes into effect, Egypt will give Hamas several days to draft and hand over a comprehensive list of all living Israelis still held captive in the Gaza Strip. There are 101 captives remaining in the coastal enclave, though Israeli intelligence estimates that roughly half are likely dead.

China releases 3 Americans in prisoner exchange with Washington	The Biden administration traded the three American citizens for at least one unidentified Chinese citizen in U.S. custody. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon China released three Americans on Wednesday in a prisoner swap between Washington and Beijing, Politico reported. 'We are pleased to announce the release of Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and John Leung from detention in the People's Republic of China,' a National Security Council spokesman told Axios in a statement. The release of Swidan, Li, and Leung comes after years of comprehensive discussions between Biden administration officials and their Chinese counterparts.

Floyd Mayweather tells wounded Israeli soldiers at NYC Gala: ‘I’m...	The Belev Echad gala on Monday night raised $4.7 million for wounded IDF soldiers and it included a $100,000 donation from Mayweather. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Undefeated boxing champion Floyd Mayweather was the guest of honor on Monday night at an annual fundraising gala in New York City for wounded soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces. Mayweather accepted the 'Gloves of Healing' award at the gala for Belev Echad, an international initiative that helps wounded IDF veterans. During his acceptance speech on stage, the retired boxer talked about his unwavering support for the Jewish state since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. 'When I stood behind Israel, I wasn’t looking for an award — I felt I did what was right,' he explained. 'And when you choose your side, you stay on that side. And this is the side that I chose … and I will continue to stand behind this side right here.' Mayweather — who retired from professional boxing in 2017 with an undefeated record of 50 wins and no losses – has visited Israel several times since the deadly Hamas-led terrorist attack that took place across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. During his most recent trip to the country in October of this year, he visited wounded IDF soldiers, including some at the Belev Echad rehabilitation center in Kiryat Ono. 'I take my hat off to the soldiers,' Mayweather said on Monday night. 'Those warriors in Israel — I’m behind you guys, 100 percent. Since the war has started, I’ve been to Israel four, five times. And I will be back … It’s all about peace. I’m all about peace, love and happiness.' 'And I truly want the soldiers to continue to hold your heads up high, continue to smile, and continue to love another one,' he added. 'Because life is short and all we have is our loved ones. And that’s why love and your family is priceless … Let’s continue to fight and stand behind one another.' The Belev Echad gala on Monday night raised $4.7 million for wounded IDF soldiers and it included a $100,000 donation from Mayweather, according to Ynet. The legendary former boxer was one of the first outside of Israel to send supplies to the Jewish state after the Oct. 7 massacre last year. He used his private jet to deliver medical equipment, food, bulletproof vests for IDF soldiers, and other supplies needed in Israel. During his recent visit to Israel last month, Mayweather also met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who he described as 'an unbelievable gentleman' on Monday night. In early October, Mayweather pledged $100,000 to United Hatzalah of Israel to help the emergency medical service organization purchase 100 bulletproof vests to keep its volunteers safe.

AI-powered tool GluFormer offers early warning and tailored care ...	The model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 non-diabetic participants, ensuring it captures diverse patterns and generalizes well to different populations. By Pesach Benson, TPS A groundbreaking AI model developed in Israel is offering hope to millions of people managing diabetes or monitoring blood sugar levels by predicting glucose responses to foods, identifying early diabetes risks, and enabling tailored treatments. Developed by researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Tel Aviv-based startup Pheno.AI, and the US-based NVIDIA, the tool called GluFormer uses artificial intelligence to predict glucose levels and other health metrics based on past monitoring data, providing personalized insights into health management. Diabetes currently affects approximately 10% of adults worldwide, with numbers projected to double by 2050 to over 1.3 billion people. The disease is a leading cause of death globally and can result in severe complications such as kidney damage, vision loss, and heart problems. The economic burden of diabetes is expected to reach $2.5 trillion globally by 2030. GluFormer builds on the data from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), wearable devices that track blood sugar levels in real-time. CGM data has already been instrumental in diagnosing prediabetes and diabetes earlier, but GluFormer elevates this potential by forecasting health outcomes up to four years in advance, helping clinicians and patients detect irregularities and plan preventative care strategies. By incorporating dietary intake data, the AI tool can also predict how specific foods or diet changes will impact an individual’s glucose levels. This feature opens doors for precision nutrition, enabling users to make informed dietary choices tailored to their unique metabolic responses. 'Medical data, especially from CGMs, can be viewed as sequences of diagnostic tests that map biological processes over time,' explained Gal Chechik, senior director of AI research at NVIDIA. 'The transformer architecture, originally developed for analyzing long text sequences, can also predict the trajectory of medical diagnostics, revealing valuable insights into a patient’s health.' The novel technology behind GluFormer lies in its use of transformer model architecture, a cutting-edge neural network design originally developed for processing sequential data, such as text, in models like OpenAI’s GPT. This marks a significant leap in its application to healthcare, specifically for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and broader medical diagnostics. GluFormer was trained using CGM data collected every 15 minutes over 14 days. This granular, real-time data enhances the model’s ability to detect subtle trends and irregularities, making it more effective than conventional diagnostic tools. By incorporating dietary data into its analysis, the model can predict individual responses to specific foods, enabling tailored health advice. The model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 non-diabetic participants, ensuring it captures diverse patterns and generalizes well to different populations. The researchers also validated the model on 15 other datasets, demonstrating its ability to predict outcomes for people with various conditions, such as prediabetes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, obesity and gestational diabetes. In addition to glucose levels, GluFormer can forecast various other medical metrics. These include the apnea-hypopnea index, which is a measure of sleep apnea and is associated with type 2 diabetes. It can also forecast systolic blood pressure, which is linked to diabetes risk, and visceral adipose tissue (a marker for fat around organs). 'The convergence of generative AI technology and large-scale health data collection enabled us to extract valuable medical insights. It’s a significant step forward in leveraging AI for healthcare,' said lead researcher Guy Lutsker, a Nvidia researcher and Ph.D. student at the Weizmann Institute. Predicting individual glucose responses to specific foods will allow patients to make informed dietary choices to prevent spikes or crashes in blood sugar levels. For those at high risk of developing diabetes, the model can help identify early warning signs, enabling timely lifestyle adjustments or medical interventions. GluFormer also opens the door to tailored treatment plans and allow doctors to track how medical interventions impact a patient’s glucose levels over time.

Despite ceasefire, schools in northern Israel to remain shuttered	Keeping schools closed is a 'step of necessary caution,' says Defense Minister. By World Israel News Staff Schools in northern Israel are not scheduled to reopen in the near future, despite the recent implementation of a 60 day ceasefire between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group. Educational institutions near the Lebanese border have been shuttered for more than a year, as near-daily missile, rocket, and explosive drone attacks saw dozens of communities evacuated. But even as some displaced residents of the north return to their homes, local schools will not be open, and families with school-age children will need to find alternative educational solutions. As the war between Israel and Hezbollah escalated in late September, Israel's Home Front Command shuttered schools in the Golan Heights - where no communities were evacuated. In a statement, Defense Minister Israel Katz said schools in the Upper Galilee, along the northern border, and in the Golan Heights will not 'return to normalcy.' Referring to the decision as a 'step of necessary caution,' Katz said that keeping schools closed 'sends a clear message regarding Israel’s determination to enforce the [ceasefire] agreement.' Katz reiterated that if 'Hezbollah’s attempts to violate the agreement continue and the Lebanese government does not fulfill its obligations, Israel is prepared to respond strongly.' Katz added that 'we will not give up and we will not compromise on the safety of the residents of the north.' Notably, Katz's decision came after IDF and Home Front Command officials recommended that schools be reopened. Some parents were upset by the decision, after IDF officials gave them the impression that reopening schools was a certainty. 'We share your frustration regarding the change of policy, especially at the last minute. The defense establishment places our safety and the safety of our children as its top priority, and we are sure that such a difficult decision has justified considerations even if they are not visible to us,' said the Southern Golan Regional Council in a statement to parents.

‘Let’s get the hostages’ – Biden presses Netanyahu to cut deal wi...	After securing ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, President Biden reportedly pushes Netanyahu to reach an agreement with Hamas for hostages' release and Gaza truce. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week to compromise with the Hamas terror organization in order to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, Axios reported Wednesday. According to the report, Biden called Netanyahu on Tuesday, after American brokers managed to secure a truce between Israel, Lebanon, and Hezbollah that day, which went into effect Wednesday morning. The report cited two American officials, who said the call came shortly after the Israeli security cabinet voted to approve the ceasefire deal with Hezbollah. The two sources said the call was brief, lasting only a few minutes, and that the call focused on the Lebanon ceasefire, and Biden's push to use the momentum from the deal to secure a similar agreement between Israel and Hamas. 'We have an opportunity now. Let's get the hostages,' Biden was quoted as telling Netanyahu during the call. The report claimed that Netanyahu responded 'positively' and said he wanted to try to secure a deal. One Biden aide said the president is intent on securing a hostage deal before he leaves office in January. 'Biden thinks that doing nothing and telling the hostage families to wait until Jan. 20 would be crazy,' the aide said. Israeli and U.S. officials cited in the report said the Lebanon ceasefire makes a deal with Hamas more likely, even if only the first phase of a planned three-phase deal is actually implemented. According to a senior Israeli minister, the Israeli premier is pushing for a scaled-down hostage deal, under which Israel would not commit to a permanent end to the war or a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. 'There is an intention to make a renewed effort to get a deal in Gaza. It was clear that the war in Lebanon had to end first. Now Hamas is in a weaker position because Hezbollah is out of the war,' the minister told Axios.

12-year-old discovers 3,500-year-old relic in central Israel	12-year-old girl finds ancient Egyptian amulet during a family trip in central Israel. By World Israel News Staff Dafna Filshteiner, age 12, was recently hiking below the ancient site of Tel Qana in Hod Hasharon, when suddenly, to her surprise, she discovered an unusual find a beetle-like stone used as an Egyptian amulet about 3,500 years ago. 'I was looking down at the ground to find porcupine needles and smooth pebbles,' Filshteiner said. 'And suddenly I picked up an interesting stone. I showed it to my mother, and she said it was just an ordinary stone or a bead. But then I saw a decoration and stubbornly insisted it was more than that, so we searched on the Internet.' 'There, we identified more photos of stones similar to what we had found. We realized that it was something special and immediately called the Antiquities Authority.' The family turned to Mor Wiesel, an archaeologist at the Israel Antiquities Authority, who thanked Dafna and her family, awarded them a certificate of excellence for good citizenship, and transferred the scarab to the state archives housed in the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel. The find was examined by Dr. Yitzhak Paz, Bronze Age expert at the Israel Antiquities Authority. The item was found to date back to the New Kingdom period in Egypt, about 3,500 years ago. Two scorpions appear on it, standing head to tail. 'The scorpion symbol represented the Egyptian goddess Serket, who was considered responsible, among other things, for protecting pregnant mothers,' Dr. Paz said. 'Another decoration on the amulet is the nefer symbol, which in Egyptian means ‘good’ or ‘chosen’. There is also another symbol which looks like a royal staff.' The scarab is an amulet designed in the shape of a dung beetle. This beetle, considered sacred in the eyes of the ancient Egyptians, was a symbol of new life, because it would create a dung ball, lay its eggs in it, from which new life then hatched. The Egyptian name derives from the verb 'to form,' or 'to be created', as the Egyptians saw the scarab as symbolizing the embodiment of the divine creator. The scarab amulets found in Israel––sometimes used as a seal––are evidence of Egyptian rule in our region about 3,500 years ago, and its cultural influence on this region. 'The scarab is indeed a distinct Egyptian characteristic, but their wide distribution also reached far beyond Egypt’s borders,' Paz added. 'It may have been dropped by an important and authoritative figure passing through the area, or it may have been deliberately buried. Since the find was discovered on the surface, it is difficult to know its exact context.' Tel Qana, which stands near the findspot of the scarab, is an archaeological site of great historical importance. 'This find is both exciting and significant,' said Dr. Amit Dagan of Bar-Ilan University and Dr. Ayelet Dayan from the Israel Antiquities Authority, who are conducting excavations at the site. 'The scarab and its unique pictorial features, along with other finds discovered at Tel Qana with similar motifs, provide new insights into the nature of the Egyptian influence in the region in general, and the Yarkon area in particular.'

Israel to appeal ‘illegitimate, absurd’ ICC warrants	Biased' ICC warrants lack 'any factual or legal basis,' Jerusalem says in statement. By World Israel News Staff Israel will formally appeal the ICC warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, adding that Jerusalem will partner with Washington to take punitive measures against the Hague. 'The State of Israel rejects the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, and the legitimacy of the arrest warrants that were issued,' read a statement from the Prime Minister's Office. 'Israel’s appeal notice exposes in detail just how absurd the issuance of arrest warrants was and how it lacks any factual or legal basis.' Addressing the charges levied against Netanyahu and Gallant, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, the statement denied those allegations and stressed that Israel is not a member state of the ICC. The statement warned that should the ICC move forward with the warrants, such a move would 'underline to Israel’s friends in the U.S. and the world how biased the International Criminal Court is against Israel.' Netanyahu's office added that the premier is contact with senior Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Israel supporter. Graham, Netanyahu's office said, had updated the prime minister regarding 'the efforts that he is advancing in the US Congress against the ICC and countries that have co-operated with it'. Last week, President Joe Biden called the ICC warrants 'outrageous.' Noting that an arrest warrant was also issued against slain Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, Biden added that 'whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.' When the ICC decision was made public last week, Netanyahu called the warrants 'an antisemitic step that has one goal - to deter me, to deter us from having our natural right to defend ourselves against enemies who try to destroy us.' American attorney Alan Dershowitz recently said he is assembling a 'legal dream team' to defend Israel in the Hague.

IDF thwarted Hezbollah’s efforts to produce chemical weapons – re...	The source said that Hezbollah's Radwan force were planning to use the weapons against civilians in Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An unsourced report on Channel 12 indicates the IDF thwarted an attempt by Hezbollah to produce chemical weapons they intended to use in an invasion of northern Israel. The report did not indicate precisely where the weapons were found. The source said that Hezbollah's Radwan force were planning to use the weapons against civilians in Israel. Hezbollah was reportedly at the early stages of the development of chemical weapons, and Israel's intelligence and military are monitoring the threat. An earlier report by Makor Rishon said Israeli troops discovered gas tanks, coveralls, and gas masks. The report is derived from interviews with Israeli soldiers, although the IDF has denied the report. In the first 12 hours of the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon, Hezbollah has already violated the agreement twice with a swift response from the IDF. From the implementation of the truce, which was set to begin at 4:00 am on Wednesday morning, Hezbollah twice approached areas that were barred from them according to the agreement. The ceasefire proposal requires Hezbollah to retreat to the area behind the Litani River. The first violation occurred at 9:07 am when Hezbollah terrorists approached Kfarkela, which overlooks Metula. David Azoulay, the leader of the Metula Council, addressed the ceasefire violation, stating, 'Just a few minutes ago, eight vehicles and a motorcycle belonging to Hezbollah arrived at the ruins in Kfarkela. The IDF fired a warning shot to push them back. Nothing has changed since October 7.' The IDF confirmed: 'By the directive from the political echelon, the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon took effect at 04:00 today (Wednesday), and the IDF has been acting accordingly.' 'Over the past hour, the IDF detected a vehicle with several suspects in a restricted zone in Lebanese territory. IDF troops fired to prevent their movement, and the suspects subsequently left the area.' 'There have been no changes to the guidelines issued by the Home Front Command.' The second violation of the ceasefire took place at 12:08 when the IDF fired warning shots when Hezbollah suspects approached the Western section of the Israel-Lebanon border. The IDF confirmed: 'In the past few hours, the IDF detected suspects in southern Lebanon and fired at them.'

Adolf Eichmann’s executioner dies at 86	He was also present when Eichmann’s body was cremated in a specially built oven. By Pesach Benson, TPS Shalom Nagar, a former Prison Services officer who hung Adolf Eichmann, died at the age of 86. Born in Yemen, he was orphaned of his father and abandoned by his mother. Nagar he made his way to Israel at the age of 14. After completing his military service as a paratrooper, Nagar joined the prison service. Adolf Eichmann, the chief architect of the Nazi Germany’s Final Solution, was captured in Buenos Aires by the Mossad and spirited back to Israel for trial in 1960. Because most of the Prison Service guards were either concentration camp survivors or had lost family in the Holocaust, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion specifically ordered that Eichmann be guarded by Sephardic Jews — who trace their ancestry to the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain. Nagar and 21 other handpicked guards stayed with Eichmann for six months at the Ramla Prison in central Israel. They watched Eichmann in shifts to prevent him from committing suicide and tasted his food in case it was poisoned. Following an eight-month trial in Jerusalem, Eichmann was convicted of crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes against the Jewish people, and membership in a criminal organization and sentenced to death by hanging. He was hung in the Ramla prison at midnight on May 31, 1962, the only individual ever executed by Israel. Nagar lottery selected to push the button that opened the trapdoor below the Eichmann’s gallows. He was also present when Eichmann’s body was cremated in a specially built oven. A Coast Guard boat scattered Eichmann’s ashes in the sea several kilometers off the coast of Jaffa. After retiring from the Prison Service, Nagar worked as a butcher and later was one of the founding families of Kiryat Arba, next to Hebron. Nagar adopted a religious lifestyle and spent his later years in a kollel, studying Torah and receiving a stipend. Nagar is survived by his children, 12 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

Iran treats Hezbollah terrorists while own citizens die in hospit...	The lavish medical support for Hezbollah terrorists has ignited fury among Iranian citizens, who face a deepening healthcare crisis marked by severe medicine shortages and an exodus of medical professionals. By Jewish Breaking News While Iranian civilians struggle to access basic healthcare, Tehran’s hospitals have become a haven for thousands of wounded Hezbollah terrorists. Iranian Health Minister Mohammadreza Zafarghandi revealed to student Basij leaders on Tuesday that nearly 500 Hezbollah terrorists received specialized treatment in Iranian facilities, requiring approximately 1,500 surgeries for devastating injuries sustained during Israel’s September strike on the terror group’s communication systems. According to Red Crescent chief Pirhossein Kolivand, Tehran deployed specialized medical teams to Lebanon, including eye specialists, while arranging hospital transfers for 95 severely wounded Hezbollah terrorists. A medical task force of 12 doctors plus support staff provided additional ground support. The lavish medical support for Hezbollah terrorists has ignited fury among Iranian citizens, who face a deepening healthcare crisis marked by severe medicine shortages and an exodus of medical professionals seeking better opportunities abroad. Human rights advocates point to the regime’s cruel double standard, noting its refusal to provide care to Iranian protesters who were deliberately blinded during the country’s 2022 civil unrest crackdown. In a recent Knesset speech, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disclosed that Israel moved up its preplanned targeted attack against Hezbollah, which blinded and injured thousands of Hezbollah operatives, due to fears of exposure. 'From the moment I learned that this was about to be revealed, I decided that it was necessary to act immediately,' Netanyahu said. 'There were those who argued that the US should be informed ahead of time. I argued that the US should not be informed because this could lead to either resistance or a leak, which is the same thing,' he stated. 'A leak would have immediately demonstrated the effectiveness of the move. I denied it outright and we acted.'

‘He’s not kidding’: Trump border czar Tom Homan prepares for depo...	Democrats, those close to Homan said, need to weigh whether any political stunts are worth the severe criminal penalties. By Joseph Simonson, The Washington Free Beacon As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to fulfill his pledge to carry out the mass illegal immigrant deportations he promised, all eyes are on the man tasked with implementing that mission: incoming 'border czar' Thomas Homan, a more than 30-year law enforcement veteran who led Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the first Trump administration. Standing in Homan's way are a handful of Democratic governors and mayors who have vowed to fight deportations of illegal immigrants in their jurisdictions. The most notable case is Denver mayor Mike Johnston (D.), who said last week in an interview that he is willing to put police officers at the county line to repel ICE agents, comparing Trump’s immigration plans to the massacre at Tiananmen Square. 'More than us having DPD stationed at the county line to keep them out, you would have 50,000 Denverites there,' Johnston told Denverite. 'It's like the Tiananmen Square moment with the rose and the gun, right? You’d have every one of those Highland moms who came out for the migrants. And you do not want to mess with them.' While Johnston walked back those comments, he still said he's ready to go to jail for obstructing Trump's immigration actions he thinks are 'wrong.' 'Would I have taken it back if I could? Yes, I probably wouldn't have used that image,' Johnston told 9News. 'That's the image I hope we can avoid. What I was trying to say is this is an outcome I hope we can avoid in this country.' Johnston is one of many Democrats who have pledged to make it difficult for Trump and Homan to carry out mass deportations. Those close to Homan told the Washington Free Beacon that the Trump White House is prepared to use all tools at its disposal to force them to cooperate with—or at least not obstruct—its mass deportation agenda. Those tools include prosecutions under at least two provisions in the federal code. Federal law prohibits an individual from knowingly harboring any illegal aliens from law enforcement. It's also a felony to hinder any law enforcement investigation—a charge Homan is likely to call for should any local or state leader attempt to slow down deportations. Democrats, those close to Homan said, need to weigh whether any political stunts are worth the severe criminal penalties. Homan, who did not respond to a request for comment, said as much on Monday. In an interview with Fox News, he said, 'Me and the Denver mayor agree on one thing: He is willing to go to jail, and I am willing to put him there.' There is no doubt among those who worked with Homan that he intends to make good on his threat. One individual, who spoke anonymously but worked with Homan directly, said the next Trump administration is expected to work with the Justice Department and bring felony charges against those who actively block any ICE deportations. 'Homan talks about this almost every day,' said one individual who spoke on the condition of anonymity but worked closely under Homan during the first administration. 'He’s not kidding.' Blue states and cities, by law, do not have to cooperate with federal law enforcement. A local police department is not legally required to assist ICE or any other federal agency with deportations. But state and local officials cannot, for example, order police officers to block an ICE official from entering a building, as Johnston suggested earlier this month. Nor can they give false information to a federal law enforcement official. Denver’s mayor is not the only Democrat who has said he will fight Trump’s planned deportations. Six Democratic prosecutors spoke with Politico earlier this month and said they plan a rash of lawsuits. That may make some deportations more difficult. Homan is more than happy to face that problem, though those close to him believe that some police departments located in so-called sanctuary cities, municipalities with policies that block local law enforcement from cooperating with federal deportation orders, will relent. Trump’s attorney general nominee, Pam Bondi, is expected to work closely with Homan and others to force Democratic compliance. One factor that attracted Bondi to Trump, an individual familiar with the choice told the Free Beacon, was her hardline position against drug traffickers as Florida’s attorney general. The incoming Trump administration is itching for a fight with Democrats on deportations, said one individual familiar with their thinking. Polls taken after Trump’s decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris show that a majority of voters support a mass deportation program. 'Sanctuary policies are wildly unpopular, even among blue state voters, and these governors and mayors are siding with lawbreaking foreigners who have overstayed visas, ignored court orders, and committed horrific crimes,' said Jon Feere, who served as a senior adviser to the Department of Homeland Security during Trump’s first term. There are an estimated 12 million illegal aliens living in the United States, according to the Center for Migration Studies of New York, although some believe that figure is much higher. ew immigration experts believe all of those individuals can be deported within four years, regardless of whether Trump mobilizes the military. Homan has said that he plans to prioritize illegal aliens with criminal convictions or those who have already received a deportation order from an immigration court. Such a strategy could, one senior Republican adviser said, shield Trump from any political fallout. 'The first hundred thousand or so will be the easiest,' the individual said. 'Trump can just line them up and say, ‘There’s a rapist, there’s a thief, there’s a murderer.' Democrats don’t want to oppose that.'

IAF destroyed secret Hezbollah rocket factory ahead of ceasefire	The strike disabled Hezbollah’s capacity to produce mid-range rockets in Lebanon, according to the report. By JNS Shortly before the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect early Wednesday morning, Israeli jets dropped about 100 bombs on a top-secret factory for producing mid-range rockets, according to Hebrew media reports. The Israel Defense Forces had been aware of the facility in Janta, a city situated about 75 kilometers (46 miles) east of Beirut, for some time despite Hezbollah’s efforts to camouflage it, Channel 12 News reported on Wednesday. The strike disabled Hezbollah’s capacity to produce mid-range rockets in Lebanon, according to the report. Also on Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson’s Unit said that since the start of hostilities with Hezbollah on Oct 8., 2023, the Iranian proxy group has lost 70% of its unmanned aerial vehicles. 'Since the beginning of the war and within the framework of ‘Operation Northern Arrows’ in particular, fighter jets under the direction of the Intelligence Directorate and the air force launched an extensive effort to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure of Hezbollah’s Aerial Unit,' also known as Unit 127, according to the IDF. Some 200 targets were hit as part of this effort, including more than 150 drone launch sites and some 20 weapons depots and 30 headquarters used by the unit, according to the IDF. Four factories for drones and cruise missiles were also hit. 'With the help of these attacks, Hezbollah lost 70% of its stock of UAVs, and about 30 cruise missiles intended to harm Israeli citizens,' according to the statement. Moreover, the Aerial Unit’s chain of command has been 'eliminated' with the assassination of its operations officer, Jafar Ali Samaha, on Tuesday night in a targeted strike, the military said. The IDF eliminated the commander of Unit 127, Muhammad Hussein Sarour ('Abu Saleh'), in Beirut on Sept. 26. A month later it eliminated Khadr al-Abed Bahja, the officer responsible for the unit’s Northern Litani sector.

Israeli leaders in Judea and Samaria laying groundwork for sovere...	Israeli leaders hope that Trump will revisit the issue of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, aligning with his previous peace plans’ provisions for annexing Area C of Judea and Samaria. By Anna Epshtein, TPS Anticipating support from the incoming US administration of President-elect Donald Trump, leaders of Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria are laying the groundwork for the possible extension of Israeli sovereignty to parts of the territory. Briefing reporters on Wednesday, Israel Ganz, head of the Yesha Council, suggested that after achieving normalization with other Arab countries, discussions on sovereignty in Judea and Samaria could resume. The Yesha Council is an umbrella organization for all the communities in Judea and Samaria, representing the interests of around 500,000 Israelis. 'We anticipate more countries joining the normalization process with Israel,' Ganz said, without naming specific states. Israel and Saudi Arabia were moving closer to normalization before the diplomacy was disrupted by Hamas’s October 7 attack. Ganz expressed hope that Trump would revisit the issue of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, aligning with his previous peace plans’ provisions for annexing Area C of Judea and Samaria. The Oslo Accords divided Judea and Samaria into Areas A, B, and C. In Area A, the Palestinian Authority maintains administrative and security responsibility. In Area B, the Palestinian Authority has administrative jurisdiction, but Israel maintains responsibility for security. In Area C, where all of Judea and Samaria’s Jews live, Israel has administrative and security jurisdiction. Area C makes up 60 percent of the territory of Judea and Samaria. Ganz said he prefers the term 'sovereignty' over 'annexation,' clarifying, 'Annexation focuses on land ownership, while sovereignty is about responsibility.' The Yesha Council has begun preparatory work which Ganz described as mostly conceptual. 'We’re brainstorming, not drawing maps,' Ganz explained. 'Our focus is on technical readiness, such as water and electricity infrastructure, should a political decision be made.' Ganz predicted a potential timeline for action, suggesting that sovereignty measures could take place within 18 months. 'We have elections in Israel in two years and U.S. midterms approaching. This creates a window of opportunity to find a solution,' he said. Regarding the status of Palestinians living in Area C, Ganz said he supported giving them full Israeli citizenship. The number of Palestinians living in Areas C is not clear, but estimates range from 80,000-300,000. As for the status of an estimated more than 2 million Palestinians living in Areas A and B, Ganz proposed a model similar to the status of Palestinians living in eastern Jerusalem. Palestinians living in Jerusalem with temporary residence permits are entitled to vote in municipal elections and receive social benefits, but cannot vote in national elections or hold a mayoral office. Explaining his optimism, Ganz remarked, 'The last US administration was the worst, as for me, because they didn’t want to hear what we say. They never came here, although we tried hard to invite them. How can you come up with any solution when you only hear one side? I hope that the new administration will give us as a democratic state a chance to say what we want.'

Anti-Israel groups plan coordinated protests in ‘global escalatio...	A similar coalition in April coordinated a 'multi-city economic blockade' and for hours stopped traffic on major highways and thruways, including the Golden Gate Bridge. By Jessica Costescu, The Washington Free Beacon A coalition of radical anti-Israel groups is planning a 'global escalation' in dozens of cities across the United States throughout the Thanksgiving holiday season. The 'Global Escalation' coalition describes itself as 'a collective effort from people who share the understanding that we must urgently step up our actions to stop this genocide.' It directs activists to protest in their area and provides resources on how to organize and improve their security strategies. Some of the cities listed include New York, Chicago, Sacramento, Denver, and Charleston. 'We reject a world where genocide and war crimes go unpunished. In 3 days, for 3 days, withdraw from participating in the global economy to reject this new ‘normal,’' the coalition posted Sunday on Instagram. 'Disrupt any and all entities that allow or enable genocide. Disrupt the finances fuelling or profiting from genocide.' 'Join direct action and strikes around the world: refuse labour, stop spending, and hit the pockets of those fuelling or profiting from genocide,' the post continued. In Charleston, S.C., for instance, a participating anti-Israel group is planning to 'start [a] car caravan to interrupt business as usual through the central arteries' of the city. In Chicago, the local chapters of the Palestinian American Council, Students for Justice in Palestine, and American Muslims for Palestine will protest at a large shopping mall to 'reject capitalist ‘holidays.’' The coalition’s website boasts that it 'will bring together people and movements around the world to step up the collective resistance by going on strike, refusing to shop and by taking direct action. It will be the first of a series of blows that will force change.' 'By halting revenue over one of the most profitable times of the year, the people stand in solidarity with all communities harmed by the same colonial forces worldwide, rejecting the celebration of colonial legacies like ‘Thanksgiving Day’ on the 28th,' the site continues. 'The efforts will culminate on the 29th, coinciding with the Friday Day of Rage and the opening of the infamous ‘Black Friday’ season. Most importantly, November 29th marks the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.' Additional protests are also planned in Omaha, Boise, Malden, Mass., Ventura, San Pedro, and Williamstown, Mass. Others are expected in Canada, Australia, Japan, and throughout Europe. A similar coalition in April coordinated a 'multi-city economic blockade' and for hours stopped traffic on major highways and thruways, including the Golden Gate Bridge. Left-wing groups, including the Tides Center—a George Soros-funded dark money network—Community Justice Exchange, and National Students for Justice in Palestine were among the participating groups. In one instance, activists shut down access to Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, backing up traffic and forcing some travelers to walk with their luggage to the airport. Organizers advised activists to refrain from engaging with police and promised that Community Justice Exchange would provide 'money bail, court fees and fines' anThanksd other legal services upon arrest.

Italy rejects Netanyahu arrest as ‘unfeasible’	Rome expresses 'many doubts' about practical relevance of International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, says it is 'not feasible' to take him into custody so long as he remains in office. By World Israel News Staff The Italian government suggested Tuesday that the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is irrelevant, saying it is 'unfeasible' to arrest a sitting head of government. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani spoke at a press conference Tuesday during the Group of Seven (G7) conference hosted by Italy, telling reporters that his government had 'many doubts' regarding the viability of the ICC's arrest warrant for Prime Minister Netanyahu. 'Netanyahu would never go to a country where he can be arrested,' Tajani told reporters Tuesday, suggesting that practically speaking, the arrest warrant against Netanyahu cannot be implemented while he remains in office. 'The arrest of Netanyahu is unfeasible, at least as long as he is Prime Minister.' On Tuesday, the G7 countries, including Italy, the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France, Germany, and Japan, issued a joint statement on the situation in the Middle East, following the publication of the ICC arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. However, efforts to reach a common ground on the ICC arrest warrants failed, and the statement declined to directly address the issue, referencing the subject obliquely, calling on Israel to adhere to 'International Humanitarian Law,' while rejecting equivalency between Israel and Hamas. 'In exercising its right to defend itself, Israel must fully comply with its obligations under international law in all circumstances, including International Humanitarian Law,' the G7 members said. 'We reiterate our commitment to International Humanitarian Law and will comply with our respective obligations. We underline that there can be no equivalence between the terrorist group Hamas and the State of Israel.' The Italian government has also been sharply divided over the ICC arrest warrants, with Defense Minister Guido Crosetto of the conservative Brothers of Italy party indicating Italy would adhere to the ICC's instructions should Netanyahu visit the country; while Infrastructure and Transportation Minister Matteo Salvini of the populist Lega party reject calls to arrest the Israeli premier and instead invited him to visit Italy.

After Lebanon deal, Hamas ‘ready for ceasefire’	Hamas official says that in the wake of the truce between Israel and Hezbollah, and amid efforts by Turkey, Egypt, and Qatar to reboot talks, the terrorist group is 'ready' for a 'serious' deal with Israel. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization is 'ready' to engage in 'serious' talks with Israel aimed at reaching a hostage deal and lasting ceasefire, a member of the group said Wednesday. Speaking with AFP Wednesday morning after a truce went into effect in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, the Hamas official said his organization is now 'committed' to pursuing talks with Israel, brokered by Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar. 'We have informed mediators in Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey that Hamas is ready for a ceasefire agreement and a serious deal to exchange prisoners,' the Hamas spokesman said Wednesday, after a ceasefire negotiated by the U.S. and France went into effect between Israel and Hezbollah, a group which, like Hamas, is considered a proxy force of Iran. In a statement Wednesday morning, Hamas announced it is prepared to engage in 'any effort' necessary to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. 'We are committed to cooperating with any effort to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, and we are interested in ending the aggression against our people.' Later on Wednesday, Hamas' Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that the group 'appreciates' Hezbollah's right to reach an independent agreement with Israel, separate from a broader deal including the Gaza Strip. 'Hamas appreciates the right of Lebanon and Hezbollah to reach an agreement that protects the people of Lebanon and we hope that this agreement will pave the way to reaching an agreement that ends the war of genocide against our people in Gaza.' Abu Zuhri, however, claimed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was an obstacle to any deal. 'Hamas showed high flexibility to reach an agreement and it is still committed to that position and is interested in reaching an agreement that ends the war in Gaza.' 'The problem was always with Netanyahu who has always escaped from reaching an agreement.' While Hamas has blamed Israel for months for the failure to achieve a hostage deal, both Jerusalem and Washington have accused the Gaza terror group of rejecting any compromises in ceasefire talks. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden placed the onus on Hamas to achieve a breakthrough. 'Hamas has refused, for months and months, to negotiate a good-faith ceasefire and a hostage deal,' Biden said. 'And so, now Hamas has a choice to make. Their only way out is to release the hostages, including American citizens which they hold, and, in the process, bring an end to the fighting, which would make possible a surge of humanitarian relief.'

France declares Netanyahu cannot be arrested over ICC warrants	French foreign ministry releases statement emphasizing that it will not carry out the International Criminal Court's orders to arrest Israeli leaders including Prime Minister Netanyahu, noting that he enjoys immunity to ICC rulings. By World Israel News Staff France will not aid the International Criminal Court in The Hague to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the French foreign ministry announced Wednesday morning. In a press release issued by the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Paris noted that Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute which established the ICC, and therefore Israeli leaders are not subject to the court's decisions. While the French foreign ministry said Paris will 'respect' its obligations to the ICC, Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders enjoy immunity vis-a-vis the international court. 'France will respect its international obligations, on the understanding that the Rome Statute requires full cooperation with the International Criminal Court (ICC),' the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs said, 'and also provides that a State cannot be required to act in a manner inconsistent with its obligations under international law with respect to the immunities of States not party to the ICC.' 'Such immunities apply to Prime Minister Netanyahu and other relevant ministers and will need to be taken into consideration should the ICC request their arrest and surrender.' The French foreign ministry noted the 'historic friendship' between Paris and Jerusalem, vowing to work 'closely' with the Israeli premier. 'In accordance with the historic friendship that binds France to Israel, two democracies committed to the rule of law and respect for a professional and independent justice system, France intends to continue to work closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the other Israeli authorities to achieve peace and security for all in the Middle East.'

Israelis sharply divided over ceasefire with Hezbollah	Channel 12's survey showed that 20% even say Israel 'lost' in Lebanon, while a whopping 61% of Channel 13's respondents said Israel 'did not win.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Polls carried out by two Israeli television news channels Tuesday show that the public is sharply divided over the ceasefire deal with Hezbollah that came into effect Wednesday morning. Channel 13’s survey had 37% against the agreement, 44% for it, and nearly a fifth, 19%, answering that they didn’t know. Channel 12’s results were more evenly split, with only 37% thinking it was a good idea, 32% disagreeing, and a much larger minority, 31%, saying they were not sure. In pointed contrast to the top Israeli officials who declared that Israel could declare victory over the Iranian terror proxy that had launched upwards of 20,000 missiles, UAVs, rockets, RPGs and other deadly projectiles at the Jewish state over the past year, fully 61% of the respondents in the Channel 13 poll said Israel 'did not win.' A quarter, 26%, said Israel won, and 13% said they did not know. Channel 12’s group had a very different view, however, with 19% saying Israel 'lost.' The largest group, 50%, believed that the result of the entire military confrontation was inconclusive, while 20% saying the Jewish state lost, and the rest saying they did not know. Channel 12 broke down the respondents into Opposition and coalition supporters, and it revealed a perhaps troubling message to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security cabinet colleagues, all of whom except for National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir voted in favor of the ceasefire. Only one in five government supporters were in favor of the deal, with over double, 45%, saying they were against it. Almost the same percentage, 22%, opined that the bottom line was that Israel had actually lost to the terrorists. The majority of them also disagreed with their politicians’ claims regarding the durability of the agreement, when asked by Channel 12 how much time they thought it would last. A mere 19% said it would last years, with 27% answering 'a few months' and 38% saying it would collapse even faster. Interestingly, the Opposition supporters were not tremendously hopeful either, with 27% saying it would last years, 29% answering 'months' and 26% saying it would tank in only a short time. In light of the shutdown of one front, Channel 13 added a question about the fighting in Gaza against Hamas, asking whether the government should end the war there and pursue a hostage deal. Fully 66% of the respondents said it should be ended, while 27% said the IDF should continue fighting and seven percent answering that they did not know.

Biden administration ‘incredibly concerned’ after Israel ends use...	US State Department expresses dismay after Israeli defense minister ends controversial use of arrest without trial as a preemptive measure against Israeli citizens living in Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration this week expressed dismay after the Israeli government ended the controversial use of emergency powers to detain Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria without trial as a preemptive security measure. Last Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) announced that he had instructed his ministry to halt the practice of using administrative arrest or detention against Israeli citizens living in Judea and Samaria. 'In the current climate, where Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria face significant threats of Palestinian terrorism, supported by the Iranian axis of evil seeking to establish a terror front against Israel, and where international sanctions unfairly target settlers and settlement organizations, it is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such a severe step,' Katz said. Katz emphasized that police and the Shin Bet internal security agency would still be able to use standard law enforcement methods to prevent criminal acts, or to apprehend suspects and bring them to justice. The U.S. State Department, however, expressed grave concerns regarding the change, saying it was one of the few effective 'tools' used by the Israeli government to crack down on 'illegal activity' by 'extremist Israeli settlers.' 'We see the announcement that administrative detentions will no longer be applied to extremist Israeli settlers as a rolling back of one of the limited tools that was effectively being used by the Israeli Government to rein in this illegal activity,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters on Monday. The Biden administration, he continued is 'incredibly concerned about the increasing extremist violence in the West Bank, including assaults on civilians, forced displacement of Palestinian communities, and the willful destruction of homes and farms.' 'We have called on the Government of Israel repeatedly to take further actions to deter extremist settler violence and to hold those engaging in it accountable.' Administrative detentions are a holdover from the British Mandate period, implemented as a emergency regulation beginning in 1945. Following the establishment of Israel in 1948, the policy of holding individuals in prison for up to six months at a time without trial was continued as an emergency measure to combat Arab terrorism and other immediate security threats. While administrative measures have been primarily used against Arab terrorists, they have also been employed at times against Jews - including American citizens.

Iran tracking of thousands of Israelis as potential targets – rep...	Chabad Rabbi Zvi Kogan is believed to have been killed in the UAE after his phone was hacked. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Iran is tracking of thousands of Israelis as potential targets, with several hundred considered at 'high risk' and one already dead, Israel Hayom reported Wednesday. Citing security sources, the paper said that the Iranians have been at it for over a decade, but that in recent years their efforts have skyrocketed due to their ability to hack into phone and personal computers to reveal massive amounts of personal information. This includes home addresses, phone numbers, family details, social networks, places of work and other data that enables the mullahs’ intelligence agencies to know where people are going, when and with whom. The report said that it 'is believed' that the Iranian cell that murdered Chabad Rabbi Zvi Kogan in the UAE several days ago had access to his phone. Most of the Iranian cyber effort is focused on obtaining information on targets inside Israel. Some of them, the report said, have already received direct threats in the form of 'birthday greetings' that say they may not live to see their next birthday. Israeli security has contacted all those considered at high risk, including senior defense officials, to warn them to be on alert as well as avoid traveling abroad. The report said that 'intelligence assessments project Iran will escalate' its efforts against such targets 'imminently,' due to Tehran’s 'mounting losses' in its direct and indirect conflict with Israel over the past year. Iran’s most important proxy, Hezbollah, has had its military and political leadership decimated and most of its rocket threat dissipated by the IDF, forcing it into agreeing Tuesday to a ceasefire that includes a retreat well away from Israel’s northern border. Meanwhile, Hamas has been reduced to mainly guerrilla tactics in the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip as the vast majority of its fighting force has been destroyed. Iran itself has been left without meaningful air defense after the Israeli air force demolished it last month following two unsuccessful attempts to hit the Jewish state with hundreds of missiles. The Islamic Republic has established terror cells in many countries over the years who could be activated against those Tehran considers of value, including Israeli academics and scientists as well as current and former government officials. Several uncovered plots have been widely reported on, in places ranging from Western Europe to Turkey to Thailand, which came to naught thanks in large part to Israeli intelligence personnel working with their counterparts in these countries to arrest the criminals in time. Several spy cells were recently caught in Israel itself, charged with taking pictures of sensitive facilities, carrying out surveillance operations on individuals, and even in a very few cases beginning to actively prepare to attack certain people. The motivation in most cases seems to be money, although those arrested have also included Palestinians from eastern Jerusalem as well as Israeli Jews and Arabs.

Turkey faces congressional heat over Hamas hospitality	The initiative has drawn support from prominent organizations, including the American Jewish Committee, whose managing director of policy Julie Fishman Rayman condemned Turkey’s harboring of terrorists as 'outrageous.' By Jewish Breaking News Turkey has come under intense congressional pressure following reports that the country is providing safe haven to senior Hamas terrorists. In a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Intelligence Director Avril Haines, 39 bipartisan House members are demanding immediate classified briefings about the scope and security implications of Turkey’s deepening relationship with the terrorist organization. 'We are alarmed by recent reports that senior members of Hamas’s leadership have relocated to Turkey with the intent of establishing a headquarters there,' the letter states. 'We have serious concerns about the security implications of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member hosting, and potentially aiding, Hamas, a U.S. and E.U.-designated foreign terrorist organization.' The initiative has drawn support from prominent organizations including the American Jewish Committee, whose managing director of policy Julie Fishman Rayman condemned Turkey’s harboring of terrorists as 'outrageous.' A Turkish diplomatic source speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity rejected reports claiming that Hamas had relocated its political headquarters from Qatar to Turkey, claiming that Hamas members only make periodic visits to the country. On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that he will stand by Arabs with all his 'strength and means' until 'Palestine is fully liberated.' 'What Turkey is doing for Palestine, Gaza, and Lebanon is far greater than what is visible,' Erdogan said. 'For 14 months, a highly bloody and extremely dangerous war has been ongoing right next to Turkey, despite some individuals’ insistence on ignoring it.' Erdogan also said that he has been actively pushing the United Nations to implement 'coercive measures to stop Israeli aggression,' which he claimed 'has now spilled over into Syria and other countries.'

Cruz: ‘Deeply disturbed’ by reports ‘Obama-Biden officials exerte...	Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he is 'very pleased to hear that a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has been reached regarding the conflict in Lebanon.' By Izzy Salant and Menachem Wecker, JNS Although Israel has achieved 'enormous military successes' over the past year against Hezbollah, the Biden administration 'has spent the last four years pathologically obsessed with undermining Israel and boosting Iran,' stated Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) after U.S. President Joe Biden announced a ceasefire deal in Lebanon. 'They are now using the transition period to the Trump administration and a Republican Congress to try to lock in those efforts—and to constrain the incoming administration—by establishing what they believe to be irreversible diplomatic, legal and military policies,' Cruz added. 'However, these and similar international policies are not irreversible.' The senator added that he is 'deeply disturbed' by reports that 'Obama-Biden officials exerted enormous pressure on our Israeli allies to accept this ceasefire' and by how the officials 'are characterizing Israel’s obligations.' 'This pressure and these statements are further efforts to undermine Israel and constrain the incoming Trump administration,' Cruz stated. 'Obama-Biden officials pressured our Israeli allies into accepting the ceasefire by withholding weapons they needed to defend themselves and counter Hezbollah, and by threatening to facilitate a further, broader, binding international arms embargo through the United Nations.' Those U.S. officials aim to 'use Israel’s acceptance of this ceasefire to ensure that Hezbollah and other Iranian terrorist groups remain intact across Lebanon, and to limit Israel’s future freedom of action and self-defense,' Cruz stated. Several of Cruz’s colleagues in Congress also addressed the agreement. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he is 'very pleased to hear that a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has been reached regarding the conflict in Lebanon.' 'I appreciate the hard work of the Biden administration, supported by President Trump, to make this ceasefire a reality,' Graham said. 'This ceasefire will protect Israel from another Oct. 7 and will give the people of Lebanon a break from the fighting.' 'My hope is that we can soon achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and allow peaceful solutions to replace endless conflict,' he added. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the agreement 'marks a vital and productive step, but hopefully not the last.' 'Lebanon’s Parliament can and must select a president free from corruption and Iranian influence,' he added. 'The United States remains committed to ensuring the ceasefire holds with strong and ongoing support for the Lebanese Armed Forces—the true defenders of Lebanon’s sovereignty and people—and for Israel’s right to defend itself against terrorism.' Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) wrote that 'for over a year, Israel has faced ongoing attacks from Hezbollah, a terrorist organization backed by Iran. Today’s agreement will help save lives and allow Israel to fully focus on defeating Hamas.' 'It also makes it clear Hamas is isolated and must free the remaining hostages now,' the senator stated. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) wrote earlier in the day about the ceasefire deal that there was 'a clear message to all Iranian proxies: The Trump administration will not tolerate violence against Israel. The Middle East cannot continue to be a breeding ground for terror and chaos.' Rep. Katie Boyd Britt (R-Ala.) wrote that she supports 'the democratically elected government of Israel’s decision to enter this ceasefire deal.' 'I also stand with Israel in her right to enforce this agreement, including striking Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon if necessary,' Britt said. 'The United States stands with Israel today and always.' Rep. Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) said that the agreement 'is a breakthrough that will save countless innocent lives and demonstrates that diplomacy can work in the Middle East.' 'Hopefully, his efforts will create momentum for a ceasefire in Gaza and a lessening of violence in the entire region,' the congressman said. ‘Pave the way for a more stable future’ U.S. Jewish groups applauded the deal. The Jewish Federations of North America welcomed the agreement and said Israel 'has long endured the unacceptable threat of Iran’s proxy Hezbollah amassing heavy weapons along its northern border, and since Oct. 8, 2023, firing regular missiles, drones and rockets, forcing over 60,000 people to evacuate their homes.' 'Throughout this harrowing period, Jewish Federations have been there to support Israel’s communities, and we will continue to support them in their needs going forward,' it stated. 'We are hopeful that this agreement will help pave the way for a more stable future, allow Israel’s citizens to return to their homes, and end the unacceptable rain of rockets and missiles that have terrorized Israel’s civilians these past 14 months.' The American Jewish Committee stated that 'as Israel has done time and time again, it has chosen to agree to a ceasefire at the risk of huge potential costs.' 'To protect this peace, enforcement from the Lebanese army, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, and U.S. Central Command will be paramount,' the AJC stated. 'As long as Hezbollah, funded by the Iranian regime to eradicate Israel, remains on its border, Israel and her people are under threat.' It added that 'much of this deal is based on the original tenets of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which has failed to be enforced since its adoption in 2006.' 'While AJC welcomes the new enforcement mechanisms in this agreement, we will continue to advocate for a reassessment of UNIFIL’s mandate and operations,' AJC added. 'As recently as last August, UNIFIL’s mandate was simply renewed without the necessary adjustments to address the threat posed by Hezbollah. Without meaningful reforms, UNIFIL will continue to fall short of its mandate.' AIPAC stated that 'this war was a direct byproduct of Iran arming and funding its terror proxy Hezbollah and the international community’s failure to enforce Security Council Resolution 1701 after the 2006 war.' It called on the international community to 'remedy its failures following the 2006 war and ensure Hezbollah can’t rearm or operate south of the Litani River.' Mark Mellman, president and CEO of Democratic Majority for Israel, stated that the 'ceasefire achievement reaffirms our long-standing belief that this is the most pro-Israel administration in American history.' He added that the agreement 'protects Israel’s security.' 'Reminder: There is no peace agreement. The goal of the Tehran regime and its proxy terror armies (in this case, Hezbollah) remains the destruction of Israel,' wrote Gerald Steinberg, founder and president of NGO Monitor. 'In response, and based on the lessons of the past 14 months, Israel will act with force and preemptively whenever its survival is threatened.'

Israeli experts deem the PA unfit to govern in Gaza	The report describes the P.A. as lacking legitimacy among Palestinians and failing to maintain control over its territories, with parts falling under Hamas’s influence. By JNS The Palestinian Authority is unfit to govern the Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the Israel-Hamas war, according to a new report by the Kohelet Policy Forum. The 112-page report, authored by attorneys Yishai Rivlin, Yigal Ram, Boaz Ha’etzni and Noga Arbel, presents a critical analysis of the P.A.’s ideology and actions. It concludes that the P.A. promotes a culture of terror and jihad rather than fostering peaceful coexistence. The report, titled, 'Why the Palestinian Authority Must Not Rule Gaza,' highlights that the P.A.’s education system indoctrinates children with hatred toward Israel and Jews, using textbooks and educational programs to portray Israel as an enemy. Furthermore, the P.A. consistently refuses to recognize Israel as a Jewish state, omitting it from official maps and labeling Israeli cities as Palestinian. This refusal is seen as a fundamental barrier to peace efforts. The report, which can be read in its full Hebrew version here, also accuses the P.A. of actively encouraging terrorism by praising terrorists, hosting commemorative events in their honor and providing financial incentives through salaries to imprisoned terrorists and their families. These payments are viewed as significant motivators for continued violence and antithetical to peace. Additionally, the report describes the P.A. as lacking legitimacy among Palestinians and failing to maintain control over its territories, with parts falling under Hamas’s influence. Systemic human rights violations and corruption further undermine its credibility as a governing body. The authors warn that allowing the P.A. to govern Gaza without significant ideological changes could result in another terrorist entity on Israel’s southern border, echoing concerns from post-2005 when Israel withdrew from Gaza, leading to increased Hamas control. From a human rights perspective, the report argues that P.A. governance would not improve conditions for Gazans but rather perpetuate existing abuses. The report, which was written in September but first made public by Israel National News on Tuesday, includes findings that have been echoed by some Israeli Knesset members who have likewise come out against proposals involving the P.A. in governing Gaza. Among the reasons given by the MKs were doubts regarding the feasibility of armed P.A. officers working alongside the Israeli military. Despite U.S. assertions made in September regarding the P.A.’s commitment to peace, ongoing terror attacks claimed by Fatah militias cast doubt on these commitments’ sincerity. Talks between the P.A. and Hamas that took place in Cairo toward the end of September regarding a unity government for Gaza further complicate the situation, as such a government would result in Hamas still being in control of the Strip in some fashion or another after the war. The Kohelet Policy Forum’s report becomes even more relevant amid the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah and continued efforts by the U.S. government to bring about an end to the conflict in Gaza as well. The report’s findings underscore the need for substantial reforms within the P.A. before it can be considered a viable governing body in the Gaza Strip.

Residents of southern Lebanon began returning to their homes on Wednesday morning, prompting Israeli warnings not to do so until the army withdraws from Lebanon. By Pesach Benson, TPS Hours after the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire took effect, Israeli forces identified several vehicles in Lebanese territory with suspects in a no-go zone, the Israel Defense Forces said on Wednesday morning. 'The forces fired to prevent them from reaching the zone, and the suspects moved away,' the IDF said. 'The Air Force is prepared to operate throughout Lebanon and the air defense system is on high alert. As of this time, there is no change in the Home Front Command’s instructions.' Meanwhile, residents of southern Lebanon began returning to their homes on Wednesday morning, prompting Israeli warnings not to do so until the army withdraws from Lebanon. 'The IDF remains deployed in its positions inside southern Lebanon,' tweeted Col. Avichay Adraee, the Israel Defense Force’s Arabic-language spokesperson. 'You are prohibited from heading towards the villages that the IDF has ordered to be evacuated or towards IDF forces in the area. For your safety and the safety of your family members, refrain from moving to the area. We will inform you when it is safe to return home.' The two-month ceasefire went into effect at 4:00 AM. Under the terms of the agreement, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its armed presence from areas of southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. Israeli forces will also withdraw from southern Lebanon in stages. The Lebanese Armed Forces are to be deployed in southern Lebanon including along the 120 km border with Israel, as will monitors from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hezbollah not required to disarm under ceasefire deal	13-point Lebanon truce allows Hezbollah to continue to function, with no explicit requirement to disarm, while Israel commits to avoiding military action in most of Lebanon unless Lebanese army found to be unable to remove threats to Israel. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News At 4:00 a.m. Wednesday morning, a ceasefire agreement between Israel, Lebanon, and the Hezbollah terrorist organization went into effect, ending active combat in southern Lebanon and Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern and central Israel. The truce, brokered by the United States and France, includes 13 different provisions, along with assurances provided by the Biden administration to Israel, delineating Israel's right to self-defense in Lebanon under the ceasefire. While the deal is anchored in the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, passed in August 2006 to end the Second Lebanon War, it makes no explicit call for the disarming of terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, as UNSC 1701 had. Instead, the agreement merely requires that Hezbollah and other armed groups in Lebanon refrain from attacking Israel. Furthermore, the deal obliges the Lebanese government to supervise all weapons sales, transfers, and production in Lebanese territory, with unauthorized arms production facilities to be dismantled, along with unauthorized military bases and infrastructure. Unauthorized weapons are to be confiscated by the Lebanese military or security apparatus. Israel will also be obliged to refrain from carrying out any military activity in Lebanese territory, so long as the truce is maintained, though Israel will retain the right to conduct aerial reconnaissance in Lebanese airspace, so long as aircraft do not break the sound barrier. The text of the agreement reaffirms the right of both Israel and Lebanon to self-defense, while a letter from the Biden administration delineates more precisely Israel's right to act militarily in Lebanon both in response to violations of the ceasefire, and to security threats by armed groups in Lebanon. Israel will, according to the U.S. letter of understanding, have the right to act militarily against security threats in Lebanon, including any violations of the ceasefire deal in southern Lebanon, with no limit to Israel's freedom of action. North of the Litani River, however, Israel can only act against security threats if the Lebanese army is unable or unwilling to remove the threat. Israel must, whenever possible, inform the U.S. of planned military measures. The implementation of the deal will be overseen by a committee led by the U.S. and including France. Violations of the ceasefire are to be reported to the committee and to the United Nations peacekeeping force (UNIFIL) deployed in southern Lebanon. Israel is required to withdraw all of its forces from Lebanese territory and move south of the Blue Line within 60 days. In addition, the agreement provides for U.S.-brokered talks between Israel and Lebanon to resolve lingering disputes over the precise demarcation of the border. The full list of provisions in the agreement is as follows: Hezbollah and other terror groups are to refrain from attacking Israel Israel is to refrain from carrying out attacks in Lebanon, so long as truce maintained Jerusalem and Beirut are work to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, including removal of Hezbollah from the Israeli border, up to the Litani River Israel and Lebanon will both retain the right to self-defense The Lebanese army is to be sole armed force south of the Litani River after Israel completes its withdrawal within 60 days Beirut is to supervise all arms sales, production and transfers in Lebanon Unauthorized weapon production facilities are to be dismantled Unauthorized military bases and infrastructure and weapons must be dismantled or confiscated A committee, headed by U.S. and including France, will be formed to oversee implementation of the deal Israel and Lebanon are to report violations to the committee and to the UNIFIL mission Lebanon is obliged to use its military to enforce its borders and border crossings Israel must withdraw all forces from Lebanon within 60 days U.S. will promote indirect talks between Jerusalem and Beirut to resolve disputes over the Blue Line, demarcating the Israel-Lebanon frontier The post Hezbollah not required to disarm under ceasefire deal appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/hezbollah-not-required-to-disarm-under-ceasefire-deal/	2024-11-27T00:30:48-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/6dc1ef95-12f0-4104-b4c9-47a21f6967fb.jpg
‘Gazans have been through hell’ – After Lebanon ceasefire, Biden ...	Biden touts ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, while holding out hope truce could lead to breakthrough on hostage deal - and a path to Palestinian statehood. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden on Tuesday touted an agreement brokered by the United States between Israel, Lebanon, and the Hezbollah terror organization paving the way for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah beginning Wednesday morning. Addressing reporters at a White House Rose Garden press conference Tuesday afternoon, Biden announced there was 'good news to report from the Middle East,' after Israel's security cabinet voted to accept a truce with the Iran-backed Hezbollah terror group, and to withdraw all Israeli forces from Lebanese territory within 60 days. 'I just spoke with the prime minister of Israel and Lebanon, and I’m pleased to announce that their governments have accepted the United States’ proposal to end the devastating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah,' Biden said. The president emphasized that the U.S. held Hezbollah, not Israel, responsible for the war on Israel's northern front, which began a day after Hamas' invasion of southern Israel on October 7th, 2023. 'Let’s be clear: Israel did not launch this war. The Lebanese people did not seek that war either, nor did the United States.' Biden added that the ceasefire was 'designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,' rather than a temporary truce in between rounds of fighting. 'What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed — will — I emphasize — will not be allowed to threaten the security of Israel again.' 'We’re determined this conflict will not be just another cycle of violence.' No American troops will be deployed in Lebanon, Biden said, though the U.S. and France will monitor the area to ensure compliance with the truce. The president expressed optimism that Wednesday's ceasefire could be built upon to secure a deal between Israel and Hamas, and lamented the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. 'Just as the Lebanese people deserve a future of security and prosperity, so do the people of Gaza. They too deserve an end to the fighting and displacement.' 'The people of Gaza have been through hell. Their word — their world is absolutely shattered.' 'Over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and the end to the war without Hamas in power — that it becomes possible.' Biden also used the Lebanon truce to reiterate his hope that talks to end the current conflicts in the Middle East may become the basis for negotiations leading to Palestinian statehood. 'Today’s announcement brings us closer to realizing&#8230; a vision for the future of the Middle East where it’s at peace and prosperous and integrated across borders; a future where Palestinians have a state of their own.' The U.S., Biden continued 'remains prepared to conclude a set of historic deals with Saudi Arabia to include a security pact and economic assurances together with a credible pathway for establishing a Palestinian state and the full&#8230; normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.'

US still withholding weapons from Israel, says US House Speaker	This Administration put up roadblock after roadblock on Israel and dragged out this conflict,' says senior Republican official. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration is continuing to punish Israel by delaying shipments of critical weapons and munitions, in order to appease Iranian aggression, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-TN) said on Tuesday evening after news of a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon was announced. 'While the Biden-Harris Administration celebrates this announcement, remember that it is STILL withholding weapons to Israel. This Administration put up roadblock after roadblock on Israel and dragged out this conflict,' wrote Johnson on his X account. In a televised address to the Israeli public on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited 'delays' in arms shipments as one of the reasons why Israel had agreed to the ceasefire. Notably, Netanyahu was vague on the details of the issue, and did not mention the Biden administration as withholding arms. 'They repeatedly appeased Iran rather than show unequivocal support to our closest ally in the region. Israel’s military success has been in spite of the White House, not because of it,' he continued. 'We always hope for peace in the region, and still do during this 60-day ceasefire. But it is President Trump’s Administration that will pave the way to lasting peace, because peace only comes through STRENGTH,' he added. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL), incoming president Donald Trump's pick for National Security Adviser, said that the ceasefire agreement was directly linked to Trump's election. 'Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump,' Waltz wrote on his TX account. 'This is [because] his resounding victory sent a clear message to the rest of the world that chaos won’t be tolerated. I’m glad to see concrete steps towards de-escalation in the Middle East,' Waltz wrote. 'But let’s be clear: The Iran Regime is the root cause of the chaos and terror that has been unleashed across the region. We will not tolerate the status quo of their support for terrorism.'

Israeli Security Cabinet approves truce with Lebanon	The ceasefire is set to go into effect at 10 a.m. local time on Wednesday and last for sixty days. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS The Israeli Security Cabinet voted on Tuesday evening to approve a 60-day truce with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon. An unnamed Israeli official told CNN that Jerusalem’s Security Cabinet, which is responsible for defense-related decisions and composed of senior ministers, voted in favor of the agreement with Lebanon. Earlier on Tuesday, the channel cited an Israeli source familiar with the matter as saying that the prime minister was seeking to bring the deal before the Security Cabinet only, rather than the full Cabinet. Hebrew media has quoted officials as saying that the potential move would be legally sound, as a temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah is considered a security question rather than a political one. According to the reported terms of the agreement, Israel Defense Forces troops are expected to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon over a 60-day 'transition period,' while the country’s official Lebanese Armed Forces is deployed to the border region. Jerusalem has pledged to halt 'any offensive military action against targets in Lebanon, including on the ground, in the air and at sea.' Hezbollah has promised to relocate its 'military infrastructure' north of the Litani River, located some 18 miles north of the border with Israel. The deal includes an oversight committee, which the United States will lead, to monitor implementation and address potential violations. The ceasefire is set to go into effect at 10 a.m. local time on Wednesday, per NBN, which is part of the Hezbollah-aligned Amal movement. An unnamed Israeli official likewise told Axios that the truce is expected to take effect on Wednesday morning, after U.S. President Joe Biden announces it on Tuesday night. As the Israeli Security Cabinet met to approve the deal on Tuesday evening, air-raid sirens were activated across the Galilee and Haifa regions, warning of more rocket and missile fire from Lebanon. Meanwhile, the IDF issued evacuation orders for structures in the Lebanese cities of Tyre and Sidon, announcing that the Israeli military would 'soon act against Hezbollah infrastructure located in the area.' Hassan Fadlallah, a Lebanese lawmaker representing Hezbollah’s March 8 Alliance, told the Reuters wire agency earlier on Tuesday that the terrorist organization would 'remain active' after the war ends, including to help rebuild areas destroyed by Israeli airstrikes. A Hezbollah official told Qatar’s Al Jazeera following the Israeli approval that the terror group still needs to 'examine the points that Netanyahu agreed to before the [Lebanese] government signs tomorrow.' Authorities in northern Israel have canceled public gatherings until Thursday, anticipating a flare-up in violence ahead of the truce. On Sunday, Hezbollah fired more than 240 projectiles at Israel, marking one of the most intense days of hostilities since the Lebanese terror group joined the war in support of Palestinian Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023. Lawmakers of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee sent an urgent request to Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday afternoon to reveal the terms of the agreement under discussion. 'Following publications about Israel’s intention to sign a deal in the north, we, representatives of the undersigned coalition and opposition parties, demand to summon Defense Minister Israel Katz, to present the principles of the agreement,' the coalition Knesset members Amit Halevi (Likud) and Ohad Tal (Religious Zionism) stated. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a senior member of the Security Cabinet, informed Netanyahu of his four demands for supporting the agreement, Israel’s Channel 12 News reported. The Religious Zionism leader reportedly pressed the premier to call a Cabinet vote on every withdrawal from Lebanon, respond to Lebanese violations of the deal within 48 hours, hold the government in Beirut responsible for any attack from Lebanese territory and ban rebuilding destroyed infrastructure in Southern Lebanon. Hezbollah has attacked the Jewish state nearly daily for more than a year, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones across the border. More than 60,000 residents of Israel’s north remain internally displaced due to the ongoing cross-border attacks from Lebanon. The attacks have killed at least 76 people in Israel, including 31 IDF soldiers and six foreign nationals. More than 700 have been wounded. Jerusalem has escalated attacks on Hezbollah since adding the return of displaced citizens to northern Israel to its official war goals on Sept. 17. On Sept. 30, the IDF announced that ground forces had moved to 'limited, localized and targeted raids' inside Lebanon. More than 40 IDF troops were killed by Hezbollah terrorists during the two-month-long ground maneuver, according to official military data. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which brought an end to the 2006 Lebanon War but was never enforced, mandated the complete removal of Hezbollah south of the Litani River and banned the presence of armed groups in Lebanon except for the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers.

Yona Betzalel Brief, a 23-year-old soldier, died of injuries from Hamas’s October 7 attack, the Israel Defense Forces announced on Tuesday. He served as a combat medic in the elite Duvdevan Unit. Brief had been hurt in a counterterror operation in Tulkarem in May 2023. On the morning of October 7, the Modiin resident rushed to help defend Kibbutz Kfar Aza. During the battle, he was injured and placed on life support. Brief was on life support for 413 days before succumbing to his injuries. He is survived by his parents. More than 50 Israelis were massacred at Kfar Aza. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Israel to build high-tech security wall along Jordanian border	While the exact completion timeline remains under wraps, ministry officials indicated construction will begin within months. By Jewish Breaking News Although Jordan remains one of Israel’s few Arab allies, Iranian smuggling networks are treating their shared border like an open highway for terror operations. That’s all about to change. Defense Minister Israel Katz announced Tuesday he’s won approval for a sophisticated multi-million shekel border barrier, loaded with cutting-edge sensors and surveillance networks, to close a critical 309-mile security gap that Tehran has increasingly exploited. 'We see a relentless and institutionalized Iranian effort to establish an eastern front against the State of Israel. I have decided to intensively promote the construction of the fence on the eastern border between Israel and Jordan. We are going to do it very quickly,' Katz said. Katz first called for the construction of a fence on the border with Jordan in late August, when he served as Foreign Minister. At the time he accused Tehran of working to create an 'eastern terror front against Israel.' However, security officials have been raising red flags about the border’s vulnerabilities since early 2023. Former IDF Central Commander Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs went so far as to send a formal warning letter to IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi before his retirement. The October 7 Hamas attack only intensified these concerns, though questions remain about whether the IDF will boost troop presence along the new barrier or rely primarily on technology. According to the Jerusalem Post, Katz had to overcome longtime opposition from Finance Minister Betzalel Smotrich, who had repeatedly blocked funding despite growing security concerns. Sources suggest Katz may have leveraged rescinding any new administrative detention orders against violent Jewish activists in Judea and Samaria to secure Smotrich’s cooperation. While the exact completion timeline remains under wraps, ministry officials indicated construction will begin within months. Defense Ministry Director-General Eyal Zamir has already ordered Brig. Gen. Eran Ofir’s engineering division to begin mapping the challenging terrain and producing specialized barrier materials.'

Nearly 1 million migrants have entered the US through the Biden-H...	Total migrant encounters recorded by law enforcement have exceeded nine million since Biden took office. By Joseph Simonson, The Washington Free Beacon Up to one million migrants are expected to have entered the United States under the controversial CPB One program by the time President Joe Biden leaves office, with the figure already nearing 900,000, according to internal Department of Homeland Security data obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. CBP One allows migrants who want to claim asylum in the United States to apply for the program in their home country using a mobile phone application. Those migrants are then given court dates, which are often scheduled years later. The Biden administration broadly expanded the program last year under the belief that it would ease pressure on the southern border. That decision prompted criticism from Republicans who said CBP One was nothing more than a way to facilitate illegal immigration and mask the true number of individuals entering the country. Migrants who enter the country via CBP One are not counted by law enforcement agencies as traditional border crossers. However few are aware of the scale of CBP One. Data obtained by the Free Beacon show that more than 880,620 migrants have been processed with the program since Nov. 2, 2023. The data show a plurality of the migrants, more than 210,000, have come from Venezuela. That's in addition to 175,000 arrivals from Cuba, 152,000 from Mexico, and 146,000 from Haiti. More than 453,000 received parole at a foreign airport, meaning those migrants took a flight from another country and were able to freely roam the United States once they landed. Data reveal that migrants have used the CBP One app from six continents. Biden pledged last year that DHS would only allow roughly 43,000 CBP One appointments a month. That number quickly rose without any public announcement, the Free Beacon reported earlier this year. DHS officials who spoke with the Free Beacon believe that the program is on pace to hit the million-migrant mark by Biden’s last day. Such a figure in just over a year is staggeringly high compared to previous administrations. In 2018, for example, law enforcement encountered just under 400,000 migrants at the southern border—less than half the amount the Biden administration has allowed to enter the United States via CBP One. Total migrant encounters recorded by law enforcement have exceeded nine million since Biden took office. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was impeached in January over his handling of the border crisis. Among the charges listed in his articles of impeachment was the creation of CBP One, described as 'a series of categorical parole programs never authorized by Congress for foreign nationals outside of the United States.' President-elect Donald Trump is expected to severely curtail or end CBP One. Trump said on the campaign trail that after he takes office, 'The border will be sealed. The invasion will be stopped. The migrant flights will end, and Kamala's app for illegals will be shut down immediately, within 24 hours.' The chaos on the southern border is considered a primary reason why Trump won his second term, as well as the popular vote—a first for a Republican since 2004. Trump has pledged to undertake the largest deportation effort in U.S. history, although those close to him say law enforcement will first target illegal aliens with criminal backgrounds. Such a policy has led to criticism from Democrats, although it appears to be popular with the public. A CBS poll released Sunday found that 57 percent of voters approve of Trump 'starting [a] program to deport all immigrants in [the] U.S. illegally.'

Israeli professor under fire after accusing IDF of ‘ethnic cleans...	Sociology professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University calls for IDF soldiers to refuse orders, accusing the Jewish state of 'ethnically cleansing' the northern Gaza Strip during the ongoing war against Hamas. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli university lecturer is under fire after she accused the military of 'ethnically cleansing' the northern Gaza Strip during the ongoing war against the Hamas terror organization, and penned an opinion article calling on Israeli soldiers to refuse orders during the war in Gaza. Earlier this month, the left-wing Hebrew daily Ha’aretz published an article coauthored by journalist Meron Rapoport and Dr. Yael Barda, assistant professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem’s Department of Sociology and Anthropology. 'Israel has perpetrated ethnic cleansing in the northern Gaza Strip,' reads the opening line of the opinion piece. 'Through starvation, denial of health care, bombings and the destruction of both homes and the schools where the displaced sought shelter, Israel has forced the vast majority of residents of the Jabalya refugee camp, Beith Hanoun and Beit Lahia to leave their place of residence.' Rapoport and Barda also explicitly call on Israeli soldiers to refuse orders from their commanding officers in wartime. 'Refusing to serve was and remains the strongest card we have to play against the current government's plans for perpetual war. And that's especially true now, since Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election may well remove the brakes that have until now prevented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his partners from completing the ethnic cleansing of Gaza City.' On Monday, the pro-Israel activist group Im Tirtzu called on Hebrew University administrators to fire Barda over her accusations and call to refuse orders. 'I have just returned from a long period of reserve duty, in Gaza and Lebanon, and I discover that a senior lecturer at the university where I studied is calling for defection and claiming that what the IDF does in Gaza is ethnic cleansing,' said the CEO of Im Tirtzu, Matan Jerafi. 'It is unbelievable that students who have returned from reserve duty should study with her?

‘No Way In Hell Gaza Is a State’ – Republican senator tussles wit...	‘Beyond the pale’ - Republican senator fires back after Canadian foreign minister defends decision to enforce International Criminal Court arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. By World Israel News Staff Canada’s foreign minister defended the Trudeau government’s decision to enforce arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court at The Hague against Israeli leaders, pushing back on criticism by Republican lawmakers last week. Speaking with the news website Politico in an interview published Sunday, Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly responded to threats by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a senior Republican in the upper chamber of Congress where Republicans are poised to take control in January, after Graham warned Congress would impose sanctions on allied nations which aid and abet the ICC decision. 'Canada will take its decision,' Joly said. 'Then the U.S. will take its decision.' 'We abide by international norms, including the fact that we’re a founding member of the ICC.' 'For us, it is not a political question. It is a legal question, and it is part also of our own legal system that we respect the jurisdiction of the ICC. Period.' Joly noted that unlike Canada, the U.S. is not a signatory to the Rome Statute which established the ICC. On Monday, Senator Graham fired back, calling Canada’s support for the ICC arrest warrants 'beyond the pale.' 'The idea that the International Criminal Court seeking arrest warrants against Israel’s Prime Minister and former Defense Minister is an act of international rules-based order is beyond the pale,' Graham said in a press release. 'The prosecutor who instigated the arrest warrants is under investigation. The ICC, in the eyes of the majority of Congress, is acting as a rogue organization asserting jurisdiction based on their belief that something bad happened.' Graham ripped the ICC for arguing that the Gaza Strip has standing as a sovereign state, and emphasized that Israel is not a party to the ICC treaty. 'Israel is not a member of the ICC, and there is no way in hell that Gaza is part of a recognized Palestinian state. This abuse of jurisdiction has no limits.' 'Why couldn’t the ICC come after an American president or Secretary of Defense if they feel we have done wrong?' 'This is about sovereignty and some semblance of the rule of law. From an American point of view, the ICC has no accountability. For them to come after us would be an attack on our sovereignty. Since we’re not a member, and we are a mature democracy with an independent judiciary, like Israel, we would have little to no say.' The U.S., Graham added, will 'act decisively to reject' actions by the ICC outside of its jurisdiction targeting democratic countries. 'We will make it loud and clear that those countries who assist in enforcing the arrest warrants – even if they are close allies – will hit a wall of resistance in America.'

Netanyahu faces possible backlash within Likud over Lebanon cease...	Israel is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, according to these opponents of a ceasefire agreement now with Hezbollah. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News While the Lebanese foreign minister said Tuesday that he hopes an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal will be agreed upon by nightfall, there are loud voices in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s own party who are throwing cold water on the idea of stopping the fight now against the Iranian terror proxy. Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli stated, 'The series of strikes on Hezbollah's top brass and the ground moves have brought tremendous operational achievements. Under no circumstances should they be sold in exchange for quiet&#8230;. We have already learned firsthand what the interest rates are for buying quiet in the Middle Eastern bazaar.' Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter announced on X Monday night without going into details that 'If the agreement with Lebanon is a 'copy-paste' of Resolution 1701 — I won't support it.' He then said he would decide on his stance after hearing the details of the planned deal, which is supposed to be presented to the political-security cabinet towards evening Tuesday. Several Likud backbenchers have expressed firm opposition to signing an agreement before Hezbollah suffers a much more serious, if not fatal, blow. Calling it a 'return to the approach of October 6,' MK Moshe Saada posted that, 'Instead of reaching an overwhelming victory deal thanks to the achievements of the last few month&#8230;the State of Israel is the one deterred.' 'We do not have a mandate to keep the rocket threat alive and kicking,' he continued, 'and we do not have a moral mandate to ask the residents of the north to return to their homes, when it’s clear to everyone that a large part of the Lebanese residents who will be allowed to return to their villages are actually terrorists who are just waiting for another chance.' He pleaded with Netanyahu to instead 'listen to the council heads, the residents of the north, and the majority of the country’s people who demand [Hezbollah’s] surrender and submission and not our capitulation.' MK Dan Illouz agreed, writing on X, 'Israel is seemingly choosing to retreat instead of leveraging tactical achievements into strategic ones.' The proposed deal states that the Lebanese Army will take the IDF’s place in southern Lebanon within 60 days, yet, he pointed out, 'This army is controlled by a government in which Hezbollah is a key component.' He noted with contempt the recourses Israel has if Hezbollah returns to the south and rearms. The international oversight body to be established will be 'an empty vessel,' he said. 'As if anyone in the world will lift a finger as a result of an [Israeli] complaint.' An American letter of commitment stating that Israel will have freedom of action to actively deter Hezbollah if it breaks the agreement will be useless as well, he added, as previous presidents’ written promises to Israeli leaders were not honored by their successors. If this deal is signed, he ended, 'Hezbollah is still on its feet, ready to rebuild its strength [and] the next round is just a matter of time.' Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yisrael Katz talked tough upon meeting with UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert Tuesday. He demanded 'effective enforcement from UNIFIL' of any agreement but also warned, 'What was will no longer be. We will act against every threat, anytime and anywhere. Any house in southern Lebanon that is rebuilt and established as a terrorist base will be destroyed. Every rearmament and terrorist regrouping will be struck, every attempt to smuggle weapons will be thwarted and any threat to our forces or to Israeli citizens will be destroyed immediately.' According to Channel 12’s Amit Segal, the deal is purposefully being brought to a vote only in the political-security cabinet, and not to the larger Cabinet as representing the government as a whole, or the Knesset, the people’s representatives, where the opposition is greater. The excuse given for doing this, he said in a post on Telegram, is that the deal is only a ceasefire agreement and not a political one.

Senior Israeli minister pushing to occupy Gaza, encourage volunta...	Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich says Israel must occupy the Gaza Strip and promote the voluntary transfer of the Palestinian Arab population out of the coastal enclave - and out of Judea and Samaria as well. By World Israel News Staff A senior Israeli government minister is pushing for the IDF to impose a lasting military occupation of the Gaza Strip, and for Israel to pursue a policy of voluntary population transfer, encouraging Palestinian Arabs to leave the Gaza Strip. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) addressed a conference hosted by the Yesha Council - the umbrella organization representing Jewish towns in Judea and Samaria - Monday night, during which he argued that Israel 'can and must occupy the Gaza Strip.' 'We don’t need to be scared of this word,' Smotrich continued, referring to the term 'occupation,' which has often been used by Israel's critics to refer to the Jewish state's presence in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. Smotrich expressed optimism that after inauguration day on January 20th, Israel will be able to apply sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria, and take Palestinian statehood off of the table. 'A nationalist government in Israel with Trump in the White House will be able to bring a strategic change against our enemies, changing the status of Judea and Samaria and taking the dangerous issue of Palestinian statehood off of the agenda.' The minister also called for the government to promote the 'voluntary emigration' of Gazans. 'It’s possible to create a situation in which Gaza will have less than half its current population within two years,' Smotrich said, adding that such a policy of voluntary transfer could be pursued also in Judea and Samaria. Earlier this year, Israeli media outlets reported that the Israeli government is in talks with foreign governments, including the Republic of Congo, to secure destinations willing to receive voluntary Palestinian emigres interested in leaving the Gaza Strip. 'Congo will be willing to take in migrants, and we’re in talks with others,' a senior Israeli official told Zman Israel in January.

UN dropping jurist who refuses to accuse Israel of genocide	The Wall Street Journal claims that Special Adviser's refusal to accuse Israel of genocide was unacceptable to Alice Wairimu Nderitu’s bosses. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The United Nations has decided not to renew the contract of its Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide who has refused to accuse Israel of intentionally committing mass murder. In her statements ever since the Jewish state went to war with the Hamas terror organization after its men led a surprise invasion on October 7, 2023 in which they massacred 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, Alice Wairimu Nderitu has been careful to express the need to end the fighting without pointing a culpable finger only at Israel. She harshly condemned Hamas a week after the war began, labeling its attack as 'vicious,' saying its 'continued indiscriminate rocket fire' into Israel was 'unacceptable' and appealing to the terrorists to 'immediately liberate all hostages,' while calling for both sides to cease attacking and negotiate peacefully. In a February statement reacting to the International Court of Justice ordering Israel 'to take all measures within its power' to prevent the commission of 'acts of genocide' in the Gaza Strip, which it had yet to determine were occurring, the senior Kenyan staffer said equally that 'violations of international humanitarian law can never justify the collective punishment of the people in Gaza' and that 'civilians must be protected at all times on both sides.' The Special Adviser would not 'take a position in relation to ongoing judicial proceedings before the Court,' she added. Last month, Nderitu called evenhandedly for urgent diplomatic efforts to end the 'ongoing hostilities,' 'strengthen the protection of innocent civilian populations,' and get humanitarian aid to those 'in dire need of receiving it.' She also 'reiterates her demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, for the full compliance by the parties at war with obligations under international law, as well as for accountability.' In addition, the statement said that the Special Adviser 'reiterates that her prevention mandate does not allow her to express a position on whether the crime of genocide or any other specific international crime has been committed, which can only be determined by a competent, independent and impartial court of law.' The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) argued Monday that the refusal to outright condemn Israel did not sit well with the higher-ups in the international body, such as Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Volker Turk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, who have sharply criticized Israel’s actions in fighting Hamas over the past year. It is the reason for Alice Wairimu Nderitu being told to go home after almost five years on the job, the WSJ editorial said. The Palestinians and their supporters in the UN have been accusing Israel of committing genocide against them for years, if not decades. The WSJ pointed out that Nderito’s office had put out a guidance paper in 2022 on when it is proper to call a situation 'genocide' because of 'its frequent misuse.' Rather than citing the Palestinians, she gave the examples of the Holocaust, the Hutus’ massacre of the Tutsis in Rwanda, the Serbian slaughter of Bosnian Muslims, and said it was possible that the ethnic killings then taking place in Sudan could be included as well. 'As a legal matter,' the paper opined in part, 'establishing a pattern of violence as a genocide requires demonstrating intent. Israel’s campaign of self-defense doesn’t qualify. The war against Hamas has had many deaths, but Israel’s strategy is intended to dismantle a terrorist regime, not eliminate an ethnic group.' But 'That’s not what the anti-Israel cabal at the U.N. want to hear,' it said, while accusing the body of having 'long ago lost credibility as a moral arbiter' and 'hitting a new low' in its 'assault on Israel.'

Pope Francis walks back Gaza ‘genocide’ comments	The Roman Catholic Church's top pontiff claims his call for a probe into allegations of genocide in the Gaza Strip was taken out of context, emphasizes Hamas should 'no longer exist in this world.' By World Israel News Staff Pope Francis issued a clarification Monday regarding comments he made recently on the ongoing war between Israel and the Hamas terror organization, claiming that his words had been taken out of context. Last week, the Italian daily La Stampa published excerpts from Hernán Reyes Alcaide’s new book, Hope Never Disappoints. Pilgrims Towards a Better World, including quotes from the pontiff regarding Israel's war in the Gaza Strip. 'According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,' Pope Francis was quoted as saying. 'We should investigate carefully to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.' The quotes attributed to the pope sparked an international backlash from Jewish groups, with the Coalition for Jewish Values (CJV), representing over 2,500 traditional, Orthodox rabbis, B’nai B’rith and The Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM) all denouncing Pope Francis' remarks. Following the wave of criticism, Pope Francis said during an interfaith gathering in the Vatican Monday that Alcaide had taken his comments out of context. 'I did not claim that Israel committed genocide,' the pope said. 'I was shown materials from the war, and I said that if this is true, then it needs to be investigated. I understand what is happening in Gaza. I think Hamas should no longer exist in the world, but the war should also not be prolonged.' During the interfaith meeting, formerly Guatemala's chief rabbi, Rabbi Yosef Garmon, confronted Pope Francis over his remarks. 'You cannot say that Israel must be investigated for genocide,' said Rabbi Garmon, who serves as a tank commander in the IDF. 'Look at my fellow soldiers who died from our unit.' 'They died because we entered Gaza only to search for the terrorists and to protect the innocent. Israel also protects the Palestinians and liberates them from Hamas. Any other country would bomb them from the air and eliminate this threat in one day.' 'Israel has the capability to end the war in one day and erase Gaza entirely, but it did not act that way and risked its soldiers to prevent the killing of innocents. You should investigate those who call to investigate Israel - not the other way around.'

Nighttime Hezbollah rocket attack wounds two in Nahariya	A fire was also reported in the northwestern coastal city, though it was unclear whether it was sparked by a rocket impact or interception debris. By JNS Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah launched 10 rockets at the Western Galilee overnight Monday, wounding two people in Nahariya, one of them seriously. The couple, a 70-year-old woman and 80-year-old man whose apartment suffered a direct hit, were evacuated to the city’s Galilee Medical center in serious and mild condition, respectively, according to Magen David Adom emergency medical service spokesperson Zaki Heller.

Credit: Magen David Adom Spokesperson pic.twitter.com/ibI1uHhUBg &mdash; Magen David Adom (@Mdais) November 25, 2024 A fire was also reported in the northwestern coastal city, though it was unclear whether it was sparked by a rocket impact or interception debris. Approximately two hours later, the Israeli Air Force intercepted a drone that had crossed into the northern Golan Heights from Syria, triggering sirens in Kibbutz Merom Golan. The Monday night attacks came after Hezbollah launched over 20 rockets at the upper and western Galilee regions earlier in the day, lightly wounding a 75-year-old man in Nahariya. He was evacuated to the city’s Galilee Medical Center for further treatment, according to MDA. Meanwhile, the Israeli military’s Home Front Command on Monday evening tightened its defensive guidelines for the Golan Heights and northern border communities following a situational assessment. The new guidelines come as Israel braces for a potential escalation by Hezbollah as a ceasefire deal looms.

Brooklyn Holocaust survivors receive life-changing hearing aids	AJCF joined forces with the Jewish Community Council of Greater Coney Island and the Claims Conference to identify survivors most in need of hearing assistance. By Jewish Breaking News The gentle murmur of conversation filled Brooklyn’s Palace Hall this past week as elderly Holocaust survivors came seeking something precious – the chance to hear their grandchildren’s voices clearly again. Through a groundbreaking program by the Miracle-Ear Foundation, these Holocaust survivors are finally receiving the hearing aids that many have gone without for years. 'Sadly, 80 years after the end of the Holocaust, many of the few remaining Holocaust survivors live in poverty and cannot afford hearing aids. Hearing loss significantly impairs their quality of life, emotional and social wellbeing,' explains Jack Simony, who heads the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation (AJCF). AJCF joined forces with the Jewish Community Council of Greater Coney Island and the Claims Conference to identify survivors most in need of hearing assistance. Since 1990, the Miracle-Ear Foundation has provided over 48,000 hearing aids to those in need. The foundation’s ambitious goal is to provide 100 survivors with not just hearing aids but lifetime care and support through their Gift of Sound program. 'We are honored to work with these community partners to provide free hearing aids to restore hearing and improve the lives of these Survivors through the gift of sound,' said Jenni Hargraves, Executive Director of the Miracle-Ear Foundation. 'These hearing aids will be life-changing and allow individuals to better communicate with their families, friends and loved ones.' The timing of Miracle-Ear’s initiative carries deep meaning. As International Holocaust Remembrance Day approaches and the world marks 80 years since the Liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, clear hearing represents more than just improved communication for survivors who endured history’s darkest chapter. It restores dignity and connection to a world that once tried to silence them completely.

As Hezbollah ceasefire emerges, so does Israeli public opposition	The agreement with Lebanon is a big mistake. A historic missed opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah. I understand all the constraints and reasons, and it is still a grave mistake,' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said. By Pesach Benson, TPS A ceasefire agreement between Israel, Lebanon, and Hezbollah appears imminent, with negotiations reportedly nearing resolution and Israeli officials already gearing up for a political battle to sell it to the public on Monday. The emerging agreement is believed to include a ceasefire, Hezbollah’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon followed by the departure of Israeli troops from Lebanese territory. It is believed that the US will lead an international team to monitor the ceasefire while the Israeli military maintains the right to respond with force if Hezbollah violates the agreement. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. 'The test of any arrangement will be one – not in words or formulations, but in enforcement,' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar tweeted. 'Enforcement in two main points: 1. Preventing Hezbollah from descending south from the Litani. 2. Preventing Hezbollah from rebuilding its power and rearming in all of Lebanon.' He added, 'One thing must be clear, and in my opinion, it is clear and agreed upon by all parts of the government and all members of the government: we will not allow a return to October 6. Any violation will be addressed immediately. We will no longer agree under any circumstances to sell the future in exchange for temporary peace in the present.' Cracks in the governing coalition emerged as National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir came out against a ceasefire. 'The agreement with Lebanon is a big mistake. A historic missed opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah. I understand all the constraints and reasons, and it is still a grave mistake,' Ben-Gvir said. In the opposition, MK Benny Gantz insisted that responsibility for northern Israel’s security should not be placed in the hands of international monitors. 'We must not return to the reality of October 6. The [Israel Defense Forces] must maintain full freedom of action in the face of threats in Lebanon and continue offensive activity against Hezbollah infrastructure until a desired settlement is achieved,' said Gantz, a former military chief of staff. Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avichai Stern denounced an emerging ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, warning it could lead to 'another October 7th' in Israel’s northern region. 'I don’t understand how we went from total victory to total surrender. Why aren’t we finishing what we started?!' Stern said in a statement. 'We managed to destabilize Hezbollah, and instead of continuing to crush the organization and demolish it to dust, we’re giving it oxygen and performing resuscitation?' He also warned that the agreement would mean the city’s 22,000 residents would get back 'a destroyed city without security and without a future.' The Hostages and Missing Families Forum warned that an agreement that didn’t take the hostages into account would be a success for Hezbollah. 'An agreement without the repatriation of abductees means an explicit concession by the Israeli government on political and security levers essential for their return,' the Forum said. 'Hezbollah and Hamas are an integral part of the Iranian Axis of Evil. The October attack was launched by Hamas acting on the behalf of Iran and Hezbollah joined the war and linked its fate with Hamas while itself making a direct and explicit connection to the war in Gaza and the October massacre.' After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Special counsel moves to drop all charges in election interferenc...	U.S. District Court judge Tanya Chutkan will need to approve the request before the case is dismissed. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Special Counsel Jack Smith has asked a judge to drop all charges in his election interference case against President-elect Donald Trump, citing a Justice Department policy that sitting presidents cannot be indicted or prosecuted. 'The Department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated,' Smith wrote in a six-page filing. Trump's team—which has criticized Smith's investigations as a partisan 'weaponization' of the Justice Department aimed at undermining the former president—celebrated the motion to dismiss the case as a 'major victory for the rule of law.' 'The American People re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to Make America Great Again. Today's decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump, and is a major victory for the rule of law,' Trump communications director Steven Cheung said in a Monday statement. 'The American People and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.' U.S. District Court judge Tanya Chutkan will need to approve the request before the case is dismissed. Smith charged Trump last year with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and illegally retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump pleaded not guilty to all felony charges in that case and took the election interference battle to the Supreme Court, winning on the grounds of presidential immunity. Following the High Court's ruling, Smith filed a new indictment, to which Trump also pleaded not guilty. After Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this month, Smith signaled he would begin winding down the case against the president-elect. Smith plans to 'finish his work and resign' before Trump has the chance to remove him, individuals familiar with the special counsel's plans said. Trump in an October interview vowed to fire Smith 'within two seconds' of taking office.

US seeking to leverage Lebanon ceasefire for Gaza deal	Fifty-one of the hostages are still alive, according to the latest Israeli intelligence assessments. By JNS U.S. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Brett McGurk was scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss using a potential ceasefire in Lebanon as a stepping stone toward a similar agreement to halt hostilities in Gaza, the White House said on Monday. Deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday that the talks in Saudi Arabia will focus on a Lebanon ceasefire deal as a 'catalyst' for a ceasefire agreement with the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza that would include releasing the 101 hostages still held by terrorists in Gaza. Fifty-one of the hostages are still alive, according to the latest Israeli intelligence assessments. Ninety-seven were kidnapped in the Hamas terror invasion of the northwestern Negev on Oct. 7, 2023. Given the intense military pressure on Gaza and the harsh conditions the hostages have endured for over a year, officials fear the actual number of survivors might be even lower. The Israeli Cabinet was set to vote on a U.S.-negotiated ceasefire proposal with Lebanon on Tuesday after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved the deal 'in principle,' CNN reported Monday. John Kirby, the White House national security communications adviser, told reporters at a briefing on Monday that an agreement to end the fighting between Israel and Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah was 'close,' but not a done deal. 'We believe that the trajectory of this is going in a very positive direction,' said Kirby. 'But nothing is done until it’s all done, and it’s not done right now.'

Israel bracing for intense Hezbollah attacks ahead of ceasefire	Do not surrender to terrorism. Do not make this shameful agreement,' says northern mayor. By World Israel News Staff Israel expects Hezbollah to intensify its rocket, missile, and drone attacks ahead of a truce, which is expected to be announced in the near future. According to the New York Times, both Israel and Hezbollah have agreed to the terms of a 60-day ceasefire, after the terror group received a 'green light' from Iran to proceed with the truce. Israeli security officials have warned that Hezbollah will likely ramp up its attacks on civilian communities and military assets in Israel in the coming hours, as a final gesture before the pause in fighting. The Home Front Command tightened restrictions on gatherings in northern Israel, including shuttering schools and banning large events, in light of the likelihood of accelerated rocket and missile fire. While the terms of the ceasefire have not been officially made public, it's believed that Israel will withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon for at least 60 days. In return, Hezbollah will move its terror forces north of the Litani River. The embattled Lebanese Army - whose ability to rein in Hezbollah appears doubtful - will be responsible for ensuring that southern Lebanon is free of Hezbollah. Displaced residents of southern Lebanon will be allowed to return to their homes. However, it's unclear whether residents of northern Israel - tens of thousands of whom have been displaced for more than a year - will be able to return to their homes. Many mayors of northern municipalities slammed the expected ceasefire, saying that Israel had not yet restored security to the residents of the north nor decisively defeated Hezbollah. 'Do not surrender to terrorism. Do not make this shameful agreement. This is a sad arrangement, an agreement of surrender by the Israeli government to Hezbollah, an arm of Iran,' Metula Mayor David Azoulay told Hebrew-language outlet Channel 13. 'The threat has not been removed. We will not agree to return to the reality of October 7 in the north,' he added. Azoulay stressed that some 70 percent of the homes in Metula had been damaged by Hezbollah fire, and that reconstruction would take 'at least two years.'

Turkey stands with Palestinians until ‘liberation’ – Erdogan	Turkish president, a strong supporter of Hamas, says Turkey has no plans to restore diplomatic, trade ties with Israel./em> By World Israel News Staff Turkey will support the Palestinians until they are 'liberated' and will continue taking steps to curb 'Israeli aggression,' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. 'What Turkey is doing for Palestine, Gaza, and Lebanon is far greater than what is visible,' Erdogan said at a press conference following a cabinet meeting. 'For 14 months, a highly bloody and extremely dangerous war has been ongoing right next to Türkiye, despite some individuals' insistence on ignoring it,' he continued. Erodgan reiterated his anti-Israel stance, stating that his government 'will not continue and develop its relations with Israel,' according to a summary of his comments published by the Xinua news agency. 'We have cut trade and ties with Israel, period,' Erdogan said. Recent reports indicated that Turkey may serve as a safe haven for Hamas officials and their families, after the terror group was asked to leave its patron state of Qatar. Erdogan has hosted Hamas' senior leadership numerous times, and stressed that Turkey does not classify Hamas as a terror group. The Turkish leader has repeatedly made inflammatory remarks about the Jewish State since the onset of the October 7th war. He has accused Israel of committing 'genocide' against Gazans, called Israel a 'terrorist state,' and said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'worse than Hitler.' Earlier this week, Erdogan praised the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'We support the arrest warrant,' Erdogan said during a speech in Istanbul, urging that EU member states arrest Netanyahu and Gallant should they travel to their territories. 'We consider it important that this courageous decision be carried out by all country members of the accord to renew the trust of humanity in the international system.'

Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner to donate $1 million to the Chabad branch where Rabbi Zvi Kogan worked before his murder; Kushner's brother announces matching $1 million donation. By World Israel News Staff Former President and President-elect Donald Trump's daughter and son-in-law are donating $1 million to the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, in honor of the Israeli-Moldovan Chabad rabbi who was abducted and murdered in the United Arab Emirates last week. Last Thursday, Rabbi Zvi Kogan, 28, aide to the chief rabbi of the UAE and proprietor of a kosher shop in Abu Dhabi, was declared missing. Days later, his murdered body was found by UAE authorities. Three Uzbek nationals have been arrested in connection with the murder. On Monday, Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and former White House advisor, announced that he and his wife Ivanka Trump would donate $1 million to the Chabad branch in the UAE where Kogan had worked. 'Ivanka and I are saddened by the loss of Rabbi Kogan, who was senselessly murdered to stop the historic bridges he was building between Jews and Muslims in the UAE,' Kushner tweeted. Kushner, an architect of the 2020 Abraham Accords that began with the normalization of ties between Israel and the UAE, emphasized the symbolic importance of maintaining a Jewish presence in the Gulf state. 'The success of his work, in partnership with the bold and positive vision of the Emirati government, has been a shining light in the world and a strong counter to the history of division.' 'Before World War 2, Jews and Muslims lived together throughout the Middle East in harmony for many centuries, celebrating their shared values, and the UAE is leading us back to that time. In the UAE, people of all faiths and backgrounds thrive together in an environment of mutual understanding and respect.' 'Ivanka and I will be donating $1 million to the Chabad of UAE and will redouble our efforts to work with the Jewish community and the country’s leadership to build a resilient, vibrant Jewish community in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. We welcome others to join us in this effort.' 'The constant scapegoating of Israel and the Jewish people benefits no one, other than inept leaders who use hatred to deflect from their own shortcomings. It’s time for the world to channel its collective energy to uplift our shared goals and ambitions.' Minutes after Kushner posted his announcement, his younger brother, venture capitalist Joshua Kushner, pledged to match the $1 million donation. 'I am inspired by your and Ivanka’s leadership. Karlie and I will match your donation of 1MM. May we live in a time of peace, unity and acceptance. May Rabbi Kogan’s memory be a blessing.'

Report: Israeli government to accept 2-month ceasefire with Hezbo...	Latest version of ceasefire deal reportedly allows Israel to remain in Lebanese territory for 60 days - followed by full withdrawal, with no security buffer zone south of the Litani River. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to bring the final draft of an American proposal for a ceasefire with the Hezbollah terrorist group to a vote by Israel's security cabinet Tuesday, in the hopes of winning Coalition backing for the controversial deal. According to an Israeli official cited by The Times of Israel Monday night, approval of the ceasefire deal is already a fait accompli, due in part to pressure on Israel by the Biden administration, including threats to withhold American veto power at the United Nations Security Council. The official also hinted the U.S. may refuse to sell the 134 armored D9 military bulldozers requested by the Israeli military. 'We don’t know how long it will last,' the official said regarding the proposed ceasefire. 'It could be a month, it could be a year.' On Monday, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said the administration is 'close' to securing a deal, while emphasizing that 'nothing is done until everything is done.' Under the proposed deal, Israel would retain the right, guaranteed by a letter from the Biden administration, to both retaliate against Hezbollah in Lebanon should the terror group violate the ceasefire, and to disrupt efforts by the Iran proxy to restore its military capabilities. According to a report by Israel's Channel 12 Monday night, the deal now under consideration would include a 60-day ceasefire, during which the IDF would be allowed to remain in southern Lebanon. After the two-month truce, however, Israel would not be permitted to administered a security buffer zone in southern Lebanon, and would withdraw as the Lebanese army takes control over the southern bank of the Litani River. Beirut would be tasked with overseeing weapons sales and production in Lebanon, to ensure Hezbollah does not rearm, while an international committee, headed by the U.S. and including France would ensure compliance with the agreement. Israel will retain the right to act militarily in Lebanon - an element of the deal Israel has regarded as non-negotiable. Right-wing lawmakers have warned against halting the war in Lebanon without achieving a decisive victory against Hezbollah, while Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter, a former chief of Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency and member of the Likud, took to X/Twitter to express his misgivings regarding the proposed deal, emphasizing that he had not yet decided whether to back the plan.

Netanyahu has reportedly agreed in principle to the ceasefire deal and is now mulling how to present the decision to the Israeli public. By World Israel News Staff According to Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, US President Joe Biden and French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron are expected to announce a joint 60-day ceasefire in Lebanon. Netanyahu has reportedly agreed in principle to the ceasefire deal and is now mulling how to present the decision to the Israeli public. Israel requested that France not be granted a role in the monitoring of the agreement, given the country's position on the ICC arrest warrants issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. However, since the Lebanese side insisted on France's involvement, a compromise was reached in which the US would enforce the agreement and France would have a lesser role in monitoring its enforcement. Israel's security cabinet is expected to meet to discuss the details of the agreement between Israel and Lebanon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held several meetings with senior officials on Sunday, and, according to reports, he tentatively agreed to the ceasefire proposal put forward last week by US special envoy to the Middle East, Amos Hochstein. Although the ceasefire deal is not yet finalized, with some unresolved issues, it is expected to include three key provisions and be implemented in three phases. Under the American proposal, which was detailed in reports last week, Hezbollah would be required to withdraw its forces from the Israeli border and north of the Litani River. The group would also be obligated to disarm, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Additionally, a U.S.-led committee would be tasked with monitoring compliance with the ceasefire. Lastly, Israel would retain the right to take military action in Lebanon in response to violations of the ceasefire, but only after the committee has exhausted all efforts to restore peace. The agreement would unfold in three stages: In the first stage, a ceasefire would take effect, during which Hezbollah would withdraw from the southern bank of the Litani River. In the second stage, Israeli forces would pull back from Lebanese territory. Finally, in the third stage, Israel and Lebanon would enter negotiations over disputed border areas.

Gallant to meet Biden admin officials in first trip abroad since ...	U.S. President Joe Biden has denounced the ICC’s Nov. 21 decision to issue arrest warrants for the two Israeli leaders as 'outrageous.' By JNS Former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is scheduled to fly to the United States on Dec. 1 for talks with the Biden administration, in his first foreign trip since the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for him and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Likud lawmaker will travel on a scheduled El Al flight, risking an emergency landing in one of the 123 countries that recognize the jurisdiction of the court in The Hague and are legally obligated to execute any arrest warrant it issues. Gallant was slated to meet his American counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, early last month to discuss 'ongoing Middle East security developments,' but Netanyahu postponed the trip at the last minute. Netanyahu announced Gallant’s firing less than four weeks later, saying it was prompted by disagreements on how to conduct the war against Hamas, Hezbollah and other Iranian terrorist proxies in the region. During the nixed Oct. 9 visit, Gallant was supposed to coordinate with senior U.S. officials, including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. U.S. President Joe Biden has denounced the ICC’s Nov. 21 decision to issue arrest warrants for the two Israeli leaders as 'outrageous.' 'Let me be clear once again: Whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence—none—between Israel and Hamas,' said Biden, adding, 'We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.' The United States is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the ICC in 2002, and does not recognize its authority. Israel also rejects the court’s jurisdiction, but in a legalistic sleight of hand, it has claimed jurisdiction by accepting 'Palestine' as a signatory, even though no such state is recognized under international law. On Friday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán invited Netanyahu to visit Budapest, dismissing the ICC arrest warrant as an 'outrageously brazen' and 'cynical' political act disguised as a judicial one. Hungary is one of Israel’s staunchest allies in the European Union and has blocked on several occasions E.U. initiatives to isolate or punish the Jewish state by preventing the consensus required for some such moves. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Monday that his country will detain Netanyahu and Gallant if they step foot on British soil.

These four Democratic firms raked in $600 million running ads for...	Seventy percent of the campaign's known total spending flowed through these four firms. By Andrew Kerr, The Washington Free Beacon Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign directed nearly $600 million to just four media consulting firms with deep ties to the Democratic establishment, Federal Election Commission records show. The latest available FEC data show the Harris campaign exceeded $880 million in total spending as of October 16, though that number is expected to balloon to $1.5 billion after the Harris campaign files its post-election FEC report on December 5. Seventy percent of the campaign's known total spending flowed through four firms: Media Buying & Analytics, Gambit Strategies, Bully Pulpit Interactive, and Dupont Circle Strategies. Together, these four Democratic firms were largely responsible for distributing Harris's campaign messaging across the nation—an effort that ultimately saw Harris lose all seven swing states and the popular vote but directed huge sums of donor money the firms' way. Media Buying & Analytics A little-known Atlanta-based firm founded in May 2019, Media Buying & Analytics was the top-earning contractor for the Harris campaign, raking in an astonishing $281 million for ad production and placement services as of October 16, FEC records show. If Media Buying & Analytics had its way, its work for the Harris campaign would have been conducted entirely from the shadows. Media Buying & Analytics doesn't have a website, its business is registered to a law office in Atlanta, and the Harris campaign's checks to the company were made out to a UPS store in the city. But Federal Communications Commission filings in 2020 linked Media Buying & Analytics to Canal Partners Media, a well-connected Democratic ad agency that has worked in presidential elections dating back to 1988. Canal Partners Media CEO Bobby Kahn confirmed to Business Insider in 2020 that his company owns Media Buying & Analytics, which was formed specifically to work for President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign. It's not uncommon for consulting firms to create a subsidiary to work exclusively with a presidential campaign in order to create the appearance of a firewall between its work with the campaign and other allied political groups. Kahn is a longtime Democratic political activist who made his name running the gubernatorial campaigns of former Georgia Democratic governor Roy E. Barnes in 1998 and 2002. He was later elected chairman of the Democratic Party of Georgia. Media Buying & Analytics raked in more than $446 million from Biden's 2020 campaign, and parent company Canal Partners Media has worked with a wide range of Democratic politicians and groups, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), and Everytown for Gun Safety. Kahn's firm knows a thing or two about overseeing an exorbitant amount of cash on behalf of losing campaigns. Early this year, Canal Partners Media raked in more than $31 million running ads for Rep. David Trone's (D., Md.) failed Senate campaign. Trone made history in May for pouring a record-breaking $61.8 million of his own money into his bid, only to lose in a blowout to his primary challenger Angela Alsobrooks, who went on to win her first term in the Senate in the November election. It's unclear what Media Buying & Analytics's profit margins were on its $281 million payday from the Harris campaign payments. Canal Partners Media did not return a request for comment. Gambit Strategies Gambit Strategies came in a distant second in Harris campaign contractor payments, bringing in $122 million from the vice president's campaign for media production and placement services. Founded in 2021, Gambit Strategies was a natural fit for the Harris campaign. One of its founding partners, Megan Clasen, was a senior paid media adviser to Biden's 2020 campaign, during which she claims to have executed 'the largest digital ads program ever run by a Democratic campaign.' Prior to that, Clasen led digital advertising efforts for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Before working on the Biden campaign in 2020, Clasen led digital advertising efforts for Democratic Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker's 2018 campaign, a connection that could prove lucrative for Gambit Strategies in the near-future if Pritzker runs for president in 2028, as some political analysts predict. Gambit's other founding partner, Patrick McHugh, also has extensive experience in Democratic campaigns. McHugh led the pro-Biden Priorities USA super PAC in 2020 and before that held senior roles at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee, and several Democratic campaigns. Gambit Strategies did not return a request for comment asking what its profit margins were for its work with the Harris campaign. Bully Pulpit Interactive Founded in 2009 by veterans of former president Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, Bully Pulpit Interactive was paid just over $101 million in Harris campaign payments for media production and placement services. Bully Pulpit Interactive has become one of the most prominent Democratic communications firms since it hit the scene in 2009, growing from an 8-person crew led by Obama campaign veteran Andrew Bleeker to a global behemoth in 2024 with 250 employees and operations in the United States and Europe. Bully Pulpit Interactive played a critical role in shepherding Biden to the White House in 2020, establishing partnerships with social media influencers to spread his message from outside the confines of the campaign. 'We were not the biggest megaphone compared to Trump, so we had to help arm any who were,' Bleeker told the New York Times after the 2020 election. The Harris campaign tried to replicate that strategy in 2024, spending millions of dollars on social media influencers to boost her campaign with young voters, according to the New York Post. But the strategy didn't work for Harris. The vice president failed to capitalize on opportunities to engage with long-form podcast hosts while Trump made the rounds with some of the most prominent hosts on the scene, such as Joe Rogan and Theo Von. Harris ultimately lost support from young voters compared with Biden in 2020, exit polls showed. Bully Pulpit Interactive did not return a request for comment. Dupont Circle Strategies Operating from the shadows, Dupont Circle Strategies was the fourth top-earning Harris campaign contractor, earning more than $94 million for media consulting, production, and placement services. Founded in September 2023, Dupont Circle Strategies has no website and worked exclusively with the Harris campaign, according to FEC records. It's unclear who or what owns Dupont Circle Strategies. As a Delaware corporation, ownership information is shielded from the public. And though the Harris campaign cut its checks to Dupont Circle Strategies to an address in Washington, D.C., the company does not have a business license or permit to operate in the district, according to business records reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. Public records indicate, however, that Dupont Circle Strategies could share ties with Chong and Koster, a D.C.-based Democratic consulting firm also known as C Plus K. The firm claims to have pioneered the use of Facebook ads as the primary form of voter contact for winning campaigns, starting in 2012, when it managed digital strategy for Democrat Bridget Mary McCormack's campaign for chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. Chong and Koster has worked closely with the DNC since 2016, according to FEC records, and more recently, in late 2023, performed some political strategy consulting for the Harris campaign. But the Harris campaign's payments to Chong and Koster dried up in December 2023. The following month, in January 2024, Harris campaign dollars started flowing into the newly formed Dupont Circle Strategies by the millions for ad production and placement, FEC records show. And it just so happens that Chong and Koster and Dupont Circle Strategies share the same office suite in a building in downtown Washington, D.C., according to Harris campaign payment records. Dupont Circle Strategies could not be reached for comment. Chong and Koster did not return requests for comments asking about its connection to Dupont Circle Strategies.

Israel approves billions in military upgrades	The Defense Ministry will purchase five 'Reshef' ships from Israel Shipyards to replace the 'Nirit' Sa’ar 4.5-class missile ship, which will be decommissioned after four decades of service. By JNS The Israel Military Procurement Ministerial Committee on Sunday approved billions of shekels in acquisitions, including the Israeli Navy’s next-generation 'Reshef' missile ships and hundreds of new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV). According to a joint statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, Defense Ministry and Finance Ministry spokesperson, the approvals follow interim recommendations by the 'Nagel Committee,' which was established in August 2024 to examine the defense budget and force buildup. Under the agreement, the Defense Ministry will purchase five 'Reshef' ships from Israel Shipyards to replace the 'Nirit' Sa’ar 4.5-class missile ship, which will be decommissioned after four decades of service. According to the announcement, the domestic production of the new vessels will employ hundreds of workers. Additionally, hundreds of new JLTV armored combat mobility vehicles are to be supplied to the Israel Defense Forces in the coming years. The Nagel Committee was tasked with making recommendations on Israel’s defense budget and long-term defense planning in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks and the ongoing multi-front war it sparked. The approved projects will now be submitted to the Knesset’s Joint Committee for the Defense Budget. After receiving its approval, the Defense Ministry will proceed with finalizing the procurements.

Britain hints it would arrest Netanyahu if he visits UK	British Foreign Secretary David Lammy says UK ‘committed’ to ICC treaty and will adhere to its ‘obligations under international law’ if Israeli prime minister visits. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Britain’s foreign minister hinted Monday that the UK would arrested Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud) if they visited Britain, in keeping with the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court at The Hague. Foreign Secretary David Lammy (Labour) fielded questions from reporters at the G7 summit in Italy, including queries regarding how Britain would respond to calls by the ICC to arrest Netanyahu or Gallant, should either visit the United Kingdom Lammy emphasized that Britain is a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, adding that should Netanyahu or Gallant visit Britain, 'there would be a court process.' 'We are signatories to the Rome Statute; we have always been committed to our obligations under international law and international humanitarian law,' Lammy told reporters at a G7 meeting in Italy. 'Of course, if there were to be such a visit to the UK, there would be a court process, and due process would be followed in relation to those issues.' Prior to Lammy’s comments, the Keir Starmer government had refused to clearly state whether it would adhere to the ICC ruling. Last Thursday, following the ICC’s decision to issue the arrest warrants, the prime minister’s office said that it viewed the ICC as 'the primary international institution for investigating and prosecuting the most serious crimes of international concern.' Starmer’s spokesperson backed Israel’s right to defend itself and rejected attempts to draw a moral equivalency between Israel and Hamas or Hezbollah, but did not take a clear stand on enforcement of the ICC arrest warrants. 'This Government has been clear that Israel has a right to defend itself in accordance with international law,' spokesman continued. 'There is no moral equivalence between Israel, a democracy, and Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, which are terrorist organizations.' 'We remain focused on pushing for an immediate ceasefire to bring an end to the devastating violence in Gaza which is essential to protect civilians, ensure the release of hostages, and to increase humanitarian aid into Gaza.'

Suspects arrested in connection with UAE rabbi’s murder identifie...	United Arab Emirates reveals the identities of three men, all Uzbeki nationals, arrested on suspicion of abducting and murdering Rabbi Zvi Kogan. By World Israel News Staff The United Arab Emirates on Monday identified the three suspects arrested in connection with the abduction and murder of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi. On Monday, the UAE’s interior ministry cleared for publication the identities of three men, all Uzbek nationals, who were recently taken into custody on suspicion of killing 28-year-old Rabbi Zvi Kogan, an aide to the chief rabbi of the UAE and proprietor of a kosher grocery store in Abu Dhabi. The three Uzbek suspects include 28-year-old Olimpi Toirovich, Makhmudjon Abdurakhim, 28, and Azizbek Kamlovich, 33. Photographs of the three with their faces partially covered were also released. 'The Ministry of Interior announced that the competent security authorities have begun initial investigations with the three suspects arrested for committing the murder of Moldovan resident Zvi Kogan, in preparation for referring them to the Public Prosecution for further investigations,' the UAE interior ministry said. The statement by the UAE interior ministry did not mention that Rabbi Kogan also held Israeli citizenship and had served in the IDF. 'The ministry emphasized the commitment of the security authorities to swiftly take the necessary measures to uncover the details, circumstances, and motives of the incident. It highlighted the dedication of their human, professional, and technical resources, which led to the swift arrest of the perpetrators.' 'The ministry praised the vigilance and quick action of the security apparatus, ensuring the identification, pursuit, and apprehension of the suspects in a short period. It also commended their efficiency in addressing attempts to undermine the safety and stability of the UAE community.' UAE officials have not disclosed any details regarding a suspected motive for the killing, nor whether the three suspects have been linked to Iran. While some have speculated that Iran may have been responsible for the abduction and murder, Tehran denied Sunday any involvement in the plot.

Ayatollah Khamenei: Netanyahu must die	Arresting Netanyahu and Gallant is not enough,' says Iran's supreme leader, calling for death penalty against Israeli premier and former Israeli defense minister, after ICC issues arrest warrants. By World Israel News Staff Iran's supreme leader called Monday for the execution of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, arguing that the International Criminal Court's decision last Thursday to issue arrest warrants for the two was insufficient. On Monday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the 85-year-old head of state and spiritual leader of Iran, addressed a gathering of the Basij Resistance Force, a paramilitary force within Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran's Tasnim News Agency reported. During his speech, Khamenei accused Israeli leaders of 'war crimes' in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, referring to Israel's ongoing wars against the Hamas and Hezbollah terror organizations. Responding to the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants, Khamenei lamented that arresting Netanyahu and Gallant 'is not enough.' 'Netanyahu's death sentence must be issued. The death sentence of these criminal leaders should be issued.' 'The crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon, Gaza and Palestine are the opposite of what they want to create; That is, it strengthens and intensifies the resistance. This is a general rule, there is no going back.' Khamenei mocked the ongoing air campaigns against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon and Hamas terror cells in Gaza, saying such strikes did not constitute 'victory.' 'Idiots should not think that bombing homes, hospitals, and people's gatherings is a sign of their victory. No one in the world considers this a victory.' 'A zealous Palestinian and Lebanese youth of any class, when he sees whether he is on the battlefield or not, he is exposed to bombardment and the risk of death. Struggle and resistance are not left for themselves; So the criminal idiots are actually developing the resistance front by their own hands.'

Hezbollah rocket wounds one in Nahariya	On Sunday, Israel marked one of the most intense days of rocket fire from Lebanon since the start of the war. By JNS Lebanon’s Hezbollah terrorist group launched over 20 rockets at the upper and western Galilee regions on Monday morning, lightly wounding a 75-year-old man in Nahariya. He was evacuated to the city’s Galilee Medical Center for further treatment, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency medical service. Shortly after the 20-rocket barrage on the western Galilee, sirens sounded in Avivim and Kiryat Shmona in the Upper Galilee. About an hour later, alerts sounded in the Western Galilee, with the IDF reporting that one UAV, which had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli airspace, had been intercepted by the Israeli Air Force. The military clarified that sirens were activated due to the threat of falling shrapnel from the interception. document.createElement('video'); On Sunday, Israel marked one of the most intense days of rocket fire from Lebanon since the start of the war. According to Hebrew media, some 250 rockets triggered 543 sirens in central and northern Israel throughout the day, a record topped only on the day Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was killed. Eight people were wounded, property was damaged and more than a million Israelis ran for shelter throughout the day. Overnight Sunday, the Israeli Air Force struck rocket launchers from which the Haifa area and the Sharon district in central Israel were targeted, as well as 12 Hezbollah command posts in its Dahieh stronghold south of Beirut, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Hezbollah has launched some 16,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel since joining the war in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the Gaza-based terror organization’s massacre in southern Israel. More than 60,000 residents of northern Israel remain internally displaced due to the ongoing cross-border attacks from Lebanon, which to date have killed 76 people in Israel, including 31 IDF soldiers and six foreign nationals, and wounded 729 more, 66 of them seriously.

Dershowitz gathering ‘dream team’ to defend Netanyahu and Gallant...	The arrest warrant for war crimes 'disgraces the rule of international law,' the famed jurist wrote in the Wall Street Journal. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Harvard law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz is gathering a 'dream team' to defend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant from war crimes charges that will be brought against them at the International Criminal Court (ICC), he wrote Sunday in The Wall Street Journal. The case is extremely important, he noted, because 'It will also be tried in the court of public opinion, both in the U.S. and throughout the world.' He is therefore 'assembling a team of world class lawyers from around the globe to help defend Israeli leaders against the false charges.' He named over a dozen prominent attorneys who have already agreed to join him. These included former U.S. attorneys-general Michael Mukasey and William Barr, former FBI Director Louis Freeh, former Canadian minister of justice and attorney general Irwin Cotler, and Nadine Strossen, the former president of the American Civil Liberties Union. The ICC on Thursday issued arrest warrants for the two Israeli leaders and a Hamas terrorist, Muhammed Deif, who was assassinated by the IDF months ago but the court is ostensibly not convinced of his death. By doing so, Dershowitz argued, 'the court is seeking to equate the terrorism of Hamas, which murdered, raped and kidnapped approximately 1,450 Israelis, mostly civilians, with the self-defense efforts of Israel to prevent a promised recurrence of Oct. 7.' He accused the court of creating a 'double standard' for Israel’s prosecution of its war of self-defense against the terrorists, when 'the validity, integrity, legitimacy and acceptability of international law and the laws of war depend on the application of a single standard.' By issuing 'these illegal and unjustified warrants,' he wrote, the ICC has 'disgraced and destroyed' the rule of international law and 'lost its credibility.' Dershowitz applauded the announcements by Congressional leaders that they would sanction ICC personnel if they continue with their anti-Israel efforts. The arguments he said the team would use are familiar ones that Israel and its allies have already raised in attempts to head off legal action against the Jewish state by both the ICC and the International Court of Justice, whose mandate is to settle legal disputes on a state level and does not deal with individuals. These include complementarity, which means that if a country has a judicial system as Israel does, that readily and robustly investigates even political leaders, the ICC cannot try the case itself. They will also delve into hard statistics that have seemingly been ignored in the court’s zeal to prosecute. Dershowitz wrote of the fact that the IDF’s kill ratio between combatants and noncombatants in Gaza is 'lower than in any comparable war anywhere in the world.' This makes a mockery of the charge that Israel is attempting to commit genocide 'or any other war crime.' The team will also present as an argument the enormous amount of humanitarian aid – 700,000 tons of food and medicine, according to government sources – that Israel has allowed into Gaza over the last year. The professor emeritus at Harvard Law School ended by inviting other like-minded legal eagles to 'join in this endeavor.'

Paranoia grips Hezbollah as hundreds of members are charged with ...	They've been targeting an international mix of suspects, including Lebanese citizens, multiple Western passport holders, and dozens of Syrian nationals. By Jewish Breaking News With Israel knocking out Hezbollah’s top leaders, paranoia has overtaken the Iranian-backed terror group, resulting in a sweeping purge that has seen more than 200 people detained on trumped-up espionage charges. According to Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar newspaper, since early September, Hezbollah’s security apparatus has unleashed a sweeping crackdown in its Beirut stronghold of Dahieh. They've been targeting an international mix of suspects, including Lebanese citizens, multiple Western passport holders, and dozens of Syrian nationals. In one notable case, authorities detained a former American law enforcement officer who was discovered touring the area with a local Lebanese contact. During interrogation, the ex-cop maintained he was simply documenting conditions in the war-affected region. Similarly, a French national who presented himself as a member of the press found himself in custody after Hezbollah uncovered what they deemed suspicious footage of Dahieh buildings on his mobile device. Hezbollah’s crackdown has fallen particularly heavily on Syrian nationals, with more than 50 detained thus far. Intelligence sources claim many of these individuals leveraged dual citizenship status to enter Beirut, allegedly using their foreign passports as cover while gathering photographic intelligence. State security maintains these suspects have documented connections to Syrian opposition forces, though no evidence has been publicly presented. Beyond espionage, Hezbollah has taken a page from Russia’s playbook by charging suspects with additional crimes like drug dealing and theft.

Israel hits 12 Hezbollah command centers in Beirut	Hezbollah escalated its rocket attacks on Israel on Sunday, with some 250 rockets triggering more than 540 alarms across northern and central Israel, wounding at least eight people and damaging several structures. By Joshua Marks, JNS The Israeli Air Force struck a dozen Hezbollah command centers in the Iranian terror proxy’s stronghold in Dahieh south of Beirut on Sunday night, according to the military. Targets included operations hubs of Hezbollah’s intelligence unit, coast-to-sea missile unit and Unit 4400, which is responsible for the terrorist group’s weapons smuggling into Lebanon from Iran via Syria. 'These command centers had been used by Hezbollah to plan, command, and execute terrorist attacks against the State of Israel and to monitor terrorist activity against IDF troops operating in southern Lebanon,' the Israel Defense Forces said. 12 Hezbollah command centers were struck by the IAF in Dahieh, Beirut, including sites used by Hezbollah's Intelligence Unit, coast-to-sea missile unit, and Unit 4400—responsible for smuggling weapons from Iran through Syria into Lebanon.

On Monday morning, the IDF reported that troops had uncovered significant stockpiles of weaponry and dismantled numerous armed launchers aimed at communities in the Galilee region.

Additionally, Israeli airstrikes struck dozens of Hezbollah positions across southern and central Lebanon, including command centers and weapons storage facilities. Escalation may continue as ceasefire deal gets closer Israeli officials predict that as ceasefire negotiations with Lebanon advance, the intensity of Hezbollah’s rocket fire will likely escalate. Sources in Jerusalem told Channel 12 News: 'We are navigating a complex situation, but it should not be assessed based solely on today’s attacks. We expected that the closer we get [to an agreement], the more launches we would face, with Hezbollah intensifying its assaults—particularly in response to our operations in Lebanon.

(Twitter Screenshot) Hebrew media reported Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a consultation on Sunday night with Defense Minister Israel Katz and other senior security officials to discuss the Lebanon ceasefire efforts. 'We are close to an agreement. It could happen within days; a few details remain to be finalized,' Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Herzog told Israel’s Army Radio on Monday morning. Among the remaining gaps between the sides is Jerusalem’s demand that the IDF maintain freedom of action in Lebanon should Hezbollah violate the terms of the ceasefire by rearming itself and attempting to reestablish forces south of the Litani River. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Dan Shapiro was expected to arrive in the Jewish state on Monday to meet with Katz and other senior officials. A central item on the agenda will be addressing Israeli concerns regarding immediate operational cooperation and safeguarding the military’s freedom of action. Shapiro’s visit to Israel follows that of U.S. presidential envoy Amos Hochstein last week and Gen. Erik Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), over the weekend. Negotiators are working out the framework for an international enforcement mechanism to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish itself in Southern Lebanon. Recent diplomatic efforts have aimed at minimizing situations where Israel will violate Lebanese sovereignty in response to a breach of the agreement. The goal is to empower the international monitoring mechanism as much as possible, while establishing clear criteria for when Israel can exercise its military freedom of action. Kurilla met with IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi on Saturday to discuss the proposed U.S. monitoring mechanism for Lebanese army operations. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) head Gen. Erik Kurilla meets in Israel with IDF Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Herzi Halevi, June 2024. (Credit: IDF.) Under the developing draft agreement, the Lebanese army will be required to conduct a comprehensive operation to remove weapons from villages in Southern Lebanon, with CENTCOM forces overseeing strict enforcement of this process. One unresolved issue is whether France will be involved in the oversight mechanism, according to Kan News. Beirut supports Paris participating, while Jerusalem opposes it. However, Kan reported that estimates in Israel are that a compromise will be reached on this matter. Another potential obstacle is that, according to a report in Channel 12, Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, must grant final approval for any ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel. Meanwhile, Halevi has instructed IDF General Staff directorates to continue developing and finalizing comprehensive operational plans. These plans are intended to address both the potential failure of negotiations and possible breaches of the agreement by Hezbollah—scenarios that could necessitate military action in Lebanese territory.

Rabbi’s murder was a ‘crime against the UAE,’ says Emirati ambass...	UAE's ambassador to the US denounces killing of Israeli-Moldovan rabbi who had served as emissary in Abu Dhabi, calling his murder a 'crime against the UAE.' By World Israel News Staff The United Arab Emirates on Sunday condemned the abduction and murder of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi last week, calling it a 'crime against the UAE.' Last Thursday, 28-year-old Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan, who served as an aide to the chief rabbi of the UAE and operated a kosher grocery shop in Abu Dhabi, was declared missing. Over the weekend, his body was found by UAE security personnel. According to a preliminary investigation, Kogan was abducted by three Uzbek nationals working on behalf of Iran before being murdered. 'Today the UAE mourns for Rabbi Zvi Kogan,' Emirati Ambassador to the United States Yousef Al-Otaiba said in a statement Sunday night. 'Our thoughts are with his family, friends and community over his senseless death. Zvi Kogan’s murder was more than a crime in the UAE - it was a crime against the UAE. It was an attack on our homeland, on our values and on our vision.' 'In the UAE, we welcome everyone. We embrace peaceful coexistence. We reject extremism and fanaticism of every kind. We honor Zvi Kogan’s memory by recommitting ourselves to these values.' 'Now, we are more determined than ever to protecting and sustaining the Emirates as a shining and enduring example of diversity, acceptance and peace.' The UAE is one of six Arab states with formal diplomatic ties to Israel, becoming the first of four countries to join the Abraham Accords with Israel in 2020. Also on Sunday, the UAE interior ministry announced that authorities had apprehended the three suspects wanted in connection with the murder of Rabbi Kogan. The ministry boasted that police had carried out the arrest 'in record time.'

El Al reports $1 billion in revenue, as foreign carriers avoid Is...	El Al raked in $1 billion in three-month period, while foreign airlines refrain from stating when they'll resume Israeli routes. By World Israel News Staff Israeli airline El Al recorded its highest-ever revenue and a major increase in its profits, as dozens of foreign airlines cancel routes to Israel, with no estimate of when they'll return. El Al recently announced that its third-quarter revenues reached $1 billion, a 44 percent increase from the same period in 2023. The carrier's net profits soared to $185 million, marking an increase of a staggering 258 percent. 'El Al has been operating in emergency mode for more than a year, and our goal is to ensure that the skies remain open between Israel and the world,' El Al CEO Dina Ben Tal Ganancia said in a media statement. 'Throughout the months of the war and especially in the current quarter, we continue to experience increased demand for El Al flights, which is significantly higher in relation to the seat capacity that the company is able to offer.' In recent months, El Al has faced serious criticism for price gouging, as the carrier is one of just a handful that continues to provide routes to and from the Jewish State during the ongoing war. Many foreign airlines have declined to state when they expect to resume their Israeli fights. Ganancia appeared to acknowledge that much of the company's record profits are due to the fact that the carrier essentially has a monopoly on flights to Israel. She stressed that El Al was pushed to the limit by the demand for flights, and urged foreign carriers to return to Israel in order to provide more options for those wishing to travel to and from the country. 'We make every operational effort to increase the supply of seats as much as possible, in order to find solutions and serve the public traveling from and to Israel, but for the moment we don’t have any substantial capacity to add additional flights and therefore everything needs to done for foreign airlines to resume their operations to Israel,' she said. 'Otherwise passenger demand will not stabilize and the problem will only get worse,' she added.

Israel signals agreement to ceasefire proposal in Lebanon	Multiple reports indicate Jerusalem has signaled its approval of an American-backed truce between Israel and Hezbollah, accepting the core provisions of the draft deal. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli government has given preliminary approval to an American-backed ceasefire proposal to end the fighting in Lebanon, multiple Hebrew-language media outlets reported overnight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held multiple meetings with senior officials Sunday, and according to reports by Ha'aretz, Yedioth Aharanoth, and Kan, has agreed in principle with the ceasefire proposal presented last week by Biden administration special envoy to the Middle East Amos Hochstein. Hochstein visited Israel last week and met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, following his trip to Beirut, where he met with Lebanese leaders, including Speaker of the Lebanese parliament Nabih Berri. A leader of the Shi'ite movement Amal, Berri has served as an interlocutor for talks between the U.S. and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist organization. Following Hochstein's visit to Lebanon last week, Hezbollah secretary-general Naim Qassem said that Hezbollah had reviewed the proposed ceasefire, issued its response to Hochstein, and that the matter was now up to Israel. Hochstein reportedly pressed top Israeli officials over the weekend, warning them that this marks the administration's final attempt to broker a ceasefire, and that a rejection by Jerusalem would end efforts by the Biden White House to bring the two sides to a deal. Netanyahu has reportedly agreed in principle to the ceasefire deal, and is now mulling how to present the decision to the Israeli public. While the ceasefire deal has yet to be finalized and some key sticking points remain, it would reportedly include three major provisions, and would be implemented in three stages. According to reports last week, under the American proposal, Hezbollah would be required to withdraw its forces away from the Israeli border and north of the Litani River, with the terrorist group also obligated to disarm, in keeping with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Secondly, a U.S.-led committee would be tasked with ensuring compliance with the ceasefire. Finally, Israel would retain the right to respond militarily in Lebanon to violations of the ceasefire, but only after the committee exhausts other avenues for restoring the peace. In the first stage of the deal, a ceasefire would be imposed during which Hezbollah would withdraw from the southern bank of the Litani River. Afterwards, Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanese territory. In the third and final stage, Israel and Lebanon would enter into talks regarding contested border areas.

Iran ‘immediately’ accelerating nuclear program to ‘punish’ IAEA	We will significantly increase our uranium enrichment capacity,' says spokesman for Iran's nuclear development program. By World Israel News Staff Iran announced that it is 'immediately' activating advanced centrifuges for uranium enrichment, as a punitive measure after an international nuclear watchdog group criticized Tehran for refusing to cooperate with an oversight program. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently passed a resolution urging Iran to be more transparent in regards to its nuclear development program, calling on the country to allow IAEA inspectors to visit and monitor its nuclear sites. That resolution sparked outrage among Iran's senior leadership, who released a statement indicating that it would ramp up nuclear development as an act of defiance against the IAEA. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran's reciprocal response to this political misuse of the [IAEA] Board of Governors was immediately put into action, and the deployment of a set of new and advanced centrifuges has begun,' Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf told Iran International. Ghalibaf described the resolution as 'anti-Iran' and 'harmful,' and claimed that it was an 'unjust' decision against Iran's 'peaceful' nuclear program. 'We will significantly increase our enrichment capacity, deploy various advanced machines, and enhance the speed of industrial research and development for each machine,' Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said in a Farsi-language TV interview. 'Our infrastructure will be strengthened, and security measures will be improved through other actions,' he added. Despite Iran's decision to ramp up its nuclear program rather than allow international inspectors at its site, some countries are still urging Tehran to return to the negotiation table, with the goal of returning to the 2015 nuclear deal. 'We note with serious concern Iran's announcement&#8230; that, instead of responding to the resolution with cooperation, it plans to respond with further expansion of its nuclear program in ways that have no credible peaceful rationale,' the United States, Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement released by the U.S. State Department. 'We expect Iran to reengage on the path of dialogue and cooperation with the agency.'

‘Murdered simply for being Jewish’: Outraged Israelis grieve murd...	According to Israeli media reports, the killers are thought to be Uzbek nationals working on behalf of Iran who fled to Turkey. By Noah Michaeli, TPS Israelis reacted with outrage and grief in reaction to the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan in the United Arab Emirates. Emirati authorities found his body on Sunday after he disappeared on Thursday. 'Antisemitism is not just a thing of the past. Hatred of Israel is a plague that is rampant around the world today,' said Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar in response to the murder. 'I mourn with sorrow and outrage the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan,' tweeted President Isaac Herzog. 'This vile antisemitic attack is a reminder of the inhumanity of the enemies of the Jewish people,' Herzog noted, adding that the murder 'will not deter us from continuing to grow flourishing communities in the UAE or anywhere – especially with the help of the dedicated commitment and work of the Chabad emissaries all over the world.' According to Israeli media reports, the killers are thought to be Uzbek nationals working on behalf of Iran who fled to Turkey. Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli blamed Iran. 'The horrific murder of Chabad emissary Zvi Kogan, may his blood be avenged, is a criminal, antisemitic terrorist act for which the terrorist state of Iran is responsible. It is our duty to overthrow this regime, the root of evil in the Middle East,' Chikli said. Dr. Yoel Guzansky, Head of the Gulf Program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), criticized the United Arab Emirates for its reluctance to refer to the event as an antisemitic terror attack or blame Iran. 'The UAE government seeks to downplay the murder of the Chabad emissary,' Guzansky said. 'They are not rushing to blame Iran due to the improving relations between the two countries.' A statement by the Emirati Foreign Ministry released on Saturday only referred to Kogan as a 'missing Moldovan citizen.' It made no reference to Kogan’s Israeli nationality, nor did it identify him as a rabbi. 'This incident damages their image and could harm tourism from Israel,' Guzansky added. Amid a major spike in attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets worldwide since Hamas’s October 7 massacres, Israel has issued travel warnings for countries across the Middle East.

The suspects, aged 22 and 35, were pulled over by officers on Friday in the area of the Megiddo Junction, located a mere minutes’ drive away from the Samaria security barrier.

Israeli gov’t severs ties with paper over publisher’s controversi...	The controversy erupted when the paper’s publisher, Amos Schocken, described Palestinian terrorists as 'freedom fighters' while addressing a Haaretz conference in London on Oct. 27. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli government is severing ties with the Haaretz daily over the publisher’s controversial remarks about Palestinian terrorists, Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi announced on Sunday. 'We will not allow a reality in which the publisher of an official newspaper in the State of Israel will call for the imposition of sanctions against it and will support the enemies of the state in the midst of a war and will be financed by it,' Karhi said. 'We advocate a free press and freedom of expression, but also the freedom of the government to decide not to fund incitement against the State of Israel,' he added. The measure means the government will 'sever any advertising relationship with the newspaper Haaretz and calls on all its branches, ministries and bodies, as well as any government corporation or body funded by it not to have contact with the Haaretz newspaper in any form and not to publish any publications in it.' The controversy erupted when the paper’s publisher, Amos Schocken, described Palestinian terrorists as 'freedom fighters' while addressing a Haaretz conference in London on Oct. 27. 'The [Benjamin] Netanyahu government doesn’t care about imposing a cruel apartheid regime on the Palestinian population. It dismisses the costs to both sides for defending the [West Bank] settlements while fighting the Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls terrorists.' Schocken later issued a clarification, saying he should have expressed himself differently. 'As for Hamas, they are not freedom fighters,' Schocken wrote. Haaretz‘s editorial board distanced itself from the publisher’s remarks. The left-wing daily often publishes content critical of the Israeli government’s policies towards the Palestinians. The Schocken family has controlled Haaretz since 1937 when Salman Schocken, a German-Jewish publisher and businessman, acquired the newspaper. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

‘None of them will get away’ – Netanyahu vows Israel will ‘deal’ ...	Israel's prime minister vows to 'deal with' murderers of Rabbi Zvi Kogan - as well as 'those who dispatched them,' in a veiled threat against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Sunday that Israel would bring the killers of a rabbi serving in the United Arab Emirates to justice - as well as their handlers, in a veiled threat to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. On Sunday, the Prime Minister's Office and Israel's Foreign Ministry issued a joint statement announcing that authorities in the UAE had found the body of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a 41-year-old Israeli-Moldovan dual citizen who had been serving as a Chabad emissary in Abu Dhabi, where he ran a kosher grocery store. At the weekly government meeting Sunday, Netanyahu expressed 'deep outrage' over the killing, which he described as 'an abhorrent antisemitic terrorist attack.' During the meeting, Netanyahu offered his 'heartfelt condolences to the Kogan family,' while pledging that Israel would bring the murderers to justice - along with 'those who dispatched them,' hinting at a possible reprisal against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. 'On your behalf, I also send heartfelt condolences to the Kogan family. The State of Israel will use all means, and will deal with these murderers, and those who dispatched them, to the fullest extent of the law. None of them will get away.' The prime minister also addressed claims by Hamas that a female hostage was recently killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza. Netanyahu emphasized that Israel is 'checking the information,' while adding that 'at this stage' it 'cannot be verified.' Reiterating previous statements, Netanyahu offered $5 million in cash, along with promises of safe passage, to any Gazan who frees an Israeli hostage, while vowing that any terrorists who harm hostages 'will pay the price.' 'Whoever dares to harm the lives of our hostages – will pay the price. I also said and I repeat: Whoever brings a hostage alive out of Gaza will receive $5 million; others who bring valuable information will also be compensated.' 'I appeal to the residents of Gaza: You can choose life and ensure your future and that of your families, or you can cling to death and destruction. The choice is yours; choose life.'

By World Israel News Staff At least nine people were injured Sunday, including one victim in serious condition, when Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon fired roughly 160 rockets and missiles at northern and central Israel during two waves of major attacks by the Iranian-backed terror group Sunday. The latest wave of rocket attacks began at just before 1:00 p.m. Sunday, with warning sirens sounded in cities and towns across central Israel including Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak, Petah Tikva, Rosh Ha'ayin, Hod HaSharon, Ramat Gan, Givat Shmuel, Elad, Kfar Qassem, Ramat HaSharon, Ra'anana, and Kfar Saba. Sirens were sounded minutes later in northern Israel, including in and around Haifa, Nahariya, Kiryat Shmona, Meron, Kfar Blum, and Maalot. Hezbollah rockets were also launched Sunday morning at towns in northern and central Israel. In total, at least nine people were injured in the rocket attacks Sunday, including a 51-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man injured in a rocket attack on the northern town of Maalot Tarshiha Sunday morning. United Hatzalah and Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency first responders were called to the scene in Maalot Tarshiha to treat the victims and evacuate them to local hospitals. The female victim was lightly wounded by shrapnel from a rocket, United Hatzalah reported, while the male victim suffered a moderate head injury while rushing to a bomb shelter. At just before 1:00 p.m., four people were injured when a rocket struck the central Israeli city of Petah Tikva. One of the victims, a 70-year-old woman, is listed in moderate condition after she suffered from smoke inhalation from the rocket impact. In addition, a 20 year old man suffered mild injuries from the blast of the rocket impact, while United Hatzalah emergency first responders Doron Shafir and Shlomo Feder treated a man and a woman in their 60s who had been wounded by shrapnel from the rocket. A man roughly 60 years of age was seriously wounded from shrapnel after a rocket struck in the northern town of Kfar Blum at approximately 2:00 p.m., while two others were injured in a rocket strike on the northern coastal city of Haifa.

Israelis urged to cancel trips to UAE, exercise caution in Thaila...	Israel's National Security Council issues new travel warnings for United Arab Emirates and Thailand, calling on Israelis to avoid the UAE if possible, and to exercise caution when traveling to Thailand. By World Israel News Staff Israel's National Security Council is calling on Israeli travelers to cancel all non-essential trips to the United Arab Emirates, and advising travelers exercise caution when visiting Thailand. The NSC issued a pair of new travel warnings over the weekend, updating the travel advisory status for Israelis visiting Thailand and the UAE. While the NSC emphasized that the updated advisory guidelines for travel to Thailand were not based on any new concrete threats, the travel warning to the UAE was issued just days after Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a 41-year-old Chabad emissary with dual Moldovan and Israeli citizenship and assistant to the chief rabbi of the UAE, was reported missing. Rabbi Kogan's remains were found by UAE security personnel over the weekend, after he was abducted and murdered by agents working on behalf of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The UAE is now ranked as a level 3 risk for Israeli travelers, the NSC said, according to which Israelis are advised to cancel non-essential trips to the UAE. 'And for those who are in the country—take extra precautions,' the advisory alert reads, including the removal of any outward signs of Jewishness or Israeli citizenship. 'Remain extra vigilant, and pay attention to your surroundings; If you are concerned that you have been exposed to a terrorist incident, inform the security forces; In major cities, or locations where demonstrations or protests are taking place, conceal anything that could identify you as Israeli or Jewish.' Regarding travel to Thailand, the NSC urged Israelis visiting the country to avoid attending large events identified with Israel, and concealing their Jewish and Israeli identity.

US senator threatens sanctions on allies over arrest warrants for...	South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham puts Canada, Britain, and other US allies on notice that cooperation with ICC in efforts to arrest Israeli leaders will lead to harsh American sanctions. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff A senior United States senator warned American allies not to cooperate with the International Criminal Court at The Hague in its effort to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud), threatening to impose sanctions on states which honor the arrest warrants. Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of two Republicans representing South Carolina, castigated the International Criminal Court Saturday over its decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant over their handling of the war against the Hamas terror organization, claiming there was sufficient evidence of violations of international law to justify their arrests. 'Israel is in a fight for its very life,' Graham told Fox News. 'The Jewish state is under siege from Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran has directly attacked Israel. And we live in an upside-down world where the prime minister of Israel and the defense minister of Israel are being prosecuted by a court in Belgium.' Graham also ripped the court on technical grounds, both for granting state standing to the Gaza Strip and for taking action against a state, Israel, which is not a party to the Rome Statue of the ICC. 'The court ruled that Gaza is a state – no, there is no Palestinian state under international law. And Israel is not a member of the International Criminal Court, and neither are we.' 'This is an antisemitic body and this court is to literally put in jail the prime minister of Israel and the defense minister for [Israel] defending itself from multiple terrorist organizations.' The senator warned American allies, including Canada and Britain, that any attempt to enforce the ICC arrest warrants would prompt the U.S. to impose sanctions which would 'crush' their economies. 'If you are going to help the ICC, as a nation, enforce their arrest warrant against Bibi and Gallant…I will put sanctions on you as a nation. You are going to have to pick either the rogue ICC versus America.' 'I’m working with Tom Cotton to have legislation passed as soon as we can to sanction any country that aides and abets the arrest of any politician in Israel.' 'To any ally: Canada, Britain, Germany, France – if you try to help the ICC, we’re gonna sanction you.' 'We should crush your economy because we’re next. Why can’t they go after Trump or any other American president under this theory?' On Thursday, Graham took to X to respond to the ICC ruling, calling the decision to issue the arrest warrants 'rogue and politically motivated.' 'I cannot emphasize enough my strong objection to what the ICC has done to the State of Israel.' 'The ICC is a rogue and politically motivated organization that is trampling on the very concept of the rule of law. I made it abundantly clear that I believe this entire process is an abuse of the Rome Statute.' 'I am confident that President Trump understands that the Court’s actions against Israel sets the foundation for the ICC to come after the United States one day. We must respond forcefully to the Court for our own good.' 'Any nation or organization that aids or abets this outrage should expect to meet firm resistance from the United States, and I look forward to working with President Trump, his team, and my colleagues in Congress to come up with a powerful response.'

Hezbollah’s war costs Israel’s north 5 billion shekels and counti...	Meanwhile, business closures and agricultural destruction have cost a crippling 4 billion shekels. By Jewish Breaking News 'Once-bustling streets in northern Israel now sit empty, farms lie fallow, and thousands of displaced families wonder if they’ll ever return home. After thirteen months of relentless attacks by Hezbollah, this formerly prosperous region has been brought to its knees – to the tune of 5 billion shekels ($1.35 billion). According to Israel’s Tax Authority, direct property damage alone has reached 1.5 billion shekels due to the thousands of missiles and rockets that have destroyed hundreds of homes, schools, and community centers across Israel’s northern frontier. Meanwhile, business closures and agricultural destruction have cost a crippling 4 billion shekels. Although Israeli communities along the Lebanese border bear the brunt of Hezbollah’s attacks, the financial bleeding has spread nationwide. A single Hezbollah missile strike in central Israel’s Hod HaSharon damaged 2,000 apartments, and another strike in northern Tel Aviv last week caused damage estimated at 50 million shekels. The government’s compensation fund is struggling to keep pace. They’ve already paid out 2 billion shekels to desperate business owners and displaced families, with another 2 billion on deck for the coming months. Iran’s October missile barrage alone triggered 2,500 claims worth 150 million shekels, including damage to an Air Force base. However, while the IDF pours billions into defending itself, the human toll of Hezbollah’s rain of missiles cuts much deeper than any balance sheet – forcing Jewish families to abandon homes their grandparents built, leaving ghost towns where vibrant communities once stood.

Israel strikes Hezbollah assets at Syria-Lebanon crossing	The Israeli Air Force struck the crossing last month and has conducted several other attacks on the Syrian-Lebanese border in recent months in an attempt to prevent Hezbollah from rearming. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Sunday morning that it had conducted airstrikes in Syria overnight near a border crossing with Lebanon used by the Hezbollah terrorist group to smuggle weapons. Israeli warplanes attacked terrorist infrastructure adjacent to the Jousieh border crossing in Lebanon’s northern Beqaa area, which is under the control of the Syrian regime and operated by Syrian security forces. מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר, בהכוונת אגף המודיעין, תקפו אמש, באופן ממוקד, תשתיות צבאיות סמוכות למעבר הגבול ג׳וסיה שבצפון הבקעא. תשתיות אלו משמשות את ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה להעברת אמצעי לחימה מסוריה ללבנון >> pic.twitter.com/xRFm5lskms &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) November 24, 2024 Syria’s state-run SANA news agency reported on the strikes on Saturday night.

One in three Oct. 7 victims came to hospital in critical conditio...	The study by health policy researchers also emphasized the critical need to expand rehabilitation services in Israel. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A whopping one third of October 7 victims came to hospital in critical condition, said a study by health policy researchers revealed last week that examined the resources, or lack of them, that were exposed in Israel’s medical system following the day Hamas-led terrorists invaded the country. The study that was presented at a conference of the Israel National Institute for Health Policy Research (INIHPR) also noted that fully 70% of those rushed to hospital required at least one operation. The data showed that 630 people were hospitalized, with 90% of them bearing gunshot wounds, and 16% suffering from multiple types of injuries, including burns and blast wounds. The unprecedented number of serious casualties overwhelmed the two hospitals that were the initial intake centers on October 7, Soroka Hospital in Beer Sheva and Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon. The researchers said that their data showed that there is a critical need to upgrade infrastructure at Israeli hospitals in general, and add more operating rooms and imaging machines in particular to enable better and faster care of patients during mass casualty events. They also noted that fully half of all the injured were later transferred for rehabilitation and that the health care system must be revised and equipped to handle such numbers. 'The immense demand for rehabilitation resources in such a short timeframe necessitates rapid reorganization of existing medical facilities to accommodate the high number of patients requiring rehabilitation,' the researchers noted. There have been several reports over recent months on the response of the country’s medical system to the wounding of some 3,400 people on October 7 itself as well as the steadily climbing numbers due to the ongoing war in both the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. These included the issues covered in the study, both leveling criticism and providing recommendations for the future. For example, an August report by the Ministry of Defense stated that since October 7,2023, over 10,000 war wounded have been registered in the ministry’s Rehabilitation Division, with more than a thousand new cases coming in each month. Of them, more than a quarter are soldiers complaining of psychological issues such as anxiety and PTSD as a result of their war experiences. According to the forecast of the Rehabilitation Division, by the year 2030, 100,000 IDF disabled persons will be treated in the division, with half of them dealing with mental injuries. The ministry’s director general, Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Eyal Zamir, called these figures 'an unprecedented [struggle to] cope, on a scale we’ve never known before&#8230;. Our predictions, with an emphasis on those dealing with post-trauma, require the immediate mobilization of all state bodies and resources. The faster we react, the more wounded we will be able to return to life.' The study’s authors included Prof. Eldad Katorza, head of the Gertner Institute for Epidemiology and Health Policy Research, and Dr. Ari Lipsky, head of the emergency department at HaEmek Medical Center.

A Jewish museum in Tulsa held a funeral for remains of Holocaust ...	Thornblad said the museum was 'unable' to perform any DNA testing that might have revealed the identities of the remains, but said that they had originally come from the Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps. By Andrew Lapin, JTA For decades a museum of Jewish art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, held the remains of several unidentified Holocaust victims in its collection. But last week the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art took steps to give those remains a proper home, by burying and holding a Jewish funeral for them. 'We are committed to preserving history in a way that respects human dignity,' Sofia Thornblad, the museum’s chief curator, told local news organizations. 'This burial is a testament to our dedication to honoring the memories of Holocaust victims and educating future generations about the importance of remembrance and ethical stewardship.' The museum said the remains likely dated back to before the year 2000, when it was more common for museums to accept human remains into their collections. Shifting priorities in the museum space have led to a reexamination of such practices. The Tulsa museum also includes an extensive collection of Holocaust-era artifacts donated by Jewish Oklahomans, including refugees from Nazi Germany. Thornblad said the museum was 'unable' to perform any DNA testing that might have revealed the identities of the remains, but said that they had originally come from the Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps. (Jewish groups including Operation Benjamin have invested considerable resources as of late into identifying and reburying World War II-era Jewish remains.) The Tulsa museum isn’t the only one to have taken steps to bury remains of Holocaust victims in its collection. In 2019 the Rockland Holocaust Museum and Center for Tolerance and Education, in Rockland, New York, announced it would hold a proper Jewish funeral for the ashes of victims of the Chelmno death camp it had recently discovered in its collection. The ashes had been donated in 2006 by a Holocaust survivor who’d gathered dirt from the camp, apparently without realizing it held the ashes of others. The same year, the Imperial War Museum in London also announced it had the remains of several Jewish death camp victims in its collection and would be giving them a Jewish funeral. The remains of five adults and a child, all murdered at Auschwitz, were donated in 1997 by a private donor; the museum’s decision to bury them on English soil marked the first time that Holocaust victims had been laid to rest in the United Kingdom, according to Museums Journal. The question of what to do with human remains has vexed museums in recent years, particularly when it comes to Native American remains. Decades after passage of a law urging tribal remains to be returned to their descendants, many museums had yet to act on their own collections, according to a ProPublica investigation last year. Those present at the Tulsa funeral last Thursday, held at a Jewish cemetery, included local rabbis, an archaeologist, and local descendants of Holocaust survivors. Thornblad was among those who took turns shoveling dirt into the grave, in accordance with Jewish custom.

‘Plug and play’: COVID-19 nasal spray’s nanotech could target can...	Instead of the mRNA-based approach used by the Moderna and Pfize pharmaceutical companies, the researchers identified two key amino acid sequences in the virus’s protein, synthesized them, and encapsulated them in nanoparticles. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli and Portuguese scientists unveiled a novel COVID-19 vaccine that is not only effective against all major variants but can be administered as a nasal spray and — unlike conventional vaccines — stored at room temperature. Moreover, the nano-technology behind it could be adapted for other infectious diseases and other personalized treatments. The innovative vaccine is the brainchild of a collaboration between Prof. Ronit Satchi-Fainaro’s lab at Tel Aviv University and Prof. Helena Florindo’s team at the University of Lisbon. Published in the peer-reviewed Advanced Science journal, the scientists utilized synthesized nanoparticles to effectively target the virus without relying on traditional mRNA technology. The nano-vaccine leverages a unique 200-nanometer particle to train the immune system to combat COVID-19 variants, from Beta to Omicron, with effectiveness comparable to existing vaccines. Instead of the mRNA-based approach used by the Moderna and Pfize pharmaceutical companies, the researchers identified two key amino acid sequences in the virus’s protein, synthesized them, and encapsulated them in nanoparticles. 'Our approach was inspired by a decade of work on cancer vaccines. When COVID-19 emerged, we adapted our platform to develop a vaccine that is not only effective but also highly accessible,' said Satchi-Fainaro. The nano-vaccine offers two major advantages over existing options. First, as a nasal spray, it can be self-administered, eliminating the need for needles or trained healthcare personnel. Second, its storage and transportation requirements are minimal. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require ultra-cold storage because of the inherent instability of mRNA, the molecule at the heart of these vaccines. mRNA is a single-stranded nucleic acid that is highly fragile and susceptible to degradation by environmental factors. In contrast, the nano-vaccine can be stored as a powder at room temperature. For use, the powder is mixed with saline to create the spray. This feature was tested through the European Union’s ISIDORe feasibility program, where the vaccine powder was shipped at room temperature to France for testing. The results demonstrated efficacy on par with Pfizer’s vaccine. The nano-vaccine platform has potential beyond COVID-19. It could be adapted for other infectious diseases, personalized cancer treatments, and chronic conditions like autoimmune disorders, the researcher explained. 'Our technology is not just a solution for COVID-19; it is a platform for future vaccines,' said Prof. Satchi-Fainaro. 'This plug-and-play method allows rapid adaptation to target other infectious diseases or even cancer.'

Two wounded as Hezbollah fires salvos at northern, central Israel	Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were sent running to shelters by the attack, which occurred at approximately 7:30 a.m. By JNS A woman was injured in waves of rocket attacks by the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah targeting northern and central Israel on Sunday morning. 'MDA medics and paramedics are providing medical treatment and evacuating a 51-year-old woman in mild condition with a shrapnel injury to her lower limbs to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya,' the Magen David Adom emergency medical service said. She was wounded from a direct hit to a factory in Ma’alot that caused extensive damage during what the Israel Defense Forces said was a 30-rocket barrage at the Upper and Western Galilees, only some of which were intercepted. תיעוד מהנפילה הישירה במפעל במעלותהשימוש נעשה לפי סעיף 27א' לחוק זכויות יוצרים pic.twitter.com/G99rhWvPTw &mdash; ישראל היום (@IsraelHayomHeb) November 24, 2024 Additionally, a man around 60 years old in Ma’alot sustained moderate injuries while making his way to a shelter, according to Channel 12. Another barrage of 25 rockets was subsequently launched at the Upper Galilee, according to the IDF, with some of the projectiles intercepted and other impacts in open areas. Sirens also sounded three times in the evacuated border town of Metula during the morning hours. Earlier in the morning, the Iranian terror proxy launched six rockets at central Israel, according to the IDF. Five of the rockets were intercepted and one fell in open territory. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were sent running to shelters by the attack, which occurred at approximately 7:30 a.m. and triggered sirens in the Dan, Sharon and Menashe regions, including the seaside cities of Netanya and Herzliya north of Tel Aviv. No injuries were reported, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency rescue service. Shortly after the barrage on central Israel, red alerts were also heard in Kiryat Shmona and Margaliot near the border with Lebanon, as well as in Safed and the surrounding area. Israel’s Channel 12 news reported that two rockets had been fired at Safed, causing no injuries or damage. Shortly before the barrage on central Israel, several drones were launched from Lebanon into Israeli territory, setting off sirens in the Galilee. Two of the UAVs were intercepted, according to the IDF, which confirmed that the incident had ended. Hezbollah has launched some 16,000 rockets, missiles and drones from Lebanon at Israel since joining the war in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the Gaza-based terrorist group’s massacre in southern Israel. Over 60,000 residents of northern Israel remain internally displaced due to the ongoing rocket and drone attacks from Lebanon, which have caused widespread material damage and multiple deaths and injuries.

Missing Chabad rabbi found murdered	Abu Dhabi rabbi murdered after being abducted by pro-Iranian agents, says Israeli prime minister's office. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A Chabad rabbi serving as an emissary in Abu Dhabi has been found dead, days after he went missing, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office and Israeli Foreign Ministry announced in a joint statement Sunday morning. Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a 41-year-old dual citizen of Israel and Moldova, had been serving as an aide to Rabbi Levi Duchman, chief rabbi of the United Arab Emirates, and operated a kosher supermarket in Abu Dhabi, where he and his wife were residing. On Thursday, Rabbi Kogan went missing, leading to fears over the weekend that he had been abducted by operatives working on behalf of Iran. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) issued a statement claiming responsibility for the abduction. 'As part of the first stage of Operation 'Ensuring Truth 3,' and in fulfillment of their promise in response to Zionist aggression on Iranian lands and violations of Iranian sovereignty, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards have declared full responsibility for the abduction of the Israeli extremist Rabbi Tzvi Kogan.' Israel announced Sunday that Rabbi Kogan's body has been located by UAE authorities, stating that he had been murdered in an 'act of antisemitic terrorism.' 'The UAE intelligence and security authorities have located the body of Zvi Kogan, who has been missing since Thursday, 21 November 2024,' the Israeli Prime Minister's Office and Foreign Ministry said. 'The Israeli mission in Abu Dhabi has been in contact with the family from the start of the event and is continuing to assist it at this difficult time; his family in Israel has also been updated.' 'The murder of Zvi Kogan, of blessed memory, is an abhorrent act of antisemitic terrorism. The State of Israel will use all means and will deal with the criminals responsible for his death to the fullest extent of the law.' Initial reports indicate Rabbi Kogan was murdered after being abducted by three Uzbeki nationals working on behalf of Iran's IRGC. Israeli President Isaac Herzog eulogized Rabbi Kogan in a statement Sunday morning. 'I mourn with sorrow and outrage the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan. This vile antisemitic attack is a reminder of the inhumanity of the enemies of the Jewish people.' 'It will not deter us from continuing to grow flourishing communities in the UAE or anywhere - especially with the help of the dedicated commitment and work of the Chabad emissaries all over the world.' 'I thank the UAE authorities for their swift action, and trust they will work tirelessly to bring the perpetrators to justice. Our thoughts and condolences are with Rabbi Kogan’s wife and family. May his memory be a blessing.'

Netanyahu on leak case: ‘Shin Bet abusing suspects to punish me’	Premier says he is 'shaken' by the Shin Bet violating suspects' 'basic rights as citizens' in leak case. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Shin Bet security agency of engaging in a 'witch hunt' and the Israeli military of hiding 'critical' intelligence from him, in a fiery nine-minute-long video addressing the recent indictment filed against one of his aides. Eli Feldstein, an officer in the military reserves who worked as as an advisor to Netanyahu, reportedly brought a Hamas document to the premier's attention that had previously not been presented to the prime minister. The document, written by a mid-level Hamas member, outlined the terror organization's strategy of psychological warfare, including encouraging hostage protests in order to exacerbate divisions within Israeli society. After presenting the document to Netanyahu, Feldstein allegedly leaked its contents to a German newspaper. Several months later, he and a non-commissioned military officer, who has not been named publicly, were arrested by the Shin Bet. For more than one month, Feldstein has been held in isolation, and has been denied access to an attorney. He was recently moved to suicide watch, after a noose was said to have been discovered in his cell. Feldstein is being charged with leaking classified information in an attempt to harm state security. If convicted, he cold face a life sentence. 'This reality, in which young people are held like the worst terrorists, handcuffed for days, days in which they are prevented from accessing their lawyers, and violating their basic rights as citizens, shakes me,' Netanyahu said in the video statement, which was posted to his X account. Defending Feldstein, he described his former aide as a 'passionate Zionist and patriot,' adding that 'there is no chance in the world that he would intentionally do anything to harm state security.' Netanyahu questioned why the document regarding Hamas' strategy was never presented to him. 'Was this document supposed to be on my desk? Why didn’t it reach me? This isn’t the first time critical information hasn’t been delivered to me,' he said. The premier noted that there had been a number of high-profile leaks since the onset of the October 7th war, including those that had revealed sensitive details regarding Israel's military capabilities, but nobody was arrested or even questioned in those cases. 'It doesn’t take a genius to understand why there was no investigation into these leaks,' Netanyahu said. 'The public isn’t foolish. And now, we have a single investigation into one leak regarding a document that exposes Hamas's strategy to divide Israeli society and pressure me and the government to surrender to Hamas's will,' he added. 'The goal [of the indictment] is clear: to harm me and to harm you – the citizens of Israel who support me.'

Terror attack at Israeli embassy in Jordan, gunman killed	Attacker killed, 3 cops wounded as shooter targeted Israeli embassy in Amman. By World Israel News Staff A gunman targeting the Israeli embassy in Amman, Jordan was shot dead by security forces early Sunday morning, after he exchanged fire with police, wounding three officers. The attacker shot at the police as they engaged patrolled the Rabiah neighborhood, where the Israeli embassy is located and a frequent location for anti-Israel demonstrations. Earlier, gunshots had been heard near the embassy, causing local police to cordon off the area. It's believed that the perpetrator who fired the shots, likely aiming for the embassy, then attacked the police as they arrived to investigate. While Israel signed a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994, anti-Israel sentiment is widespread throughout the Hashemite Kingdom. Immediately following October 7th, Jordanians held numerous rallies with tens of thousands of celebrating the murderous Hamas rampage. Earlier in November, a former member of the Jordanian parliament was sentenced to 10 years in prison for smuggling weapons - presumably to terrorists for use in attacks against Israel - into Palestinian Authority-controlled territory. In October, two Jordanian terrorists wearing army uniforms infiltrated into Israel by breaching the border fence in the Dead Sea region. They opened fire in a moshav, wounding two people, before being shot dead by the community's emergency response team. In September, a Jordanian citizen killed three Israeli security guards at the Allenby Crossing, a checkpoint between Jordan and Palestinian Authority-controlled territory in Judea and Samaria. The day before the deadly attack, Jordanian Queen Rania railed against the Jewish State during a speech at a European economic conference. Accusing Israel of a 'criminal occupation' against the Palestinian people, Queen Rania claimed that the death toll in the ongoing Gaza war was indicative of Israel's inherent bias towards Palestinians. 'This devaluation of life must be called out for what it is: anti-Palestinian racism. This failure cannot stand,' she said.

EU official: Respect ICC warrants and arrest Netanyahu – or else	Borell stressed that countries which choose not to comply with the warrant could potentially face consequences. By World Israel News Staff Outgoing European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borell, a long-time critic of Israel, demanded that all EU member states act in accordance with recently-issued International Criminal Court arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'The states that signed the Rome convention are obliged to implement the decision of the court. It's not optional,' Borrell charged during a recent speech in Cyprus. Borrell appeared to be referring to statements from some European countries, including Germany, that they would not comply with the warrant and would refrain from arresting Netanyahu if he traveled to their nations. Hungarian President Victor Orban, a staunch supporter of Israel, recently invited Netanyahu to visit the country and pledged that the warrant would not be enforced on Hungary's soil. Terror group Hamas praised the decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, calling it an 'important step towards justice.' Borell stressed that countries which choose not to comply with the warrant could potentially face consequences. The EU diplomat continued to rail against the Jewish State, claiming that Israel uses claims of antisemitism to deflect legitimate criticism of its actions. 'Every time someone disagrees with the policy of one Israeli government [they are] accused of antisemitism. I have the right to criticize the decisions of the Israeli government, be it Mr. Netanyahu or someone else, without being accused of antisemitism. This is not acceptable. That's enough,' Borell said. Earlier in November, Borell urged the European Union to cut ties with Israel due to alleged human rights violations in the Gaza Strip. In March, Borell accused Israel of 'provoking famine' in the Gaza Strip, while calling the coastal enclave the world’s 'greatest open-air prison' and 'greatest open-air graveyard.'

Hamas claims female hostage killed during Gaza strike, IDF warns ...	The IDF later stated that it is 'currently assessing the information' and cannot 'confirm or deny its authenticity.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas claims that a female Israeli hostage was killed in a northern Gaza strike, the BBC reports. On Saturday, Abu Obeida Hamas's armed wing spokesman made the claim and said another female hostage was injured and in danger. He said, 'The danger still threatens the life of another female (prisoner) who was with her.' The IDF later stated that it is 'currently assessing the information' and cannot 'confirm or deny its authenticity.' 'IDF representatives are in contact with her family and providing them with any available information,' the statement continued. The IDF emphasized that Hamas employs 'psychological terror' and acts with 'cruelty.' 'The IDF urges everyone to avoid spreading rumors or publicizing comments that could cause harm to the families of the hostages,' the statement concluded. After despairing of a hostage release deal, there is some indication that Hamas may be willing to negotiate. Last week, a senior defense official reported that Hamas has given up on its demand that Israel commit to an immediate and permanent ceasefire before freeing hostages. This demand created a major impasse between Israel and Hamas during repeated hostage deal negotiations. The official indicated that Israel may be closer to reaching a hostage release agreement with Hamas than at any time in the past year. The proposal includes a 42-day pause in fighting coinciding with the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The official explained, 'There will be a price to the deal, but we are convinced that after 42 days, we'll know how to return to fighting.' Given the fact that Hamas repeatedly steals humanitarian aid, the official indicated that Israel is seeking the assistance of a private company that will be in charge of distributing the aid to Gazan civilians without Hamas's interference. He confirmed that the Palestinian Authority would not be in charge of distributing aid to Gazans at the end of the war.

House arms US Treasury with new powers to strip terror-linked cha...	The bill also includes humanitarian provisions, postponing tax filing deadlines for Americans held hostage or unlawfully detained abroad. By Jewish Breaking News The U.S. House of Representatives just handed the Treasury Department its biggest anti-terror weapon since 9/11, pushing through landmark legislation to financially strip non-profit organizations backing Hamas and other terrorist groups. The measure passed 219-184 on Thursday with strong Republican backing, creating a new category of 'terrorist supporting organizations,' defined as any entity the Treasury Secretary designates as having provided material support to a terrorist organization within the past three years. Under the bill’s framework, the Treasury must provide 'a description of such material support or resources to the extent consistent with national security and law enforcement interests.' Organizations designated as terror-supporting would have 90 days to appeal their designation. It would apply broadly across the nonprofit sector, including membership organizations, unions, and private foundations. The bill also includes humanitarian provisions, postponing tax filing deadlines for Americans held hostage or unlawfully detained abroad. 'It’s very, very simple,' said Rep. Jason Smith, the Republican chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. 'We, as members of Congress, have the duty to make sure that taxpayers are not subsidizing terrorism.' Speaking on the House floor, Smith also argued that Democrats who opposed the measure would have supported it if Vice President Kamala Harris had won the presidential election earlier this month. Supporters argue the bill provides necessary tools for protecting American taxpayers while maintaining appropriate oversight of the nonprofit sector, though various nonprofit organizations have expressed concerns about the scope of the Treasury’s newfound authority and appeal processes. 'We think this legislation is an overreach,' Jenn Holcomb, vice president of government affairs at the Council on Foundations, tells the Associated Press. 'It would allow the Secretary of the Treasury to designate a 501(c) nonprofit as a terrorist organization at their discretion. And our concern is it doesn’t have enough in there to really ensure that a nonprofit understands the reasoning that a secretary designated as such.' Political analysts also question why the bill was brought out of committee now while the Democrats still control the Senate, rather than wait until after January 20th when Republicans will hold a mandate in Congress, the White House, and the Supreme Court.

Orban invites Netanyahu to Hungary as ICC warrant divides Europea...	The Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Finland, Portugal, Slovenia, and Ireland are among the EU states that have said they would meet their ICC commitments. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday to visit Hungary but several other European nations said the Israeli premier would be detained if he set foot on their soil, following the issuing of an arrest warrant for him. The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Netanyahu, his former defense chief Yoav Gallant, and for a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu and Gallant, adamantly rejected the allegations as false, saying the ICC’s actions were politically motivated. All European Union (EU) countries are members of the court, which means they are supposed to enforce its warrants. But the diverging reactions — and the fact that EU heavyweights Germany and France have not said if they would arrest Netanyahu — highlight the major diplomatic and political challenge posed by the ICC decision, which drew swift condemnation from Israeli leaders and the White House. 'For us Europeans, this warrant exposes a real dilemma between international law, which is our law, and our foreign policy, especially for those member states that are unconditionally backing Israel,' Eurointelligence analysts wrote in a note. Assuring Netanyahu that he would face no risks if he visited Hungary, Orban branded the arrest warrants a 'brazen, cynical, and completely unacceptable decision.' Orban, who is often at odds with his EU peers, has forged warm ties with Netanyahu. 'Today I will invite Israel’s prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu, for a visit to Hungary and in that invite I will guarantee him that if he comes, the ICC ruling will have no effect in Hungary, and we will not follow its contents,' Orban said. The ICC, which does not have its own police force to carry out arrests, has only limited diplomatic means to force countries to act if they do not want to. The Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Finland, Portugal, Slovenia ,and Ireland are among EU states that have said they would meet their ICC commitments. Netanyahu will be arrested if he set foot in Ireland, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris told RTE radio. 'Yes absolutely. We support international courts and we apply their warrants,' Harris said. Cyprus, which has close ties to Israel, regards the warrants as binding in principle, a government source told Reuters. Germany Torn But Berlin declined to spell out what it would do until and unless Netanyahu planned to travel to Germany, adding that legal questions had to be clarified regarding the warrant. Germany 'is one of the biggest supporters of the ICC — this attitude is also the result of German history,' a government spokesperson said. 'At the same time, it is a consequence of German history that we share unique relations and a great responsibility with Israel,' the spokesperson added, alluding to the Nazi era. German officials said they will carefully examine the warrants and how to deal with them. 'I find it hard to imagine that we would make arrests on this basis,' government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit on Friday, pointing out that legal questions had to be clarified regarding the warrant. France was also non-committal, toning down its initial reaction, which had been to say that its response would align with ICC statutes. 'France takes note of this decision. True to its long-standing commitment to supporting international justice, it reiterates its attachment to the independent work of the Court, in accordance with the Rome Statute,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine said in a statement. Paris said on Friday the ICC decision was not a ruling but a 'formalization of an accusation.' France has been working on Lebanon ceasefire efforts and officials said cornering Netanyahu now could scupper those efforts. Non-EU Britain — also an ICC member — was similarly circumspect in its response. In the Netherlands, far-right leader Geert Wilders said he would meet his 'friend' Netanyahu in Israel soon, even though the Dutch government has said it will act on the ICC‘s arrest warrant if the Israeli leader were to visit the country. Wilders is the leader of the largest Dutch government party, but is not himself a cabinet member. The Czech Republic, which like neighboring Hungary has traditionally sided with Israel, appeared similarly conflicted. The Czech foreign ministry said Prague would respect its international legal obligations, while Prime Minister Petr Fiala described the ICC decision as 'unfortunate' and said it would undermine the court’s authority. The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, which rules Gaza, launched the ongoing war in the Middle East with its invasion of southern Israel last Oct. 7. During the onslaught, the terrorists murdered 1,200 people, wounded thousands more, and kidnapped 251 hostages while perpetrating mass sexual violence against the Israeli people. Israel responded with a military campaign aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities in neighboring Gaza.

Gaetz says he will not return to Congress after withdrawing AG bi...	Trump announced that he will instead nominate former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi (R.) for the position. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz (R.), who withdrew his nomination as President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general on Thursday, announced on Friday he will not be returning to Congress next year. 'I'm still going to be in the fight, but it's going to be from a new perch. I do not intend to join the 119th Congress,' Gaetz told podcast host Charlie Kirk in an interview. Gaetz, who was first elected to represent the Sunshine State in 2016, resigned from the House earlier this month after Trump tapped him to lead the Department of Justice. He faced pushback from Senate Republicans, however, and quickly withdrew his nomination as questions swirled around allegations that he had had sexual encounters with a minor. While the Justice Department last year closed a probe into the allegations without charging Gaetz, the House Ethics Committee was conducting its own investigation when the congressman resigned. Trump announced that he will instead nominate former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi (R.) for the position. While Gaetz, who has been one of Trump's fiercest defenders in the House, was elected this year to another term, he said he will fight for the president-elect from outside Congress. 'I'm going to be fighting for President Trump,' Gaetz said. 'I'm going to be doing whatever he asks of me, as I always have. But I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress.' It is unclear what is next for Gaetz, though some sources have speculated that he could run for governor of Florida following term-limited Republican Ron DeSantis. Gaetz added that he's 'excited' to see who fills his now-vacant seat. 'There are a number of fantastic Floridians who've stepped up to run for my seat, people who have inspired with their heroism, with their public service. And I'm actually excited to see Northwest Florida go to new heights and have great representation,' Gaetz told Kirk.

Pro-Israel stalwart Ritchie Torres hints at run for New York gove...	Torres in recent days has said that there is a 'crisis of governance' in New York State and New York City. By Andrew Bernard, JNS Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), one of Israel’s staunchest defenders in Congress, hinted at a run for higher office on Friday by taking aim at New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. The Bronx Democrat said that like U.S. President Joe Biden, Hochul could be on the path to electoral defeat. 'Kathy Hochul is the new Joe Biden,' Torres wrote. 'She may be in denial about the depth of her vulnerabilities as a Democratic nominee. A Democratic incumbent who is less popular in New York than Donald Trump is in grave danger of losing to a Republican in 2026–an outcome not seen in 30 years.' 'Waiting until it’s too late gave us a Republican President in 2024 and could give us a Republican governor in 2026,' he added. 'Let’s avoid repeating history and avoid sleepwalking toward impending disaster and defeat.' Torres in recent days has said that there is a 'crisis of governance' in New York State and New York City. 'I think part of the story of the election is an indictment of misgovernance in New York state and New York City,' Torres said in an interview on Monday with Spectrum News NY1. 'With few exceptions, nowhere was there a greater swing toward Donald Trump than in New York, which was a vote of no confidence in the leadership of New York state.' U.S. President Joe Biden carried more than 60% of the vote in New York state in 2020, but in November, Trump narrowed that lead, with Harris winning just 56% of the vote to Trump’s 44%. The largest swing of any county in New York towards Trump occurred in Torres’s Bronx county, driven by the massive shift towards Republicans among Latino voters. A poll in September showed that Hochul had just a 34% job approval rating, and in 2022 she defeated then-congressman Lee Zeldin by just 6 percentage points, the worst performance by a Democrat in a statewide race in two decades. Since taking his seat in Congress in 2021, Torres, 36, has been widely lauded by the Jewish community for his vocal efforts to combat Jew-hatred and his support for Israel in the House. 'I see my freedom as a Black Latino from the Bronx as inextricably bound to the freedom of the Jewish people,' Torres told pro-Israel rally-goers after he was awarded the Jewish Federations of North America’s Courageous Leadership Award earlier this month. Though Torres has not directly criticized New York City Mayor Eric Adams by name in the way that he has called out Hochul, Torres could also make a run for Gracie Mansion in the 2025 election as Adams fights federal bribery charges. A spokesman for Torres told JNS that 'the congressman has yet to make a final decision regarding his future' as to whether he planned to announce a run for mayor or governor.

‘This is just who we are’: Trudeau says Canada would arrest Netan...	I have to say that we’re horrified, but not shocked,' said Michael Teper, a board member of the Canadian Antisemitism Education Foundation. By Dave Gordon, JNS Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, said during a press conference on Thursday that he would have Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrested if the premier arrived on Canadian soil, in line with a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. 'First of all, as Canada has always said, it’s really important that everyone abide by international law,' Trudeau said. 'This is something we’ve been calling on from the beginning of the conflict. We are one of the founding members of the International Criminal Court and International Court of Justice.' Both the ICC and the ICJ are located in The Hague, although the justice court is a body of the United Nations and the criminal court is a stand-alone body. The ICC issued warrants on Thursday for Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, the former Israeli defense minister, among others. 'We stand up for international law, and we will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts,' Trudeau added. 'This is just who we are as Canadians.' Netanyahu has called the court’s decision a 'modern Dreyfus trial,' while U.S. President Joe Biden recycled a six-month-old statement, in which he referred to the court’s decision as 'outrageous.' Leo Housakos, a Quebec senator, wrote that Trudeau’s were 'disgraceful comments' that suggested that 'Canadian authorities would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.' 'This ill-considered endorsement of the ICC’s politically motivated actions is a slap in the face to our ally and to every innocent Israeli still being held hostage,' Housakos stated. 'We stand with the people of Israel and support their right to self-defense against terrorism. The actions taken by both the ICC and Justin Trudeau should be condemned as a dangerous precedent that threatens global stability and the principles of international law.' 'I have to say that we’re horrified, but not shocked,' Michael Teper, a board member of Canadian Antisemitism Education Foundation, told JNS of Trudeau’s comments. 'The statement is sadly highly predictable and indicative of the overall attitudes of the government of Canada these days,' Teper said. 'It’s really just sad that Mr. Trudeau is taking this approach.' Earlier in the day, Anthony Housefather, Canadian special advisor on Jewish community relations and antisemitism, wrote that 'Israel was attacked by terrorists on Oct 7. The warrant issued by the ICC today against Netanyahu and Gallant claims their crimes started as early as Oct. 8. A day Israel was in shock, grief and mourning. The ICC discredits itself by its actions today.' Amir Epstein, director of Tafsik, an Israel advocacy group with affiliates in Toronto and Winnipeg, told JNS that 'the idea that Canada is aligned with Islamofascist countries that dictate what the ICC, the ICJ and the United Nations say and do is no longer surprising to anyone.' He noted that dictators are able to 'come freely into Canada,' which 'is both laughable and embarrassing at the same time.' The Abraham Global Peace Initiative in Toronto stated that it 'expresses its strongest condemnation' of the court’s 'reckless and politically motivated' action. 'The decision underscores the ICC’s troubling trend of weaponization against Israel, prepared by the Palestinian Authority and its allies since 2015,' the group said. 'The ICC’s arrest warrants dangerously distort international justice by empowering extremists, exacerbating global antisemitism and undermining peace efforts during a time of heightened tensions.'

By Jewish Breaking News Donald Trump has nominated former Florida AG Pam Bondi as the next Attorney General of the United States after Matt Gaetz withdrew from AG consideration. The president-elect wrote of the nomination: 'I am proud to announce former Attorney General of the Great State of Florida, Pam Bondi, as our next Attorney General of the United States. Pam was a prosecutor for nearly 20 years, where she was very tough on Violent Criminals, and made the streets safe for Florida Families. Then, as Florida’s first female Attorney General, she worked to stop the trafficking of deadly drugs, and reduce the tragedy of Fentanyl Overdose Deaths, which have destroyed many families across our Country. She did such an incredible job, that I asked her to serve on our Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission during my first Term — We saved many lives! For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans – Not anymore.

Israeli defense minister orders end to administrative arrests for...	Emergency security measure used to prevent terror attacks will no longer be employed against Israeli citizens living in Judea and Samaria, Defense Minister Israel Katz rules. By World Israel News Staff Israel's defense minister has ended the practice of using an emergency provision to place Israeli Jews living in Judea and Samaria under extended arrest without trial. On Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) announced that he has instructed his ministry to halt the practice of using administrative arrest or detention against Israeli citizens living in Judea and Samaria. 'In the current climate, where Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria face significant threats of Palestinian terrorism, supported by the Iranian axis of evil seeking to establish a terror front against Israel, and where international sanctions unfairly target settlers and settlement organizations, it is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such a severe step,' Katz said Friday. 'When there are suspicions of criminal activity, those responsible can and should be prosecuted. If no criminal charges can be brought, other preventive measures must be employed that do not involve administrative detention.' 'I unequivocally condemn any acts of violence against Palestinians and taking the law into one’s own hands,' Katz continued, adding: 'It is critical to allow the IDF and other security forces to combat Palestinian terrorism and violence effectively, without individuals undermining the rule of law.' Administrative detentions were first adopted by the British Mandate, as one of the emergency regulations of 1945. The emergency measures were continued on by the State of Israel following its establishment in 1948, allowing state authorities to detain individuals for up to six months at a time without a trial, indictment, or proof of wrongdoing, as a preventative measure to confront a perceived threat to national security. Such administrative orders can be issued by the Shin Bet internal security agency, the Israel Police, or Israeli courts. In Judea and Samaria, the orders are issued under the authority of the Defense Ministry, which administers those parts of Judea and Samaria which are under Israeli control. According to Katz's office, the minister met with Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar earlier this week, advising him of the policy change and asking Bar to 'put alternative tools in place.' Administrative arrest is used frequently against Palestinian Arabs suspected of plotting terrorist attacks against Israelis, but has also been employed occasionally against Israeli Jews, including residents of Judea and Samaria.

Israel Aerospace Industries reports most profitable year in its h...	The growth was driven by IAI’s Missile and Space Systems Division, with $1.87 billion in sales for the first nine months of 2024, up from $1.63 billion in 2023. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel Aerospace Industries reported a record-breaking order backlog of approximately $25 billion and a 74% increase in net income in its third-quarter earnings report released on Thursday. 'During this time, we have achieved unprecedented milestones, not just in technological and business terms but as a testament to our commitment to excellence,' said IAI chairman Amir Peretz. Net income for the nine months ending September 30 rose sharply to $416 million, up from $239 million in the same period last year, making it the most profitable period in the state-owned company’s history. For the third quarter alone, net income increased to $122 million, a significant rise from $74 million in Q3 2023. The growth was driven by IAI’s Missile and Space Systems Division, with $1.87 billion in sales for the first nine months of 2024, up from $1.63 billion in 2023. The Arrow missile system earned global acclaim, supported by increased R&D investment of $81 million in Q3, up from $65 million. IAI also reported a record-breaking $25 billion order backlog as of September 30, 2024. This represents a $7.22 billion increase from the previous year and secures 3.5 years of operations at current sales volumes. International demand for Israel’s military technology has surged as European countries increased their defense budgets in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Israel is developing a multilayered aerial defense system that has drawn global attention. The Arrow-3 system, which is designed to intercept ballistic missiles, had its first operational success when it shot down a ballistic missile fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen in November. It is widely believed to be the first time a missile was intercepted in outer space, but Israeli officials have not confirmed this. Operating income during the nine months grew to $431 million, up from $292 million in 2023. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the nine-month period reached $646 million, a 33% increase year-over-year, while gross profit for the third quarter climbed 25% to $282 million, reflecting an 18% profit margin. The company’s sales also rose, reaching $4.39 billion for the nine-month period, a 13% increase from $3.87 billion in the previous year. Third-quarter sales alone totaled $1.54 billion, up 16% from Q3 2023. This growth was driven by increased demand across all business divisions, with particularly strong performance in the Military and Aviation groups. 'Despite a national crisis, IAI maintained supply chain continuity and expanded its global relationships. Our systems play a critical role in Israel’s defense while strengthening our international standing,' said IAI President and CEO Boaz Levy.

Houthi missile triggers alarms in Judea	In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv, in response to which Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port in a major aerial attack. By JNS A ballistic missile fired at Israel by Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists in Yemen activated air-raid sirens in the Gush Etzion region of Judea and the Dead Sea area on Thursday night, the Israel Defense Forces said. 'Following the sirens that sounded in the areas of Judea and the Dead Sea, one launch that was approaching from Yemen towards Israeli territory was intercepted by the Israeli Air Force prior to crossing into Israeli territory,' the military confirmed in a statement on social media. Alerts were activated in the Gush Etzion communities of Tekoa, Pnei Kedem, Nokdim, Ma’ale Rehav’am, Ma’aleh Amos, Metzad and Kfar Eldad, as well as in Ein Gedi and Mitzpe Shalem near the Dead Sea, sending thousands of Israeli civilians running for bomb shelters. On Nov. 11, a Houthi missile triggered sirens across the Judean Foothills and the Lachish region, including in Beit Shemesh, Adora, Tzora, Beit Guvrin, Sarigim, Karmei Tzur, Kfar Etzion and Kiryat Arba. The missile was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, according to the IDF. Yemen’s Houthi militia has launched numerous attacks on the Jewish state in support of Hamas in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. In July, a Houthi drone killed a civilian in central Tel Aviv, in response to which Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah Port in a major aerial attack. On Sept. 29, the Israeli Air Force carried out dozens of strikes in the area of Hodeidah. Jerusalem said the targets included 'power plants and a seaport, which were used by the Houthis to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil.'

‘Outrageous’ – Biden blasts ICC arrest warrants for Israeli leade...	Biden administration 'fundamentally rejects' ICC's decision to push for arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling the move 'outrageous' and 'troubling.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden on Thursday condemned the International Criminal Court at The Hague's decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials, calling the move 'outrageous.' On Thursday, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and slain Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, writing that there were 'reasonable grounds' to believe the three had violated international law during the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel. In a statement issued by the White House Thursday evening, Biden rejected the attempt to draw equivalency between Israel and Hamas. 'The ICC issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous. Let me be clear once again: whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.' The White House National Security Council also issued a statement condemning the ICC decision, calling it 'troubling.' 'The United States fundamentally rejects the Court’s decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials,' a NSC spokesperson said Thursday. 'We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.' Republican lawmakers also castigated the ICC's decision, with congressional Republican leaders pushing for sanctions against the court. 'The ICC’s decision to target America’s ally, Israel, is antisemitic, reprehensible, and completely ridiculous,' House Speaker Mike Johnson tweeted. 'It has absolutely no jurisdiction over Israel or the United States, and these illegitimate warrants are an attack on the very concepts of sovereignty and due process.' Johnson noted that the lower chamber of Congress voted earlier this year to impose sanctions on the ICC, and urged Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to put the bill to a vote.

Trump mulling sanctions on ICC judges over Netanyahu arrest warra...	The president-elect is reportedly preparing a list of possible sanctions for the International Criminal Court, including personal measures targeting chief prosecutor Karim Khan and ICC judges, after the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The incoming Trump administration is drafting a list of possible measures to take against the International Criminal Court at The Hague in response to the court's decision Thursday to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Israel's public broadcaster Kan reported Friday. U.S. sources cited in the Kan report said the president-elect and his advisers are currently mulling possible sanctions against the International Criminal Court, including punitive actions targeting not only ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, but also the ICC judges who signed off on the arrest warrants. 'The possibility is of imposing personal sanctions not only on the prosecutor or the court - but also on the judges themselves who issued the order,' one source was quoted as saying. Trump's National Security Advisor-designate Michael Waltz, who currently represents Florida's 6th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives, castigated the ICC's decision Thursday as 'antisemitic.' 'The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,' Waltz tweeted. 'Israel has lawfully defended its people & borders from genocidal terrorists. You can expect a strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC & UN come January.' Congressional Republican leaders also condemned the ICC for issuing the arrest warrants, pledging to move forward with legislation sanctioning the court. 'The ICC’s decision to target America’s ally, Israel, is antisemitic, reprehensible, and completely ridiculous,' House Speaker Mike Johnson tweeted. 'It has absolutely no jurisdiction over Israel or the United States, and these illegitimate warrants are an attack on the very concepts of sovereignty and due process.' 'The U.S. Senate should vote immediately on the bipartisan Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act, and President Biden should take clear steps to prevent these warrants from being enforced. If Senator Schumer and President Biden do not act now, they will most assuredly invite future lawfare against Israel and the United States. We cannot afford to show weakness.'

UNRWA official met with Palestinian terror groups secretly, decla...	The former commissioner emphasized a 'spirit of partnership' and said UNRWA's decisions could be challenged or even reversed at the terror group representatives' requests. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A former UNRWA commissioner met with Palestinian terror groups secretly in Lebanon in 2017 and told them, 'No one can separate us' and 'We are one,' UN Watch reports. Former UNRWA commissioner general Pierre Krahenbuhl held a meeting in Beirut in February 2017, and attending were Chief in Lebanon Hakam Shawan, Ali Baraka from Hamas, Abu Imad Al-Rifai from the Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Salah Al-Youssef from the PFLP and representatives from other Palestinian terror groups. Hamas official Ali Baraka had close ties with terrorist entities in Syria and Iran and was listed by the US as a wanted terrorist. Abu Imad al-Rifai, a Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader, bragged about organizing suicide bombings targeting US and British military personnel. Krahenbuhl was apparently aware that the meetings were problematic because he insisted on secrecy and warned exposure could 'lead to a loss between donor countries and UNRWA, which might result in reduced or even halted funding.' The former commissioner emphasized a 'spirit of partnership' and said UNRWA's decisions could be challenged or even reversed at the terror group representatives' request. Krahenbuhl said they had the opportunity to meet with him 'a thousand times' to discuss their concerns or objections to policies and could reverse them. He said, 'Your cooperation with us in security matters and your commitment to not closing UNRWA institutions, facilities, schools, or offices also completes this partnership. If we can achieve this, it means we are united, and no one can separate us.' These documents exposed by UNWatch give insight into how UNRWA established close ties with terror groups to the extent that Hamas embedded its terror infrastructures inside UNRWA buildings and schools, with many UNRWA teachers also involved in acts of terrorism. UNRWA was met with scrutiny last year when it came to light that a number of UNRWA workers were actively involved in the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7th.

Netanyahu calls ICC arrest warrant a ‘modern Dreyfus trial’	The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Netanyahu, Gallant, and a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. By Algemeiner Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday lambasted the International Criminal Court’s decision to issue arrest warrants for him and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, calling the ruling 'antisemitic' and the charges on which it was based false. 'Israel utterly rejects the false and absurd charges of the International Criminal Court [ICC], a biased and discriminatory political body,' Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. 'No war is more just than the war Israel has been waging in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, when the Hamas terrorist organization launched a murderous assault and perpetrated the largest massacre against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.' The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Netanyahu, Gallant, and a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. The war began last Oct. 7, when the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, which rules Gaza, invaded neighboring southern Israel and perpetrated a bloody massacre that killed 1,200 people and wounded thousands more. During the onslaught, the terrorists perpetrated mass sexual violence and kidnapped over 250 hostages. Israel responded with a military campaign aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities in Gaza. However, the ICC said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for starvation in Gaza and the persecution of Palestinians — charges vehemently denied by Israel, which has provided significant humanitarian aid into the war-torn enclave throughout the war. The statement from Netanyahu’s office noted that the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, initially made his surprise demand for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on the same day in May that he suddenly canceled a long-planned visit to both Gaza and Israel to collect evidence of alleged war crimes. The last-second cancellation infuriated US and British leaders, according to Reuters, which reported that the trip would have offered Israeli leaders a first opportunity to present their position and outline any action they were taking to respond to the war crime allegations. 'The antisemitic decision of the International Criminal Court is a modern Dreyfus trial — and will end the same way,' the Israeli premier added. Albert Dreyfus was a French army officer falsely convicted of espionage in a landmark case that sparked antisemitic violence across France. Antisemitism has surged globally since Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre, amid the ensuing Gaza war, with countries around the world reporting record spikes in antisemitic attacks and other incidents targeting Jewish communities. Netanyahu vowed that 'no anti-Israel decision will prevent the State of Israel from defending its citizens.' In a rare show of unity, bitter political foes of Netanyahu from across the Israeli political spectrum joined him in condemning the ICC decision. 'Israel defends its life against terrorist organizations that attacked, murdered, and raped our citizens. These arrest warrants are a reward for terrorism,' said Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid. Benny Gantz, who joined Netanyahu’s war cabinet in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack but quit in June, lambasted what he called the ICC’s 'moral blindness,' calling the ruling a 'shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten.' Gallant, who Netanyahu fired as defense minister earlier this month, posted on social media that the ICC’s 'outrageous decision will live in infamy.' 'It places the State of Israel and the brutal terrorist organization Hamas in the same equation. Today’s decision legitimizes and rewards the murder, rape and kidnapping of Israeli children, women, and men,' Gallant continued. 'The State of Israel will not be deterred — long gone are the days when the nation of Israel could not defend itself. The IDF will continue fighting to achieve the goals of this war: Dismantling Hamas, ensuring the return of the hostages, and enabling Israel’s northern communities to return to their homes.' The former defense chief added that he was 'proud of the extraordinary privilege I had in leading Israel’s defense establishment during our hardest hour.' President Isaac Herzog similarly said the ICC 'chose the side of terrorism and evil over democracy and freedom and turned the international justice system itself into a human shield for Hamas’s crimes against humanity.' The ICC has 'lost all legitimacy' after issuing the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said. 'A dark moment for the International Criminal Court,' Saar posted on X, adding that it had issued 'absurd orders without authority.' Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said the ICC showed 'once again that it is antisemitic through and through.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich urged Netanyahu to sever contact with the court and impose sanctions on the Palestinian Authority and its leaders. 'Israel will continue to defend its citizens and its security with determination,' he said. There was no immediate comment from Gallant on the ICC decision. 'Israel is fighting … the most just of wars against pure evil. All Israelis, left and right, stand behind the war, whose goals are to release the kidnapped Israelis, demolish Hamas and restore security to Israel. Shame on ICC,' wrote former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a right-wing critic of Netanyahu. Amir Ohana, speaker of Israel’s parliament, known as the Knesset, and a top member of Netanyahu’s Likud Party, expressed similar sentiments: 'Targeting the democratically elected leaders of Israel, the Middle East’s only democracy and the world’s only Jewish state, is nothing short of an assault on justice, truth, and the universal right of self-defense.' The ICC has no jurisdiction over Israel as it is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the court. Other countries including the US have similarly not signed the ICC charter. However, the ICC has asserted jurisdiction by accepting 'Palestine' as a signatory in 2015, despite no such state being recognized under international law. Countries that are signatories, including several in Europe, are bound by the charter to enforce its rulings and arrest warrants.

‘You can expect a strong response’: Republicans, weeks away from ...	The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,' Rep. Michael Waltz (R., Fla.). By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon The International Criminal Court's decision to issue arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister sparked a flurry of promises from Republican leaders to sanction the court and erode its legitimacy on the world stage. The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this year that would do just that, though Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) blocked it from coming to a vote in the upper chamber. In a matter of weeks, however, Schumer will be in the minority—and Republicans will control both the House and the executive branch. Incoming GOP leaders in the House, Senate, and White House made clear that, come January, the ICC will face sanctions and other punitive measures. 'The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,' Rep. Michael Waltz (R., Fla.), President-elect Donald Trump's incoming national security adviser, said in reference to the court's determination that Netanyahu and former Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant are guilty of war crimes. 'Israel has lawfully defended its people & borders from genocidal terrorists. You can expect a strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC & UN come January.' House majority whip Tom Emmer (R., Minn.) echoed Waltz, telling the Washington Free Beacon that Republicans in the lower chamber 'will continue doing everything in our power to combat this pro-terrorist, illegitimate court.' 'House Republicans passed bipartisan legislation five months ago to sanction the ICC for unlawfully targeting our ally, yet it has done nothing but collect dust on Chuck Schumer's desk,' Emmer said. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) also took aim at Schumer. 'It is time for the U.S. Senate to act and sanction this irresponsible body,' he said. 'Now.' Following months of debate, the ICC determined that Israel has intentionally starved Palestinians in the war-torn Gaza Strip during its yearlong war to eradicate Hamas. The charges carry little legal weight, as the United States and Israel are not members of the court. It's unlikely that an ICC sanctions bill will land on President Joe Biden's desk before the octogenarian leaves office. Whether such a bill passes this year or in January, however, it will do so with bipartisan support. Sen. John Fetterman (Pa.), often the lone Democratic voice defending Israel from international persecution, categorically rejected the ICC's charges, indicating that the next Senate's Republican majority will have at least one ally in its fight against the court. 'No standing, relevance, or path,' Fetterman wrote on X. 'F—k that.' In addition to pushing for sanctions, Graham has led his own investigation into ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, who is accused of sexually harassing female colleagues. That investigation is also likely to ramp up come January. The ICC, in a bid to appear neutral, also issued arrest warrants for several Hamas leaders, including military chief Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, who cannot face charges because he was killed in July by an Israeli airstrike. Israeli leaders quickly condemned the ICC after the court announced the arrest warrants. Netanyahu's office said that 'no anti-Israel decision will stop Israel from defending its citizens.' The ICC's case is largely built upon allegations that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war. The court claimed the troves of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip is not enough to alleviate hunger among Palestinian civilians, though it did not mention that Hamas steals much of this aid. It also dismissed Israeli efforts to boost food deliveries in recent months. 'Decisions allowing or increasing humanitarian assistance into Gaza were often conditional,' the court wrote, adding that they were 'not sufficient to improve the population's access to essential goods.' Israel is also being prosecuted at a different court, the United Nations' International Court of Justice, over similar charges. The case was brought by South Africa thanks to underwriting from Iran, Qatar, and several Hamas-linked entities, the Free Beacon reported last week.

‘West Wing’ director to helm epic tale of American who built Isra...	The significance of Schwimmer’s contribution wasn’t lost on Israel’s founding father, David Ben-Gurion, who declared him 'America’s greatest gift to Israel.' By Jewish Breaking News Before Israel had an air force, it had Al Schwimmer – an American engineer who orchestrated one of the most daring covert operations in modern history, with help from an unlikely crew including Frank Sinatra and Meyer Lansky. Warner Bros. has tapped Aaron Sorkin to bring this extraordinary tale to the big screen. Behind the controls of military aircraft during World War II, Al Schwimmer cut his teeth as a flight engineer for TWA and the U.S. Air Transport Command. But it was his early experience as an aerospace engineer at Lockheed that would lay the groundwork for an operation that seems scripted for the silver screen. In 1948, while Jews were battling to establish their homeland, Schwimmer assembled a remarkable team of World War II veterans for a mission that would reshape Middle Eastern history. Schwimmer’s unlikely allies included notorious mobster Meyer Lansky, entertainment icon Frank Sinatra, and even Pee-wee Herman’s father, forming what might be the most eclectic covert team ever assembled. Together, they orchestrated the smuggling of 125 military aircraft and over 50,000 weapons to British-Mandated Palestine in a direct challenge to an American embargo at the time. The significance of Schwimmer’s contribution wasn’t lost on Israel’s founding father, David Ben-Gurion, who declared him 'America’s greatest gift to Israel.' His actions laid the groundwork for what would become one of the world’s most formidable air forces. Sorkin’s adaptation draws from David Kushner’s Business Insider article 'America’s Greatest Gift to Israel,' with Gotham Group’s Eric Robinson and Ellen Goldsmith-Vein producing. For Sorkin, who won an Oscar for 'The Social Network' and earned critical acclaim for 'The West Wing,' Schwimmer’s story continues his tradition of bringing pivotal historical moments to life on screen.

Hamas has given up demand to end the war before freeing hostages ...	The official indicated that Israel may be closer to reaching a hostage release deal with Hamas than at any time in the past year. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News According to a senior defense official, Hamas has given up on its demand that Israel commit to an immediate and permanent ceasefire before freeing hostages, Arutz Sheva reports. This demand created a major impasse between Israel and Hamas during repeated hostage deal negotiations. The official indicated that Israel may be closer to reaching a hostage release agreement with Hamas than at any time in the past year. The proposal includes a 42-day pause in fighting coinciding with the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The official explained, 'There will be a price to the deal, but we are convinced that after 42 days, we'll know how to return to fighting.' Given the fact that Hamas repeatedly steals humanitarian aid, the official indicated that Israel is seeking the assistance of a private company that will be in charge of distributing the aid to Gazan civilians without Hamas's interference. He confirmed that the Palestinian Authority would not be in charge of distributing aid to Gazans at the end of the war. The defense official also said that now was an opportune time to attack Iran's nuclear facilities and declared, 'Iran was never as exposed to an attack as it is now.' Regarding Hezbollah, he said the terror group may be ready to agree to a ceasefire deal, and areas of disagreement are being resolved. Earlier this month, Mossad Director David Barnea declared that it was unlikely that the hostages would be released through a deal negotiated between Israel and Hamas. Israel's Channel 12 reported that Barnea, who has headed up Israel's negotiating team in Doha, Qatar, met with relatives of Israeli captives still held in the Gaza Strip to update them on the efforts to secure the release of their loved ones. According to the report, Barnea attempted to lower expectations, telling the relatives that he believed that the chances of ever achieving an agreement with Hamas were low. 'What's going on with the deal at the moment?' the relative of a hostage asked Barnea recently. 'I still haven't gotten an official answer from the mediator, not to the Qatari proposal, nor to the Egyptian proposal, and therefore it pays to wait,' Barnea responded. 'At the moment, the chances for a small deal are low, Hamas is insisting on ending the war.'

Jessica Tisch, Jewish public servant, appointed as commissioner o...	Tisch will be the city’s fourth police commissioner since Adams took office in January 2022. By Luke Tress, JTA Jessica Tisch, a longtime New York City public servant, was appointed as the commissioner of the NYPD on Wednesday. Tisch, who comes from a prominent Jewish family, will become the second woman to head the city’s police department in its 179-year history. Tisch, 43, is a 12-year veteran of the largest police department in the U.S. — she was previously the NYPD’s deputy commissioner for information — and was appointed as the city’s sanitation commissioner in 2022. In that role, she prioritized fighting against the city’s rats, going viral for her pronouncements against the rodents. As police commissioner, a role she will assume on Monday, Tisch said she would work to keep New York 'safe and vibrant,' fight crime and disorder, build on the city’s counterterrorism abilities and implement police technology. 'We will do all of this with integrity as we continue to build public confidence and trust in the police,' Tisch said in a Wednesday statement. Tisch will be the city’s fourth police commissioner since Adams took office in January 2022. Announcing the appointment, Mayor Eric Adams said Tisch was 'one of the most successful managers in our administration.' Adams said, 'To ensure New Yorkers have the ability to thrive in our city, we need a strong, battle-tested leader who will continue to drive down crime and ensure New Yorkers are safe and feel safe, and I cannot think of a leader more up to the task than Commissioner Jessica Tisch.' Tisch’s father, James, is the president and co-C.E.O. of the Loews Corporation, which her family has led since the 1950s. Her mother, Merryl Tisch, is the former chair of the New York State Board of Regents and chairperson emeritus of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty. The family has a stake in the New York Giants and a hand in some of the city’s top Jewish nonprofits, and its name adorns one of the city’s hospitals and New York University’s arts school The couple’s foundation distributed $18 million in grants in 2023, mostly to the Jewish Communal Fund. In 2006, Tisch married Dan Levine, who works as a venture capitalist, in a ceremony at Central Synagogue in Manhattan that was officiated by her grandfather, Rabbi Philip Hiat, a Reform rabbi known for his interfaith work. Tisch joined the NYPD as a counterterrorism analyst in 2008, the mayor’s office said. She climbed the force’s ranks until she left to become the commissioner of the city’s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications from 2019 to 2022. She began her public service career after attending Harvard University as an undergraduate, as well as Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. 'My grandmother was incredibly supportive,' Tisch told The New Yorker. 'Everyone else was, like, ‘Really?’ The NYPD has about 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilian employees, and a budget of $5.8 billion. The department is seen as closely tied to Adams, who had a career in the NYPD before entering politics. The Adams administration has been in turmoil in recent months due to charges of corruption. Adams pleaded not guilty to bribery charges in September. The previous commissioner, Edward Caban, resigned in September after investigators confiscated his phone in a federal investigation into Adams’ associates. Caban’s lawyers said at the time that he was not the target of the investigation. The subsequent interim police commissioner, Tom Donlon, also became the subject of a federal probe.

‘A dark day for justice’: Israelis react to Netanyahu, Gallant ar...	Netanyahu and Gallant are now liable for arrest if they travel to countries that are party to the ICC. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel officials across the political spectrum reacted with anger and outrage after the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued unprecedented arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday. It is the first time warrants have been issued against leaders from a democratic country. The ICC ruling represents 'a dark day for justice and humanity,' said Israeli President Isaac Herzog. 'Taken in bad faith, the outrageous decision at the ICC has turned universal justice into a universal laughingstock. It makes a mockery of the sacrifice of all those who fight for justice – from the Allied victory over the Nazis till today,' he said. 'It ignores the plight of the 101 Israeli hostages held in brutal captivity by Hamas in Gaza. It ignores Hamas’ cynical use of its own people as human shields. It ignores the basic fact that Israel was barbarically attacked and has the duty and right to defend its people. It ignores the fact that Israel is a vibrant democracy, acting under international humanitarian law, and going to great lengths to provide for the humanitarian needs of the civilian population,' Herzog added. The unanimous ruling, signed by Judges Nicolas Guillou, Reine Adélaïde Sophie Alapini Gansou and Beti Hohler, said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant committed crimes against humanity in Gaza, including murder, persecution and using starvation as a tactic of warfare. A statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office called ICC judges 'antisemitic,' Prosecutor Karim Khan 'corrupt,' and insisted Israel would not be deterred from bringing its hostages home and eliminating Hamas as a threat. 'The decision to issue an arrest warrant against the Prime Minister was made by a corrupt chief prosecutor who is trying to save himself from sexual harassment accusations and biased judges who are motivated by antisemitic hatred of Israel,' the statement said. 'No anti-Israel decision will prevent the State of Israel from defending its citizens.' Current Defense Minister Israel Katz called warrants 'a moral disgrace that is entirely tinged with antisemitism and that degrades the international legal system to an unprecedented low. This is a shameful decision that serves the head of the snake, Iran, and its proxies.' Netanyahu and Gallant are now liable for arrest if they travel to countries that are party to the ICC. Israel is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction. The ICC charter prohibits the court from prosecuting nationals of countries with independent judiciaries. The legal action was spearheaded by the Palestinian Authority, which in 2014 was recognized by the court as a 'State,' leading Israeli officials to accuse the ICC of being politicized. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Deif. Although he was killed in an airstrike in July, Hamas never confirmed Deif’s death. Other national leaders with outstanding ICC warrants include Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, Libyan general Mahmoud al-Warfali and God’s Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

After Argamani knocks on the front door, the birthday girl opens it and is thrilled to see the two women surprise her By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Noa Argamani, who was abducted by Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists during their deadly rampage across southern Israel last Oct. 7, helped surprise another former hostage kidnapped during the onslaught in Israel on Monday with pastries for her 10th birthday. Argamani, 27, who was taken from the Nova music festival and rescued by IDF soldiers, and Hila Rotem Shoshani, 13, who was released in a hostage deal, together surprised Emily Hand at her home in honor of her birthday. A video from the scene that was shared on Instagram shows Argamani and Shoshani arriving at Hand’s house, carrying trays with what appear to be traditional Moroccan donuts and a birthday candle. After Argamani knocks on the front door, the birthday girl opens it and is thrilled to see the two women surprise her Emily Hand spent her 9th birthday as a hostage in Gaza.

Here’s to many more happy birthdays, Emily pic.twitter.com/Wtn5qbZPyP — Israel ישראל (@Israel) November 20, 2024 Irish-Israeli citizen Hand was at Shoshani’s house for a sleepover when they were both taken captive by Hamas terrorists who attacked their community of Kibbutz Be’eri on Oct. 7, 2023. They were held captive for almost two months and eventually released as part of a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas on Nov. 25, 2023. Hand was one of the youngest hostages abducted by the terrorists on Oct. 7. Shoshani’s mother, Raaya, was also taken hostage by Hamas. She was released on Nov. 29 of last year as part of a temporary ceasefire deal, brokered by Qatar and the United States, between Hamas and Israel. Argamani was rescued on June 8 of this year, when Israeli soldiers raided the apartment where she was being held in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.

By JNS The Israel Defense Forces detained a Syrian who crossed into the Jewish state’s territory in the Golan Heights on Thursday, the IDF announced. According to the Israeli military, the suspect individual 'did not stop in response to calls by soldiers, was shot in the leg and transferred to Ziv Medical Center in Safed for further treatment and investigation.' Ynet reported that the suspect crossed into the Israeli side of the Alpha Line, which marks the demilitarized zone between the two countries. He reportedly did not breach the Israeli security fence in the area. Concerns in Israel have grown in recent months over the possibility of a cross-border mass murder and kidnap attack launched by Iran-backed terrorist militias in southern Syria and targeting the Golan Heights. The military confirmed to JNS on Nov. 13 that it started work on a barrier on the Golan’s frontier with the Arab Republic 'to thwart a possible terrorist invasion and protect the security of Israel’s borders.' Earlier this month, the IDF revealed that its forces captured a pro-Iranian regime terrorist operative during a raid in Syria. The raid was carried out by members of the Egoz commando unit along with field interrogators of the Military Intelligence Directorate’s Unit 504. Ali Soleiman al-Assi, from Saida in the southern part of the country, was tasked by Iran with 'gathering intelligence on IDF troops in the border area for future terror activity of the network,' the military said.

‘Dark day for justice’ – ICC issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu...	International Criminal Court at The Hague issues warrants calling for the arrest of Israel's prime minister and its former defense minister, drawing sharp condemnation from both the Israeli government and Opposition. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff The International Criminal Court at The Hague issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, six months after ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced plans for the warrants. Marking the first time the ICC has called for the arrest of leaders of a democratic country, judges wrote that there were 'reasonable grounds to believe' that Netanyahu and Gallant had violated international law between October 8th, 2023, and May 20th, 2024, marking the period spanning the beginning of Israel's response to the October 7th invasion through the first weeks of the Rafah operation in southern Gaza. The decision immediately drew sharp condemnation from not only the Israeli government, but also from Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, a former rival of Netanyahu and critic of the Netanyahu government, as well as from Opposition leaders. 'This is a dark day for justice. A dark day for humanity,' Herzog tweeted Thursday afternoon. 'Taken in bad faith, the outrageous decision at the ICC has turned universal justice into a universal laughing stock. It makes a mockery of the sacrifice of all those who fight for justice - from the Allied victory over the Nazis till today.' 'It ignores the plight of the 101 Israeli hostages held in brutal captivity by Hamas in Gaza. It ignores Hamas’ cynical use of its own people as human shields.' 'It ignores the basic fact that Israel was barbarically attacked and has the duty and right to defend its people. It ignores the fact that Israel is a vibrant democracy, acting under international humanitarian law, and going to great lengths to provide for the humanitarian needs of the civilian population.' 'Indeed, the decision has chosen the side of terror and evil over democracy and freedom, and turned the very system of justice into a human shield for Hamas’ crimes against humanity.' 'This cynical exploitation of the international legal institutions reminds us once again of the need for true moral clarity in the face of an Iranian empire of evil that seeks to destabilize our region and the world, and destroy the very institutions of the free world.' Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called the warrants a 'mark of shame' for the ICC, saying that Israelis 'left and right, stand behind the war.' Opposition Leader Yair Lapid excoriated the ICC over the issuing of the warrants, calling them a 'reward for terrorism.' 'Israel is defending itself against terrorist organizations that attacked, murdered and raped our citizens. These arrest warrants are a reward for terrorism.' Fellow Opposition leader MK Benny Gantz condemned the ICC decision as 'moral blindness' which will 'never be forgotten.' Yair Golan, chairman of the left-wing The Democrats party also took aim at the ICC. 'This is a shameful decision of the International Court in The Hague,' Golan said. 'Israel had and will always have the right to defend itself against our enemies.' While the ICC warrants cannot be enforced so long as Netanyahu and Gallant remain in Israel, the two could face arrest if they travel to any of the 123 countries bound by the Rome Statute which established the ICC.

Massive Israeli airstrike kills 68 in Syria	Bombings hit three positions in Palmyra used by Hezbollah and other pro-Iranian groups. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A series of Israeli airstrikes in eastern Syria killed at least 68 people Wednesday a Syrian opposition group said, making it the deadliest air attack attributed to Israel in Syria in years. According to reports by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based anti-regime organization, Israeli warplanes carried out three airstrikes on positions occupied by Hezbollah terrorists and members of other pro-Iranian proxy groups Wednesday afternoon. The airstrikes targeted Hezbollah and the Nujaba militia in the city of Palmyra, in Syria's Homs district, SOHR reported, stating Thursday that the death toll from the strikes had risen to 68. All 68 reported fatalities were combatants, SOHR claimed, including 42 Syrian nationals affiliated with pro-Iranian militias, five of whom were officers working in conjunction with Hezbollah. The remaining fatalities include 4 Lebanese members of Hezbollah, and 22 other non-Syrian nationals, whom the report said were affiliated with the Nujaba Movement. Forty-three others were injured in the strikes, SOHR reported, including 7 civilians. Syria's SANA state media outlet confirmed the attacks, claiming Wednesday that 36 Syrian nationals had been killed and more than 50 others injured. 'The Zionist entity committed a horrific crime in Palmyra today, which claimed the lives of 36 citizens and injured dozens of others in the air aggression carried out by Israeli aircraft, targeting a number of residential buildings and causing material damage to the buildings and surrounding area.' Syria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in a statement to SANA Wednesday. According to Syria's defense ministry, 10 of the Syrian nationals killed in the airstrikes were soldiers in the Syrian army. The Israeli military declined to respond to reports of the airstrikes. SOHR claimed that the three airstrikes included a pair of bombings in Palmyra's Al-Jam'iya quarter, striking a weapons depot and a building used by leaders of pro-Iranian militias.

Douglas Murray, Ben Shapiro tell thousands in Jerusalem: You are ...	Several Knesset members also attended the event, including Amichai Chikli, Amihai Eliyahu, Dan Illouz, Ohad Tal, Ariel Kellner and Simcha Rothman. By David Isaac, JNS Two giants of political conservatism, Douglas Murray and Ben Shapiro, starred at Jerusalem’s International Convention Center on Tuesday night before a sold-out crowd of more than 3,000 in what might best be described as a mutual admiration society, with the crowd applauding its pro-Israel champions as they in turn voiced esteem for Israelis’ grit and fighting spirit. 'Thank you on behalf of Western civilization for fighting the fight the rest of the West should be fighting,' Shapiro told the audience at the 'Freedom of Zion' conference. He asked those with loved ones who had served in the Israel Defense Forces in the past year to stand up. Nearly all did. 'That’s unique. It’s something that doesn’t exist in the West anymore,' Shapiro said, describing it as a 'civic militarism' once common in Western societies. 'There are people here … who … put their bodies on the line defending civilization. I am merely a writer,' said Murray. 'If I give you any encouragement, you should know that the encouragement you give me is 1,000-fold.' Early reports pointed to an enormously successful event. The Jerusalem Post on Monday said that Shapiro-Murray was the hottest ticket in town, with fans 'scrambling for scalped seats,' likening it to a Taylor Swift concert. 'Trying one more time. Looking for one ticket to the Ben Shapiro/Douglas Murray event in Jerusalem Tuesday evening. Willing to pay well over face value. Please DM [direct message] me,' posted a member of Secret Jerusalem, an online community of Jerusalemites. Several Knesset members also attended the event, including Amichai Chikli, Amihai Eliyahu, Dan Illouz, Ohad Tal, Ariel Kellner and Simcha Rothman. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro speaks at the Freedom of Zion Conference at the International Convention Center in Jerusalem, Nov. 19, 2024. Photo by Yaakov Nachumi/Herut Center. Murray and Shapiro are renowned in conservative circles. Shapiro, an American Jew, is host of a daily political podcast, and founder of media company The Daily Wire. He frequently speaks on college campuses and is the author of numerous books, including, 'Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans' and 'The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great.' Murray, who is from the United Kingdom, first came to prominence with his 2017 book, 'The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam,' in which he warned that Europe could not survive mass Muslim migration and its loss of faith in its 'beliefs, traditions, and legitimacy.' An outspoken defender of Israel prior to the Hamas invasion, Murray ramped up his efforts in columns and TV appearances in its wake. While pro-Israel conservatives may have difficulty picking favorites between the two, it was clear from the audience reaction that Murray was the star of the evening, due perhaps to the fact that he is not Jewish and rushed to Gaza’s front lines at the outset of the war. 'For Israelis in general, you’ve become a symbol over the last year,' said Maj. (res.) Doron Spielman, the IDF’s English-language spokesman, during a one-on-one dialogue with Murray at the conference. Spielman noted that when he and Murray had entered the Gaza Strip a few weeks after the Oct. 7, 2023 attack, soldiers on break skipped the few hours’ sleep provided to them to stand in line to meet the journalist. 'They just wanted to get a hug from you and a picture with you to send to their family,' said Spielman. 'At what point did you decide to stand in the line of fire for the State of Israel and the Jewish people?' he asked. Murray attributed it to both intellectual and emotional reasons, suggesting a good deal of it was due to his upbringing and the values he was taught, such as distinguishing between right and wrong, admiring courage and not viewing victimhood as a virtue, an idea he said was today infecting most of the West. Murray also said he felt it was wildly unjust how Israel is treated abroad, particularly since the Hamas invasion, which cast into sharp relief how the Jewish nation is 'the only nation in the world which, when it gets attacked, then gets attacked again.' His connection to Israel has 'become personal,' he confessed. 'When I read about something terrible happening here, it affects me personally, as if it’s family.' Murray stressed that Israel must maintain its strength, noting that history shows that the most dangerous time for Jews is when they are 'prominent and weak.' He dismissed as impossible the idea that Jews could avoid prominence, keep their heads down and not stand out. There’s only 'one option,' for Israel, that is to be 'prominent and strong,' he said, to a rousing cheer from the audience. Conservative commentator Douglas Murray at the Freedom of Zion Conference at the International Convention Center in Jerusalem, Nov. 19. 2024. Photo by Yaakov Nachumi/Herut Center. Significant time was given over for audience questions. A line quickly formed along the entire length of the hall. Asked about the American Jewish vote, a majority of which still went to Democrats, a questioner wondered what could be done to break Jews of their left-wing leanings. Murray expressed optimism, saying that a shift away from the Democrats was already taking place. He noted that while living in Israel for most of the last year, he had had a chance to meet Diaspora Jewish delegations. T hey would say to him, particularly American Jews, that while they lent support to the MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, 'no one’s been there for me.' 'I started to realize the only thing I could say was, ‘Well, welcome,’ by which I meant, ‘Welcome to the real world.’ It was always going to be like that. This was never going to be reciprocated,' he said. Responding to a question about the existential threat posed to Israel by Iran, Murray suggested the goal should be regime change. History books will show that two journeys in the 20th century should never have been allowed to continue, he said. The first is the train from Zurich that started Vladimir Lenin’s journey back to Russia. The second is the plane that carried the first leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, back to Tehran. 'My hope is that whatever the Israeli military and political leadership can do, the endgame should be that the virus that has ruined Iran … is gone,' Murray said. Murray was presented with a Freedom of Zion Award at the event. 'We want you to know that we understand that you are fighting our war and that this is just a small token to remind you that we know that you are part of our battle,' said Spielman. Amiad Cohen, founder and CEO of the Herut Center for Israeli Liberty, the organizer of the event, presented the award to Murray. 'There’s no word in English that I found in the dictionary for ‘hakarat haTov,’ [‘acknowledging the good’] we’re in real debt for your support as a nation,' he said. The Herut Center, which promotes conservative ideas in Israeli public discourse, seeks to craft a conservative agenda for Israeli public affairs and introduce Israelis to the intellectual underpinnings of conservative thought, translating into Hebrew the books of famous conservative thinkers. Hebrew versions of Murray’s and Shapiro’s books were available at the conference. Cohen said that Murray and Shapiro were a natural fit for the Herut Center. 'The two are both strong conservatives who believe in peace through strength and total victory in the war. And it’s obvious that these two supporters of Israel should be recognized,' he told JNS. 'The war is not only a war for Israel, but it’s the war for the West, for the moral argument for the West,' he added, describing the Hamas attack as a litmus test separating those standing with Israel and 'the right side of history' from those on the side of Hamas and 'evil.' Murray and Shapiro are the 'right people at the right time' to bring this message before the Israeli people, Cohen said. 'That’s why I invited them. It’s totally part of the conservative movement worldwide, and Israel definitely, after the Trump victory.' In a 20-minute speech to the conference, Shapiro stressed the point that Israel’s fight is a fight for the West, depicting the Jewish state as a last bastion of values that were the foundation for Western success. Israel’s economic and military success and its high birth rate are a result of traditional Western values, which makes Israel’s success so vital for Western civilization’s continued success, he said. 'You are an outpost of Western civilization,' he said. 'This is the tip of the spear in a civilizational battle. It’s why everyone cares so much and it’s why you don’t have a choice as to whether to succeed. You have a duty to succeed … Because as you go, Western civilization goes,' he added. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro speaks at the Freedom of Zion Conference at the Binyanei Ha’Uma in Jerusalem, Nov. 19, 2024. Photo by Yaakov Nachumi/Herut Center. Shapiro spoke of an Israeli soldier he had recently met. Ari, 22, was badly wounded in Gaza, losing two limbs. Wheelchair-bound, Ari had thanked Shapiro for his efforts on behalf of Israel and then astonished him by asking, 'I just have a quick question. I want to know what more can I do.' 'That’s an ethos that needs to be carried forward, not just on behalf of Israel, not just on behalf of Jews who live abroad, like me, but on behalf of Americans, on behalf of the West,' said Shapiro. Shapiro lavished praise on Israel for the way it fought back after the tragedy of Oct. 7, noting that 'a country that seemed to be fraying at every corner proved more durable and stronger than the social fabric of pretty much any other nation on the planet.' He also offered constructive criticism, calling on Israel to free itself of unnecessary bureaucracy, calling it a relic of the country’s socialist past, to pave the way toward greater economic and military strength. He called for all Israelis to take an equal share in military service, a reference to the hot-button issue in Israel of haredi, or ultra-Orthodox Jews refusing to serve. Speaking of Israel’s efforts to convince the world of the rightness of its cause, Shapiro said these efforts have failed because Israel’s enemies hate it precisely for its success and for being in the right. 'The world of moral persuasion is not where Israel is going to guarantee its future. The world of independence and strength is where Israel always has and always will guarantee its future,' he said. At the conference, awards were also handed out to soldiers fresh from the front. Shortly before coming to the stage, Murray met two of them. 'You are the tip of the spear for the entire free world,' he told the reservists, who had only hours before been fighting in Lebanon.

Israel sanctions dozens of clients of Hezbollah’s banking network	AQAH, often referred to as Hezbollah’s 'bank,' is technically a charitable association. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Defense Ministry announced sanctions on dozens of clients of the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, a network of unofficial banks used by Hezbollah to both raise and launder money, on Thursday. 'We will lay our hands on all those who support terror, on every front and with every means,' said Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement, saying the move’s goal was to 'collapse the terror networks and hit those who provide them economic oxygen.' The ministry did not name the targeted entities, but said 'deposited significant amounts with the association, which directly funds the activities of the declared terror organization Hezbollah.' The ministry said money deposited with the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association (AQAH) is used to purchase weapons and pay the salaries of Hezbollah terrorists, among other things. Israeli airstrikes targeted 20 of AQAH’s 34 branches in key Hezbollah strongholds, including Beirut, Tyre, Sidon and Baalbek on Oct. 20. In comments to The Press Service of Israel after the strikes, one senior figure in the Israeli intelligence community described AQAH as 'one of the largest centers of economic power for the Iranian proxy.' She also suggested that its competition with the Lebanese banking sector contributed to the country’s economic instability, while Hezbollah benefitted from a parallel, unregulated financial system. AQAH, often referred to as Hezbollah’s 'bank,' is technically a charitable association. Established in 1982, AQAH expanded significantly to 34 branches against the backdrop of Lebanon’s economic crisis. It specializes in providing microloans to Lebanon’s Shiite community, which predominantly supports Hezbollah. These loans serve various needs, from wedding expenses to agricultural development and solar energy farms. By further financing hospitals, schools, housing and other Hezbollah social services in areas where traditional banking services are inaccessible or distrusted, AQAH bolstered Hezbollah’s ability to act as a 'state within a state.' According to Israeli officials, AQAH is believed to handle approximately $500 million in transactions each year, with a total turnover of $3.5 billion recorded before 2019. The group’s financial activities have drawn scrutiny due to suspected connections with Iran, which is a major financier of Hezbollah. In addition to providing loans, the bank allegedly serves as a means of laundering funds for terrorism-related activities. The U.S. Treasury Dept. sanctioned AQAH in 2007. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hezbollah rocket barrage hits park in northern Israel, killing on...	Lebanese terrorists fire 10 rockets at northwestern Israel, with one direct hit scored on public park in Nahariya, killing an Israeli man. By World Israel News Staff One person was killed and two more were injured in the northern Israeli city of Nahariya, after Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon launched a barrage of rockets towards the Western Galilee Thursday afternoon. At least ten rocket launches were detected at approximately 12:00 p.m. Thursday, the IDF said, with one projectile striking a public park in Nahariya. According to an army spokesperson, most of the ten rockets were either intercepted by Israel's missile defense network, or landed in open areas. A man in his 30s was hit by shrapnel from the rocket which struck Nahariya, leaving him fatally wounded, paramedics said. Emergency first responders from United Hatzalah and Magen David Adom were dispatched to the scene to treat the man, but were unable to revive him. 'Witnesses told us that the victim was struck by shrapnel that landed in a public park,' said Barak Lavi, a United Hatzalah medic who responded to the attack. 'Unfortunately, due to the severe nature of his injuries, there was nothing more we could do.' MDA first responders said the victim was declared dead at the scene. 'We arrived at an open area near a playground and found a man in his 30s lying unconscious with shrapnel wounds to his body,' MDA medic Dor Vaknin said. 'We performed medical checks, but he showed no signs of life and we were forced to pronounce him dead.' This is the fourth fatality reported in Hezbollah attacks on Nahariya in the past month. Two other victims, a 40-year-old woman and a 44-year-old woman, were lightly injured from blast-related injuries and cuts from glass fragments in Thursday's rocket attack, MDA said, while six others were treated for shock.

Israel Aerospace Industries reports most profitable year in its h...	International demand for Israel’s military technology has surged as European countries increased their defense budgets in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel Aerospace Industries reported a record-breaking order backlog of approximately $25 billion and a 74% increase in net income in its third-quarter earnings report released on Thursday. 'During this time, we have achieved unprecedented milestones, not just in technological and business terms but as a testament to our commitment to excellence,' said IAI chairman Amir Peretz. Net income for the nine months ending September 30 rose sharply to $416 million, up from $239 million in the same period last year, making it the most profitable period in the state-owned company’s history. For the third quarter alone, net income increased to $122 million, a significant rise from $74 million in Q3 2023. The growth was driven by IAI’s Missile and Space Systems Division, with $1.87 billion in sales for the first nine months of 2024, up from $1.63 billion in 2023. The Arrow missile system earned global acclaim, supported by increased R&D investment of $81 million in Q3, up from $65 million. IAI also reported a record-breaking $25 billion order backlog as of September 30, 2024. This represents a $7.22 billion increase from the previous year and secures 3.5 years of operations at current sales volumes. International demand for Israel’s military technology has surged as European countries increased their defense budgets in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Israel is developing a multilayered aerial defense system that has drawn global attention. The Arrow-3 system, which is designed to intercept ballistic missiles, had its first operational success when it shot down a ballistic missile fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen in November. It is widely believed to be the first time a missile was intercepted in outer space, but Israeli officials have not confirmed this. Operating income during the nine months grew to $431 million, up from $292 million in 2023. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the nine-month period reached $646 million, a 33% increase year-over-year, while gross profit for the third quarter climbed 25% to $282 million, reflecting an 18% profit margin. The company’s sales also rose, reaching $4.39 billion for the nine-month period, a 13% increase from $3.87 billion in the previous year. Third-quarter sales alone totaled $1.54 billion, up 16% from Q3 2023. This growth was driven by increased demand across all business divisions, with particularly strong performance in the Military and Aviation groups. 'Despite a national crisis, IAI maintained supply chain continuity and expanded its global relationships. Our systems play a critical role in Israel’s defense while strengthening our international standing,' said IAI President and CEO Boaz Levy.

Ceasefire deal is ‘in Israel’s hands’ says Hezbollah as Biden env...	Amos Hochstein arrives in Israel following truce talks in Beirut, as top Hezbollah official says the ball is now in Israel’s court. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Amos Hochstein arrived in Israel Wednesday, following extensive talks with Lebanese and Hezbollah officials in Beirut, as part of a last-ditch effort by the Biden administration to secure a truce between Israel and Hezbollah before the president leaves office on January 20th. Hochstein declared Wednesday that he had made 'additional progress' in talks with Nabih Berri, speaker of the Lebanese parliament and a leader of Amal, a Shi’ite movement with ties to Hezbollah. Berri has served as an interlocutor for Hezbollah in talks with Hochstein. 'The meeting today built on the meeting yesterday, and made additional progress,' Hochstein said. 'So I will travel from here in a couple of hours to Israel to try to bring this to a close if we can.' This week’s talks have yielded a 'real opportunity' to reach a deal, Hochstein added. According to Axios, Hochstein was slated to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday morning, after having met with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer Wednesday evening. Hezbollah secretary-general Naim Qassem, successor to Hassan Nasrallah, appeared to signal his group’s support for the American draft proposal for a ceasefire, saying Wednesday that a truce is 'in Israel’s hands.' In a televised address, Qassem said Hezbollah had presented its 'comments' on the American proposal to Hochstein via Berri, signaling its willingness to cooperate in the 'indirect negotiations' with Israel. 'These comments were presented to the US envoy and they were discussed with him in detail,' Qassem said. 'The comments we presented show that we approve this track of indirect negotiations through Speaker Berri.' Qassem rejected Israel’s demand that Israel retain the right to operate militarily in Lebanon should Hezbollah abrogate the ceasefire. The U.S. draft proposal presented to Lebanese officials and Hezbollah earlier this month focuses on three main points: the disarming of Hezbollah forces both north and south of the Litani River; the formation of an international committee headed by an American general to oversee the implementation of the ceasefire; and Israel’s right to respond military in Lebanon should Hezbollah violate the truce – but only after the committee has exhausted attempts to restore the peace.

Israeli commando killed in building collapse in Lebanon	Three soldiers have been killed in the last two days while fighting Hezbollah. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A soldier in a reserve unit of the IDF’s elite Maglan commandos was killed Wednesday when a building collapsed on him in a village in southern Lebanon. Sgt. First Class Eitan Ben Ami, 22, was walking with his comrades through the structure during an active operation, using its cover to protect themselves. Along with others in the area, the building had been damaged by earlier Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire in advance of the military maneuvers. The initial IDF investigation showed that its sudden collapse was due to the weather conditions, rather than any hidden bombs that might have been detonated by Hezbollah forces, or active fire directed at the building. There had just been a heavy rainfall on the previous night. Four soldiers were injured in the incident and were taken to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya for treatment as the unit worked for hours to extract Ben Ami’s body from the ruins. The army said it was studying the incident in order to draw operational conclusions for the future. Ben Ami was a native of Jerusalem. Another resident of the capital, Sgt. First Class (res.) Omer Moshe Gaeldor, 30, was killed the previous day in southern Lebanon. A fighter in the 5111th Reconnaissance Battalion of the Golani Brigade, he was killed by a Hezbollah drone strike while his group was securing an area about two kilometers from the Israeli border. Three soldiers were seriously injured when the explosive drone hit, and they were all airlifted to hospital. Gaeldor, 30, was a cancer survivor and was thus not called up to serve but went anyway, his brother Nitzan said. 'He recovered from cancer two years ago and didn't have to enlist,' he told Kan’s Reshet Bet. 'The mutual decision made by him and his wife, Adi, for him to volunteer and go to the reserves was some kind of comfort, because he believed in what he was doing. He didn't hesitate and enlisted himself on October 7th.' Gaeldor had spent 'more than 250 days' on duty, Nitzan added, even though 'he didn't enjoy being in the army. We're not a military family and neither was he. But the necessity to change reality for the good of all called him.' Gaeldor is survived by his parents, wife, and two young children, eight-month-old Alouma and 3-year-old Neta. Thursday morning, the army announced the name of the Golani soldier who had been killed in battle Wednesday in Lebanon alongside a civilian, Ze’ev 'Jabo' Hanoch Erlich, a 71-year-old tour guide known for his deep knowledge of Israeli history and archeology. Sgt. Gur Kehati (20) from Nir Banim was killed and two officers wounded, including the Golani Brigade's chief of staff, Col. Yoav Yarom, when two Hezbollah fighters opened fire at the group from close range. Ehrlich, who held the rank of major in the IDF reserves, had been brought to the combat unit by an officer who had not asked for permission to do so from his commanders. Kehati is the 803rd soldier to fall since the Hamas invasion 13 months ago set off the ongoing war, and the 46th since Israel invaded southern Lebanon in October to stop Hezbollah’s constant rocket and UAV attacks on the Jewish state in support of Hamas.

UN a ‘den of antisemitism’ that betrayed Israel and US, says Trum...	Rep. Elise Stefanik, tapped by Trump to represent the US at the United Nations, castigates the international body, accusing it of serving as a 'den of antisemitism.' By World Israel News Staff A Republican lawmaker nominated by former President and President-elect Donald Trump to represent the United States in the United Nations castigated the international body on Tuesday, calling the UN a 'den of antisemitism.' Rep. Elise Stefanik, 40, who currently represents New York's 21st congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives, has been tapped by Trump to replace Linda Thomas-Greenfield as American Ambassador to the UN, addressed an annual awards dinner held by the Endowment for Middle East Truth (EMET) in Washington D.C. Tuesday evening. During her speech, Stefanik, chairwoman of the Republican Conference in the House of Representatives, accused the UN of betraying both Israel and the U.S., while serving as an 'apologist' for Tehran and its terrorist proxies. 'Even before the barbaric terrorist attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7, the U.N. has continuously betrayed Israel and betrayed America, acting as an apologist for Iran and their terrorist proxies,' Stefanik said. 'You have my commitment, as I have led this fight in Congress against vile antisemitism, I will stand up for President Trump’s America-first, peace-through-strength policies and bring moral truth and crystal-clear moral clarity at the United Nations on day one.' Stefanik referenced the 101 captives still held hostage in the Gaza Strip, including seven with American citizenship, calling their return a top priority. 'There are still over 100 hostages, including seven Americans, being held by Hamas,' Stefanik continued. 'We must not stop, and we will not stop until every hostage is brought home.' Citing examples of the UN's misconduct regarding Israel and Iranian proxy forces, Stefanik noted the ties between the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and Gaza terror groups including Hamas, and the agency's continued unquestioning reliance on Hamas casualty figures in the ongoing Gaza war. Stefanik claimed that had Trump been in office last year, 'October 7th would never have happened,' and vowed to 'stand up for' Trump's 'America First, peace through strength policies and bring moral truth and crystal clear moral clarity at the United Nations on Day One.' The State of Israel, she added 'is a miracle,' calling the Jewish state 'foundational to the United States.'

Shin Bet, police thwart Ben-Gvir assassination plot	Three Palestinian men reportedly consulted with Hamas, Hezbollah regarding how to murder National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. By World Israel News Staff Three Palestinians who plotted to assassinate National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir were arrested, the Shin Bet intelligence agency and Israeli police said in a joint media statement on Thursday morning. According to the security forces, the men, all residents of Hebron, established a terror cell and planned to murder Ben-Gvir. The minister has often advocated for harsh punishments against Arab terrorists, including the death penalty. His tough stance on terror has resulted in numerous threats to his life. According to the indictment filed in a military court earlier this week, the men reportedly consulted with the Hamas and Hezbollah regarding their strategy and sought material support for the plot from the terror groups. The ringleader of the plot, named as Ismail Ibrahim Awadi, reached out to various sources in June 2024 in an attempt to procure weapons for the assassination. Awadi gathered intelligence regarding Ben-Gvir's frequent travel routes to and from his home in a Jewish enclave within Hebron. He also learned which vehicles are used by the minister and his eldest son, and how many bodyguards typically accompanied them. The cell weighed different options regarding the location of the assassination, and considered murdering Ben-Gvir when he traveled to the scene of a terror attack to speak with survivors, as he often does. 'I extend my gratitude to the Judea and Samaria District Police and the Shin Bet for their dedication in apprehending and prosecuting the terrorist cell that planned to assassinate me and my son Shuvael,' Ben-Gvir said in a media statement after news of the arrests were made public. 'Thanks to their relentless efforts and, by the grace of God, another attempt by the enemy to harm me and my family has been thwarted,' he added. 'I remain committed to toughening prison conditions for terrorists, strengthening Israeli sovereignty and governance, distributing weapons for self-defense, demolishing illegal structures, and achieving a decisive victory over our enemies. No terrorist will deter me.'

Civilian scholar killed during unauthorized Lebanon visit with ID...	Ze'ev 'Jabo' Erlich, 71, was a prominent researcher of Israeli geography and legendary Judea and Samaria tour guide. By World Israel News Staff A 71-year-old Israeli civilian was killed by Hezbollah gunfire in southern Lebanon on Wednesday, after he entered the combat zone alongside an IDF unit, without official authorization from the army to do so. Ze'ev 'Jabo' Hanoch Erlich, a prominent researcher and scholar of Israeli geography, accompanied a Golani Brigade unit to an ancient archaeological site near Tyre. Hebrew-language media reported that Erlich did not receive the necessary permission from the army to enter southern Lebanon as a civilian. Despite not being an active-duty soldier, Erlich was apparently provided a gun, helmet, and military uniform. According to Channel 12 News, Erlich was shot dead by Hezbollah terrorists at the Shrine of the Prophet Shimon in the village of Shama. A Golani Brigade soldier, whose name has not been made public, was also killed in the incident. Golani Brigade Chief of Staff Brig. Gen. Yoav Yarom, ,a close friend of Erlich, was reported to have been seriously wounded. Preliminary findings from an ongoing military investigation indicated that Erlich likely visited Lebanon on several prior occasions in recent weeks, alongside IDF troops. Although Erlich entered Lebanon without the proper authorization and not as a soldier, the army made the unusual decision to posthumously recognize him as a fallen soldier. That makes Erlich, at 71, the oldest soldier to be killed in battle since the October 7th war began, and possibly the oldest in Israeli history. In order for a civilian to embed with IDF troops and tour southern Lebanon, IDF senior officials, such as regional commanders, must grant specific permission for their entry. That permission is typically reserved for members of the Knesset, foreign dignitaries, and journalists. Erlich, who was one of the founders of the Jewish community of Ofra in Samaria, is survived by his wife and six children. 'It’s hard to fathom the immense tragedy of losing our dear friend Ze’ev ‘Jabo’ Erlich. Jabo was one of the founding figures in the field of tour guiding and the study of Judea and Samaria. Our generation followed his lead, hanging on his every word,' Yaron Rosenthal, head of the Gush Etzion Regional Council and a friend of Erlich, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'For years, he guided and researched with unparalleled curiosity, exploring every nook and cranny and investigating every archaeological site. Few people had such a profound passion for the land and loved it as deeply as he did. To me, Jabo was also a dear friend and a mentor from whom I learned so much over the years. I will miss him deeply. We will do our best to follow in the footsteps of the giant he was.'
