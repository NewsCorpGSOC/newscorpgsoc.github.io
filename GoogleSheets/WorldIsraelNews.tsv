‘Temple Mount is Muslim-only property,’ Palestinian Authority chi...	The head of the Palestinian Authority also said that Israel doesn’t deserve membership in the world body, as he nods to anti-Israel protesters in America, saying 'we are grateful' to them. By Mike Wagenheim, JNS In an address to the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday morning, Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas called the holiest Jewish site—the Temple Mount in Jerusalem—the 'exclusive property of Muslims' and referred to Israel as a 'terrorist state' that does not deserve membership in the United Nations. Abbas, whose presidential mandate expired in 2009–the last time P.A. elections were held–told those watching that 'the world is responsible' for what he asserted were crimes against humanity taking place in the Gaza Strip amid Israel’s defensive war against Hamas. He claimed that Israel 'took advantage of what happened' on Oct. 7, when Hamas launched a massive assault in southern Israel—murdering, raping and torturing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage—to 'launch a genocide' in the Gaza Strip. Abbas also said Israel has just launched a second 'war of genocide' in Lebanon, calling into question what kind of hostilities the Jewish state could be involved in that wouldn’t qualify as one. He also referred to Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir as a terrorist for calling for a Third Temple to be built on the mount. Abbas saved a heavy dose of criticism for the Biden administration. He said he 'regrets' that the White House 'furnished Israel with deadly weapons it used to kill thousands of innocent civilians' while utilizing its veto power in the U.N. Security Council three times to thwart efforts to force a ceasefire on Israel with no guarantee that its hostages would be released from Gaza. 'As long as the U.S. is supporting' Israel, posed Abbas, 'why not keep going?' He also took Washington to task for denying the Palestinians full membership in the United Nations. 'We don’t deserve membership in the eyes of America,' he stated. 'I don’t understand.' Abbas did acknowledge protesters across America who 'are marching in the streets.' Many of them have called for the end of Israel, including its inhabitants, and have expressed explicit support for terror groups; have harassed Jews verbally and physically; and have disrupted Jewish life, including on college campuses. 'We are grateful to them,' said Abbas. He laid out a 12-step laundry list of requests and demands for a 'day-after' scenario, referring to the end of the war against Hamas and end of the terror group’s governance of Gaza. Those measures have all been laid out in one form or another in various public statements by the P.A., the United Nations and other international officials. On that list was 'an end to military aggressions by terrorist settlers' in Judea and Samaria, and eastern Jerusalem. Abbas said he would be submitting a request to the General Assembly regarding what he said was Israel’s lack of qualification to hold U.N. membership. His citation for such a claim was unclear, as he referred to Israel’s acceptance of the 1947 U.N. Partition Plan, but provisions he said Israel has never accepted or implemented. He also said that he would ask the world body to pass a resolution to ensure that Israel does not obstruct a visit by Abbas to the Gaza Strip, which he says he is trying to arrange. Abbas did not fall back on Holocaust denial or revisionism—a staple of previous UNGA speeches. Israel sent what appeared to be a staffer from its U.N. mission to attend the speech. Danny Danon, Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations released a statement, pointing out that Abbas’s 26-minute speech contained no mention of Hamas. 'Since the massacre of Oct. 7, Abbas has failed to condemn Hamas for their crimes against humanity,' Danon wrote. 'The Palestinian Authority under his leadership pays salaries to terrorists who kill Israelis: Whoever kills more, Abbas pays him more. Only when he stands on the U.N. platform does he talk about a peaceful solution.' Danon said the P.A. leader’s legacy 'is one of chronic weakness in the face of terrorism and hatred.'

Trump ally accused of being a Nazi after he changed the price of ...	Whether Lindell realized it or not, $14.88 has been identified as a Nazi symbol. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News When staunch Trump ally Mike Lindell changed the price of his pillow to $14.88, he most likely didn't expect accusations of Nazism to follow. However, white Supremacists on social media began liking his prices, and not because they were low. When Lindell lowered the price of his Standard Classic MyPillow from its usual range of between $29.99 to $49.98 down to $14.88, people began to allege that he was sending a Nazi message. Whether Lindell realized it or not, $14.88 has been identified as a Nazi symbol. The number 14 stands for a white supremacist motto that contains 14 words. David Lane, a member of the white supremacist group The Order, originated the motto: 'We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.' The double eights refer to the fact that 'H' is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and 88 stands for 'Heil Hitler,' both words beginning with 'H.' Lindell's MyPillow ad received 8,000 likes on X and 415 likes on Facebook. Balkanomic reposted their order of the pillows, saying: '$14.88? How could you pass up such a great deal?' An X user called 'Goy division,' whose bio shows white supremacist symbolism (including a Nazi SS-esque lightning bolt and the phrase 'Fourteen words, eighty-eight precepts'), wrote, '6,000,000 positive reviews can't be wrong.' 'Yes, I think we have a deal,' wrote one user who refers to himself as an 'ethnostatesman' and posted a picture of Pepe the Frog, a well-known white supremacist symbol. However, Mike Lindell insists it wasn't his intention to signal white supremacy, and he points out that many items at Walmart are sold for amounts ending in 88 cents. Lindell has often expressed the view that the 2020 election was rigged in favor of Joe Biden, and for his views, his pillow brand has been removed from shelves of Bed, Bath and Beyond, Kohl's, and Walmart. 'When they have a sale on a sale, right? That 88,' he said on FlashPoint, a conservative online talk show. 'I get a call from all the media around the country and the world, all the way to the Daily Mail, saying, what are you, a Nazi?' He added, 'I'm going, 'Who comes up with this stuff?'' When asked if he would change his prices from $14.88, Lindell insisted he wasn't budging. 'It's another attack on MyPillow because their CEO wants to go to paper ballots and counting. It's as simple as that,' he said.

Israeli security forces foil terror plot to bomb Jewish holy site...	Security forces said the actions are 'are even more severe when being carried out by Israeli citizens during wartime.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Shin Bet, Israel's security agency and the police foiled a terrorist plan to bomb Jewish holy sites in the north of Israel last month and to shoot worshippers who prayed there. On Thursday, the agencies announced the arrest of Basel Abahara, a 23-year-old who lives in the Galilee region, and two minors in mid-August. This week, they were indicted for planning terrorist acts and keeping weapons. During interrogations, Abahara admitted that he had been planning to bomb the holy sites and then to shoot Jewish worshippers there. He also said he built the explosives based on advice from contacts in Judea and Samaria. Abahara enlisted the aid of minors to carry out the attack. Shin Bet said the planning of the attack was in the early phases, and they managed to seize communication devices, bomb-making materials, and a military vest. Abahara also admitted to throwing a Molotov cocktail not far from his home. Shin Bet said in a statement that the planning of such an attack was even more severe than usual because it involved 'Israeli citizens during wartime.' 'The Shin Bet and Israel Police treat any involvement of Israeli citizens in activity that endangers the state's and citizens' security with great severity, will continue to operate accordingly under the authority afforded to them, and will use the means at their disposal to thwart threats,' they said. Last Thursday, the IDF and Shin Bet eliminated a terror leader who planned numerous attacks in Northern Samaria. Shadi Zakarneh was killed alongside other terrorists by an IAF strike on his vehicle after Shin Bet saw him traveling in Qabatiya. The strike that killed Zkarneh also eliminated two other terrorists in the vehicle, and a strike on an additional vehicle killed three others. The second vehicle was laden with explosives, and the strike caused multiple blasts.

Macklemore in hot water after ‘F—k America’ rant	While political statements from artists are nothing new, this one seems to have struck a nerve. By Jewish Breaking News What happens in Vegas doesn’t always stay in Vegas, especially when it comes to high-profile festival drama. Last Tuesday, Neon City Festival promoters proudly unveiled their star-studded lineup, with Grammy-winning rapper Macklemore featured among the headliners. By Monday, his name had vanished without a trace, leaving fans and industry insiders scrambling for answers. Neon City organizers have remained tight-lipped, citing only 'unforeseen circumstances' in a public statement for Macklemore’s sudden departure. However, sources close to the festival cited by Digital Music News point to a controversial performance Macklemore gave Saturday night. At a pro-Palestinian benefit concert in Seattle, the 'Thrift Shop' singer let loose with a sharp 'f—k America' during his set. While political statements from artists are nothing new, this one seems to have struck a nerve. The antisemitic rapper himself finally broke his silence yesterday with a lengthy social media post on X. While stopping short of a full apology, Macklemore admitted to getting 'caught in the moment' while performing. 'My thoughts and feelings are not always expressed perfectly or politely,' he wrote. 'Sometimes I slip up and get caught in the moment. Saturday night was one of those times.' 'But do not misconstrue the word ‘f—k’ for the word ‘hate.’ It’s different to be angry than to disown,' Macklemore continued. 'I’ve lost endorsements, I’ve lost business ties. I am still here, unwavering in my support for a Free Palestine.' Out of all the antisemitic A-listers spreading misinformation, Macklemore has been particularly harsh on Israel’s defensive war in Gaza. Just mere weeks after Hamas murdered 1,200 innocents in Israel on October 7, he signed a star-studded open letter calling for a ceasefire without preconditions. In May, he released a protest song titled 'Hind’s Hall,' ironically in support of the same violent campus takeovers being fought by congressional leaders in the Senate this week.

New York Mayor Eric Adams indicted following corruption probe: Re...	The case is likely to complicate any Adams bid for re-election in 2025. By Reuters and The Washington Free Beacon New York City mayor Eric Adams has been indicted after a federal corruption investigation, but the indictment is sealed and it is unclear what charges he will face, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The charges come after the FBI last November searched Adams' electronic devices, and in the wake of a slew of resignations by top city officials in recent weeks as multiple federal corruption investigations entangle his administration. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the charges, declined to comment. Adams' lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One of his lawyers has said that the mayor, a Democrat, was cooperating with an investigation but did not say what it was about. The case is likely to complicate any Adams bid for re-election in 2025. Other Democratic politicians, including New York City comptroller Brad Lander, plan to challenge Adams—once a key ally of President Joe Biden—for the party's nomination. The Times, citing a search warrant, reported in early November 2023 that federal authorities were investigating the possible acceptance by Adams' 2021 campaign of illegal donations, including by the Turkish government. The probe, conducted by the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, focused on whether Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign conspired with a Brooklyn construction company to funnel foreign money into the campaign through a straw-donor scheme, the Times said. Authorities have also sought information about Adams' interactions with Israel, China, Qatar, South Korea and Uzbekistan, according to the Times.

Nasrallah’s dilemma: A crisis of strategic choices	Despite the setbacks, Nasrallah shows no sign of backing down from his support of Hamas. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is at a critical crossroads. Will he back down from fighting, or risk an Israeli invasion of Lebanon? His decision will come amid the loss of numerous key Hezbollah leaders in airstrikes, the shocking attack on the terror group’s communication devices, and the demands of his Iranian patrons. This crisis is compounded by an unprecedented wave of displacement — nearly half a million Lebanese fleeing Hezbollah strongholds in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley. Thousands of Lebanese are staying in makeshift shelters while at least 5,000 have crossed into neighboring Syria. Exacerbating Nasrallah’s troubles, the displaced Lebanese are now largely dependent on international aid and may become a bargaining chip in future negotiations. On the political front, Hezbollah’s leadership appears fragmented, with reports of internal discord between the organization’s leadership and its southern military command. Nasrallah banked on the international community pressuring Israel to quickly end its war with Hamas. He expected his pre-October 7 arsenal of an estimated 200,000 rockets to deter Israel. Instead, the fighting in Gaza is approaching its first anniversary. Nasrallah has not provided Hamas with any meaningful support. The elite Radwan Force is in disarray. The sabotage of thousands of communications devices has made Hezbollah a source of ridicule. And a ground war in Lebanon is looking increasingly likely. Hezbollah figures are increasingly resorting to the rhetoric of martyrdom, indicating a growing sense of desperation. Despite the setbacks, Nasrallah shows no sign of backing down from his support of Hamas. Hezbollah still maintains significant firepower, but Iran is currently restraining Hezbollah. It is believed Iran will intervene if Hezbollah’s situation deteriorates. Tehran has invested far more in Hezbollah than Hamas. Around 63,500 residents of northern Israel were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. The terror group has launched more than 9,300 rockets and drones, killing 49 people on the Israeli side. Israel has defeated Hamas enough that it is now turning its attention to safely bringing its evacuees home. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon — from all locations south of the Litani River — in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War. Nasrallah can back down, sparing Lebanon from a destructive war, but lose his credibility as a leader in Iran’s so-called 'Axis of Resistance.' Or Nasrallah can fight to the end and sacrifice Lebanese lives.

Israeli airstrike kills terrorist brothers who participated in Oc...	The IDF added that forces in the Rafah area of southern Gaza have killed 15 terrorists in the last day. By Pesach Benson, TPS Two brothers who participated in Hamas’s October 7 massacre were eliminated in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday. The IDF said Suleiman Abu-Lafi and his brother, Abdullah were killed in Rafah last week. According to the army, Suleiman smuggled weapons. From Gaza he managed to direct terror attacks in Judea and Samaria. Abdullah was a member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Both participated in the October 7 attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border. A separate airstrike killed another commander of Hamas’s Nukhba Force who also participated in the October 7 massacre. The IDF added that forces in the Rafah area of southern Gaza have killed 15 terrorists in the last day. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

30,000 Jewish visitors to make Rosh Hashanah pilgrimage to Ukrain...	Earlier this month, Ukraine warned Hasidic Jews to forgo this year’s pilgrimage to Uman due to the war with Russia. By The Algemeiner Some 30,000 Hasidic Jews will reportedly go on this year’s annual Rosh Hashanah pilgrimage to the Ukrainian city of Uman to visit the tomb of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, the revered founder of the Breslover Hasidim. An Israeli diplomat had told The Times of Israel that the number of worshipers this year could reach a record 50,000. However, due to flight cancellations caused by escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terrorist organization in Lebanon, thousands of pilgrims will not be able to make the trip, according to the Ukrainian News Agency. Citing the United Jewish Community of Ukraine and the Historical and Cultural Center of Uman charitable foundation, the news agency reported on the lower-than-expected attendance. 'This year, due to the escalation in the north of Israel, a number of airlines canceled the flights that the Hasidic pilgrims were supposed to use to reach European countries in order to get to Ukraine,' the charitable foundation said in a message. 'Although the interested parties are looking for a way out of this situation, a significant part of the thousands of pilgrims who want to get to Uman will not be able to do so.' Each year, tens of thousands of Jewish pilgrims visit Uman, a major pilgrimage site for Hasidic Jews to pray at Nachman’s tomb on the occasion of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, which will take place next week. Up to 500 Hasidim had already arrived in Uman as of last week, with a mass arrival of pilgrims expected in the coming days, according to the State Migration Service of Ukraine. Since 2020, Ukrainian officials have warned against making the pilgrimage, first due to COVID-19 and then because of the war with Russia. The pilgrimage became more complicated when many commercial flights to Ukraine were suspended following Russia’s invasion of the country in 2022. Earlier this month, Ukraine warned Hasidic Jews to forgo this year’s pilgrimage to Uman due to the war with Russia. 'Russia’s ongoing full-scale military aggression against Ukraine poses real threats to people’s lives and safety, [making] it impossible to guarantee the safety of foreign citizens on the territory of Ukraine,' the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Kyiv added that there is a 'legal regime of martial law which provides for a number of additional regulations, including restrictions on freedom of movement, a curfew and enhanced patrols, a ban on holding mass events and gatherings, as well as the application of coercive measures against persons who will not comply with the established restrictions.' Therefore, the ministry wrote, Ukraine 'urges Hasidic pilgrims to refrain from this year’s pilgrimage to Uman as part of the celebration of Rosh Hashanah.' The statement went on to say that due to the war, there are not enough bomb shelters or medical personnel in Uman, and the transportation infrastructure has been compromised due to shelling. The foreign ministry’s warning came two days after the governor of the region where Uman is located issued a similar statement to Jewish worshipers ahead of Rosh Hashanah. Like the ministry, Cherkasy Region head Igor Taburets did not say that the pilgrims would be prevented from coming but asked them not to make the trip. Nonetheless, local authorities were preparing for the pilgrimage with enhanced security measures, according to Taburets. Earlier this month, Moldova said it would not allow pilgrims to pass through the country on the way to Uman, citing security costs and the limited capacity of their facilities. Some 20,000 pilgrims used Chisinau airport last year to get to Ukraine. An alternative route into Uman has been prepared through Romania. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke about preparations for the pilgrimage last month. The United States recently issued a travel warning for Uman, urging American citizens not to visit the city due to the security situation. Uman has been targeted by Russian forces on several occasions during the ongoing war. Last April, at least 20 people, including three children, were killed during a missile and drone barrage launched by the Russians. Located in the south of Ukraine in the Cherkasy region, Uman was once home to a thriving Jewish community. In 1941, however, the Nazis deported the city’s entire Jewish community, murdering 17,000 Jews and destroying the local Jewish cemetery — including Nachman’s grave, which was later recovered and relocated. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, several Jewish Orthodox families have moved to Uman. Last year, more than 35,000 worshipers celebrated Rosh Hashanah at the grave of Nachman, despite Ukrainian authorities issuing similar warnings as they are now about visiting the city amid war with Russia.

Mayim Bialik expresses solidarity with Israelis in rocket-attacke...	She added that her ancestor was 'a Zionist visionary, a gifted poet, and a lover of Israel.' By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Jewish actress and neuroscientist Mayim Bialik shared on Tuesday a message of support for residents of Kiryat Bialik, a northern city in Israel named after her great-great-grandfather’s cousin, after it was hit with heavy rocket fire this past weekend from the Lebanese Hezbollah terrorist group. 'You may have seen that Iran-backed Hezbollah hit Kiryat Bialik this weekend,' the former 'The Big Bang Theory' star wrote in an Instagram post. 'Thousands of rockets have been fired upon Israel by Hezbollah over the last year, and the situation in the north is intensifying in terrifying ways … My heart is with all the innocent civilians of Kiryat Bialik.' The city was named after Israel’s national poet laureate Haim Nahman Bialik, who is related to the actress. He died in 1934 of a heart attack at the age of 61 in Vienna, Austria. Bialik House, his former home in Tel Aviv, has been converted to a museum dedicated to the poet and his work. Most major cities in Israel also have a street named after him, Bialik noted in her Instagram post. She added that her ancestor was 'a Zionist visionary, a gifted poet, and a lover of Israel.' Hezbollah launched more than 100 rockets and drones at northern Israel over the weekend and three people suffered shrapnel wounds. Bialik was honored with the Ambassadors for Peace award on Tuesday night at a gala hosted by Creative Community for Peace (CCFP), a nonprofit organization comprised of members of the entertainment industry who have the shared goal of combating antisemitism and the cultural boycott of Israel while using the arts to promote peace. Upon accepting the award at the CCFP gala on Tuesday night, Bialik spoke about 'feeling overwhelmed' since the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre that took place in southern Israel. 'I took my oldest son to college this week as my family is sleeping in bomb shelters in Israel. That contrast is what many of us are feeling for this entire year,' she said. 'CCFP was founded over a decade ago but I do admit that it wasn’t until Oct. 7 that the work of CCFP became an integral part of my daily life. I want to thank everyone at CCFP for the support that has given me the ability to stand strong in the face of intimidation, threats, hatred, and ignorance.'

IDF strike in Beirut kills top Hezbollah aerial commander	The slain terrorist joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and served in a variety of positions, including as the commander of the surface-to-air missile unit and the 'Aziz' unit. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces on Thursday killed the head of Hezbollah’s aerial forces in an airstrike in Beirut’s Dahiyeh district. Senior Hezbollah terrorist Muhammad Hossein Sarur commanded numerous attacks with 'drone, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles launched at the Israeli home front,' the IDF stated. Sarur was also a drone production 'project leader' in Lebanon, who established sites to build explosives and intelligence-gathering drones, 'including some located under civilian buildings in Beirut and other areas in Lebanon,' the Israeli army said. היום, 26 בספטמבר 2024, בהכוונה מודיעינית מדוייקת של חיל האוויר ואגף המודיעין, מטוסי קרב תקפו בביירות וחיסלו את מחמד חסין סרור, מפקד היחידה האווירית של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה>> pic.twitter.com/9btewwdOwE &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) September 26, 2024 The slain terrorist joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and served in a variety of positions, including as the commander of the surface-to-air missile unit and the 'Aziz' unit, responsible for terror operations on Lebanon’s southern border with the Jewish state. Sarur also served as the Iranian-backed terrorist organization’s envoy to the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Lebanon’s Al Mayadeen televisoin channel, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported that four people were killed in the Israeli airstrike. Two Lebanese 'security sources' confirmed that Sarur, also known as Abu Saleh, was among the dead, Reuters reported. מרגעי התקיפה בביירות pic.twitter.com/0CPsHLAbLV &mdash; בז news (@1717Bazz) September 26, 2024 'The IDF will continue to undermine the capabilities of the Hezbollah terrorist group and to dismantle the organization’s top command,' the Israeli military stated on Thursday afternoon. Shortly before the IDF announcement, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office released a photo of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approving the assassination during his flight to the United States. On Tuesday, Israeli Air Force jets carried out another strike in Dahiyeh, killing Ibrahim Qubaisi, the commander of Hezbollah’s missile array. That strike came fewer than 24 hours after the attempted assassination of Hezbollah’s No. 3 terrorist commander, Ali Karaki, in the same area. On Friday, the IDF took credit for a airstrike in Dahiyeh that killed more than a dozen senior Hezbollah terrorist officials, including Ibrahim Aqil, whom Washington also wanted for his involvement in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut. Jerusalem has escalated attacks on Hezbollah since adding the return of evacuated Israeli civilians to the north as an official war goal on Sept. 17. Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones. The attacks have killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage. Tens of thousands of Israeli civilians remain displaced internally due to the violence.

Ben-Gvir threatens to freeze role in coalition amid reports of 21...	He added that a truce 'conveys weakness, endangers the security of your citizens, and proves that you do not intend to win.' By JNS Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir vowed on Thursday to suspend his role in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition if Jerusalem agrees to a temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah. If a truce is signed, Ben-Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit Party would 'relieve itself of any commitment to the coalition,' including voting in the Knesset and attending cabinet meetings, the right-wing leader warned. 'The most basic and understandable thing is that when your enemy is on his knees, you do not allow him to recover, but work to defeat him,' Ben-Gvir said. He added that a truce 'conveys weakness, endangers the security of your citizens and proves that you do not intend to win.' Should a temporary ceasefire in Lebanon become permanent 'as part of an ‘outline’ of some sort, all ministers and Knesset members from Otzma Yehudit will resign from the government and coalition,' Ben-Gvir added. The United States, Australia, Canada, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar called jointly on Wednesday evening for an 'immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement.' Minutes before the announcement, U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron released a similar, joint statement. On Thursday, other members of Israel’s coalition government rejected the proposal, which made no mention of Hezbollah terror. Netanyahu has pushed back against reports that Jerusalem was about to agree to the ceasefire terms, saying that 'this is an American-French proposal that the prime minister has not even responded to.' In a call with reporters Wednesday night, two senior U.S. officials said that Israel and Lebanon 'are familiar with the text, and we’ll let them speak with their actions of accepting the deal in the coming hours.' 'I can share that we have had this conversation with the parties and felt this was the right moment to issue the call based on our discussion,' one of the senior officials said. Israel has escalated attacks on Hezbollah since adding the return of evacuated civilians to the north as an official war goal on Sept. 17. Hezbollah has attacked the Jewish state nearly daily since Oct. 8, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones. The attacks have killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage. Tens of thousands of civilians remain internally displaced due to the violence.

Hamas to surrender control of Gaza to Palestinian Authority – rep...	Israeli government has repeatedly rejected the idea, considering the Palestinian Authority a terror supporting entity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hamas has agreed that the Palestinian Authority (PA) can control the Gaza Strip, including the crossings into Israel and Egypt, on the ‘day after’ the war with Israel ends, Saudi news channel Al-Hadath reported Thursday. The channel cited an unnamed Hamas official as its source. Eleven days ago, Osama Hamdan, a member of Hamas’ policy-setting Political Bureau, told AFP that the terror organization wants 'joint Palestinian rule' in Gaza. Referring to a Chinese effort in July to make peace between the PA’s main backer, the nationalist Fatah movement, and the Islamist Hamas, along with 12 other smaller factions, Hamdan added, 'We went to Beijing&#8230;and we agreed to form a national unity government that will run Palestinian affairs in Gaza.' The highlight of the so-called Beijing Declaration was a plan to form an interim reconciliation government to run both Gaza and the PA that would lead eventually to the establishment of a Palestinian state 'with Jerusalem as its capital.' It also declared that the Palestinians had a right to 'resist Israeli occupation.' On Wednesday, PA Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa said that a meeting to sign an agreement would take place in Egypt next week, and that 'everyone' will participate in managing the coastal enclave. Meanwhile, a 'senior PA official' told Ynet Thursday that the PA already controls much of civilian life in Gaza, even without a reconciliation deal. 'The PA manages civil affairs in the Gaza Strip anyway - education, health, the water and energy authority,' the official said. 'For Hamas, this is a headache, so it will hand it over to the PA in order to continue to control security and military [matters]. 'Hamas understands that Israel will not give up control of the crossings from a security point of view, so it will let the PA face Israel,' he added. 'We will wait and see what happens at the meeting in Cairo, but there are not too many expectations for an agreement.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly declared that the PA can play no role in Gaza after the war is over, as its constant anti-Israel rhetoric, lawfare tactics and glorification of terrorists, whether from Fatah or any other Palestinian group, make it no better than Hamas. Despite the government’s agreement with Netanyahu, the Biden administration has consistently pushed the idea of the PA stepping in to rule Gaza on the day after. In August, Channel 12 reported that the PA had presented a plan to the U.S. outlining how it could do so. The report said, however, that the proposal did not include any explanation of how Hamas would be prevented from rebuilding its military strength, or how the PA could block any group from launching rockets again at Israel. It also did not propose solutions for how to prevent smuggling operations under the Egyptian-Gaza border area, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, which Israel has called 'Hamas’ lifeline' for weaponry that Jerusalem insists it can never allow the Palestinians to control again.

Netanyahu departs for New York, denies report of impending truce ...	Israel has yet to respond to American-French proposal for a ceasefire with Hezbollah, Netanyahu says, denying claims by US officials of an impending truce. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday denied reports that his government and the Lebanese terror organization Hezbollah are set to begin a three-week truce within the next few hours. Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, departed via Ben Gurion International Airport before dawn Thursday morning, flying to New York for the prime minister's address to the United Nations General Assembly. The premier, who made no statements to the press before his departure, which was delayed this week following the latest round of fighting between the IDF and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon and a Hezbollah ballistic missile attack on the Tel Aviv area, did release a statement while en route to New York regarding an alleged truce set to go into effect 'in the coming hours.' The prime minister's office issued a statement rebutting claims made by senior U.S. officials, denying that Israel had agreed to the plan, drafted by the Biden administration and the Macron government, for a three-week truce between Israel and Hezbollah. 'The report about a ceasefire is incorrect. This is an American-French proposal that the Prime Minister has not even responded to.' 'The report about the purported directive to ease up on the fighting in the north is the opposite of the truth. The Prime Minister has directed the IDF to continue fighting with full force, according to the plan that was presented to him.' 'The fighting in Gaza will also continue until all the objectives of the war have been achieved.' Earlier on Thursday, Sky News quoted senior American officials who said that a breakthrough had been reached on a ceasefire, and that the truce was set to go into effect within a matter of hours. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid pushed back against the planned three-week ceasefire, saying Israel should only agree to a single-week truce, so as to avoid giving Hezbollah time to regroup after a wave of Israeli attacks. Coalition members and local leaders across northern Israel expressed outrage following the Sky News report, demanding the government continue combat operations against Hezbollah.

Scientists unlock photosynthesis secrets, paving the way for more...	Genetically modifying plants to optimize photosynthesis could lead to higher yields, especially in regions with inconsistent sunlight, poor soil, or challenging climates. By Pesach Benson, TPS An Israeli study of photosynthesis in plants could open new avenues of innovation in agritech and the development of more efficient crops. Photosynthesis is a biochemical process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose, a type of sugar that can be used to fuel their activities. A key byproduct of this process is the release of oxygen from the plant. Between 50-80% of Earth’s oxygen is the result of photosynthesis. It is also responsible for sequestering carbon dioxide, providing the foundation for the planet’s food chain. Scientists at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, led by Dr. Reinat Nevo under the guidance of Professor Ziv Reich, found that photosynthesis adapts to varying levels of sunlight by reorganizing the structure of its chloroplast membranes. The process of photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts, organelles within plant cells that house specialized membranes. These membranes are crucial for facilitating the flow of electrons between proteins, a key aspect of converting solar radiation into usable chemical energy. Until recently, scientists believed that the spatial structure of these membranes posed a challenge to photosynthesis by forcing electrons to travel longer distances between proteins, thereby slowing down the process. However, Nevo’s research team discovered that these membranes are not static. Instead, they shift their organization depending on the amount of available light. The study was recently published in the peer-reviewed Nature Plants journal. Much like how human pupils dilate or constrict in response to light exposure, the membranes in chloroplasts change their alignment when moving between darkness and light. The study found that as plants transition from dark to light conditions, the chloroplast membranes adjust, bringing proteins closer together and shortening the distance that electrons must travel. This realignment helps the photosynthetic process operate more efficiently under different light intensities. The ability of chloroplast membranes to reorganize themselves ensures that plants can optimize energy use, regardless of fluctuating sunlight. To uncover these findings, Nevo’s team used cutting-edge technology, including cryo-scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, to observe chloroplast membranes in both light and darkness. Contrary to previous assumptions, the study revealed that while the proteins themselves did not change position, the spatial arrangement of the membranes did. This shift in membrane alignment plays a vital role in regulating the distance between proteins, facilitating a faster and more efficient photosynthesis process. One reason for this dynamic adjustment is to protect the plant. Under low-light conditions or during nighttime, photosynthesis is minimal. In these situations, the membranes distance themselves, isolating proteins and preventing them from being overstimulated by weak light, which could potentially damage them. Building on this discovery, the research team conducted an experiment using genetically modified plants. In one group, the plants’ chloroplast membranes were locked in the 'light mode,' keeping the proteins close together even in darkness. In another group, the membranes remained perpetually in 'dark mode,' with proteins spaced further apart. The results were striking: plants with the locked light-mode configuration grew larger and exhibited higher rates of photosynthesis compared to those in dark mode. These findings suggest a promising future for genetically engineered crops designed to optimize photosynthesis. By manipulating the spatial structure of chloroplast membranes, plants could potentially grow more efficiently under weaker or artificial light. Genetically modifying plants to optimize photosynthesis could lead to higher yields, especially in regions with inconsistent sunlight, poor soil, or challenging climates. It also raises new possibilities for indoor and vertical farming in urban areas, while reducing the amount of energy required to grow food in controlled environements like greenhouses.

70 weapons depots, 80 missiles, and 3 senior commanders: How a we...	The ongoing aerial assault is being viewed as a regional game changer, proving to Hezbollah that it is not as untouchable as its leaders once believed. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Israel has destroyed scores of Hezbollah missiles, drones, and rocket launchers across Lebanon over the past several days, orchestrating an unprecedented series of pinpoint airstrikes and intelligence-driven operations that have quickly degraded swaths of the terror group's arsenal—and eliminated at least three of the group's senior commanders. Israel's air force is pummeling Hezbollah's arms depots and targeting its senior leadership, marking the 'most extensive' strikes 'ever carried out in its history,' according to the country's military leaders and regional news outlets. Hezbollah, long known as Iran's preeminent regional terror proxy, is being defanged by the Jewish state's armed forces in the process. It has lost almost half of its medium and long-range missiles in a series of Israeli raids designed to annihilate 'surveillance equipment, command rooms, and other infrastructure' used by Hezbollah to rain terror on Israel's northern border. On Wednesday, Israel continued its offensive, showing no signs of backing down from a fight that it largely avoided for months as it turned its attention to Hamas in the wake of the Oct. 7 terror spree. Around 60 key targets belonging to Hezbollah's 'intelligence division' were struck across Lebanon, with Israeli military leaders promising to destroy 'all of their rocket capabilities' and bases. All told, Israel has logged close to 3,000 flight hours, using more than 250 warplanes to drop an estimated 2,000 munitions across 200 separate locations in Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed to the Washington Free Beacon. The strikes have destroyed around 400 medium-range rocket launchers, 70 weapons storage depots, and around 80 drones and cruise missiles. They've also killed at least three senior commanders—rocket and missile division head Ibrahim Qubaisi, military operations head Ibrahim Aqil, and training unit head Ahmed Wahbi—along with other top fighters. The coordinated attacks, Israel says, are 'changing the operational situation in the north, changing the reality,' for Hezbollah as the terror group goes on defense after nearly a year of nonstop terror strikes on Israeli towns throughout the country. The ongoing aerial assault is being viewed as a regional game changer, proving to Hezbollah that it is not as untouchable as its leaders once believed. Still, experts who spoke to the Free Beacon emphasized that Israel has a long way to go in its bid to defeat the terror group. Hezbollah has missiles 'dispersed and buried' across Lebanon, said David Schenker, the State Department's former assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs. 'They still have capabilities, and I think that they always manage to surprise,' he said. 'There's no knockout blow here.' At the same time, there's 'still a long way Israel can go up the escalation ladder,' Richard Goldberg, a former White House National Security Council member, told the Free Beacon. The Jewish state, for example, is reportedly readying a full-blown ground invasion into Lebanon after a Hezbollah missile attack targeted Tel Aviv for the first time in the conflict on Wednesday. Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military's chief of staff, reportedly told forces stationed along the northern border 'to prepare the terrain' for a possible ground incursion. For Goldberg, Israel's actions leading up to the potential invasion have helped provide a strategic advantage. 'Israel is finally committed to climbing the escalation ladder until its primary objective is achieved: the return of 60,000 civilians to their homes,' Goldberg said. 'Israel has disrupted communications, eliminated key leadership assets, degraded command and control, and is now working through every target in the bank to degrade Hezbollah's strategic capabilities.' Israel's airstrikes kicked off last week, shortly after the country launched a devastating surprise attack on Hezbollah's communications infrastructure. Pagers and handheld radios across Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq simultaneously detonated, sidelining an estimated 1,500 Hezbollah fighters, according to Times of Israel military reporter Emanuel Fabian. Israel is particularly interested in Hezbollah's massive cache of sophisticated Iranian missiles and drones, which the terror group has relied on in recent weeks to strike deeper and deeper into the Jewish state's territory. Many of these sites are located in civilian homes and areas, a tactic employed by Hamas and Hezbollah to maximize casualties. Lebanese authorities say that more than 600 have been killed—the highest casualties since Israel's 2006 war on Hezbollah—with Israel assessing that 'many Hezbollah operatives are among the dead.' Over the weekend, as Hezbollah launched hundreds of missiles at Israel, the Jewish state's air force published dramatic footage of planes hitting approximately 180 of the terror group's missile launchers. Hezbollah's command structure has also taken an unprecedented hit, with Israel in recent months assassinating 16 of the group's top leaders, including some who have been eluding authorities for decades due to their role in international terror attacks. Those leaders include Aqil, the head of Hezbollah's operations unit and its elite Radwan Forces. Aqil was killed last week during an airstrike that also eliminated scores of Radwan fighters. Israel also killed Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's highest-ranking military commander, in July. These operations, however, have come with repercussions, as Hezbollah unleashes some of its most advanced missiles to strike as far south as Tel Aviv. The terror group has launched nearly 10,000 attacks on Israel since the war began, using cruise missiles and armed drones to burn almost 200 million square meters of land.

Iranian FM: Tehran to back Lebanon with ‘all means’	Iran’s new president said on Monday that Israel seeks to drag the Middle East into a full-scale war by provoking Tehran to join the conflict in Lebanon. By JNS Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Wednesday evening that Tehran would back Lebanon by 'all means' if the war between Israel and Hezbollah continues to intensify. 'Iran has already shown tremendous patience and restraint for the sake of regional peace and stability,' Araghchi said on the sidelines of the 79th Session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York City. He also told reporters that 'the region is on the brink of a full-scale catastrophe,' adding that Israel had crossed 'all red lines,' according to Reuters. Israel has repeatedly come under fire from the General Assembly podium this week, with condemnations by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Jordanian King Abdullah and others. Iran’s new president said on Monday that Israel seeks to drag the Middle East into a full-scale war by provoking Tehran to join the conflict in Lebanon, Reuters reported on Tuesday. 'We want to live in peace, we don’t want war. It is Israel that seeks to create this all-out conflict,' said Masoud Pezeshkian. Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon told reporters before a Security Council meeting on Wednesday that Israel would welcome a ceasefire and preferred a diplomatic solution, but noted that Iran was the nexus of violence in the region and that peace required dismantling the threat. Hezbollah’s attacks, which have continued nearly daily since Oct. 8, have forced tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes along the border. Israel has in recent days dramatically ramped up its response to Hezbollah’s aggression, after adding the return of its northern residents to their homes to its official war goals.

Word salad sandwich: Harris dodges softballs in friendly chat wit...	Doing what comes naturally, Harris deployed an excessive amount of words to say very little of substance about pressing issues. By Andrew Stiles, The Washington Free Beacon Vice President Kamala Harris recited familiar talking points and dished out indecipherable word salads Wednesday evening during her first solo interview with a national network, MSNBC, and her second interview this month with a media figure who openly supports her campaign, Stephanie Ruhle. (Last week Harris sat down with Oprah Winfrey, the billionaire tycoon.) Most significantly, perhaps, Harris finally weighed in on the Washington Free Beacon's detailed report on the curious nature of her claim to have worked at McDonald's during college. 'I come from the middle class,' Harris said for roughly the thousandth time since accepting the Democratic Party's nomination for president. She also believes in the middle class, as well as 'new industries,' and 'entrepreneurs' and 'bringing down costs.' She is 'serious' about her 'enthusiasm for small businesses' but has also 'spent a lot of time with CEOs' who agree that her policies, such as they are, would revive the economy after four years of failed leadership under President Joe Biden. Ruhle, who just days earlier defended Harris for refusing to give interviews, asked a series of softball questions about the economy, nodding along and helpfully interrupting at times to steer the VP toward a different talking point. Ruhle hardly seemed bothered when Harris made dubious claims a serious journalist could easily fact check in real time, or when Harris didn't even bother to answer her questions. Asked about the American voters 'who don't see themselves' in her economic proposals, Harris concocted one of her signature cocktails of uplifting nonsense. 'Well, if you are hardworking, if you have, uh, the dreams and the ambitions and the aspirations of what I believe you do, um, you're in my plan,' she said. 'You know, I have to tell you, I really love and am so energized by what I know to be the spirit and the character of the American people.' Harris recited familiar Democratic talking points about raising taxes on corporations as well as individuals slightly richer than the college-educated young urban professionals who earn just $395,000 a year and vote for Democrats. Ruhle attempted to press Harris on how she would raise corporate taxes if Republicans won control of the Senate, but Harris declined to give a serious answer. 'We're gonna have to raise corporate taxes,' she said. 'That's just it.' She gave a similar answer when asked about how to solve the immigration crisis. 'It needs to be fixed,' she said. 'We need a comprehensive plan.' Despite falsely claiming that 'top economists in our country,' including the CEO of Goldman Sachs, have endorsed her economic policies, Harris declined to defend the specifics of her plan to combat so-called price gouging that many economists have dismissed as unserious. The VP went on to attack Donald Trump as unserious for failing to think deeply about the issues. 'One must be serious, and have a plan, and a real plan that's not just about some talking point ending in an exclamation at a political rally,' Harris said. Ruhle asked Harris what actions the federal government could take to increase the housing supply in America, and the VP answered in characteristic fashion. First she acknowledged that 'home ownership for too many people in our country now is elusive' under the Biden administration in which she serves. There was 'too much bureaucracy' under Biden, and Harris acknowledged the need to 'reduce the red tape' that her administration has failed to address thus far. Doing what comes naturally, Harris deployed an excessive amount of words to say very little of substance about the issue. She seemed rather proud of herself for remembering to say the word 'holistically' several times. 'Some of the work is gonna be through what we do in terms of giving benefits and assistance to state and local governments around transit dollars, and looking holistically at the connection between that and housing, and looking holistically at the incentives we in the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in [a] holistic manner that includes prioritizing affordable housing,' Harris explained, sort of. Ruhle eventually got around to asking the question on everyone's minds. Did Harris really work at McDonald's, a detail about her life she first shared publicly in 2019 during her disastrous campaign for president in the Democratic primary? As the Free Beacon reported last August, one of the candidate's biographers hadn't even heard about the job at McDonald's, and the campaign has already walked back Harris's initial claim to have worked at the fast food chain to 'pay her way' through college. Harris reiterated her claim but declined to offer definitive evidence. 'I did fries,' she cackled. 'Yes, but I did.' The alleged job gave her 'perspective on the needs of the American people,' which is why she talks about it, Harris said. For whatever reason, though, Harris stopped mentioning the McDonald's job in her stump speeches following the Free Beacon report. 'You have laid out policy in great detail,' Ruhle said with unflappable credulity before concluding the interview with a series of softballs, such as 'When's the last time you had to make a gut decision?' (choosing her running mate, Minnesota governor Tim Walz) and 'Can we trust you?' ('Yes. I'm not perfect but I will tell you I'm always going to put the needs of the American people first.') MSNBC's Chris Hayes hosted the segment. His awkward presence on screen prior to the interview and after the commercial breaks may have alienated some undecided voters. When it was finished, Hayes congratulated Ruhle on 'a great interview' that was 'refreshingly substantive.' He didn't appear to be joking. Minutes before the interview aired, playwright Jeremy O. Harris (MFA, Yale School of Drama) ranted to MSNBC's Ari Melber about how Democrats should respect young voters who sympathize with terrorists and want the United States to place an 'arms embargo' on Israel 'at the very least.' Minutes after it aired, Ruhle said it was all good that Harris didn't give substantive answers. 'One could watch that and say, 'Well, she didn't give a clear, direct answer,'' Ruhle said. 'That's okay, because we are not talking about clear or direct issues.'

‘Dangerous error’ – Israeli officials slam potential Hezbollah ce...	Coalition ministers and local leaders vocally oppose pause in fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Reports claiming that a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah is imminent have sparked serious backlash in Israel, as officials voice their opposition to the potential pause in the fighting. Senior Biden administration officials told Sky News that they expected an official acceptance of the proposal, which would see both parties lay down their arms for at least 21 days, 'within hours.' Several members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition responded with outrage to the proposed deal, which American officials hinted had been green-lighted by the prime minister. 'The campaign in the north should end in one scenario — crushing Hezbollah, denying its ability to harm the residents of the north,' wrote Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on social media platform X. 'The enemy must not be given time to recover from the heavy blows it received and to reorganize for the continuation of the war after 21 days,' he added. Culture Minister Miki Zohar, who is a close ally of Netanyahu, told Hebrew-language media that he hoped reports about a ceasefire were 'not true.' A pause in the military campaign against Hezbollah, Zohar said, would be 'a serious error that endangers Israel’s major security achievements in recent days.' David Azoulay, the mayor of Metula, a town adjacent to the Lebanese border where some 50 percent of the houses have been damaged by Hezbollah's near-daily rockets, missiles, and explosive drones, warned that a ceasefire would pave the way 'for the next October 7th.' Azoulay stressed that 'without decisively defeating' Hezbollah, the terror group still poses a tremendous risk to residents of the community. 'There is a time for negotiations, but this is not the time,' said Upper Galilee Regional Council’s chairman Amir Sofer. 'We must not be misled by international pressure,' he added. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he was convening an 'urgent meeting' of his Religious Zionism party members to discuss next steps, should the reports of the ceasefire be true. Netanyahu is currently en route to New York to speak at the UN General Assembly. His office refused to comment on the reports of an emerging ceasefire.

Israel, Hezbollah on verge of truce, say US officials	Senior US officials say fighting on the Israel - Lebanon border to be halted for three weeks, with truce expected to be announced 'in coming hours,' with hopes for more expansive ceasefire. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel and the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah are poised to halt hostilities during a three-week truce, senior American officials claimed early Thursday morning. Speaking with Sky News, senior U.S. officials said they expect a 21-day truce to be initiated between the two sides 'in the coming hours.' 'The ceasefire will be for 21 days along the blue line,' a Biden administration official said, referring to the boundary between Israel and Lebanon. 'During those 21 days, the parties will negotiate towards a potential resolution of the conflict that has been ongoing since Hezbollah launched the attack on October 8, and to reach a comprehensive agreement along the blue line that allows for residents to return to their home in both Lebanon and Israel.' Israeli Opposition Leader Yair Lapid, head of the center-left Yesh Atid faction, said he supported a temporary truce, but did not endorse the proposed three-week cessation of fighting, saying it could enable Hezbollah to regroup, after the pro-Iranian organization suffered heavy losses in Israeli attacks over the past week and a half. 'The State of Israel needs to announce this morning that it accepts the Biden-Macron proposal for a ceasefire, but only for seven days, so that it does not enable Hezbollah to rebuild its command structure and reestablish its control,' Lapid tweeted. 'We will not accept any proposal that does not include distancing Hezbollah from our northern border.' The United States, Britain, and France earlier this week called on Israel and Hezbollah to accept a three-week ceasefire. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the United Nations Security Council that 'a diplomatic solution is indeed possible,' expressing optimism a three-week truce could be achieved. 'In recent days, we've worked with our American partners on a temporary ceasefire platform of 21 days to allow for negotiations.' Late Wednesday night Barrot claimed that significant progress had been made towards achieving the proposed truce.

Hinting Iran was behind assassination attempts, Trump threatens t...	Former President Trump suggests Iran may have been behind two attempts on his life, repeatedly threatens to blow Iran 'to smithereens.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President Donald Trump intimated Wednesday that the two attempts made on his life this year may have been orchestrated by the Iranian government, after the Republican 2024 presidential nominee was informed by the Biden administration of 'real and specific threats' by the Tehran regime to assassinate him. During a campaign rally in North Carolina Wednesday evening, Trump hinted that Iran may have been involved in the July 13th shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania that left him wounded in the ear, and in the September 15th, shooting at Trump's golf club in Florida. 'As you know, there have been two assassination attempts on my life that we know of, and they may or may not involve - but possibly do - Iran,' Trump said. The former president then threatened repeatedly to retaliate against Iran for any possible future assassination attempts by bombing the country 'to smithereens.' 'If I were the president, I would inform the threatening country, in this case Iran, that if you do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens.' The United States, Trump continued, has been 'threatened very directly by Iran,' emphasizing the need to provide a credible threat of retaliation for any potential future attacks. 'The best way to do it is through the office of the president, that if you do any attacks on former presidents or candidates for president, your country gets blown to smithereens, as we say.' Trump made the comments a day after the Biden administration is said to have informed the former president of 'threats' by Iran to assassinate him. 'President Trump was briefed earlier today by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence regarding real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States,' Cheung said late Tuesday night. This is not the first time Trump has hinted at a possible link between the attempts on his life and the Iranian government. In July, following the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that were he to be assassinated, the U.S. should wipe Iran 'off the face of the Earth.' 'If they do 'assassinate President Trump,' which is always a possibility, I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth - If that does not happen, American Leaders will be considered 'gutless' cowards!' On Thursday, Trump announced plans to return to Butler, Pennsylvania, the scene of the first assassination attempt, for a campaign rally, slated for October 5th.

Two civilian employees at the port, a 68-year-old man and a 28-year-old man, were lightly wounded by shrapnel and treated at the scene by Magen David Adom paramedics. Both men did not require hospitalization, the ambulance and first-responder medical service added. Footage circulating on social media showed a large plume of smoke rising over the impact site. Hebrew-language media reported that the blast had sparked fires in the port area and near the nearby Herod's Palace hotel. Since October 2023, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has launched numerous explosive drones at the Jewish State. Early Wednesday morning, the terror group's drone impacted an army base near the small Negev desert community of Sapir. The IDF said that the drone had caused damage to the base, but that no troops were injured. Also on Wednesday, the group attempted to attack numerous sites in the southern Golan Heights, triggering sirens in Ramat Magshimim, Avnei Eitan, and other communities. In June, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq launched a drone that exploded near Eilat, though it failed to reach its likely target of the port. The group has also claimed to have launched crise missiles at Israel, all of which have been intercepted.

US, France demand immediate Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire	Backed by European Union and Arab countries, U.S. and France demand 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macros released a joint statement on Wednesday evening calling for an immediate 21-day ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah terror group. 'We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately… and to give a real chance to a diplomatic settlement,' read the statement, which was released after an emergency UN Security Council meeting on the ongoing fighting in Lebanon. Biden and Macron claimed that negotiations for an agreement 'cannot succeed amid an escalation of this conflict,' before calling for 'an immediate 21 day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement.' The statement did not acknowledge that the U.S. has been attempting to broker a ceasefire for nearly a year, and has repeatedly failed in its efforts. 'The situation between Lebanon and Israel since October 8th, 2023, is intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation,' the text read. Notably, the statement refrained from providing important context regarding that date, including Hezbollah had launched an unprovoked attack on Israel just one day after the Hamas massacres. 'This is in nobody’s interest, neither of the people of Israel nor of the people of Lebanon,' the statement continued. 'It is time to conclude a diplomatic settlement that enables civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes in safety.' That statement was endorsed by the European Union and several Arab countries. Israel and Lebanon are expected to announce 'within hours' if they accept the proposal, claimed a Biden administration official speaking anonymously to media. 'We have had this conversation with the parties and felt this was the right moment,' the official added. The official did not elaborate regarding which parties within Lebanon had been privy to the potential agreement. The government of Lebanon has said on numerous occasions that it cannot enforce policies on the Hezbollah terror group or influence its actions.

Democratic senators pushing bill imposing arms embargo on Israel	Bernie Sanders joined by other progressive Democrats in introducing bill which would block the sale of over $20 billion in arms to Israel. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A group of progressive Senate Democrats are pushing legislation which would impose a sweeping arms embargo on Israel, blocking tens of billions of dollars-worth of planned weapons sales to the Jewish state amid its ongoing war against the Hamas terror organization and escalating conflict with the Lebanon-based Hezbollah terrorist group. On Wednesday, Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders formally introduced a bill to the U.S. Senate aimed at blocking weapons sales to Israel, accusing the Jewish state of waging an 'immoral' and 'illegal' war against Gaza following the invasion of October 7th. 'Israel has egregiously violated' rules laid out by the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act, Sanders claimed in a statement to the press Wednesday. The senior Vermont senator and former presidential hopeful also cited the Biden administration's efforts to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 'extremist' government of intentionally preventing an agreement from being reached. 'Every time an agreement appears close, Netanyahu introduces new demands and sinks the deal,' Sanders continued. 'It is clear that Netanyahu is prolonging the war to cling to power and avoid prosecution for corruption. Meanwhile, his government has also overseen record illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank and unleashed a wave of violence there that has killed nearly 700 Palestinians, including 150 children, and several Americans over the last 11 months.' 'Sending more weapons to Netanyahu’s extremist government is unacceptable.' The Senate bill would bar the U.S. from selling a number of weapons systems to the Israeli military, blocking existing procurement orders valued at roughly $20 billion. The embargo would, if passed, bar the U.S. from selling Joint Direct Attack Munitions - a smart-bomb apparatus used to convert simple aerial munitions into guided bombs - along with tank and artillery shells, tactical ground vehicles, and F-15 fighter jets and associated parts and weapons. Two progressive Senate Democrats, including Oregon's Jeff Merkley and the junior Senator for Vermont, Peter Welch, signed on to most of the bans proposed in Sanders' Joint Resolutions of Disapproval, while declining to join his call to ban the sale of F-15s.

Pentagon says it’s not sharing intelligence or providing support ...	Pentagon: 'When it comes to Lebanon, the U.S. military has no involvement in Israel's operations.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Pentagon said it's not proving intelligence support to Israel in its operations against Hezbollah, Reuters reports. When Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh was asked if the US was providing support, including sharing intelligence, with Israel during its operations against Hezbollah, she replied, 'No, no support.' She also said it didn't appear that an Israeli ground invasion of Hezbollah was imminent. 'When it comes to Lebanon, the U.S. military has no involvement in Israel's operations,' Singh said. Nonetheless, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Monday, 'In light of increased tensions in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel' to augment those already in place.' The U.S. already has considerable forces in the region, including an aircraft carrier strike group. Although not publicly criticizing the operations, US President Joe Biden is reportedly opposed to Israel's defense against Hezbollah, according to Politico. The US officials warned their Israeli counterparts on Monday that operations against Hezbollah would put a halt to a diplomatic solution, one they preferred to military strikes. On Monday, Hezbollah launched a barrage of missiles, many of which targeted cities around Haifa, Tiberias and the Galilee region. In response, Israel launched extensive strikes in Lebanon, killing dozens of Hezbollah terrorists. In a speech on Tuesday to the UN General Assembly, Joe Biden said, ''Full-scale war is not in anyone’s interest,' 'The situation has escalated…. A solution is still possible. In fact, it remains the only path to lasting security and to allow the residents of both countries to return to their homes.' In July, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US would support Israel if a war broke out with Lebanon. 'If Israel is attacked.. we will help to help Israel defend itself. We’ve been clear about that from the very beginning, but again, we don’t want to see that happen,' Austin said. 'Israel will do what it needs to defend itself. And it’s demonstrated that you know, time and again,' Austin explained. 'Certainly that’s not a scenario that we’d like to see occur,' Austin said. Austin said, 'We remain concerned about the potential of this escalating into a full fight. And I don’t believe that a fight is inevitable.' 'I think that you know, we’d like to see things resolved in a diplomatic fashion,' he added.

During the Syrian civil war, Hezbollah perpetrated numerous atrocities as they were deployed in various areas in the country to crush Sunni resistance. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Many Syrians are celebrating Israel's operations against Hezbollah because of the terror group's role in atrocities during its civil war. During the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, Hezbollah assisted the government of Syria's Alawite president, Bashar al-Assad, as part of the Iranian-Shia so-called 'axis of resistance.' Hezbollah perpetrated numerous atrocities as they were deployed in various areas in Syria to crush Sunni resistance. Syrians have taken to social media amid Israel's operations and are rejoicing over the Jewish State's targeted strikes in Lebanon. Syrian journalist Hadi al-Abdallah wrote, 'Even if the devil himself came and killed Hezbollah's thugs, we'd be just as happy.' He added footage of Hezbollah's attacks against Syrian civilians and wrote, 'This footage shows Hezbollah fighters attacking the city of Zabadani in Syria's Qalamoun region. Blind hatred. They attacked civilian homes and everyone in them—women, children, the elderly. All that mattered to them was that they were killing.' Al Arabiya said the strikes were a just punishment against the terror group for its 'raping women and killing children.' Another Syrian posted on social media, 'My problem with Hezbollah is that they killed my brother and my cousins. They killed our neighbor's daughter, a baby less than a year old, while she was in her mother's arms. They killed my people in Madaya. My problem with Hezbollah is that they destroyed my country.' Many social media users in Syria commented on the assassination of individual terrorists and including the death of Radwan commander Hussein Ali Ghandour. Hussein Ali Ghandour was known as the 'Butcher of Madaya' who trapped and starved Syrians and buried them alive. 'Hezbollah participated in the killing of the Syrian people in the worst ways, including sieges and starvation. All the free people and those oppressed by Iran and its militias have the right to rejoice today,' one wrote. Syrians also welcomed the news that explosion-laden beepers killed dozens and injured thousands of Hezbollah terrorists. 'The pagers exploded. What great news. We Syrians aren't used to hearing such good news,' one person wrote.

The BBC has regularly received criticism for its policy of not referring to members of organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorists. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Yariv Mozer, director of the 'We Will Dance Again' Nova music festival documentary, recounted how the BBC wouldn't allow the film to be aired unless any reference to Hamas as terrorists was edited out. The documentary, which combines interviews with survivors and actual footage, began as a project on Israeli documentary channel Hot8 in collaboration with MGM and eventually Paramount. It is being shown in the United States as a Paramount + documentary. Mozer told the Hollywood Reporter, 'Then, the BBC, the version they’ll air won’t describe Hamas as terrorists. It was a price I was willing to pay so that the British public will be able to see these atrocities and decide if this is a terrorist organization or not.' He also discussed how often broadcasters hesitated about showing the Nova festival massacre because they considered the film political. 'I was pitching this to several U.S. streaming platforms and what I was told is that they’re afraid of touching this subject matter, the 7th of October, because of concerns about the political situation,' he said. However, he insisted the film is not political but rather a testament to the victims of terrorism and a means of telling their stories. 'The film isn’t political. It’s told from the eyes of the survivors and from the eyes of Hamas. There is one truth about what happened,' he added. The BBC has regularly received criticism for its policy of not referring to members of organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorists. Not only did the BBC decline to call assassinated Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, one of the masterminds of the October 7th massacre, a terrorist, but a story on the terror leader after his death described him as 'moderate and pragmatic.' 'Despite his tough rhetoric, analysts generally saw him as moderate and pragmatic, compared to the more hardline Gaza-based leaders,' the BBC report said. In May, the then Foreign Secretary of the UK, David Cameron, was staunchly critical of the broadcasting company for declining to use the word 'terrorist' in connection with Hamas. 'If you kidnap grandmothers, kidnap babies, you rape people, you shoot children in front of their parents, what more do they need to do for the BBC to say, ‘Look, these are terrorists?’' The post BBC agreed to air Nova festival massacre documentary only if Hamas not described as 'terrorists' appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/bbc-agreed-to-air-nova-festival-massacre-documentary-only-if-hamas-not-described-as-terrorists/	2024-09-25T13:00:07-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_1162642912.png
Argentina’s Milei scorches UN for anti-Israel bias	Following the speech, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon thanked him for supporting the Jewish state. By JNS Argentine President Javier Milei criticized the United Nations for what he said was its anti-Israeli bias during a fiery address at the General Debate of the General Assembly’s 79th session in New York on Tuesday. He called out the world body for systematically voting against the Jewish state, 'the only democracy in the Middle East, which protects liberal democracy,' adding that the United Nations has 'simultaneously shown a total inability to respond to the scourge of terrorism.' The libertarian leader also observed that 'in this same house, that purports to defend human rights, we have also included bloody dictatorships in the Human Rights Council, including Cuba and Venezuela, without reproach.' Following the speech, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon thanked him for supporting the Jewish state. 'I was moved to hear the speech of the President of Argentina at the General Assembly. President Milei, you are a true friend of the State of Israel. In this hall, where we were slandered all day, you showed courage and supported Israel! Thank you!'

Rare document that shows contributions of Jewish financier to Ame...	Salomon was also one of the founders and main donors to Mikveh Israel, a Philadelphia synagogue, still active today, nicknamed the 'Synagogue of the American Revolution.' By Jackie Hajdenberg, JTA After 10 years on display at Philadelphia’s Weitzman National Museum of American Jewish History, a document penned by James Madison linking Jewish financier Haym Salomon to the American Revolution is now for sale. The document, a sheet from the ledger of Madison, who later became the fourth U.S. president, showed the Virginia delegation’s expenses and receipts during the 1780 Continental Congress. It lists contributions from Salomon, a Sephardic Jewish immigrant from Poland who came to America in 1775 and is considered one of the leadingJames Madison funders of the Revolutionary War effort. The sheet containing Salomon’s name is the only known surviving page from Madison’s ledger. The page is currently owned by the Raab Collection, an international firm that specializes in the buying and selling of important historical documents. The Raab Collection has previously sold a letter from Theodore Roosevelt stating that he wanted a Jewish person at his side during his nomination for the Republican presidential ticket in 1904 and an original copy of the United States’ official recognition of the State of Israel, signed by President Harry Truman. 'Jews in early America were strong patriots and fought for freedom alongside their Christian friends and neighbors,' Nathan Raab, the collection’s president, said in a statement. 'This meant that our Founding Fathers had Jewish friends, supporters, and allies at the dawn of our nation. This document shows that vividly.' Salomon was a financial broker for merchants. A backer of the American Revolution, Salomon joined the Sons of Liberty in 1775 and was arrested the following year by the British and accused of being a spy for Gen. George Washington. He was arrested again in 1778 and sentenced to death, but reportedly bribed his jailer and escaped to Philadelphia, where he continued his work as a broker, providing loans to prominent American figures including Madison. Salomon is estimated to have given about $600,000 of his personal fortune toward the American Revolution — about $23 million in today’s dollars. He died at 44 in 1785, less than two years after the treaty ending the war was signed, and was destitute because his loans had not been repaid. Salomon’s significance went unrecognized for nearly a century and was then disputed for some time. In 1927, after the United States had celebrated its 150th birthday, New York City rejected an offer by a Jewish immigrants’ group to build a statue of Salomon in Madison Square Park, citing an assessment that he was merely a mercenary and not a true believer in the American cause. Later, infighting between Polish and German Jews in the city caused a second memorial plan to be scuttled. A memorial was finally erected in Chicago, where it had the support of a large Polish population, in the 1930s.

(Shutterstock) By the following decade, a positive narrative had solidified around Salomon. Salomon was also one of the founders and main donors to Mikveh Israel, a Philadelphia synagogue, still active today, nicknamed the 'Synagogue of the American Revolution.' There is contemporaneous evidence of Madison’s relationship with Salomon but the ledger page, which the Raab Collection has priced at $50,000, is the only document from the era showing the amount of money he loaned the nascent United States. 'I have for some time been a pensioner on the favor of Haym Salomon,' Madison wrote in a 1782 or 1783 letter to Edmund Randolph, who later became secretary of state. 'The kindness of our friend near the coffeehouse is a fund that will preserve me from extremities, but I never resort to it without great mortification, as he obstinately rejects all recompense.' Whether the document remains on public view will be the decision of the buyer, if there is one. A spokesperson for the Weitzman Museum, which is seeking to become part of the public Smithsonian network of museums, said on Friday that she was unaware of the potential sale.

Only 1% of young US voters ‘most concerned’ about Israeli-Palesti...	The data calls into question whether Democrats actually benefit from seeking to placate the anti-Israel forces within their own ranks. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner Americans aged 18-29 are overwhelmingly indifferent to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a new poll has found, casting doubt on conventional wisdom that the country’s youth are enraged over the Jewish state’s defensive military operations in Gaza. When asked which issue concerned them most, a meager 1 percent of respondents within the youngest age bracket of eligible US voters answered the 'Israel/Palestine conflict,' according to the poll by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics. In contrast, young voters expressed far more interest in domestic issues such as the economy, inflation, and abortion. The Democratic Party’s recent overtures to anti-Israel activists could potentially be wrongheaded, according to the polling data, which found that young voters are not likely to trust Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris more than Republican nominee Donald Trump to resolve the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Among voters aged 18-29, 28 percent said they 'trust' Trump on the war in Gaza and 26 percent 'trust' Harris. Harris performed far better against Trump among young voters on an array of domestic issues such as gun control, abortion, health care, and education. Though activists have insisted that embracing an arms embargo on the Jewish state will help Harris consolidate youth support ahead of Election Day in November, Harvard’s polling data paints a more complicated picture. Among young voters, 32 percent indicated they support implementing an 'arms embargo with Israel,' and 20 percent said they were opposed. A plurality, 44 percent, responded they 'don’t know' if they support blocking weapons transfers to Israel. The data calls into question whether Democrats actually benefit from seeking to placate the anti-Israel forces within their own ranks. In recent months, Harris has attempted to win over pro-Palestinian voters by adopting a more adversarial posture toward the Jewish state. The Democratic National Convention (DNC), where Harris officially became the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, hosted a panel on 'Palestinian Human Rights' for the first time in history, in which activists accused Israel of committing a 'genocide' in Hamas-ruled Gaza. While accepting the presidential nomination, Harris vowed to end the Israel-Hamas war and secure an elusive ceasefire deal, along with a new era of 'dignity, security, freedom, and self determination' for Palestinians. Despite the extensive focus of media outlets, lawmakers, and commentators on the anti-Israel campus protests at elite universities such as Harvard, the latest polling data suggests that the typical young voter in the US shows minimal engagement with foreign affairs.

What would a ground war in Lebanon look like?	If Israel does launch a ground war, how deep into the Lebanese territory would it reach? By Anna Epshtein, TPS Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly vowed to prevent 60,000 evacuated residents of northern Israel to return to their homes, prompting escalating rocket attacks and Israeli airstrikes — all raising the likelihood of a ground invasion of Lebanon. Experts described to The Press Service of Israel different war scenarios but stressed that a ground operation could be avoided. Israel’s escalating airstrikes 'Are not preparation for a ground op, it’s a way to escape it,' Professor Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies, told TPS-IL. Israel is demonstrating its capabilities, showing it is not afraid of war in order to make Hezbollah agree to a diplomatic solution,' he said. Echoing that point, Yaakov Lappin, a research fellow at the Alma Research Institute and a military analyst for the Jewish News Syndicate told TPS-IL, ‘What is happening now is an Israeli ultimatum to Hezbollah, and also to Iran. The ultimatum says that the phase of the war of attrition is over, and now Nasrallah and Khamenei must decide – a ceasefire in the north or a full-scale war.' The Litani River If Israel does launch a ground war, how deep into the Lebanese territory would it reach? 'The Litani River is a natural border,’ said Prof. Eyal Zisser, a vice-rector of Tel Aviv university and a senior research fellow at Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern Studies. The Litani is Lebanon’s longest river, originating near the city of Baalbek, following the Beqaa Valley south before turning west and reaching the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating south of the Litani. However, Israel may decide to go deeper into Lebanese territory. There are two possible scenarios, said Prof. Eitan Shamir, managing director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, who lectures on political science at Bar-Ilan University. He is also a former head of the national security doctrine department in the Israel Ministry of Strategic Affairs. 'In scenario A, the ground op will be a very limited one, where Israel does not cross the Litani river. The goal is to move Hezbollah from the border and to let the residents of the Israeli north to get back home,' Shamir said. 'This will not help against the rockets, because the rockets are launched from deeper inside Lebanon. But first, there will be no anti-tank missiles,' he added. 'And secondly, Hezbollah won’t sit on the fence, threatening the Israeli residents with an October 7-like invasion.' Scenario B, Shamir explained, would be a riskier, larger scale invasion reaching Beirut to destroy Hezbollah’s military capabilities as much as possible. 'Like we did to Hamas in Gaza,' he said. But according to Michael, once Israeli soldiers cross the Lebanese border, a 'limited operation' will not be an option. 'If a ground operation starts, it means an all-out war, and the goal of it will be to critically hurt Hezbollah, as well as to destroy the terrorist infrastructure in Lebanon,' Michael insisted. ‘It Needs to Be Done Quicker’ Most of the analysts agreed that it would take anywhere from three weeks to three months for Israel to create a security zone in Lebanon to enable norther residents to return home. 'We can’t allow another 11 months to deal with Hezbollah in the north,' Michael stressed. 'It needs to be done quicker.' Lappin said an invasion’s first phase would be 'an intensive attack on Hezbollah’s capabilities, military forces, launchers, operatives, tunnels, bunkers, command and control centers, while dealing with Hezbollah’s defense lines and territorial unit.' The second phase, said Lappin would deal with eliminating Hezbollah’s attempts to rebuild, which could take at least six months. Asked about exit strategies, the analysts agreed that Israel would need to ensure that Hezbollah is not able to cross the Litani again. 'The question is not when we leave Lebanon, but what the day after will look like,' said Zisser. According to Lappin, leaving Lebanon will depend on resolving who enforces Security Council Resolution 1701. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, he added, 'has utterly failed in enforcing this.' Said Michael, 'You don’t need to stay in the security zone forever to ensure it’s quiet there. The army can enter it whenever necessary, based on intelligence – as it does in Jenin or in Tulkarem.' But Shamir noted that Israel would have to stay in the security 'at least for a while,' adding, 'And every temporary thing tends to become permanent, so maybe Israel will stay de-facto.' Said Zisser, 'Everybody was afraid of entering Gaza, and the army fought there excellently. We know how to win. This is what the army can take with it from Gaza to Lebanon.'

‘World’s oldest Hebrew book’ unveiled at DC exhibit	According to the museum, the book includes oldest extant version of the Haggadah, the Jewish book read during the Passover Seder. By JNS The Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday unveiled what it says is the oldest Hebrew book ever discovered, dating to the 8th century and originating with Jews living in a Buddhist civilization in modern-day Afghanistan. Located just two blocks south of the National Mall, the institution titled the exhibit 'Sacred Words: Revealing the Earliest Hebrew Book.' It runs through Jan. 12, 2025. It will also make a stop in New York at the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary, according to the Jewish Telegraph Agency. The 'world's earliest Jewish book' isn't quite what it sounds like, but it's an 8th-century Afghan manuscript with a fascinating story, now on display at @museumofBible Report from @Jerusalem_Post pic.twitter.com/oH6l77Zvta &mdash; Mosaic (@mosaicmag) September 19, 2024 The ancient manuscript in book form, known as a codex, is 1,300 years old based on carbon dating, a relic of the Silk Road—an ancient trade route linking China with the West. According to the museum, the book was created by Jews living as a minority among Buddhists who ruled the Bamiyan Valley in the central highlands of what is today Afghanistan. The book measures five inches by five inches and includes Hebrew texts written by different sources—prayers, poems and, according to the museum, the oldest extant version of the Haggadah, the Jewish book read during the Passover Seder. The museum’s claims are based on the work of a team of researchers, whose findings will be published by Dutch publisher Brill in April.

Israel beginning ‘new stage’ of battle against Hezbollah, says ge...	The commander of the IDF's forces on the northern front says Israel is beginning a 'new stage' in its battle against the Hezbollah terrorist organization. By World Israel News Staff Israel's military is entering a 'new stage' in its military campaign against the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon, a senior IDF officer said yesterday. On Tuesday, Major General Ori Gordin, chief of the IDF's Northern Command, visited the field office of the army's 7th Brigade and met with the brigade's soldiers and officers during a readiness exercise near the Lebanese frontier. During his visit, Gordin held an operational assessment with brigade officers, discussing the force's preparedness for a new major operation on the northern front aimed at restoring security to the Galilee and enabling the roughly 70,000 evacuees to return home, an IDF spokesperson said. Gordin said the IDF was at the cusp of a 'new stage' in the conflict with Hezbollah, following major escalations between Israel and Hezbollah. 'We are beginning a new stage in the battle, and we are in the midst of Operation Northern Arrows,' Gordin said. 'We have entered a new phase of the campaign and we are now in the midst of Operation Northern Arrows.' 'The operation began with a significant blow to Hezbollah's capabilities, focusing on their firepower capabilities, and a very significant hit on the organization's commanders and operatives.' 'In light of this, we need to change the security situation, and we must be fully prepared for maneuvers and action.' On Monday and Tuesday, Israeli warplanes pounded hundreds of Hezbollah positions across southern and eastern Lebanon, targeting buildings - including private homes - used to store missiles and rockets. According to the Lebanese health ministry, more than 570 people were killed in the airstrikes, with over 1,600 others injured. On Friday, the IDF bombed a Beirut gathering of members of the Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, killing sixteen terrorists, including two senior Radwan officers. Last Tuesday and Wednesday, thousands of Hezbollah operatives were injured and dozens killed after pagers and radios issued by the terrorist group simultaneously exploded in three apparent Israeli attacks.

Kibbutz hit in rocket attack, leaving man seriously injured	Two men injured, one of them seriously, after rocket directly hits kibbutz in northwestern Israel near the Lebanese border. By World Israel News Staff Two men were injured in a Hezbollah rocket attack on northern Israel Wednesday afternoon. The strike occurred in Kibbutz Sa'ar in the northwestern Galilee outside of the city of Nahariya, near the Lebanese frontier at just after 1:30 p.m. A rocket fired by Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon scored a direct hit on the kibbutz, spreading shrapnel which injured two men, both of whom have been identified as construction workers. One of the victims, a 35-year-old man, was seriously injured in the attack, while the second, a 52-year-old man, is listed in moderate condition. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the two victims before evacuating them to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya for further treatment. United Hatzalah volunteer EMTs Dror Nir, Doron Almog, and Radi Hadad, who responded to the attack, relayed from the scene: 'There was a direct hit to a building undergoing renovations.' 'We provided initial treatment at the scene to two construction workers - a 35-year-old man in serious condition and a 52-year-old man in moderate condition. Both suffered shrapnel injuries. Members of United Hatzalah's Psychotrauma and Crisis Response Unit provided assistance to several people who suffered from emotional shock.' According to a statement by Magen David Adom, the seriously injured victim suffered shrapnel wounds to his upper torso, while the second victim was wounded by shrapnel in his lower body. The rocket attack comes just hours after Hezbollah terrorists launched a ballistic missile towards the Tel Aviv metropolitan area Wednesday morning, the first attempt by Hezbollah to hit the center of the country since fighting broke out last October. The missile, which was shot down by Israel's defense network, was intended to hit Mossad headquarters, Hezbollah claimed.

Israel’s population tops 10 million	Ahead of Jewish new year's, Israel's population estimated at just over 10 million, rising 118,000 over in 2023, with 183,000 new babies born. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The population of Israel is estimated to have topped 10 million people this year, based on data released by the government bureau of statistics. On Wednesday, the Central Bureau of Statistics published data on the population of Israel, ahead of the upcoming Rosh Hashanah holiday, marking the Jewish new year's. According to the report, at the end of 2023, Israel's total population numbered 9,915,000, with an annual growth rate of 1.6%, down from 2.2% the year before. Israel's growth rate was fueled primarily by natural growth, with some 183,000 babies born in Israel during 2023, compared to approximately 46,000 total immigrants to Israel, and a net negative migration balance. Some 55,300 people emigrated from Israel in 2023, while 27,800 Israelis moved back. A total of roughly 55,000 people died during 2023. Based on Israel's growth rate in 2023, the country is estimated to have topped 10 million earlier this year. Broken down by demographic groups, 77.0% of Israel's population was in the 'Jewish and others' category at the end of 2023 with 7,632,000 people, compared to 20.8% in the Arab sector, with 2,067,000 people. In addition, Israel at the end of 2023 was home to 216,000 foreign nationals who do not carry Israeli citizenship. By September 2024, the number of citizens had risen from less than 9.7 million to nearly 9.8 million, with the figure for the total number of residents rising to just over 10 million once foreign nationals are included. Nearly half (43.5%) of Israeli Jews identified themselves religiously as 'not-religious, secular,' compared to 11.3% who said they are ultra-Orthodox, 12.5% who categorized themselves as 'religious,' 13.0% who defined themselves as 'religious-traditional,' and 18.9% who described themselves as 'traditional, not-so-religious.' During 2023, 51,643 couples were married, while 15,196 couples got divorced. There were a total of 2,920,300 households across Israel at the end of 2023, with an average of 3.19 people per household. Of those, 2,297,400 were defined as nuclear family households.

Israel pushing Middle East towards ‘all-out war’ – Arab countries	Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq blame Israel for current tensions, do not condemn Hamas or Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Three Arab countries released a statement blaming Israel for rising tensions in the region, ignoring the previous eleven months of Hezbollah's near-daily attacks on the Jewish State. The statement, from the foreign ministries of Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq, also refrained from mentioning the October 7th Hamas massacres, which triggered the current conflict. The officials, who released the statement from the UN General Assembly in New York, said that restoring stability to the Middle East begins with stopping 'the Israeli aggression on Gaza.' Reining in Israel is the only way to halt the 'dangerous escalation underway,' they charged, while failing to denounce the Hamas and Hezbollah terror groups. The Jewish State is entirely to blame for the current tensions in the Middle East, which 'will have serious consequences on the entire region,' they said. 'Israel is pushing the entire region into an all-out war,' the foreign ministers stressed. The statement also demanded that the UN security council and international actors to 'to bear their responsibilities to stop the war.' Jordan and Egypt have peace treaties with Israel, but their political leaders often make public statements that are extremely hostile towards Israel. Earlier in September, three Israelis were murdered by a Jordanian terrorist at the Allenby Border Crossing, which connects the Hashemite Kingdom with Palestinian Authority-administered territory in Judea and Samaria. The terrorist was hailed as a national hero in Jordan. 'Lebanon is at the brink. The people of Lebanon, the people of Israel, and the people of the world, cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza,' UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. Guterres ignored the fact that Hezbollah has been bombarding northern Israeli communities with missiles, rockets, and explosive drones for nearly a year, and did not provide any context for the current fighting in Lebanon.

US grants Qatar visa-free travel despite terror ties	This decision raises some eyebrows, as Qatar has also hosted leaders from Hamas and the Taliban, yet now enjoys privileges typically reserved for longstanding U.S. allies. By The Associated Press The Gulf nation of Qatar on Tuesday became just the second Muslim-majority country to be admitted into a program that allows its citizens to travel to the United States without first obtaining a U.S. visa. The departments of State and Homeland Security jointly announced that Qatar had met stringent eligibility requirements to join the visa waiver program. Those requirements include a low visa refusal rate, a low rate of visa overstays and a demand of reciprocal treatment of American travelers, who are already allowed to visit Qatar without a visa for up to 30 days. 'Qatar has been an exceptional partner for the United States, and our strategic relationship has only grown stronger over the past few years,' the departments said in a statement. 'This is further evidence of our strategic partnership and our shared commitment to security and stability.' Qatar, which has played a key role in trying to negotiate a cease-fire deal in Gaza and was an instrumental U.S. partner before and during the American withdrawal from Afghanistan, is the 42nd country to be admitted to the program. This decision raises some eyebrows, as Qatar has also hosted leaders from Hamas and the Taliban, yet now enjoys privileges typically reserved for longstanding U.S. allies. Most countries whose citizens can visit the U.S. without a visa are longstanding allies in Europe and Asia. The only other Muslim-majority country in the program is the tiny Southeast Asian nation of Brunei. Although Qatar’s population is just over 3 million people, only a small percentage of those — about 320,000 — are actually Qataris who would be eligible for the program if they hold valid passports. The vast majority of people who live in Qatar are foreign workers and other expatriates who do not hold Qatari passports. The program allows citizens of qualifying nations to enter the U.S. for business or tourism without a visa for up to 90 days, although they must still obtain approval through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, which is done online and doesn’t require an in-person interview as visa applications do. After Oct. 1, U.S. citizens will be allowed to stay in Qatar without a visa for 90 days.

US asks Israel to protect its citizens in Lebanon during evacuati...	The American embassy in Beirut has urged U.S. citizens to 'depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration has asked Israel to protect American citizens in Lebanon during a possible evacuation process, Axios reported Monday. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin raised the issue of installing a 'deconfliction' mechanism with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, on Saturday, so that the IDF doesn’t accidentally hit Americans who are trying to leave the country. Axios reported that 'while there has been no decision to move forward with an evacuation, the Israelis are receptive to the U.S. concerns.' In commenting on the phone call, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement that 'Secretary Austin emphasized his concern for the safety and security of U.S. citizens in the region.' The call came after the IDF began massive airstrikes on Hezbollah targets, which have yet to stop, and the terrorists have responded with hundreds of rocket and missile attacks on Israel that have reached deeper into the country than ever before. The exchange of aerial assaults is the worst since the 2006 Second Lebanon War, when the U.S. did evacuate its citizens due to Israel’s ground invasion, which was limited to the southern part of the country. Currently, Israel’s air force is going much further, pummeling Hezbollah forces in its neighborhoods in Beirut and strongholds in the Bekaa Valley, some 60 miles into Lebanon. The IDF has also successfully eliminated many of the Iranian terror proxy’s most senior commanders in the last week, including assassinating the head of Hezbollah’s missile and rocket array, Ibrahim Qubaisi, on Tuesday in Beirut. The danger of an all-out war breaking out is thus clear, and the State Department is telling U.S. citizens that they should use any means available to get out, for their own safety. 'Due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and recent explosions throughout Lebanon, including Beirut, the US Embassy urges US citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,' it said in a new travel advisory Monday. The U.S. already has considerable forces in the region, including an aircraft carrier strike group. On Monday Ryder also announced, without giving any more details, that 'In light of increased tensions in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel' to augment those already in place. In August, after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran credited to Israel and the IDF’s admitted hit on Hezbollah chief of staff Fuad Shukr, tensions had also risen to the extent that the U.S. embassy in Beirut 'encouraged' its citizens in Lebanon to 'book any ticket available to them.'

Biden opposed to Israeli attacks on Hezbollah – report	Differing with Israel, the Biden administration still believes a diplomatic solution is the best way to de-escalate from possibility of regional war. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration has quietly opposed Israel’s recent attacks on Hezbollah, despite not airing any sharp public criticism, Politico reported Wednesday. American officials had warned their Israeli counterparts before Israel’s massive aerial assault on Hezbollah targets began Saturday would put a halt to diplomatic moves that they still believed was the best way to de-escalate a situation in which Hezbollah has launched some 9,000 missiles, rockets and UAVs at Israeli communities over the last year and some 60,000 Israelis are still evacuated from their border homes as a result. The fear, as expressed by President Joe Biden in his speech Tuesday at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, is that the military escalation could quickly lead to a region-wide conflict, something the U.S. has no desire for. 'Full-scale war is not in anyone’s interest,' Biden said in his speech. 'The situation has escalated&#8230;. A solution is still possible. In fact, it remains the only path to lasting security and to allow the residents of both countries to return to their homes.' According to the report, Jerusalem is not against a diplomatic solution to the crisis, having agreed for months to limit its retaliations for the indiscriminate aerial assaults on its sovereignty in order to give negotiations a chance. The decision was finally made to differ with the Americans as to how to achieve a resolution. The report said that during his trip to Jerusalem last week, the Israelis told U.S. Special Envoy Amos Hochstein that 'Hezbollah had shown no signs of wanting to engage in serious diplomatic talks and that Israel was set to ramp up the pressure on the group.' Politico also cited an Israeli official who said that in their discussions on the issue, the Biden administration was told that now was the time for the Jewish state to 'escalate [in order] to de-escalate.' The report said that American opinions are divided on the efficacy of the military pressure, with several defense and intelligence officials saying they don’t think it will drive Hezbollah to the negotiating table, but rather impel the Iranian terror proxy to up the ante. Despite the IDF recently saying it has been successful in destroying tens of thousands of Hezbollah rockets and much of its launch capabilities, the group still has many tens of thousands of projectiles in its arsenal, although its supply of the exponentially more dangerous precision-guided and cruise missiles is much more limited. Hezbollah also has the proven capability of carrying out terror attacks against Israeli and American targets around the world. In what may be a sign of hope that regional war is not yet at hand, Iran has signaled that it doesn’t want to engage Israel militarily right now. According to an Axios report, Tehran recently rejected a plea from its chief proxy to attack Israel directly, telling Hezbollah officials that 'the timing isn’t right.'

Hezbollah’s use of civilian homes sparks evacuation crisis and se...	In one incident in Beirut’s Christian suburb of Ain El Remmaneh, the Lebanese army was forced to step in when residents refused to accommodate Shiites from the south. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Sectarian tensions in Lebanon are soaring as tens of thousands of southern Lebanese residents flee their homes amid Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah. There have been numerous instances of Sunni and Christian residents in safer areas of the country refusing to host or rent displaced people from predominantly Shi’ite areas. Many suspect that members of Hezbollah are among the evacuees who would make their villages targets for Israeli intelligence. In one incident in Beirut’s Christian suburb of Ain El Remmaneh, the Lebanese army was forced to step in when residents refused to accommodate Shiites from the south. It was only after the army’s intervention that the displaced Shi’ites were evicted from homes they tried to take over. Hezbollah fears that the mass evacuation from the south will facilitate Israel’s creation of a buffer zone in the region. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon — all areas south of the Litani River — in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War. On Monday, Israel called on residents of southern Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley to flee homes where the Iran-backed Hezbollah stored missiles. The IDF disclosed that Hezbollah was preparing to launch a cruise missile hidden inside a civilian home. The army released footage, including of the airstrike that destroyed it. Sarit Zahavi, president and founder of the Alma Research Center, told The Press Service of Israel in August that Hezbollah doctrine makes extensive use of civilian homes. 'Hezbollah stores their weapons everywhere, both between villages and within the villages themselves,' she said. 'By and large, every third house in the Shi’ite villages of south Lebanon is used in some way by Hezbollah for military purposes, be it weapons storage, the entrance of a tunnel, or a launchpad for shooting rockets at Israel,' she explained. More than 60,000 residents of northern Israel were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. The Iran-backed terror group has launched more than 9,000 rockets and drones, killing 26 civilians and 22 soldiers on the Israeli side. Hezbollah leaders have said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes, which Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah reiterated in a speech on Thursday night.

Swing state voters trust Trump over Harris on foreign affairs: Po...	The poll, conducted from Aug. 15 to Aug. 22, was released the morning of President Joe Biden’s final address to the United Nations General Assembly. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Voters in six swing states trust former president Donald Trump more than Vice President Kamala Harris on key global policy concerns including the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, according to new polling from the Institute for Global Affairs. When asked who would more strongly defend U.S. interests abroad, respondents favored Trump over Harris 56 percent to 44 percent in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, according to the poll. Trump holds an even bigger lead—58 percent to 42 percent—in the same states on more specific foreign policy questions, such as who is more likely to end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine as well as who is more likely to respond effectively if China takes action against Taiwan. The poll, conducted from Aug. 15 to Aug. 22, was released the morning of President Joe Biden’s final address to the United Nations General Assembly. From its botched 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal to the ongoing war in Ukraine to rapidly escalating tensions in the Middle East, the Biden-Harris administration has led 'the worst decline in world order and the largest decline in U.S. influence, since the 1930s,' the Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote on Monday. 'It is a far more dangerous world than Mr. Biden inherited, and far less congenial for U.S. interests, human freedom and democracy,' the Journal’s editorial board continued. 'Authoritarians have advanced on his watch in every part of the world—Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and even the Americas.' The conflicts could spell trouble for Harris, who has struggled to distance herself from her boss's weak record and define her own foreign policy platform. Trump, however, has been bombarding swing state voters with foreign policy messaging for months, which could be responsible for his advantage, Mark Hannah, a senior fellow at the Institute for Global Affairs, told Axios. 'We've seen that independents in battleground states tend to prefer a less interventionist foreign policy. So the fact that voters see Trump as more likely to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza might strengthen his popularity,' Hannah added.

Ballistic missile attack on Tel Aviv	Lebanese terror group attacked Mossad headquarters in central Israel with Qader 1 ballistic missile. By World Israel News Staff A ballistic missile was launched from Lebanon towards the Tel Aviv metropolitan area in central Israel Wednesday morning, the Israeli military announced. Early Wednesday morning, a surface-to-surface ballistic missile launch was detected in the southern Lebanese town of Nafakhiyeh, an IDF spokesperson said. At 6:30 a.m., warning sirens sounded across the coastal plain of central Israel, from Tel Aviv to Ramat Gan and Netanya, marking the first time since the outbreak of fighting with Hezbollah last October that a projectile has been launched from Lebanon towards the central coast. The IDF said Wednesday that the incoming ballistic missile was successfully intercepted and destroyed by the David's Sling air defense system. No injuries or damage were reported in the attack. Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack, identifying the missile used as a version of the Ghadr-1, an Iranian-made medium-range missile originally designed for naval warfare. The Iranian-backed Shi'ite terror group said it had targeted Mossad headquarters near Tel Aviv, as a reprisal for last week's pager and radio attacks which targeted Hezbollah operatives. Dozens were killed and thousands injured last Tuesday and Wednesday when pagers and hand-held radios distributed by Hezbollah to its members simultaneously detonated in three separate attacks. Wednesday morning's missile attack came several hours after the Israeli Air Force bombed a Hezbollah weapons cache south of Beirut. Shortly after the missile launch, the IDF said, Israeli warplanes struck the launching pad used in the attack.

‘Leave now ‘ – 700 UK troops to aid Lebanon evacuation	It's important we be clear - now is the time to leave,' says UK Prime Minister, addressing Britons in Lebanon. By World Israel News Staff The UK government announced that 700 British army soldiers will be deployed to Cyprus to assist in the immediate evacuation of British citizens from Lebanon. Cyprus, an island nation in the Mediterranean, is a 30-minute flight from Lebanon, and can also be reached by boat in some 12 hours. There are some 10,000 British nationals thought to currently be present in Lebanon. Military personnel will be supported by Border Force and Foreign Office officials, the government added in a statement. The Royal Air Force is also dispatching aircraft and helicopters to the region. 'It is important that we be really, really clear: now is the time for [UK citizens] to leave' Lebanon, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. Starmer added that the government is 'ramping up the contingency plans' for repatriating British citizens from Lebanon 'in light of the escalation' between Hezbollah and Israel, he added. 'Events in the past hours and days have demonstrated how volatile this situation is, which is why our message is clear, British nationals should leave now,' said Defense Secretary John Healey. 'We continue to urge all sides to step back from conflict to prevent further tragic loss of life. Our government is ensuring all preparations are in place to support British nationals should the situation deteriorate. I want to thank the British personnel who are deploying in the region for their commitment and professionalism.' Following the Hezbollah beeper explosions last week, Foreign Secretary David Lammy urged UK citizens to depart the country. 'My message to British nationals in Lebanon is leave while commercial options remain,' he wrote on X last Thursday. 'Tensions are high and the situation could deteriorate rapidly.' The UK government 'continues to advise against all travel to Lebanon,' according to its website.

‘Maybe later’ – Iran ignores Hezbollah plea to attack Israel: Rep...	Iran claims 'timing isn't right' for attack on Israel, as IDF pummels Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Iran recently rebuffed a request from its proxy group Hezbollah to attack Israel, as fighting intensified between the terror group and the Israeli military. In recent days, Israel has struck thousands of weapons warehouses and other military assets, killing more than 500 people - most of them believed to be affiliated with Hezbollah. The Israeli air force has repeatedly bombed Dahiyeh, a Beirut suburb and Hezbollah stronghold, assassinating high-profile Hezbollah figures and humiliating the terror group. According to an Axios report, a battered Hezbollah recently turned to its patron and asked Iran to directly attack Israel. Israeli intelligence officials told Axios that Iran had refused the request. Iranian officials reportedly told their Hezbollah contacts that 'the timing isn't right' for an attack on Israel, because Iranian President Mahmoud Pezeshkian is currently in New York for the UN General Assembly. Publicly, Pezeshkian pledged that Iran would continue to support Hezbolah in its war against Israel. 'Hezbollah cannot stand alone against a country that is being defended and supported and supplied by Western countries, by European countries and the United States,' he told CNN. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Pezeshkian claimed that Israel is the source of instability in the Middle East and that Iran is not interested in war. 'We don’t want to fight,' Pezeshkian claimed. 'It’s Israel that wants to drag everyone into war and destabilize the region. … They are dragging us to a point where we do not wish to go.' Israel’s intensification of its military campaign against the Hezbollah terror group, in which Iran has invested untold funds, training, and arms, appears to sparked panic among Iran’s leadership. However, Tehran likely wishes to avoid directly attacking Israel, because doing so would give the IDF legitimacy to bomb Iran's nuclear sites.

Iran plotting to assassinate Trump	Top Trump campaign official says the former president was briefed by Biden administration about 'real and specific threats' of an assassination plot by Iran, part of larger campaign to 'sow chaos.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President Donald Trump is the target of an assassination plot directed by the Iranian government, a senior Trump 2024 campaign official said late Tuesday night. In a statement to the press, Trump Campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung said the former president and 2024 Republican presidential nominee had been briefed earlier on Tuesday by the Biden administration about what Cheung described as 'real and specific threats' by the regime in Tehran to assassinate Trump. 'President Trump was briefed earlier today by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence regarding real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States,' Cheung said. 'Intelligence officials have identified that these continued and coordinated attacks have heightened in the past few months, and law enforcement officials across all agencies are working to ensure President Trump is protected and the election is free from interference.' 'Make no mistake, the terror regime in Iran loves the weakness of Kamala Harris, and is terrified of the strength and resolve of President Trump.

Netanyahu says Israel’s military will blow up Lebanese homes that...	Netanyahu to Lebanese civilians; 'Free yourselves from Hezbollah's grip; free yourselves from Nasrallah's grip, for your own benefit.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, when Israel made 1,600 strikes in Lebanon against terror targets, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Lebanese civilians to evacuate sensitive areas and declared, 'We will continue to strike Hezbollah.' Netanyahu's remarks came Tuesday after a security briefing with the head of Military Intelligence, Major General Shlomi Binder, and from the commander of the SIGINT force Unit 8200, Brigadier General Yossi Sari'el. Netanyahu began by praising the military's operations against Hezbollah and said, 'I must say that I am deeply impressed by the work that has been done, and I am no less impressed by the work that will be done. We will continue to strike Hezbollah.' Emphasizing a statement, Netanyahu made on Monday to Lebanese civilians; the premier said, 'Our war is not with you; our war is with Hezbollah. Nasrallah is leading you to the brink of the abyss.' He once again warned civilians to evacuate crucial areas and to leave their homes if they are hiding weapons because Israel's military will not hesitate to strike if ammunition, military supplies, or terrorists are embedded in civilian homes. 'I told you yesterday to evacuate the homes where he has placed a missile in your living room and a rocket in your garage. Whoever has a missile in their living room and a rocket in their garage will not have a home,' he said. He urged Lebanese civilians to break free from Hezbollah; ''Free yourselves from Hezbollah's grip; free yourselves from Nasrallah's grip, for your own benefit.' Although some world leaders are calling for 'restraint' as Israel defends itself against Hezbollah's escalation of the conflict on Sunday and firing hundreds of rockets deep into Israel, Netanyahu defended Israel's right to make preemptive strikes against clear terror targets. 'For those who still do not understand, I want to clarify Israel's policy - we do not wait for the threat; we preempt it. Anywhere, in any arena, at any time. We eliminate senior officials, eliminate terrorists, eliminate missiles - and we are far from finished.'

Israeli fighter jets hit 1,600 Hezbollah terror targets in Lebano...	The IDF instructed civilians to move away from homes where Hezbollah has stored munitions. By Joshua Marks, JNS The Israeli Air Force struck over 1,600 Hezbollah targets in Southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley over the past 24 hours as part of 'Operation Northern Arrows,' according to the Israeli military. Among the targets hit was a terror cell that launched 20 rockets in three barrages at the Afula and HaAmakim areas in northern Israel overnight Monday. The launchers used in those attacks were also destroyed. Also overnight, Israel Defense Forces artillery and tanks struck additional Hezbollah targets in the area of Ayta ash Shab and Ramyeh in Southern Lebanon. The overnight strikes came after Monday’s massive Israeli aerial offensive, during which fighter jets hit rocket launchers, command posts and structures, including civilian residences, used by Hezbollah to store munitions. According to the Lebanese Health Ministry, 558 people were killed and 1,835 were wounded in the Israeli attacks. The ministry’s figures did not distinguish between combatants and noncombatants. Thousands of Lebanese have evacuated from the south as Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah terror targets intensifies after the IDF instructed civilians to move away from homes where Hezbollah has stored munitions. In addition to Southern Lebanon, the IAF continued striking Hezbollah terror targets in the Bekaa Valley deep inside Lebanese territory on Tuesday morning. Hezbollah continued to launch rocket attacks on Tuesday, firing more than 100 rockets at northern Israel and causing multiple injuries, including a 25-year-old man moderately wounded by shrapnel during a barrage towards the Mount Carmel area. Sirens sounded in the northern Israeli coastal city of Nahariya and surrounding areas. Two rockets from Lebanon fell into the sea, according to the IDF. There were no injuries or damage. Rocket alerts were also heard in communities in the Galilee region and near the large port city of Haifa. Rocket fire was reported in Afula and Nazareth. A 58-year-old woman was lightly injured by shrapnel in the Druze village of Yarka in the Western Galilee, according to the Magen David Adom emergency service. She was transported to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya along with a 61-year-old man suffering from anxiety. They were both sitting in a car. MDA teams were also treating several people injured on their way to shelters and additional anxiety cases. Also, a supermarket was reportedly damaged by shrapnel in the Arab town of Tamra in the Lower Galilee and several fires were reported following a heavy barrage in the area of Kiryat Shmona, including blazes at municipal warehouses. The evacuated border town has been continuously targeted over the past year. Sirens were also activated in Tel Hai, Kfar Giladi, Metula, and other towns in the region. Since Friday, Hezbollah has launched hundreds of rockets at Israel, forcing over a million people to run to bomb shelters. On Monday, Iran’s Lebanese terror proxy fired deeper into Israeli territory than it had since joining the war in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, including at Haifa and northern Samaria. Hezbollah has fired more than 8,800 rockets, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) toward Israel since Oct. 8. The strikes have forced over 60,000 Israelis to evacuate from northern communities, severely impacting daily life in the region. Jerusalem has ramped up its rhetoric and escalated attacks on Hezbollah since recently adding the return of residents to the north as an official war goal. The government on Monday evening approved the declaration of a 'special emergency situation' countrywide, granting authorities more powers to ensure the safety of the civilian population. The declaration will expire after 48 hours unless extended by Cabinet ministers. There were no specific changes to the Home Front Command instructions for areas of Israel outside of the northern region. However, there were changes to some border area communities, with no in-person educational activities in the Megido area, Yokneam Illit, Daliyat al-Karmel and Isfiya. The IDF Home Front Command had already cancelled school for communities from Haifa northwards. Meanwhile, foreign airlines continue to suspend flights to and from Ben Gurion Airport. Wizz Air, British Airways and Azerbaijan Airlines canceled flights on Tuesday. The Lufthansa Group, which includes Lufthansa Airlines, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Eurowings, announced on Monday that it was extending its suspension of flights to Ben Gurion Airport until Oct. 14. On Monday night, the IDF provided video and photographic documentation of how Hezbollah stores munitions inside the homes of civilians in Southern Lebanon, including images of a long-range missile on a hydraulic system in the attic of a home in the village of Houmine al-Tahta. 'It is ready to launch from an opening in the roof. Under the attic, on the first floor, a Lebanese family lives, serving as a human shield,' IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a press conference. 'This is an immediate and real threat to Israeli civilians, and we have an obligation to remove it,' he added. Also, the IDF released video footage of an airstrike against a Lebanese home where Hezbollah had stored munitions. The video shows a rocket flying out of the building after the strike and hitting an adjacent house.

‘I know Matan is alive with 10 others underground,’ hostage’s mot...	Einav Zangauker: 'In my opinion, there are no more than 30 to 35 hostages still alive.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Einav Zangauker, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, said in an interview with Reshet Bet on Tuesday morning that she believes her son is alive and is being held underground with ten other hostages. Zangauker said she receives regular updates, and according to the most recent one, she concludes her son is still alive and is confined underground, most likely in Gaza's extensive tunnels. 'I know that Matan is held with less than 10 other hostages that are also alive, and the fear is great,' she said in the interview. She continued, 'Therefore, it is an urgent task to save those still alive.' Zangauker also said it is imperative to bring the bodies of the fallen soldiers and slain hostages back to Israel so their families can have closure. She expressed concern that with the conflict escalating in the north, the hostages and their families will be forgotten. Acknowledging there are no easy answers, she said, 'We as hostage families would like to see a diplomatic solution to the conflict on the northern front so we can focus on returning the hostages.' Then again, she added that Israelis in the north can't be expected to tolerate constant attacks without a strong military response. Zangauker expressed skepticism concerning Israeli Prime Minister's comments earlier in the week that 50 of the 97 hostage held in Gaza are still alive. She told Army radio Monday, 'The prime minister is lying. We know, the families, that the number is far smaller than the number cited by the prime minister.' She added that the families of hostages receive intelligence and updates from the military and this information, she concludes that 'in my opinion, there are no more than 30 to 35 hostage still alive.' 'There are no [significant] contacts between the Israeli team and the mediators,' she said, and 'Hamas is not involved.' The Americans, preoccupied with the upcoming elections, basically 'given up' their efforts, at least for the time being.

Beirut strike: IDF kills head of Hezbollah’s missile array	The top terrorist also planned the October 2000 kidnapping of IDF Staff Sgts. Benny Avraham, Adi Avitan and Omar Souad from the Mount Dov border area. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS The Israel Defense Forces on Tuesday afternoon carried out a second precision strike in Beirut’s Dahiyeh district in as many days, killing Ibrahim Qubaisi, who heads Hezbollah’s missile and rocket array. The strike came less than 24 hours after the attempted assassination of Hezbollah’s No. 3 terrorist commander, Ali Karaki, in the same area. Qubaisi joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and held a series of key positions in the terror organization, according to the IDF. As part of his role, he 'was responsible for the planning and execution of many terrorist actions against the IDF forces and Israeli citizens,' the army said. 'Qubaisi commanded Hezbollah’s various missile units, including the precision missile units. Over the years and during the [current] war, he was responsible for launches towards the Israeli home front. Qubaisi was a central source of knowledge in the field of missiles and was close to the senior military leadership of Hezbollah,' the IDF continued. The top terrorist also planned the October 2000 kidnapping of IDF Staff Sgts. Benny Avraham, Adi Avitan and Omar Souad from the Mount Dov border area. The soldiers were killed by their captors either during or shortly after their abduction, and their remains were only returned to Israel four years later as part of a terrorist release deal with Hezbollah. According to the Israeli military, Qubaisi was surrounded by 'other key commanders in Hezbollah’s missile and rocket array' when the attack was launched. At least five other people were killed and several more were injured in the airstrike, according to initial Lebanese reports. ברייקינג: צה'ל תקף באופן ממוקד ברובע הדחייה בביירות pic.twitter.com/jke51sMFfx &mdash; איתי בלומנטל Itay Blumental (@ItayBlumental) September 24, 2024 Aftermath of strike in BEIRUT pic.twitter.com/NRArOU6oZJ &mdash; Open Source Intel (@Osint613) September 24, 2024 Following the strike in Beirut, Hezbollah launched a massive rocket barrage at Israel’s north, triggering air-raid sirens, including in the Upper Galilee city of Safed. No injuries were reported in the attacks. Israel’s Channel 12 said that more than 100 projectiles were launched at the Jewish state within one hour, with the Golan Regional Council telling residents to stay near bomb shelters and avoid public gatherings. 𝗜𝗦𝗥𝗔𝗘𝗟 𝗨𝗡𝗗𝗘𝗥 𝗔𝗧𝗧𝗔𝗖𝗞 | Israeli media describing the sky over Safed as 'total madness' right now pic.twitter.com/smTV6IxJhc &mdash; Jewish News Syndicate (@JNS_org) September 24, 2024 Tuesday’s aerial attack marked the fifth time that the Israeli army struck the Lebanese capital since Hezbollah joined the war against the Jewish state in support of Palestinian Hamas in the wake of the Oct. 7 massacre. On Monday night, Israeli Air Force jets targeted Karaki, Hezbollah’s highest-ranking remaining commander following Friday’s targeted killing of Ibrahim Aqil. Karaki commands Hezbollah’s southern front, which is responsible for the terror army’s cross-border attacks on Israel. In an official statement issued three hours after the strike, Hezbollah claimed that the top terrorist was still alive and 'moved to a safe place.' Unnamed Israeli officials told Israel Hayom on Tuesday that Karaki survived the strike, saying that the use of smaller bombs with the goal of minimizing civilian casualties contributed to the operation’s failure. On Friday, the IDF took credit for a targeted airstrike in the Dahiyeh neighborhood that killed more than a dozen senior Hezbollah terrorist officials, including Aqil, who was also wanted by the United States over his involvement in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut. On July 30, Israeli Air Force fighter jets carried out a targeted killing in south Beirut of Hezbollah’s No. 2 'military' commander, Fuad Shukr. Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, 2023, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones. The attacks have killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage. Tens of thousands of Israeli civilians remain internally displaced due to the violence. Throughout the day on Tuesday, the Israeli Air Force struck over 1,600 Hezbollah terror targets in Southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley as part of 'Operation Northern Arrows,' according to the Israeli military. Jerusalem has escalated attacks on Hezbollah since adding the return of evacuated Israeli civilians to the north as an official war goal on Sept. 17.

Biden not giving up on Gaza ceasefire, hostages, White House says	Biden will huddle with world leaders gathered in New York to work on a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. By The Algemeiner and Reuters US President Joe Biden is determined to bring about a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas while also seeking to de-escalate tensions on Israel’s border with Lebanon, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday. 'He absolutely hasn’t given up,' Sullivan said in an interview with MSNBC hours before Biden addresses the UN General Assembly for the last time as president. Biden will huddle with world leaders gathered in New York to work on a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza and avert an all-out war in the Middle East, Sullivan said. He acknowledged challenges in getting both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar across the line and said Hamas and Sinwar in particular 'don’t want to do a deal.' 'But we’re determined to keep at it,' Sullivan said. The United States has worked to contain tensions in the region since Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel in which the Palestinian terror group murdered 1,200 people and kidnapped 251 hostages. Israel responded with an ongoing military campaign in neighboring Hamas-ruled Gaza aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. The simmering conflict with Hezbollah at Israel’s northern border has spiked on and off since Oct. 7 and it is spiking now, he said. 'But we have averted it in those previous spikes, and I believe that we can still find a path forward to get de-escalation between Israel and across that northern border between Israel and Lebanon and bring about a diplomatic solution that allows people to return to their home,' Sullivan said.

Voters agree: Calling Trump a ‘threat to democracy’ prompts polit...	The poll found that even over a third of 'liberal' respondents agreed that calling Trump a 'threat to democracy' led to the attempts on his life. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon The majority of voters agree that 'irresponsible rhetoric,' such as calling a political adversary a 'threat to democracy,' has led to the recent assassination attempts on former president Donald Trump. The poll, conducted by the Senate Opportunity Fund, found that 57 percent of voters somewhat or strongly agree that 'labeling a political opponent a threat to democracy is irresponsible rhetoric which leads to political violence, like assassination attempts.' The poll comes just a week after authorities arrested the suspect in the second attempt on Trump's life in less than two months. Republicans, including Trump, have blamed the multiple assassination attempts against the former president on Democrats' claims that Trump is a 'threat to democracy.' Most voters align with Republicans' views on the issue, the poll found. The poll found that even over a third of 'liberal' respondents agreed that calling Trump a 'threat to democracy' led to the attempts on his life. Half of 'moderate' voters and 79 percent of 'conservative' respondents agreed this kind of language leads to political violence. The most recent would-be assassin, Ryan Wesley Routh, often reiterated Democrats' claim that Trump is an 'existential threat' to American 'democracy.' 'Democracy is on the ballot' this year, and 'we cannot lose,' Routh posted on social media, echoing the anti-Trump rhetoric used by Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden. On Sept. 15, Routh pushed the muzzle of an AK-47 through the perimeter of Trump's West Palm Beach golf course in Florida, hoping to take the former president's life. Before he got a shot off, a Secret Service agent saw Routh's barrel and fired multiple shots, forcing Routh to flee the course. He was soon arrested. Democrats and the mainstream media, however, have not only downplayed Routh's assassination attempt but also blamed Trump for inciting violence against himself. Former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile, for example, authored a piece in The Hill titled 'Trump's Rhetoric Has Caused Violence, Not Democrats Calling Him a Threat to Democracy,' while ABC News published the headline 'Trump Blames Democrats for Heated Environment Despite His Own Inflammatory Rhetoric.' Even after two assassination attempts on Trump, Democrats have continued to call their chief political opponent a 'threat to democracy.' Just one day after the second assassination attempt, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton told MSNBC that Trump is a 'danger to our country and the world.' Similarly, on Monday morning, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said that Trump was absolutely a 'threat to democracy.' The first attempt on Trump's life was on July 13 at a Pennsylvania rally. The gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, killed one attendee and wounded three others, including Trump, before being killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.

Police break up Hamas money-laundering ring in Jerusalem	During the raid, law enforcement confiscated over 200,000 shekels in cash, checks worth one million shekels, and various electronics. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli authorities arrested five suspected Hamas operatives on the outskirts of Jerusalem in an operation targeting individuals involved in financing and laundering funds for the terror group, the Israeli Police said on Tuesday. The primary suspect, believed to be a key figure in Hamas, was arrested in the Shuafat refugee camp in eastern Jerusalem. Authorities allege that the suspect and others have been using a chain of supermarkets in the Shuafat and Anata refugee camps to funnel money into Hamas’s activities. During the raid, law enforcement confiscated over 200,000 shekels ($53,000) in cash, checks worth one million shekels ($265,000), numerous cell phones, documents, DVRs, construction plans, tablets, and computer drives, along with several bags of business receipts linked to the laundering of terrorist funds. All five suspects, along with the seized materials, have been handed over to the Jerusalem Police and the Tax Authority for further investigation. Since October 7, Israel has arrested around 5,261 Palestinian terror suspects in Judea and Samaria, of whom 2,070 of whom are associated with Hamas.

In General Assembly speech, UN head takes shots at Israel	The U.N. head also questioned how the world could 'accept a one-state future that includes such a large number of Palestinians without any freedom, rights or dignity?' By Mike Wagenheim, JNS António Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, opened the U.N. General Assembly’s high-level debate week by repeatedly criticizing the Jewish state. Complaining of a 'world of impunity,' Guterres assessed that 'a growing number of governments and others feel entitled to a ‘get out of jail free’ card.' 'They can trample international law. They can violate the United Nations charter,' he said on Tuesday. 'They can turn a blind eye to international human rights conventions or the decisions of international courts.' 'We see this age of impunity everywhere,' including in the Middle East, Guterres added. The secretary-general, who is largely persona non grata to Israeli diplomats due to what pro-Israel critics largely view as his justification of the Hamas’s terrorist attacks, murder and atrocities in southern Israel on Oct. 7 and his repeated critiques of Israeli military operations in response to attacks from Hamas, Hezbollah and others. He has said that Hamas’s attack didn’t occur 'in a vacuum.' Guterres said that Gaza 'is a nonstop nightmare that threatens to take the entire region with it,' adding, 'look no further than Lebanon. We must do everything in our power to prevent Lebanon from becoming another Gaza.' 'Nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. The speed and scale of the killing and destruction in Gaza are unlike anything in my years as secretary-general,' he added. 'More than 200 of our own staff have been killed, many with their families.' The U.N. head did not mention that internationally-designated terror groups control both Lebanon and Gaza, and that those groups attacked Israel, launching the nearly year-long conflict in the region. 'Nothing can justify the abhorrent acts of terror committed by Hamas on Oct. 7 or the taking of hostages—both of which I have repeatedly condemned,' Guterres said. Guterres called on the international community to 'mobilize for an immediate ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and the beginning of an irreversible process towards a two-state solution.' 'For those who go on undermining that goal with more settlements, more land grabs, more incitement—I ask: What is the alternative?' he said on Tuesday. The U.N. head also questioned how the world could 'accept a one-state future that includes such a large number of Palestinians without any freedom, rights or dignity?' In his speech, Guterres did not mention Israeli security concerns.

‘What a Joke!’ – Netanyahu rips ICC prosecutor for meeting Erdoga...	Only at the UN' - International Criminal Court chief prosecutor meets with Turkey's president and chief of the Palestinian Authority, drawing sharp criticism from Israeli premier facing arrest warrants from the ICC. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Monday. While Khan has already formally issued a request for international arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, accusing both of war crimes in the ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, Erdogan called on Khan to take additional steps against Israel, accusing the Jewish state of plotting to 'add new massacres to their list.' 'It is extremely important for the genocide case filed against Israel at the International Criminal Court to be concluded and for the perpetrators of genocide to receive the punishment they deserve,' Erdogan told Khan, according to a statement issued by Erdogan's office. In a separate meeting, Abbas called on Khan to 'expedite investigations into Israeli war crimes,' and urged steps be taken to prevent future 'crimes against the Palestinian people.' On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Abbas and Erdogan, while taking aim at Khan for meeting with the two leaders. 'Under the category of 'This can only happen at the UN',' Netanyahu said, highlighting Abbas' past comments questioning the scope and nature of the Holocaust, and Turkish policies vis-a-vis the Kurdish minority. 'ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan met yesterday with two great champions of human rights – Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, renowned for slaughtering Kurdish civilians and jailing journalists, and with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who denies the Holocaust and pays terrorists who murder Jews.' 'Rather than issuing arrest warrants for war crimes against Erdogan and Abbas, Khan remains obsessed with casting as war criminals Israel's democratically elected leaders, who are pursuing a just war with just means against genocidal terrorists.

‘Israel is a climate justice issue’ – Greta Thunberg dons keffiye...	Swedish climate activist calls for boycott of Chevron over its ties to Israel, while accusing Israel of 'genocide' in the Gaza Strip. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg took aim at Israel at a recent protest in Stockholm, while advocating in favor of the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, calling for the boycott of an energy company over its ties to the Jewish state. On Saturday, Thunberg took part in an anti-Israel rally in the Swedish capital, joining some 5,000 protesters who gathered to condemn Israel's ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 'Israel’s genocide in Palestine is outrageous,' Thunberg told the Anadolu Agency. 'It is sad to see how people do not understand and realise what is happening in Palestine and go on with their lives without caring.' Two days later, Thunberg tweeted photos from the event, including one of her addressing the rally while wearing a keffiyeh. 'We stand united across our struggles to fight together for a common goal; a world that puts people and planet before profit,' Thunberg tweeted. 'One group’s fight is everyone’s fight, because no one is free until everyone is free. As climate justice activists we also fight for justice and liberation for all oppressed and colonised peoples.' Early Tuesday morning, Thunberg took to Instagram to promote an anti-Israel boycott of the Chevron corporation, over the oil giant's financial ties to the Jewish state. 'The oil giant is also fueling Israel's genocide in Palestine. As Israel bombs hospitals, homes, and schools in Gaza, Chevron supplies them with energy,' Thunberg said in a video statement. 'Ending Israel's genocide in Gaza and Israeli apartheid is a climate justice issue. Israel is destroying Palestinian lives, but also destroying Palestinian lands and resources.' Thunberg also posted a statement condemning the U.S. and the Biden administration over Israel's pager bombings against Hezbollah terrorists, and recent air campaign against Hezbollah missile depots in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley. 'Instead of ending genocide after 12 months, we have the beginning of war in Lebanon,' the statement reads. 'All enabled by the Biden Administration, which emboldened state-sponsored Israeli terror and warmongering without pause.' 'Has Harris condemned the pager terror attack, or today's murder of 500 civilians? Let me be clear, the US and ISrael see Palestinians and Lebanese as one in the same: Arabs worth of mass slaughter.'

Israeli man injured in Megiddo rocket attack	Hezbollah unleashes massive rocket barrage on Galilee, sparking fires across northern Israel which torched homes and warehouses. By World Israel News Staff Hezbollah terrorists operating in southern Lebanon fired roughly 100 rockets at the Galilee in northern Israel Tuesday morning and early afternoon, sparking multiple blazes and leaving at least one person injured. Beginning before dawn Tuesday and continuing into the afternoon, volleys of rockets were fired towards Israel, with the IDF confirming at least 100 launches. At approximately 1:10 p.m., shrapnel from a Hezbollah rocket injured a 19-year-old man in the northern town of Megiddo. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the victim before evacuating him to Haifa's Rambam Medical Center. 'We provided initial medical assistance at the scene to a young man, approximately 25 years old, who was moderately injured by shrapnel,' Itzhak Miro and Avraham Vazana, United Hatzalah EMTs, reported from the scene. 'He was then evacuated to Rambam Hospital in Haifa.' Rocket attacks earlier in the day on the northeastern Israeli city of Kiryat Shemona sparked fires which damaged a number of buildings. Six firefighting teams have been deployed to the city, according to the Israel Fire and Rescue Authority. Some 50 rockets were launched towards Kiryat Shemona Tuesday, with one projectile striking the local cemetery, causing heavy damage, Kan reported. Multiple fires have also been reported elsewhere across northern Israel, with some damage reported to private homes. Rockets also struck the western Galilee Tuesday morning, including one direct hit on Route 70, near the Arab-Israeli town of Tamra. The rocket strike did not cause injuries, but nearly struck passing vehicles, dashboard camera footage from the incident revealed. IDF forces responded with airstrikes against Hezbollah positions in the northern Beqaa Valley Tuesday, with airstrikes reported in Beirut Tuesday afternoon. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, a total of 558 people were killed and 1,835 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah positions since Monday morning.

IDF airstrikes ‘set Hezbollah back 20 years,’ says US official	We are the closest we've been to a regional war,' warns American official, as conflict between Israel and Hezbollah continues to escalate, with IDF airstrikes sending the terrorist group 'back 20 years.' By World Israel News Staff A massive wave of Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah missile and rocket depots across southern and eastern Lebanon Monday caused massive damage to the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group, an American official said, setting its operations back decades. Speaking with CNN in a report published Tuesday, a U.S. official said that a string of recent Israeli actions against Hezbollah have seriously degraded the terror group's operational capabilities. Last Tuesday and Wednesday, thousands of hand-held radios and pagers issued by Hezbollah to its operatives detonated simultaneously, killing dozens and injuring thousands. On Friday, an Israeli airstrike on a Hezbollah position in Beirut killed 16 members of the terror group's elite Radwan Force, including two of the unit's senior commanders. Yesterday, following a string of massive rocket attacks on northern Israel, Israel Air Force jets bombed hundreds of Hezbollah missile and rocket depots - many of them concealed in private homes - along the Israeli frontier in southern Lebanon and in eastern Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Lebanon's health ministry claimed that at least 492 died in the airstrikes, with 1,645 reported injured. 'They’ve probably been taken 20 years backwards,' a second U.S. official said after Monday's aerial campaign. Since its 2006 war with Israel, Hezbollah amassed a significant arsenal of rockets and missiles, ranging from shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles to cruise missiles. Prior to the outbreak of fighting on the Israel-Lebanon frontier on October 8th, Hamas is estimated to possess some 150,000 rockets and missiles in its stockpiles. Hezbollah rocket, missile, and mortar attacks on Israeli border towns have forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents of northern Israel, with some 70,000 Israeli citizens still internally displaced.

Arab-Israeli pharmacist outed as ISIS terrorist	A young customer had noticed the man wearing a ring bearing the Muslim terror group’s symbol. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A Petah Tikva pharmacist was arrested Monday on suspicion of supporting the Islamic State in Syria (ISIS) terror organization after a vigilant customer saw him wearing a ring with the group’s symbol. The young man had come in the evening to the pharmacy, located in one of the city’s malls, to get some medicine, and saw the ring as he handed the man the prescription. He managed to take a picture of the man’s hand with the ring and as soon as he left the pharmacy he called the police hotline and reported the incident. Upon receiving the report, the police told Maariv, officers 'arrived at the scene and detained the suspect.' The paper quoted 'officials exposed to the details' of the case as saying that 'Either this is a very serious case in which a supporter of the terrorist organization was walking around under the noses of the residents, or it is an insensitive pharmacist who these days allows himself to come [to work] with a ring with the terrorist organization's symbol prominently displayed.' 'We have hostages whose families are from Petah Tikva and [even] from the neighborhood in question,' they continued. 'We have soldiers who were murdered and those who fell in battle, and wearing such a ring is an event that requires an investigation.' The authorities are asking the court Tuesday to extend the suspect’s remand in custody so that their investigation can proceed effectively. The man is a resident of eastern Jerusalem, where police last month arrested a 16-year-old on suspicion of trying to recruit students in his high school to become members of ISIS in order to carry out terror attacks. The police investigation found that the teen had spread the extremist Muslims’ ideology and often glorified the group’s terrorist acts on social media. His classmates told the authorities that he had expressed a desire to carry out a car bomb attack himself, and threatened them that if they did not join ISIS, its men would kill them one day. Among the ISIS-related contents on the physics and electronics major’s phone, the police discovered a video on how to make bombs and commit sabotage, formulas for preparing explosives, and Islamic religious rulings favoring suicide attacks and the murder of innocents. After he was questioned, a prosecutor's statement was filed against him in preparation for an indictment.

Biden officials describe president’s ‘shouting matches’ with Neta...	Biden is taking aim at Netanyahu as administration officials express 'exasperation' over the Israeli government. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden has acknowledged that he is unlikely to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip between Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization, and administration officials are increasingly open about the president venting his frustrations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, The New York Times reported Monday. According to the report, which cited aides to the president, Biden is 'beginning to acknowledge' that with less than four months left in office, time is running out on a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. With few prospects for a breakthrough in the near future and amid growing fears of a second full-scale war in the region - this time between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group - Biden is said to be coming to grips with the fact that a deal is unlikely to be reached while he remains in office. Biden is taking aim at Netanyahu as administration officials express 'exasperation' over the Israeli government. According to the report, members of Biden's national security team do little to hide their frustrations regarding the Israeli premier, and openly discuss the president's 'shouting matches' with Netanyahu during telephone calls. U.S. envoy to the Middle East Dennis Ross, who was responsible for brokering interim agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority during the 1990s, told the Times that Netanyahu and Biden have fundamentally opposing views of Israel's goals in the war, with Netanyahu pursuing the removal of existential threats to the Jewish state, while Biden is seeking a path towards a comprehensive peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The two leaders, Ross continued, never agreed on the purpose or extent of the war against Hamas - much less the current conflict with Hezbollah - thus making the current friction inevitable.

Civilian effort to equip Israeli soldiers for war with Hezbollah ...	Hezbollah has its own drones, which fly into Israeli territory to drop bombs on Israeli positions, so soldiers are asking for special protective netting. By Asaf Elia-Shalev, JTA As tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have shot up to new highs, Israeli soldiers anticipating being deployed to the north are increasingly turning for help to the civilian donation efforts that have kept them stocked in Gaza. Adi Vaxman, who heads the U.S.-based donation effort called Operation Israel, fields requests from individual soldiers and says demand has spiked in tandem with security developments involving Hezbollah. 'With the situation up north, the demand has tripled in the last few days,' Vaxman told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency last week. She said the total requests by soldiers in September are on pace to reach double the roughly 15,000 requests from August. Civilian volunteers have been working for weeks to better understand the unique needs posed by the intensifying conflict in the north, which is taking place across a different terrain than Gaza and against Hezbollah, a group with more advanced capabilities than Hamas. After conversations with senior officers involved in military logistics, another civilian effort called the Discretionary Fund for Israel, which is led by Shalem College administrator Daniel Polisar, launched a $8 million fundraising drive earlier this month. The dollar figure comes from a calculation of what gear is needed — and which kind of items the military has recently procured. Drones, for example, were one of the most requested items from donors for many months, but the military is now distributing them in large numbers, according to Polisar. In a fundraising email, Polisar warned his donor pool that an escalation in the war was imminent and soldiers were not sufficiently supplied for what’s expected. 'I’m writing at one of the most difficult times Israel has faced since Hamas’s atrocities of October 7 precipitated a multi-front war,' Polisar wrote. 'The evolving situation has created grave new risks for the brave men and women defending our country.' Since the appeal went out, Polisar’s prediction has come much closer to reality. The Israeli cabinet has declared as a war aim the return of 60,000 Israelis displaced from their homes by Hezbollah’s rockets. Hundreds of pagers have exploded across Lebanon in attacks targeting Hezbollah operatives. Israel assassinated a top Hezbollah commander in an airstrike. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah declared Israel has 'crossed a red line.' And the Israeli military has redeployed a large fighting division from Gaza to the northern border. Over the weekend, tensions escalated sharply. Israel battered Hezbollah positions inside Lebanon, including in Beirut far from the border and of a meeting of Hezbollah commanders who Israel said were planning an Oct. 7-style invasion of the north. Meanwhile, Hezbollah sent dozens of rockets deep into Israeli territory, injuring several and sparking fires in populated areas. Whether the conflict evolves to include ground fighting remains to be seen. But Israeli soldiers worrying that any effort to secure the north would necessarily include an invasion have continued to request basic combat items like helmets and ceramic plates for body armor as they have done in Gaza — and donors have begun adding other kinds of equipment as well. The size of the battlefield in the north is larger than Gaza, which has been characterized by close-quarter urban combat. Drones must fly over longer ranges, which calls for different types of batteries and special antennas, according to Vaxman. Hezbollah has its own drones, which fly into Israeli territory to drop bombs on Israeli positions, so soldiers are asking for special protective netting. Weather is also a factor as winter months approach and temperatures drop, especially at high elevations. The uneven topography of northern Israel and southern Lebanon also makes it more difficult for the Israeli army to detect threats, which is why soldiers ask for special surveillance cameras. Jews in the Diaspora who have been asked repeatedly since Hamas’s attack last October to help buy soldiers combat gear have largely responded with an open checkbook, but they have also expressed alarm about the implication that the military cannot supply itself. Polisar received a wave of questions reflecting such concerns after his fundraising email and then addressed them in a follow-up message. His email noted the immense scale of hostilities Israel is facing and praised military leaders for ramping up their purchasing to meet billions of dollars in equipment needs. 'Even so, there are certain critical areas in which the IDF has not fully succeeded in rendering our soldiers as safe and effective as possible in the short time horizons dictated by war-time conditions,' Polisar wrote. 'In a perfect world, the Israeli army would take care of everything, my team and I would not need to raise funds and purchase gear, and I would not be asking you to consider once again stretching your limited resources.' In another possible sign of how serious the need for more equipment is, earlier efforts by the military to stop the flow of donations to individual units appear to have receded. In July, the commander of Israel’s ground forces, Tamir Yadai, warned his troops about rules against accepting donations and threatened heightened enforcement. He also called for officers to inventory all donated supplies and confiscate equipment that doesn’t match IDF standards. Yadai’s order had a chilling effect on donors, who feared that their contributions would go to waste, according to multiple fundraising groups. Since then, however, Yadai has resigned from the military. And officers are not taking action to stop donations, according to the civilian aid groups.

‘Israel must defeat Hezbollah, or face disaster’ – Ex-IDF col.	IDF has 'once-in-a-generation' opportunity to permanently defeat Hezbollah, says former colonel. By World Israel News Staff An ex-senior Israeli military official urged the IDF to leverage the 'rare opportunity' to permanently defeat the Hezbollah terror group, calling on the political echelon to make 'brave decisions' during the ongoing campaign. Israel must take decisive action to clear the threat on its northern border once and for all, retired Colonel Kobi Marom told Radio 103FM on Tuesday morning. Marom poured cold water on the possibility of increasing military pressure forcing Hezbollah to negotiate an end to the conflict. Hezbollah will 'not sit down for negotiations,' he said, pointing to nearly a year of talks that failed to produce a diplomatic solution. Instead, Marom said, Israel should focus on finally achieving a decisive victory over Hezbollah. 'There is a rare, once-in-a-generation opportunity here; it’s time for brave decisions,' Marom stressed. If Israel does not 'take advantage' of the current momentum, it would be a 'disaster for generations to come,' he continued. He warned that if the defense and political establishment does not choose the route of strengthening the intensity of the campaign against Hezbollah, 'the escalation cycles will continue, and we will enter a war of attrition - which is what the Iranians want.' According to Marom, an IDF ground invasion of southern Lebanon is necessary to drive Hezbollah north of the Litani River and ensure that displaced residents of Israel's north can safely return home. Conquering Lebanon south of the Litani 'is a mission the IDF can accomplish within two weeks,' he said. 'This is an opportunity we cannot miss.' Marom's message to the IDF, urging the military to deal a crushing blow to Hezbollah, comes hours after a Biden administration official said that Washington is floating various ceasefire proposals aimed at ending the conflict. The official would not elaborate on the details of the proposals, nor would eh explain how the differed from the agreement pushed by the U.S. for nearly a year, to no avail.

US sends additional forces to Middle East as Israel-Hezbollah ten...	Those US capabilities include the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group, fighter aircraft and air defenses. By The Algemiener and Reuters The United States is sending a small number of additional troops to the Middle East given escalating tensions between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the Pentagon said on Monday, declining to specify the precise number or mission of the deployed forces. 'Out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,' Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson, told reporters. After almost a year of war against Hamas in Gaza, Israel is shifting its focus to its northern frontier, where Hezbollah, a powerful Iran-backed terrorist organization, has been firing rockets into Israel in support of its ally Hamas. Israel‘s military on Monday struck Hezbollah in Lebanon’s south, eastern Bekaa valley, and northern region near Syria in its most widespread strikes. An Israeli strike on Monday evening on the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital targeted senior Hezbollah leader Ali Karaki, the head of the southern front, a security source told Reuters. US President Joe Biden’s administration has been seeking to contain the conflict to Gaza and has repeatedly called for the Israel-Lebanon border crisis to be resolved through diplomacy. That call for diplomacy has been underscored by US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in daily calls with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Experts question whether Iran would stay on the sidelines if Lebanon’s Hezbollah’s existence were threatened and say US troops could also find themselves targeted throughout the Middle East, if a regional war breaks out. In their call on Sunday, Austin suggested that no outside actors should intervene in the conflict. 'The secretary made clear that the United States remains postured to protect US forces and personnel and determined to deter any regional actors from exploiting the situation or expanding the conflict,' the Pentagon said in a statement. Those US capabilities include the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group, fighter aircraft and air defenses. 'We have more capability in the region today than we did on April 14th when Iran conducted its drone and missile attack against Israel,' Ryder said. 'So all of those forces combined provide us with the options to be able to protect our forces should they be attacked.' Ryder referred to Iran’s attack by more than 300 missiles and drones, which caused only modest damage inside Israel thanks to air defense interceptions from the United States, Britain, and other allies in the region. The April 14 strikes were Iran’s first-ever direct attack on Israel.

Prosecutors: Would-be killer plotted Trump assassination for mont...	Routh, who has a lengthy criminal record and exclusively donated to Democrats, regularly expressed anti-Trump sentiments, which were on full display in his letters. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon The man charged with the most recent assassination attempt on Donald Trump started plotting the attempt months before he pointed a rifle at the former president, according to federal prosecutors' Monday filing, which includes a chilling letter written by the suspect. Prosecutors said the suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, left a box—which contained ammunition, four phones, and letters—with an anonymous witness 'several months' before his September assassination attempt. After learning of the assassination attempt, the witness opened the box, according to the filing. 'Dear World, this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I am so sorry I failed you,' one letter reads. 'I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster.' The new filing revealed that Routh traveled from the Greensboro, N.C., area to West Palm Beach, Fla., on Aug. 14. Routh also staked out Trump's golf course and Mar-a-Lago estate for nearly a month in the lead-up to the incident, his phone record showed. On Sept. 15, Routh pushed the muzzle of an AK-47 through the perimeter of Trump's West Palm Beach golf course in Florida, hoping to take the former president's life. Before he got a shot off, a Secret Service agent saw Routh's barrel and fired multiple shots, forcing Routh to flee the course. He was soon arrested on Interstate 95. Expecting his assassination attempt to be unsuccessful, Routh in the letter offers a $150,000 reward to 'whomever can complete the job.' Routh's attempt came just two months after Thomas Matthew Crooks attempted to assassinate Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. Crooks killed one attendee and wounded three others, including Trump, before being killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper. Routh, who has a lengthy criminal record and exclusively donated to Democrats, regularly expressed anti-Trump sentiments, which were on full display in his letters. 'Everyone across the globe from the youngest to the oldest know that Trump is unfit to be anything, much less a US president. U.S. presidents must at bare minimum embody the moral fabric that is America and be kind, caring and selfless and always stand for humanity,' one letter reads. Routh allegedly camped at the golf course for around 12 hours before the Secret Service spotted him, prompting Martin County sheriff William Snyder to question whether Routh was part of a 'conspiracy' to kill the former president. 'I think that's the question the FBI, the Secret Service are laser-focused on today. Is this guy part of a conspiracy? Is he a lone gunman?' Snyder said. 'If he's part of a conspiracy, then this whole thing really takes on a very ominous tone.' Routh was charged last week with the possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and the possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.

Iranian president: ‘Israel dragging us into war we don’t want’	President Pezehskian claims Iran embraces peace and regional stability, despite funding proxy groups that repeatedly attacked Israel. By World Israel News Staff Iran's president claimed that Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah is forcing Tehran into the conflict, failing to acknowledge how the regime's proxies in the region have systematically attacked Israel for months. Speaking on Monday to reporters ahead of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, President Mahmoud Pezeshkian claimed that Iran is a peace-loving nation that seeks to stabilize the Middle East - despite the fact that Tehran has repeatedly threatened to destroy Israel. Blaming Israel for the ongoing fighting, Pezeshkian charged that Israel's attacks on Hezbollah were a 'trap' designed to draw Iran into the war. 'We don’t want to fight,' Pezeshkian said. 'It’s Israel that wants to drag everyone into war and destabilize the region. … They are dragging us to a point where we do not wish to go.' Pezeshkian's comments are directly contradicted by many public statements by other high-level Iranian officials in recent months, who have threatened on numerous occasions to annihilate Israel. Since October 7th, many of Iran's regional proxies have launched unprovoked attacks on Israel. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and based in Lebanon, has been firing near-daily missile, rocket, and explosive drone salvos at Israel for more than 11 months. The Yemen-based Houthis, also an Iranian proxy group, fired several explosive drones and ballistic missiles at Israel. Various Shia militia groups controlled by Iran, based in Syria and Iraq, have also launched drones towards Israel. Israel's intensification of its military campaign against the Hezbollah terror group, in which Iran has invested untold funds, training, and arms, appears to sparked panic among Iran's leadership. 'Israel’s crimes, enabled by the U.S., are crystal clear for the world to witness. Do not look away,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote on social media platform X on Monday. 'This brutal and criminal disregard for human life cannot be permitted to continue. Iran will NOT remain indifferent. We stand with the people of Lebanon and Palestine,' he added.

Top Palestinian official says Israel to experience a ‘New Oct. 7’...	Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, which provides the Islamist terror groups with weapons, funding, and training. By Algemeiner Staff A senior Palestinian official has boasted that Israel will soon suffer another large-scale massacre similar to the Palestinian terror group Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel — except this time the onslaught will come from southern Lebanon rather than Gaza. The warning from Hassan Khraisheh — deputy speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian Authority (PA) — came as tensions continued to skyrocket between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful terrorist organization based in Lebanon. 'We are living a new Oct. 7, but this time it is not in Gaza, but rather in the north of occupied Palestine, starting from southern Lebanon,' Khraisheh told Quds Press, according to a translation of his comments. The Islamic Republic News Agency, the official news agency of Iran, also reported on Khraisheh’s comments and translated them a bit differently: 'On Oct. 7, we will experience a new one, but this time, not in Gaza, but in the north of occupied Palestine and south of Lebanon.' Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, which provides the Islamist terror groups with weapons, funding, and training. It is unclear whether Khraisheh was claiming that another major attack would occur on Oct. 7 or more generally that another onslaught against the Jewish state was coming. Thousands of Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists invaded southern Israel from neighboring Gaza on Oct. 7 of last year, murdering 1,200 people, injuring thousands more, and kidnapping over 250 hostages. The terrorists perpetrated rampant sexual violence, including torture and gang-rape, against the Israeli people during the attack, the largest single-day massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. Israel responded with an ongoing military campaign in Hamas-ruled Gaza aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. Hamas leaders have vowed to carry out attacks against Israel similar to the Oct. 7 invasion 'again and again.' In recent months, however, as Israel has imposed devastating losses on Hamas in Gaza to the south, it has increasingly turned more of its attention northward to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hezbollah has fired barrages of rockets, missiles, and drones at northern Israel almost daily following the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Since then, both sides have been exchanging fire constantly while avoiding a major escalation as war rages in Gaza. More than 60,000 Israelis have been forced to evacuate their homes in northern Israel and flee to other parts of the country amid the unrelenting attacks from Hezbollah, which wields significant political and military influence across Lebanon. Israeli leaders have said they seek a diplomatic resolution to the conflict with Hezbollah along the border with Lebanon but are prepared to use large-scale military force if needed to ensure all citizens can safely return to their homes. Last week, Israel’s security cabinet expanded its war goals to include returning the displaced Israelis from the north. On Monday morning, Israeli fighter jets conducted massive airstrikes on Hezbollah targets across Lebanon to prevent the Iranian-backed terror army from firing rockets across the border. The strikes came after Hezbollah launched more than 100 rockets and drones at northern Israel in waves of attacks overnight on Saturday and Sunday morning. The Hezbollah barrage was in response to the thousands of pagers and walke-talkies used by Hezbollah terrorists that exploded in Lebanon last week. While Israel neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the sophisticated operation, Iran and Hezbollah blamed the Jewish state and vowed revenge. Several experts and media reports said Israeli intelligence was behind the blasts. According to Khraisheh, the Hezbollah strikes were a sign that Iran’s so-called 'axis of resistance' of terrorist proxies across the Middle East was in a winning position. '[It was] a response that confirms beyond any doubt that the axis of resistance is still strong,' he said. 'Those fighting with Palestine are our brothers in Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon, and this expresses the unity of the arenas that confuse the occupation [Israel].' Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Yemen’s Houthi terrorist group, which is also supported by Tehran, have all expressed support for Hamas and Hezbollah and in some cases launched attacks against Israel. Khraisheh also claimed that Israel was 'deepening its occupation' of the West Bank, urging all Palestinians to be united in opposing the Jewish state. The PA, which exercises limited self-governance over the West Bank, is a rival of Hamas. Still, PA officials have been regularly rationalizing Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel and in some cases even denying it took place or falsely claiming Israeli forces carried out the onslaught.

Mayor of Muslim-majority US city officially endorses Trump for Pr...	On Facebook, Ghalib posted a photo of himself standing alongside Trump, claiming that the pair met in person just days before. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The mayor of the only Muslim-majority city in the United States endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump over the weekend, potentially boosting the former US president’s chances of winning the critical swing state of Michigan this November. Amer Ghalib, mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, released a statement on Facebook on Sunday, praising Trump’s character and urging his residents to vote for the former president on Election Day. Ghalib also posted a photo of himself standing alongside Trump, claiming that the pair met in person just days before. 'I believe he is the right choice for this critical time,' Ghalib said of Trump, praising him as a 'man of principles.' 'I’ll not regret my decision no matter what the outcome would be, and I’m ready to face the consequences,' Ghalib added. The mayor told The Detroit News that Trump was already familiar with him prior to the sit-down. 'He knew a lot about me before the meeting,' Ghalib told the outlet. 'We talked about various topics including the debates, the polls updates, the statistics of votes in Michigan and Wayne County, the Arab American concerns and the Yemeni Americans in particular. We also talked about the situation in Yemen,' the mayor continued. The mayor added that during their private 20-minute meeting, Trump asked for an endorsement from him as he seeks to win the presidency and defeat Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. 'He asked me if I can endorse him and ask people to vote for him? I told him: ‘I’m here to talk about that and how we can make it happen,'' the mayor said. 'I then handed him an official letter with some details about our concerns and to invite him to come to Hamtramck if possible.' Ghalib did not specify whether he and Trump discussed the ongoing war in Gaza or placing an arms embargo on Israel, a demand that anti-Israel activists have made of Harris. Ghalib has a history of making racist and antisemitic statements online. He liked comments on social media that referred to African Americans as 'animalistic' and 'subhuman.' He also condemned Arab leaders as being covert 'Jews.' In a 2021 Facebook post defending Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, Ghalib told his Arab American followers to compare Trump with 'the leaders of your countries, who are willing to become Jewish if the president is Jewish and to abandon all national and religious reproach if ordered by the directorial dictator!' Nonetheless, the mayor’s endorsement could prove to be an asset for Trump as he continues to spar with Harris for votes in the hotly-contested swing state of Michigan. Moreover, many Arab American activists have expressed disillusionment and anger with Harris over her refusal to adopt hardline anti-Israel stances. The 'Uncommitted movement' — a coalition of Democratic delegates opposed to the Jewish state’s defensive military operations in Gaza — issued a statement last week announcing that the group would not endorse a candidate for the 2024 presidential election. The group criticized Harris for not agreeing to withhold weapons from Israel and slammed the Democratic National Convention (DNC) for not allowing a Palestinian-American speaker on the main-stage of the event. On the polling front, Harris has also struggled to coalesce the Arab American vote, an issue that could potentially puncture her chances of winning November’s election. Recent polls suggest that Jill Stein, the presidential nominee for the Green Party, holds a staggering lead over Harris among Arab American voters in Michigan. Stein, a Jewish woman, has repeatedly accused Israel of committing a 'genocide' in Gaza and has defended Hamas’s slaughter of roughly 1,200 people on Oct. 7 as an act of 'self-defense.'

US deploying ‘small number’ of new troops to Middle East, as Isra...	The United States currently has some 40,000 troops in the region, according to the Pentagon. By Andrew Bernard, JNS The United States is deploying additional troops to the Middle East amid heightened tensions in the region, the Pentagon announced on Monday. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, would not provide any details to the Associated Press about how many additional forces Washington would send or what their mission would be, the wire reported. 'In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional U.S. military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,' Ryder told the AP. 'For operational security reasons, I’m not going to comment on or provide specifics.' The United States currently has some 40,000 troops in the region, according to the Pentagon. On Monday, the aircraft carrier USS Truman, two destroyers and a cruiser departed from Norfolk, Va., towards the Mediterranean for a scheduled deployment. The new troop increase is the latest indication that the United States is concerned about a military escalation in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Israel and Lebanon. On Monday, the Israel Defense Forces struck more than 1,000 targets across Lebanon to prevent Hezbollah from firing rockets across the border. The U.S. State Department updated its travel advice for Lebanon on Saturday to urge U.S. citizens to depart the country while commercial flights remain available. The United States has advised Americans to not travel to Lebanon since July. In 2022, the State Department estimated that some 86,000 Americans live in Lebanon.

Senior Hezbollah official Ali Karaki killed in Beirut airstrike –...	Karaki was slated to replace Ibrahim Aqil as head of Hezbollah operations after the latter was killed on Friday. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, senior Hezbollah official Ali Karaki was targeted and killed by an airstrike in Beirut, Sky Arabia reports. Karaki, head of the terror group's Southern command, is the most senior Hezbollah official and was slated to replace Ibrahim Aqil as head of operations after the latter was killed on Friday along with other terrorist commanders. According to the report, Karaki was killed when six missiles struck the building he was occupying. Karaki was also a member of Hezbollah’s top 'military' organization, the Jihad Council, which is subordinate to the Shura Council and under the direct control of Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. Monday night’s strike was the fourth time that IAF jets struck the Lebanese capital since the conflict with Hezbollah began immediately after October 7th, when the Lebanese terror group expressed solidarity with Hamas by attacking Israel. On Friday, the IDF eliminated 16 top Hezbollah Radwan force commanders, including the leader Ibrahim Aqil. Israel’s military operation targeted the Radwan Force commanders meeting in the basement of a building in the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut. Aqil was the top commander of the Radwan force and was planning an invasion of Galilee. Ahmed Wahbi, head of the Radwan training unit, was also eliminated. Wahbi was also heavily involved in planning the Galilee invasion and, according to the IDF, was 'advancing Hezbollah’s entrenchment in southern Lebanon while attempting to improve the organization’s ground combat capabilities.' Concerning the operation, the IDF said, 'These Radwan terror commanders were plotting an attack and invasion into Israel’s territory for years and were ready to carry out the plans at a moment’s notice when given the order.' 'Aqil and the other commanders eliminated in the strike were responsible for planning and executing hundreds of terror attacks against Israelis, including the planned invasion of the Galilee,' the IDF announced. Hezbollah, which doesn’t always acknowledge the elimination of their leaders, confirmed that Aqil and others had been killed and said his body had been recovered from under the rubble.

Hezbollah rocket directly hits home in lower Galilee, no injuries	These rooms save lives. Thirty centimeters saved three lives today—it’s surreal.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, one of the many missiles Hezbollah fired into Israel directly hit a home in Givat Avni with the residents hiding in a shelter close by. There were no reported injuries among the residents of the house. David Yitzhak, who lived in the home, described to Ynet how the missile hit the house just moments after the family fled to the safe room. 'We gathered in the safe room, and after I locked the door, there was this crazy explosion.' 'I immediately knew the missile hit the house. It was obvious.' Yitzhak expressed relief at the narrow escape from the missile and emphasized the importance of safe rooms. 'These rooms save lives. Thirty centimeters saved three lives today—it’s surreal,' he said. He also urged citizens to obey safety instructions during this conflict. 'It's important for everyone to follow instructions. You need to run when told to; that’s the message everyone needs to hear,' Yitzhak said. On Monday, Hezbollah fired 180 rockets into Israel, and bomb disposal experts were deployed in Lower Galilee and other areas. Magen Dovid Adom (MDA) reported several injuries from Hezbollah's missile attack, including a 59-year-old man who was wounded by shrapnel near the Golani Junction, a 25-year-old who sustained injuries while fleeing to a shelter, and several people who were treated for shock. In the afternoon, 10 rockets targeted Lower Galilee, and 25 reached the area of Safed and the Sea of Galilee. Most of these missiles were intercepted, but others landed in open fields near Ammiad and Nahal Amud. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant assessed the security situation and gave a message to the Israeli public. 'The resilience of the civilian front is key to enabling the IDF to fight and strike the enemy,' Gallant said. 'In the coming days, the public will need to show composure, discipline and full compliance with Home Front Command guidelines. This saves lives.'

Israel’s high-tech sector defies war with $9 billion in investmen...	The high-tech industry makes up over 50% of Israel’s exports, accounts for one-fifth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and generates one-quarter of all state revenues from employment taxes. By Pesach Benson, TPS Despite a year of war, Israel’s high-tech industry has been surprisingly stable, according to a report released by the Israel Innovation Authority on Monday. Total investments in technology companies have remained robust, with nearly $9 billion raised from the onset of the war until mid-August 2024. This figure positions Israel as the third-largest recipient of global tech investments during this period, trailing only Silicon Valley and New York City, while surpassing other major cities such as London and Paris. The high-tech industry makes up over 50% of Israel’s exports, accounts for one-fifth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and generates one-quarter of all state revenues from employment taxes. However, the report found that following a decade of exponential growth, key performance indicators in high-tech have stagnated for over two years. The total number of high-tech employees has plateaued at approximately 400,000, maintaining a steady share of about 11% of the overall workforce. 'Since the high-tech workers contribute a significant portion of the income tax, this stagnation may affect the state’s revenues in the coming years at a time when it is facing a deepening deficit and is required for growth-encouraging measures,' the report said. In stark contrast, global employment trends present a different picture, the report added. In 2023, high-tech employment in Europe grew by about 5%, while the U.S. saw an increase of approximately 2.8%. Israel, however, managed a modest growth rate of 2.6%, closely aligning with its population growth. A deeper dive into employment statistics reveals a bifurcation in job creation: while research and development (R&D) positions have seen a steady increase, roles in product and business operations have faced declines. Looking ahead, the mood within the high-tech services sector appears to be improving. As of July 2024, nearly 23% of companies expressed optimism about hiring more workers in the coming year — a notable increase from just 10% last year. This shift signals a growing confidence among firms that the worst may be behind them, suggesting that the appetite for growth is beginning to return, the report said. A continued influx of foreign investment into Israel’s high-tech sector reinforces this notion. The stability of venture capital funds remains intact, with no significant drop in the number of active funds, particularly foreign ones, which constitute about two-thirds of all venture capital in Israel.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guards ban communications devices after stri...	IRGC officials have reached out to Hezbollah for technical assessments, and several examples of exploded devices have been sent to Tehran for examination by Iranian experts. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), an internationally designated terrorist organization, has ordered all members to stop using any type of communication devices after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon blew up in deadly attacks last week, two senior Iranian security officials told Reuters. One of the security officials said a large-scale operation is underway by the IRGC to inspect all devices, not just communication equipment. He said most of these devices were either homemade or imported from China and Russia. Iran was concerned about infiltration by Israeli agents, including Iranians on Israel’s payroll and a thorough investigation of personnel has already begun, targeting mid and high-ranking members of the IRGC, added the official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. 'This includes scrutiny of their bank accounts both in Iran and abroad, as well as their travel history and that of their families,' the security official said. Iran’s Foreign, Defense, and Interior Ministries were not immediately available to respond to the comments made by the security officials to Reuters. In a coordinated attack, the pager devices detonated on Tuesday across Hezbollah‘s strongholds. On Wednesday, hundreds of Hezbollah walkie-talkies exploded. The attacks killed 39 people and injured more than 3,000 people. Lebanon and Hezbollah say Israel was behind the attacks. Israel has neither denied nor confirmed involvement. The security official declined to give details on how the IRGC force, comprising 190,000 personnel, are communicating. 'For now, we are using end-to-end encryption in messaging systems,' he said. According to the same official, there is widespread concern among Iran’s ruling establishment. IRGC officials have reached out to Hezbollah for technical assessments, and several examples of exploded devices have been sent to Tehran for examination by Iranian experts. MISSILE, NUCLEAR FACILITIES Another Iranian official said the Islamic Republic’s main concern was the protection of the country’s nuclear and missile facilities, particularly those underground. 'But since last year, security measures at those sites have increased significantly,' he said in reference to stepped up measures after what Iranian authorities said was Israel’s attempt to sabotage Iran’s missile program in 2023. Israel has never commented on this. 'There has never, ever been such tight security and extreme measures in place as there are now,' he added, suggesting that security has been significantly increased beyond previous levels after the pager explosions in Lebanon. The IRGC is a powerful political, military, and economic force in Iran with close ties to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Set up after the 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the clerical ruling system, it has its own ground force, navy, and air force that oversee Iran’s strategic weapons. It exerts influence in the Middle East through its overseas operations arm, the Al Quds Force, by providing money, weapons, technology, and training to allied terrorist groups: Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, Yemen’s Houthis, and militias in Iraq. Iran’s military uses a range of encrypted communication devices, including walkie-talkies, for secure communication, said the first Iranian source. While specific models and brands might vary, Iranian military communications equipment was often developed domestically or sourced from a combination of local and foreign suppliers, he said. He said Iran’s armed forces have stopped using pagers for over two decades. Tehran has developed its own military-grade radio transmissions through its defense industry to avoid reliance on foreign imports, especially due to Western sanctions imposed on Tehran over its nuclear program, he added. However, in the past, Iran has imported communication devices from countries such as China and Russia and even Japan. Iran and Israel have been locked in a shadow war for decades, with mutual allegations of sabotage and assassination plots. The conflict, including between Israel and Hezbollah, has intensified in the past year in parallel with the Gaza war, which erupted after the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7. Iran and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for assassinating Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah‘s most senior military commander, Fuad Shukr, in Beirut a few hours earlier in July. Israel said it killed Shukr but it has not confirmed it was behind Haniyeh’s death. Iran does not recognize Israel’s right to exist. Khamenei has previously called Israel a 'cancerous tumor' that 'will undoubtedly be uprooted and destroyed.' Israel believes that Iran poses an existential threat. It also accuses Iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons, though Iran denies seeking to build a nuclear bomb.

Hezbollah rockets reach northern cities, Samaria	By early Monday evening, Hezbollah had fired 180 total rockets into Israel, reaching Samaria for the first time since October 7. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, Hezbollah fired a barrage of over 180 long-range missiles into Israel, setting off sirens in towns close to Haifa, Tiberias and the Galilee and reaching Samaria for the first time since the beginning of the war. In the afternoon, sirens sounded in the Haifa and Mount Carmel area and there were alerts in Nesher, as well as in Isfiya, Kiryat Atta, Daliyat al-Karmel, and Shefa-Amr. According to the IDF, 25 rockets reached the Golan Heights and 15 targeted the Haifa Bay area. An additional 10 missiles reached Samaria setting off alarms in Ariel and in the settlements of Yakir, Nofim, Kiryat Netafim, Revava, the Ariel Industrial Zone, Barkan, Havot Yair, the Barkan Industrial Zone and Ofarim. Hezbollah fired an additional barrage of 15 rockets at the Jezreel Valley and Haifa Bay area early in the evening. As of 7:00 pm on Monday, Hezbollah had fired 180 total rockets into Israel, reaching a number of areas for the first time. In retaliation, Israel carried out a targeted strike in Beirut for the fourth time since the beginning of the conflict with Lebanon. Channel 12 quotes a senior Israeli official who declares, 'What Hezbollah hasn’t understood through force, it will understand through more force.' The IDF has ordered Lebanese civilians to evacuated sensitive areas ahead of a military strike. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared in a video message to Lebanese civilians urging them to follow evacuation orders. Israel’s war is not with you,' he says in a video statement. 'It’s with Hezbollah.' 'For too long, Hezbollah has been using you as human shields,' says Netanyahu. 'It placed rockets in your living rooms and missiles in your garage. Those rockets and missiles are aimed directly at our cities, directly at our citizens,' he added To defend our people against Hezbollah strikes, we must take out these weapons,' he says. 'Starting this morning, the IDF has warned you to get out of harm’s way,' Netanyahu explained. 'I urge you – take this warning seriously. Don’t let Hezbollah endanger your lives and the lives of your loved ones. Don’t let Hezbollah endanger Lebanon.'

Jerusalem has ramped up its rhetoric and escalated attacks on Hezbollah since recently adding the return of residents to the north as an official war goal. More than 60,000 Israelis remain internally displaced after nearly a year of near-daily rocket, missile and drone attacks by Hezbollah in support of Hamas in Gaza. Hezbollah-affiliated media in Lebanon reported on injuries from the widespread Israeli attacks, which reached deep into Lebanese territory in the Bekaa Valley. Meanwhile, rocket alarms were heard in the Safed area of Israel’s Upper Galilee, with many explosions heard and dozens of interceptions reported. A major barrage was also reported deep into the Lower Galilee. The Magen David Adom medical emergency response group said two Israelis sustained light wounds when a rocket hit in the area of the Golani intersection, located in the Lower Galilee between Tiberias and Nazareth. The men, 25 and 59, were evacuated to Poria Medical Center (Baruch Padeh Medical Center) near Tiberias for treatment. In Giv’at Avni, located adjacent to the Sea of Galilee, a fire broke out after a Hezbollah rocket scored a direct hit on a house, local media reported. The residents had barricaded themselves in their bomb shelter and emerged unharmed following the attacks, according to the reports. Israel’s opposition leader Yair Lapid welcomed the IAF strikes in Lebanon in a statement. 'Supporting the Air Force, the IDF, and the security forces in their operation in Lebanon. The time has come.

More than 60,000 Israelis remain internally displaced after nearly a year of near-daily rocket, missile and drone attacks by Hezbollah in support of Hamas in Gaza. Hezbollah-affiliated media in Lebanon reported on injuries from the widespread Israeli attacks, which reached deep into Lebanese territory in the Bekaa Valley. Meanwhile, rocket alarms were heard in the Safed area of Israel’s Upper Galilee, with many explosions heard and dozens of interceptions reported. A major barrage was also reported deep into the Lower Galilee. The Magen David Adom medical emergency response group said two Israelis sustained light wounds when a rocket hit in the area of the Golani intersection, located in the Lower Galilee between Tiberias and Nazareth. The men, 25 and 59, were evacuated to Poria Medical Center (Baruch Padeh Medical Center) near Tiberias for treatment. In Giv’at Avni, located adjacent to the Sea of Galilee, a fire broke out after a Hezbollah rocket scored a direct hit on a house, local media reported. The residents had barricaded themselves in their bomb shelter and emerged unharmed following the attacks, according to the reports. Israel’s opposition leader Yair Lapid welcomed the IAF strikes in Lebanon in a statement. 'Supporting the Air Force, the IDF, and the security forces in their operation in Lebanon. The time has come. Be strong and courageous, and act—do not fear or be dismayed until all the residents of the north return to their homes safely,' the Yesh Atid Party leader tweeted.

Israel rebuffs Irish president’s accusation Israel stole letter t...	Irish president accuses Israeli embassy of intercepting his letter to his Iranian counterpart and circulating to the media, sparking latest diplomatic row between Jerusalem and Dublin. By World Israel News Staff Ireland's president has accused the Israeli embassy in Dublin of intercepting a congratulatory letter he penned to his newly-elected Iranian counterpart, using the document to embarrass him. Irish President Michael Higgins penned several months ago what he dubbed a 'courtesy letter' to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, congratulating him on his July electoral victory. Last month, the letter began circulating online, revealing the details of Higgins' missive to Pezeshkian. During a speech this week at the United Nations Future Summit, Higgins blasted the Israeli Embassy in Ireland, accusing the Israeli mission to Dublin of intercepting the letter and circulating it publicly to embarrass Higgins. Higgins noted that at the time of the letter's first appearance online, it was criticized by the Israeli embassy, which said that it sent 'the wrong message to the Iranian people who live in fear under this brutal regime,' though he acknowledged that he did not know how the Israeli mission might have obtained the letter. The Irish president also pointed to the absence of Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich from the country as being suggestive of Israel's role, saying it prevented his government from summoning her in response to Israel's alleged role in the leak. On Monday, however, the Israeli Embassy in Ireland pushed back on Higgins' claims, calling them 'baseless' and 'highly inflammatory.' 'Unfortunately, in Ireland, since the October 7 invasion by Hamas and massacre in Israel, which triggered this awful war, Israel has been subjected to a high level of malicious statements and accusations that have often manifested as incitement to hatred.' 'This baseless accusation is highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous and the embassy rejects it completely.'

Only 30-35 hostages still alive, says captive’s mother	Einav Zangauker rejects the prime minister's claim that some 50 hostages are still among the living. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A mother of one of the 97 hostages still being held by Hamas rejected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that about 50 of the captives are still alive, in an interview on Army Radio Monday. 'The prime minister is lying,' Einav Zangauker said. 'We know, the families, that the number is far smaller than the number cited by the prime minister.' The relatives of the hostages receive intelligence updates from the army whenever they have new information on their loved ones' status, she told the station, and therefore, 'in my opinion, there are no more than 30 to 35 hostage still alive.' In his report to the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Sunday, Netanyahu had also cited intelligence as his source, saying, 'According to the information we have, half of the hostages in Gaza are alive.' Zangauker also expressed pessimism about any forthcoming deal. 'There are no [significant] contacts between the Israeli team and the mediators,' she said, and 'Hamas is not involved.' The Americans, being busy with the upcoming elections, ahve basically 'given up' their efforts for the time being as well, she added. Zangauker has repeatedly blamed the prime minister over the last several months for not consummating a ceasefire-for-hostages agreement, even though the Americans have backed Netanyahu's claim that it is Hamas that has walked away from any deal. In a Sunday statement, she accused Netanyahu and his government of 'deliberately stalling the deal,' because the Israeli leader prefers 'regional escalation' over the lives of the hostages. She went as far as charging him with helping Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and wanting war so as to preserve his rule, 'sacrific[ing] the abductees on that 'altar.' 'Just as Netanyahu nurtured Hamas for years, so is Netanyahu now cooperating with Sinwar, and giving him what he wants: a multi-regional war. The hostages and all citizens of Israel are paying and will pay the price,' she added. Zangauker has publicly stated that if her son is murdered in Gaza, 'I won't blame Hamas, just the prime minister.' Her son, Matan, was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7 along with his partner, Ilana Gritzewsky, and 249 other Israelis and foreign nationals during Hamas' surprise invasion in which they and other terrorists also brutally massacred 1,200 people. Gritzewsky was released in the only hostage deal to date, in late November, along with 85 other Israeli women and children, in exchange for a week-long ceasefire, the release of Palestinian female and underage security prisoners from Israeli jails, and a huge increase in humanitarian aid.

IDF warns of new strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley	Israel gives Lebanese civilians two hours to evacuate areas used by Hezbollah to store weapons, after IDF strikes over 300 targets in southern Lebanon. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Israeli military announced Monday afternoon it plans to carry out an extensive aerial campaign against Hezbollah positions in eastern Lebanon, warning residents in targeted areas to evacuate. Senior IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that the Israeli Air Force was poised to expand its air campaign against Hezbollah missile depots to the Beqaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, after striking hundreds of positions in southern Lebanon, near the Israeli border. The IDF has given residents of the effected areas two hours to evacuate before the airstrikes begin. Hagari said that residents of the Beqaa Valley living in or near homes used to store Hezbollah rockets must evacuate. 'This warning is focused on the villages in the Beqaa valley,' Hagari said. 'I urge the Lebanese residents of the villages in the Beqaa Valley who are inside or near houses where rockets and weapons are stored, to move away immediately! For your safety and protection.' 'You can see the operations we are currently conducting in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah intends to launch these weapons toward Israel, and we will not allow it! Stay away for your own protection. Hassan Nasrallah is lying to you and putting you in danger,' Hagari continued, referencing the leader of the Hezbollah organization. Earlier on Monday, Hagari revealed evidence collected by the IDF, showing Hezbollah's use of private homes to store rockets and missiles, with some buildings modified to allow for missiles to be launched. During Monday morning and afternoon, Israeli warplanes bombed over 300 Hezbollah rocket and missile storage sites across southern Lebanon. According to Lebanon’s health ministry, at least 100 people were killed and 500 more injured in the strikes. Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, adjacent to the Syrian border, is considered a Hezbollah stronghold and serves as an important transportation hub for personnel and arms from Syria to the Lebanese terror group.

Hezbollah storing missiles in private homes, says IDF	Iranian-backed terrorists storing missiles inside civilian homes, IDF reveals, pointing to evidence Hezbollah even using homes as makeshift launch sites. By World Israel News Staff The Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah has been using civilian homes in Lebanon to store missiles and even as launching sites, a senior Israeli military spokesman said Monday. During a press briefing Monday morning, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari provided evidence collected by the IDF, revealing how Hezbollah terrorists use residential buildings to conceal rockets and missiles. In some instances, Hagari said, the homes are even transformed into makeshift launch sites. 'Here we are exposing Hezbollah’s method of hiding a cruise missile inside a home,' Hagari said. 'The terrorists create a designated opening for the missile launch. Here you can see how we identified the terrorists making an opening in the building that exposed the missile.' Hagari alluded to IDF airstrikes on hundreds of positions in Lebanon Monday, saying the attacks would target missile depots hidden in villages, just as a recent airstrike had done. 'In a precise strike, the IDF eliminated the terrorists and this missile launching infrastructure, shortly before the launch. Shortly, the IDF will engage in extensive, precise strikes, against terror targets which have been embedded widely throughout Lebanon.' On Monday, the IDF issued a warning in Arabic to residents of the targeted villages, urging them to immediately evacuate. Afterwards, the Israel Air Force carried out over 300 airstrikes Monday on Hezbollah missile storage depots across Lebanon. Lebanon's health ministry claimed at least 100 people were killed an hundreds more injured in the strikes. Israeli president Isaac Herzog took to X to defend the strikes, saying Israel could not tolerate Hezbollah's massive build up of missiles and rockets near the Israeli border. 'I repeat and reiterate: Israel does not seek war,' Herzog tweeted. 'But we have the right and the duty to defend our people.' 'Here’s just an example of the threat we face. This IDF video shows how Hezbollah stores and launches missiles in civilian areas and homes.' 'Thousands and thousands of long range rockets are kept in houses, living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens, and then launched with the sole intention of killing our people.' 'Would you accept this in your or your neighbor’s home? What nation would accept its citizens living under such a threat from its neighbors?'

Biden ‘pushing hard’ to prevent war between Israel and Hezbollah	President Biden says his administration is doing 'everything we can' to prevent full-scale war on Israel - Lebanon frontier from breaking out, as tensions rise between Israel and Hezbollah. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden said Sunday his administration is making every effort to prevent the escalation of tensions between Israel and the Hezbollah terrorist group into a full-scale war, following a massive wave of Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel and IDF reprisals on Hezbollah positions. Speaking with reporters on the White House South Lawn Sunday, Biden said that following last week's targeted bombings of Hezbollah members and the barrages of rocket fire by the Iranian-backed group over the weekend, the U.S. is 'pushing hard' to prevent the outbreak of a broader war. 'We’re going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out. And we’re still pushing hard,' Biden said. On Sunday, U.S. officials expressed concern to Axios' Barak Ravid regarding Israel's attempt at 'de-escalation through escalation' with Hezbollah, saying it would require 'extremely difficult calibration' that could end up sparking an all-out war. Last Tuesday and Wednesday, thousands of pagers and hand-held radios issued by Hezbollah to its operatives detonated simultaneously, killing dozens and injuring thousands. While Israel has yet to confirm its role in the attacks, the bombings are thought to have been carried out by the Mossad. On Friday, IDF warplanes bombed a Hezbollah position in Beirut, killing 16 members of the terror group's elite Radwan Force, including two of its commanders, Ibrahim Aqil and Ahmed Wehbe. Over the weekend Israeli officials, including President Isaac Herzog, said the strike was carried out after intelligence was obtained pointing to an impending October-7th style invasion of northern Israel by the Radwan Force. Tensions continued to mount Saturday, with Hezbollah unleashing a massive barrage of hundreds of rockets and missiles, with attacks beginning Saturday night and running through Sunday morning. The IDF responded to the attacks, with artillery fire and targeted airstrikes. On Monday, Israeli forces bombed multiple Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, after warning locals to seek shelter.

Trump meets Qatari leaders in Florida	As president, Trump had at times both criticized Qatar for supporting terrorism and praised it for taking 'action to counter terrorism and extremism in all forms.' By JNS Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump met on Sunday with Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani at the former president’s Florida resort. He also met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. 'The Amir has proven to be a great and powerful leader of his country, advancing on all levels at record speed,' Trump posted to his social media platform Truth Social. 'He is someone also who strongly wants peace in the Middle East, and all over the world. We had a great relationship during my years in the White House, and it will be even stronger this time around!' As president, Trump had at times both criticized Qatar for supporting terrorism and praised it for taking 'action to counter terrorism and extremism in all forms.' The Biden administration has looked to Qatar as a mediator in ceasefire-for-hostages talks between Israel and Hamas. However, the Qatari government hosts Hamas leaders and has been implicated in illicit funding of U.S. universities. In July 2019, the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) revealed that 'foreign donations from Qatar, especially, have had a substantial impact on fomenting growing levels of antisemitic discourse and campus politics at U.S. universities.' Qatar also funds the Al Jazeera Media Network, which is based in its capital of Doha. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the network a 'mouthpiece for Hamas.' On Sunday, Israel’s military raided the network’s office in Ramallah and ordered its closure for 45 days. Earlier this month, Israel revoked the press passes of Al Jazeera reporters working in the Jewish state. The move was in keeping with a law passed by the Knesset in April that gave the Communications Minister the ability to act against a foreign channel that harms the state’s security, with the consent of the prime minister and approval of the Cabinet. The measures enable authorities to order television providers to stop broadcasting the outlet; close its offices in Israel; seize its equipment; shut down its website; and revoke press credentials for staff.

70 dead as Israel’s West Nile virus cases soar	While the outbreak’s epicenter remains in central Israel, health officials have noted an increase of cases in Haifa and Be’er Sheva. By Jewish Breaking News What began as a minor occurrence of West Nile virus in Israel last month has quickly escalated into a widespread outbreak. According to Israel’s Health Ministry, 913 patients have now been diagnosed with West Nile virus compared to 8 cases in early June. The outbreak has taken a grim toll, with 70 fatalities reported so far. The mosquito-borne illness has been a growing concern for Israelis. While most carriers of the virus never develop symptoms, approximately 20% of those infected experiences varying degrees of illness. Symptoms can range from fever and general fatigue to head and body aches. In severe cases, the virumosquitos can cause life-threatening neurological illnesses such as encephalitis or meningitis. Israeli health officials have been quick to emphasize that severe neurological complications are rare, occurring in less than 1% of infected individuals. However, this has done little to quell public concern as the number of cases continues to climb rapidly. While the outbreak’s epicenter remains in central Israel, health officials have noted an increase of cases in Haifa and Be’er Sheva. Israel’s Ministry of Environmental Protection is calling on both the government and the public to prevent a full-blown epidemic. In concentrated areas like Tel Aviv, citizens are being urged to use insect repellent, wear long-sleeved clothing, and avoid standing water where mosquitoes can breed.

Israel mulling reconquering northern Gaza	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the government may adopt the 'Generals’ Plan' that outlines how to defeat Hamas. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee (FADC) Sunday that he is seriously considering a proposal to take over all of northern Gaza to pressure Hamas to restart negotiations for a hostages-for-ceasefire deal. The 'Generals’ Plan' was presented to the government by the Commanders and Reserve Soldiers Forum early this month as a way to defeat Hamas altogether. Besides turning the stretch from Gaza City north into a closed military zone after allowing all residents to leave via secured humanitarian corridors, it also envisions the IDF taking charge of all humanitarian aid deliveries. No aid would be allowed into the besieged zone, forcing any Hamas forces left there after the evacuation of civilians to either surrender, starve or come out to fight the overwhelming IDF force that would greet them. Israeli control over the aid would take away a huge source of revenue for Hamas, which has reportedly made hundreds of millions of dollars by stealing and selling the internationally-donated supplies. It can thus provide for and pay its men as well, and tempt others to join its forces, needing the manpower desperately after 11 months of battle has left it denuded of most of its military might. Perhaps more importantly, being the source of food and medicine is the way the terrorists group controls the population. Losing permanent control over the aid and at least temporary control over the land is the only pressure tactic that will work to bring Hamas to its knees, according to Maj. Gen. (res.) Giora Eiland, one of the key authors of the Forum’s plan. The Generals’ Plan 'makes a lot of sense,' Kan News reported Netanyahu as telling the FADC members, although he said there are 'several' other plans being considered as well. 'We are committed to dismantling the civilian control of Hamas,' he said. Still, he added, he was against annexing civilian areas wholesale. He also said that he did not feel that Israeli military rule over Gaza was the preferred solution, although maintaining an IDF presence inside Gaza at least along the border was a must. Handing the reins to the Palestinian Authority, run by the nationalist Fatah group, Hamas’ arch enemy, was no solution either, he contended, as the PA is just as anti-Israel as its foes. On the other hand, attempts to encourage Gazan clans to assert control at least over their own localities had proven fruitless, he noted. A few attempts made months ago by certain powerful families in the Strip had ended quickly after Hamas killed several members of the clans. The Prime Minister’s Office said Sunday that the army has been asked to present the government with a plan of how it would take charge of aid distribution in the Gaza Strip.

Israel strikes central Gaza school taken over by Hamas	The IDF added that it stepped up aerial surveillance and used precision munitions to mitigate danger to civilians. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli aircraft struck a Hamas command and control center in a building formerly used as a school in central Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces said on Monday. According to the IDF, the building, which served as the Khaled ibn al-Walid School, was being used by terror groups to plan and carry out attacks. 'This is a further example of the Hamas terrorist organization’s systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law,' the army said. The IDF added that it stepped up aerial surveillance and used precision munitions to mitigate danger to civilians. The announcement comes two days after Israel released footage of Hamas terrorists robbing humanitarian aid from a truck in the southern Gaza area of Rafah. Soldiers who were securing the humanitarian corridor directed drones to kill the terrorists as they fled the scene in vehicles. The Press Service of Israel recently reported that Hamas is continuing to pay salaries to its gunmen and civil servants partly through taxing and diverting humanitarian aid and distributing food vouchers — with the help of clans, criminal groups and so-called 'People’s Committees.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

If you are in a building containing Hezbollah weapons, move away immediately until further notice,' read a text message sent to residents of Lebanon's south. By World Israel News Staff The IDF's spokesman released an unusual warning to Lebanese civilians in the south of the country on Monday morning, calling on those unaffiliated with the Hezbollah terror group to flee the region. In a video posted on social media, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari announced that Israel would carry out targeted strikes on Hezbollah military assets located within civilian communities in southern Lebanon. 'Hezbollah is endangering you and your families. Hezbollah is planning to launch weapons against Israel, and you should distance yourselves immediately for your safety,' Hagari said. The video included an illustration depicting how Hezbollah terrorists had modified a home to become a launch site for a cruise missile, further blurring the lines between civilian and terror targets. Additionally, the Israeli military sent Arabic-language text messages to residents of southern Lebanon. 'If you are in a building containing Hezbollah weapons, move away immediately until further notice,' the text message read. In response to the IDF announcement, the Hezbollah terror group released its own Hebrew-language message to Israeli civilians. The text appeared to have been written using an automatic translation, and was riddled with spelling and grammatical errors. 'Urgent warning to settlers living in the Palestinian territories,' read the message. 'If you are present in, or live near, a military base, your army is storing weapons and military capabilities there. Anyone who is a member of or physically close to the Israeli terrorist army exposes himself to danger.' IDF Chief of Staff Herzi HaLevi said in a separate statement that Israel would continue intensifying its military campaign against the terror group. 'The price that Hezbollah is paying has increased, our attacks will increase,' he said. 'We will safely return the residents to their homes, and if Hezbollah has not understood this yet, it will get another blow and another blow — until the organization understands.'

‘This will not break our spirit’: Northern Israeli communities pu...	Among the homes hit was that of a Kiryat Shmona evacuee, Itai Abekasis, who relocated to his parents’ house in Moreshet. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Despite the damage caused by Sunday morning’s Hezbollah rocket barrage, Israeli residents of Kiryat Bialik and Moreshet said they refused to be broken by the attacks. 'Despite the situation, people were incredibly composed,' Moreshet resident Ephraim Winkler told The Press Service of Israel. Winkler also heads the Karmiel-Misgav branch of United Hatzalah, a volunteer-based emergency medical response service. 'I was on my way driving to work when the rockets hit. I stopped on the road and looked back to see smoke coming up from the direction of Moreshet, so I went back calling up my team to join me. We quickly split forces to respond—some went to the lower street, and I headed to the upper street where homes were hit,' he said. His team evacuated families, including an elderly widower and a couple whose house was directly impacted. 'There was a huge fire—three cars and two houses caught fire. We worked to contain it to prevent further damage,' Winkler recalled to TPS-IL. Winkler, who also serves as part of the Hatzalah’s mental health resilience team, stressed how calm the residents remained. 'Neighbors quickly opened their bomb shelters and made sure everyone was safe. You could see their strength; there were no signs of panic, just solidarity and cooperation. Imagine that this happened early in the morning, most people woke up to the chaos,' he said. Among the homes hit was that of a Kiryat Shmona evacuee, Itai Abekasis, who relocated to his parents’ house in Moreshet. Itai, who is on reserve duty at the northern border, was home for Shabbat. 'My family was miraculously saved by following safety protocols. They rushed to the shelter just seconds before the rocket hit, shattering windows and causing extensive damage to the house,' Abecassis told TPS-IL. A video clip Abekasis shared on social media showed a room in disarray, a baby crib near a bed, with shattered windows, pieces of glass covering the floor. 'Look at that, that’s where we were sleeping. Look at all the glass!' he said in the clip. Together with other northern communities’ evacuees, who spent the year away from their own homes, he stresses again the necessity of winning this war against Hezbollah. 'The government of Israel and the [army] must continue to ensure the security of all residents of the north and do everything necessary to dismantle Hezbollah’s capabilities,' the 'Fighting for the North' headquarters said to TPS-IL. In Kiryat Bialik, the morning has also started with violent noise of explosions, with interceptors taking down incoming rockets, but falling debris still caused damage to several homes. Mayor Eli Dukorsky told TPS-IL, 'We woke up to a difficult morning in Kiryat Bialik. The interceptors did their job, but shrapnel from the missiles damaged residential buildings. Fortunately, only three people sustained minor injuries. Our municipal and security forces handled the situation effectively, restoring calm to the city.' Dukorsky shared an image of one of the damaged homes draped in Israeli flags, posting on social media. 'They will not break our spirit. The house has been covered with the flags of Israel and our city,' Dukorsky wrote on social media. Hundreds of residents responded with comments of resilience and pride. This spirit of determination was echoed by the Moreshet community, where volunteers and emergency teams worked hand in hand in the attack’s aftermath. 'Everyone here is strong,' Winkler insisted. 'We’ve had to deal with tragedy before. Three of the sons of our community have fallen in the war, one of them just last week, very recently. But it doesn’t break us, we stay prepared and we stay united.' Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have soared in recent days. On Monday, the Security Cabinet updated its official war goals to include the secure return of 60,000 evacuated northern residents to their homes. On Tuesday, pagers belonging to Hezbollah operatives exploded across Lebanon and in Syria, injuring thousands. More Hezbollah figures were injured in a second wave of explosions on Wednesday. The Iran-backed terror group said 32 of its people were killed, a number that has not been independently verified. Israeli officials believe the death toll is higher than Hezbollah has indicated. The blasts are widely attributed to Israel, but Jerusalem has not commented. On Thursday, two Israeli soldiers were killed along the northern border in Hezbollah missile and drone attacks. An Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Friday killed 16 senior terrorists, eliminating most of the elite Radwan Force’s chain of command. Northern residents were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. The terror group has launched more than 6,700 rockets and drones, killing 26 civilians and 22 soldiers on the Israeli side. Hezbollah leaders have said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes, which Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah reiterated in a speech on Thursday night. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War.

Herzog unveils Oct. 7 war memorial in Jerusalem	In the inner section, a mini auditorium with unique lighting was created for families to privately reflect with their loved ones. By JNS Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion on Sunday unveiled the Swords of Iron memorial monument on the capital’s Ruppin Street, opposite the National Library. The monument is the first of its kind in the city to commemorate both the victims of Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre and Israel Defense Forces soldiers who fell in the ensuing war. 'These are difficult, painful and bloody days, in which our enemies are doing everything they can to prevent Israeli citizens from living normal lives, to harm the citizens of Israel and the State of Israel,' said Herzog at the start of the event. 'We have never sought war, and we do not want war, but let it be clear: We will not rest and we will not stop until all Israeli citizens return to their homes and are safe and secure. It is Israel’s right, and duty, to defend its citizens. Israel’s defensive and offensive capabilities are proving themselves, and we will continue until full security is achieved,' he added. The ceremony was attended by senior government officials, Jerusalem City Council members, dozens of ambassadors and bereaved families. The inauguration ceremony for the new monument in memory of Jerusalem residents who were murdered in October 7 massacre and in recent war, in Jerusalem, September 22, 2024. (By Oren Ben Hakoon/Flash90) 'This monument highlights the magnitude of the loss Jerusalem has experienced, while also conveying hope for better days, days that we all pray for and long to see. This shared commemoration sends a message of hope and unity, which are so vital for all of us,' said Lion. 'Anyone who gazes upon this monument realizes the unbearable price that Jerusalem and the State of Israel have paid since Oct. 7—the profound pain entailed in this cost. This memorial honors the words, the tears, the stories and the pain of the families,' he continued. A chapter of Psalms was recited by Rabbi Shmuel Slotki, who lost both his sons, Noam and Yishai, to the war against Hamas. The prayer for the return of the hostages was delivered by Jon Polin, father of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of six captives recently executed by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza. The memorial is made of iron, with a diameter of 14 meters and a height of approximately 5.5 meters. The names of the fallen are engraved on the monument—the soldiers, security forces, rescue personnel and civilians from Jerusalem who lost their lives since Oct. 7. Inside the core of the structure, a verse from the 'Nachem' prayer, which is recited once a year on Tisha B’Av, is engraved: 'Therefore Zion will weep bitterly, and Jerusalem will give forth its voice. My heart, my heart grieves for their fallen; my bowels, my bowels grieve for their fallen.' In the inner section, a mini auditorium with unique lighting was created for families to privately reflect with their loved ones. document.createElement('video'); The post Herzog unveils Oct. 7 war memorial in Jerusalem appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/herzog-unveils-oct-7-war-memorial-in-jerusalem/	2024-09-23T01:44:42-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/F240922OBH12-scaled.jpg
Hostage families: ‘Protests are killing our loved ones’	Israelis are 'following Sinwar's instructions' by protesting, fumes brother of kidnapped man. By World Israel News Staff Families of civilians and soldiers held captive by Hamas terrorists for almost one year are slamming the ongoing hostage release protests, which have joined forces with the anti-government Kaplan Movement, stating that the demonstrations are actually decreasing the chances that their loved ones will be freed. The Forum for Hostage Families has claimed to be a non-partisan organization advocating on behalf of all those whose loved ones were kidnapped, but some families have said that the group promotes a political agenda. Those who are in favor of military pressure as the most effective tactic for freeing the hostages established the Tikva Forum. Its members do not support the weekly Tel Aviv rallies calling for a ceasefire, where speakers often include anti-Netanyahu rhetoric in their speeches. Nadav Miran, whose brother Omri was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7th, said that many of the hostage families had unwittingly become pawns of Hamas due to their vocal criticism of the Israeli government and participation in protests calling for a hostage deal at any cost. 'The content of the [hostage deal rallies] is now focused on toppling the government,' Miran, a member of the Tikva Forum, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'We hear [Hamas leader] Yahya Sinwar forcing the hostages to demand street protests calling for their release' in psychological warfare videos, Miran said. 'And what do Israeli citizens do? They follow Sinwar's instructions' by protesting, he added. Miran stressed that growing public pressure for a deal only makes Hamas sharpen its demands, putting the terror group in a stronger position at the negotiating table. 'Those who go to the protests are preventing a deal and killing the captives,' he said. 'Because of the demonstrations, the price [Hamas is demanding] for the hostages is increasing.' He added that it bothers him to see photos of his brother being held by the protesters. 'My brother is being used to protect their agenda. They are standing against the truth. The only one blocking a deal is Hamas, and even the Americans are saying that.' Miran's views were backed by Shimon Or, whose nephew, Avinatan, was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival alongside his girlfriend, Noa Argamani. Demonstrators using Avinatan's photo at protests 'don't actually care about him or the other captives,' Or told Ynet. 'They have their own goals - primarily overthrowing the prime minister.'

Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar may have been killed – report	IDF intelligence reportedly probing possibility that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief and mastermind of the October 7th invasion, may be dead. By World Israel News Staff Israel's military is currently investigating whether Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar has died, according to multiple reports carried by Hebrew media outlets late Sunday night and early Monday morning. Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7th invasion of Israel and massacre of some 1,200 people in southwestern Israel, has not been heard from recently, leading some in the Israeli intelligence community to speculate that the leader of the terrorist group's forces in Gaza and, since August, head of the organization's politburo, may have died in an IDF airstrike several months ago. The IDF's Military Intelligence Directorate is taking seriously the possibility that Sinwar was in fact killed when Israeli warplanes bombed a tunnel where the terrorist leader was suspected to be hiding, Kan, Ma'ariv, Walla, and Ha'aretz all reported. No details were provided, however, regarding the strike in question. No clear evidence has yet been found indicating Sinwar has died, army sources cited by the reports emphasized, and the Hamas chief's possible death remains entirely speculative at this point. According to a report by The Jerusalem Post, there is no consensus within Israel's intelligence community as to the likelihood of Sinwar having been killed or the significance of his recent months-long silence. This is not the first time security officials have speculated regarding Sinwar's possible death. Multiple rumors were floated and leaked to the press last December after a lull in communications by the Hamas leader. In contrast to Israel's military intelligence establishment, the Shin Bet - the Jewish state's internal security agency and the country's primary counter-terror security service - is largely skeptical of the possibility Sinwar was killed in the airstrike in question, with the agency presuming Sinwar is still alive.

Netanyahu says half of the hostages held in Gaza are still alive ...	Netanyahu said it was Hamas, not Israel's government, that was to blame for the impasse in hostage release negotiation. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During a closed meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told MKs that just half of the 97 hostages remaining in Gaza are still alive. Of the hostages taken on October 7th, 33 have died after being taken as captives in Gaza. 'According to the information we have, half of the hostages in Gaza are alive,' he is quoted as saying by Army Radio. Netanyahu said it was Hamas, not Israel's government, that was to blame for the impasse in hostage release negotiation. In addition, the Prime Minister said he is mulling his generals' plans to seize northern Gaza. Last week, retired Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland presented a plan to 'change the reality on the ground' in Gaza. 'We have to tell the residents of north Gaza that they have one week to evacuate the territory, which then becomes a military zone, [a zone] in which every figure is a target and, most importantly, no supplies enter this territory,' General Eiland said. In June, American and Israeli intelligence predicted that there may be as few as 50 hostages still left alive in Gaza, the Wall Street Journal reported. The daily cited 'mediators in the hostage talks and a U.S. official familiar with the latest U.S. intelligence' as sources. Officially, on the Israeli side the IDF and Prime Minister's Office declined to comment, and on the American end the Office of the Director of National Intelligence kept mum as well when asked for a response. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari revealed that the IDF eliminated two terrorists who held the six murdered Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered in late August. The IDF retrieved the bodies of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Ori Danino, 25, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, and Carmel Gat, 40, in Rafah. They were shot in the head execution-style just two days before security forces discovered their bodies. Hagari reported that 'troops from the 162nd Division identified two terrorists emerging from an underground tunnel shaft in the Tel al-Sultan area and eliminated them during an encounter.'

Did an explosive beeper cause crash that killed previous Iranian ...	Gholamhossein Esmaili, the late Iranian president’s chief of staff reported that weather was not a factor in the death of President Ebrahim Raisi. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An explosive beeper similar to those that injured and killed Hezbollah terrorists last week might have played a role in the helicopter crash that killed Iranian President Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi in May. European-based Iranian journalist posted on X that Ahmad Bakhshayesh Ardestani, a member of the Iranian parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Committee said Raisi may have had one of the explosive-laden beepers when he was in a helicopter shortly before his death. Iranian media claimed that the crash that killed Raisi was caused by foul weather when the helicopter collided with a fog-covered mountain. However, Gholamhossein Esmaili, the late Iranian president’s chief of staff, told state television that weather was not a factor in the death of President Ebrahim Raisi. Esmaili was traveling in one of the two other helicopters in the air entourage that was making its way back from a ceremony inaugurating a dam on the border with Azerbaijan. 'The weather was clear, and completely bright and fine' when the flight began, he said. About half an hour into their trip, Raisi’s pilot ordered the three to rise above clouds that were on their level, but after about '30 seconds, [my] pilot noticed that the main helicopter was not with us,' he said. An offensive last week involved spontaneous explosion of thousands of beepers used by Hezbollah terrorists, wounding thousands and killing at least 37. Additional injuries and deaths occurred on Wednesday in Lebanon and in Syria, where 19 IRGC terrorists were killed and 150 were injured. A former commander of British military forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, praised the beeper offensive against Hezbollah as 'precise and discriminatory' and effective at weakening the morale and capacity of the Lebanese terror group. Israel’s outsmarting them with this terror attack has led to Hezbollah’s 'demoralization.' Kemp also praised the mission because it effectively targeted only terrorists and limited civilian casualties.

DeSantis: Two-state solution ‘stepping stone’ to end of Israel	In his address, DeSantis, who has cracked down on violent university demonstrations and fought against the boycott of Israel, said that chants of 'From the River to the Sea' common at the protests were calls for genocide. By JNS The two-state solution long backed by successive U.S. administrations and the international community to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a 'canard' that Palestinians view as a 'stepping stone to the destruction of Israel,' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said on Friday. 'It’s important for us in the United States to be very clear-eyed about what it means to be a strong ally of the State of Israel, and that means we should not embrace the canard of a two-state solution,' the Republican told the Israeli American Council summit in Washington. 'That is not seeking to have peace. They are seeking that as a stepping stone to the destruction of the Jewish state, and that is not acceptable!' In his address, the staunchly pro-Israel governor, who has cracked down on violent university demonstrations against Israel in the Sunshine State and fought against the boycott of Israel, said that chants of 'From the River to the Sea' common at the protests were calls for genocide. 'What you’re seeing on these college campuses, no question, is a lot of virulent antisemitism, a lot of hate. When you say, ‘From the River to the Sea’, you are chanting in favor of a second Holocaust. That’s what that means. 'I do think some of these students are just ignorant. I don’t think they even understand what they’re talking about. You hear some of them talking about ‘End the occupation of Palestine’. And I just think they need a little history lesson: There has never been a Palestinian Arab state!' DeSantis continued. He then offered a crash course in Israel 101. 'Prior to the First World War, you had hundreds of years of occupation under the Ottoman Empire. It was not a Palestinian Arab state. Then you had the British Mandate for Palestine. Then you had a Partition Plan from the U.N.—Jewish state and Arab state,' DeSantis said. 'The Jews accepted the state and founded Israel. The Arabs rejected the state and they went to war to try to eradicate Israel, and they lost. And they went to war again and they lost in 1967 and 1973 and throughout the intifadas, and so on! That land historically has no stronger connection to any group of people except the Jewish people. It goes about thousands of years. Read your Bible!' Earlier this year, DeSantis signed into laws bill on antisemitism and on Jewish school security, including one which codifies the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, and another allocating state security funding for full-time Jewish day schools and preschools. He has also spoken out against the often violent campus demonstrations against Jewish students this past year, saying that he would not allow that to happen in Florida, which has become a go-to state for Jews fleeing New York.

Iran’s ‘Torture Master’ dies after brain surgery	He was involved in suppressing student protests in 2009 and was accused of personally escalating sentences for political prisoners. By Jewish Breaking News A notorious Iranian interrogator has reportedly died following brain surgery on Saturday. Reza Seraj’s career in Iran’s security apparatus spanned decades and was marked by controversy. Beginning in the 1990s, he rose through the ranks as a senior interrogator within IRGC Intelligence. Operating under the alias 'Alavi,' Seraj became notorious for extracting forced confessions through pressure and torture. Throughout his career, Seraj held various high-ranking positions, including head of the Student Basij, political deputy of Sarallah Headquarters in Tehran, and head of the Special IRGC Intelligence Directorate. He was involved in suppressing student protests in 2009 and was accused of personally escalating sentences for political prisoners, according to Iran International. In 2023, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Seraj for his role in overseas assassination plots and human rights abuses in Iran. He was also implicated in violent incidents against inmates, including the 'Black Thursday' attack in Evin Prison in 2014. Despite accusations from former political prisoners and activists about his involvement in torture and forced confessions, IRGC Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami praised Seraj for his role in confronting anti-government protests. 'Seraj played a significant role in confronting sedition and raising awareness in dealing with various deviations that threatened the Islamic Revolution,' Salami said in a statement.

On Thursday, France voted in favor of a United Nations General Assembly resolution proposed by the Palestinian Authority to impose sanctions and an arms embargo on Israel. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Emmanuel Macron held a difficult conversation last week over the escalating situation in Lebanon, Israel’s Channel 12 reported on Friday. According to the report, Macron, who initiated the call, hurled harsh accusations at the Israeli premier for leading Israel and Lebanon to the brink of a full-scale war. 'The responsibility to prevent escalation is yours. You can opt for a diplomatic solution. This is the moment to show leadership and responsibility. Your activity in the north is pushing the region to war,' Macron was quoted in the report as saying. Netanyahu replied: 'Instead of putting the pressure on us, it’s about time you pressured Hezbollah. We will bring our residents back home [in the north]. This is the decision we made this week and we will act on it.' On Thursday, France voted in favor of a United Nations General Assembly resolution proposed by the Palestinian Authority to impose sanctions and an arms embargo on Israel. Israeli officials expressed their disappointment over Paris’s stance, including its inability to put diplomatic pressure on Hezbollah to end its hostilities, Channel 12 reported. 'You, the French, do what you still think you must diplomatically do and we will do what we must do,' senior officials in Jerusalem said in the report. A French source noted that 'a diplomatic agreement in the north is still possible, on condition that all sides take responsibility. The latest security developments are worrying because they fuel a new dynamic of escalation.' Macron expressed his sympathies with the Lebanese people in footage uploaded to X, saying that 'escalation is in no one’s interest.' In the wake of the two-day attack across Lebanon in which pagers and walkie-talkie communication devices held by Hezbollah operatives exploded, killing dozens and injuring thousands more, Macron noted that Lebanon should not 'live in fear of an imminent war.' He said that 'nothing—no regional adventure, no private interests, no faithfulness to any cause whatsoever—is worth launching a conflict in Lebanon over. Lebanon’s integrity, security and sovereignty must be preserved,' he added. This was not the first time Macron has been critical of Israel and Netanyahu. In March, he said that the forcible transfer of Gazans from Rafah ahead of a prospective Israeli military operation in the city would constitute a 'war crime.' The French president further stated that Paris was planning to circulate a draft resolution at the U.N. Security Council calling for 'an immediate and lasting ceasefire.'

Family reveals Hamas tortured Israeli hostage before execution	The 23-year-old’s last words were: 'They’ve caught me.' By Jewish Breaking News In a chilling interview with CNN, the sisters of slain hostage Eden Yerushalmi revealed the abuse she had endured while in captivity under Hamas. Eden was working as a bartender at the Nova music festival on October 7 when Hamas launched its unprovoked attack on Israel. As sirens sounded, Eden sent a video of rocket fire to her family group chat, informing them she was leaving the festival. For four hours, she spoke with her sisters May and Shani, who heard her desperate attempts to escape. The 23-year-old’s last words were: 'They’ve caught me.' Over the following months, the family received proof of life on three occasions, with the last coming just three weeks before Eden’s death. 'We feel like we’re in a nightmare,' Shani Yerushalmi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. 'Sometimes it feels like it isn’t real, like it’s not happening to us, because the whole time we truly believed that Eden would come back home alive.' Based on information from the Israel Defense Forces, the family learned that she was kept Hamas’ vast network of underground terror tunnels in Gaza. 'They barely could stand fully … they couldn’t sleep next to each other, only in a line. There were no windows, no air, no light. Barely any food, and if they needed to go to the bathroom, they were forced to do it in a bucket,' Shani said. Tragically, Eden’s body was among six recovered by the IDF in late August from a tunnel beneath Rafah. The military informed the family that Eden had been shot in the head from close range and had defensive wounds on her hands. An autopsy revealed Eden weighed just 79 pounds at the time of her death. 'We gave her a last hug to say goodbye to her. She was so thin, we could feel her bones sticking out,' recounted May Yerushalmi. 'The most important thing is that she was a hero, and she survived 11 months in those tunnels.' 'They starved her before they murdered her.' The sisters of murdered hostage Eden Yerushalmi speak with Anderson Cooper: 'It feels like it’s not real. Like it’s not happening to us.

Report: Biden admin backs UN bid to shield Oct. 7th perpetrators ...	The Biden Justice Department is reportedly backing a bid by the United Nations to provide legal immunity to UNRWA employees involved in the atrocities of October 7th. By World Israel News Staff The United Nations has filed paperwork in an American court in a bid to secure legal immunity for suspected participants in the October 7th atrocities in southwestern Israel who were employed by a UN agency at the time of the massacres, Channel 12 News reported Saturday night. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, has been under fire following revelations that a number of its employees have ties to Gaza terrorist groups including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Furthermore, a number of UNRWA employees are suspected of having taking part in the invasion of Israel on October 7th and the subsequent massacres and other atrocities. While Israel provided the UN with information on over 100 UNRWA employees suspected of being active members in Hamas, the agency performed an internal investigation on only 19 of the employees, finding that 9 of them 'may have been involved' in the October 7th atrocities, the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) ruled. Now, according to Saturday's report, the UN is working to shield the suspects from prosecution, relying on the functional immunity provided to the organization's employees. In its filing with an American court, the UN invoked its functional immunity, arguing that pending legal action against UNRWA should be dismissed. 'Since the UN has not waived immunity in this instance, its subsidiary, UNRWA, continues to enjoy absolute immunity from prosecution, and the lawsuit should be dismissed,' the UN is quoted as writing in the filing. The Justice Department has reportedly given its endorsement of the UN's invocation of immunity. 'The plaintiff's complaint does not present a legal basis for claiming that the United Nations waived its immunity. Therefore, because the UN has not waived immunity in this case, its subsidiary, UNRWA, retains full immunity, and the lawsuit against UNRWA should be dismissed due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction.' While the functional immunity does not bar the victims harmed on October 7th or relatives of those murdered from seeking damages from the United Nations for the actions of their employees, it does raise legal challenges to such law suits, requiring that the plaintiffs prove the need to strip the UNRWA employees of their immunity.

Members of progressive 'Squad' accuse conservative magazine of 'racism' after it publishes cartoon portraying anti-Israel congresswoman with exploding Hezbollah pager. By World Israel News Staff Far-left Democratic lawmakers, collectively dubbed the 'Squad,' castigated a cartoon published by a conservative magazine and a right-leaning newspaper last week, accusing the outlets of promoting 'racism' and 'Islamophobia.' Last Tuesday and Wednesday, in a series of bombings attributed to Israel, thousands of pagers and hand-held radios exploded simultaneously in three separate attacks across Syria and Lebanon. The devices had been issued by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terror group to its operatives, and were apparently triggered after being packed with miniature bombs. Dozens were killed and thousands injured in the attacks. On Thursday, The National Review, a center-right magazine published a cartoon by Henry Payne, featuring Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian-American and member of the far-left 'Squad,' with the remains of a detonated pager on her desk, saying 'Odd. My pager just exploded,' implicitly linking the Israel-critic to Hezbollah. The cartoon, drawn by Henry Payne and published in the National Review and Detroit News. (X) The cartoon was also picked up by The Detroit News, a paper with a right-leaning editorial board. New York Congresswoman and fellow Squad member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned the cartoon, calling it an expression of 'anti-Arab hatred' and 'Islamophobia.' 'The way Islamophobia and anti-Arab hatred is so deeply normalized and accepted in our politics is horrifying,' tweeted Ocasio-Cortez. 'It rarely receives the equal condemnation it deserves. It is inexcusable and a massive double standard. This is disgusting. And so is the silence around it. We see it.' Missouri Congresswoman Cori Bush took aim at both The National Review and the Detroit News for publishing what she called 'Islamophobic trash.' 'NRO, DetroitNews, you should be ashamed for spewing this filth, betraying any shred of journalistic integrity, and putting communities in danger. You chose hate over truth. You’ve failed your readers and your community.' Tlaib herself weighed in on the cartoon, calling it 'disgraceful.' 'Our community is already in so much pain right now,' Tlaib tweeted. 'This racism will incite more hate + violence against our Arab & Muslim communities, and it makes everyone less safe. It’s disgraceful that the media continues to normalize this racism.'

Inside Israel’s pager and walkie talkie attacks	The operation took years of work, and was individually directed at the Hezbollah men who were wounded or killed. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News New details about the years-long effort Israel put into its alleged pager-walkie talkie attacks on Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday last week, emerged in a Saturday night report by Channel 12. Israel knew that Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah had ordered his men to stop using cellular devices years ago and move to more primitive devices out of fear that Israel could compromise the terror organization’s communications. According to Ronen Bergman, an investigative reporter for The New York Times and Yedioth Ahronoth cited in the report, instead of trying to intercept deliveries of beepers and walkie talkies to tamper with them, Israel decided to create a factory that produced them, with all the special changes included, and attract Hezbollah operatives to make a large purchase. Creating the devices was a hugely challenging technical task, a senior foreign security official told the news channel. 'The operation handled tens of thousands of pagers,' the official said. 'This is a worldwide operation that included a lot of technologies that were supposed to undergo acceptance tests at the customer, to hide explosive and spying mechanisms - without the devices being overweight [or] having a different shape - and that they could be used in the normal way.' According to another foreign official, the report said, the attacks were also very carefully calibrated in order to strike only terrorists. 'Each pager has its own serial number,' the official said. 'That way it was possible to control who would be hit and wouldn’t be.' Although videos showed how people standing next to victims were unhurt when their devices exploded, Lebanese media reported that at least two youngsters were killed in the Tuesday attack. It is possible that they were bringing the beeping pagers to their owners when they detonated. Possibly in line with the idea that individuals were deliberately targeted, Qatar Airways is reportedly now not allowing anyone boarding their planes from Lebanon's international airport to have either beepers or walkie talkies, in their carry-ons or checked luggage. It had also been widely reported that the IDF pushed the button that caused the thousands of communication devices to explode, killing at least 30 and wounding over 3,000, because Israel was afraid that its tampering was about to be discovered. Citing a senior foreign official who spoke with one of the operation’s commanders, the report said that this was not true. 'I spoke with several senior officials who strongly maintain that the operation was under threat of exposure every few months, this was nothing new,' the official said. 'There was indeed concern, but it was on the table at the highest levels even beforehand, because the army is not managing to defeat Hezbollah. There was a need to shift gears and this was one of the options on the table.' The point, said Maj. Gen. (res.) Amos Yadlin, a former head of Military Intelligence, was to cause Nasrallah to 'understand that continuing to fire on the north costs him much more than what he gains' by continuing to fire rockets and UAVs at Israel. The Iranian terror proxy has launched well over 8,000 airborne threats of various types from Lebanon in the 11+ months since the war began, driving 60,000 Israelis out of their homes on the border to limbo in hotels and other temporary places of safety further south. One major cost Israel is hoping for, said the report, is the erosion of support of the Lebanese people. 'There is no Shia house in Lebanon that does not contain at least one injured person. Some families are coming to Nasrallah and saying, 'What the hell?'' said Bergman. The attack also overloaded the country’s health system, with the thousands of injured rushed to hospitals in the immediate aftermath. The considerable number who will need long-term care or rehabilitation services will also strain the system, perhaps contributing to the population’s further disenchantment with Hezbollah. Israel isn’t done yet, either, as IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said on Wednesday. The Jewish state has 'many more capabilities' that it has yet to use against Hezbollah, and the army stands ready 'to do whatever is required' to enable the evacuated residents in the north to finally return home 'with a high level of security,' he said.

Northern Israeli hospitals moving underground	The safety measures were ordered as heavy Hezbollah rocket barrages have been fired as far south as Haifa. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News All hospitals in Israel’s north are moving their patients to protected spaces and even underground as a result of the heavy rocket barrages Hezbollah has launched since very early Sunday morning. Rambam Hospital in Haifa is shifting to its reinforced underground parking lot, which was prepared long ago with the infrastructure needed to care for patients in this alternative space. 'Due to the current escalation in the north,' said Rambam Director Prof. Michael Halbertal, 'according to the orders of the Homefront Command, the hospital is preparing to deal with &#8230; Alert Level 3.' 'This means that for the first time, the whole hospital is going down' to the vast protected space,' he added, and would stay there until further notice. The process of transferring patients, and moving all the medical equipment to the parking lot, will take 12 hours, he noted. Halbertal made a point of saying that anyone who needs emergency care should 'not hesitate' to come to the hospital, as 'the emergency rooms are working as usual.' Six other hospitals, including those in Tiberius and Nazareth, will now also operate from protective spaces until further notice. A seventh, the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya, had already had most of its functions based in its underground shelter for nearly a full year, since the start of the war. The Emek Medical Center in Afula announced that its delivery rooms, which were already in reinforced areas, are operating regularly as the staff prepares to evacuate the upper floors to its underground complex. In all the hospitals, elective and non-emergency surgeries have been canceled for now and outpatient clinics closed. They are also releasing all patients who can possibly go home. The hospitals have trained their staff for such a situation, and all swung into action immediately upon receiving the official notice. The Health Ministry has also been working with the northern hospitals for months to prepare them for a worst-case scenario in which each medical facility is on its own. The ministry’s director-general, Moshe Bar Siman Tov, spoke about this just last week at a health conference. 'We know that war is the so-called kingdom of chaos, and unexpected things will happen and we’ll have to deal with things in the end that we probably haven’t faced before,' he said. 'It’s possible that the hospitals will be what we call ‘a desert island,’ disconnected, and they will be the ones who will have to make the decisions,' he continued. 'We’ll help them with manpower, we’ll help them with equipment, but there will be many things here that we will really experience for the first time.' Part of the preparations for such a situation included the stockpiling of medications and blood supplies at each medical center. The hundreds of Hezbollah missile launches are its attempt to retaliate for the IDF assassinations over the weekend of over a dozen of the terror group's top commanders, as well as the pager and walkie talkie explosions last week that killed more than 30 Hezbollah operatives and wounded some 3,000.

‘We killed terrorists plotting a new October 7th’ – Herzog defend...	Israel's president defends strike on Hezbollah leaders and wave of pager bombings in Lebanon, telling UK media outlet Lebanon has been 'hijacked' by the pro-Iranian terror group. By World Israel News Staff Israeli President Isaac Herzog defended recent targeted Israeli attacks on members of the pro-Iranian Lebanon-based terrorist group Hezbollah in an appearance on the British media outlet Sky News on Sunday. Four Israelis were injured in a massive wave of Hezbollah rocket and missile attacks on northern Israel Saturday night and Sunday morning. On Friday, the Israeli Air Force eliminated 16 senior members of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force in an airstrike on a Hezbollah position in the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut. The airstrike came just days after a at least three waves of bombing attacks targeted pagers and hand-held radios issued by Hezbollah to its operatives across Lebanon and Syria, leaving dozens dead and thousands injured. In his interview with Sky News' Trevor Phillips, President Herzog said that the sixteen Radwan Force members eliminated in Friday's strike were plotting an invasion of northern Israel similar to the Hamas atrocities in southwestern Israel on October 7th. 'The simple message of Israel: we do not want war. We absolutely did not seek this war,' said Herzog. 'We do not want to get into a war with Lebanon, but Lebanon has been hijacked by a terror organization which is also a political party in Lebanon called Hezbollah.' 'It's been armed to its teeth by the Iranian empire of evil, and all of these leaders who were eradicated on Friday by the Israeli attack, all of these leaders were meeting together in order to launch the same horrific, horrendous attack that we had on October 7th by Hamas, by burning Israelis, butchering them, raping their women, abducting and taking hostage old people and young, and little babies – so this is exactly the same plan that they've been planning for years under the empire of evil of Iran.' Herzog emphasized that Israel has 'restrained' itself in its response to Hezbollah attacks since last October, but added that the country must fulfill its 'natural obligation' to protect its citizens in the north, noting that tens of thousands remain evacuated due to Hezbollah attacks. 'Hezbollah started this war. It started following the horrendous attack of Hamas on October 7, Hezbollah since then has been bombarding us endlessly. Almost 100,000 Israelis have been evacuated from their homes. The entire North has been shattered. We kept on being restrained and restrained and restrained, but something has to end. We have to bring our citizens back to their homes. That's the most natural obligation of any nation to its citizens.'

Washington ‘worried’ by slaying of terrorist who killed US soldie...	Israeli strike that killed terrorist responsible for bombings is 'very concerning,' says Biden administration official. By World Israel News Staff Biden administration officials praised a recent Israeli airstrike that killed a senior Hezbollah leader, but expressed their concerns that the assassination would lead to an all-out war between Israel and the terror group. On Friday, Israeli jets carried out a targeted airstrike on a building in Dahiyeh, a Beirut suburb and Hezbollah stronghold. Senior Radwan Force commander Ibrahim Aqil was killed in the bombing. Before his slaying, the U.S. had offered a $7 million reward for information leading to Aqil's arrest, due to his inovlvement in a 1983 bombing that killed 241 American soldiers in Beirut. 'Any time a terrorist who has murdered Americans is brought to justice, we believe that that is a good outcome,' National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said at a press conference shortly after the srike. 'That individual has American blood on his hands and has a Reward for Justice price on his head,' Sullivan added. 'He is somebody who the United States promised long ago we would do everything we could to see brought to justice.' Sullivan said that he believe Aqil's assassination had brought relief to those whose loved ones were murdered in the bombing, some 40 years ago. 'You know 1983 seems like a long time ago,' he said. 'But for a lot of families and a lot of people, they’re still living with it every day.' However, Sullivan said he was worried that Israel's strike would Speaking at the Israeli-American Council Confernece on Friday, White House Mideast czar Brett McGurk also praised the strike. However, McGurk quikcly segued into deanding that Israel step back from taking military action against Hezbollah, despite some eleven months of non-stop rocket fire from the terror group on Israel's north. 'Nobody sheds a tear' for Aqil, McGurk said. 'That said, we have disagreements with the Israelis on tactics and how you kind of measure escalation risk. It is a very concerning situation. I’m very confident that through diplomacy, through deterrence and other means, we’ll work our way out of it,' he added. 'We do not think a war in Lebanon is the way to achieve the objective, to return people to their homes. We also fully stand with Israel in their defense of their people and their territory against Hezbollah,' McGurk continued. 'We want a diplomatic settlement to the north. That is the objective, and that’s what we’re working towards.'

Hezbollah ‘didn’t imagine’ how hard Israel would strike, says Net...	After wave of pager and radio bombings, Israeli prime minister vows IDF will continue to hit Hezbollah until the Lebanese terror group 'gets the message'. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted at a major escalation in the simmering conflict between Israel and the Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah, saying Sunday that Israel would continue to ramp up attacks on the Lebanese organization until it 'gets the message.' In a pair of video statements, recorded in Hebrew and English, Netanyahu vowed to secure Israel's northern border and restore security to towns across the Galilee and Golan Heights, as tens of thousands of residents remain evacuated nearly a year after the latest round of fighting began between Israel and Hezbollah on October 8th of last year. 'On October 7th, the Hamas terrorist monsters burst into Israel, murdered our people, raped and beheaded our women, burnt babies alive, and took 255 innocent people hostage, including many Americans,' Netanyahu said. 'A day later, on October 8th, another Iranian terrorist proxy, Hezbollah, attacked Israel completely unprovoked. They fired missiles and rockets into our cities. They made 60,000 Israelis leave their homes along the Lebanon border, becoming refugees in their own land.' 'In the subsequent months, they haven't stopped for a single day attacking us. No country can accept the wanton rocketing of its cities. We can't accept it either.' 'We will take whatever action is necessary to restore security and to bring our people safe back to their homes.' In the Hebrew video statement, Netanyahu alluded to a series of explosions across Lebanon and Syria last week, in which thousands of pagers and hand-held radios issued by Hezbollah to its operatives exploded simultaneously. 'Over the past few days we hit Hezbollah with a string of strikes that it didn’t imagine,' Netanyahu said, hinting at greater measures should the terror group fail to 'get the message.' 'If Hezbollah didn’t get the message, I promise you, it will get the message.'

‘Canard’ – Florida governor warns two-state solution would mean e...	Florida Governor Ron DeSantis blasts international calls for Palestinian statehood, saying two-state solution is just a 'stepping stone' to annihilation of the Jewish state. By World Israel News Staff Florida Governor and former contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination Ron DeSantis condemned the two-state solution to the Israel-Arab conflict, calling it a 'stepping stone' to the destruction of the the State of Israel. Speaking at the annual Israel American Council summit in Washington D.C. over the weekend, DeSantis accused the Democratic party of catering to radical 'pro-Hamas' elements in the party's far-left base, while turning a blind eye to the rising specter of antisemitism on college campuses. 'It is pathetic that our nation’s oldest and largest political party feels the need to cater to its very own pro-Hamas pockets. If they were in my party, I’d want them to be kicked out of our Republican Party,' DeSantis said. 'What you're seeing on these college campuses, no question, is a lot of virulent antisemitism, a lot of hate. When you say ‘from the river to the sea’, you are chanting in favor of a second Holocaust. That's what that means.' 'I do think some of these students are just ignorant. I don't think they understand even what they're talking about. You hear some of them talking about ‘end the occupation of Palestine’. And I just think they need a little history lesson: There has never been a Palestinian Arab state!' DeSantis also criticized advocates for Palestinian statehood, warning that Israel's enemies are pursuing a two-state solution not as an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict, but as a means to annihilate the State of Israel. 'It's important for us in the United States to be very clear-eyed about what it means to be a strong ally of the State of Israel, and that means we should not embrace the canard of a two-state solution. That is not seeking to have peace. They are seeking that as a stepping stone to the destruction of the Jewish state and that is not acceptable!' 'You had a Partition Plan from the UN - Jewish state and Arab state,' DeSantis continued, referencing the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181, a non-binding measure passed by the international body in November, 1947. 'The Jews accepted the state and founded Israel. The Arabs rejected the state and they went to war to try to eradicate Israel, and they lost. And they went to war again and they lost in 1967 and 1973 and throughout the intifadas, and so no! That land historically has no stronger connection than any group of people except the Jewish people. It goes about thousands of years. Read your Bible!'

It is time for all countries with the mission of protecting world peace to come up with solutions that will stop Israel,' Erdoğan said. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Attacks on Lebanon this week 'It is time for all countries with the mission of protecting world peace to come up with solutions that will stop Israel,' Erdoğan said.showed that the Israeli government planned to spread the war to the region, Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdoğan said on Saturday, calling on Western countries to take 'deterrent steps' against Israel’s actions. Erdoğan told a press conference that Israel’s war in Gaza will top the agenda of his speech at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. 'In order for our region not to be dragged into a great disaster, the pressure on Israel must be increased even more,' Erdoğan told a press conference in Istanbul. He was commenting on attacks in Lebanon this week, including the explosion of Hezbollah members’ pagers and walkie-talkies that killed 39 people. The attacks on communications devices were widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. 'It is time for all countries with the mission of protecting world peace to come up with solutions that will stop Israel,' Erdoğan said. 'In order to end this oppression that has been going on for almost a year, to establish a permanent ceasefire and to ensure the unhindered flow of humanitarian aid, all of us, the whole world and especially the UN, have important duties,' he said. Turkey has denounced Israel’s actions in Gaza, which came in retaliation to Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct.7. Ankara has also halted all trade with Israel and submitted a request to join South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide. Israel has repeatedly dismissed the case’s accusations of genocide as baseless.

Gov’t okays five-year plan to transform Beersheva into metropolis	High-speed rail lines, a light-rail system, and long-term rental housing solutions are among the key projects slated for implementation. By JNS Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office and Finance Ministry have agreed on a five-year budget plan aimed at establishing Beersheva as a thriving metropolis, the PMO announced on Thursday. According to the PMO, the initiative comes as part of a broader strategy to revitalize the Negev. The cornerstone of the development plan is the relocation of key Israel Defense Forces units to the Negev, scheduled to commence in late 2025. The move is expected to serve as a catalyst for significant economic and demographic growth in the area, the PMO stated. The comprehensive plan, set to be submitted for government approval by year’s end, addresses critical infrastructure needs, including transportation, housing, employment and economic development. High-speed rail lines, a light-rail system and long-term rental housing solutions are among the key projects slated for implementation. 'This is a significant step that will enable us to face the challenges ahead, including the IDF’s relocation to the south,' said Beersheva Mayor Rubik Danilovich. 'We all understand that the Negev is the solution for the State of Israel. Now is the time to make dramatic decisions that will shape the country’s future and establish Beersheva as Israel’s leading metropolis. This is a national mission and a national interest!' Beersheva’s city engineer, Tamar Poria Adar, warned that the Negev would lose its Jewish majority within about 20 years unless decisive action is taken. This demographic shift, according to local leaders, is a direct consequence of years of neglect and insufficient investment in the region. Many residents of the south, while cautiously optimistic, remain wary. Yehuda Benano, chairman of the 'Residents for the Negev' organization, responded, 'The plans are ready in the drawer, and now is the time to act to ensure a Jewish majority that will live securely, prosperously and healthily, just like the residents of central Israel.' One concrete move in this direction, according to Health Minister Uriel Boss, is the recent approval for a second hospital in Beersheva, set to open by 2028 with approximately 600 beds. 'We are advancing another step in realizing the vision to reduce the gaps between the periphery and the center, and to provide equal rights to advanced health services for every citizen in the State of Israel,regardless of their place of residence, community affiliation, or economic situation,' Bosso said in a statement.

Israel formally challenges potential ICC arrest warrants against ...	The ICC has no jurisdiction as Jerusalem is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the court. By JNS Israel filed an official petition to the International Criminal Court that it drop the prosecutor’s request to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the Foreign Ministry announced on Friday. 'Israel initiated two separate legal proceedings,' the Foreign Ministry statement read. The first legal case challenges the legal authority of the ICC to file such arrest warrants, the statement said. The second proceeding argues that chief prosecutor Karim Khan violated the court’s constitution and the principle of complementarity by not granting Israel the right to investigate itself the claims made by the ICC. 'Various leading countries (including member states of the ICC), organizations, and legal experts from around the world share the positions presented by Israel on these issues,' the Foreign Ministry stated. 'No other democracy with an independent and respected judicial system—as exists in the State of Israel—has received such discriminatory treatment from the prosecutor,' the statement went on to say. 'Despite this, Israel remains steadfast in its commitment to the rule of law and justice, and will continue to protect its citizens from the ongoing attacks and atrocities of Hamas and Iran’s other terrorist affiliates, in accordance with international law.' Earlier in the month, Khan pressed ICC’s Pre-Trial Chamber to file the arrest warrants, urging action ahead of Netanyahu’s scheduled address to the United Nations General Assembly on Sep. 27, Israel’s Ynet outlet reported. 'The prosecution respectfully requests that the Chamber issue its decision on the applications for the warrants of arrest against Yahya Sinwar, [Mohammed] Deif, Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant with utmost urgency,' Khan wrote in a six-page letter to the ICC justices. Netanyahu excoriated the chief prosecutor, stating that the comparison between Israelis and Hamas terrorists is 'pure antisemitism.' 'Unfortunately, we have seen from the beginning that the proceedings in The Hague are politically biased and have no professional legal basis whatsoever,' the premier added in a statement published by his office. The ICC has no jurisdiction as Jerusalem is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the court. But in a legalistic sleight of hand, the court claimed jurisdiction by accepting 'Palestine' as a signatory in 2015, even though no such state exists under international law. The 123 countries that are signatories to the Rome Statute are obligated to act on any arrest warrant it issues, raising the possibility that the two Israeli leaders could be placed under arrest while visiting these places.

IDF shutters Al Jazeera offices in Ramallah: Report	IDF soldiers raid Al Jazeera offices, present bureau chief with 45-day closure order. By World Israel News Staff Israeli security forces raided the offices of the Al Jazeera news agency in Ramallah on Sunday morning, ordering the network's closure for the next 45 days. According to the Qatar-controlled Arabic-language outlet, Israeli soldiers entered the Palestinian Authority-administered enclave to present Al Jazeera's local bureau chief, Walid al-Omari, with an official closure order. Al-Omar bemoaned the decision, accusing Israel of media suppression. 'Targeting journalists this way always aims to erase the truth and prevent people from hearing the truth,' he said. Al Jazeera reporter Nida Ibrahim said the move 'was not a surprise,' after an Israeli court authorized the country's communications minister to shut down the network in Israeli territory. The 45-day closures, which began in May 2024, has been renewed multiple times, preventing Al Jazeera from broadcasting in the country. However, up until today, Al Jazeera's operations in Ramallah were unaffected by the Israel ban. 'We’ve heard Israeli officials threatening to close down the bureau. We’ve heard the government discussing this, asking&#8230;to close down and shut down the channel. But we [had] not been expecting it to happen today,' Ibrahim said. The Hamas-controlled media ministry in the Gaza Strip condemned the move, calling it a 'heinous crime&#8230;that is a blatant violation of press and media freedom.' Hamas' concerns over freedom of speech are notable, as the terror group regularly tortures and murders Gazans who criticize them on social media. Numerous Al Jazeera journalists have been revealed to be members of Hamas and other terror groups. Recently, an Al Jazeera employee confessed that he participated in the October 7th terror onslaught, along with Islamic Jihad terrorists. During the ongoing war, several Al Jazeera journalists have been killed by Israeli airstrikes. While the network has tried to falsely spin that Israel is intentionally targeting its journalists, nearly all of those killed were traveling in vehicles alongside armed terrorists, or were armed themselves.

IDF kills terrorists who murdered six Israeli hostages in tunnel	The IDF retrieved the bodies of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Ori Danino, 25, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, and Carmel Gat, 40, in Rafah last month. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari revealed that the IDF eliminated two terrorists who held the six murdered Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered in late August. The IDF retrieved the bodies of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Ori Danino, 25, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, and Carmel Gat, 40, in Rafah. They were shot in the head execution-style just two days before their bodies were discovered by security forces. Hagari reported that 'troops from the 162nd Division identified two terrorists emerging from an underground tunnel shaft in the Tel al-Sultan area and eliminated them during an encounter.' He explained that the IDF was able to determine that the two neutralized terrorists were the ones who held the six murdered hostages by taking DNA samples from the equipment recovered after they fled and matching them with DNA collected in the tunnels where the hostages were held. 'Based on the findings and the information available to us, these terrorists that were killed were the same terrorists who were in the tunnel where the bodies of the six hostages were discovered,' said Hagari. 'The findings show they were there when they were murdered, and we are investigating their involvement in the murder. Should we obtain further information, we will first update the families and then the public,' Hagari added. Hagari concluded by saying the IDF will 'pursue and reach everyone responsible for this heinous murder, and we will not stop until we reach them all.' In addition to establishing the time of death and the cause of death, the forensic examinations showed that the hostages had suffered from neglect, that they had not bathed for a lengthy time, and that they had sustained severe injuries, which were later treated. The remains of the six captives were found without the benefit of intelligence information when a unit of IDF soldiers were traversing a tunnel under Rafah.

IDF announces new security restrictions for northern Israel	The restrictions apply to civilians from Haifa northward. By i24 and Algemeiner Staff Israel’s Home Front Command is issuing new security restrictions on civilians applying from the Haifa area and northward, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Spokesperson Daniel Hagari announced on Saturday. Hagari said educational institutions and workplaces are permitted to operate if an adequate shelter is nearby and can be reached in time. The official also announced restrictions on gatherings: Up to 30 people outdoors and 300 people indoors. The changes are unfolded as the IDF scales up its airstrikes against Hezbollah sites and rocket launchers in Lebanon.

Israel considers scrapping 200 shekel bill	Israel’s move is largely driven by its desire to combat black money transactions within the Arab sector. By Jewish Breaking News Israel may be on the verge of eliminating its largest banknote as part of an ambitious plan to combat crime. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated this massive economic reform during a Thursday meeting of the Subcommittee on Advancing the Fight Against Crime in the Arab Sector. At the meeting, he reportedly directed the Finance Minister and the Governor of the Bank of Israel to evaluate the feasibility of cancelling the 200 shekel note. According to Arutz Sheva, a plan is being drafted by a team of nine economists that proposes gradually phasing out the note. It would begin with the next printing cycle, followed by a brief transition period allowing citizens to exchange their existing 200 shekels. Within a few years the bill will be eliminated entirely. Israel’s move is largely driven by its desire to combat black money transactions within the Arab sector. Like most money laundering schemes, these illicit financial dealings frequently rely on high-value banknotes for their convenience and anonymity. However, some financial experts are warning of massive blowback from phasing out the 200 shekel note. They argue that sophisticated criminal networks will simply adapt by shifting to foreign currencies or more opaque digital alternatives. Meanwhile, small businesses, street vendors, and elderly individuals who rely on cash transactions will face financial exclusion. Furthermore, the costs of transitioning to a more cashless society, including investments in new payment infrastructure and public education, could be substantial.

IDF eliminates 16 Hezbollah Radwan commanders	Ibrahim Aqil was the top commander of the Radwan force and was planning an invasion of Galilee. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Friday, the IDF eliminated 16 top Hezbollah Radwan force commanders, including the leader Ibrahim Aqil. Israel's military operation targeted the Radwan Force commanders meeting in the basement of a building in the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut. Aqil was the top commander of the Radwan force and was planning an invasion of Galilee. Ahmed Wahbi, head of the Radwan training unit, was also eliminated. Wahbi was also heavily involved in planning the Galilee invasion and, according to the IDF, was 'advancing Hezbollah’s entrenchment in southern Lebanon while attempting to improve the organization’s ground combat capabilities.' Other terror Radwan commanders killed in the operation included Hassan Hussein, commander of special forces in the Aziz regional division; Samer Halawi, commander of the coastal region; Abbas Muslimani, commander of the Qana region; Abdullah Hijazi, commander of the Ramim Ridge region; Muhammad Reda, commander of the Khiam region; Hassan Madi, commander of the Mount Dov region; Hassan Abd al-Satar, head of operations; Hussein Hadraj, chief of staff; Mohammad al-Attar, commander of the training department; and Mahmoud Hamad, a senior operations officer. Concerning the operation, the IDF said, 'These Radwan terror commanders were plotting an attack and invasion into Israel's territory for years and were ready to carry out the plans at a moment's notice when given the order.' 'Aqil and the other commanders eliminated in the strike were responsible for planning and executing hundreds of terror attacks against Israelis, including the planned invasion of the Galilee,' the IDF announced. Hezbollah, which doesn't always acknowledge the elimination of their leaders, confirmed that Aqil and others had been killed and said his body had been recovered from under the rubble. The attack on Friday further damaged Hezbollah's leadership and capabilities after massive explosions of walkie-talkies used by terrorists. The beeper explosions wounded thousands of terrorists and killed 37.

By TPS A short while ago, an Israeli airstrike targeted a building in Beirut, according to initial reports killing senior Hezbollah official Ibrahim Aqil. According to Alma Research and Education center, Aqil, also known by his aliases Al Haj Abdul Khader and Haj Tahsin, was a prominent figure in Hezbollah’s military structure. He served on the group’s Jihad Council and was responsible for overseeing Hezbollah’s air and ground units, including the elite Radwan forces. Aqil’s significance in the organization traces back to his involvement in attacks against American targets in Lebanon in 1983, alongside notorious operative Imad Mughniyeh.

Aqil reportedly had faced internal criticism recently over his handling of military operations during the ongoing war. According to the Department of State website, the U.S. government offers a reward up to 7 million dollars for information leading to his capture, citing his involvement in past terrorist activities. While Israeli officials await Hezbollah’s formal acknowledgment of Aqil’s death, Hezbollah-affiliated media have issued instructions not to spread rumors to avoid 'playing into the enemy’s hands.'

IDF and security forces eliminate terrorist leader in Judea and S...	Shadi Zakarneh was killed alongside other terrorists by an IAF strike on his vehicle after Shin Bet saw him traveling in Qabatiya. By World Israel News Staff On Thursday, the IDF and Israel's security forces (Shin Bet) eliminated a terror leader who planned numerous attacks in Northern Samaria. Shadi Zakarneh was killed alongside other terrorists by an IAF strike on his vehicle after Shin Bet saw him traveling in Qabatiya. The strike that killed Zkarneh also eliminated two other terrorists in the vehicle and a strike on an additional vehicle killed three others. The second vehicle was laden with explosives, and the strike caused multiple blasts. As part of the operation, four wanted security forces arrested terrorists. Troops from the elite Dudevan unit killed four terrorists during the battle and confiscated weapons belonging to the terrorists. The United Nations General Assembly is slated to vote on a new draft resolution that would, if passed, demand Israel ethnically cleanse Judea and Samaria of its Jewish population. The text of the draft calls explicitly for the end of Israel’s presence in Judea and Samaria and a full withdrawal of military forces and Israeli civilian populations,' Channel 12 reported Monday. The draft resolution will be placed on the General Assembly’s docket during its upcoming 79th session, slated to open on Tuesday. According to Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon, the General Assembly will vote on the resolution sometime next week. In addition to demanding Israel terminate its military and civilian presence in Judea and Samaria, the resolution calls on U.N. member states to impose sanctions on Israeli leaders and to adopt arms embargos on the Jewish state. In a statement late Sunday night, Danon excoriated the Palestinian Authority mission for submitting the draft, and called on the General Assembly to reject the proposal. 'The resolution calls, among other things, for the end of an Israeli presence in ‘the Palestinian territories’ within six months, the IDF’s withdrawal from ‘the territories,’ a halt to ‘settlements,’ and the return of [Palestinians] ‘to their land’. 'If this resolution passes in the General Assembly, especially on the one-year anniversary of the October 7th massacre — the deadliest attack against Jews since the Holocaust — it will be a reward for terrorism and a message to the world that the barbaric slaughter of children, the rape of women and the kidnapping of innocent civilians is a worthwhile tactic.' 'I call on the General Assembly to reject this disgraceful resolution outright, and instead adopt a resolution condemning Hamas and calling for the immediate release of all hostages. Let it be clear: nothing will stop Israel or deter it from its mission to bring home the hostages and eliminate Hamas.'

The deadly pager operation in Lebanon is no laughing matter. Or i...	A man dressed as an Orthodox Jew sits behind a table reading Honest Shlomo’s discount pagers. By Andrew Silow-Carroll, JTA First came the explosions. Then came the jokes. Within minutes of news that several members of Hezbollah were killed and hundreds wounded by pagers that had been doctored to explode en masse, allegedly by Israel, Jews on social media shared memes celebrating the operation and mocking its targets. Examples: A man dressed as an Orthodox Jew sits behind a table reading 'Honest Shlomo’s discount pagers.' A pager’s message reads '72 Virgins,' a reference to the concept that Muslim martyrs will be rewarded with 72 maidens in heaven. Some attributed the message to 'Moti Rola,' a spurious Hebrew name riffing on the Motorola brand. Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, takes a call from a follower boasting that he found a good deal on the electronic devices. And because the pagers were presumably in the pockets of Hezbollah operatives, castration was a popular theme. One cartoon shows a dead Hezbollah man arriving in heaven to greet his virgins, who gasp at his missing genitals. The jokes continued on Wednesday, with news that walkie-talkies wired to explode had killed at least 25 in Lebanon. 'No more walkie. No more talkie,' wrote David Hazony, director and fellow at the Z3 Institute for Jewish Priorities, on X. The taunting memes and jokes came as a war on another front, in Gaza, grinds on; as negotiations over a ceasefire and efforts to free the Israeli hostages are at a standstill; and as Israel is still reeling from the murder of six hostages earlier last month who were seemingly on the verge of their rescue. For some, the humor is a release valve, celebrating what feels like a rare, clear Israeli 'win' in its second-front battle against an enemy that has fired rockets into the country’s evacuated north on a near-daily basis. For others, however, the mockery crosses a line, and violates a traditional Jewish ethic that discourages undue rejoicing over the deaths of one’s enemy. Laughing also became harder for some as it became clear that while the attacks were a long-planned operation designed to target Hezbollah operatives, others had been harmed, including children who were killed. Sometimes, both sentiments are being felt simultaneously. For Rabbi Ariel Rackovsky, of Congregation Shaare Tefilla, an Orthodox synagogue in Dallas, the memes were both humorous and troubling. 'Candidly, I thought they were hilarious,' he said in an interview. 'From the perspective of Jewish tradition, certainly for Israelis to be engaging in dark humor is absolutely a legitimate way to deal with stress.' Dear Hezbollah,There’s no other way. A little humor. The memes coming out are crazy. pic.twitter.com/yVhjk5alUi &mdash; Nancy Mako (@NancyMako) September 18, 2024 He quoted rabbis, including the 19th-century Modern Orthodox pioneer Raphael Samson Hirsch and Daniel Z. Feldman, a leading rabbi at Yeshiva University’s rabbinic seminary, who said humor is an appropriate response to stress. 'But at the same time, after that perhaps initial reaction, I think that is worth being a little more circumspect,' continued Rackovsky, who posted on Facebook about his ambivalence. 'After all, our tradition does teach us that we should not celebrate excessively over the downfall of our enemies.' The emotion he endorsed in his Facebook post was 'gratitude' to God for the success of the operation. 'We should absolutely be thankful to God, but maybe not hand out candies, and not just because the optics of that are not great,' he said. Rackovsky may have been referring to another widely shared video, of Israelis handing out candy in Jerusalem following the operation in Lebanon — a gesture often reported in Arab communities after terror attacks in Israel. In response to that video, Ori Riddleman, an X user with 8,500 followers, asked in Hebrew, 'When did the phenomenon begin that we began to imitate the behavior of terrorist organizations?' On this and other issues, Judaism has multiple perspectives, as was pointed out on X by Rabbi Josh Yuter, an Orthodox rabbi based in Israel. He weighed in on the debate over the memes by re-upping a four-year-old Twitter thread referring to a number of contradictory sources, from an admonition in Proverbs ('If your enemy falls, do not exult…') to a seeming endorsement in Psalms (​​'The righteous man will rejoice when he sees revenge…'). 'I remind everyone that conflicting perspectives regarding rejoicing over the downfall of one’s enemies are attested in rabbinic literature, with some sources being deliberately misinterpreted,' Yuter added on Wednesday. Sara Yael Hirschhorn, a historian who writes widely about Israel, put the operation and the reactions in the context of pro-Palestinian activists and human rights bodies that justify the attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah on Israeli civilians as 'resistance.' 'I don’t take glee in death, but if Western ‘morality’ has now decided that terrorists can kill Jews/Israelis as ‘resistance’ but not BE killed by state actors as internationally recognized terror organizations,' she tweeted, 'where are we as both an ethical universe and international system?!' #Hezbollah #pager memes please. pic.twitter.com/rdC9z9l1kA &mdash; Jacob Faturechi (@Jacobionite) September 17, 2024 The debate over rejoicing seemed to have cost at least one X user his job. Howard Feldman, who wrote about local politics for News24, a news service in South Africa, posted on the social media site Tuesday calling the attacks 'genius' and 'very cool' for their precision. He also joked, 'From the liver to the knee …' — a reference to the Palestinian nationalist slogan 'From the river to the sea.' A few hours later he posted a letter from News24’s editor in chief terminating his column and explaining, 'News 24 can in no way be associated with writers who glorify violence, which you did in my opinion.' Feldman responded: 'And just like that @News24 have shown me who they are…' Gallows humor is a core aspect of Israeli society and 'sick' jokes cropped up on Israeli social media even in the weeks after Oct. 7. On television, YouTube and social media, Israelis shared jokes about their own fears, what they saw as a propaganda war against Israel and Jews and the failures of their own government. And yet little of this humor was directly about the war in Gaza or the grim conditions on the ground there, noted Benji Lovitt, a Jerusalem-based comedian who has co-written a book about Zionism and Israeli culture. 'I didn’t see much humor about Gaza because it’s war, many people in Gaza have died and many, many are suffering,' he said. 'It doesn’t matter who you want to blame, but you don’t want to punch down and make fun of people in Gaza.' By contrast, he said, Hezbollah has been launching missile strikes on Israel for 11 months, and the electronics attacks are seen as surgically targeting its operatives and rebuking criticism that Israel’s bombing in Gaza has been indiscriminate. 'We are laughing because we believe it’s a clear example of punching up,' said Lovitt. 'And it’s an amazing story. I think people are laughing because they’re celebrating Israeli innovation. 'And it’s been a crappy year. People need to laugh.' The post The deadly pager operation in Lebanon is no laughing matter.

Trump calls Hezbollah beeper explosion operation ‘Amazing and sad...	Trump: 'That was a real operation; there's no doubt about it.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In an interview with NewsMax, former President and Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump praised the beeper detonation operation against Hezbollah and IRGC terrorists as 'amazing' while at the same time characterizing the attack as 'sad.' Like many others commenting on the event, Trump stressed the uniqueness of the operation and said, 'No one has ever seen anything like it. It is amazing. It's so sad in so many ways but amazing.' Trump added, 'Look, they're fighting to win. They're both fighting to win. No one has ever heard of or seen such a thing. That was a real operation; there's no doubt about it.' document.createElement('video'); During the Presidential debate with Democratic Candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump grilled Harris on the sincerity of her expressed support for Israel. He noted that she had skipped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhau’s July address to Congress – an event she was meant to preside over as vice-president. 'She hates Israel. She wouldn’t even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers,' Trump said of Harris. 'If she’s president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now, and I’ve been pretty good at predictions,' he said. Trump noted that less than a month before October 7th, the Biden administration chose to unfreeze billions of dollars in Iranian assets as part of a prisoner exchange deal. 'Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had,' Trump said. 'Iran had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different spheres of terror, and they are spheres of terror, horrible terror.' Iran was 'broke,' he continued. 'Now, they’re a rich nation, and now what they’re doing is they’re spreading the money around. Look at what’s happening with the Houthis and Yemen.' Trump said that the world is teetering on the edge of a devastating global conflict, and that lack of American leadership is exacerbating the danger.

Hostage families call on UNICEF to protect Israeli children capti...	We need international organizations, including UNICEF, to reach them there, in Gaza, to check on them, to take care of them,' said Tomer Keshet, a cousin of Yarden Bibas. By Sveta Listratov, TPS The families of Israeli hostages re'We need international organizations, including UNICEF, to reach them there, in Gaza, to check on them, to take care of them,' said Tomer Keshet, a cousin of Yarden Bibas.ached out to UNICEF in a bid to gain the release of two children still being held in Gaza. In a letter to Ted Chaiban, Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Professor Aron Troen, a public health expert and member of Israeli Association of Public Health Physicians, urged the agency to uphold its mandate of protecting children by advocating for the immediate release of child hostages. Among the 101 hostages being held by Hamas are five-year-old Ariel Bibas and one-year-old brother, Kfir, who were taken captive with their parents, Yarden and Shiri from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7. 'UNICEF’s raison d’être is to protect the welfare of children everywhere… Yet, they have been largely ineffectual and passive in protecting the human rights of Israeli children,' Troen told The Press Service of Israel. He stressed that three million Israeli children are suffering from the effects of the ongoing conflict, many of whom are displaced, living under the constant threat of rocket attacks, or dealing with trauma. Tomer Keshet, a cousin of Yarden Bibas, recounted to TPS-IL a meeting with UNICEF representatives, including Director Catherine Russell, in Jerusalem on April 15. 'We told her in detail about the day they were kidnapped, about the family, the kids. We want them not to be just numbers on a list, but real people,' Keshet recalled. 'Ariel looks shy but has the energy of a red-haired kid. And Kfir was so tiny when we last saw him, and by now he has spent more time in captivity than living as a free man.' Russell tweeted of that meeting that the families 'shared devastating accounts of captivity, loss & heartbreak,' adding 'All the hostages must be released immediately.' The tweet, Keshet told TPS-IL, was 'a step in the right direction, but it’s not enough.' 'We need international organizations, including UNICEF, to reach them there, in Gaza, to check on them, to take care of them. The kids cannot spend almost a year in a tunnel. They cannot.' The Bibas children were last seen in a video filmed by Hamas showing Shiri Bibas holding Ariel and Kfir in her arms covered by a blanket and surrounded by armed terrorists. In late November, 110 Israelis and foreign nationals were released as part of a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas, including 37 Israelis who were 18 or younger. While most of the women and children were freed, Shiri, Ariel and Kfir were not among those returned. Hamas claimed the Bibas children and their mother were dead but never provided evidence. After the hostages were freed, Israel denounced Hamas for branding brothers Yigal and Or Yaakov, ages 12 and 16 respectively, with a motorcycle exhaust pipe to prevent their escape, and drugging the children when moving hostages from one location to another. Troen’s letter criticized The International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations for not visiting Israeli child hostages even once to ascertain their conditions, noting, 'This appalling failure to address their fundamental human rights and health needs has had disastrous consequences.' The letter also raised the situation of other Israeli children who lost their parents. For example, Troen’s nephew, 16-year-old Rotem Mathias, was shot during Hamas’s attack on Kibbutz Holit on October 7. While Rotem survived, his parents did not. Troen also denounced UNICEF’s imbalanced criticism of Israel. 'We frequently see statements and reports regarding the suffering of civilians and children in Gaza, but we don’t see the same urgency for the hostages or the three million children in Israel enduring this protracted war,' he told TPS-IL. This imbalance, Troen said, has created 'a profound sense of neglect and frustration in Israel.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

US officials admit that Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal unlikely ...	No deal is imminent,' one of the U.S. officials said. 'I’m not sure it ever gets done.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Despite making hopeful remarks about an imminent hostage deal and ceasefire in Gaza for weeks, US officials are finally admitting privately that such an agreement is unlikely before US President Joe Biden leaves office, the Wall Street Journal reports. At the same time, US officials said they would continue to pursue a peace agreement to avoid an escalation of tensions that could spread beyond the region. Although US officials acknowledge that they could encourage the warring parties on '90 percent' of the agreement, several sticking points between Hamas and Israel prevent a deal from proceeding. 'No deal is imminent,' one of the U.S. officials said. 'I’m not sure it ever gets done.' Top-level officials in the White House, State Department, and Pentagon cited the number of type of Palestinian prisoners Hamas wants to be released in exchange for hostages and Israel's desire to maintain control of the Philadelphi corridor on the border between Gaza and Egypt as two main reasons for the impasse. Many officials are frustrated with Hamas's intransigence and habit of making more demands without then saying 'yes' even when the demands are fulfilled. These officials have wondered if Hamas wants a deal or is pretending to negotiate to bolster its image. Other officials are impatient with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence that Israel maintain control of the Philadelphi corridor. 'There’s no chance now of it happening,' an official from an Arab country said.'Everyone is in a wait-and-see mode until after the election. The outcome will determine what can happen in the next administration.' John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, told reporters Wednesday that chances of a deal were 'daunting.' Although there were times an agreement seemed imminent, 'we aren’t any closer to that now than we were even a week ago.' Biden administration officials are dismayed that the absence of a hostage release deal and ceasefire agreement by the time the President leaves office could leave a stain on his legacy.

‘Uncommitted’ group won’t endorse Kamala Harris, Muslim voters al...	Recent polling suggests that Muslim American voters are increasingly flirting with the possibility of casting a ballot for Green Party candidate Jill Stein over Harris. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner A prominent anti-Israel political group announced that it will not endorse Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 US election despite Harris’s extensive outreach to the Arab American community. In a statement released on Thursday, the 'Uncommitted National Movement' criticized the Harris campaign for not agreeing to meet with Palestinian American families to discuss the possibility of implementing an arms blockade on Israel and a permanent ceasefire in Gaza if elected to office in November. The group claimed that its decision not to issue an endorsement of Harris came after months of pleading with the Democratic nominee and current US vice president to adopt anti-Israel positions on her policy platform. 'For months, we have urged Vice President Harris to shift her Gaza policy so we could mobilize voters in key states to save lives and our democracy,' the group wrote. The group also griped about the Democratic National Convention’s (DNC) refusal in August to allow a Palestinian American to speak from the event main stage. 'The DNC and the vice president’s campaign fumbled even a small gesture to unite our party ahead of November by rejecting the simple request for a Palestinian American speaker. Now, the vice president’s campaign is courting Dick Cheney while sidelining disillusioned anti-war voices,' Uncommitted wrote. Despite refusing to throw its support behind the Democratic nominee, the group also warned about the dangers of electing former US President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican nominee, back into the White House, suggesting that he will intensify the so-called 'genocide' against Palestinians in Gaza. The organization also asserted that Trump will persecute 'pro-Palestinian activism in the US.' The movement also urged its supporters to refrain from voting for a third party candidate, arguing that it would assist Trump in his quest to regain the Oval Office. 'We must block Donald Trump, which is why we urge Uncommitted voters to vote against him and avoid third-party candidates that could inadvertently boost his chances, as Trump openly boasts that third parties will help his candidacy,' the group wrote. The Uncommitted movement’s decision to formally withhold support from Harris came on the heels of US Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), the only Palestinian American woman in Congress, publicly refusing to endorse the Democratic nominee while speaking to a crowd at the Congressional Black Caucus annual convention last week. During the event, Tlaib claimed that her constituents 'don’t want blood on my hands' and believe Harris will continue the policies that have allowed the war in Gaza to persist. Recent polling suggests that Muslim American voters are increasingly flirting with the possibility of casting a ballot for Green Party candidate Jill Stein over Harris, in part due to frustration over US policy toward Israel and Gaza. A new poll from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) revealed that 40 percent of Muslim voters in Michigan plan on voting for Stein. Harris trailed Trump with Muslim voters in Michigan, 18 percent to 12 percent, the poll found. Stein, a far-left political figure, has aggressively courted the Arab American vote since launching her campaign. During public appearances, she frequently dons the keffiyeh — a traditional Arab headdress that, since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October, has become a sign of support for the Palestinian cause — and refers to the conflict as a 'genocide.' Stein has also claimed that Hamas’s Oct. 7 slaughter of 1,200 people throughout southern Israel was justified as an act of so-called 'self defense.' In lieu of supporting a candidate for the upcoming presidential election, the Uncommitted movement encouraged the public to engage in 'anti-war organizing.' The refusal of the prominent pro-Palestinian group to endorse Harris was the latest blow to the Democratic nominee’s efforts to court Arab American voters. On Tuesday, the Harris campaign unveiled a set of new digital ads targeting the heavily Arab American city of Dearborn, Michigan. The ads included clips of Harris expressing sympathy for civilians in Gaza and vowing to 'not be silent.' The DNC, where Harris officially became the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, hosted a panel on 'Palestinian Human Rights' for the first time in history, in which activists accused Israel of committing a 'genocide' in Hamas-ruled Gaza. Though Harris has voiced support for the Jewish state’s right to existence and self defense, she has also expressed sympathy for far-left narratives that brand Israel as 'genocidal.' The vice president has additionally often criticized Israel’s war effort against the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in Gaza.

US warplanes, ships and troops ready in the Middle East if the co...	Here’s a look at the U.S. military presence in the Middle East. By The Associated Press The U.S. has kept an increased military presence in the Middle East throughout much of the past year, with about 40,000 forces, at least a dozen warships, and four Air Force fighter jet squadrons spread across the region both to protect allies and to serve as a deterrent against attacks, several U.S. officials said. As attacks between Israel and Hezbollah sharply spiked this week, worries are growing that the conflict could escalate into an all-out war, even as Jerusalem keeps up its nearly yearlong fight against Hamas terrorists in Gaza. Hezbollah says Israel crossed a 'red line' with explosive attacks on its communications devices and vowed to keep up the missile strikes it’s launched since fellow Iranian-backed terrorist group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, setting off the war in Gaza. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant — who has spoken repeatedly this week to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin — has declared the start of a 'new phase' of the war, shifting its focus to the northern front against Hezbollah in Lebanon. So far, the U.S. hasn’t signaled a troop increase or change as a result of the latest attacks, and there is already a beefed-up force in the region. 'We’re confident in the ability that we have there right now to protect our forces and should we need to come to the defense of Israel as well,' Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Thursday. A military official said the additional resources have helped as the U.S. patrols various conflict areas, including operations targeting the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, defending Israel and countering threats from Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have targeted commercial ships in the Red Sea and launched ballistic missiles at Israel. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to describe U.S. troop movements and locations. Here’s a look at the U.S. military presence in the Middle East: Troops Normally, about 34,000 U.S. forces are deployed to U.S. Central Command, which covers the entire Middle East. That troop level grew in the early months of the Israel-Hamas war to about 40,000 as additional ships and aircraft were sent in. Several weeks ago, the total spiked to nearly 50,000 when Austin ordered two aircraft carriers and their accompanying warships to stay in the region as tensions roiled between Israel and Lebanon. One carrier strike group has since left and moved into the Asia-Pacific. The beefed-up presence is designed both to help defend Israel and protect U.S. and allied personnel and assets. Navy warships are scattered across the region, from the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Oman, and both Air Force and Navy fighter jets are strategically based at several locations to be better prepared to respond to any attacks. Warships The U.S. is back to one aircraft carrier in the region. Austin has extended the deployment of carriers several times in the past year so that on a few occasions, there has been the rare presence of two at once. American military commanders have long argued that the presence of a formidable aircraft carrier — with its array of fighter jets and surveillance aircraft and sophisticated missiles — is a strong deterrent against Iran. The USS Abraham Lincoln and its three destroyers are in the Gulf of Oman, while two U.S. Navy destroyers are in the Red Sea. The USS Georgia guided missile submarine, which Austin ordered to the region last month, had been in the Red Sea and remains in U.S. Central Command, but officials declined to say where. There are six U.S. warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, including the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard. And three Navy destroyers are in that area. About a half dozen of the F/A-18 fighter jets from the USS Abraham Lincoln have been moved to a land base in the region. Officials declined to say where. Aircraft The Air Force sent in an additional squadron of advanced F-22 fighter jets last month, bringing the total number of land-based fighter squadrons in the Middle East to four. That force also includes a squadron of A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft, F-15E Strike Eagles and F-16 fighter jets. The Air Force is not identifying what countries the planes are operating from. The addition of the F-22 fighter jets gives U.S. forces a hard-to-detect aircraft that has a sophisticated suite of sensors to suppress enemy air defenses and carry out electronic attacks. The F-22 also can act as a 'quarterback,' organizing other warplanes in an operation. But the U.S. also showed in February that it doesn’t have to have planes based in the Middle East to attack targets. In February, a pair of B-1 bombers took off from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas and flew more than 30 hours in a roundtrip mission in which they struck 85 Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force targets in Iraq and Syria in response to an attack by IRGC-backed militias that killed three U.S. service members.

Trump holds 10-point lead over Harris with New York Jews, poll fi...	The poll indicates that some Jewish voters could be fleeing the Democratic Party over frustrations stemming from Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war and surging antisemitism. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds a commanding lead over her Democratic opponent Kamala Harris among New York Jewish voters in the 2024 election, according to the latest Siena College poll. The poll found that Jewish New Yorkers prefer Trump, who previously served as the 45th US president, over Harris, the current vice president, by a margin of 54 percent to 44 percent when including third-party candidates. If the US presidential election were held today and it was just a two-person race, the figures would only change slightly, with Trump beating Harris among Jewish voters in the Empire State by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent. Conducted from Sept. 11-16, the findings suggest that Trump has made significant inroads with the Jewish community. Additional polling data from Siena indicates that Jewish voters are rapidly warming up to Trump as Election Day in the US inches closer. Trump led Harris 50 percent to 49 percent among Jewish New York voters in August, according to Siena College. In June, Jewish voters preferred then-presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden over Trump 52 percent to 46 percent. Trump’s favorability among Jewish voters has also significantly increased in recent months, according to the polling data. In July, 44 percent of Jewish voters indicated a 'favorable' view of Trump and 52 percent indicated an 'unfavorable' view of the former president. That number has surged since then, with 52 percent of Jewish voters revealing a 'favorable' view of Trump and 48 percent revealing an 'unfavorable' view of the Republican nominee in the latest poll. The poll represents the latest indication that at least some Jewish voters could be fleeing the Democratic Party, potentially over frustrations stemming from the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war and surging antisemitism within traditionally-liberal institutions. The data also indicates that Harris possesses notably weaker support among New York Jews than Biden, potentially suggesting dissatisfaction over the vice president’s positions on Israel or a lack of trust that she will forcefully defend the Jewish state’s interests. Trump has made numerous overtures to the Jewish community in recent months, attempting to win over a significant share of the traditionally-liberal voting bloc. He has delivered speeches at various events catered toward the Jewish community, including the Republican Jewish Coalition. The former president also co-hosted an event focusing on antisemitism at his Trump National Golf Club Bedminster alongside prominent Jewish donor Miriam Adelson. The former president has touted his former administration’s support for Israel as a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign. During his single term in office, Trump recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a strategic region on Israel’s northern border previously controlled by Syria. He also moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, recognizing the city as the Jewish state’s capital. The Trump administration also helped to broker the Abraham Accords, which normalized Israel’s relations with four Arab countries in 2020. Evidence of Trump’s success in wooing Jewish voters has been replicated by other polls. A July survey conducted by pollster Richard Baris showed that Jewish voters nationally prefer Harris over Trump by a margin of 52.7 percent to 45.9 percent. However, a poll commissioned by the Jewish Democratic Council of America released earlier this month found that 72 percent of Jewish Americans plan on casting a ballot for Harris and 25 percent are poised to do the same for Trump.

Austin: US support for Israel ‘unwavering’ amid Iran threats	Gallant said that he discussed with Austin the 'strategic, regional picture,' and briefed the Pentagon chief 'on IDF operations in the southern and northern arenas, focusing on Israel’s defense against Hezbollah threats. By JNS U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke overnight Wednesday with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant to review regional security developments. Austin 'reiterated unwavering U.S. support for Israel in the face of threats from Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah, and Iran’s other regional partners,' and 'emphasized the U.S. commitment to deterring regional adversaries and efforts to de-escalate tensions across the region,' according to a readout provided by Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder. The secretary also 'reaffirmed the priority of achieving a Gaza ceasefire deal that will bring home hostages held by Hamas, and an enduring diplomatic resolution to the conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border that will allow civilians on both sides to return to their homes.' Gallant said that he discussed with Austin the 'strategic, regional picture,' and briefed the Pentagon chief 'on IDF operations in the southern and northern arenas, focusing on Israel’s defense against Hezbollah threats. 'I expressed my appreciation to the Secretary for his unwavering commitment to Israel’s security and contribution to the U.S.-Israel alliance,' the minister said. During a telephone conversation on Monday, Gallant told Austin that time was running out for an agreed-upon de-escalation with Hezbollah. 'The possibility of a settlement in the north is passing. Hezbollah continues to tie itself to Hamas. The direction is clear,' said Gallant. On Thursday morning, eight people were wounded when two anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon struck the Ramim Ridge area of Israel’s Upper Galilee. On Wednesday, in the second wave of such incidents, communications devices used by Hezbollah terrorists exploded across the group’s stronghold in Beirut and in Southern Lebanon. According to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, at least 20 Hezbollah operatives were killed and some 450 were wounded. On Tuesday, more than 2,700 Hezbollah members were wounded and at least 12 were killed across Lebanon when their pagers exploded, with the terrorist organization saying it held Israel 'fully responsible.' Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Defense Minister Gallant says he is ‘unfamiliar’ with ‘one-shot’ ...	IDF official Nitzan Alon said Gal Hirsch, who presented the deal to US officials, 'was never a part of the negotiating team.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Maj.-Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon, the IDF official overseeing the issue of captives said they were not familiar with the 'one-shot' deal that negotiator Gal Hirsch reportedly submitted to US officials. Although Hirsch has been described as a negotiator on behalf of the hostages, Alon said he was 'never a part of the negotiating team.' Alon told N12, 'The proposal that Gal Hirsch submitted to the US is not known to the negotiating team; Hirsch was never part of the negotiating team.' Gallant said he was also unfamiliar with the plan. KAN News reported earlier Thursday that Israeli officials had met with their US counterparts and had agreed to a framework that would see the release of all the hostages at once, an immediate cessation of hostilities in Gaza, and a safe exit for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his deputies. The proposal also includes the release of dangerous Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody, the demilitarization of Gaza, and the establishment of a new governance system for the region. However, the specifics of these components remain undisclosed. An Israeli official told KAN, 'Due to difficulties in negotiations and the ticking clock regarding the abductees' lives, we wish to propose a 'secondary plan' that would shorten the stages and allow for a faster agreement. This will happen if Sinwar leaves and ends the war. It will also help us achieve the goals of the war while enabling the Hamas leadership in Gaza to leave safely.' However, the new information that Alon and Gallant were unfamiliar with and not connected with the plan was met with disappointment and outrage from the Hostage and Missing Persons Families Forum, and they called out Gal Hirsch for falsely raising expectations that the plan was approved and going forward. 'Gal Hirsch has once again chosen to carry out a cynical, cheap, and disgraceful manipulation at the expense of the hostages, their families, and the people of Israel. This is a deception aimed at thwarting the new American initiative for the release of the hostages and ending the war in Gaza.' The Hostage and Missing Persons Families Forum also blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for the lack of a deal and accused him of 'abandoning the hostages.'

Hezbollah leader admits Israel dealt ‘a heavy blow’ with beeper e...	Nasrallah: 'We undoubtedly suffered a major security and humanitarian blow, unprecedented in the conflict and maybe in the history of mankind.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah admitted that the explosion of beepers that killed dozens and wounded thousands of terrorists was a 'major blow.' He said, 'We undoubtedly suffered a major security and humanitarian blow, unprecedented in the conflict and maybe in the history of mankind.' Nasrallah added, 'We were hit hard, but that's the situation in war. We understand that the enemy has technological supremacy. Especially since it is supported by the US and the West.' Israel has not taken responsibility for the pager explosions, and the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden Administration had no involvement in the attacks. He continued, 'When we are in conflict, we bet on Jihad, on attrition. We had many victories until now.' Nasrallah added that he is determined that Hezbollah 'won't be knocked down' by the the beeper explosions. 'We will be ready to overcome all of the threats and attempts in the future,' he said. The terror leader said that the pager explosions, 'crossed a red line' and was tantamount to a 'declaration of war.' 'Israel crossed all the red lines by detonating thousands of pagers. This could be called a declaration of war,' he said. Although the pagers were in the hands of terrorists, Nasrallah claimed that the explosions caused substantial civilian casualties, including women and children, claims which have not been substantiated. 'The devices exploded in unison in the hospitals as well. As a result of the aggression, dozens were killed, including women and children, and thousands were injured. The true numbers will come with time,' he said. 'This is an act of terror, massacre, genocide,' Nasrallah said. However, in his next sentence, Nasrallah admitted the pagers belonged to terrorists and not civilians and explained, 'More than 4,000 pagers were distributed to the organization's operatives.' Nasrallah threatened Israel that residents of the north would not be able to return to their homes and that Hezbollah would continue their attacks in the region. 'We tell Netanyahu, Gallant (the Defense Minister), and the Israeli military - you won't succeed in returning the residents of the north to the north, do what you want, you won't succeed.' Since October 8th, 2023, Hezbollah has fired missiles almost daily into the north, and 60,000 residents have been evacuated. Nasrallah said the only thing that will stop the terror group from attacking northern Israel is a ceasefire in Gaza. 'The only way is to stop the aggression and the war against the people of Gaza and the West Bank, without that there's nothing. Not an escalation, not eliminations, and not a full war,' he said.

Security expert reveals how Iran recruits Israeli agents	Maman knew that the discussions’ goal was to 'advance assassination attacks' on Israeli officials, the Shin Bet said. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following the arrest on Thursday of 73-year-old Israeli Moti Maman from Ashkelon on charges of spying against Israel for Iran, security officials reveal how terror states like Iran recruit Israelis, sometimes unwittingly, sometimes with full awareness of the crime. Maman was detained in a joint operation between the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and the Israel Police's Lahav 433 National Crime Unit. The businessman, who spent a significant amount of time in Turkey, became acquainted with Iranian agents who recruited him to carry out surveillance activities, such as photographing public places in Israel. Maman knew that the discussions’ goal was to 'advance assassination attacks' on Israeli officials, the Shin Bet said. Iranian officials also asked the Israeli if he could help recruit assassins to kill Iranian dissidents living in exile in the West. Maman demanded an advance payment of one million dollars before carrying out any missions on behalf of Iran. That request was denied, but the Iranians compensated Maman for participating in the meetings with 5,000 euros. Maariv spoke to Lior Ackerman, Head of National Resilience at the Institute for Policy and Strategy at Reichman University and Chairman of the New People's Council, about how Iran and terrorist organizations recruit Israelis. 'Iran's efforts at recruiting Israeli agents and instructing them to operate within Israel are not new. For years, Shin Bet has foiled numerous plots, thwarted incidents, and made arrests. Shin Bet succeeded on many occasions in stopping the incidents before they caused damage.' In many cases, the Israelis targeted are unaware of the motives of the people they meet online, and Iran often tries to contact vulnerable people through fake profiles on social media. 'The Iranians frequently operate through social media and use fake profiles. They have often recruited Israelis who were naive to gather information for them.' However, Maman's current case doesn't appear to be an example of Iran recruiting an unwitting agent through social media. 'This case is unusual because it involves locating a specific Israeli and recruiting him to assist in carrying out actual attacks within Israel in exchange for money. ' 'He was even taken to meetings in Iran. Clearly, this is not a case of an innocent citizen who didn't know what he was doing.'

‘We need to bring another blow’: Northern Israeli residents react...	Northern residents were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. By Anna Epshtein, TPS In the lobby of the Jerusalem Royal Hotel, despair mixed with hope for evacuated residents of the northern community of Shlomi as they watched news reports of Hezbollah’s exploding communication devices on Wednesday. They hope that the 'pager attack,' as they referred to it, is the beginning of a new phase of war with Hezbollah they have been calling for so they can safely return to their homes, they told The Press Service of Israel. Thousands of Hezbollah operatives were injured when their pagers and walkie-talkies blew up on Tuesday and Wednesday. Hezbollah said 32 of its people were killed, a number that has not been independently verified. 'It was good to hear,' Inbar Ben Arush, a manicurist and a mother of two, tells TPS-IL. 'And don’t get me wrong, I am not happy about the war. I was a leftist before October 7, but my conceptions have changed. We don’t have a partner for peace there. We tried for almost a year to find some diplomatic solution. And we know too well that without a serious army operation in Lebanon, we won’t be able to get back home,' she adds while setting up a table for a manicure. Sitting nearby with her knitting, Mazal Hakim asks, 'How long can you live in a hotel? It’s good for three days, maybe a week. We have been here for almost a year. We broke here, became sick. Almost all of the grown-ups.' At another table, Braina Wasserman plays a card game with her teenage granddaughter. The game is called 'touch' and it’s not clear who is winning. Braina tells TPS-IL she has been playing this for hours with the kids from Shlomi because 'It helps the time pass.' As a boy aimlessly walks his bicycle back and forth near the table, Braina tells TPS-IL, 'It’s not nice to be happy about somebody’s death, but I was happy. For what they did to us, they do not deserve mercy.' Braina does not believe the 'pager attack' will get her home any time soon. 'I know I’ll be here for the holidays, and maybe for another year, too,' she says. Rosh HaShanah, the Jewish new year, begins on October 2 at sundown. Meir Navon, a retired naval officer, is on the phone trying to obtain a shofar, a ram’s horn traditionally blown during the High Holidays. Evacuees pray in an improvised synagogue in the lobby. 'After this attack, the enemy is on the floor, and we can’t let him stand up again. We need to bring another blow, and then another one, until he is destroyed,' Navon told TPS-IL. 'I was disappointed that after the attack Israel did not start a ground operation in Lebanon immediately. We are too merciful,' he adds. Meir’s friend, Mahluf Tubul nods in agreement. One of the founders of Shlomi in the 1950s, Tubul remarks, 'If Israel does not enter the war in the north, we will lose it.' On Monday, the Security Cabinet updated its official war goals to include the secure return of 60,000 evacuated northern residents to their homes. Northern residents were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. Hezbollah leaders have said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. The attacks have so far killed 26 civilians and 20 soldiers on the Israeli side. According to figures released by the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) Hezbollah fired 1,307 rockets at northern Israel in August, an average of 40 rockets daily. Since October 8, Hezbollah has launched more than 6,700 rockets and drones. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War. Israel’s three other official war goals are the eradication of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities, the return of all hostages, and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Report: Israel proposes ‘one-shot’ deal to end Gaza war	In a statement, The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government to publicly endorse the plan.

By World Israel News Staff Two people were injured in a drone strike on northern Israel Thursday afternoon, hours a series of missile attacks left at least eight people injured. The drone attack was carried out by Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon, and struck Ya'ara, a moshav in the northwestern Galilee near the Lebanese frontier. A separate drone strike was reported near the northeastern Galilee town of Beit Hillel, sparking a blaze outside of the moshav. 'A short while ago, a UAV was identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory and falling adjacent to Beit Hillel,' an IDF spokesperson said Thursday afternoon. 'Israel Fire and Rescue Services are currently operating to extinguish a fire that erupted as a result of the fragments. No injuries were reported. No fragments were identified falling inside the area of the community.' 'Additionally, an explosive UAV was identified falling adjacent to the community of Ya'ara. No fragments were identified falling in the area of the community.' The drone strikes come just hours after a pair of missile attacks by Hezbollah terrorists on northern Israel left eight people injured. Two anti-tank missiles were fired from southern Lebanon Thursday morning, hitting the Ramim Ridge of the Upper Galilee. Of the eight victims injured in the attacks, two are listed in moderate-to-serious condition. The IDF responded to the missile attacks with artillery fire aimed at the launch site. The Israeli Air Force overnight Wednesday struck Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in seven areas of Southern Lebanon, the military said on Thursday morning. Buildings used by the Iranian terrorist proxy were hit in the areas of Chihine, Taybeh, Blida, Meiss, El Jabal, Aitaroun and Kfarkela. In addition, a Hezbollah weapons storage facility was struck in the area of Khiam.

‘No blood money’ – Norwegian soccer player snubs Israeli team, ci...	Norwegian striker for Rosenborg soccer club rebuffs nearly one million dollars offered by Maccabi Haifa, rejecting 'blood money' to play for Israeli team. By World Israel News Staff A Norwegian soccer player turned down an offer by an Israeli soccer club, citing the ongoing war between Israel and the Hamas terror organization, accusing the soccer team of offering him 'blood money.' Maccabi Haifa, based in northern Israel, had sought to sign 28-year-old Trondheim-native Ole Christian Hammerfjell Sæter, currently a player with the Rosenborg Ballklub soccer team. Hoping to secure Sæter on their roster prior to the end of the Israeli Premier League's transfer window, Maccabi Haifa offered 850,000 Euros ($950,000) to Rosenborg to sign the forward. On Wednesday, however, Sæter publicly ruled out the possibility of joining Maccabi Haifa - or any other Israeli team - saying that playing with an Israeli soccer club violated his 'values,' referencing the ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas and castigating the IDF's policies in the coastal enclave. 'I will not represent a country that perpetuates insecurity and evil with the killing of innocent people,' Sæter said. 'No amount of money can buy my values. I choose humanity over blood money. Even if I were offered billions, I wouldn’t move there.' 'I am confident in my values and happy to stand by what I believe is right. I don’t want such money in my account. There are people there who can’t live safely in their own homes. It’s quite insane. There’s no way I will represent a country that acts like that.' In 2023, Sæter, who is one quarter Pakistani by heritage, hinted that he might consider playing on Pakistan's national soccer team, uploading an image of himself wearing a Pakistani jersey to X.

Mossad established fake electronics company to plant bombs in Hez...	Hungarian electronics company which licensed out Taiwanese brand was reportedly established by Israeli operatives for the Mossad operation against Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff The company responsible for manufacturing the pagers involved in the wave of explosions targeting Hezbollah terrorists in Syria and Lebanon was established by Israeli operatives as part of the Mossad operation to target the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group, The New York Times reported Wednesday. Thousands of Hezbollah members were wounded and at least 32 killed in a pair of bombing attacks Tuesday and Wednesday, in which thousands of pagers and hand-held radios simultaneously detonated across Lebanon and Syria, apparently the result of Israeli sabotage. Hezbollah had ordered the devices as part of its plan to evade Israeli tracking through modern cellular devices. It appears, however, that the pagers ordered by Hezbollah and distributed to its members were in fact supplied by a shell company which had been established by Israel's Mossad, according to the Times report. The pagers in question, AR-924 model devices bearing the Gold Apollo brand, were manufactured by an outside party which had licensed the Taiwan-based company's brand. On Wednesday, Gold Apollo founder and president Hsu Ching-Kuang told reporters that the Hungarian company BAC was responsible for the pagers' manufacture. 'The product was not ours. It was only that it had our brand on it,' Hsu said. 'We may not be a large company, but we are a responsible one,' the Gold Apollo president said, expressing surprise that the pagers could be rigged with explosives and detonated. 'This is very embarrassing.' Hsu added that BAC’s payments to Gold Apollo for use of its license were 'very strange,' saying the payments originated in the Middle East. According to the Times report, as Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah became increasingly concerned by Israel's ability to track the movement Hezbollah terrorists and sought alternative communications methods, Israeli security intelligence officers began making preparations for the operation which culminated in the attacks Tuesday and Wednesday. At least three separate shell companies were established for the purposes of the operation, three intelligence officials said, adding that BAC served a number of customers in order to establish and maintain its cover, manufacturing 'a range of ordinary pagers.' While the first pagers were delivered to Hezbollah in the summer of 2022, production was accelerated dramatically in February, which thousands of devices delivered this summer.

‘You dared to strike at Israel, now they’ve sent you back 1,000 y...	United Arab Emirates strategic analyst blasts Iranian-backed terror groups, mocks Hezbollah after it suffered two waves of bombing attacks. By World Israel News Staff A journalist and strategic analyst focusing on Middle Eastern affairs from the United Arab Emirates took aim at Iranian-backed anti-Israel terrorist groups Wednesday, castigating them for the attacks on Israel on October 7th, and mocking Hezbollah after a pair of apparent Israeli attacks left thousands of terrorists injured. Amjad Taha, author of The Deception of the Arab Spring, excoriated Hamas and Hezbollah in a tweet Wednesday night, while cheering a pair of attacks - widely attributed to Israel - targeting Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon and Syria. 'You dared to strike at a smart and courageous nation on October 7th—committing genocide, kidnapping their children, and violating their women,' Taha wrote. 'You thought they would fall, but they rose again, returning after 11 months to correct what had only momentarily slipped—their intelligence. Now, they will send you back 1,000 years, to a time without technology, where a ringtone feels like a death knell and a beep is a nightmare.' Taha praised Israel for accomplishing what he dubbed a 'victory' for 'all who stand against terror.' 'You will be haunted by your own shadow, too afraid to use any technology, cut off from the advanced world. And they will defeat you—not with bullets or tanks, but through the unbreakable will of brave, intelligent people.' 'Over a simple cup of coffee, with one decisive click, they will seal your fate, and the fate of anyone who dares harm their children. This is a nation the world respects. Lebanon—Hezbollah's pager attacks and today's V82 strike are not merely military victories; they represent a triumph for the Middle East over radicalism—a victory not only for Israel but for all who stand against terror.' In another tweet Wednesday, Taha castigated Hezbollah for its involvement during the Syrian civil war, celebrating Israel's targeted attacks on Hezbollah operatives - detonating pagers and hand-held radios on Tuesday and Wednesday. 'Once again, Israel's remarkable fireworks light up Lebanon, as Hezbollah members gather to bury their 'pagers 1' victims—only for 'Pager 2' to begin, burying the burriers.' 'Today, new communication systems, vehicles, and locations tied to Hezbollah—the same group responsible for slaughtering innocent babies, raping women, and committing genocide in Syria—are targeted.' 'This terrorist organization, which has displaced millions of Muslims, Arabs, Jews, and Christians from northern Israel by attacking hospitals and schools, is being systematically dismantled. Many admire Israel's effective methods in eliminating these savage terrorist animals in Lebanon.' A long-time critic of Hezbollah, in June, Taha compared the terrorist group to Nazi Germany. Hezbollah, Taha said, is 'not different than the Nazis.'

Israel proposes alternative hostage deal with Hamas	Details include all hostages to be released at once in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, Hamas leaders to be exiled, and a multinational force to oversee the ‘day after.’ By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel has sent the United States a new deal it is willing to conclude with Hamas that would free the hostages and end the war all in a single phase, Israel's Hebrew-language press reported Thursday. The main sticking points in the current proposal revolve around its three stages. Israel fears that Hamas would backtrack after releasing only the first group of hostages, and has refused the terrorist group's demand for the IDF to leave the Philadelphi Corridor, a critical security zone. In the new deal, all the hostages would be released at once and an as-yet unknown number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails would be freed. In addition, safe passage to a third country will be guaranteed for Hamas head Yahya Sinwar, which he had recently insisted be part of a deal, and for all terrorists who want to leave Gaza, which could number in the thousands. The process of demilitarization, meaning the destruction of Hamas huge arsenal of weapons, would commence immediately upon their departure and the concomitant withdrawal of Israeli military forces from the Strip. A multinational force would oversee Gaza’s disarmament and, eventually, its reconstruction. The supervising countries were not identified by name. There are reportedly several options, such as a combination of American and Sunni Arab states. If the deal is not executed within the listed time frame, the proposal states that the IDF will be allowed to return and recommence the war. The government’s coordinator on the hostage issue, Gen. (res.) Gal Hirsch, has already presented the plan to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which reacted positively to the idea. 'We welcome [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu's new outline: a one-shot deal and the end of the fighting,' the Forum said in a statement. 'A one-shot deal that includes all 101 abductees is the wish of all Israeli citizens in general and the families of the abductees in particular&#8230;. The prime minister must lead with courage, determination and speed the proposal he formulated.' Several families of male civilian and soldier hostages, who were to be released only in the second stage of the current plan, had opposed it because they feared that Hamas would renege after the first stage and murder those who were still left in their hands. According to Kan News, hostage families are demanding that the prime minister give voice to his new proposal at the opening of the UN General Assembly next week, which he is scheduled to address on September 26.

Teamsters buck Kamala as Harris becomes first Democratic presiden...	The Teamsters, one of the country's largest unions, has historically supported Democratic candidates for president. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon Vice President Kamala Harris became the first Democratic presidential nominee not to receive the Teamsters endorsement in nearly 30 years, with the union declining to back a candidate after a strong majority of its rank-and-file members voted to endorse former president Donald Trump. The union made the announcement Wednesday, saying its 'extensive member polling showed no majority support for Vice President Harris and no universal support among the membership for President Trump.' Just one hour earlier, however, it released that polling, which found that 59.6 percent of Teamsters voted to endorse Trump, compared with 34 percent who backed Harris. The poll was conducted following the Republican and Democratic conventions. Its results were confirmed by a second poll that ran from Sept. 9 to Sept. 15, in which members again backed Trump over Harris, 58 percent to 31 percent. The Teamsters, one of the country's largest unions, has historically supported Democratic candidates for president. The lack of endorsement makes Harris the first Democratic presidential candidate not to receive the union's backing since 1996, when the union declined to endorse candidates Bill Clinton and Robert Dole. Before then, they last declined to endorse a Democrat in 1988. In a Wednesday afternoon press release, Teamsters president Sean O'Brien said the union's polling showed 'no majority support for Vice President Harris and no universal support among the membership for President Trump,' suggesting the union applied different standards to the two candidates. 'We strongly encourage all our members to vote in the upcoming election, and to remain engaged in the political process,' O'Brien said. 'But this year, no candidate for President has earned the endorsement of the Teamsters’ International Union.' When releasing the membership polling, O’Brien said the Teamsters’s 2024 endorsement would be 'the most inclusive, democratic, and transparent Presidential endorsement process in the history of our 121-year-old organization.' Before President Joe Biden’s exit from the campaign, polling data from April 9 to July 3 indicated that union members preferred Biden at 44.3 percent, while Trump garnered 36.3 percent.

Khamenei reaffirms Iran’s ban on competing against Israeli athlet...	Last year, Iran’s Weightlifting Federation imposed a lifetime ban on Iranian professional weightlifter Mostafa Rajaei for shaking hands with an Israeli athlete. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei restated the country’s long-established ban on competing against Israelis while on Tuesday addressing Iranian athletes who competed in the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic competitions in Paris. Khamenei also called on Iranian officials to compensate athletes who withdraw from matches to avoid facing an opponent from Israel, Iran International reported. He said Iranian athletes are making a 'sacrifice' by pulling out of competitions against Israelis because of their national and religious beliefs, and they need to be recognized and supported by Iranian officials, according to the Tehran Times. The Iranian leader further accused the governing body of the Olympics and Paralympics of displaying a 'double standard' by banning Russia from both international competitions, because of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, while allowing Israel to still compete despite the raging war between the Jewish state and the Hamas terrorist organization that orchestrated the Oct. 7 deadly terrorist attacks across southern Israel. The Iranian regime backs Hamas and has for years provided the terrorist organization with arms, funding, and training. Khamenei then accused Israel of killing 41,000 people in the Gaza Strip, a death toll announced by the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health that cannot be independently verified and does not distinguish between civilians and terrorists. Even the United Nations, a vocal critic of Israel’s war effort, has cited erroneous figures in the health ministry’s reported deaths. The Israeli military said last month that it had killed 17,000 terrorists in Gaza since the beginning of the war against Hamas on Oct. 7. 'Something else that was noticeable this year in the Olympic Games was the double standard of the countries that decide on issues concerning international sports. They truly demonstrated that duel, biased policies govern what they do,' Khamenei claimed during his speech on Tuesday. 'They ban a certain government or country from participating because it started a war somewhere. But with regard to the Zionist regime, which has killed thousands of children and over 41,000 people in less than a single year, they don’t ban it from the Games. This is a double standard. They are being biased.' 'They say sports shouldn’t be mixed with politics, yet they are the ones who exhibit and demonstrate the most politically biased behavior in sports,' he added. Iran’s policy against competing head-to-head with Israeli athletes goes back to 1979. Iranian athletes are often pressured by their coaches and Iranian sports federations to either pull out of matches or intentionally lose to avoid competing against an opponent from Israel. 'Our athlete refuses to compete or play against a Zionist opponent, and because of this, they pay a price. We must not neglect the well-being of this athlete,' Khamenei said on Tuesday. He then stressed that the Iranian government has an obligation to assist with the financial needs of these athletes. Ahead of the Olympic Games in Paris this summer, Israel’s foreign minister warned France of an Iranian-backed terrorist plot to attack Israeli athletes competing in the Olympics. Some athletes in Israel’s Olympic delegation also had their personal information hacked and published online, and Israel’s National Cyber Directorate concluded that Iranian hackers were responsible for the leak. Last year, Iran’s Weightlifting Federation imposed a lifetime ban on Iranian professional weightlifter Mostafa Rajaei for shaking hands with an Israeli athlete at the World Masters Championships in Poland. The head of Iran’s weightlifting federation described his actions as 'unacceptable and unforgivable.'

Belgian minister condemns Israeli attack on Hezbollah as ‘terrori...	Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium 'strongly condemns' Israeli pager attacks that wounded thousands of Hezbollah operatives and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps soldiers in Syria and Lebanon, calling the attacks terrorism. By World Israel News Staff A Belgian deputy prime minister castigated Israel's pager attacks on Hezbollah terrorists and soldiers in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps this week, denouncing the bombings as terrorism. On Wednesday, Petra De Sutter, one of Belgium's seven incumbent deputy prime ministers, a member of the far-left Groen (Green) Party and the first transgender government minister in Europe, called for an international investigation into the waves of bombing attacks against Hezbollah and the IRGC. 'I strongly condemn the massive terror attack in Lebanon and Syria, which injured thousands of people. A brutal escalation of violence.' 'Silence is not an option. An international investigation is called for. The bloodshed must end.' Later on Wednesday, the European Jewish Association took aim at De Sutter's comments, noting her failure to condemn Hezbollah attacks on Israeli civilians. 'Hezbollah and its operatives have been attacking Israel every day, firing hundreds of missiles and drones indiscriminately at civilians,' said EJA chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin, according to a report by Israel National News. 'Calling the pager operation a terror attack is the world upside down.' 'The Deputy Prime Minister’s social media has failed to even mention the Hezbollah missile attack on 12 Israeli Druze children, murdered by a Hezbollah missile in July.' 'It has also failed to condemn Hezbollah’s constant missile and drone attacks on Israeli civilians.' 'Regrettably it is clear that Belgium’s Deputy Prime Minister has completely lost her moral compass.' At least 32 people were killed and over 4,000 more injured in Lebanon, with at least 19 killed and hundreds injured in Syria, after pagers and hand-held radio units used by Hezbollah operatives and their allies in the IRGC exploded in a pair of attacks Tuesday and Wednesday. Israel has yet to comment on the incidents, but is widely suspected of orchestrating the attacks on the pro-Iranian terror group.

Israel launches first autonomous bus pilot on public roads	The trial includes testing the bus in various road, visibility, and weather conditions and assessing its response to pedestrians, other vehicles, traffic circles and unforeseen road events. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Ministry of Transportation gave its approval for the country’s first pilot autonomous bus to operate on a public road along a regular urban route. The ministry authorized Imagry, a Haifa-based autonomous driving software company to begin testing an autonomous bus on public roads in the northern city of Nahariya. 'Israel is at the forefront of global development in vehicle and transportation technologies,' said Transportation Minister Miri Regev. 'Our office has become an incubator for Israeli technology and hi-tech companies alongside companies from around the world, in the fields of smart transportation, which upgrade the travel experience, help reduce congestion on the roads and, above all, contribute significantly to road safety and the preservation of human life.' In partnership with public transportation operator Nativ Express, the electric bus will run an eight-km route beginning and ending at the Nahariya Mall and passing through the city’s busiest areas. The trial includes testing the bus in various road, visibility, and weather conditions and assessing its response to pedestrians, other vehicles, traffic circles and unforeseen road events. Additionally, the bus’s electric motor allows it to travel up to 200 kilometers on a single charge. The autonomous bus, which can accommodate up to 32 passengers, is equipped with an electric ramp to assist wheelchair users. 'The test of the first autonomous bus on a public road marks a historic breakthrough, which brings Israel to the global forefront of smart and safe transportation. The Israeli developments not only improve the travel experience, but form an infrastructure for reducing traffic congestion and increasing road safety,' said Dror Bin, CEO of Israel’s Innovation Authority. 'The next challenge is to turn the vision into a full reality, where the autonomous buses will function completely: from automatic payment collection to adapted solutions for the disabled. What was yesterday science fiction, today becomes a reality on Israel’s roads,' he added.

Bernie Sanders, AOC – Israel is breaking international law	The senator will introduce next week Joint Resolutions of Disapproval in Congress to block future arms sales to Israel. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called Israel out Wednesday for allegedly breaking international humanitarian law as it wars against the terrorists attacking the country. The two leading anti-Israel legislators focused on two separate fronts. Sanders cited on the ongoing battle against the Hamas terrorists who began the war on October 7 by invading Israel, murdering 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, with 101, both alive and dead, still held in captivity in the Gaza Strip. While saying in his Senate speech that Israel 'had an absolute right to respond to the Hamas attack,' he accused Jerusalem of 'bombing indiscriminately' and cited Hamas statistics that 'more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed.' Hamas does not differentiate between combatants and non-combatants’ deaths. The IDF says over a third of those dead are terrorists. Sanders ignored the fact that a two-to-one civilian to soldier death rate in war is an incredibly low number that is acceptable to every army. Calling Congress’ approval of $10 billion in military aid to Israel an act of 'U.S. complicity' in breaking international law as it helps Jerusalem 'buy more of the bombs and weapons they are using to wage war against the Palestinian people,' he announced that next week he would introduce Joint Resolutions of Disapproval to block $20 billion in additional sales that the Biden administration approved last month. If a foreign arms sale is deemed a violation of human rights provisions in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and Arms Export Control Act, these Resolutions are the only way Congress has to block them. The vote would have to pass both Houses and not be vetoed by the president, which is currently considered a highly unlikely scenario. Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez accused Israel of 'unequivocally' violating international law after thousands of beepers and walkie talkies owned by Hezbollah members exploded in Lebanon in two separate incidents Tuesday and Wednesday. 'Israel’s pager attack in Lebanon detonated thousands of handheld devices across of a slew of public spaces, seriously injuring and killing innocent civilians,' the progressive 'Squad' member wrote on X. 'This attack clearly and unequivocally violates international humanitarian law and undermines U.S. efforts to prevent a wider conflict.' Several thousand terrorists were injured, hundreds of them seriously, and at least two dozen were killed by the devices which were on their person. According to initial Lebanese reports, two young children are among the dead in the attacks for which Jerusalem has not admitted responsibility. Ocasio-Cortez demanded 'a full accounting of the attack, including an answer from the State Department as to whether any US assistance went into the development or deployment of this technology.' The U.S. immediately denied having any connection to the sophisticated, remote-controlled strike on the Iranian terror proxy.

Iran recruited Jewish Israeli for Netanyahu assassination plot	Iranian intelligence met with an Israeli businessman, who demanded $1 million to carry out various tasks for Tehran. By World Israel News Staff The Shin Bet foiled an Iranian plot to assassinate high-profile figures in Israel, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the intelligence agency announced in a media statement on Thursday. After Hamas politburo head Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran - an act which was widely attributed to Israel, but for which Jerusalem has not officially claimed responsibility - Iran sought to kill an Israeli leader in retaliation. Iranian intelligence also considered killing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, and former prime minister Naftali Bennett, the Shin Bet said. Iran recruited a Jewish-Israeli businessman living in Turkey as part of their plot, smuggling him twice into Iran to discuss carrying out missions for the Islamic regime in exchange for payment. The Israeli businessman, 73, had lived in Turkey for long periods of time. Tehran was said to have made contact with the man via Turkish businesspeople. The Israeli, who has not been publicly named, was arrested last month. A gag order on reporting about the pending criminal case against him was recently lifted. During his visits to Iran, which occurred in April and August 2024, the Israeli met with high-level Iranian intelligence officials. He was asked to engage in surveillance activities, such as photographing public places in Israel. The Israeli knew that the discussions' goal was to 'advance assassination attacks' on Israeli officials, the Shin Bet said. Iranian officials also asked the Israeli if he could help recruit assassins to kill Iranian dissidents living in exile in the West. The Israeli demanded an advance payment of one million dollars before carrying out any missions on behalf of Iran. That request was denied, but the Iranians provided 5,000 euros in compensation to the Israeli for participating in the meetings. Through his attorney, the businessman claimed that the major security incident was a misunderstanding. The man said that he was tricked into entering Iran, and that he had only done so to meet with an Iranian businessman regarding wholesale purchases of fruits, vegetables, and spices. He was surprised by the presence of Iranian intelligence officials, and their interest in obtaining his assistance in an assassination plot, he said.

By World Israel News Staff Lebanon's foreign minister said that two days of consecutive attacks, which saw electronic devices belonging to Hezbollah members and operatives detonate, have rattled the country and left residents fearing an all-out war between the terror group and Israel. 'There's no doubt, this is a scary moment,' Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN in an interview on Wednesday evening. 'We are afraid of war, and we don't want any war.' The lawmaker said that he viewed the blasts, which injured around 3,000 people and killed at least 24, as unprecedented escalation. The Jewish State has not commented on the explosions, but responsibility for the blasts has widely been attributed to Israel. Bou Habib downplayed Hezbollah's near-daily bombardment of Israeli communities and military assets in northern Israel, referring to the terror group's attacks as cross-border 'skirmishes.' After the explosions, Bou Habib said, 'now we're talking about a war. This is an introduction to a war.' The politician called on the international community to prevent Israel from launching an all-out war against Hezbollah, which would likely result in great devastation throughout Lebanon. 'We are against war in Lebanon,' Bou Habib claimed. 'The government of Lebanon does not want war. So we need the help of the United Nations and the United States in order to reach some kind of peace in south Lebanon.' Bou Habib made no mention of the Lebanese government's enabling of Hezbollah, nor the UN's failure to enforce a resolution which dictates that Hezbollah cannot station fighters south of the Litani River. For months, the U.S. has been attempting to broker a diplomatic solution to the conflict which would see Hezbollah pledge to abide by that geographic boundary. The terror group has refused to budge, causing the Biden administration to pressure Israel to cede land to appease Hezbollah and end the fighting;.

Netanyahu: UK gov’t ‘undermining’ Israel, encouraging Hamas	Netanyahu blasts UK's arms embargo announced just days after hostages were executed, saying the move 'sends a horrible message to Hamas.' By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the UK government on Wednesday, blasting a recent moves by the country's ruling left-wing party such as arms embargo and tacit support for an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant which may be issued against him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'After the October 7 Hamas massacre, the previous British government was clear in its support. Unfortunately, the current government is sending mixed messages,' Netanyahu told UK outlet the Daily Mail. Netanyahu was particularly focused on the move to strip export licenses from UK-based weapons manufacturers providing arms to Israel. 'They say that Israel has the right to defend itself, but they undermine our ability to exercise that right both by reversing Britain’s position on the absurd allegations made by the ICC prosecutor against Israel and by blocking weapons sales to Israel as we fight against the genocidal terrorist organization that carried out the October 7 massacre.' He noted that news of the arms embargo became public just 'days after Hamas executed six Israeli hostages, sending a horrible message to Hamas.' The premier also mentioned the possibility of ICC warrants, which the UK's previous conservative government had staunchly opposed. 'The Labour ­Government decided to drop its challenge to the preposterous ICC arrest warrants that were requested by the ICC prosecutor against the prime minister and the defense minister of Israel,' Netanyahu said. 'If the arrest warrants are issued against the leaders of the only democracy in the Middle East, it will compromise the ability of all democracies in the world to fight terrorism, including Britain,' he warned. Netanyahu ended on an optimistic note, expressing confidence in an eventual Israeli victory over terror. 'Just as Britain’s heroic stand against the Nazis is seen today as having been vital in defeating barbarism, so too will history judge Israel’s stand against Hamas and Iran’s axis of terror. Israel will win this war and secure our common future,' Netanyahu said.

Number of Hezbollah terrorists killed or wounded by beepers likel...	The estimation is that there are many dozens of dead, if not more.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Although the official number indicates that a dozen Hezbollah terrorists have been killed over the last two days by exploding pagers, it is most likely higher than what has been reported. Ronen Bergman, who writes for the New York Times and Yediot Ahronoth, says the number of people killed by the beeper explosions is higher than the reported 12 yesterday and 14 today. 'The estimation is that there are many dozens of dead, if not more,' he said. In addition, the mission caused massive damage to Hezbollah's Radwan unit, which has lost much of its leadership. Israel has not commented on the deadly explosions, which are widely attributed to Israel. The offensive on Tuesday involved the spontaneous explosion of thousands of beepers used by Hezbollah terrorists, wounding thousands and killing over a dozen, according to reports. Additional injuries and deaths occurred on Wednesday in Lebanon and in Syria, where 19 IRGC terrorists were killed and 150 were injured. A former commander of British military forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, praised the beeper offensive against Hezbollah as 'precise and discriminatory' and effective at weakening the morale and capacity of the Lebanese terror group. Israel’s outsmarting them with this terror attack has led to Hezbollah’s 'demoralization.' Kemp also praised the mission because it effectively targeted only terrorists and limited civilian casualties. 'It’s hard to think of a more precise and discriminating method of attack than detonating pagers known to be specifically assigned to individual terrorists, using devices that limit the potential for collateral damage.' He added that the exploding beepers were intended only for terrorists who are 'legitimate and lawful targets for attack as Israel seeks to defend its citizens from violent aggression,' he said. Kemp added that three distinctive characteristics of the mission made it particularly effective. First, the mission resulted in extensive damage to Hezbollah, second it engendered anxiety in Hezbollah members and may discourage others from joining and third, it has humiliated Hezbollah on the world stage.

Exploding beepers were intended only for terrorists who are 'legitimate and lawful targets for attack as Israel seeks to defend its citizens from violent aggression.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The former commander of British military forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, praised the beeper offensive against Hezbollah as 'precise and discriminatory' and effective at weakening the morale and capacity of the Lebanese terror group. The offensive on Tuesday involved the spontaneous explosion of thousands of beepers used by Hezbollah terrorists, wounding thousands and killing over a dozen. Additional injuries and deaths occurred on Wednesday in Lebanon and in Syria, where 19 IRGC terrorists were killed and 150 were injured. Kemp told Israel National News that three salient factors make the beeper mission uniquely effective. 'First, it will have done immense damage to the terrorist organization, taking a large number of its fighters and leaders out in one go. Plus, of course, it severely undermines their communications capability,' Kemp said. He added, 'Second, it will have intimidated Hezbollah, potentially frightening some members into leaving the group or scaring off recruits from joining.' Kemp explained, 'The psychological impact will be enormous, with every Hezbollah terrorist now fearing that almost everything he owns or touches, including cars, guns, laptops, radios, and other electrical items, could potentially be weaponized against them.' He added the constant anxiety Hezbollah members may feel now is a 'far cry from the supposed glory of battlefield martyrdom they were promised.' In addition, Hezbollah may retreat from the notion of a full-scale offensive against Israel since now they realize their terror group operations and technology have been infiltrated. 'Third, it has humiliated Hezbollah, a terrorist organization that struts its power on the world stage, presenting itself as one of the strongest armies in the Middle East.' Israel's outsmarting them with this terror attack has led to Hezbollah's 'demoralization.' Kemp also praised the mission because it effectively targeted only terrorists and limited civilian casualties. 'It’s hard to think of a more precise and discriminating method of attack than detonating pagers known to be specifically assigned to individual terrorists, using devices that limit the potential for collateral damage.'

UN bans Israel’s right to self-defense, calls for removal of Jews...	Only 14 countries, including the United States, joined Israel in opposing the resolution. By Mike Wagenheim, JNS Jerusalem’s Old City and Jude and Samaria must be judenrein within a year, according to a Palestinian-drafted resolution, which the U.N. General Assembly passed on Wednesday. The resolution, which passed by a 124-14 margin with 43 abstentions, is meant to give force to a July advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice, which declared Israeli presence to be illegal in any area over the 1949 armistice line. More than 40 countries sponsored the resolution, which was the first that Palestinians filed after being granted unprecedented privileges, for a non-U.N. member, earlier this year. The resolution calls on the Israel Defense Forces to withdraw completely from Judea and Samaria, eastern Jerusalem and Gaza within 12 months, which means evacuating all Jewish communities beyond the armistice line, including Jerusalem’s Old City. It also bans arms sales to the IDF of any equipment that would be expected reasonably to be used in the territory over the 1949 lines and calls for a boycott of all products produced by Jews in those areas. The resolution text lacks any mention of Israeli security concerns, historic ties to the lands or Hamas’s terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. The vote came after a day of debate on Tuesday. Argentina, Czechia, Fiji, Hungary, Malawi, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga, Tuvalu and the United States joined Israel in opposing the resolution. Notably, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Ukraine and Australia were among those who abstained. General Assembly resolutions have no legal force, but the resolution’s passage on Wednesday is expected to be used in international courts and other fora to seek additional action against the Jewish state. It is widely expected that the Palestinians will request that the U.N. Security Council take up the issue. Security Council resolutions are binding, but the United States would be expected to thwart such an effort, including with its veto power. ‘Further fuel on worldwide antisemitism’ Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, called it 'a shameful decision that backs the Palestinian Authority’s diplomatic terrorism.' He added that the General Assembly 'continues to dance to the music of the Palestinian Authority, which backs the Hamas murderers.' Before the vote, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told reporters he would back the implementation of the resolution should it pass. Seth Riklin and Daniel Mariaschin, president and CEO respectively of B’nai B’rith International, said that the international nonprofit is 'appalled' by the 'atrocious' resolution. 'B’nai B’rith International strongly condemns the U.N. General Assembly’s passage of the first resolution officially sponsored by Palestinians days after they became the first non-member state group further upgraded to many member state privileges at the U.N. General Assembly, despite the world body’s own rules and practices,' the duo stated. 'Coming from an assembly in which Arab and other pro-Palestinian governments wield an automatic majority to annually condemn Israel more than all other countries combined, the motion is unprecedented in its shamelessly one-sided endorsement of Palestinian claims and political demands, and further erodes the U.N.’s credibility as a serious contributor to promoting conflict-resolution and universal human rights,' they added. 'Shame on all countries that enabled this atrocious affront to justice and peace as part of the latest UNGA ’emergency session’ on the Middle East that does nothing to help seriously address and settle the emergency,' Riklin and Mariaschin said. Arsen Ostrovsky and Nadav Steinman, CEO and board chair respectively of the International Legal Forum, stated that 'today, simply put, the United Nations has become the diplomatic arm of Hamas' and that the resolution 'is just the latest in a litany of obscenely one-sided anti-Israel resolutions at the U.N. since Oct. 7.' 'All it does is reward the murderers, rapists and abductors of Hamas while pouring further fuel on worldwide antisemitism and eroding whatever remaining credibility of the already problematic and politicized International Court of Justice, upon which this resolution is meant to be based,' they added. 'Ultimately, peace will only prevail when Hamas is defeated and the hostages are released, not through tiresome antics and pyrrhic Palestinian ‘victories’ at the U.N.'

Finland’s president defends decisions to buy Israeli arms, not re...	President Alexander Stubb, who took office in March, has defined his and Finland’s new foreign policy stance as 'values-based realism.' By Reuters and The Algemeiner Finland’s President Alexander Stubb defended his country’s decision to buy arms from Israel despite the war in Gaza, saying it had no link to Finland’s unwillingness to recognize an independent Palestinian state at the present time. Finland is acquiring a ground based, high altitude, missile defense system called David’s Sling from Israel. Helsinki considers the system a high priority for its own defense due to neighboring Russia’s ongoing missile attacks on civilian and military targets in Ukraine. Stubb, who took office in March, has defined his and Finland’s new foreign policy stance as 'values-based realism,' which he has said was about 'achieving things in the world as it is,' instead of 'promoting only the world how I want to see it.' In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Stubb said the time was not right to recognize a Palestinian state, even though its Nordic neighbors, Sweden, Iceland, and most recently Norway, have done so. 'In the case of Israel and Palestine, values-based realism is prevalent in our thinking on the recognition of Palestine in the sense that we want that recognition, not if, but when it happens, to have an impact towards a two-state solution and a peaceful solution,' he said. Last month, Stubb told Finnish diplomats that Finland’s recognition of a Palestinian state was 'a matter of time' and that the right time would be picked strategically to promote peace in the Middle East. He said the decision had 'nothing to do with' the arms deal with Israel. 'In that one, I only look at realism, in other words, the fact that we need those weapons. So that’s when I look at Finnish security.'

More Hezbollah comms devices explode across Lebanon, killing 14	At least one of the blasts took place in the vicinity of a funeral for terrorists killed on Tuesday. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS More communications devices used by Hezbollah terrorists exploded on Wednesday afternoon across the group’s main stronghold in Beirut and in Southern Lebanon, Reuters reported, citing a security source. According to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, at least fourteen Hezbollah operatives were killed in the latest series of device explosions. In addition, some 400 terrorists were said to have sustained wounds. At least one of the blasts took place in the vicinity of a funeral for terrorists killed on Tuesday, when thousands of Hezbollah pagers detonated all over the country, according to eyewitness reports. The Hezbollah devices that exploded late Wednesday afternoon are hand-held walkie-talkies, a Lebanese security source told Reuters. Axios cited sources familiar with the matter as saying that the radios, which were booby-trapped in advance by Israeli intelligence, were part of the terror group’s emergency communications systems that were supposed to be used during a conflict with the Israel Defense Forces. תיעוד | פיצוץ מכשיר בביירות בזמן הלווית אחד ממחבלי חזבאללה שחוסלו אתמול@Doron_Kadosh pic.twitter.com/rT6dlmutpb &mdash; גלצ (@GLZRadio) September 18, 2024 On Tuesday, more than 2,700 Hezbollah operatives were wounded and at least 12 were killed across Lebanon when their pagers exploded, with the terrorist organization saying it held Israel 'fully responsible.' Speaking at a Wednesday funeral for several of the terrorists killed the day prior, Hezbollah executive council head Hashem Safieddine vowed a 'bloodily unique revenge' against the Jewish state, local reports said. 'Tomorrow, the leader of Hezbollah will speak and all will be revealed,' Safieddine said. 'We will be in a new situation and a new confrontation with this enemy.' The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on Tuesday’s incident, which came just hours after the Israeli Cabinet added the return of citizens displaced from their homes in the north to the country’s war goals, bringing a potential major clash with Hezbollah closer to reality. Iran-backed Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, firing thousands of rockets, missiles and drones. The attacks have so far killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage. Tens of thousands of civilians remain internally displaced due to the violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein this week that displaced Israelis will not be able to return home without strong military or diplomatic action against Hezbollah. Netanyahu 'made it very clear that it will not be possible to return our residents without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north,' Netanyahu’s office stated after a Monday meeting in Tel Aviv. Jerusalem will 'ultimately do what is necessary to safeguard its security and return the residents of the north securely to their homes,' he vowed.

Holocaust mass grave found in Belarusian town	Estimates suggest that between 3,000 and 4,000 Jews from Stresyn and neighboring towns fell victim to the Holocaust. By Jewish Breaking News A small Belarusian town now stands as a sobering testament to the Holocaust’s devastation after the discovery this week of a mass grave holding Jewish victims. Once home to a thriving Jewish community, Stresyn and its surrounding Gomel region bore witness to the Holocaust’s devastation. In 1939, Jews comprised nearly 30% of the area’s population, with around 40,000 residents. While many managed to flee before the Nazi occupation in 1941, those who remained faced confinement in three ghettos with staggeringly high mortality rates. Estimates suggest that between 3,000 and 4,000 Jews from Stresyn and neighboring towns fell victim to the Holocaust. Among the 23 bodies found on Tuesday were those of 12 adults and 11 children, the youngest barely a year old and the oldest child just seven. While the remains showed no obvious signs of execution, the discovery of keys and a corroded rifle bullet within the burial site hints at the horror experienced by Stresyn’s Jewish community during the Final Solution. Local authorities suggest that these individuals likely succumbed to the inhumane conditions within the ghetto, where Jewish residents were forcibly relocated after having their property looted by the invading Nazis. According to state news agency Balta, a local resident uncovered the remains during routine agricultural work nearly 15 years ago. Despite widespread community knowledge about the ghetto’s Jewish victims, the grave’s existence curiously remained unreported until now.

John Fetterman slams ‘anti-Israel’ UN experts for censuring Weste...	The most outspoken of the UN experts on Monday was Francesca Albanese, the UN’s notoriously controversial special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner US Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) lambasted 'anti-Israel' UN human rights experts for censuring Western countries on Monday over their continued support for Israel despite what they described as a genocide in Gaza. 'These so-called ‘experts’ have consistently revealed their anti-Israel bias and a censure from one of them is a badge of honor,' Fetterman posted on X/Twitter. 'No apologies and zero conditions for any essential support for Israel.' Fetterman also posted a picture from a news story reporting on the warnings from the UN experts. These so-called ‘experts’ have consistently revealed their anti-Israel bias and a censure from one of them is a badge of honor. No apologies and zero conditions for any essential support for Israel. pic.twitter.com/YMZUOYmw1J &mdash; Senator John Fetterman (@SenFettermanPA) September 16, 2024 The most outspoken of the UN experts on Monday was Francesca Albanese, the UN’s notoriously controversial special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories. 'Shockingly, in the face of the abyss reached in the OPT [Occupied Palestinian Territories] … most member states remained inactive at best, or actively aiding and assisting Israel’s criminal conduct,' Albanese told a press conference in Geneva. 'I think it’s unavoidable for Israel to become a pariah in the face of its continuous, relentless, vilifying assault of the United Nations, on top of millions of Palestinians.' Israel has denied such allegations, noting the extensive lengths to which its military has gone to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, where Hamas often places its military targets within or underneath civilian targets such as schools and hospitals. Though Fetterman campaigned as a progressive, he has surprisingly emerged as a staunch ally of Israel in the months following Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attacks. Fetterman has repeatedly condemned anti-Israel voices within his own party in the US Congress, as well as elite universities for tolerating what he has characterized as antisemitic and anti-Israel hate speech on their campuses. Fetterman’s criticism came as Brown University in Rhode Island received backlash over its decision to host Albanese for a discussion on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Ivy League university hosted Albanese, an Italian lawyer, for a talk on Monday titled 'Anatomy of a Genocide: A Failure of the International System?' The roughly hour-and-a-half discussion centered on the international community’s response to Israel’s ongoing defensive military operations in Hamas-ruled Gaza. Toward the beginning of the discussion, Albanese decried Israel’s military campaign as the 'monstrosity of this century.' 'To justify the protection of their security, Israel continues to take land from the Palestinians, subjugate the Palestinians, and impose conditions of life that result in humiliation and indignities,' Albanese said during the livestream. Though Albanese insisted that she has repeatedly condemned Hamas’s Oct. 7 slaughter of roughly 1,200 people and kidnapping of 251 others in southern Israel, she said she believes the Jewish state’s response has been disproportionate. As Albanese has done many times before, she accused Israel of targeting schools, hospitals, designated safe zones, and using starvation as a weapon against the population. Israel has denied such accusations, noting its efforts to evacuate areas before it targets them and to warn residents of impending military operations with leaflets, text messages, and other forms of communication. However, Hamas has in many cases prevented people from leaving, according to the Israeli military. Another challenge for Israel is Hamas’s widely recognized military strategy of embedding its terrorists within Gaza’s civilian population and commandeering civilian facilities like hospitals, schools, and mosques to run operations and direct attacks. Nonetheless, Albanese condemned Israel’s allies, saying they 'should have changed course of action,' citing concerns over the humanitarian conditions in Gaza. 'Instead they have continued to give Israel financial, economic, and political support and courage, and this is the failure of the system,' Albanese said. She expressed gratitude toward students and university faculty members who have participated in anti-Israel demonstrations against Israel’s so-called 'genocidal' war in Gaza. Albanese’s participation in an official Brown University event drew widespread backlash from members of the school’s academic community. Over 2,400 members of the Brown community signed a letter urging the school to disinvite the controversial UN expert. Albanese has been widely criticized for exhibiting an apparent bias against Israel. Albanese has an extensive history of using her role at the UN to denigrate Israel and seemingly rationalize Hamas’s attacks on the Jewish state. In the months following Hamas’s brutal Oct. 7 assault on the Jewish state, Albanese has accused Israel of enacting a 'genocide'against the Palestinian people in revenge for the Oct. 7 attacks. The United Nations has recently launched a probe against Albanese over allegedly accepting a trip to Australia funded by pro-Hamas organizations. She has called on the UN to expel Israel, comparing the Jewish state to apartheid-era South Africa.

19 Iranian soldiers killed, 150 injured in pager bombings, Israel...	Israel's pager bombing attack on Hezbollah also impacted Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces in Syria, killing 19 and wounding 150. By World Israel News Staff At least 19 soldiers in Iran's paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed and roughly 150 more were injured in pager explosions in eastern Syria, according to Arabic media reports Wednesday. On Tuesday, thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah operatives across Lebanon detonated simultaneously in a mass attack attributed to Israel. Eleven people were killed and roughly 4,000 injured in the explosions in Lebanon. According to a report by the Saudi-based Al Hadath outlet on Wednesday, however, the pager bombings also killed 19 members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps stationed in the Deir Ez-Zur province of eastern Syria. In addition, some 150 other Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps members were injured, Al Hadath reported. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was among those injured in the attack, reportedly being completely blinded in one eye and partially blinded in the other. While Iran initially downplayed the severity of his injuries, The New York Times reported that not only was Amani blinded, but that he lost one eye in the attack, while the other was seriously damaged, leaving him with extremely limited vision. Hossein Soleimani, who heads the IRGC’s news website Mashregh, confirmed on X that Amani had been seriously wounded, several hours after the blasts. 'Unfortunately the injuries sustained by Iran’s ambassador were extremely severe and in his eyes,' Soleimani wrote, acknowledging the severity of Amani's injuries. Some 500 Hezbollah operatives were also blinded, either partially or entirely, as a result of the pager explosions, Al Hadath reported. Media reports after Tuesday’s attack implicated Israel’s Mossad, amid claims its agents implanted miniature explosive devices inside a shipment of thousands of pagers bound for Lebanon’s Hezbollah five months ago. Israel is widely believed to be behind the operation but remains silent and has not acknowledged responsibility.

Dozens of Israeli ministers and Coalition MKs demand Israeli take...	The 27 coalition members urged the prime minister to adopt the 'Generals’ Plan' of a group of generals designed to put real pressure on Hamas. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Dozens of MKs and ministers from the coalition wrote a letter Wednesday urging the prime minister to back a plan written by a group of generals that calls for a full Israeli takeover of northern Gaza in order to put real pressure on Hamas and win the war. The 27 ministers and Coalition members have asked Benjamin Netanyahu to convene the security cabinet and adopt the 'Generals’ Plan' that had been presented to the public by the Commanders and Reserve Soldiers Forum a few weeks ago. 'The recent cabinet decision regarding the permanent presence of our soldiers in the Philadelphi Corridor requires, in our opinion, a strategic complement with another action,' they wrote. The Generals’ Plan was written by respected reserve IDF commanders, including Generals Giora Eiland (former national security adviser and ex-head of IDF Operations), Gershon Hacohen (former commander of the IDF military colleges) and Avi Mizrachi (ex-head of Central Command). The proposal says that the approximately 300,000 Palestinian residents in the northern section of the Strip, including Gaza City and its environs, should be given a week’s warning to evacuate along two humanitarian corridors secured by the IDF. This is about 40% of the coastal enclave, and has been surrounded by the IDF for many months already. It would be declared a closed military zone, Eiland said in an explanatory video released earlier this month, and 'nothing would be allowed in.' The result would be that 'The 5,000 Hamas fighters in this area can then either decide to surrender or die of starvation.' If they decide to fight instead, the IDF would be able to deal with them. Losing the whole north, Eiland noted, 'will create real pressure' on Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, 'who will understand that what happened [there] can happen later, whether in Rafah or other places' in Gaza. Another part of the plan is for the army to take over all food and aid distribution to the civilian population instead of the current situation in which Hamas confiscates it all by force, both for its own use and to enrich itself to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by selling what had been donated for free in order to keep Gazans from supposed starvation. As the MKs’ letter stated, Hamas’ control of the humanitarian aid 'gives it full control over the population [and] over the recruitment of fighters, in addition to strengthening its fighting forces and bringing in enormous economic profit.' In recapping the main points of the plan, those who signed the letter stated that they believe, as these generals do, that these are the steps that will enable the government to finally achieve its stated war goals of rescuing the hostages, destroying Hamas’ ability to govern, and ensuring that Gaza will not threaten Israel in the future.

Rosh Hashanah bombing targeted former Israeli defense minister	Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah attempted to assassinate former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon in failed Rosh Hashanah bombing attack in Tel Aviv. By World Israel News Staff A terrorist cell operated by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah organization in Lebanon attempted to assassinate a former Israeli Defense Minister and ex-IDF chief of staff in a bombing attack during the Rosh Hashanah holiday last year, Israeli police revealed on Wednesday. The plot targeted Moshe Ya'alon, chief of the IDF General Staff from 2002 to 2005, who later entered politics on the Likud ticket, serving as Defense Minister before bolting the party and joining Benny Gantz's Blue and White. According to police, Hezbollah terrorists operating out of Lebanon directed a nine-member terrorist cell inside of Israel, made up of eight Arab-Israelis and controlled by a single Lebanese handler. The nine cell members were originally enlisted by their Hezbollah handler for weapons smuggling last summer. According to the investigation, conducted by Israel Police and the Shin Bet internal security agency, the cell members were initially told they would be smuggling drugs into Israel from Lebanon. Communicating with their Hezbollah handler via the Whatsapp social media platform, two cell members collected nine packages from a designated collection point along the border barrier. Later, however, the two cell members found that the packages contained weapons, rather than drugs. The weapons included rifles, pistols, and anti-personnel mines. On August 31st, Hezbollah instructed the cell to purchase remote-control cameras, with one cell member ordered to leave his vehicle parked at Tel Aviv's Hayarkon Park. On September 1st, a member of the cell assembled a makeshift bomb using the anti-personnel mine and the remote-control cameras, with the goal of enabling the cell to watch a live feed of the bomb, waiting for the target to approach before remotely detonating it. Eleven days later, three days before the planned bombing, the device was retrieved from a hiding place and brought to Tel Aviv. On September 15th, the bomb detonated prematurely at 6:30 a.m., forcing one of the cell members to flee to the Beit Hanina neighborhood in Jerusalem with the aid of a second cell member. Both cell members were arrested en route to Jerusalem later that day, with six others arrested during the subsequent investigation. According to the Shin Bet and Israel Police and based on interrogations of the suspects, the cell members had planned to kill Ya'alon during his daily jog through Hayarkon Park on the eve of the Rosh Hashanah holiday. All eight of the arrested suspects have been indicted on terror charges, while the ninth member of the has been charge in absentia.

Taiwanese electronics company denies it manufactured pagers used ...	Gold Apollo claims it was not responsible for manufacturing the pagers which were apparently modified by Israeli agents and used to bomb thousands of Hezbollah terrorists. By World Israel News Staff A Taiwanese electronics company denied Wednesday that it was involved in the manufacturing of pagers used by Hezbollah terrorists and detonated in a mass attack on Tuesday, injuring thousands of operatives in the Iranian-backed group. Media reports after Tuesday's attack implicated Israel's Mossad, amid claims its agents implanted miniature explosive devices inside a shipment of thousands of pagers bound for Lebanon's Hezbollah five months ago. According to an analysis by Reuters of images of pagers destroyed in Tuesday's attack, the devices were manufactured by Taiwan's Gold Apollo. However, on Wednesday, Gold Apollo founder and president Hsu Ching-Kuang told reporters outside of the company's headquarters in New Taipei that his company was not involved in manufacturing the devices. 'The product was not ours. It was only that it had our brand on it,' Hsu said. 'We may not be a large company, but we are a responsible one,' the Gold Apollo president said, expressing surprise that the pagers could be rigged with explosives and detonated. 'This is very embarrassing.' In a statement issued by Gold Apollo, the company claimed that the AR-924 model pager was manufactured by Budapest-based company BAC Consulting, and that Gold Apollo had licensed its brand to BAC Consulting. Gold Apollo had granted permission to 'BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in specific regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are entirely handled by BAC,' the company said. Reuters reported Wednesday that it was unable to contact BAC after Tuesday's bombing. Hsu said BAC's payments to Gold Apollo for use of its license were 'very strange,' saying the payments originated in the Middle East.

Invasion soon? IDF moves thousands of troops to northern border	Elite IDF division transferred to Lebanon border, amidst threat of all-out war between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group. By World Israel News Staff Amid sky-high tensions between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group, the Israeli army announced on Wednesday that it is deploying tens of thousands of troops to the northern border. The move comes one day after an alleged Mossad and IDF intelligence operation saw the simultaneous detonation of thousands of beepers belonging to Hezbollah members in Lebanon and Syria, killing at least nine and wounding some 3,000. The IDF said that it was transferring the elite 98th Division, numbering some 10,000 to 20,000 troops, to the border with Lebanon. The units within the 98th Division include paratroopers, artillery units, and commandos. Previously, the 98th Division was stationed in Khan Younes in central Gaza, but withdrew from the area in August. The 98th Division will join the 36th Division and numerous reserve units, which have been stationed along the northern border for months. In recent days, Israeli officials have signaled that the IDF is gearing up for an intensive military offensive against Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant both hinted to the Biden administration's envoy to the Middle East, Amos Hochstein, that time had run out for a diplomatic solution to end the fighting with Hezbollah. For more than 11 months, Hezbollah has bombarded communities and military assets in northern Israel with near-daily barrages of missiles, rockets, and explosive drones. At least 60,000 Israelis were displaced from their homes due to the ongoing aerial assaults. Tens of thousands more, who were not evacuated from their homes, live under constant threat of Hezbollah aggression. On Monday, the security cabinet officially declared the return of displaced northern to their home as a goal for the ongoing war. Former IAF commander Ori Gordin said that Israel will need to create a buffer zone in southern Lebanon, in order to protect residents of northern Israel and to prevent the Hezbollah terror group from operating in the region.

Republican senators lobby Latin America to vote against UN resolu...	As UN General Assembly debates Palestinian Authority draft resolution ordering Israel to ethnically cleanse Judea and Samaria of Jews within one year, Republican senators lobby Western hemisphere powers to reject the proposal. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The United Nations General Assembly held hearings Tuesday on a draft resolution submitted by Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian Authority's envoy to the U.N., demanding Israel vacate Judea and Samaria within one year, and calling on countries around the world to impose arms embargoes on the Jewish state. The General Assembly is slated to vote on the draft resolution Wednesday, after the body debated the measure a day earlier. If passed, the current version of the non-binding resolution would demand Israel remove not only its military presence in Judea and Samaria but also ethnically cleanse the area of its roughly half a million Jewish residents. Republican senators protested the proposed resolution Tuesday, issuing a joint statement penned by Florida's Marco Rubio, calling the measure a 'absolute disgrace that rewards terrorism.' 'This proposal introduced by the Palestinian delegation, ahead of the United Nations’ General Assembly, is an absolute disgrace that rewards terrorism. It is a clear insult to the Jewish people and anyone who understands history,' the letter reads. 'As we approach the one-year anniversary of the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas and affiliated Palestinian terrorist groups against innocent Israeli civilians, which involved murder, mutilation, and sexual violence, the international community must unequivocally unite against this evil, one-sided effort to delegitimize Israel.' 'Instead of proposing biased and counter-productive initiatives, which will do nothing to advance a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, the international community must focus its energy and resources on ensuring Hamas and other terrorist groups are completely destroyed. We must remain firm to ensure every single hostage held by these terrorists is safely returned to their loved ones.' The letter was signed by Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Rick Scott (R-FL), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY),Tim Scott (R-SC), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Jim Risch (R-ID), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), John Kennedy (R-LA), John Hoeven (R-ND), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Budd (R-NC), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), J.D. Vance (R-OH), John Barrasso (R-WY), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Josh Hawley (R-MO), James Lankford (R-OK), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Mike Braun (R-IN), John Thune (R-SD), Roger Wicker (R-MS), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Katie Boyd Britt (R-AL). In addition to the letter condemning the draft resolution, Senator Rubio penned letters to two Latin American leaders - Argentinian President Javier Milei and Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader - urging them to vote against the measure in the General Assembly. 'The resolution…calls on countries to not legally recognize Israel’s presence in the Palestinian areas, enforce sanctions on Israeli officials, cease the transfer of arms to Israel that could be used in the Palestinian areas and to avoid establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem,' Rubio wrote. 'These are severe demands that aim to destroy the independence of the Middle East’s only democracy. All democracies should oppose these adverse ambitions.'

Gazans beginning to regret October 7th invasion – poll	Only 39% still back the decision to attack Israel on October 7, while PA Arabs sharply differ, with 64% standing behind it. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A Palestinian poll published Tuesday shows that for the first time in nearly a year of fighting, only a minority of Gazans still support Hamas’ October 7th invasion of Israel. The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) survey showed that only 39% still backed the invasion, a massive drop of 18 percentage points from the last survey three months ago. Among Palestinian Authority (PA) Arabs, the decision to attack still enjoys 64% support, although this number reflects a drop of 13 points since the last poll, conducted in June. Taken together, a slight majority of 53% still say that Hamas was correct to invade. The PCPSR noted that this support 'does not necessarily mean support for Hamas and does not mean support for any killings or atrocities committed against civilians,' citing the statistic that almost 90% of the public does not believe that Hamas forces committed 'the atrocities depicted in videos taken on that day.' Instead, Palestinians back the attack because they believe that it 'put the Palestinian issue at the center of attention and eliminated years of neglect at the regional and international levels,' the Center said. This does not necessarily translate to an expectation that Hamas will win the war against Israel, although again there is a sharp dichotomy between the Gazans who are experiencing it, and PA Arabs who are not. While in June the conviction that Hamas would ultimately be victorious was split almost evenly among Gazans, with 48% believing this was true, the latest poll shows a hard drop to 28%. PA Arabs are much more optimistic, with 65% saying Hamas would win, although this does reflect a drop of 14 points from the last poll. The contrast continued with the question of who will control Gaza after the war, with 37% of Strip residents (down from 46%) and fully 70% of PA Arabs saying Hamas will continue to rule the coastal enclave. When asked whom they prefer to govern them, similar numbers said Hamas, while overall 20% chose the PA, 12% preferred international forces, and four percent said the IDF. The survey also asked respondents to grade their satisfaction with how regional actors are supporting them. Yemen came first by a large margin with 69%, most probably on the basis of the missile attacks on Israel by the country’s Houthi terrorists. Hezbollah, which has launched some 8,000 rockets, UAV and other airborne threats at Israel since October 8 to support Hamas, came in second, at 44%. Qatar, which has supported Hamas with billions of dollars over the years and is now acting as a mediator in negotiations for a hostages-for-ceasefire deal, was a close third at 43%. Iran only received an approving nod from 33%, which is a 16-point drop from June. This, said the polling agency, 'seems to be due to the belief of the overwhelming majority (76%) that it will not retaliate for the assassination of [Hamas political head] Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.' Armed struggle was considered the most effective way to gain a state by 48%, a drop of six points from June. The three-month drop was extremely sharp in Gaza, however – a whopping 20 points. Negotiations were a distant second at 30%, although this represented a five point rise. The PCPSR said it conducted its survey by telephone or tablet in areas of the Gaza Strip where there was no fighting currently going on, but noted that it excluded the quiet northern section due to technical difficulties. In all, 1,200 people were surveyed, 790 in the PA and 410 in Gaza. The margin of error was 3.5%.

US denies involvement in pager attack on Hezbollah	Israel did not give US advance notice of mass pager attack on Hezbollah terrorists, Biden administration official says, distancing US from the attack. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration on Tuesday distanced itself from the apparent mass pager bombing attack, attributed to Israel, against thousands of members of the Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah, claiming that the U.S. was neither involved in the attack nor did the U.S. have any prior knowledge of it. Speaking with reporters at a press briefing Tuesday, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the administration was still looking into the attacks, but emphasized that the U.S. played no role in them, adding that Israel did not disclose its plans to the administration prior to the attack. 'We are gathering information on this incident,' Matthew said. 'I can tell you that the U.S. was not involved in it, the U.S. was not aware of this incident in advance.' 'We’re collecting information in the same way that journalists are across the world to gather the facts about what might have happened.' Miller expressed concern the attack could lead to greater escalations between Israel on one hand and Hezbollah and Iran on the other, and called on all parties to reach a 'diplomatic solution.' 'We are always concerned about any type of event that may cause further escalation. And it remains our message to both Israel and to other parties that they need to do everything they can to try and reach a diplomatic resolution.' Reiterating the Biden administration's support for a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, Miller said an agreement between Israel and Hamas could pave the way for a 'resolution' on Israel's northern border. 'Go back to the fundamental issue we face here which is very difficult to get a diplomatic resolution in the north absent a resolution to the conflict in Gaza, absent a ceasefire in Gaza, which is why we continue to push for that ceasefire because we think it’ll help make it much easier to reach a resolution.'

‘Use it or lose it’ – Israel forced to use mass pager attack pree...	Hezbollah terrorists were reportedly close to uncovering Israel's modifications to the terror group's pagers, forcing Israel to preemptively use the mass attack. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's attack on thousands of Hezbollah terrorists across Lebanon and Syria Tuesday had originally been planned to take place only in the event of a full-scale war on the Israel-Lebanon border, three U.S. officials claim, and was only carried out amid concerns the terror group was close to revealing Israel's modifications to the electronic beepers used in the attack. On Tuesday, thousands of pager devices issued to Hezbollah operatives and associates detonated en masse, killing eleven and injuring roughly 4,000. The devices reportedly exploded as part of a large-scale attack conducted by Israel's Mossad, which is claimed to have implanted miniature explosive devices in the Hezbollah pagers five months ago, prior to their delivery to Lebanon. However, according to three U.S. officials cited in a report by Axios Wednesday, the pager attack had been held in reserve by Israel, and was slated for use only if a full-scale war broke out between Israel and Hezbollah. Recently, however, Israeli intel officials came to believe that the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group was close to discovering the modifications to the pagers, forcing Israel to either activate the devices immediately, or lose its capability. 'It was a use it or lose it moment,' one U.S. official explained, saying that Israel had informed the U.S. of its reasoning for the timing of Tuesday's attack. According to a former Israeli official cited by Axios, the operation had been planned as an opening salvo in a potential full-scale war with Hezbollah, crippling the terror group's leadership and sowing chaos in its ranks at the outset of the war. A separate report by Al-Monitor claimed that two Hezbollah terrorists had recently raised concerns regarding the group's pagers over the past few days, sparking fears in Israel's intelligence community the explosive devices were on the verge of discovery.

Iranian ambassador blinded by Hezbollah beeper blast – report	Iranian ambassador's injuries prove clear link between Iran and the Hezbollah terror group. By World Israel News Staff Iran's ambassador to Lebanon was seriously wounded during the coordinated explosion of beepers used by Hezbollah members on Tuesday, with international media reports indicating that he was left blinded by the blast. According to a New York Times report, Ambassador Mojtaba Amani lost one eye in the explosion. His surviving eye was seriously damaged, leaving him with extremely limited vision. In a brief statement on Tuesday, the Iranian government admitted that Amani was wounded in the incident, but downplayed the severity of his injuries and said he was 'in good general condition' after being treated at a hospital. That false narrative was repeated by Amani's wife, Narges Ghadirian, who wrote on X that her husband was 'slightly injured, but thank God he is all right and the danger has passed.' Some unconfirmed reports are reporting that the Iran ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani has been injured in his eyes after checking his beeper potentially making him blind. We will confirm as we know. pic.twitter.com/biXkeE192I &mdash; Open Source Intel (@Osint613) September 17, 2024 Hossein Soleimani, who heads the IRGC's news website Mashregh, confirmed on X that Amani had been seriously wounded, several hours after the blasts. 'Unfortunately the injuries sustained by Iran’s ambassador were extremely severe and in his eyes,' Soleimani wrote. Tehran is planning to repatriate Amani on an emergency flight for additional medical care at a hospital in Iran. The fact that Amani was in possession of a beeper that exploded demonstrates the deep ties between Iran and the Hezbollah terror group. Two members of the IRGC confirmed to the New York Times that the beepers were only used by Hezbollah operatives and members. Iran is a long-time patron of Hezbollah, providing them with training, funding, and weapons for use against Israel. But Iran has often claimed that Hezbollah is not their proxy group, characterizing them as an Islamic resistance organization fighting for Lebanon, rather than at the behest of Tehran. Lebanon and Iran have blamed Israel for the explosions, which killed at least 9 people and injured some 3,000 more. Israel has refused to comment on the incident.

4 IDF soldiers killed, 6 wounded in Gaza fighting	Combat paramedic is first female soldiers to be killed in battle in the Strip. By World Israel News Staff Four Israeli soldiers were killed during the ongoing fighting against the Hamas terror group in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, the IDF announced in a media statement after their families were informed. They were named as Captain Daniel Maimon Toaff, 23, of Moreshet, Sergeant Agam Naim, 20, of Mishmarot, Sergeant Amit Bachari, 21, of Yoshivia, and Sergeant Dotan Shimon, 21, of Elazar. According to a report from Hebrew-language Mako news, investigators believed the four were killed by an explosive device, either hurled by terrorists at a building in which they were standing, or a booby-trap within the building that detonated when they entered. Toaff, Bachari, and Shimon were all combat soldiers in the Givati Brigade's Shaked Battalion stationed in the southern Strip. Naim, who was a paramedic, is the first female soldier to be killed in the Gaza Strip since the ground invasion began in late October 2023. 'We don't believe it. She was the most charming girl, beloved by all, a friend. She loved the role, she was extremely dedicated' to serving as a combat paramedic, said Ofek, a high-school friend of the late Naim, told Mako. 'Who could imagine? This is heart-breaking.' In the same incident in which the four were killed, an additional five soldiers were wounded and evacuated to hospitals in Israel. Three of them are listed as being in serious condition. Also on Tuesday, in a separate incident also in the southern region the Strip, another Givati soldier was seriously wounded in battle. The Israel death toll in the ground invasion now stands at 348, including a civilian contractor who was killed and Amnon Zamora, a police officer who was killed during the hostage rescue operation that freed Noa Argamani, Shlomi Ziv, Andrey Kozlov, and Almog Meir Jan.

American Jew sentenced to death for role in foiled coup in Congo	Zalman-Polun is now also the target of conspiracy theories that claim he is a CIA and Mossad agent sent to destabilize the Congolese government. By Jackie Hajdenberg, JTA An American Jew is facing the death penalty for his involvement in an attempted political coup in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in late May. Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun — a Washington, D.C.-area native and father of three — was one of three Americans and 37 people total sentenced to death Friday in the DRC over an attempt in May. The failed coup was led by Christian Malanga, a onetime used car salesman and gold miner who sought to overthrow the country’s president, Félix Tshisekedi. Six people were killed in the coup attempt, parts of which were livestreamed, and Malanga was later shot and killed by the Congolese army while resisting arrest. Zalman-Polun, who pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute marijuana in the United States a decade ago, was reportedly a gold mining business associate of Malanga’s. The other two Americans who were sentenced to death are Marcel Malanga, the son of Christian Malanga, and Tyler Thompson. Zalman-Polun was at the presidential palace before coup leader Christian Malanga was shot dead, according to photos and videos taken that day. Zalman-Polun and the other Americans were caught on the banks of the Congo River as they were trying to escape, according to NPR. They claimed at trial that they were forced to participate in the coup at gunpoint. Zalman-Polun reportedly had been living in South Africa with his family for the past several years. Before that, the family lived in Washington, D.C., where they were members of the Washington Hebrew Congregation, when their first child was born in 2017, according to announcements distributed by the Reform synagogue. Zalman-Polun is now also the target of conspiracy theories that claim he is a CIA and Mossad agent sent to destabilize the Congolese government. Users on X have been sharing a photo of Zalman-Polun and Christian Malanga taken outside of Golan Spy Shop, a technology and security supply store in Tel Aviv, saying that it is proof that they were trained by Israeli forces. Congolese law gives the men five days to appeal their sentences. The country reinstituted the death penalty last year. The U.S. State Department has not declared Zalman-Polun and the other two Americans wrongfully detained, the Associated Press reported, making it unlikely the American government will try to arrange their release. In May, just hours after the attempted coup, U.S. Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo Lucy Tamlyn condemned the coup and the involvement of American citizens. 'I am shocked by the events of this morning and deeply concerned by reports of U.S. citizens allegedly being involved,' Tamlyn wrote on X. 'Please be assured that we will cooperate with DRC authorities to the fullest extent possible as they investigate these criminal acts and hold accountable any U.S. citizens implicated in criminal acts.' Zalman-Polun is not the first Jewish intersection with the DRC’s tumultuous politics. Moise Katumbi, whose father was a Jewish refugee from Greece during the Holocaust, has faced ongoing efforts to block him from running for office, most recently last year when a rival pursued a law that would bar candidates whose parents were not both Congolese; Jewish groups abroad condemned the law as antisemitic. The rival ran against Tshisekedi, the subject of the coup attempt, and received less than 1% of the official vote.

Mossad planted explosives in Hezbollah’s beepers 5 months ago, de...	On Tuesday, at least eleven were killed, and 4,000 people were wounded in Lebanon when beepers exploded simultaneously. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News According to Sky News Arabia, sources report that Mossad ensured explosives were implanted into the pagers and heated them remotely, causing them to detonate. On Tuesday, at least 11 were killed, and 4,000 people were wounded in Lebanon when beepers exploded simultaneously. Most of those killed or injured were Hezbollah terrorists. The report indicates that PETN, a highly explosive material, was implanted in the batteries of the beepers. The weight of the PETN explosives was less than 20 grams, and it is believed they were obtained and implanted 5 months ago. This was possible only through close cooperation with the manufacturer, who must have consented to the supply chain disruption. In an interview with Ma'ariv, Oleg Brodt, Director of Research, Development, and Innovation at Ben-Gurion University's Cyber Labs, explained, 'Many attacks occur by compromising the supply chain. Like a beeper, an electronic device contains numerous components, and each could be infected with malware.' He added, 'This malware could be designed to raise the device’s temperature, cause a malfunction, ignite it, or even trigger an explosion.' Brodt explained, 'In such cases, it’s essential to make the changes to the device without raising suspicion during the quality inspection.' Once implanted on the batteries of the beeper, the explosives were detonated by heating them up remotely. This might have been done using a 'kill switch,' as it is called in the cyber world. The kill switch is software designed to detonate a device at a certain time. It can be set off using a code word or even gibberish. 'It’s possible to set up a non-standard message—something unusual or even gibberish—broadcast to hundreds or thousands of devices simultaneously, causing simultaneous ignition and explosion,' Brodt explained. 'The radio waves the device receives are translated into a unique message that triggers a chain of events leading to the explosion.'

A Reuters journalist saw 10 terrorists bleeding from injuries in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiya, a main stronghold of Hezbollah. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS More than 4,000 Hezbollah terrorists were wounded and at least eleven were killed across Lebanon on Tuesday when their communication devices exploded, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad confirmed. Approximately 200 Hezbollah terrorists were in critical condition in 100 different hospitals, Beirut’s health minister announced about three hours after the explosions were first reported at 3.30 p.m. local time. A Reuters journalist saw 10 terrorists bleeding from injuries in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiya, which is the main stronghold of Hezbollah. A security source told Qatar’s Al Jazeera that explosions occurred across Lebanon—not only in Beirut but also in the Beqaa Valley and the south. Senior Hezbollah officials were said to have been wounded in the blasts. Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also wounded in one of the explosions, Tehran’s semi-official Mehr outlet reported.

Apparently, communication devices on Hezbollah members detonated wounding an unconfirmed number of fighters. pic.twitter.com/e9khfMDLNS &mdash; Joe Truzman (@JoeTruzman) September 17, 2024 Unconfirmed reports in Arab media claimed explosions also occurred in Damascus, wounding at least dozens of Hezbollah terror operatives. In its first official statement on the incident, Hezbollah announced that the pager explosions, 'the causes of which are still unknown,' killed at least three of its members, while wounding a large number of others. Shortly thereafter, the terrorist organization issued a statement that it held the Jewish state 'fully responsible for this criminal aggression.' Lebanese media affiliated with Hezbollah had attributed the incident to the Israel Defense Forces, claiming the mysterious blasts were caused by a hack of the terrorist group’s internal communications networks. The Wall Street Journal said the pagers were part of a new shipment that the terror group received in recent days. A Hezbollah official suggested that 'malware' may have caused the pagers to heat up and explode. Another Hezbollah terrorist official in Lebanon cited by Reuters called the alleged computer hack by Israel the 'biggest security breach so far.' The IDF declined to comment on the incident, which came just hours after the Israeli Cabinet added the return of citizens displaced from their homes in the north to the country’s war goals, bringing a potential major confrontation with Hezbollah closer to reality.

Syria built clandestine atomic reactor, says Israeli nuclear chie...	In March, IAEA director Rafael Grossi visited Syria for talks with Syrian leaders about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s atomic chief warned that Syria has built an undeclared nuclear facility in remarks at the International Atomic Energy Agency’s conference in Vienna on Tuesday. 'Syria, which built an undeclared, clandestine nuclear reactor at Deir al-Zour, optimized for plutonium production, has been in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations for over a decade,' said Moshe Edri, Director General of Israel’s Atomic Energy Commission. 'Syria has recently followed the footsteps of its close ally, Iran, and is pretending to cooperate in good faith with the Agency, while not admitting the full facts, and not providing true answers to the Agency’s questions. The international community should stand behind the IAEA with a goal towards receiving clear, full, explanations from Syria, once and for all.' In March, IAEA director Rafael Grossi visited Syria for talks with Syrian leaders about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It was the first visit by an IAEA official to Syria since 2011 when international nuclear inspectors fled the country during the Syrian Civil War. Grossi’s visit sought to revive an investigation into a nuclear facility at Deir al-Zour destroyed in an Israeli airstrike in 2007. Israel did not confirm responsibility for the airstrike until 2018. Edri also called on the international community to take stronger measures against Iran’s nuclear program. 'Iran continues to be the main source of regional instability, and poses a threat to peace and security worldwide. This reality requires the full attention of the international community, now more than ever before. There is no doubt that Iran conducted a military nuclear program aimed to produce several nuclear weapon devices,' said Edri. An IAEA report in May concluded that Iran possesses a significant stockpile of uranium enriched to more than 60% purity, far higher than the 3.67% necessary for a civilian nuclear program. Nuclear weapons require uranium enriched to 90% purity. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in July that Iran’s breakout time to produce enough weapons-grade material for a nuclear weapon is 'probably one or two weeks.' Said Edri, 'Iran continues to advance this program by gaining relevant technology and knowledge, along with fissile material in alarming amounts. Iran has been conducting covert nuclear activities in undeclared sites for many years. The Agency has found concrete evidence of these activities, including the use of undeclared nuclear material and equipment. Despite repeated resolutions by the Board of Governors, Iran has continuously failed to provide technically credible explanations regarding these activities, and continues to deceive the Agency and the international community.' He added, 'Moreover, Iran continues to develop, test and deploy long-range ballistic missiles, and supports terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East, including the Houthi terrorist group that is a significant security threat to the freedom of navigation, and to the global trade routes. A nuclear-armed Iran, equipped with delivery systems, is not an option that Israel, or the world, can, or should tolerate.'

Federal loopholes allow China to buy land near sensitive ports, l...	Chinese Communist Party-tied companies own at least 384,000 acres of American agricultural land, a 30 percent increase since 2019. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon China and other foreign adversaries are still permitted to purchase U.S. land near sensitive Coast Guard facilities, ports, and Energy Department labs, exposing national security gaps that lawmakers say enable hostile regimes to conduct espionage operations on American soil. The Treasury Department's Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the central body responsible for approving land sales to foreign entities, moved to 'significantly expand' its jurisdiction in July, allowing it to review real estate transactions near 50 military and other sensitive sites. That expanded list, however, does not include locations such as 'national laboratories, maritime ports, and critical telecommunications and energy infrastructure,' all of which remain vulnerable to foreign spy operations, according to Reps. Greg Murphy (R., N.C.) and John Moolenaar (R., Mich.). The oversight, the lawmakers say, reflects 'significant gaps in our national security screening regime for land purchases near national security sites.' Their concern comes as China works to ramp up its influence operations and 'wreak havoc' on American infrastructure, efforts that have made combating Chinese land purchases a major political issue in states across the country. 'Coast Guard facilities, Department of Energy National Labs, among other locations, remain off CFIUS’s list of sensitive sites and are thereby vulnerable to foreign adversary exploitation,' Murphy and Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, wrote in a Monday letter to the Treasury Department. 'These loopholes must be closed, and closed quickly. Allowing our adversaries to have potential access to these sites poses risks to both our economic and national security, especially as we see companies with ties to hostile nations continue to increase their investments in the U.S.' Chinese Communist Party-tied companies own at least 384,000 acres of American agricultural land, a 30 percent increase since 2019, though poor federal oversight means the number could be higher. This accounts for nearly $2 billion in holdings, planting Beijing and its interests across the American heartland. Lawmakers from both parties have been sounding the alarm about CCP land purchases for some time, leading CFIUS and other federal agencies to more stringently police Beijing’s land acquisition near some military sites. But as the Treasury Department finalizes its new rule to extend CFIUS’s blacklist to include 50 military installations across 30 states, Murphy and Moolenaar say more must be done to address several critical loopholes. 'Because CFIUS land purchase regulations are not retroactive, land purchases made prior to a site being listed are exempt from CFIUS review,' the lawmakers noted in their letter. Even if federal authorities move forward with expanded restrictions, China’s past land purchases would be immune from scrutiny. 'Xi Jinping would never allow Americans to buy land next to sensitive Chinese bases,' Moolenaar told the Washington Free Beacon. 'Unfortunately, current U.S. policy all too often rolls out the red carpet for CCP land purchases.' CFIUS is not currently examining any restrictions on China’s land purchases near Coast Guard hubs and Energy Department labs, giving the CCP room to pivot to these sites as the American government focuses on restricting land buys near military installations. Murphy and Moolenaar say there is a solid 'national security case for including Coast Guard and other facilities' in CFIUS’s blacklist, given the Coast Guard's chief role in policing America’s maritime boundaries. In June, for instance, several Russian ships sailed within 30 miles of the coast of Florida, prompting the Coast Guard to monitor these activities. A month later, Chinese military ships entered the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone off the coast of Alaska, again drawing a response from the Coast Guard. If Chinese entities owned land near Coast Guard facilities, they could potentially surveil the Coast Guard’s response to national security situations and gain valuable information about how the United States monitors its borders. 'While CFIUS coverage includes many military bases and other sensitive areas, U.S. Coast Guard facilities, National Laboratories, some maritime ports, and critical telecommunications and energy infrastructure are not included,' Murphy told the Free Beacon. 'This leaves the United States vulnerable to hostile nations and malicious actors. We cannot allow bad actors to purchase land in America to harm us.'

'The terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip continue to systematically abuse civilian and humanitarian infrastructure to carry out terrorist activities and attacks on Israeli civilians,' the IDF statement concluded. 'The IDF will continue to operate against the terrorist organizations in defense of the State of Israel.' Soldier seriously wounded A reserve soldier in the IDF’s 846th Battalion, Givati Brigade, was seriously wounded during combat operations in the southern Gaza Strip, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said on Tuesday morning. He was evacuated to a hospital for treatment and his family was notified. IDF’s 5th Brigade deployed to Gaza’s Netzarim Corridor The Israel Defense Forces’ 5th Infantry Brigade has been stationed in the Netzarim Corridor that splits the Gaza Strip between north and south, the army announced on Monday. It is the second time the brigade has operated in the coastal enclave since Israeli forces entered the territory on Oct. 27. The brigade’s first tour of duty entailed protecting Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip in the first days of the war and ridding them of terrorists, before months of combat in the areas of Beit Hanun, Kherbat Ahzaa and the central corridor. The brigade falls under the command of the 252nd Division, which in recent months has been operating against Hamas and working to expand the axis dividing the northern and southern Strip. 'In the last few days, the brigade’s fighters completed a series of training and exercises at the Ground Forces Training Center (GTC). The forces carried out training and exercises in warfare in open and built-up areas and raised their operational competence in preparation for their mission in the center of the Gaza Strip,' the IDF said. 'In addition, the forces completed logistical preparation and held mobility, supplies and immediate medical response training in preparation for the fighting.'

Hezbollah plot to assassinate former Israeli security chief foile...	The Lebanese terror group had planned to bomb a former Israeli security official using a Claymore mine. By World Israel News Staff The Iran-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah plotted to assassinate a former senior Israeli security official using an anti-personnel mine, the Shin Bet internal security agency revealed Tuesday. The Shin Bet announced Tuesday afternoon that a former senior Israeli security official, whose identity remains barred from publication, was to have been targeted by Hezbollah terrorists in the next few days, using a remotely-detonated Claymore mine. 'As part of an operation by the General Security Service, a bomb attack on behalf of Hezbollah was foiled, which was targeted against a former senior official in the security system and was planned to be carried out in the coming days,' the Shin Bet said. According to the Shin Bet, the explosive device was linked to a cellular phone, allowing the bomb's handlers in Lebanon to observe when the target approached the mine and then detonate it remotely. The bomb was similar to another explosive device found in Hayarkon Park last September, planted as part of another Hezbollah plot to kill an Israeli official. Shin Bet officials believe that the same Hezbollah cell is behind both failed bombing attempts. 'Operational preparation and the activity of the forces prevented the attack in the final stages of implementation,' the Shin Bet said. 'The target of the attack has been updated by the security forces and is being updated accordingly.' 'The Shin Bet, together with its partners in the security system, will increase and operate with all the capabilities available to it to monitor and thwart Hezbollah's terrorist activities.' Six months before the Hayarkon Park bombing attempt, Hezbollah terrorists infiltrated into northern Israel and placed a bomb near Megiddo Junction, seirously injuring the driver of a passing vehicle.

‘World cannot tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran,’ warns top nuclear o...	Director-General of Israel's nuclear commission warns Iran still evading IAEA scrutiny, using undeclared nuclear materials. By World Israel News Staff Israel's top nuclear official warned the International Atomic Energy Agency Tuesday not to permit Iran to acquire nuclear weapons, saying that complacency vis-a-vis a nuclear-armed Iran is 'not an option' for the world. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Director General Moshe Edri addressed the 68th International Atomic Energy (IAEA) General Conference in Vienna on Tuesday, and commented on the regional challenges facing the State of Israel, highlighting both Iran and Syria, both of which he accused of not honoring their international commitments in this field. Edri emphasized that Iran's nuclear program, which continues to evade full scrutiny by the IAEA, poses a threat not only to Israel but to global stability. 'Iran continues to be the main source of regional instability, and poses a threat to peace and security worldwide. This reality requires the full attention of the international community, now more than ever before.' 'There is no doubt that Iran conducted a military nuclear program aimed to produce several nuclear weapon devices. Iran continues to advance this program by gaining relevant technology and knowledge, along with fissile material in alarming amounts.' Edri noted that Tehran has thus far flouted IAEA requirements, operating secret nuclear facilities while refusing to provide an honest accounting of its nuclear activities. 'Iran has been conducting covert nuclear activities in undeclared sites for many years. The Agency has found concrete evidence of these activities, including the use of undeclared nuclear material and equipment.' 'Despite repeated resolutions by the Board of Governors, Iran has continuously failed to provide technically credible explanations regarding these activities, and continues to deceive the Agency and the international community.' Most egregiously, Edri added, the Iranian government continues to develop and produce ballistic missiles clearly intended to serve as delivery mechanisms for nuclear weapons. 'Moreover, Iran continues to develop, test and deploy long-range ballistic missiles, and supports terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East, including the Houthi terrorist group that is a significant security threat to the freedom of navigation, and to the global trade routes.

Britain to mandate Holocaust education, says PM	British PM Keir Starmer says his government will require all schools to include Holocaust education, citing Hamas October 7th invasion of Israel and subsequent surge in antisemitism as proof of need for curriculum change. By World Israel News Staff Every school in Britain will be required to include Holocaust education in its curriculum, Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged Monday. Speaking during the annual Holocaust Education Trust dinner in London Monday evening, Starmer warned of rising antisemitism in Britain, and vowed to combat the growing trend, comparing it to his efforts to push back on anti-Jewish bigotry within the Labour Party. The event, which drew some 500 attendees, featured British Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, and a number of Holocaust survivors and their families. 'Just as I fought to bring my party back from the abyss of antisemitism, I will do the same in leading the country,' Starmer said. Under the new national curriculum standards being set by the government, Starmer said, British students will hear recorded testimonials from Holocaust survivors. 'Even schools who do not currently have to follow the national curriculum will have to teach the Holocaust when the new curriculum comes in,' Starmer continued. 'For the first time, studying the Holocaust will become a critical, vital part of every single student’s identity. And not just studying it, learning from it too and above all, acting on its lessons.' Starmer said that the surge in antisemitism following the October 7th invasion of Israel demonstrated the dire need for changes to the school curriculum to combat anti-Jewish sentiments. 'Over 1,000 people were massacred by Hamas, for the very same reason: because they were Jewish.' 'We say ‘never again’ and yet in the last year we’ve seen record levels of antisemitism right here in Britain.' Starmer condemned the overt antisemitism displayed at some anti-Israel rallies since October 7th, warning that it was a sign of 'hatred marching on our streets.'

‘Nothing justifies’ Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas, says UN S...	Secretary-General Antonio Guterres claims devastation of Gaza during war against Hamas constitutes 'collective punishment,' calling it unparalleled in recent history. By World Israel News Staff The secretary-general of the United Nations accused Israel of carrying out 'collective punishment' against Palestinian Arabs living in the Gaza Strip, saying 'nothing justifies' the way the current war against the Hamas terror organization is being waged. Speaking with AFP on Monday, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7th and the taking of over 250 hostages, but added that not even Hamas atrocities justify Israel's current war in Gaza. 'It is unimaginable, the level of suffering in Gaza, the level of deaths and destruction have no parallel in everything I've witnessed since [becoming] Secretary-General,' Guterres said Monday. 'We all condemn the terror attacks made by Hamas, as well as the taking of the hostages, that is an absolute violation of international humanitarian law.' 'But the truth is that nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, and that is what we are witnessing in a dramatic way in Gaza.' 'Accountability should be a must,' Guterres said regarding collateral damage, saying both Israel and Hamas were guilty of 'serious violations.' Turning to efforts to reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Guterres lamented that the talks 'are endless,' adding that it would be 'very difficult' to achieve a breakthrough. Guterres has frequently criticized Israel over its handling of the war in Gaza. Last week, the Secretary-General blasted the IDF after the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) claimed that six of its employees were killed in a pair of Israeli airstrikes in the city of Nuseirat in central Gaza. 'What’s happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable,' Guterres tweeted. 'A school turned shelter for around 12,000 people was hit by Israeli airstrikes again today.' 'Six of our UNRWA colleagues are among those killed. These dramatic violations of international humanitarian law need to stop now.' Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, fired back, noting UNRWA’s extensive links to terrorist groups, including Hamas, and suggesting the six UNRWA employees killed were themselves terrorists. 'What is ‘unacceptable,’ Antonio Guterres, is the fact you refuse to recognize reality and continue to distort it,' tweeted Danon. 'Terrorists operating out of civilian buildings previously used by UNRWA are not ‘innocent.’ It is unconscionable that the UN continues to condemn Israel in its just war against terrorists, while Hamas continues to use women and children as human shields.'

Blinken heads to Egypt for talks on Israeli control of Philadelph...	Most of the holdup in a potential hostage deal allegedly centers around control of the Gaza-Egypt border, which has been Hamas’ weapons pipeline and is now in Israel’s hands. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is coming to Egypt Tuesday to hold discussions on the one of the main issues holding up a hostage deal with Hamas – control over the Philadelphi Corridor, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Citing 'an official in the region,' the report said that Blinken’s trip is being made 'to reassure Israel over its concerns that Hamas can smuggle weapons across' the Egyptian-Gazan border, which the IDF and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have called Hamas’ oxygen pipeline in terms of military resupply. Since taking the Corridor over several months ago, the Israeli army has discovered – and blown up – dozens of smuggling tunnels running from the Egyptian side into the Gazan city of Rafah, some large enough for trucks that can carry missiles as well as tons of cement for terror tunnel construction. Netanyahu has declared that Israel must control this nine-mile-long line or else Hamas will easily rearm, rebuild, and become a new 'existential' threat to the Jewish state within a few years’ time. Most of the Israeli public agrees that holding the Corridor is of utmost importance to Israel's security. Hamas refuses to sign off on a hostages-for-ceasefire-and-prisoners agreement unless the IDF withdraws, both from the southern line and the Netzarim Corridor that the army built in central Gaza that stretches to the Mediterranean Sea in order to cut the Strip in half. Although Cairo is considered by the U.S. to be a faithful mediator in the hostage talks, it has sided with Hamas in strenuously opposing an Israeli presence on its border with Gaza. Egypt has not acknowledged its total failure to prevent the wholesale Palestinian smuggling that is considered the main reason Hamas could become a major and immediate security threat to Israel, as it proved on October 7, when the terrorist organization led an invasion in which they and other Gazans massacred 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians. The paper pointed out that Blinken’s visit follows last week’s announcement that the U.S. would be providing Egypt with its full annual military aid package of $1.3 billion, overruling a Congressional directive that conditioned some of the funding on Cairo improving its human rights record, which is still considered deplorable by experts in the field. A State Department spokesperson said that the decision to restore the last $320 million of the package was 'important to advancing regional peace and Egypt’s specific and ongoing contributions to U.S. national security priorities, particularly to finalize a ceasefire agreement for Gaza' and help end the Israel-Hamas war. It is unknown whether Blinken will tie the Americans’ generosity to a request that Egypt soften its stance on the Philadelphi Corridor and persuade Hamas to do so as well, in order to get a deal done that will see the release of at least some of the live hostages still remaining in Hamas captivity over 11 months after they were abducted. President Joe Biden has repeatedly stated that freeing the hostages remains one of his top priorities. The ceasefire that would be part of the deal would also seemingly stop a possible Israel-Hezbollah war, as the Lebanese Shiite terrorists have said they would stop their constant rocket attacks on Israel if the fighting stops in Gaza. Jerusalem has made increasingly threatening noises in recent days to restore quiet in its northern region by invading Lebanon to push Hezbollah away from the border, as 60,000 Israelis are still evacuated from their homes for their safety, an untenable position for any government. Blinken’s trip to Cairo is in accord with the U.S. position that diplomatic means can prevent such a war, which it fears could turn into a wider, regional conflict that includes Hezbollah’s master, Iran.

Inside IDF’s plans for tech-heavy border fence on Jordanian front...	Installing hundreds of monitoring devices and the establishment of a new Eastern Command are parts of the first phase of the project. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF has developed a detailed plan for fully safeguarding the Jordanian border and will present it to the Finance and Defense ministries in the coming days for funding approval, Ynet reported Tuesday. In the first, immediate phase of the plan, hundreds of monitoring and observation instruments will be placed along a 400-kilometer stretch from Eilat to Hamat Gader at the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee. The radars and cameras will be installed on high poles, to detect illicit attempts to cross the border either by terrorists or smugglers. When such an attempt is detected, fast mobile forces will be sent to the suspicious area. It is 'possible,' said the report, that some soldiers will use gliders or other airborne vehicles to arrive and attack quickly. An upgraded physical barrier is also included in the plan, as currently there is nothing blocking the border in the entire desert (Arava) area, and in other places, such as the Jordan Valley, the barrier consists only of a decades-old, rusty and low fence. The formation of a completely new, Eastern division that will guard Israel’s longest land border is also in the works. A unique element in the plan is to have one of the brigades in the division consist of ultra-Orthodox men serving in the Jordan Valley, which would put them in close proximity to their yeshivas (learning institutions) in the Jerusalem area. This single, unified Command would ostensibly be more effective than the current situation, where a mix of reservist and regular battalions belonging to two different Commands – Southern and Central – rotate in and out of various domains along the border. The estimated cost of the project is somewhere between the NIS2.5 billion invested in the high fences strewn with technological means of detection along the Egyptian border that stopped the infiltration of tens of thousands of illegal migrants, and the NIS4 billion barrier down the length of the Gaza Strip, which was built both above and below the ground in order to stop terror tunnels from crossing into Israel. While the Gaza barrier was largely successful in stopping smuggling attempts, criminals make constant runs at the 220km-long Sinai fence, with the IDF acknowledging that has not been able to stop a majority of them, due to the sparseness of its forces there. Most, but not all, of the southern gangs are running drugs, not guns. The Jordanian border, however, has recently become a huge conduit for all kinds of weapons, including advanced rifles and explosives. According to the report, the 'regular' smuggling routes have been taken over by the Iranian Quds Force, which is eager to turn Judea and Samaria into a serious terror challenge for Israel as well as a real threat to take over the Palestinian Authority. The explosives in particular are a worry for the IDF, as the Palestinians in such terror centers as Jenin have mastered the tactic of planting bombs along and underneath streets where they expect IDF forces to travel, and they are much more powerful and deadly than the homemade, fertilizer-based ones of the past. Over the last three years, the army and police have stepped up their anti-smuggling operations, and hundreds of attempts have been foiled, with the confiscation of thousands of weapons. 'But for every such thwarting, there are at least three to five smuggling operations that are successful, and we don't know about them,' one security official said.

‘This is madness’ – US furious over Netanyahu plan to fire defens...	Biden administration furious over potential cabinet shake-up, says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'would be crazy' to replace Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration is furious over an expected move by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant - with whom he has repeatedly butted heads - and replace him with New Hope party chairman Gideon Saa'ar. 'Replacing a defense minister during a war for political reasons is an act of madness, especially when it's a defense minister with military experience,' a senior American diplomat fumed to Hebrew-language news outlet Channel 12 on Monday, following reports about the likely change in Netanyahu's cabinet. Another Biden administration official told Axios that Netanyahu 'would be crazy' to replace 'an experienced minister of defense like Gallant amid a war in Gaza and as Israel might be heading towards a possible all out war in Lebanon.' Former defense minister Benny Gantz also lashed out against Netanyahu regarding the anticipated move, saying at a conference on Tuesday morning that the premier is 'endangering Israel’s security during a war.' The Biden administration has enjoyed a close relationship with Gallant, whom they felt was a counterweight to more hawkish political leaders in Netanyahu's coalition, such as Public Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir of the Otzma Yehudit party. Washington likely views Gallant being replaced as another step towards a large-scale military confrontation with Hezbollah, following an announcement that the return of displaced northerners to their homes has officially been added as a goal for the ongoing war. The U.S. has been intensely pressuring Israel to refrain from launching a high intensity military campaign against the Lebanon-based terror group until after the November presidential elections. But according to a Channel 12 report, both the political and defense establishments feel that the tit-for-tat attacks which have defined much of the fighting with Hezbollah over the past 11 months aren't sufficient for deterring the terror group, and that the chances of a diplomatic solution to the conflict are slim.

‘Is this guy part of a conspiracy?’ Florida Sheriff questions whe...	The former president’s golf schedule had not been publicly disclosed. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon A Florida sheriff is raising questions about whether the attempted assassination of Donald Trump is part of a broader conspiracy. The sheriff, William Snyder of Martin County, Fla., noted that the would-be assassin is not a Florida resident and that the former president's movements on Sunday were not broadcast in advance. 'How does a guy from not here get all the way to Trump International, realize that the president, former president of the United States, is golfing, and is able to get a rifle in that vicinity?' Snyder said Monday. The former president’s golf schedule had not been publicly disclosed. 'I think that’s the question the FBI, the Secret Service are laser-focused on today. Is this guy part of a conspiracy? Is he a lone gunman?' Snyder continued. 'If he’s part of a conspiracy, then this whole thing really takes on a very ominous tone.' The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, allegedly camped at Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course with food, a digital camera, and a loaded rifle with a scope for around 12 hours before the Secret Service spotted him, according to cell phone data obtained by authorities. A Secret Service agent opened fire after noticing the muzzle of a rifle protruding from shrubbery about 400 yards from where Trump was playing. The suspect fled in a vehicle but was apprehended in less than an hour. The incident follows a similar security lapse two months ago, when 20-year-old Thomas Crooks evaded Secret Service detection for at least 20 minutes and nearly assassinated Trump at a July 13 rally in Pennsylvania. Routh, charged Monday with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, appeared to smile and laugh at least three times while speaking to his attorney before the hearing began, Fox News reported. The charges carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. The post 'Is this guy part of a conspiracy?'

Israel returns body of Allenby Crossing terrorist to Jordan	Israeli officials have not commented on the return of al-Jazi’s body. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel returned the body of a Jordanian national who killed three Israelis in a terror attack at a border crossing, Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on Tuesday morning. The terrorist, 39-year-old Maher Diab al-Jazi, shot and killed three Israelis at the Allenby border crossing, near Jericho, after approaching the cargo area in a truck from the Jordanian side. He exited the vehicle during an inspection and began firing at guards, who returned fire, killing Al-Jazi. Following the attack, Israel temporarily closed its three other land crossings. Israeli officials have not commented on the return of al-Jazi’s body. The Allenby crossing is primarily used by Palestinians in Judea and Samaria to travel to Jordan. Israeli travelers use border crossings in Eilat and the northern Jordan Valley. The victims were identified as Yohanan Shahouri, a 61-year-old father of six from Ma’ale Efraim, 65-year-old Yuri Birnbaum, of Moshav Naama near Jericho, and Adrian Marcelo Podmesser, a resident of Ariel. All three worked at the crossing. Approximately 70% of the Jordanian population is Palestinian, and Hamas enjoys wide popularity. However, the terror group’s alignment with Iran makes its relations with Amman tense. Since the start of the Gaza war, a surge of anti-Israel protests has erupted across Jordan, especially in the capital Amman and other major cities. Ordinary Jordanians celebrated the attack with fireworks and distributing sweets.

Courts: Judea and Samaria towns cannot bar Palestinian workers	Before the war, some 200,000 Palestinian workers were employed throughout the Jewish state, including 30,000 in Judea and Samaria. By JNS Elected local officials in Israeli communities throughout Judea and Samaria do not have the legal right to block Palestinian laborers from entering their communities if the military allows their employment, Israeli courts have confirmed in a series of recent cases, Israel Hayom reported on Sunday. In a case brought by a group of Arab workers against the city of Efrat in Judea’s Gush Etzion region, a judge ruled that the municipality’s blanket ban on the entry of Palestinian Authority residents was illegal. 'Starting next Tuesday, in accordance with the army’s decision and the court ruling, construction workers will resume their activities within Efrat,' Mayor Dovi Shefler said in a message to residents last week. In a conversation with Israel Hayom on Monday, Shefler noted that the court ruled that local officials in Judea and Samaria 'do not have the authority to make the military’s instructions stricter.' Srugim, an Israeli news site catering to the religious Zionist community, reported that at least three other towns received similar rulings in recent months. A settlement reached in a Jerusalem court some five months ago following litigation between the town of Ma’ale Efrayim in the Jordan Valley and four construction companies likewise stated that the IDF would have the final say regarding the admission of P.A. laborers. While the military banned Palestinians from working in Jewish towns throughout Judea and Samaria in the initial months following Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre, Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fox, the then-head of the IDF Central Command, in late 2023 lifted the access restrictions for industrial zones. During the court proceedings, attorneys representing four development companies argued that Ma’ale Efrayim should allow P.A. workers to enter again, claiming that the IDF decision regarding industrial zones should also apply to construction sites in the town’s new neighborhood. Last week, Knesset member Zvi Sukkot (Religious Zionism Party), in a letter to the IDF demanded that the military cancel its policy, noting it forces communities to let in workers despite security concerns. 'The communities must admit Palestinian laborers, even if they express explicit opposition to their entry,' Sukkot noted in a letter to IDF Central Command head Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth. 'Palestinians are banned from entering inside the Green Line due to the security threat; in Judea and Samaria, they have to let them in, even if the communities oppose it.' Before the war, some 200,000 Palestinian workers were employed throughout the Jewish state, including 30,000 in Judea and Samaria. Two surveys last year found that some two-thirds of Palestinians in Judea and Samaria support the Oct. 7 attacks, in which around 6,000 Hamas-led terrorists broke through the Gaza border, murdered some 1,200 people, wounded thousands more and took more than 250 captive. Plans to readmit Palestinians to Jewish communities have been met with dismay by many Israelis. A poll taken in Eli, a town of some 4,500 inhabitants in the Binyamin region of Samaria, showed that 82% of residents oppose their entry, regardless of added security measures.

‘Israel needs to change’ – Biden admin. hits IDF over killing of ...	Preliminary investigation into the killing of a Turkish-American activist during a riot in Samaria 'does not exonerate' IDF soldiers, says State Department, demanding Israel 'change its policies' for use of force. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration chided the Israeli military Monday over civilian deaths in the ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and over the death of a dual Turkish-American citizen during a riot in Samaria. Speaking with reporters during a press briefing on Monday, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Israel's military must tighten its rules of engagement and policies on the use of force, citing the deaths of humanitarian aid workers in the Gaza Strip as a result of a mistaken IDF airstrike, and the fatal shooting of 26-year-old Turkish-born International Solidarity Movement (ISM) activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi. Eygi was fatally wounded during a Palestinian Arab riot in the town of Beita, south of Nablus (Shechem) in Samaria on September 7th. The IDF has acknowledged that Eygi was likely killed by 'indirect and unintended IDF fire which was aimed at a main instigator' of the riots. During Monday's press briefing, Miller downplayed a preliminary investigation into the shooting, saying the Biden administration did not view its results as exonerating the IDF soldiers involved. 'You look at the initial findings and they already tell you that something went tragically wrong and you had the killing of an American citizen that never should have occurred,' Miller said. 'So when I hear people hold&#8230; the initial findings up as if they somehow exonerated Israeli security forces, they very much do not. And at least in our point of view they very much do not exonerate them. They reveal the need for a number of changes, and we have made clear that’s what needs to happen.' Miller repeatedly called on Israel to change its use of force regulations, noting that the administration has already pressed Jerusalem on the issue. 'Israel needs to change its policies, and we have made that quite clear,' Miller continued, before referencing the April 1st IDF drone strike which hit an aid convoy in Gaza, killing seven aid workers from the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen organization. 'When it comes to the World Central Kitchen strike we made clear that they need to change their deconfliction measures and worked with the UN to get new deconfliction measures in place. Now, those aren’t perfect. We continue to see strikes that result in the death of humanitarian workers; continue to see strikes in Gaza that lead to the tragic, tragic deaths of civilians.' Gaza 'is a very difficult place in which to conduct a military campaign because you have a terrorist organization that embeds itself and hides itself behind civilians, which is why it’s the United States that is at the forefront of pushing for a ceasefire. And when it comes to actions in the West Bank, it’s the – why it’s the United States that’s pushing for changes to the – to Israeli rules of engagement.'

Return of displaced northerners officially declared a war goal	Netanyahu tells U.S. official that while Israel appreciates American support, it will 'do what is necessary' to safeguard citizens, security of the state. By World Israel News Staff Israel appeared to take an additional step towards launching an intensive military campaign against Hezbollah, as the national security cabinet announced that the return of evacuated residents of the north as an official goal for the ongoing war. Following the October 7th terror onslaught, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defined the aims of the war as returning all of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas, dismantling Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and ensuring that the terror group never again poses a security threat to the Jewish State. Ensuring the safe return of those forced from their homes near the border with Lebanon has now been added to the list of war objectives, as Israeli officials signal that the IDF is preparing for a large-scale offensive against Hezbollah. Since October 8th, Hezbollah has launched near-daily salvos on northern Israeli communities and military assets. The barrages of rockets, missiles, and explosive drones forced the evacuation of at least 60,000 Israelis from their homes adjacent to the Lebanese border. Tens of thousands of northerners, who were not displaced, have been living under the constant threat of Hezbollah aggression for almost a year. The U.S. has been intensely pressuring Israel to hold off on the campaign until after the November presidential elections, according to Hebrew-language media reports. However, it's unclear if Israel will abide by that timeline. The Biden administration's special envoy to the Middle East, Amos Hochstein, traveled to Israel on Monday and met with several Israeli officials, including Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, in what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to persuade Israel to avoid decisive military action. 'The Prime Minister made it very clear that it will not be possible to return our residents without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north,' read a summary of the meeting published by the premier's office. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu said that while Israel appreciates and respects the support of the U.S., it will – ultimately – do what is necessary to safeguard its security and return the residents of the north securely to their homes.'

Netanyahu to address UN amid rising Middle East tensions	Netanyahu’s speech is expected to touch on the Abraham Accords and prospects for further peace deals, possibly hinting at progress with Saudi Arabia. By Jewish Breaking News Amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will address the United Nations General Assembly next week. He will depart for New York next Tuesday to meet with world leaders on the sidelines of the assembly followed by his address on Friday afternoon. Netanyahu’s 11th appearance at the UN comes as the Palestinian Authority is pushing for sweeping measures against Israel, including calls for an arms embargo and sanctions. A draft resolution circulated by the PA urges Israel to withdraw from Judea and Samaria within six months and calls for the removal of approximately 500,000 Israeli citizens living in these territories. In response, Foreign Minister Israel Katz has instructed his team to prepare retaliatory measures if the PA violates the Oslo Accords. These reportedly range from freezing funds to cutting security ties with Ramallah. While the exact content of Netanyahu’s speech remains to be seen, it’s likely to cover several key areas. Besides outlining Israel’s historical right to Judea and Samaria, the Prime Minister will likely provide updates on Israel’s humanitarian efforts in Gaza as well as its efforts in dismantling Iran’s regional terror proxies. As in previous years, Netanyahu’s speech is expected to touch on the Abraham Accords and prospects for further peace deals, possibly hinting at progress with Saudi Arabia. Israeli technological innovations in fields like water conservation, agriculture, and medicine are expected to be highlighted as well.

War in Gaza fuels surge in psychiatric drug prescriptions	Southern Israeli communities experienced a 33% increase in antidepressant use and a 25% rise in sleeping pill consumption. By Jewish Breaking News A concerning new study highlights a significant increase in psychiatric drug use in Israel since the start of the war in Gaza. Presented at the Israeli Society for Quality in Medicine’s annual meeting in Tel Aviv on Sunday, the research from the Meir Medical Center reveals a 50% increase in anti-anxiety medication purchases and a tripling of narcotic pain reliever acquisitions among the general population. Among the southern Israeli communities hit the hardest on October 7 by Hamas’ brutal massacre, the crisis is even more pronounced with a 200% increase in anti-anxiety drug purchases and a 250% rise in narcotic pain reliever use. These areas also experienced a 33% increase in antidepressant use and a 25% rise in sleeping pill consumption. Research leader Dr. Hornik-Lurie of Meir warns that urgent action is needed to prevent addiction, especially among high-risk groups. 'The risk factors for the consumption of all four families of drugs after October 7th are older age, living in the Gaza Envelope on October 7th, living in a peripheral area, and being female,'she explains. 'We observed an alarming increase in the consumption of anti-anxiety drugs and a spike in the use of narcotic pain relievers after the outbreak of the war. We suggest conducting further studies that will examine the long-term effects of the war on the entire population and the residents of the surrounding area, in particular.'

US trade with Iran jumped last year as Tehran wreaked havoc acros...	The United States has repeatedly bypassed sanctions to help Iran access upwards of $100 billion in cash resources, money that lawmakers say is fueling Tehran’s aggression in the Middle East. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon American trade with Iran jumped 43 percent last year, reaching more than $81 million at a time when Tehran’s hardline regime ramped up its terrorist efforts and wreaked havoc across the Middle East, according to a non-public State Department report provided to Congress and reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon. The significant jump in trade relations suggests the Biden-Harris administration is bypassing tough American sanctions on Tehran in order to stimulate its flagging economy and provide the hardline regime with a financial lifeline. The United States imported $22.3 million in goods from Iran in 2023 and exported $59 million, accounting for $81.3 million in total trade between the countries, according to the State Department report, which was submitted to Congress earlier this week. Overall trade between the United States and Iran rose by more than $24 million from 2022 to 2023, marking a 43 percent increase, according to figures published in the report. At the same time, Iranian trade with China, one of its closest allies, fell by 7 percent over the same period, indicating the Biden-Harris administration is picking up some of the slack. The report also omitted statistics on Russia’s trade with Iran, with the State Department saying these figures could not be produced. The report, which is unclassified but not disseminated publicly, is driving concerns on Capitol Hill, with GOP critics seeing it as further evidence of the Biden-Harris administration’s bid to boost diplomacy with Tehran as it wages a multi-front war on Israel. The United States has repeatedly bypassed sanctions to help Iran access upwards of $100 billion in cash resources, money that lawmakers say is fueling Tehran’s aggression in the Middle East, including Iran-backed terror group Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish state. 'It’s no surprise that the Iranian regime was able to engage and pay for increased trade with the U.S., and to bolster their economy more broadly,' Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the Free Beacon. 'Indeed, regime outlets have been bragging that trade with the U.S. has doubled again in the first quarter of 2024. Iran then uses their financial and economic strength to conduct terrorism around the world, including terrorism directly targeting Americans.' U.S. trade with Iran primarily consists of 'agricultural goods, medicine, and medical devices,' according to a footnote in the State Department’s report. These exports are facilitated through licenses granted under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, which eased trade restrictions on humanitarian goods. Imports from Iran are allowed by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which has the power to waive certain sanctions for national security reasons. The State Department declined to comment on its findings and would not provide further information about the nature of U.S. trade with Iran, including exactly what goods are being exchanged. A State Department official directed the Free Beacon to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, but they did not respond to a request for comment with similar questions. In addition to the United States, Iranian trade with the United Kingdom jumped by 66 percent from 2022 to 2023. This includes $116 million in imports from Iran and $76 million in exports, according to the report, which does not detail exactly what goods are being exchanged. 'Since the last reporting period,' the State Department wrote, 'overall G20 trade with Iran decreased 14 percent, representing a $5 billion decrease.' The increase in trade between the United States and United Kingdom appeared to be an outlier from the overall trend in 2023. Additionally, 'Saudi Arabia nearly quadrupled its trade with Iran from $5 million to $24.8 million,' indicating the historically chilly relationship between the two regional powers is thawing in some respects. While Iran’s trade with China fell slightly from 2022 to 2023, it still 'makes up 48 percent of Iran’s trade with the G20,' according to the report. Republicans such as Cruz say the findings suggest the United States is easing its trade embargo on Iran. 'The Biden-Harris administration has done everything they can to flood the Ayatollah with cash and facilitate the regime’s ability to finance terrorism,' the senator said. 'They’ve refused to enforce sanctions, waived other sanctions, and worked with banks around the world to free up and transfer Iranian assets.' Iran’s oil revenues, a key source of cash for the regime, have topped more than $90 billion since the Biden-Harris administration came to power and began easing sanctions on Tehran’s energy sector. The administration has also repeatedly issued a sanctions waiver that permits Iraq to pay Iran for electricity imports representing around $10 billion for the regime. It is believed this cash helps Tehran finance its regional terror proxies, including Hamas and Hezbollah, which are both still waging war on Israel.

Germany not barring arms sales to Israel, says lawmaker	Member of German parliament denies report claiming Berlin has imposed de facto arms embargo on Israel. By World Israel News Staff A recent report accusing the German government of imposing a de facto arms embargo on Israel was false, a member of the German national parliament claimed Monday. Over the weekend, Germany's Bilt newspaper reported that Berlin has consistently refused to permit weapons sales to Israel, or responded to requests for arms export permits with indefinite delays, effectively blocking new weapons sales to the Jewish state. For instance, an IDF request for an export permit enabling it to purchase thousands of tank shells has simply been ignored by Berlin thus far, the report claimed. 'The growing concerns are the reason why fewer approvals are being granted, even if no one wants to say it out loud,' an official working fora representative on the German Federal Security Council told Profil Magazine. As a result, weapons sales to Israel have plummeted this year, dropping from 300 million Euros in 2023 to just 14 million in 2024. A conservative lawmaker in the German Bundestag, however, denied the report, telling Israel Hayom that after looking into the report's claims, he found no evidence of a deliberate effort to prevent arms sales to Israel. 'After consulting with my office, we have no knowledge of any companies being denied security export licenses to Israel,' Klaus-Peter Willsch, a member of the center-right Christian Democratic Union said during a trip to Israel Monday. Willsch said he backed arms sales to Israel, comparing support for Israel against Hamas to Germany's support for Ukraine in its ongoing war against Russia. 'I endorse exports to Israel, just as I support exports to Ukraine. Both hold significant importance.'

Netanyahu poised to fire Defense Minister Gallant and replace him...	Sources close to the prime minister say he is on the verge of firing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and is preparing to bring in a party from the Opposition to bolster his government. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to dismiss Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud) from his government, and bring in a party from the Opposition to bolster the Coalition, Kan Hadashot reported Monday. Citing an official in the Prime Minister's Office, the report claimed that Netanyahu is prepared to fire Gallant 'within a short time,' as talks progress between the ruling Likud party and the New Hope. Members of Netanyahu's inner circle are reportedly nearing an agreement with New Hope chief and former Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar to bring the four-MK faction into the government, expanding its narrow majority. Sa'ar, a former member of the Likud and longtime rival of Netanyahu, bolted the Likud in 2020 to form the New Hope party, which later formed an alliance with Benny Gantz's Blue and White party. The talks, which reportedly continued through the night from Sunday to Monday, are being brokered by Justice Minister Yariv Levin (Likud), a figure relied upon by both Sa'ar and Netanyahu. The inclusion of the New Hope faction in the government would better position Netanyahu to pass a new proposed draft law, reinstating draft deferments for full-time yeshiva students over the objections of Gallant and several other Likud faction members. Netanyahu is under growing pressure to pass the bill, mollifying his ultra-Orthodox allies Shas and United Torah Judaism, and potentially ending a political crisis caused by the Supreme Court's striking down of the previous draft law in 2017. On June 25th, the Supreme Court handed down a precedent-setting ruling ordering the army to immediately draft 3,000 ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students who had hitherto benefited from the long-running draft deferment policy, which has offered annual exemptions to full-time yeshiva students. After multiple extensions of the 2015 law, which was struck down by the court in 2017, Supreme Court justices ruled unanimously that the no more extensions would be granted and that the government must work with the military to draft thousands of ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students and end social benefits to families of those who refuse to appear at draft centers. Ultra-Orthodox lawmakers have demanded the government pass a new law largely restoring the status quo ante, while Defense Minister Gallant and several other Likud members have called for major changes to the draft deferment system. Over the past few weeks, Shas and UTJ have threatened to topple the government if the issue is not addressed. Netanyahu is also reportedly frustrated with Gallant's handling of the war in Gaza and the ongoing conflict on Israel's northern border. The prime minister, according to sources close to Netanyahu cited in a report by Kan Hadashot, clashed repeatedly behind closed doors recently with Gallant, accusing him of not taking decisive action against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. 'If Gallant tries to block a [major military] operation, he will be replaced,' Netanyahu's confidants were quoted as saying. Sa'ar is reportedly seeking the Defense Ministry portfolio, though Netanyahu is said to be trying to retain the Defense portfolio for the Likud, and offer instead the Foreign Ministry portfolio, currently held by Israel Katz (Likud). Talks between the Likud and the New Hope reportedly include proposals to also offer a ministerial position to former minister Ze'ev Elkin, another former member of the Likud.

Hamas’s methods for maintaining control over aid distribution are reported to include severe punitive measures against those who attempt to bypass their control. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Despite Gaza’s widespread devastation, Hamas continues paying salaries to its gunmen and civil servants partly through taxing and diverting humanitarian aid and distributing food vouchers — with the help of clans, criminal groups and so-called 'People’s Committees.' An Israeli security official told The Press Service of Israel, 'Hamas’ governance situation in the northern Gaza Strip is suffering from progressive necrosis,' adding that humanitarian aid appears to be 'intensive treatment' for the terror group. This perspective highlights the complexity of the situation in Gaza, where aid intended to alleviate the suffering of civilians is instead helping to sustain Hamas’s grip on power. Last week, Hamas managed to pay full salaries to its fighters and partial salaries to thousands of its 27,000 civil servants, TPS-IL has learned. This was done despite the heavy financial burden it places on the terror group, highlighting its determination to maintain its grip on Gaza. However, the continued financing of its war with Israel has raised concerns about the sources of this funding. Reports indicate that Hamas uses a variety of methods to gather revenue, including the imposition of 'transit taxes' on aid trucks carrying food, water, medicine, tents, blankets, and other goods into the Strip. According to testimonies, Hamas operatives in civilian clothes set up surprise checkpoints along key routes leading from the border crossings into Gaza. At these roadblocks, truck drivers are forced to pay hefty sums ranging from 50,000-100,000 shekels ($13,400-$27,000) or relinquish up to 50 percent of their cargo’s contents. In one reported instance, Hamas members seized 200 gas cylinders from a single truck, leaving only a small number behind — a profit of tens of thousands of dollars for the terror group. Charging $800 for ‘Donated’ Tents Beyond direct taxation, Hamas has been accused of confiscating humanitarian aid. Testimonies reveal that Hamas operates through a network of local clans and gangs that control main roads and intercept aid shipments. They then transfer this aid to Hamas warehouses, essentially creating a parallel economy. In return for their cooperation, these gangs receive monthly payments, reportedly around $10,000, ensuring a steady flow of goods to Hamas-controlled areas, including its tunnel network. This diversion extends to shelter and food aid as well. Tents sent from Arab countries intended to provide shelter for displaced Palestinians are reportedly being sold by Hamas at a cost of around 3,000 shekels ($800) per family. Food supplies, which include essentials delivered by trucks from various international donors, are looted and sold at inflated prices, sometimes 20 to 30 times their original cost. One report mentions that the price of a pack of cigarettes has soared to an astonishing $1,200. Hamas distributes food vouchers and coupons primarily through mosques under its supervision. According to several accounts, these distributions are carefully managed to benefit Hamas loyalists and their families. To enforce this system, Hamas deploys secret police units in shelters for displaced persons, ensuring that food and aid supplies are not accessed by unauthorized individuals. Hamas’s methods for maintaining control over aid distribution are reported to include severe punitive measures against those who attempt to bypass their control. Witnesses recount incidents in which residents caught with stolen goods were either killed or publicly humiliated. For incident, Hamas hung a resident of the Nuseirat refugee camp for allegedly stealing food. In another layer of control over humanitarian aid, Hamas receives support from organizations known as the 'People’s Committees' or the 'Emergency Committees.' These groups, comprising local clans, have agreements with Hamas allowing them to keep a portion of the aid arriving in Gaza while transferring the rest to Hamas. 'We didn’t know from the beginning to what extent the treatment of the humanitarian issue is a decisive element in the management of the war,' a senior Israeli political official told TPS-IL. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hamas, Houthis open offices in Baghdad	Thomas Juneau, a professor of international relations at the University of Ottawa, told the Times that Iran wants its proxies to coordinate more closely. By JNS Hamas and the Houthis have recently established offices in Iraq. The offices, which opened in June, testify to Iraq’s shift towards the Iranian camp in Tehran’s conflict with Israel and the United States. Since the U.S. military invasion to remove Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein 21 years ago, the country has maintained an 'uneasy balance' between its Iranian neighbor and America, The New York Times reported on Sunday. That balance has increasingly turned in Iran’s favor as Tehran has funded sympathetic forces inside Iraq as part of its effort to build an unbroken arc of Shi’ite power stretching west to Lebanon and south to Yemen. The Hamas representative in Baghdad is Mohammed al-Hafi, a member of the terrorist group’s bureau for Arab and Islamic Relations. The Houthi representative in Iraq is Abu Idris al-Sharafi. He has received an especially warm reception in Iraq, the Times said. The two offices are a concrete indication of the transformation of Iraqi politics since Hussein’s ouster. He suppressed Islamic movements, whether Sunni or Shi’ite, viewing them as a threat to his power. Shi’ites were exiled, imprisoned or executed. Today, Shi’ite parties dominate Iraqi politics, and Iran has pushed Iraq’s government to recognize Shi’ite militias. (The Hamas representative’s security detail is provided by one such militia, Kata’ib Hezbollah, the Times noted.) Shi’ite forces have formed political parties, gaining enough seats in the 2021 election to select the prime minister. Faced with the Shi’ite’s rise, Iraq’s leadership could do little but agree when Hamas and the Houthis requested to open offices. 'Some Iraqi government officials, according to two of the people who spoke to The New York Times, say privately they are not thrilled about their new guests but did not have the power to block them given the sway of the Iraqi political parties with ties to Iran,' the paper reported. Officially, Iraq has denied a move towards Iran. Thomas Juneau, a professor of international relations at the University of Ottawa, told the Times that Iran wants its proxies to coordinate more closely. There is 'a growing institutionalization of relations between Iran’s partners in the Axis of Resistance,' he said. Tehran has created a joint operation room and held regular meetings to bring proxy leaders together. 'Iran has appeared to encourage its proxies from different countries to share military skills and even coordinate on targets,' the Times reported. These efforts have 'intensified' since Oct. 7, Juneau said. Rashid al-Azzawi, chairman of the Iraqi Islamic Party, a Sunni Islamist party, said the war in Gaza has won sympathy for Hamas from Iraqis across all religions. Hamas is seen as fighting for 'a humanitarian cause,' he stated.

Israel ‘preparing for long war’ with Hezbollah – Report	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaling that Israel is ready for a large-scale confrontation with the Lebanon-based terror group. By World Israel News Staff As the chances of a ceasefire with the Hamas terror group in Gaza continue to fade, Israel is viewing an all-out war with Hezbollah as inevitable and is taking steps to prepare, according to Hebrew-language media reports. An anonymous security official told Channel 12 News on Friday that Israel 'should gear up for a long war' on the northern front. During a security cabinet meeting last Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly said Israel would soon need to engage in a 'large-scale confrontation' with Hezbollah. He expressed pessimism over the likelihood that Hezbollah's near-daily bombardments of communities and military assets in northern Israel could be stopped via a diplomatic agreement. Over the past 11 months, Hezbollah has caused at least 1 billion shekels in damages to homes in border areas, as well as forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of Israelis who lived near the Lebanese border. Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were said to have disagreed over the impact of a war with Hezbollah on Gaza. Gallant warned that a war in the north would necessitate the withdrawal of troops from the Gaza Strip in favor of placing them in Lebanon, which would reduce pressure on the Hamas terror group. The premier disagreed, saying he believed a simultaneous war in Lebanon would have little effect on Gaza, Channel 13 News reported. Netanyahu also pushed for the security cabinet to add the return of northern residents as an official goal of the ongoing war - a move that would signal Israel's intention to launch a decisive military campaign against Hezbollah, rather than continue the tit-for-tat attacks that have so far defined the conflict. Ynet reported that Netanyahu will travel to New York in late September in order to address the UN General Assembly, using the visit to drum up international support for an Israeli offensive against Hezbollah. Washington is reportedly pressuring Israel to delay attack plans until after the November 5th presidential election, but it's unclear if Israel will abide by that timeline.

Hamas chief Sinwar thanks Hezbollah leader for ‘your blessed acti...	Sinwar also thanked Nasrallah for expressing condolences for the death of Ismail Haniyeh. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar thanked the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah for his group’s support in the conflict with Israel, Hezbollah said on Friday, in the first reported message since Sinwar became Hamas’s overall leader in August. The Iran-backed Hezbollah has been waging attacks on Israel for nearly a year in a conflict across the Lebanese-Israeli border that has been taking place in parallel to the Gaza war. Hezbollah says its attacks aim to support the Palestinians. 'Your blessed actions have expressed your solidarity on the fronts of the Axis of Resistance, supporting and engaging in the battle,' Sinwar told Nasrallah, according to Hezbollah‘s al-Manar broadcaster. Sinwar has not appeared in public since the Oct. 7 attacks, and is widely thought to be running the war from tunnels beneath Gaza. It was the second time this week he is reported to have sent a letter. Hamas said on Tuesday he had sent one congratulating Algerian President Abdulmadjid Tebboune on his re-election. Hezbollah is the most powerful faction in an alliance of Iran-backed groups known as the Axis of Resistance, which have also entered the fray with attacks from Yemen and Iraq in support of Hamas during the Gaza war. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are internationally designated terrorist groups which receive funding, weapons, and training from Iran. Hezbollah has pummeled northern Israeli communities almost daily with barrages of drones, rockets, and missiles from southern Lebanon, where it wields significant political and military influence, since the start of the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas in October. About 80,000 Israelis have been forced to evacuate Israel’s north during that time due to the unrelenting attacks. Most of them have spent the past 11 months living displaced in hotels in other areas of he country. Nonetheless, in the early days of the Gaza conflict, former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal hinted at frustration over the scale of Hezbollah‘s intervention, thanking the group but saying 'the battle requires more.' Over the last year, Israel has killed around 500 Hezbollah fighters, including its top military commander Fuad Shukr. The toll is greater than Hezbollah‘s losses in its 2006 war with Israel. Hezbollah has said it had no advance knowledge of the Oct. 7 attack, which Sinwar masterminded. Sinwar also thanked Nasrallah for a letter he sent expressing condolences for the death of Ismail Haniyeh, the former Hamas leader killed in Tehran in July in an assassination widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. The hostilities across the Lebanese-Israeli border have forced tens of thousands of people to leave both sides of the frontier. The risk of escalation has loomed large. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Tuesday that Israeli forces are near to fulfilling their mission in Gaza and their focus will turn to the Lebanon border. Israeli leaders have said they would prefer to resolve the conflict through an agreement that would push Hezbollah away from the border. Hezbollah has said that it will continue fighting as long as the Gaza war continues.

Gal Gadot joins Israeli President Herzog’s ‘Voice of the People’ ...	The virtual event on Sunday will feature a live conversation between Herzog and Gadot, who will talk about Jewish pride and perseverance. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Israeli actress Gal Gadot will take part in a virtual event on Sunday that will mark the launch of Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s global initiative 'Voice of the People.' The initiative is a global Jewish council that aims to build 'a stronger, resilient Jewish community that will inspire and impact future generations.' It hopes to unite Jews from around the world and have them work together on addressing challenges affecting Jewish people worldwide. Herzog announced the initiative in August, and it is being lead by The President’s House as well as the World Zionist Organization, the Jewish Agency for Israel, and philanthropic supporters. The virtual event on Sunday will feature a live conversation between Herzog and Gadot, who will talk about Jewish pride and perseverance, according to Jewish News. The online event will also include a conversation between journalist Tamar Ish-Shalom and Daniel Lifshitz, who is the grandson of released Hamas hostage Yocheved Lifshitz, and Oded Lifshitz, who has remained in Hamas captivity since Oct. 7. There will also be a musical performance by Michal Greenglick, the sister of the late IDF soldier Shaul Greenglick. He was killed fighting Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip in December 2023 mere weeks after auditioning for the Israeli television singing competition 'The Next Star.' 'Our Jewish culture is one that celebrates the living vitality of discourse,' said Herzog. 'It is our responsibility to deepen the conversation between us — to come together and have honest discussions about vital issues facing the Jewish people. To develop the next generation of committed Jewish leaders, who will bring their gifts and their talents to preserving our precious peoplehood.' The 'Voice of the People' initiative has 150 members — 50 from Israel, 50 from the United States and Canada, and 50 from around the world. The members are selected for a two-year term. The initiative also has 10 fellows as well as appointed mentors.
