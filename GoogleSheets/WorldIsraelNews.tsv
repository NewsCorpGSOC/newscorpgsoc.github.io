Hostage-ceasefire deal officially signed by Israel and Hamas	Netanyahu's pre-dawn statement and the anticipated government approval appear to clear the path for implementing the deal. By World Israel News and AP A ceasefire and hostage exchange deal has officially been signed by Israel, Hamas, the United States, and Qatari officials, marking a significant development in the ongoing conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the agreement early Friday and stated that his political-security cabinet would convene to discuss and approve the terms, followed by a broader government meeting. Netanyahu's office released a statement, translated from Hebrew to English, outlining the next steps: 'The families of the hostages were informed a short while ago of the agreements by the Directorate for Hostages, Missing Persons, and Returnees in the Prime Minister’s Office. Additionally, the Prime Minister instructed the Coordinator for Prisoners and Missing Persons to coordinate preparations for the reception of the hostages upon their return to Israel.' The plan includes a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, the freeing of dozens of hostages held by Hamas, and the release of Palestinian terrorist prisoners held by Israel. It also paves the way for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to what remains of their homes in the war-torn Gaza Strip. The ceasefire is expected to halt over 15 months of conflict between the two sides. While the Israeli government is set to vote on the measure Saturday, logistical and last-minute issues with Hamas have delayed the planned release of the first three hostages until Monday. Netanyahu emphasized that resolving the hostage situation has been a top priority for his administration. Netanyahu's pre-dawn statement and the anticipated government approval appear to clear the path for implementing the deal, which was mediated with significant involvement from the U.S. and Qatar. If successful, this agreement could serve as a critical step toward de-escalating tensions in the region. Israel had delayed a Cabinet vote Thursday on the long-awaited ceasefire deal that would pause the fighting in the Gaza Strip and release dozens of hostages. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed a last-minute dispute with Hamas for holding up the approval as rising tensions in Netanyahu's government coalition raised concerns about the implementation of the deal just a day after U.S. President Joe Biden and key mediator Qatar announced it was complete. That created a dual reality: War-weary Palestinians in Gaza, the relatives of hostages held in the enclave and world leaders all welcomed the result of months of painstaking diplomacy, even as Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet vote on the agreement that had been scheduled for Thursday until Friday, at the earliest. Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of reneging on parts of the agreement in an attempt to gain further concessions. 'Hamas is backing out of the understandings and creating a last-minute crisis that prevents a settlement,' Netanyahu's office said. In a briefing Thursday, David Mencer, an Israeli government spokesman, said Hamas’ new demands dealt with the deployment of Israeli forces in the Philadelphi corridor, the narrow strip bordering Egypt that Israeli troops seized in May. Hamas denied the claims, with Izzat al-Rishq, a senior Hamas official, saying the militant group 'is committed to the ceasefire agreement, which was announced by the mediators.' It wasn't clear to what extent the holdup in the approval of the deal — originally scheduled to go into effect Sunday — also reflected jockeying to keep Netanyahu's wobbly government together. The ceasefire agreement has drawn fierce resistance from Netanyahu's coalition partners, on whose support the Israeli prime minister depends to remain in power. On Thursday, Israel's national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, threatened to quit the government if Israel approves the ceasefire. The deal announced Wednesday would see scores of hostages held in Gaza released and a pause in fighting with a view to eventually wind down a 15-month war that has destabilized the Middle East and sparked worldwide protests. Hamas terrorists triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack into Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Netanyahu faces great domestic pressure to bring home the hostages, whose families have pleaded with Netanyahu to prioritize the release of their loved ones over politics. But Israeli divisions over the deal were on stark display Thursday, as Ben-Gvir, a key government coalition partner and Cabinet member, threatened to resign, saying the ceasefire was 'reckless' and would 'destroy all of Israel’s achievements.' The departure of Ben-Gvir's Jewish Power party would reduce the number of the ruling coalition’s seats in the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, from 68 to 62 — leaving Netanyahu's government with just the slimmest of majorities. Ben-Gvir said his party would return to the coalition if Israel resumes its war. Ben-Gvir's resignation would not bring down the government or derail the ceasefire deal. But the move destabilizes the Israeli government at a delicate moment and could lead to the government's collapse if Ben-Gvir is joined by other key Netanyahu allies. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, for instance, is vehemently opposed to the agreement and has demanded that Netanyahu promise to resume the war against Hamas after the first phase of the ceasefire as a condition of his party staying in the coalition. Under the deal reached Wednesday, 33 of some 100 hostages who remain in Gaza are set to be released over the next six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israeli forces will pull back from many areas, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be able to return to what’s left of their homes, and there would be a surge of humanitarian assistance. The remainder of the hostages, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second — and much more difficult — phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal, while Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it dismantles the group and to maintain open-ended security control over the territory. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy joined the talks in the final weeks, and both the outgoing administration and Trump’s team are taking credit for the breakthrough. Longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction. Hamas has come under overwhelming pressure from Israel's invasion of Gaza’s largest cities and towns and seizure of the border between Gaza and Egypt. Its top leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was believed to have helped mastermind the 2023 attack, have been killed. But its fighters have regrouped in some of the hardest-hit areas after the withdrawal of Israeli forces, raising the prospect of a prolonged insurgency if the war continues.

Hostage mother may see one son return while the other remains in ...	She imagined the agonizing scenario of one of them being released and the other having to stay behind. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The announcement of the hostage release deal still waiting to be finalized was bittersweet for Ruth Strom, as one of her sons is slated for release during the first phase of the agreement while her other son remains a captive in Gaza. 'It is not easy for a mother to hear this,' Strom told Reuters. Her sons Iair (38) and Eitan (46) Horn were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th. Iair was on the list of 33 hostages who would be released in the first stage of the deal. The fact that the first hostages to be released are women, children, older men, and those who require medical attention implies that Iair is being released because he may be unwell. Although Ruth had not heard updates about her sons, she said she believed they are being held together. She imagined the agonizing scenario of one of them being released and the other having to stay behind. 'But what will happen at the moment when they are separated and told that one is coming out and the other is not?' she said. 'I know that their strength is to be together, to be there for each other,' she told Reuters. Ninety-eight hostages are being held in Gaza, and it is believed that a number of them are no longer alive. Following the release of the initial 33, other hostages will be released through subsequent negotiations, and the details are uncertain. The only information Ruth has received about Iair and Eitan was from hostages who were released during the pause in fighting last November. 'They said that they were not injured,' she recounted. 'At first, they were held in an apartment but were later moved to the tunnels.' Strom said that, for comfort, she speaks to her sons as if they are with her. 'I ask them to wait just a little longer, it will happen and you will be back with us. I ask for their forgiveness, for all the time that has passed in which they are not back here.' 'I have been optimistic from the first day, despite the ups and downs,' said Ruth.

10 soldiers injured during training exercise in the Negev	Three soldiers were moderately wounded, and seven sustained light injuries after a weapon exploded during an exercise at the Engineering Corps Training Base in the Negev. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Ten soldiers were injured during a training exercise in the Negev. Three soldiers were moderately wounded, and seven sustained light injuries after a weapon exploded during an exercise at the Engineering Corps Training Base in the Negev. The soldiers had previously participated in a classroom lesson that included a display of Hezbollah weapons. At 9 am, one of the weapons exploded during a classroom session. The IDF announced that the incident is being investigated. The base commander and other officers evacuated the wounded and conducted a preliminary investigation. There was a 24-hour suspension in training to allow for a thorough investigation of the incident. Three Israeli soldiers were injured, two of them critically, during a counterterrorism operation in Qabatiya, near Jenin in northern Samaria, on Tuesday night, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The soldiers' vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb planted by Palestinian terrorists, the IDF reported. All three soldiers were evacuated to the hospital for treatment, and their families have been informed. In a separate incident, Israel conducted an airstrike in Jenin as part of its ongoing counterterrorism efforts in Judea and Samaria, according to the IDF and the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet). The Palestinian Health Ministry reported that the strike left six people dead and several others injured. Israeli officials have not provided additional details about the target or the results of the operation.

Trump Security Advisor says US will support additional military o...	Waltz: 'If they (Israel) need to go back in, we’re with them.' oven By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Trump's National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said the US would support additional military operations in Gaza if necessary and declared that Hamas must be destroyed. Waltz told Fox News,'We’ve made it very clear to the Israelis, and I want the people of Israel to hear me on this: If they need to go back in, we’re with them,' he said. 'If Hamas doesn’t live up to the terms of this agreement, we are with them.' Waltz praised the hostage release deal currently being finalized and gave the credit for the agreement to Donald Trump. 'Hamas is not going to continue as a military entity and it’s certainly not going to govern Gaza,' Waltz declared. Waltz reported that he heard that about 25 of the initial 33 hostages slated for release in the first phase are alive. 'I’m convinced they all would have died if President Trump didn’t come in and say ‘get them out,'' Waltz said. Waltz discussed the 'Trump Effect' and the President-elect's threat that there would be 'Hell to pay' if the hostages were not released before his inauguration on January 20th. 'Hamas knew… they had no choice and they believed President Trump when he said there would be all hell to pay, and any deal that was on the table would just get worse once he was in office.' On a podcast, Waltz said that Hamas must no longer have a role in Gaza and must be destroyed. 'Hamas cannot have a role. ISIS doesn’t have a role. Al Qaeda doesn’t have a role,' he stated. 'It astounds me that people try to put them in some kind of special category. These are hostage-taking, murderous, rapist torturers that never should ever have any role in governing.' 'We shouldn’t subject the Palestinian people to that either,' he affirmed. 'We’ll never get to a better future; we’ll never get to a truly stable region if we don’t carve up this cancer.'

Defense Secretary hid hospitalization while on medication that ca...	While Austin transferred authority of some of his duties to deputy Kathleen Hicks on January 2, Hicks did not learn Austin was hospitalized until two days later. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s decision last year to keep his hospitalization secret and remain in command while on medication that could affect brain function 'unnecessarily' increased national security risks, according to a Pentagon watchdog report. 'The risks to our national defense, including the command and control of the Defense Department's critical national security operations, were increased unnecessarily,' Inspector General Robert Storch said, though his investigation 'found no adverse consequences to Defense Department operations.' Austin was hospitalized on January 1, 2024, due to complications from a prostate cancer surgery in December and was transferred to the intensive care unit the following day. The defense secretary waited several days before informing his deputy Kathleen Hicks and President Joe Biden, according to the Wednesday report. 'Secretary Austin received several different medications during the morning of January 2 that had the potential to affect cognitive functions,' the inspector general wrote. While Austin transferred authority of some of his duties to Hicks on January 2, Hicks did not learn Austin was hospitalized until two days later. Neither Austin nor Hicks notified the White House or Congress in a 'timely manner' as required by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, according to the inspector general. Austin also failed to transfer authorities on January 6 and 8 while undergoing medical procedures that required moderate sedation, the report noted. The defense secretary texted his chief of staff, Kelly Magsamen, that he did not want his medical condition to become 'a media circus.' 'I wish [Austin] were a normal person but he’s the [Secretary of Defense],' Magsamen wrote to another aide in a text message reviewed by the inspector general. 'We have a big institutional responsibility. He can't just go totally dark on his staff. … Please pass to him that we can’t keep his hospitalization a secret forever. It's kind of big deal for him to be in the [ICU]. And I'm worried sick.' Austin’s lack of transparency sparked a political uproar at the time, with President-elect Donald Trump calling for Austin to be 'fired immediately for improper professional conduct and dereliction of duty.' The general public was not notified of Austin's hospitalization until January 5.

Israeli Health Ministry publishes medical protocols for returning...	Each returned hostage will be cared for in specialized 'Returnee Wings' with private rooms for the hostages and their families. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s Health Ministry on Thursday released a detailed medical protocol for receiving hostages freed from Hamas captivity as the ceasefire agreement itself remained uncertain. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of backtracking on the ceasefire agreement and has refused to convene the Cabinet to discuss it. 'Israel will not set a date for a cabinet and government meeting until the mediators announce that Hamas has approved all the details of the agreement.' The ceasefire, if approved, would take effect on Sunday. Thirty-three hostages — women, children, the elderly and the sick — would be freed in exchange for Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The ministry’s plan outlines the stages of care, treatment, and long-term support to address the needs of the returnees. The Ichilov, Beilinson, Sheba, Assaf Harofeh hospitals in central Israel and the Barzilai and Soroka hospitals in the south were selected for their proximity to Gaza and in the south. While the ministry recommends a minimum hospitalization period of four days, the final decision will rest with the returnees and their families. Each returned hostage will be cared for in specialized 'Returnee Wings' with private rooms for the hostages and their families. Military representatives will have designated spaces within these wings. Separate general areas for larger gatherings will be established to avoid overcrowding in the main corridors. The ministry’s plan includes a long-term support framework for each returnee, led by a team of primary care physicians, nurses, specialists, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, dietitians, and forensic physicians. Together, they will devise personalized treatment plans. Social workers and mental health professionals will assess psychological needs with an eye toward reintegrating the returnees into normal life. Forensic physicians will collect and document medical-legal evidence related to the captivity. Outpatient clinics will be established to provide continuous medical and emotional support after the returnees are discharged. In December, a Health Ministry report detailed severe physical and psychological abuse suffered by hostages freed during a November 2023 temporary ceasefire. The report — the first comprehensive account of hostages’ experiences — found that the captives, including children, were subjected to extreme conditions, including sexual assaults, prolonged periods in darkness, physical beatings, and starvation. Many were bound hand and foot and deprived of adequate food and water. Several were burned or branded with heated metal. Medical care was either withheld or administered without pain relief, resulting in excruciating suffering during procedures, including surgeries, the report found. Hostages were also denied basic hygiene and often forced to soil themselves due to prolonged waits for toilet access. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 95 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

NVIDIA to launch $500 million AI data center in Israel	Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden has included Israel in a restrictive category of countries for the export of advanced graphics processors, in a blow to the industry. By JNS American technology giant NVIDIA announced on Wednesday that it is establishing a new artificial intelligence research and engineering data center in Israel. The Santa Clara, California-based corporation said that the $500 million, 10,000 square meter facility will be one of the largest and most advanced data-center labs in Israel. The data center, which is currently under construction near the northern Israeli city of Yokneam, focuses on advancing next generation data technologies, including networking hardware, software, CUP design and AI applications. It is set to begin operations in the first half of the year. The company has a large R&D presence in Israel, where thousands of employees run seven labs. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden has included Israel in a restrictive category of countries for the export of advanced graphics processors, in a blow for the industry. The move, which was taken during the last week of his administration and is due to take effect in 120 days, seeks to balance U.S. national security concerns with economic interests, and could hamper 120 countries, including Israel, from competing in AI. NVIDIA on Monday condemned the move as 'sweeping overreach' by the administration.

Major European carriers to resume Israel flights in February	Hungary-based Wizzair has already resumed flights, while Ireland’s Ryanair is due to renew service this spring, returning to a full schedule in the summer. By JNS The Lufthansa Group of airlines announced Thursday that it will resume service to Israel next month. The move by the global aviation group, which includes Lufthansa, Swiss International Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, ITA Airways, and Eurowings, comes as an increasing number of foreign airlines are renewing flights to Ben-Gurion International Airport as regional tensions de-escalate. British Airways and Air France are expected to follow suit. The three major U.S. legacy carriers are still not flying to Israel. United and American Airlines suspended flights to Israel indefinitely, while Delta is scheduled to resume flights to Tel Aviv in April. United and Delta sought to restart flights to Israel periodically over the last year, only to extend the suspension of service following flareups in the war, while American Airlines has stayed away entirely. A United spokesperson told JNS on Wednesday that the company had no news to offer yet on the renewal of flights. Lufthansa will operate daily flights between Frankfurt and Munich, and Israel, starting on Feb. 1, Swiss will offer daily flights to Zurich, Austrian Airlines will run daily service to Vienna, Brussels Airlines will have three weekly flights, and Eurowings will fly twice weekly to Düsseldorf. The gradual resumption of flights is expected to accelerate in the spring. Renewed service by major European airlines follows the resumption of service by popular low-cost carriers. Hungary-based Wizzair has already resumed flights, while Ireland’s Ryanair is due to renew service this spring, returning to a full schedule in the summer. January and February are typically the slowest months for travel to Israel. Some 48,000 passengers passed through Ben-Gurion International Airport on Thursday on more than 300 international flights, including 25,600 departing Israel and 22,400 arriving, according to the Israel Airports Authority.

Deri: Israel-Hamas deal back on track	The agreement is still expected to go into effect at 12:15 p.m. on Sunday, the official said. By JNS The hostage deal with Hamas is on, Aryeh Deri, the chairman of Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Shas Party who previously served as an observer on the War Cabinet, announced on Thursday night. 'A few minutes ago, I received the final word that all obstacles have been overcome and that the agreement is underway,' the Sephardic haredi politician declared in a speech at his party’s annual conference in Jerusalem. 'Now they are working on the final technical wording. 'I want to congratulate Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu; he is responsible for the agreement,' Deri told attendees. Minutes after Deri’s announcement, the Axios news outlet cited a U.S. government source as confirming that the final disputes holding up the ceasefire-for-hostages-and-terrorists-release deal were resolved, 'and the agreement is now done.' The Israeli Security Cabinet is now scheduled to meet on Friday morning to green-light the deal with Hamas, followed by a vote in the full Cabinet, an Israeli official told the Kan News public broadcaster. The agreement is still expected to go into effect at 12:15 p.m. on Sunday, the official said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters during a press conference in Washington that the Biden administration likewise remains 'confident' that the deal will be implemented on Sunday. 'I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday. Look, it’s not exactly surprising that in a process, in a negotiation, that has been this challenging, this fraught, you may get a loose end,' he said. 'We’re tying up that loose end as we speak; I’ve been on the phone, in one way or another, all morning with [U.S. National Security Council Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa] Brett McGurk, with our Qatari friends, and I am very confident this is moving forward,' Blinken said. Earlier on Thursday, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that the White House was aware of eleventh-hour issues with the Hamas-Israel hostage agreement but remained confident that the ceasefire could still be implemented. The Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem had accused the Palestinian terrorist organization of backtracking on parts of the deal signed on Wednesday, 'in an effort to extort last-minute concessions.' 'We’re aware of these issues that the prime minister has raised today, this afternoon, their time, and we’re working through that,' the Biden administration official said of Netanyahu’s earlier announcement that Hamas reneged on parts of the agreement that was reached in Doha. Thirty-three hostages, living and dead, out of the 98 held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 468 days are set to be freed during the first phase of the deal, in exchange for 1,000 Palestinian terrorists jailed by Israel. (The 33 freed captives are to include nine ill and wounded hostages who will be released in exchange for the release of 110 Palestinian terrorists serving life sentences.) The Israel Defense Forces is to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt. The withdrawal is to begin on the 42nd day of the first phase, after the release of the final (33rd) hostage for the phase, and is to be completed by the 50th day. Israeli Minister for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud Party, announced on Thursday night that he will resign from his position 'if there is a withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor (before the war goals are achieved), or if we do not return to fighting to achieve the war goals.' 'This deal is difficult to digest and involves heavy prices. Therefore, as was the case with the previous vote, I will make my final decision only after the full details of the deal are presented,' Chikli wrote on X. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s Religious Zionism Party previously signaled its seven Knesset members would consider exiting the coalition over the ceasefire deal. Smotrich has demanded that Netanyahu commit to resuming the war to dismantle Hamas and secure the release of all hostages following the deal’s first phase. This commitment is a condition for the party’s continued presence in the government and coalition.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has indicated that he may remain in the government and back the first phase of the hostage deal if Israel resumes the war against Hamas immediately after that. Smotrich, who leads the Religious Zionist party, threatened earlier to leave the government over his opposition to the hostage release deal. On Thursday, Smotrich said he would potentially support the first phase if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu provides written assurances that the war will continue until Hamas is eliminated as a prerequisite for his party remaining in the coalition. Although the Prime Minister's Office indicated the guarantees could be provided, Smotrich said key issues have not yet been resolved. In a statement, the Religious Zionist Party said, 'The faction supports the demands of party chairman, Minister Bezalel Smotrich, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure Israel resumes its fight against Hamas and secures the release of all hostages.' It continued, 'They call for a revised strategy aimed at achieving a decisive victory, to be implemented immediately after the first phase of the agreement. This is a key condition for the party's continued participation in the government and coalition.' Religious Zionist Party MK Tzvi Succot told public broadcaster Kan Radio on Thursday morning, 'I think the chances are high that we will leave the government.' Last month, Smotrich expressed strong opposition to the potential hostage-for-prisoner deal. Smotrich told Kol Barama radio, 'Hamas is at its weakest point since the war began.' 'This is not the moment to offer it any reprieve. We must continue to apply pressure and defeat it, ensuring that the hostages are returned under terms that demonstrate its surrender, not ours,' he added. Smotrich continued, 'Deals that involve releasing hundreds of terrorist murderers, who will return to killing Jews, or agreements that see us withdrawing from northern Gaza and allowing a million Gazans to come back and undo the hard-earned progress we’ve made with so much bloodshed—those are grave mistakes. 'If we weren’t negotiating with Hamas and instead focused solely on targeting them with our sights, tank fire, airstrikes, and the efforts of our heroic fighters, the hostages would have been freed long ago.'

‘We’re back to October 6’ – IDF is building wall around Sderot	The protective barrier near the Gaza border shows that the old security perception hasn’t changed, angry residents said. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Residents of Gaza envelope communities are enraged over the IDF beginning to build a high stone wall near Sderot, saying that this proves that the army has not changed its old and failed security perceptions, Channel 12 reported Thursday. 'As soon as I saw the wall,’ said a resident of the city whose son was murdered along with 1,200 others during the Hamas invasion last October 7, 'I realized that nothing has changed nor will change here. We’re back to October 6.' Yarin Sultan, a member of the Israel Envelope Forum, also sharply criticized the move to the Hebrew-language media outlet. It is, she said, 'another link in a chain of conceptual failures. The state continues to cling to outdated approaches that are satisfied with cosmetic treatment [of the problem] and do not provide real security to the residents of the south.' 'Walls did not stop the Nukhba terrorists from penetrating through them and slaughtering children, the elderly, and raping women, so why should they succeed this time?' she added. The government must 'act differently and commit to real security,' Sultan said. 'We demand a fundamental solution that will convey strength and determination, not walls that hide the problem and don’t solve it once and for all.' The army said in response that the wall was being built so that train service can recommence to the town. 'The IDF is working on a variety of efforts to enable the return of the train, including tailored military operations and an ongoing situation assessment,' its spokesperson told Channel 12 in a statement. 'This is with the understanding that this is an important strategic national infrastructure and a central factor in the process of restoring the western Negev.' 'Protective work is currently being carried out to strengthen the defense layer in a way that will allow safe travel by train. The IDF is working and will continue to work to return the residents to their homes safely.' All the residents of the Gazan envelope who survived the Hamas onslaught were immediately evacuated as Israel declared war on the terrorist rulers of the Gaza Strip. Many lived for about a year in hotels and other accommodations paid for by the government. Most returned gradually to the area when it was declared safe by the IDF, attempting to rebuild their former lives. These included most of the residents of Sderot, a city of 33,000 that suffered the loss of some three dozen people, 20 of them police officers, on the day of the invasion.

Palestinian Authority: Israel ‘whines about 100 hostages’	Palestinian terrorists held in Israel have excellent prison conditions and regular visits from the International Red Cross. By Palestinian Media Watch The hundreds of families being emotionally tortured by Hamas as they wait the return of their loved ones who were kidnapped over 15 months ago are 'whining,' according to the official Palestinian Authority daily. The PA has defended, glorified, and celebrated the October 7 atrocities. It has now added an additional component to its terror support by disparaging Israel's criticism of Hamas' holding the hostages. And to 'prove' its point, the PA says the ones who are truly suffering are Palestinian prisoners detained under due process for acts of terrorism because they are held in 'camps of barbarous Israel, which are worse than Hitler's fascist Holocaust furnaces.' 'The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has turned the facts upside down&#8230; It whines about 100 hostages and ignores thousands of Palestinian detainees who have had the most despicable sadistic methods implemented against them in the fortresses and detention camps of barbarous Israel, which are worse than Hitler's fascist Holocaust furnaces in World War II.' [Regular columnist Omar Hilmi Al-Ghoul, Official PA daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, Dec. 25, 2024] This hate-speech, which is a staple of PA propaganda, both completely scoffs at the suffering of the Israeli hostages in Gaza and odiously abuses the Holocaust's memory. There is no equivalence between the horrific conditions of Israeli hostages held in dungeon-like underground tunnels with no light and scarce food who face fear of torture, rape, and even murder on a daily basis. Palestinian terrorists held in Israel have excellent prison conditions and regular visits from the International Red Cross. The suggestion that those Palestinian prisoners endure conditions worse than in Nazi death camps is not only absurd and insulting to the Jewish people, but these dangerous PA libels are now echoed internationally, fueling antisemitism and attacks on Jews worldwide.

Jewish Voice for Peace committed fraud to obtain six-figure COVID...	JVP, according to federal prosecutors, applied for and received a second-draw loan and loan forgiveness under the Paycheck Protection Program, which was not open to groups primarily engaged in political advocacy. By Alana Goodman, The Washington Free Beacon Jewish Voice for Peace, the prominent anti-Israel group that's organized illegal protests attacking the Jewish state, committed federal loan fraud to obtain a six-figure COVID relief check, the Department of Justice announced. JVP falsely portrayed itself as a non-political group to obtain over $300,000 in federal paycheck protection funding, federal prosecutors said in a press release. It was forced to pay $677,634 to the federal government to settle the allegations under the False Claims Act. The news comes as JVP faces suspensions on college campuses for organizing pro-Hamas rallies. Lawmakers have also called on the IRS to revoke JVP’s tax-exempt status, arguing that the group has supported illegal encampments at universities and 'has a history of sharing antisemitic tropes, expressing support for violence and terrorism, and vilifying Zionism and Zionists.' Just days after Hamas's Oct. 7 terror attack, meanwhile, JVP organized an illegal protest in which activists infiltrated the Capitol and accused Israel of 'genocide.' JVP, according to federal prosecutors, applied for and received a second-draw loan and loan forgiveness under the Paycheck Protection Program, which was not open to groups primarily engaged in political advocacy. As part of the application process, JVP claimed it was 'not a business concern or entity primarily engaged in political or lobbying activities.' However, an 'investigation revealed that [JVP] was primarily engaged in political activities,' according to the DOJ. In response to the allegations, the group told authorities its false claims were 'inadvertent' and agreed to repay double the loan amount to avoid civil charges and additional financial penalties. George Soros's Open Society Foundations has given JVP at least $650,000 since 2017 to fund 'human rights' work in the Middle East. JVP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'The Paycheck Protection Act Program existed to help businesses survive a devastating global pandemic,' said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves. 'When business owners unfairly drain those funds—either by not reading the eligibility requirements or disregarding them—they put the entire program at risk.'

Anti-deal protestors block entrance to Jerusalem	Demonstrations are planned for Thursday night at intersections throughout the country as Cabinet vote on deal is delayed. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israelis who feel that the announced hostage deal with Hamas endangers the country and is a death sentence for those not released in the first phase demonstrated Thursday morning at the main entrance to Jerusalem, causing massive traffic jams. The protestors marched on the street to the Bridge of Strings carrying fake coffins draped in Israeli flags and chanting, 'We don’t leave hostages behind.' Hundreds blocked the Bridge of Strings intersection Wednesday night as well, chanting, 'We will not make a deal with the devil.' In the evening protest, clashes broke out with police officers who were trying to clear the road, with protestors shouting at them in anger over being treated differently than those blocking roads in support of hostage deals, whom the police have largely left alone. Both crowds were led by the Heroes Forum and Tikva (Hope) Forum, whose members are families of soldiers who have fallen in the 15-month-long war and families of Hamas hostages, respectively, who have been demanding for months that the government stick to its stated war goal of destroying Hamas as the only way to bring all the hostages home. Bereaved families and their supporters even slept overnight on the street in front of the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem after the hostage deal was announced, to begin the protest against the agreement. In asking in the morning for others to join them, Heroes Forum chairman Yehoshua Shani said, 'We call from here on the Prime Minister, on the entire Cabinet, to stop at the last moment. Don’t sign a deal that means surrender, abandoning the remaining hostages and undermining Israel's security.' Referring to several rows of fake, flag-covered coffins that had been set up on a nearby sidewalk, he said that the result of this deal will mean 'more and more soldiers will be in such coffins.' 'Members of the government,' he added, 'it is up to you to stop the catastrophe.' The Cabinet was supposed to meet at 11AM to vote on the deal, which led to the morning demonstration, but due to last-minute concessions demanded by Hamas, it has been postponed to Thursday evening. The Forums are calling on the public to come in their masses to demonstrations at intersections throughout the country at 7:30 pm to express their opposition to the deal.

Joy, relief, and division: Israel reacts to hostage deal	The Cabinet is due to meet on Thursday morning to approve the agreement. Qatari leaders said the ceasefire would take force on Sunday. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Israel was gripped by a whirlwind of emotions on Wednesday night following the announcement of a deal to release Israeli hostages held by Hamas Political leaders and families of the captives reacted with joy, relief, and some apprehension. Haredi party leader and Minister of Housing and Construction Rabbi Yitzchak Goldknopf of Agudat Israel expressed support for the deal in a tweet framing the issue as a moral imperative. 'With God’s help, I will once again fulfill the mitzvah [religious commandment] of redeeming captives, supporting the Prime Minister’s responsibly led deal while safeguarding Israel’s security interests. We are waiting for you!' MK Benny Gantz, head of the opposition’s Unity Party echoed the sentiment. 'It is simply the only way forward,' Gantz tweeted. Gantz also extended appreciation to outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, crediting the latter with a 'critical role' in finalizing the agreement. 'We must now ensure Gaza never again rebuilds as a terrorist haven,' Gantz added. Another opposition member, Yesh Atid party MK Debbi Biton shared her gratitude, retweeting Trump’s announcement of the deal and adding, 'Thank you, Donald, the son of Fred!' But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, the leader of the Religious Zionism party called the agreement 'bad and dangerous for Israel’s national security.' While acknowledging the joy bringing captives home, Smotrich warned that the agreement could undo the war’s gains and the sacrifices of soldiers. 'We oppose it with full force,' Smotrich said. He emphasized that resuming the war to destroy Hamas and return the rest of the hostages was a condition for his party’s continued participation in the government. Hope, Anxiety and Protests The Hostages and Missing Families Forum greeted the deal with 'overwhelming joy and relief.' A statement issued by the Forum thanked international mediators and U.S. leaders for their efforts. But the Forum stressed, 'We urgently call for swift arrangements to ensure all phases of the deal are carried out. We will not rest until we see the last hostage back home.' In contrast, the Hope Forum, also representing hostage families, voiced sharp criticism. Labeling the deal as dangerous, it warned agreement would 'abandon dozens of hostages' and pave the way for future attacks. 'This agreement risks those left behind in captivity and threatens the entire nation of Israel,' the Forum said. It called for an alternative agreement to free all the hostages at once. Anger and opposition was most palpable among bereaved families, who staged protests outside the Prime Minister’s Office. Under the leadership of Yehoshua Shani, the Valor Forum set up tents and declared a 'national emergency.' Shani described the deal as 'a disaster in the making' that endangers Israel’s security by leaving 70 hostages behind. 'We demand the government halt this agreement and ensure the safety of the nation,' he stated in a video appeal. The Cabinet is due to meet on Thursday morning to approve the agreement. Qatari leaders said the ceasefire would take force on Sunday. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 95 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Netanyahu faces political crisis as Smotrich weighs coalition exi...	National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir is also threatening to pull his Otzma Yehudit Party from Netanyahu’s coalition over the deal and has called for Smotrich to join him. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s Religious Zionism Party signaled on Thursday it would likely exit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition over the ceasefire agreement with Hamas. The party convened Thursday morning to deliberate on its role in the governing coalition ahead of a likely cabinet vote on the agreement, according to Hebrew media reports, although the Prime Minister’s Office announced in the morning that the vote had been postponed due to Hamas reneging on parts of the deal. 'The Israeli Cabinet will not convene until the mediators notify Israel that Hamas has accepted all elements of the agreement,' according to the PMO. A party official called the crisis 'serious and real,' according to Channel 12 News. Knesset member Zvi Sukkot earlier told Israel’s Reshet Bet radio that Religious Zionism was likely to leave the government. He emphasized that the party aims to 'transform the DNA of the State of Israel' rather than simply hold positions in the coalition. Smotrich has openly opposed the agreement, which was announced on Wednesday, as a 'surrender deal' and a 'catastrophe' for the Jewish state. He has reportedly set conditions to stay in the government should the agreement be approved, including a government commitment to the dismantling of Hamas and renewing the fighting in Gaza following the ceasefire. He participated in closed-door meetings with Netanyahu on Tuesday and Wednesday. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir is also threatening to pull his Otzma Yehudit Party from Netanyahu’s coalition over the deal and has called for Smotrich to join him. Meanwhile, Israeli leaders from both sides of the political aisle came out in favor of the hostage deal announced on Wednesday. Yair Lapid, leader of the opposition and chairman of the Yesh Atid Party, said: 'An entire country isn’t breathing tonight. We are all waiting, and we are all praying. But we cannot stop now, and the deal cannot end in its first part. I promise as I promised in the past a [political] safety net [for Netanyahu] until the last moment, until the last hostage. Everyone must return home.' Benny Gantz, chairman of the National Unity Party, stated that 'securing the release of the hostages from the arms of the murderous terror organization Hamas is a top moral and strategic imperative. It is simply the only way forward.' He extended thanks to the negotiators in Israel, Egypt and Qatar; to outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden; and to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. 'As President Trump said, we must now ensure Gaza never again rebuilds as a terrorist haven and continues to threaten the State of Israel,' said Gantz.

Simcha and Leah Goldin – Netanyahu has abandoned our son	Soldiers Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul, whose bodies were abducted in 2014’s Operation Protective Edge, are reportedly not included in the hostage deal. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The parents of Lieut. Hadar Goldin have charged the prime minister with abandoning their son 'for good' after reports emerged that his body was not included in the hostage deal with Hamas that was announced Wednesday. 'For ten years, it was made clear to us that the [Palestinian] prisoners released in the Gilad Shalit deal who were returned to prison during Operation Protective Edge would not be released except in exchange for Hadar and Oron,' Simcha and Leah Goldin said. In 2011, Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been grabbed five years earlier by Hamas terrorists who attacked his tank near the Gazan border, was released in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including the future leader of Hamas and mastermind of last October 7’s terrorist invasion in which 1,200 people were massacred and the current hostages were abducted. Several dozen of the released Palestinians were caught in subsequent years after returning to their terrorist activity. 'Now Netanyahu is releasing the terrorists who were returned to prison and not returning Hadar and Oron. For us, Hadar and Oron have been abandoned for good,' the bereaved parents continued. Sgt. Oron Shaul’s body was abducted on July 20, 2014, shortly after the Operation against Hamas began, when in fighting in Shejaya in northern Gaza, terrorists fired an anti-tank missile at his armored personnel carrier, killing all those inside. Less than two weeks later, Lieut. Goldin was killed while on patrol in the southern Gaza town of Rafah. Hamas terrorists grabbed his body and disappeared into a tunnel with it. The Goldins’ conclusion was stark: 'Hamas cares for its terrorists more than Netanyahu cares for his soldiers. Benjamin, not Yoni.' Yonatan (Yoni) Netanyahu led the famed IDF raid on the Entebbe airport in 1976 to rescue 94 Jewish passengers who were being held hostage by terrorists of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), who had hijacked their Air France plane and diverted it to Uganda. He was the only soldier to die in the operation, which was posthumously named for him. One elderly hostage, who had been taken to the hospital, was murdered in revenge afterward. Two other Israelis, both psychologically impaired, who have been held alive in Gaza for years, are included in the current deal. Avera Mengistu, who is Ethiopian, and Hisham al-Sayed, a Bedouin, were seized by Hamas in 2014 and 2015 respectively after wandering into the coastal enclave on their own. In June 2022 Hamas released a video showing Al-Sayed in a hospital bed with an oxygen mask and an IV drip in his arm. In January 2023, the terrorists released an undated video message that included Mengistu briefly asking how long he would remain a prisoner 'after so many years of pain and suffering.' Likud MK Tsega Melaku told Israel National News Thursday that she had received an excited and emotional phone call from Mengistu’s mother saying that 'official sources' had informed her that her son was to be released along with the other Hamas hostages. The Goldins, who have tirelessly campaigned throughout the years of operations against Hamas that no ceasefire deal should be signed unless the terrorists return their son and Shaul’s bodies, have largely kept out of the media during the current war.

Hamas demanding last-minute changes, deal not yet final	Prime Minister's office says Israeli negotiators told to 'stand firm' in the face of 'last-minute extortion attempts' by Hamas. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror group is demanding last-minute concessions be added to the ceasefire and hostage deal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a media statement. Despite announcements from U.S. officials and the Qatari government that a deal had been reached, Netanyahu stressed that an agreement has not yet been finalized. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu held a conference call a short while ago with the negotiation team in Doha, who reported to him on last-minute attempts by Hamas to backtrack from the understandings of May 27,' read a statement from his office released in the early hours of Thursday morning. 'Among other things – contrary to a specific clause that grants Israel the veto power over the release of mass murderers who are symbols of terrorism - Hamas is demanding to dictate the identities of these terrorists. The Prime Minister instructed the negotiation team to stand firm on the agreed-upon understandings and to reject outright Hamas's last-minute attempts at extortion,' the statement added. Notably, Netanyahu has not yet invited the war cabinet to a meeting to vote on the deal. That meeting, which was expected to take place on Wednesday morning, appears to have been delayed as negotiators in Qatar continue discussions. Political considerations for the survival of the existing coalition may also be a reason behind the delayed vote. The Religious Zionism party, led by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has expressed vehement opposition to the deal in its current form. Zvi Sukkot, a Religious Zionism MK, said that the party would likely withdraw from the government if the deal is approved, which would trigger a new round of elections. Opposition parties, including the Islamist Ra'am party, have pledged to vote in favor of the deal, all but guaranteeing it will be passed by the Knesset - even without the Religious Zionism party's votes.

‘End of Gaza genocide’ welcomed by the Squad	Squad members Ilhan Omar and Ayana Pressley welcome ceasefire, blame Israel for humanitarian crisis in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Far-left, progressive lawmakers welcomed the news of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, while slamming Israel for its prosecution of the war. Anti-Israel lawmaker Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) drew a moral equivalency between the plight of Israelis kidnapped from their homes and Palestinian prisoners convicted of serious terror offenses, including murderer. 'I’m relieved to see hostages and Palestinian detainees being released as part of the deal, bringing much-needed comfort to their families who have endured so much,' Omar wrote on X. 'We must permanently end the genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza, humanitarian aid needs to increase exponentially to avoid continued suffering,' she added. 'And work toward a just and lasting peace and self-determination for the Palestinian people.' Notably, Omar ignored the fact that Hamas stole and stockpiled the vast majority of humanitarian aid entering the Strip, then sold the goods to hungry Gazans at exorbitant prices. Rep. Ayana Pressley (D-MA), another member of the Squad, said the ceasefire was the first step to healing for members of her district who had been impacted by the conflict. In a media statement, Pressley expressed sympathy with the families who have been 'grieving for the 1,200 Israelis murdered by Hamas, for the tens of thousands of civilians killed in the genocide in Gaza unleashed by the Israeli military and aided by U.S. dollars, for the hostages yet to be reunited with their loved ones and those who have died in captivity, and for the death and destruction Palestinians have been subjected to for over a year.' Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a Jewish progressive lawmaker who has long been critical of the Israeli government, released a media statement 'welcoming' the 'long overdue' ceasefire. Sanders added 'there must be accountability for the many war crimes committed by both sides in this terrible conflict.'

Israel expects ‘dozens of corpses’ among first freed hostages	Some of the families of the hostages will be 'surprised' to discover that their loved ones were murdered. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli authorities are expecting 'dozens' of dead bodies to be returned to Israel, during the first phase of a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas that appears to be imminent. On Wednesday, president-elect Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas had okayed an agreement, which would see a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of some of the Israeli hostages held by the terror group for more than 15 months. Notably, the first stage of the deal will see Hamas return 33 hostages to Israel - but it's unclear how many of those captives are still alive. A report from Hebrew-language outlet Walla noted that some of the families of the hostages will be 'surprised' to discover that their loved ones were murdered. 'According to what we understand, dozens of abductees will return as corpses. Alongside the great joy of families who will celebrate with their loved ones after returning from captivity alive, there will be families shattered by this, and we will provide them with the necessary help,' officials told Walla. The officials stressed that being able to give their loved ones a proper burial in Israel would provide much-needed closure to the families of slain hostages. The State of Israel will provide logistical and psychological support to families during the process of finally laying their loved ones to rest, officials said. 'This is our mission, and we will do our duty to the families. We should expect to see difficult scenes with coffins [returned to Israel],' they said. 'It is going to be difficult, but just as we managed on October 7, we will do everything in the most sensitive way and give each kidnapped person the respect they deserve with a dignified burial,' they added. Although the deal has been widely touted by American and Qatari officials, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still has not officially announced that the deal has been finalized.

‘Gaza is victorious, Israel lost’ – Iran celebrates ceasefire	Gaza ceasefire is a 'defeat for the monstrous Zionist regime,' says IRGC in a media statement. By World Israel News Staff Iran's leadership and military forces celebrated the Gaza ceasefire on Thursday, releasing jubilant messages that describe the end of the fighting as a major blow to Israel. 'It will be written in books that there was a mob who once killed thousands of children &#038; women in Gaza! Everyone will realize it was the patience of the people &#038; steadfastness of Palestinian Resistance &#038; Resistance Front that forced Zionist regime to retreat,' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote in English and Hebrew posts on his official X account, alongside the hashtag #GazaIsVictorious.' The IRGC welcomed the ceasefire in a statement published by the state-controlled Tasnim news agency, characterizing the deal as a 'defeat' for Israel. 'The end of the war [marks] a great victory for Palestine, and an even greater defeat for the monstrous Zionist regime,' the statement read. 'It brings joy, vitality, and resilience to the people of Gaza as they return to their homes.' Mohammed Abdusalam, a spokesperson for the Iranian-backed Houthi terror group, congratulated Hamas on the ceasefire. 'We salute Gaza's legendary and historic resilience in the face of Israel's fiercest aggression against the oppressed Palestinian people,' Abdusalam said in a media statement. 'With its continued occupation of Palestine, [Israel] represents a threat to the security and stability of the region.' The Houthis have repeatedly attacked Israel in recent months, claiming that its explosive drone and ballistic missile launches were in solidarity with Gaza. It's unclear if the ceasefire will mean an end to the Houthi aggression against the Jewish State. While world leaders have hailed the ceasefire deal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stressed that the agreement is not yet final. In a statement, Netanyahu's office said Hamas is attempting 'last-minute' changes to the deal. The Israeli government will not sign off on the agreement until all details are finalized, his office said.

Who are the American hostages kidnapped by Hamas?	Sagui Dekel-Chen and Keith Siegel expected to be released in first round of hostage release and ceasefire agreement. By World Israel News Staff Two Americans are among the first 33 hostages expected to be freed from Hamas captivity after a ceasefire deal comes into effect. There are seven Americans still held by the terror group, with only three of them believed to be alive. Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, and Keith Siegel, 65, are on the list of the hostages Hamas will release as part of the first phase of the agreement. Dekel-Chen was last heard from around 9:30 a.m. on October 7th, after he joined his kibbutz's emergency response team to fight off invading Hamas terrorists. Little is known about Dekel-Chen's physical condition. Notably, as a man under the age of 50, his release in the first phase of the deal indicates that he is sick or wounded. Siegel, who appeared in a recent Hamas propaganda video, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza alongside his wife, Aviva. She was released in a hostage deal in December 2023. 'I just don’t know what kind of Keith that we’re going to get back,' Aviva Siegel told Fox News in December. 'I’m worried about all the hostages, because the conditions that they are in are the worst conditions that any human being could go through,' she said. 'I was there. I touched death. I know what it feels being underneath the ground with no oxygen.' Edan Alexander, 20, a U.S.-born IDF soldier, will not be released until the second phase of the deal. Negotiations over that stage of the agreement are slated to begin two weeks after the ceasefire is implemented. Itay Chen, Omer Neutra, and married couple Gadi and Judi Haggai are all confirmed to have been murdered on October 7th. Chen and Netura were IDF soldiers killed while attempting to stave off the terror onslaught. The Haggais were murdered in their kibbutz by terrorists while out for a Saturday morning walk. All four of their bodies were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip.

Trump’s National Security Advisor: ‘Hamas is a cancer that must b...	Waltz on Hamas: 'We'll never get to a truly stable region if we don't carve up this cancer.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump's National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, said that Hamas has no role to play in post-war Gaza and that the terror group must be destroyed to the extent that it can never rebuild. Speaking on the Call Me Back podcast with Dan Senor on Wednesday, Waltz said, 'We've been clear that Gaza has to be fully demilitarized, Hamas has to be destroyed to the point that it cannot reconstitute, and that Israel has every right to fully protect itself.' 'Hamas cannot have a role. ISIS doesn't have a role. Al Qaeda doesn't have a role,' he stated, adding, 'It astounds me that people try to put them in some kind of special category. These are hostage-taking, murderous, rapist, torturers that never should ever have any role in governing,' he added. 'We shouldn't subject the Palestinian people to that either,' he affirmed, further saying, 'We'll never get to a better future; we'll never get to a truly stable region if we don't carve up this cancer.' Waltz emphasized that Hamas shouldn't be 'rewarded' for kidnapping American citizens. 'There are terrorist groups and rogue states that have been taking Americans hostages, and they have only seen upsides,' Waltz said. However, Waltz said that in Trump's case, 'he made it very clear there would only be downsides.' He added that the terror group may find that things will get worse for them with Trump in office. 'After January 20, any deal that they thought was on the table is only going to get worse.' 'This is about imposing consequences for those who would do this type of horrendous act like we saw on October 7 who would take Americans or allies hostages.' 'I don't like any deal with these sick evil sons of whatever, and we should never ever reward the horrendous acts of October 7.' Trump repeatedly warned that there would be 'hell to pay' if Hamas didn't release the hostages by January 20, his inauguration day. As of Wednesday night, a hostage release deal was announced. The first phase will involve the release of 33 hostages.

UN secretary-general calls antisemitic UN official Francesca Alba...	Albanese has blamed the Jewish state for Hamas's Oct. 7 attack and comparedNetanyahu to Hitler. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese was a terrible human being, according to outgoing Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism Deborah Lipstadt, the Jewish Insider reports. Guterres made the remarks to Lipstadt during a Munich Security Conference, saying twice that Albanese was a 'horrible person.' A spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General neither confirmed nor denied that he made the comment, and the Forward emphasized that the UN chief has no authority over special rapporteurs. Albanese has frequently made remarks that were heavily critical of Israel and antisemitic. Even before Hamas's massacre on Oct. 7, Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) President Morton A. Klein and ZOA Director of Research and Special Projects Liz Berney, Esq. wrote letters calling on the UN to remove Albanese from her position due to her vicious anti-Israel bias and refusals to condemn deadly Palestinian Arab terror attacks against innocent Israelis. She has compared Israelis to Nazis and claimed that the US was 'subjugated to the Jewish Lobby.' Albanese has blamed the Jewish state for Hamas's Oct. 7 attack and compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler. Albanese, the UN special rapporteur for Judea, Samaria, and Gaza, has argued that the Jewish state does not have a right to defend itself against Hamas, and she 'liked' posts on X endorsing the antisemitic trope of the 'Jewish billionaire class.' She likened Netanyahu to Hitler in a July X post, and hours after the Oct. 7 attack, she said the 'violence must be put into context.' Albanese also said that the victims of Oct. 7 'were not killed because of their Judaism but in response to Israel's oppression.' She also accused Israel of committing genocide and advancing a 'settler-colonial project in Palestine.'

Israel and Hamas agree to ceasefire deal to pause Gaza war and re...	Over six weeks, 33 of the nearly 100 hostages are to be reunited with their loved ones after months in captivity with no contact with the outside world, though it’s unclear if all are alive. By The Associated Press Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal, mediators announced Wednesday, pausing a devastating 15-month war in the Gaza Strip and raising the possibility of winding down the deadliest and most destructive fighting between the bitter enemies. The deal, coming after weeks of painstaking negotiations in the Qatari capital, promises the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas in phases, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and would allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes. It also would flood humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. Three officials from the U.S. and one from Hamas confirmed that a deal had been reached, while a senior Israeli official said details are still being ironed out. All three U.S. officials requested anonymity to discuss the contours of the deal before the official announcement by mediators in Doha. U.S. President Joe Biden was preparing to address the breakthrough agreement later Thursday, officials said. Any agreement still needs to be approved by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet, but is expected to go into effect in the coming days. The deal is expected to deliver an initial six-week halt to fighting that is to be accompanied by the opening of negotiations on ending the war altogether. Over six weeks, 33 of the nearly 100 hostages are to be reunited with their loved ones after months in captivity with no contact with the outside world, though it’s unclear if all are alive. It remained unclear exactly when and how many displaced Palestinians would be able to return to their homes and whether the agreement would lead to a complete end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza — key Hamas demands for releasing the remaining captives. Many longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the task of reconstruction. Still, the announcement offered the first sign of hope in months that Israel and Hamas may be winding down the most deadly and destructive war they’ve ever fought, a conflict that has destabilized the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.

Fighting fire: Lessons from Israel as Los Angeles battles catastr...	Prevention and community involvement are the cornerstones of Israel’s fire management approach and this multipronged strategy includes strategic tree pruning, firebreaks, and high-tech solutions. By Sveta Listratov, TPS As Los Angeles battles devastating wildfires, Israeli emergency experts shared their insights after tackling hundreds of fires sparked by Hezbollah rocket barrages in the past year. Fires in the Los Angeles area have killed 25 people and destroyed at least 12,000 buildings. Thousands of residents were ordered to evacuate and around 770,000 homes were without electricity as utility companies shut down power in certain areas as a precaution. The fires spread quickly because of high winds and drought conditions. Winds are forecast to increase on Wednesday with gusts reaching as high as 102 km/h. Israel’s Fire and Rescue Authority said on Wednesday it would dispatch a team of five fire protection experts to the U.S. to provide assistance. 'Firefighting methods are largely universal—creating firebreaks and concentrating manpower. But the game-changer is the weather. In California, low humidity and strong winds make firefighting exponentially harder,' Itzik Oz, Southern District Commander of Israel’s Fire and Rescue Services told The Press Service of Israel. The district oversees 67% of Israel’s territory. 'In Israel, we conduct patrols during extreme weather conditions to identify risks and act quickly. The saying is true: if you respond to a fire early, you can handle it with a bucket of water. If you’re late, even a truck won’t suffice,' he explained. Oz led a firefighting delegation to California three years ago. 'We were there to both learn and assist. We participated in the firefighting efforts, so I understand the challenges the U.S. faces,' Oz told TPS-IL. He explained that winds up to 160 km/h spread embers far, creating new fires, a phenomenon known as 'spotting' which he called a 'major challenge.' California’s hot, dry summers that make conditions ripe for wildfires reminded him of massive fires in the Jerusalem forest and in and around Haifa in recent years. Prevention and Community Involvement Prevention and community involvement are the cornerstones of Israel’s fire management approach. Many of the initiatives are done in collaboration with Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael – Jewish National Fund, an Israeli non-profit that focuses on environmental conservation, land reclamation, forestry, and development. This multi-pronged strategy includes strategic tree pruning, firebreaks, and high-tech solutions. Asaf Karavani, Director of Climate Change and Sustainability Division in KKL-JNF emphasizes the importance of 'buffer zones,' areas around communities where vegetation is managed to reduce fire intensity. 'Following the Carmel fire in 2010, Israel made it a priority to establish these zones, and today, 97% of them are complete,' Karavani noted to TPS-IL. The Carmel forest fire of 2010 killed 44 people and forced the evacuation of 17,000 people. The fire was inadvertently started by a teenager with a nargila coal and was followed by a wave of arson. But communities also play a role. Col. Shiran Hashai-Levi, a senior officer in Israel’s Homefront Command and director of the Israel National Resilience Institute, stressed the importance of empowering civilians. 'We are a training center where emergency scenarios are studied with the goal of advancing preparedness on the home front, improving readiness in both civilian and military spaces,' Hashai-Levi explained to TPS-IL. 'We train citizens in local authorities as part of a ‘self-rescue’ framework—providing basic skills in fire suppression, rescue, and first aid until professional forces arrive.' Karavani explained to TPS-IL, 'The people who live closest to forests are the first to notice and respond to unusual activity. Their proximity makes them critical in the early detection of wildfires.' During fire emergencies, community members assist firefighters by clearing pathways, guiding first responders, and evacuating vulnerable populations. Said Hashai-Levi, 'Part of community resilience is also returning to normalcy, reopening the economy, and maintaining functional continuity. This allows parents to send their children to school and society to regain its footing after the emergency is over.' She added, 'It’s easier to go from normalcy to emergency than to return from emergency to normalcy. This is a challenging task, but resilience is a virtuous cycle. The quicker the return to functionality, the greater the sense of resilience.' Hezbollah barrages in 2024 sparked fires that burnt 2,000 acres of protected lands and 42,000 acres of grazing areas. In June, a spokesperson for the Fire Brigade told TPS-IL that firefighters battling blazes near the Lebanese and Gaza borders were forced to take the unusual step of carrying rifles and pistols, along with protection equipment provided by the army and police. Said Karavani, 'Wildfires are a global issue, but sharing knowledge and management techniques can make a difference.'

IDF use of air power increasing in Judea and Samaria amid rising ...	Iran, which has lost most of its strategic assets in the Middle East, is focused on setting Judea and Samaria ablaze with terror financing, know-how and weapons, he cautioned, while smuggling arms into the sector from Jordan. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS The Israel Defense Forces has conducted 110 airstrikes in Judea and Samaria since the beginning of the current conflict in October 2023, according to a statement by the IDF Spokesperson Unit on Jan. 11. These strikes, carried out in cooperation with the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet), have resulted in the elimination of at least 165 armed terrorists who posed an immediate threat to Israeli forces. Lt. Col. (res.) Amit Yagur, former deputy head of the Palestinian arena at the IDF Planning Branch and a former naval intelligence officer, told JNS that air power is just one of multiple tools used by the IDF to boost security operations in Judea and Samaria. Air strikes focus a 'relatively large' amount of firepower in a short period, 'without risking the lives of our forces on the ground,' Yagur stated. This approach is particularly effective due to its speed and precision, he said. 'We have improved greatly over the years, and the Air Force has an incredible ability to carry out pinpoint strikes in combination with intelligence. This allows us to achieve accuracy, inflict significant damage, avoid harm to uninvolved civilians, and, most importantly, avoid danger to our forces,' he said. The use of air power also conveys a broader strategic message, he argued. 'Just as we deal with our enemies outside, where our air force is decisive and prominent, here too [in Judea and Samaria] we gradually begin to do this.' Decision makers had initially been hesitant to employ air power in Judea and Samaria, he said. This was partially motivated by a desire to keep a lower profile in the region, as well as past pressures from Washington, he explained. However, another driver is the changing nature of terrorism in Judea and Samaria, he said, highlighting the development of terror groups into more organized and systematic entities. Iran, which has lost most of its strategic assets in the Middle East, is focused on setting Judea and Samaria ablaze with terror financing, know-how and weapons, he cautioned, while smuggling arms into the sector from Jordan. Yagur referred to this phenomenon as 'the Gaza-ization of Judea and Samaria,' noting that areas like Jenin and Tulkarm have become breeding grounds for larger-scale terror groups, even as so-called lone-wolf attacks remain a challenge. 'What used to be small terror cells or nests of terror has become groups of terror and even battalions of terror in several places,' he told JNS. In response, Yagur said Israel needed to weigh a combination of broader, more aggressive military operations and other civilian-political measures that extend beyond the IDF’s remit. 'Aggressive deterrent actions are essential,' he said, stressing the importance of restricting the movement of terror groups and reintroducing checkpoints in certain areas. 'I do not rule out, in extreme cases, the possibility of temporarily evacuating civilians during military operations to distinguish between the terrorists and the civilian population,' he added. 'Ultimately, terror organizations depend on civilian legitimacy. When they have civilian legitimacy, they thrive.' The Palestinian Authority, he said, must undergo an urgent reform, including a change to its education system that indoctrinates Palestinian children into viewing Israel as their enemy, thereby ensuring a new generation committed to hate and conflict. Such a reality could easily produce a new Oct. 7-style mass murder attack from or in Judea and Samaria, he warned, adding that the military cannot solve all of these problems on its own. Efforts to reform the P.A.’s governance and educational systems are critical to preventing terrorism, he concluded. Col. (ret.) Moshe Elad, one of the founders of security coordination between the IDF and the Palestinian Authority and a lecturer at Western Galilee College in Acre, addressed the P.A.’s involvement in recent counter-terrorism efforts in Jenin. 'The advance of [P.A. General Intelligence Service head Majed] Faraj’s forces is not significant and appears to be more for public relations purposes,' said Eilad. He emphasized that 'the main burden of counter-terrorism remains on Israel.' 'I do not recommend being impressed by the words of praise and flattery that Hamas and Fatah lavish on each other. Beneath the surface, there is deep hostility between them, which has persisted since 2007 [when Hamas carried out a coup in Gaza],' he explained. Despite numerous reconciliation attempts—'over 30, in fact'—Elad noted that none have succeeded, underscoring the deep divisions between the two factions. According to Elad, the P.A.’s security operations are partly motivated by a desire to signal competence to the Trump administration, with the aim of convincing it to grant the P.A. a role in post-war Gaza. 'Abu Mazen [P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas] wants to present an image of a Palestinian Authority that is capable of overcoming terrorism, including a hint regarding the day after Gaza, as if to say, ‘We are ready to take control of the Gaza Strip.’' However, without Israeli security measures, the P.A. would struggle to maintain any stability in Judea and Samaria, he added. 'It’s absurd: While the P.A. officially criticizes Israel and calls for its withdrawal, it depends on the IDF’s presence in Judea and Samaria, which actually saves it,' said Elad. Ultimately, Elad said, the IDF is utilizing a range of tools to tackle terrorism, ranging from ambushes to airstrikes. 'It is not possible to plan for something that will suit all types of terrorist activities. One must apply a suite to eradicate terror for all scenarios, or series of incidents, individually. Hence, the use of air power, whether it is quadcopters, drones, a helicopter, or plane, is a function of the decision that follows a situation analysis,' he added.

The cameras offer 360-degree and thermal imaging capabilities, and most of the recent IDF casualties were caused by explosive devices triggered by such cameras. By JNS Hamas has been using advanced cameras smuggled into Gaza on board humanitarian aid trucks to target Israeli forces in the Strip, Hebrew media reported on Wednesday. These cameras allow remote detonation of explosives, contributing to high casualties among Israeli soldiers, particularly in northern Gaza, according to Channel 12 News. Since Sunday, nine soldiers have been killed and 14 wounded by explosives in Beit Hanoun. The cameras offer 360-degree and thermal imaging capabilities, and most of the recent IDF casualties were caused by explosive devices triggered by such cameras, according to the report. A senior IDF officer stated that the military should have approached operations in Beit Hanoun differently, suggesting a more cautious and systematic strategy instead of storming the area, as Hamas had prepared with explosives and cameras in strategic locations. 'We left Beit Hanoun in January 2024, and Hamas had a year to prepare for our return. Every alley here is booby-trapped with explosives and rigged with cameras. We had to approach it differently—strike and clear the area from the air or use heavy engineering tools before any further ground entry. We shouldn’t have stormed in—we needed to proceed slowly and systematically. We need to rethink our strategy,' the officer said, according to Channel 12.

Netanyahu denies Hamas accepted deal amid reports of imminent agr...	Israeli officials claim deal will be signed by Thursday, despite Prime Minister denying reports Hamas has approved proposal, and with lingering questions regarding support for deal within Israeli government. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli officials said Wednesday afternoon that a hostage deal and ceasefire agreement will be finalized with Hamas either Wednesday night or on Thursday, according to reports by multiple media outlets. One unnamed Israeli official told the Israeli news site Walla Wednesday that Hamas' Gaza chief Mohammed Sinwar had okayed the current proposal on the table in Doha, Qatar. 'There is a breakthrough in the hostage deal negotiations in Doha. Hamas military leader in Gaza Mohammed Sinwar gave his OK,' the official was quoted as saying. Israel's national broadcaster Kan cited Palestinian sources who also claimed a breakthrough has been reached in the negotiations and that a deal is likely to be presented by Thursday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, downplayed the reports of an impending deal, and rejected claims that Sinwar, brother of the slain former leader of Hamas, had accepted the latest hostage deal proposal. 'Contrary to reports, the Hamas terrorist organization has yet to provide an answer regarding the deal,' the prime minister's office said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. If negotiators in Doha are able to reach an agreement, Netanyahu will face opposition from within his own government in ratifying the deal. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) has hinted his party will bolt the coalition should the current proposal be accepted, and boasted Tuesday that he had torpedoed previous bids to reach a hostage deal that would end the war in Gaza. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, chairman of the Religious Zionist Party and an erstwhile ally of Ben-Gvir, hinted earlier this week that he would opposed the deal in its current form, but on Wednesday took a more nuanced position. In a video statement released Wednesday morning, Smotrich said that he would insist the war in Gaza not be ended prematurely, but refrained from ruling out support for the hostage deal, which would include a three-stage ceasefire. Israeli media outlets have reported that Netanyahu is pressuring Smotrich to remain in the government, even if it ratifies the current ceasefire plan. The ultra-Orthodox Shas and United Torah Judaism parties have already vowed their support for the deal, while Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar's New Hope party is also expected to vote in favor of the ceasefire agreement. However, seven Likud lawmakers signed onto a letter earlier this week expressing opposition to the deal. Opposition lawmakers, including Opposition Leader and former Prime Minister Yair Lapid, have offered to provide Netanyahu a parliamentary safety net should the deal come up for ratification in the Knesset.

Iran accuses Israel of planting bombs in nuclear equipment	Iranian vice president and former FM claims Israel attempted to sabotage Iran's nuclear program by planting bombs in centrifuges, but adds attempt was foiled. By World Israel News Staff Israel attempted to sabotage Iran's nuclear program recently by planting explosives inside centrifuges ordered by Tehran from abroad, a senior Iranian official claimed Tuesday. A preview of a soon-to-be-released interview given by Iranian Vice President and former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was released by the anti-regime outlet Iran International, including excerpts regarding the alleged Israeli sabotage plot. Speaking with Iran's Hozour program, Zarif said that Iranian nuclear officials had ordered centrifuges, which were later found to have been embedded with explosive devices apparently planted by Israel. Zarif did not disclose when the alleged incident occurred, nor did he share details on how the explosive devices were detected or how Iran ascertained Israel was behind the attempted sabotage. 'Our colleagues had purchased a centrifuge platform for the Atomic Energy Organization, and it was discovered that explosives had been embedded inside it, which they managed to detect,' Zarif said. Zarif ripped international sanctions imposed on Iran, saying the use of intermediaries for such purchases provided more opportunities for sabotage by hostile powers. 'Instead of being able to order equipment directly from the manufacturer, sanctions force you to rely on multiple intermediaries for such purchases,' Zarif said. 'If the Zionist regime infiltrates even one of the intermediaries, they can do anything and embed anything they want, which is exactly what happened.' Zarif compared the attempted sabotage of Iran's nuclear program with the September, 2024 bombing attacks conducted by Israel's Mossad on Hezbollah terrorists using compact explosive devices planted in pagers and handheld radios. 'The issue with the pagers in Lebanon turned out to be a multi-year process, meticulously orchestrated by the Zionists.'

Over a million Gazans to return to northern Gaza Strip in phase 1...	Limiting almost two million noncombatants to humanitarian zones is what permitted the IDF to fight Hamas effectively. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Allowing the Gazan civilian population to return to their homes is allegedly included in the first stage of the hostage deal whose final details are currently being worked out in Doha, Ma'ariv reported Tuesday. The paper noted that this clause has been 'hidden' from the public, as what has been reported in the media is that in this six-week phase of the ceasefire, some 1,000 Palestinian security prisoners will be released from Israeli jails, the IDF will withdraw from population centers in the coastal enclave, and a massive amount of humanitarian aid will be permitted entry, in exchange for the release of 34 hostages. 'A million men, women and children will move north along the coastal route to Gaza City [and points north] without any restrictions,' the report said, and an additional 300,000 will return to the southern city of Rafah. 'The only Israeli demand is that the returning cars be inspected. There is no restriction on the movement of those returning on foot,' the report added. 'If true,' the paper noted, Hamas will 'receive the big prize' in the beginning of the deal instead of at its end, after all the rest of the hostages are freed, including the more than a third who are dead. This is because the residents’ return effectively means the end of the war, since limiting almost two million noncombatants to humanitarian zones is what permitted the IDF to fight Hamas successfully everywhere else. It also reduced political pressure on Jerusalem to stop, although the international community still pressed Israel unremittingly about the number of civilian casualties being reported, despite the low 2-1 noncombatant-to-combatant ratio being unheard-of in war. Hamas would still hold more than 50 hostages, which would allow it to demand further concessions from Israel, the report noted, such as the release of even more prisoners and more aid, allowing the terrorists to boast that they had achieved a victory over Israel that no other Palestinian or Arab entity had attained. Without mentioning at which stages this would occur, Channel 14 meanwhile reported Tuesday that 'in the deal,' the IDF will maintain a presence along the entire border area that will extend 800 meters into the Strip. This will include a good part of the Philadelphi Corridor that runs along the Gazan border with Egypt and Jerusalem calls Hamas’ 'oxygen pipeline,' as weapons and supplies were smuggled through and under this border area for nearly two decades. The report added that the Netzarim Corridor that cuts Gaza roughly in half, which has become a wide highway dotted with small military bases and watchtowers along its length and occupies 56 square kilometers, will be taken over by an international force that will supervise the return of some one million northern Gaza residents to their homes. Whether they can ensure that no terrorists will be among them is the question, the report concluded.

IDF eliminates 50 terror targets in Gaza, killing Hamas commander	In parallel, there are reports in Arab media of the IDF starting to dismantle its military infrastructure in the Strip. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF eliminated fifty terror targets throughout Gaza overnight Tuesday, including a senior Hamas commander who operated out of an ostensible school building. Guided by precise military and Shin Bet (internal security agency) intelligence, the high-ranking terrorist was hit in an airstrike on the former educational institution, which Hamas had turned into a command-and-control complex. The compound was located in Duraj Tuffah, between Jabalya and Shejaia in the northern part of the Strip that has been the focus of significant IDF ground forces’ operations for weeks to destroy newly-re-formed terror brigades. Other airstrikes took place in Khan Yunis in the south and Deir al-Balah in the center, destroying terrorist cells, weapons depots, underground infrastructure, and Hamas anti-tank positions, the army said. These bombings join the more than 1,400 other airstrikes the IAF conducted in December alone against such targets, either as independent actions or in close support of ground troops, who call in air support as needed. But while the army is continuing to convey a 'business as usual' attitude in conducting its anti-Hamas operations, there are reports that it is preparing for the consequences of the hostage deal whose negotiations are reportedly near the finish line in Doha. Citing Palestinian sources, Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed has reported that the IDF had begun dismantling infrastructure it had built along the Netzarim Corridor that cuts the Gaza Strip roughly in half. According to the report, 'Local eyewitnesses in Gaza said that military transport vehicles entered the Netzarim axis, one of the important strategic points in the Strip, and began the process of dismantling military towers on its western side.' While the IDF will reportedly leave populated areas of the Strip while remaining in its various buffer zones in the first stage of a deal, which is to last six weeks, Hamas has made clear that in order to get the rest of the hostages back, both living and dead, in future stages, Israel will have to completely withdraw from the Gazan enclave and end the war. Many in the Israeli public, including right-wing politicians, military experts and some hostages’ families, believe that Israel cannot afford to leave the most sensitive areas in the Strip, especially the borders, both between Israel and Gaza and Egypt and Gaza, in order to prevent Hamas from regrouping, rearming, and again posing a serious security threat to the country.

Argentina’s president wins ‘Jewish Nobel Prize’	President Javier Milei, known for his staunch support of Israel, becomes the first head of state ever to win the Genesis Prize. By World Israel News Staff On Tuesday, The Genesis Prize announced President of Argentina Javier Milei as the 2025 Genesis Prize Laureate, the first time the award, known as 'The Jewish Nobel Prize,' has been bestowed upon a head of state. Milei was the unanimous choice of the nine judges on the committee, which commended him for his unequivocal support of Israel during one of the most difficult times since the founding of the Jewish State. President Milei recently announced his decision to move the Argentinian embassy to Jerusalem, has reversed years of anti-Israel votes by Argentina in the United Nations, and has pledged to bring culprits responsible for the AMIA and Israeli Embassy bombings in Argentina in 1992 and 1994, respectively, to justice. Just last week, Milei ordered declassification of intelligence regarding the unexplained death of Alberto Nisman, the special prosecutor responsible for the AMIA bombing investigation. Former Argentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner is presently being tried for obstructing that investigation and for her government’s controversial 2013 Memorandum with Iran, which shielded the accused terrorists and lifted Interpol alerts intended to arrest them. The planned relocation of Argentina’s embassy to Jerusalem is in sharp contrast to the actions of several other South American countries, which cut diplomatic relations with Israel and recalled their ambassadors over the war in Gaza. Shortly after the start of hostilities initiated by Hamas on October 7, 2023, Bolivia severed diplomatic ties with Israel, accusing it of carrying out 'crimes against humanity,' while Chile and Colombia recalled their ambassadors as they criticized the Israeli military offensive against Hamas militants. In May 2024, Brazil withdrew its ambassador to Israel after months of tensions between the two countries. 'President Milei is a true hero of the Jewish people,' said Co-Founder and Chairman of The Genesis Prize Foundation Stan Polovets. 'Unlike leaders of many other countries around the world who either remained quiet, pressured and – in some cases – sanctioned Israel, President Milei has unequivocally supported the Jewish people and their state. This award reflects Israel’s heartfelt appreciation for the President and the people of Argentina. A friend in need is a friend indeed.' In addition to Milei’s strong pro-Israel stance, the Genesis Prize Selection Committee praised his achievements in reforming Argentina’s economy, including bringing inflation down from 25% per month to 2.4%, reversing the freefall of the country’s currency, and posting a fiscal surplus for the first time in 15 years. Notably, the 'S&P Merval Index,' which tracks the performance of the largest publicly traded companies listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, has generated a return of 173% in 2024, by far outperforming all other global markets. During the same period, Brazil’s stock market fell 7% and Mexico’s 11%, while S&P 500 rose 'only' 27%. Previous Genesis Prize honorees include Michael Bloomberg, Michael Douglas, Itzhak Perlman, Anish Kapoor, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Natalie Portman, Robert Kraft, Natan Sharansky, Steven Spielberg, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, Albert Bourla, and Barbra Streisand. In addition to honoring individual laureates, in 2024 The Genesis Prize Foundation bestowed its prize on Israeli NGOs supporting the released and rescued hostages and their families and helped fund lawsuits against the leadership of Hamas in international jurisdictions. This followed a $1 million award to Jewish activists working to uphold Ukraine’s independence and alleviate the suffering of the people of Ukraine in 2023. Milei has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine’s fight for freedom and independence, and in June 2024 was awarded the Order of Freedom by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And during the Hanukkah celebrations last month, Zelenskyy used a menorah gifted to him by Milei during the inauguration of Argentina’s president in December 2023. 'I am deeply honored to receive the Genesis Prize,' stated President Javier Milei. 'Of course, I will not keep the monetary prize; I will donate it to causes that support freedom and the fight against antisemitism, both in Argentina and around the world.' 'I have deep admiration for Israel, its history, and its people. The Jewish people have shown throughout their history that resilience and the defense of freedom are essential to overcoming any challenge. This spirit is a cornerstone of the relationship between Argentina and Israel, and I will work to further strengthen our ties.' Although raised Catholic, Milei has increasingly embraced Judaism since taking a sincere interest in 2021, studies Torah regularly, attends prayer services, placed a mezuzah on his office door, and stated his intention to convert to Judaism upon leaving office. His cabinet meetings often start with a discussion of the week’s Torah portion, while one of the most influential government officials, Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein, took the oath of office on a Chumash, a copy of the Pentateuch or the five books of Moses. Shortly after being inaugurated, President Milei appointed his rabbi and spiritual guide, Axel Wahnish, as Argentina’s Ambassador to Israel. Last year, Milei revealed that his grandfather, a great influence on his life, discovered shortly before he passed away that his mother was Jewish. Milei also has shared that his great-great-grandfather was a rabbi who instilled Jewish education and values in his children and grandchildren.

‘If we go back to fighting, the costs will be heavy,’ security ex...	He also stressed the high operational costs of regaining control over critical areas of Gaza, such as the Netzarim Corridor and the Philadelphi Corridor. By Sveta Listratov, TPS As Israel weighs the merits of an emerging hostage and ceasefire deal, one security expert warned that the agreement has too many parallels with another hostage deal that led to the October 7 attacks. 'Ultimately, the deal is about security. No matter how you spin it, the effects are inherently tied to Israel’s security,' Col. (Res.) Hezi Nechama told The Press Service of Israel. Nechama, a former brigade commander, is one of the founders of the Forum of Reservist Commanders and Fighters. 'By the next morning after the deal, Hamas will begin to recover and rearm faster than we might think. We’ll soon return to a scenario where Hamas operates as a powerful, armed organization,' he told TPS-IL. Nechama drew parallels to the Gilad Shalit deal of 2011, when Israel freed 1,027 security prisoners for Shalit. Many of the terrorists involved in planning Hamas’s October 7 attack, including its mastermind, Yahya Sinwar were among those released in that swap. He also stressed the high operational costs of regaining control over critical areas of Gaza, such as the Netzarim Corridor and the Philadelphi Corridor. The Netzarim Corridor is a roughly eight km road that cuts off northern and southern Gaza. The Philadelphia Corridor is a buffer zone that runs the length of the 14-km Gaza-Egypt border. It was created in 2006 to prevent weapons smuggling after Israel disengaged from the Strip but Hamas violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority the following year. 'Re-conquering these areas will come at the price of many soldiers’ lives and injuries,' Nechama said, adding that abandoning these positions before all the hostages are released could lead to captives being transferred abroad via the Sinai to Yemen, Iran, or Turkey. Another point of the deal, releasing convicted terrorists to Judea, Samaria, and Gaza, poses a direct threat to Israeli citizens, Nechama warned. 'These individuals have blood on their hands, and their motivation to carry out further attacks is often heightened after their release,' he said. Moreover, allowing Gaza’s reconstruction without stringent oversight would lead to massive financial aid flowing into the hands of Hamas. 'Anyone who thinks they can control how these funds are used is turning a blind eye. The money will inevitably strengthen Hamas’s rule and bring in new weaponry that we’ll have to face in the future,' Nechama told TPS-IL. While saving the lives of captives may justify these risks, Nechama stresses that such decisions should be made with full awareness of the price. 'If we go back to fighting, the costs will be heavy, unless we abandon the idea of fighting Hamas altogether, which means conceding our objectives,' he explained. Under the terms of the emerging ceasefire, it is expected that the first 33 hostages to be released will be humanitarian cases — women, children, the elderly, and the sick. Palestinians from northern Gaza who fled to southern areas of the Strip will be allowed to return to their homes. Israeli forces will not withdraw from the Strip until all the hostages are freed. Opponents of the agreement are against any deal that does not bring home all the hostages at once. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 95 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Three IDF soldiers wounded by roadside bomb near Jenin	The IDF also struck a terror cell in Jenin killing six terrorists and causing multiple injuries. By Joshua Marks, JNS Three Israeli soldiers were wounded, two of them seriously, during a counterterrorism operation in Qabatiya near Jenin in northern Samaria overnight Tuesday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Their vehicle was hit by a roadside explosive device planted by Palestinian terrorists, the IDF said. All three were evacuated to hospital for treatment, and their families were notified. Airstrike in Jenin In a separate development, Israel carried out an airstrike in Jenin as part of ongoing counterterrorism operations in Judea and Samaria, according to the IDF and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet). According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, the strike resulted in six fatalities and multiple injuries. Israeli authorities have not disclosed further details about the target or the operation’s outcome. The strike follows an unprecedented counter-terror operation by the Palestinian Authority’s security forces in Jenin in recent weeks. These incidents reflect heightened tensions in Judea and Samaria as the IDF has intensified operations in the region, targeting terror hubs in Palestinian camps. Since the start of the war, around 800 terrorists have been killed, and over 6,000 arrested. On Saturday evening, Israeli security forces arrested two Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists who were on their way to carry out a shooting attack in the 'immediate future.' PIJ operatives Ahmad Zaqarna, 21, and Tariq Abu Zayd, 25, from Qabatiya, were arrested in Nablus (Shechem) with two loaded M-16 rifles, ammunition and military gear in their possession. In the wake of the Jan. 6 terrorist shooting that killed three Israelis in the Arab village of Al-Funduq, just west of Nablus, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced that he had approved 'a series of additional offensive and defensive actions in Judea and Samaria.' The terrorists who carried out that attack, killing Rachel Cohen, 73, Aliza Rice, 70, and Israel Police Master Sgt. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein, 35, remain at large. Seven more people were wounded in the attack. On Sunday, an Israeli woman was lightly injured by Palestinian rock-throwers near the village of Hares, located close to Ariel in Samaria. The victim was evacuated to the hospital with minor facial injuries caused by flying shards of glass. Several additional vehicles were damaged in the attack, according to the Israel Defense Forces, which launched a search for the assailants.

Jewish groups condemn ’60 Minutes’ segment criticizing US support...	AJC CEO Ted Deutch said in a statement on X that the '60 Minutes' segment on Sunday night 'relies on the same biased accusations and information that attempt to demonize and delegitimize Israel.' By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The investigative news television program '60 Minutes' has been widely criticized for airing a 'one-sided' and 'biased' segment on Sunday night that featured former US State Department officials who condemned American support for Israel’s defensive war against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip. The CBS News show aired a segment titled 'Dissent Within the State Department Over US Role in Israel-Hamas War.' It highlighted interviews with three former US State Department officials who resigned from their positions in protest of US support for Israel’s ongoing military actions in Gaza, which target Hamas terrorists who orchestrated the deadly terrorist attack in southern Israel that took place on Oct. 7, 2023. One of the former State Department officials told '60 Minutes': 'There is a linkage between every single bomb that is dropped in Gaza and the US because every single bomb is dropped from an American-made plane.' The American Jewish Committee (AJC) called the '60 Minutes' segment 'biased and misguided' in a statement released on Monday. The organization detailed a slew of issues with the segment, including its mention of unverified civilian casualty figures and the fact that it barely mentioned the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7 that started the ongoing war in Gaza. The segment even described Hamas fighters as 'militants' rather than terrorists. 60 Minutes interviewed every extremist who was too radical for the Biden Admin and had to resign. The show is a parade of Palestinian sycophants. This guy wanted Jews to be content with mere sympathies over October 7 victims and not to fight back. Fck no.pic.twitter.com/MeqN7HTUhN &mdash; Marina Medvin (@MarinaMedvin) January 13, 2025 AJC also denounced the CBS show for promoting the 'outlandish notion' that, after Hamas’s atrocities in southern Israel, the Jewish state should have made efforts to make peace with the Palestinian terrorist group rather than engage in self-defense to rescue the hostages taken to Gaza and target the Hamas terrorists who threatened to perpetrate similar deadly massacres in the future. 'This segment, the latest example of major news outlets recklessly reporting on Israel’s defensive war against Hamas, was shockingly one-sided, lacked factual accuracy, and relied heavily on misguided information,' AJC added. 'In this segment, ‘60 Minutes’ plays directly into the hands of the enemies of the West who aim to show that support for Israel is not in the United States’ best interest. Nothing could be further from the truth,' AJC noted. 'Israel’s actions against Iranian-backed terror groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, as well as its recent direct responses to Iranian attacks, help deter attacks on the US. Each of these terror organizations has American blood on its hands. We share common enemies — the enemies of democracy and freedom.' AJC CEO Ted Deutch said in a separate statement on X that the '60 Minutes' segment on Sunday night 'relies on the same biased accusations and information that attempt to demonize and delegitimize Israel.' 'The one-sided segment plays into the hands of enemies of democracy and freedom who aim to divide the US and Israel,' he added. 'It is shocking to see this kind of irresponsible journalism from a long-running, respected news program like ’60 Minutes.'' Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), said in a post on X he is 'outraged' that '60 Minutes' would 'air such a biased and one-sided piece, villainizing Israel and berating US support for its ally.' 'Where are the counter perspectives to those interviewed? Where is the mention of the nearly 100 hostages — including Americans — STILL in captivity!? What kind of journalism is that?' he wrote. 'According to last night’s piece, Israel should have responded to the mass slaughter, mutilation, rape, and kidnapping of its citizens by asking the perpetrators of these vicious crimes for peace. Newsflash: Rewarding terrorism won’t bring peace. And this sort of biased coverage only serves to fuel hate. It’s like a blood libel in a moment of expanding, intensifying antisemitism.' 'Responsible coverage of the war should not only honor the lives lost, but also accurately describe those responsible for this conflict for what they are — antisemitic terrorists,' he concluded. Honest Reporting, a Jerusalem-based media watchdog that focuses on antisemitism and anti-Israel bias, released a detailed report on Monday of all the 'skewed' and 'imbalanced' reporting included in the '60 Minutes' segment. It revealed that the investigative news program amplified anti-Israel voices in the segment on Sunday night while failing to mention that two of its interviewees have 'a history of anti-Israel activism and associations with anti-Israel organizations,' including the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN). Honest Reporting claimed '60 Minutes' tried to disguise these two former State Department officials — Josh Paul, a former director in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs; and Hala Rharrit, a former American diplomat who specialized in the Middle East — as 'impartial observers,' when in reality they are anti-Israel activists. US Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) wrote on X that '60 Minutes' aired 'a disgraceful hit job against Israel,' and 'forgot that Hamas started the war, Hamas still holds American hostages, and any damage in Gaza is the sole fault of Hamas.' Others who have condemned the '60 Minutes' segment include Jewish actor Michael Rapaport, who described the segment as a 'smear campaign' against Israel and the show as a 'propaganda machine.' Dozens on social media have called the segment 'despicable,' labeled it as 'a hit piece vilifying Israel,' and accused '60 Minutes' of defending Hamas.

Yeshiva University president, controversial imam to give Trump in...	It is a profound privilege to offer a prayer of unity and hope on behalf of Yeshiva University and for all Americans at this historic moment,' said Rabbi Berman. By Mike Wagenheim, JNS The leader of America’s flagship Jewish university will give a benediction following Donald Trump’s inaugural presidential address on Jan. 20. So, too, will an imam who refused to label Hezbollah a terrorist organization. A program showing the lineup for Trump’s inauguration at the Capitol indicates that Rabbi Ari Berman, president of Yeshiva University in New York City, and Imam Husham Al-Husainy of the Karbalaa Islamic Center in Dearborn, Mich., will take the podium back to back immediately following Trump’s speech. They are two of four religious leaders who have been selected for the honor. 'Working on the benediction for the inauguration,' Berman wrote on X, with a picture of him at a desk, pen in hand, with a pad of paper and a thick book in front of him: 'It is a profound privilege to offer a prayer of unity and hope on behalf of Yeshiva University and for all Americans at this historic moment.' Berman has served as Yeshiva University’s fifth president since 2016, during which time the institution has experienced significant growth in several key categories. Al-Husainy, who was among the Arab and Muslim leaders the Trump campaign leaned on during the 2024 election, has declined to call Hezbollah a terror organization and attended a 2006 pro-Hezbollah rally in Dearborn during Israel’s conflict with the southern Lebanese-based Iranian proxy. The Middle East Forum reported that Al-Husainy held up a photo of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah on the stage at the rally. Nasrallah was eliminated by an Israeli bunker-busting strike near Beirut this past September. Al-Husainy was invited by Democrats the following year to give an invocation at the national committee’s winter meeting, during which he prayed that God would 'help us to stop the war and violence, and oppression and occupation' in Iraq. (JNS sought comment from the Trump transition team.) Critics said Al-Husainy was referring to the United States military as an oppressor. While Al-Husainy denied it, he did not explain who he was referring to during an interview on Fox News that year. When asked during that interview if Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, Al-Husainy said, 'No.' 'Hezbollah is a Lebanese organization,' he said. 'And I’ve got nothing to do with that. But there is a biblical meaning of Hezbollah. It is in Judaism and Christianity and Islam, meaning people of God.'

Days before leaving office, Biden extends sanctions on Israeli se...	With less than a week left in office, President Biden signs order extending sanctions against a list of Israeli Jews living in Judea and Samaria, accusing them of 'extremism' which threatens American foreign policy and the two-state solution. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden signed an order Tuesday night extending sanctions against a number of Israeli Jews living in Judea and Samaria deemed 'extremist' by the Biden administration. The move comes less than a week before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration and the end of Biden's four years in office. Biden first signed an executive order enabling federal authorities to freeze the assets of and bar transactions on behalf of individuals flagged by the administration as 'extremist Israeli settlers' on February 1st, 2024. The executive order was issued in response to claims by left-wing NGOs in Israel and reports by the United Nations accusing Israeli residents of Judea and Samaria of violence and harassment against Palestinian Arabs after October 7th. On Tuesday, Biden issued a statement announcing that he had signed an order extending the sanctions for another year, calling the alleged actions of the sanctioned settlers as a 'unusual and extraordinary threat' to American national security and foreign policy. 'The situation in the West Bank — in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction — has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region,' Biden argued. 'These actions undermine the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution and ensuring Israelis and Palestinians can attain equal measures of security, prosperity, and freedom.' 'They also undermine the security of Israel and have the potential to lead to broader regional destabilization across the Middle East, threatening United States personnel and interests.' 'The situation in the West Bank continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.'

Ahead of inauguration, Trump gets high marks from Israeli Jews	Two-thirds of Israeli Jews pleased Trump will be taking office next week, with moderately high levels of confidence he will properly handle key issues including Iran, the Israeli-Arab conflict, and US-Israel relations. By World Israel News Staff Over two-thirds of Israeli Jews are looking forward to President-elect Donald Trump taking office next week, according to a new poll published on Tuesday. Ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration as President of the United States next Tuesday, and in light of reports that he is exerting significant pressure to broker a deal to end the war in Israel and secure the release of hostages, the 'Israeli Society Index' survey, conducted by the Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI), examined what the Israeli public thinks about the incoming president. The data shows that the majority of all Israelis (61%) are pleased that Donald Trump will be returning to the White House. By contrast, 28% of Israelis expressed dissatisfaction with Trump's return to office. When broken down by political orientation, the survey reveals that among those who identify as right-wing, 96% are satisfied, while among those who identify as left-wing, 76% are dissatisfied. Among Jewish citizens of Israel, 68% are satisfied, and 24% are dissatisfied. In contrast, among Arab citizens of Israel, 32% are satisfied, while 43% are dissatisfied. The survey also examined respondents' confidence in Trump’s ability to 'do the right thing' regarding U.S.-Israel relations: 32% of Israelis expressed high confidence, 40% reported moderate confidence, and 21% stated they do not believe Trump will act appropriately. The research included a comparison with the opinions of American Jews about Trump, as measured by JPPI’s 'Voice of the People' panel. The study found that Israeli Jews place more trust in Trump than American Jews do: 77% of Israeli Jews expressed confidence (high or moderate) in Trump’s handling of U.S.-Israel relations, compared to only 54% of American Jews. Respondents were also asked whether they believe Trump will handle Iran effectively. Only 20% of Israelis expressed 'high confidence' in Trump’s ability to act appropriately, 44% reported 'moderate confidence,' and roughly a quarter (27%) said they do not trust him to act properly in dealing with Iran. In contrast to other issues, American Jews expressed greater confidence in Trump on Iran policy than Israeli Jews. On the Israeli-Palestinian issue, one-third (34%) of Israelis indicated they lack confidence that Trump will do the right thing, 43% expressed moderate confidence, and only 13% reported high confidence in Trump regarding this issue.

Families of fallen soldiers, hostages protest ‘surrender’ deal	We won’t forget, we won’t forgive. You don’t have a mandate to surrender to Hamas,' says protest organizer. By World Israel News Staff Hundreds of demonstrators gathered near the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem on Tuesday night, calling on the Israeli government to reject the potential ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas. The agreement would see thousands of terrorists freed, including those serving life sentences for murdering Israelis, and a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for the release of 34 hostages, an unknown number of whom are alive. The protesters, many of whom are the family members of fallen soldiers and hostages, say that the current deal abandons the vast majority of captives, including all healthy young men under the age of 50. The first stage of the deal would see the release of all women currently held, along with men over the age of 50 and those with critical medical conditions. Under the terms of the deal, the return of men under 50 and dead bodies are matters to be negotiated later. 'We demand that agreements to be made now promising everyone's return, not in the future,' said Lishay Lavi Miran, whose husband Omri was kidnapped on October 7h. 'Time has not been on our side for a long while.' 'We are calling on the prime minister not to give into this deal… a deal that will free thousands of terrorists with blood on their hands,' a representative from the Gvura Forum, which organized the protest, said over a loudspeaker. 'We won’t forget, we won’t forgive. You don’t have a mandate to surrender to Hamas.' Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Weitzen, whose IDF soldier son was killed battling Hamas terrorists on October 7th, urged Israel to continue the fight against Hamas. 'When you have an enemy who is evil to you, you lay siege to it. You don’t need to do anything aside from that. To lay siege, to fight, to stop the electricity,' he said. 'Then, maybe the evil will understand, and get down on its knees and beg to return us hostages back to us.' Weitzen referred to the fight against Hamas a 'struggle between good and evil.' Amitai Wiesel, whose brother Elkana fell in combat in the Strip in January 2024, referenced a speech made by Netanyahu that categorized the war in similar terms. 'I remember, as if it were today, one of your first [press conferences] at the start of the war. You called this war a war between the children of light and children of darkness,' Wiesel said, in remarks aimed at Netanyahu. 'I ask you today, Mr. Prime Minister, what happened to the children of light and the children of darkness? Did something change so that you started to talk with the children of darkness?'

Blinken: Hamas regrouping, losses offset by new recruits	Washington believes that Hamas has 'recruited almost as many new' terrorists as it has lost in the ongoing war, Blinken said. By World Israel News Staff Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that Israel would not be able to maintain its military achievements in Gaza without supporting a new governing body for the Strip, claiming that the Hamas terror group has recruited enough new terrorists to replace nearly all of its operatives killed during the war. In a two-hour long speech at the Atlantic Council on Tuesday, Blinken said that the Biden Administration had pushed Israel to embrace a post-war vision for Gaza that included alternative leadership, including the Palestinian Authority. Blinken charged that Israel's hesitancy to promote new governance in the coastal enclave had created a power vacuum, which served Hamas' interests. 'Each time Israel completes its military operations and pulls back, Hamas militants regroup and reemerge because there’s nothing else to fill the void,' Blinken said. 'Indeed, we assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost,' he added. 'That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war.' While Blinken touched on Hamas' crimes against its own people, pointing to a Wall Street Journal interview in which Yahya Sinwar called the deaths of Gazans 'necessary sacrifices,' the diplomat turned his attention to slamming Israel's policies in Judea and Samaria. 'Israelis must abandon the myth that they can carry out de facto annexation [of Judea and Samaria without cost and consequence to Israel’s democracy, to its standing and to its security,' Blinken said. 'Israel is expanding official settlements and nationalizing land at a faster clip than any time in the last decade, while turning a blind eye to unprecedented growth in illegal outposts. Violent attacks by extremist settlers against Palestinian civilians have reached record levels,' he claimed. Blinken concluded his remarks by alleging that there is a lack of sufficient media coverage in Israel about the humanitarian crisis in the Strip, drawing a moral equivalency to the widespread celebration of the October 7th terror attacks in the Islamic world. 'Throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds, large majorities believe that October 7 didn’t happen — or if it did, that it was a legitimate attack on Israel’s military,' Blinken said.

Will ICC warrants be dismissed due to bureaucratic errors?	Israel argued that Khan had not given the country formal notice of the ICC investigation, nor sufficient time to respond to the probe. By World Israel News Staff International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan expressed his objection on Tuesday to an appeal of the warrants issued against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, but numerous bureaucratic issues may render the warrants invalid. In November 2024, the ICC approved the warrants, sparking condemnation from Israel and its ally, the United States. With incoming president-elect Donald Trump and Congress signaling that they will take punitive action against the ICC and its staff, along with several European countries stating they will reject the warrants, the ICC may be considering dropping the warrants. But international pressure from numerous pro-Palestinian groups may prevent the Court from formally cancelling the warrants. Bureaucratic issues raised by Israel in its appeal of the warrants could potentially provide an off-ramp for the ICC, allowing them to withdraw the warrants while saving face. In the appeal, Israel argued that Khan had not given the country formal notice of the ICC investigation, nor sufficient time to respond to the probe. Khan's objection to that claim, which was published on Tuesday, was that he had warned Israel several times in public statements over the years that he was looking into the possibility that Jerusalem was committing war crimes. A 2021 notice, issued shortly after the Guardian of the Walls conflict, constitutes adequate warning, Khan contended. Because Khan accused Israel of 'starvation' in Gaza, Jerusalem argued, he needed to officially inform Israel of that accusation and give the government enough time to prepare a response. Another issued raised by Israel is that Jerusalem, like the U.S., is not a signatory of the Rome statute. Therefore, Israel argued, the court does not have jurisdiction over the Jewish State. A lower court within the ICC could re-examine the issues raised by Israel and Khan, which would delay a potential criminal case against Netanyahu and Gallant, or possibly lead to the expiration of the warrants.

On Tuesday, Netanyahu offered the ministers, among other things, tightened security and increased construction in Judea and Samaria. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has offered a deal to cabinet members who oppose the hostage deal, provided that they remain in the government, according to Kan news reports. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich threatened to leave the government over their disagreement with the current hostage release plan. On Tuesday, Netanyahu offered the ministers, among other things, tightened security and increased construction in Judea and Samaria. Ben Gvir had threatened to leave the government over his opposition to the hostage deal and invited Smotrich to do the same. Although Ben Gvir boasted that he was able to use his political influence to 'repeatedly prevent this deal from being implemented,' he added that 'others have aligned with the government and, by supporting the deal, we are no longer a decisive factor.' Therefore, he approached Smotrich and said, 'I am urging you, my friend, to join me in opposing the surrender deal with Hamas. The Religious Zionism party alone cannot stop this agreement. I propose that we approach the Prime Minister together and make it clear that if he pushes forward with the deal, we will withdraw from the government.' Ben Gvir and Smotrich feel that the hostage release deal threatens Israel's security and would mean that 'hundreds of soldiers died in vain.' Ben Gvir said, 'The emerging deal is catastrophic. I know the details all too well: the release of hundreds of murderous terrorists from prison, the return of Gazans to Gaza—among them, thousands of terrorists to the northern part of the strip—the withdrawal of the IDF from the Netzarim Corridor, and the re-establishment of the threat to the residents of the Gaza Envelope.' He added, 'This deal would erase the hard-earned gains of the war, bought at the high cost of our soldiers' blood. What's even worse, not all the hostages will be freed, and it effectively condemns the remaining hostages to death.'

Hostage families ask Defense Minister Katz ‘Why are you making a ...	Many of those present were critical of the phased release of hostages and wanted assurances that all of the captives would be freed. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Family members of hostages interrupted a presentation by Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee (FADC) on Tuesday, and many were angrily critical of the current hostage deal that may be finalized within days. The hostage family members spoke, interrupting the meeting for 30 minutes as Katz and Likud MK Yuli Edelstein sat in silence. Many of those present were critical of the phased release of hostages and wanted assurances that all of the captives would be freed. Chana Cohen, The aunt of one of the hostages whose daughter died in Hamas captivity, exclaimed, 'Where is my daughter? Why is she not on the list?' She added, 'I want to bury my daughter in a Jewish cemetery.' Cohen continued, 'You cannot continue to live here. I will not let you speak today. Go from here, and instead of speaking about money, bring me my daughter.' she added, '&#8230;it is all according to a pre-negotiated list.' Many of the family members kept saying, 'You have selected some hostages to live and some to die.' One person yelled, 'At Auschwitz, there was selection off the train' of who would live and who would die.' Katz emphasized that although 33 hostages will be released in the first phase of the deal, he is committed to releasing all of the hostage according to the agreement. Cohen responded, 'Committed? How many more years? Why are you making a Schindler's List?' Danny Elgarat, brother of hostage Itzik Elgarat, had harsh words for the Defense Minister. 'Here sits a man accountable for selecting the hostages, responsible for the abandonment of 70 hostages in Gaza. He is the defense minister—but where is the defense? In truth, he is the minister of abandonment,' Elgarat said. The hearing ended half an hour earlier than scheduled, after which Katz embraced the family members even as they continued to criticize him.

Turkish chief rabbi dead at 84	According to local media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called leaders of the Jewish community to convey his condolences. By JNS Turkish Chief Rabbi Ishak Haleva died on Tuesday at the age of 84 after serving for 23 years in the position, the country’s Chief Rabbinate said. 'We mourn the departure of our hakham bashi [chief rabbi], Ishak Haleva, who always believed in unity, peace, and love. He led our community with this belief for many years,' the body stated. Haleva became the chief rabbi of the Muslim-majority nation in 2002, succeeding Chief Rabbi David Asseo. During his tenure, Haleva also served on the Presidium Council of the Alliance of Rabbis in Islamic States and taught Jewish history and Hebrew at Turkish universities. The Istanbul-based Alliance of Rabbis in Islamic States mourned Haleva as 'our rabbi and teacher, member and president of the Alliance of Rabbis in Islamic States, the leader of Turkish Jewry, the chief rabbi.' Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the rabbi would be remembered as 'a great leader and educator, a man who not only led the historic Jewish community in Turkey, but was a champion of dialogue and friendship between peoples of all faiths, especially between Jews and Muslims.' The legacy of Haleva, who was born in Istanbul in 1940 and received his education at Jerusalem’s Sephardic Porat Yosef Yeshivah, 'will serve as a guiding light for many generations to come,' he added. 'I will never forget the moving moments of prayer we shared together with the community at the synagogue in Istanbul when they hosted me there a few years ago,' stated Herzog in a social media post. According to local media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called leaders of the Jewish community to convey his condolences. Though the vast majority of Turkish Jews have immigrated to Israel in recent decades, the country still has a Jewish population estimated at 15,000 to 20,000 people, the vast majority of whom live in Istanbul. Non-Muslim citizens of Turkey, including Jews, suffer from institutional violations of their freedom of religion, according to a 2022 report. Erdoğan has become more hostile toward Israel and closer to Hamas since the terrorist group’s assault on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. In May, the Turkish leader called Netanyahu a 'vampire who feeds on blood,' and urged Muslims to fight the Jewish state. Two months later, Erdoğan told Newsweek that Palestinian terrorists from the Gaza Strip were 'simply defending their homes, streets and homeland' on Oct. 7.

Israeli lawmakers split on ceasefire deal, hostage release terms	Under the terms of the emerging ceasefire, it is expected that the first 33 hostages to be released will be humanitarian cases — women, children, elderly and sick. By Sveta Listratov, TPSUnder the terms of the emerging ceasefire, it is expected that the first 33 hostages to be released will be humanitarian cases — women, children, elderly and sick. Knesset members were divided over an emerging ceasefire and hostage agreement with Hamas on Tuesday. Supporters insisted it was necessary to bring the captives home as soon as possible while critics said the deal threatened Israeli security. 'All our hostages must be returned in one operation,' Likud MK Tali Gottlieb insisted to The Press Service of Israel. 'I’m not debating the cost, and as long as Herzi Halevi remains Chief of Staff [of the Israel Defense Forces], he won’t allow Hamas to be defeated. Instead, he continues with raids rather than conquest and control of enemy territory,' she added. 'So, it has to be all or nothing. No phased releases, no steps. Either everyone returns, or no one does. Hamas can wait for Trump’s presidency, when we will impose such a heavy siege on them that they will beg to return our hostages.' Opposition Whip MK Merav Ben Ari of Yesh Atid told TPS-IL she supported the agreement. 'The State of Israel must bring all the hostages home, whether for rehabilitation or burial in Israel. The hostages don’t have time. Every day is critical. We must bring them back and end the war in Gaza,' she said. But fellow opposition MK Yulia Malinovsky of the Israel Beitinenu party told TPS-IL she opposed the agreement. 'Months ago, a comprehensive deal could have been reached to bring all the hostages home, both the living and the dead,' Malinovsky said. 'But the Prime Minister, due to political weakness and personal interests, prevented this. Now we’re talking about a phased deal, with no guarantee that everyone will return. I still believe it’s possible to find a formula that brings everyone back in one operation. I’m crossing my fingers and hope that all our brothers and sisters return home as soon as possible, whether for recovery or burial.' Coalition MK Ohad Tal of the Religious Zionism party told TPS-IL, 'We say no to a deal that leaves most hostages in Gaza, no to a deal that frees murderous terrorists, and no to a deal that rolls back the war achievements for which soldiers gave their lives. But yes to military pressure that will force Hamas into a good deal. Yes to a deal that includes all the hostages, allows Israel to maintain its presence in Gaza, and doesn’t compromise Israel’s security.' MK Tzvi Sukkot of Otzma Yehudit said the deal 'means abandoning hostages who aren’t included in the agreement.' He was referring to reports that 33 hostages — women, children, elderly and sick — will be released while the freeing of other captives will be subject to further negotiations. 'It’s a betrayal of Israel’s security and erases the war’s achievements, paid for with the lives of many soldiers. For every hostage released, we’ll be freeing dozens of terrorists just like Yahya Sinwar, taking Israel back to October 6,' Sukkot insisted. 'This must not happen. If we cut Hamas off from humanitarian aid, implement the Generals’ Plan to clear Gaza of terrorists, and begin annexing Gaza territories, Hamas will beg for a deal and return the hostages without undermining our security or war gains.' The Generals’ Plan advocates evacuating all civilians from northern Gaza, designating the area as a closed military zone, and forcing the remaining terrorists to capitulate by cutting off all aid, including food and water. Yesh Atid lawmaker Debbie Biton insisted to TPS-IL, 'No excuses, no delays — the hostages must come home. Their lives are more important than any politics or other considerations. Yesh Atid is here to provide a safety net for any deal that saves them. Netanyahu needs to find the courage to finalize the deal he agreed to seven months ago. This is the time to restore hope to the families and act without fear.' Talks in Qatar aimed at reaching a ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas are progressing with an Arab source telling The Press Service of Israel on Tuesday there is a 'high likelihood of success.' According to the source, discussions focus on the release of Palestinian prisoners, with Israel seeking to have those serving life sentences deported to countries such as Turkey, Qatar, and Egypt. Under the terms of the emerging ceasefire, it is expected that the first 33 hostages to be released will be humanitarian cases — women, children, elderly and sick. Palestinians from northern Gaza who fled to southern areas of the Strip will be allowed to return to their homes. Israeli forces will not withdraw from the Strip until all the hostages are freed. Opponents of the agreement are against any deal that does not bring home all the hostages at once. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 95 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Major shift at ICJ as pro-Israel judge poised for presidency	Her appointment to the ICJ in February 2012 broke new ground as she became the first woman from Africa to serve on the court. By Israel Hayom Judge Julia Sebutinde is set to assume the presidency of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), marking another milestone in her groundbreaking career as well as a significant shift for the court. The Ugandan jurist, who recently made headlines for her robust defense of Israel against South Africa’s genocide allegations, will take the helm following current President Nawaf Salam’s departure to form Lebanon’s next government. Born Julia Semusso in February 1954 in Uganda’s Central Province to a civil servant father and homemaker mother, Sebutinde’s journey to The Hague reflects a remarkable career. Her ascent began with her 1996 appointment to Uganda’s Supreme Court, where she distinguished herself by leading three pivotal anti-corruption investigations in her homeland. The judge’s international prominence grew with her 2005 appointment to the Special Court for Sierra Leone war crimes tribunal, where she played a crucial role in the landmark trial of Liberian President Charles Taylor. Her appointment to the ICJ in February 2012 broke new ground as she became the first woman from Africa to serve on the court. Sebutinde’s recent ruling on the Israel-Hamas war has particularly resonated in international legal circles. She dismissed South Africa’s requests for temporary injunctions to halt the Gaza war, asserting that the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people is fundamentally political rather than legal in both its nature and historical context, and therefore falls outside the court’s purview. Her stance, however, has created diplomatic ripples. Uganda’s U.N. Ambassador Adonia Ayebare publicly distanced his government from her position, emphasizing that her ICJ decision does not reflect Uganda’s official stance. The transition in leadership comes at a crucial juncture, with Israel scheduled to present its defense brief against South Africa’s case in July. According to the court’s statutory framework, the president – elected every three years through a panel member vote – oversees the institution’s administrative affairs and chairs its panels, wielding a decisive vote in cases of judicial deadlock. The Lebanese parliament’s recent acceptance of newly elected President Joseph Aoun’s request to task Salam with government formation has necessitated this change in ICJ leadership. As Salam steps down, the United Nations faces the additional task of selecting a new judge to represent the Asia region on the court. Sebutinde and Salam were both elected to their ICJ positions in February 2024, making this rapid transition particularly noteworthy in the court’s history. Her elevation to the presidency not only marks a personal achievement but also comes at a critical time for international justice and Middle East diplomacy.

Report: Hamas has agreed to terms of hostage deal	Hamas terror organization has reportedly accepted a proposed hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire, while Israel mulls the latest draft. By World Israel News Staff The politburo of the Hamas terror organization has accepted the latest draft of a proposed ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, during which Israeli hostages would be freed in exchange for the release of hundreds of jailed Palestinian terrorists, The Associated Press reported Tuesday afternoon. According to the report, which cited two officials involved in the negotiations, the efforts to secure a deal are now nearly completion, and could be determined by Israel's response to the latest proposal. 'Today, we are at the closest point ever to having a deal,' said Majed al-Ansari, a spokesman for the Qatari Foreign Ministry, saying the two sides have 'overcome the major differences.' 'We have handed over drafts of the ceasefire agreement to both sides, and talks are now ongoing on the final detail.' Hamas said in a statement Tuesday that talks were now in their 'final stage.' An Israeli official who spoke with AP, however, downplayed the claim, saying only that progress had been made, while adding that the details of a final agreement had yet to be hammered out. AP claimed to have obtained a copy of the tentative agreement, which was verified by an Egyptian official and a member of Hamas. Multiple sources who spoke with The Jerusalem Post said a deal could be announced in the next 24 hours, barring any last minute surprises. 'The next 24 hours will be pivotal to reaching the deal,' one official said. According to a report by the BBC Tuesday, if the current proposal is adopted, Hamas will release three Israeli hostages on the first day of the ceasefire, with another four slated to be released in the following week. In total, 33-34 Israeli hostages are expected to be freed during the first phase of a ceasefire, in exchange for the release of over 1,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, including 190 serving life sentences.

Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for a Gaza ceasefire and the...	Today, we are at the closest point ever to having a deal,' Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said at a weekly briefing Tuesday. By The Associated Press Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of dozens of hostages, two officials involved in the talks said Tuesday. Mediator Qatar said the negotiations were at the 'closest point' yet to sealing a deal. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the proposed agreement, and an Egyptian official and a Hamas official confirmed its authenticity. An Israeli official said progress has been made, but the details are being finalized. The plan would need to be submitted to the Israeli Cabinet for final approval. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent the past year trying to mediate an end the 15-month war and secure the release of dozens of hostages captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered it. Some 100 Israelis are still captive inside Gaza, and the military believes at least a third them are dead. Officials have expressed mounting optimism that they can conclude an agreement ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose Mideast envoy has joined the negotiations. Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said at a weekly briefing Tuesday that the ongoing negotiations are positive and productive, while declining to get into the details of the sensitive talks. 'Today, we are at the closest point ever to having a deal,' he said. Hamas, meanwhile, said in a statement that the ongoing negotiations had reached their 'final stage.' A three-phase agreement The three-phase agreement — based on a framework laid out by U.S. President Joe Biden and endorsed by the U.N. Security Council — would begin with the gradual release of 33 hostages over a six-week period, including women, children, older adults and wounded civilians in exchange for potentially hundreds of Palestinian women and children imprisoned by Israel. Among the 33 would be five female Israeli soldiers, each of whom would be released in exchange for 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 convicted terrorists who are serving life sentences. By the end of the first phase, all civilian captives — living or dead — will have been released. During this first, 42-day phase, Israeli forces would withdraw from population centers, Palestinians would be allowed to start returning to their homes in northern Gaza and there would be a surge of humanitarian aid, with some 600 trucks entering each day. Details of the second phase still must be negotiated during the first. Those details remain difficult to resolve — and the deal does not include written guarantees that the ceasefire will continue until a deal is reached. That leaves the potential for Israel to resume its military campaign after the first phase ends. The three mediators, however, have given Hamas verbal guarantees that negotiations will continue as planned and that they will press for a deal to implement the second and third phases before the end of the first, the Egyptian official said. The deal would allow Israel throughout the first phase to remain in control of the Philadelphi Corridor, the band of territory along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas had initially demanded Israel withdraw from. But Israel would pull out from the Netzarim Corridor, a belt across central Gaza where it had sought a mechanism for searching Palestinians for arms when they return to the territory's north. In the second phase, Hamas would release the remaining living captives, mainly male soldiers, in exchange for more prisoners and the 'complete withdrawal' of Israeli forces from Gaza, according to the draft agreement. But Hamas has said it will not free the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in the past vowed to resume fighting unless Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are eliminated. Unless an alternative government for Gaza is worked out in those talks, it could leave Hamas in charge of the territory. In a third phase, the bodies of remaining hostages would be returned in exchange for a three- to five-year reconstruction plan to be carried out in Gaza under international supervision. Growing pressure ahead of Trump's inauguration Israel and Hamas have come under renewed pressure to halt the conflict in the lead-up to Trump's inauguration next week. His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, recently joined U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators in the Gulf country’s capital, Doha. Trump said late Monday that a ceasefire was 'very close.' 'I understand &#8230; there’s been a handshake and they are getting it finished — and maybe by the end of the week,' he told the American cable channel Newsmax. Israel and its close ally the United States have blamed setbacks on Hamas. Hamas-led terrorists killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted another 250. Around half those hostages were freed during a brief ceasefire in November 2023.

Seven hostages to be released in first week of ceasefire – report	Meanwhile the PA is reportedly insisting on ruling Gaza without Hamas on the 'day after.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Three hostages are to be released on the first day an Israel-Hamas deal goes into effect, the BBC reported Tuesday, citing a Palestinian official with knowledge of the negotiations. Immediately afterwards, the IDF will begin withdrawing from populated areas of Gaza, said the official. Another four people will be freed the following week, in exchange for which residents of northern Gaza will be allowed to start returning to their homes. A massive number of Palestinian security prisoners will be freed from Israeli jails as Hamas releases a total of 34 hostages in the first stage. Out of 1,000 prisoners, fully 190 will be hardened terrorists who have already served over 15 years of their sentences, said the official. Hamas has allegedly agreed to the IDF staying for some six weeks in an 800-meter-wide zone in the Philadelphi Corridor between Gaza and Egypt, which Israel considers the terrorists’ weapons pipeline. According to Ynet, the first hostages to be released will be women and children, then older men and some younger ones. There are some younger men who have chronic illnesses and can be considered 'humanitarian' cases, as the others are. While all of these hostages are supposedly alive, the report said that Israel is prepared to receive bodies as well. This would leave alive in captivity at least 22 Israelis, all young men, among them four soldiers, two pairs of brothers of seven in total forcibly taken from their kibbutz homes, and 11 who were kidnapped from the Nova festival. Several foreign workers, including eight Thais and one from Nepal, are also still considered to be alive, although Hamas has never released any evidence of this. Negotiations for their return, as well as for the 36 hostages already known to be dead, is to start on Day 16 of the first stage. In parallel to the hostage negotiations, inter-Arab discussions are being held about the 'day after' Israel pulls out from the Gaza Strip, if such a final stage of an agreement can be reached. An Egyptian source who is involved in talks being held in Egypt with the Palestinian Authority (PA) told Kan News that Cairo had tried to convince the PA to establish a joint committee with Hamas to oversee civilian affairs. However, the PA is insisting on running Gaza alone, without any Hamas participation, the source said, because Ramallah does not trust the Islamists, who are trying to destabilize the Authority in Judea and Samaria 'and introduce an Iranian agenda there,' the report said. Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar has reported that Egypt and Qatar have given guarantees that Hamas will not rule the Gaza Strip again. Jerusalem has so far held firm against the PA being in charge of Gaza, considering the nationalist Palestinians just as pro-terror as their Islamic brothers in Gaza.

Assad torture chief gunned down in Syrian street	We will not hesitate to hold accountable the criminals, murderers, security and army officers involved in torturing the Syrian people,' the new Syrian leader Al-Sharaa said. By Jewish Breaking News Syria’s fallen dictator Bashar Al Assad didn’t slaughter his people on his own. His brutal reign was enforced through a vast network of local officials and informants thirsting for innocent blood. One of those men was Mazen Kneneh. Described by the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights as 'one of the best-known loyalists of the former regime,' Kneneh was the Mayor of the Syrian city of Dummar. He was responsible for the torture of thousands of young men in Assad’s notorious prison system. On Friday, his life came to an abrupt end when fighters linked to Syria’s new Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) administration shot him in the head on a public street. Kneneh’s bloodied body was left tied to a tree trunk for onlookers to see, AFP reports. While HTS leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa has offered amnesty to military conscripts, he’s also promised to pursue Assad’s most notorious henchmen. 'We will not hesitate to hold accountable the criminals, murderers, security and army officers involved in torturing the Syrian people,' Al-Sharaa said. 'We will offer rewards to anyone who provides information about senior army and security officers involved in war crimes.' He has already made high-profile arrests, including former military official Mohammed Kanjo Hassan, who was responsible for issuing death sentences in Syria’s notorious Sednaya prison. Situated roughly 20 miles to the north of Damascus, Sednaya prison has since emerged as a powerful emblem of Assad’s savagery. According to Amnesty International estimates, the facility held up to 20,000 people at its peak, comprising of two distinct buildings – the 'red building' primarily housed civilian prisoners while the 'white building' generally reserved for Syrian military officers and soldiers. Former inmates describe to Amnesty being kept in complete darkness, with floors covered in blood and perspiration. Guards would seize blankets and clothing if prisoners dared to speak or rest 'without permission,' and family members were forced to torture one another under threat of execution. The Association of Detainees and Missing Persons in Syria estimates that over 30,000 individuals died there through execution, torture, inadequate medical care, and starvation.

Trump’s Israel agenda: Immediate critical decisions await	The incoming administration’s approach encompasses multiple strategies: stringent American sanctions, enhanced Israeli-American military collaboration and the potential formation of a broader international coalition. By Ariel Kahana, JNS As Donald Trump prepares to reclaim the White House in seven days, an extensive portfolio of international and domestic challenges awaits—with Israel’s security concerns commanding significant attention. Unlike his first term, Trump enters office on Jan. 20 following methodical preparation and with a clear grasp of both priorities and implementation strategies. The Iranian nuclear threat stands as the foremost security concern. Having withdrawn from the nuclear agreement in 2018 during his previous term, Trump demonstrates acute awareness of the immediate danger Tehran represents. Two assassination attempts by the ayatollah’s regime have only reinforced his determination for a swift resolution. The incoming administration’s approach encompasses multiple strategies: stringent American sanctions, enhanced Israeli-American military collaboration and the potential formation of a broader international coalition. Operational and military support The ammunition shortage crisis, stemming from the Biden administration’s restrictions on certain munitions, heads Israel’s immediate requirements. Trump’s transition team has indicated plans for comprehensive removal of these restrictions and expedited military shipments to the Israel Defense Forces within the first 48 hours after his inauguration. The Gaza war presents another urgent priority. The incoming president has articulated a more definitive stance on concluding the war—following an Israeli victory—than has the current Israeli leadership. While an immediate cessation is not expected, Trump’s team anticipates resolution within months. The administration plans to request that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu provide a detailed strategic roadmap for bringing the campaign to its conclusion. Diplomatic and legal initiatives In what would be a significant move against international legal pressure targeting Israel, Trump plans immediate action regarding the International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC). As reported by Israel Hayom, comprehensive sanctions will target the institution and its personnel, including economic restrictions and U.S. entry bans. This executive action parallels congressional initiatives for stringent legislation against the court and its collaborators. The administration also plans to swiftly address the Biden-era sanctions affecting Israeli citizens, particularly those targeting Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria and Tzav 9 movement leaders who opposed Hamas supply transfers. Trump’s team has committed to removing these restrictions during their initial days in office. Regional dynamics and strategic relationships The completion of the Abraham Accords through Israeli-Saudi normalization remains a shared objective, though significant challenges persist. Saudi Arabia’s nuclear development aspirations conflict with Israeli security principles, while their expectation of Israeli acknowledgment regarding a future Palestinian state faces increased resistance following the Oct. 7 massacre. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US President Donald Trump, United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Abdullatif bin Rashid Al-Zayani, Foreign Minister of Bahrain, attend the Abraham Accords Signing Ceremony at the White House in Washington, D.C., Sept. 15, 2020. (Photo by Avi Ohayon/GPO.) Israel’s strategic concerns extend to the growing influence of Muslim Brotherhood-aligned states. This includes Turkey’s expanding regional role, its Syrian protectorate and Qatar’s mounting influence in the West through sophisticated diplomacy and economic leverage. While unaddressed in initial discussions between the incoming administration and Netanyahu, these developments demand increasing attention. The Palestinian question, central to Trump’s first-term 'Deal of the Century,' now occupies a markedly lower priority. While his national security appointees largely align with Israeli right-wing positions, the president’s current stance remains undefined. Looking forward Additional bilateral matters await discussion, including Israel’s potential support for various American global initiatives. The United States also maintains its reservations about Chinese involvement in Israeli strategic investments. These issues are considerably interconnected: Addressing Iran’s nuclear program could influence Saudi nuclear ambitions, while expedited military support could accelerate conflict resolution in Gaza. Two fundamental principles warrant consideration. First, contemporary leadership typically dedicates 80% of its attention to emerging challenges rather than planned initiatives. Second, Trump—historically considered Israel’s strongest presidential ally—employs unconventional approaches and strategic surprises to achieve breakthrough results. While such behavior may emerge, it is unlikely to disadvantage Israeli interests.

National Security Council warns Israelis of escalating Iranian ki...	In November, Israeli-Moldovan Rabbi Zvi Kogan was abducted and killed in the United Arab Emirates. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s National Security Council warned citizens of escalating Iranian efforts to harm Israelis abroad on Tuesday. This follows an incident in which Iranian operatives attempted to lure an Israeli businessman to the United Arab Emirates for a potential kidnapping. According to the NSC, Iranian agents posing as representatives of Al-Arabiya Farsi, the Persian-language branch of a Saudi media outlet, contacted the businessman via Telegram. Claiming they sought an interview about the Iranian regime, they invited the Israeli to a meeting in Dubai. The agents also sent malicious files designed to access his mobile phone. But the businessman became suspicious and reported the contact to the National Intelligence Service, whose investigation confirmed the plot. In December, The Press Service of Israel reported on an Iranian plot to kidnap Israeli journalist Babak Itzhaki by luring him to a Turkish city near the Iranian border. In November, Israeli-Moldovan Rabbi Zvi Kogan was abducted and killed in the United Arab Emirates. Three Uzbek nationals were arrested and Israeli officials believe they were working on behalf of Iran. The NSC cautioned Israelis against sharing sensitive personal details, such as phone numbers, travel plans, or real-time locations, through social media or messaging platforms. When contacted by unknown individuals, the NSC recommended verifying the identity of their contacts through direct communication, such as audio or video calls. The NSC also warned against downloading unsolicited files or links.

Hostages’ relatives warn against ‘dangerous’ deal with Hamas	Hundreds of opponents of the emerging ceasefire deal staged a protest in Jerusalem on Monday night, blocking the entrance to the capital for about an hour. By Canaan Lidor, JNS Relatives of hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza on Monday urged right-wing politicians to leave the government if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agrees to a deal with the terror group that leaves some abducted Israelis in captivity. 'Unless the deal includes all the hostages unconditionally, living and dead, in one go, we call on the Religious Zionist and Otzma Yehudit parties, along with the Likud Knesset lawmakers who have so far only supported a full deal, to immediately announce that they are pulling out of the government,' the Tikva Forum of hostages’ relatives wrote. 'Any partial deal with Hamas will turn the hostages into [even more] valuable assets, and will endanger the lives of soldiers and other hostages,' the statement continued. Hundreds of opponents of the emerging ceasefire deal staged a protest in Jerusalem on Monday night, blocking the entrance to the capital for about an hour. Some protesters carried signs that read: 'No to a deal with the devil.' Among the protesters was National Missions Minister Orit Strock of the Religious Zionism Party, which along with Otzma Yehudit had previously announced its opposition to the published terms of the deal. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a different group of relatives, also wrote that it seeks a deal that would ensure the return of all the hostages. But that statement stopped short of calling on the government to reject a partial deal. The Families Forum has expressed harsher criticism of the government than Tikva and called for making greater concessions to get hostages back. The calls of both groups followed reports of a breakthrough in ceasefire talks with Hamas. The final terms of the agreement have not yet been officially announced, but reports about it, including by Israel’s Kan public broadcaster on Monday, speak of a two-phase deal that would begin with the release of 33 out of about 100 hostages believed to be in Hamas’s hands over a 42-day ceasefire. Israel would free 1,300 Palestinian terrorists and prisoners, including hundreds serving life sentences. The 33 hostages would include female soldiers, women and men over the age of 50, as well as ill and wounded hostages. How many of the 33 are still alive is unknown. The second phase of the deal would include the release of the remaining hostages and talks about a permanent ceasefire, according to Kan. The report did not include a timeframe for the second phase. According to Kan, the Israel Defense Forces would withdraw from the Philadelphia Corridor—the border separating the Gaza Strip from Egypt—at the end of the first phase. Before it attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas smuggled hundreds of tons of weapons through the corridor, which Netanyahu in August vowed would remain under Israeli control.

Gaza building collapse that killed 5 soldiers likely result of ac...	Hamas meanwhile took credit for collapsing the building. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The five soldiers from the Nahal Brigade’s Reconnaissance Battalion who were killed Monday in northern Gaza may have been victims of their own explosives, according to the initial findings of an IDF investigation. The troops were preparing to detonate a building in Beit Hanoun when a chain of charges exploded, causing the structure to collapse on them. Eight other soldiers in the battalion were seriously wounded in the explosion. While the army said that its probe is still ongoing, Hamas was quick to take credit for their deaths. Saying that the IDF has 'has hidden the true extent of its losses,' Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Obeida posted to Telegram Monday that the terrorist forces had killed 'more than' ten soldiers over the last three days. 'Our members are still dealing it harsh blows,' he said. On Saturday three other Nahal soldiers and a heavy-equipment driver of the Armored Brigade were killed and six wounded, two very seriously, in a Hamas ambush of their open jeeps traveling in a convoy through the same city. In this case, the army’s preliminary investigation showed that the terrorists set off a remote- controlled explosive device near one of the vehicles and then perhaps opened fire on the troops. Of the five killed, team leader Capt. Yair Yaakov Shushan of Ma’alot-Tarshiha was the oldest, at 23. Upon completion of his officer’s course last summer, he had received a certificate of excellence from the prime minister and the chief of staff. A close friend since early childhood, Oz Weizman, told Kan Reshet Bet that Shushan had 'lived with startling intensity,' while his high school principal called him 'brilliant and determined with a lot of humility. He knew how to connect with everyone quickly.' Staff Sgt. Guy Karmiel, 20, from Gedera, loved sports and diving and was 'a very brave boy' who had been 'extremely happy to be accepted to the Reconnaissance group, to see the most combat possible,' said his uncle, Tal Rivan. Staff Sgt. Yahav Hadar, 20, from Kfar Tavor had graduated the Nahal course with honors, said his mother, Sharon, but 'was very modest and made sure not to talk about himself. He always helped others, it was important to him to take care of his sisters and he was always concerned about their well-being.' Staff Sgt. Yoav Feffer, 19, from Herzliya, was friends with Itay Regev, a Hamas hostage who was freed in November 2023 along with 85 other Israeli minors and women. Regev said he loved Feffer 'with all his heart,' eulogizing him as one who 'would bring light into every place he entered,' and vowing to memorialize him 'in every possible way.' Staff Sgt. Aviel Wiseman, 20, was from the small village of Poria Illit near the Kinneret. Jordan Valley Regional Council head Idan Grinbaum mourned him as 'the fourth generation of a fighting family' and the 'salt of the earth.' The IDF has been fighting for weeks to clear Beit Hanoun and other areas in the northern part of Gaza of the Hamas forces that have been rebuilt there in the last several months.

Ritual altar dating back to First Temple period identified in Jer...	Study by Israel Antiquities Authority excavator suggests recently discovered complex found in the City of David was used for ritual purposes, competing with King Solomon's Temple - until King Hezekiah banned the cultic practice. By World Israel News Staff An ancient complex discovered outside the Old City of Jerusalem was likely used as a center for religious rituals during the First Temple period, according to a new study, competing with the Temple of King Solomon. The unique structure, uncovered by the Israel Antiquities Authority on the eastern slope of the City of David, within the Jerusalem Walls National Park, features eight rock-hewn rooms containing an altar, a standing stone (masseba), an oil press, and a winepress. In a new article published in the scientific journal ‘Atiqot, excavation director Eli Shukron suggests that the structure was used by the residents of Judah for cultic, religious practice. This exceptional structure, dating to the First Temple period, was revealed during excavations conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority in the City of David. The newly published article in ‘Atiqot proposes that the unique structure, comprising a series of eight rock-hewn rooms, was used for ritual purposes while the Temple still stood on the Temple Mount, just a few hundred meters away. It is the only known ritual structure from this period discovered in Jerusalem and one of the very few found in the land of Israel. The uncovered structure covers an area of approximately 220 square meters and contains eight rock-hewn rooms, each with different installations: An oil press for producing oil, a winepress for making wine, a carved installation with a drainage channel, identified by researchers as an altar, and a large standing stone (masseba), next to which ritual activity was likely practiced. One room’s floor displayed mysterious V-shaped carving marks, the purpose of which remains unclear. Reconstruction of ritual structure in the City of David. (Shalom Kveller, City of David) According to Eli Shukron, the excavator of the site, these carvings may have served as a base for a tripod—an installation with three legs used for ritual activities. In a small cave carved on the edge of the structure, a cache of objects dating to the eighth century BCE was uncovered, including cooking pots, jars bearing fragments of ancient Hebrew inscriptions, loom weights, scarabs, stamped seals with decorative motifs, and grinding stones used for crushing grains. The authors of the article from the Center for Research on Ancient Jerusalem, led by archaeologist Eli Shukron, who directed the excavation on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, believe that the structure was in use until the 8th century BCE, the middle of the period when the Kings of Judah ruled. 'The structure ceased to function during the 8th century BCE, possibly as part of King Hezekiah’s religious reform,' Shukron said. 'According to the Bible, Hezekiah sought to centralize worship at the Temple in Jerusalem, abolishing the ritual sites scattered across the kingdom. The Bible describes how, during the First Temple period, additional ritual sites operated outside the Temple, and two kings of Judah—Hezekiah and Josiah—implemented reforms to eliminate these sites and concentrate worship at the Temple.' 'When we began excavating the City of David in 2010, we discovered that the site had been sealed with fill from the 8th century BCE, indicating it had fallen out of use during that time,' says Shukron. 'The standing stone we uncovered remained upright in its original place, and the other rooms in the structure were also well-preserved.' Although the current excavation began in 2010, the northern part of the structure was first uncovered in 1909 by Montague Parker, a British adventurer who came to Jerusalem in search of the Ark of the Covenant and the Temple treasures. Shukron’s excavation continued over several excavation seasons. 'This unique structure uncovered in the City of David is an exciting testimony to Jerusalem's rich past,' said Amichai Eliyahu, Israel's Minister of Heritage. 'Such discoveries make our connection and historic roots – going back thousands of years – tangible, in Jerusalem and other sites where the Jewish culture and belief system emerged.'

Houthi missile targets central Israel; 11 injured running to shel...	Missile fragment damages home in Jerusalem suburb, comes after previous Houthi missile attack hours earlier. By World Israel News Staff A ballistic missile launched by the Houthis at central Israel in the early hours of Tuesday morning sent millions of Israelis scrambling for shelter, with 11 people sustaining injuries while running to protected areas. Sirens sounded in the major cities of Tel Aviv, Modi'in, and Lod, as well as the Jerusalem area and Ben-Gurion Airport, at around 3 a.m. The Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency response organization reported that 11 people throughout the country had been hurt while making their way to bomb shelters. Another four people were treated by MDA paramedics for acute anxiety. Images circulating on social media showed missile fragments that struck the roof of a home in Mevo Beitar, a Jerusalem suburb, causing damage. 'When we went out for our usual morning walk we saw broken tiles, it was only when we looked up did we see a missile on our roof,' Michal Wexler, the owner of the home, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet.. 'It’s not the smallest part [of the missile] but we did not hear anything really unusual in the night,' she added. Wexler and her family were not injured in the incident. The IDF said it had made several attempts to intercept the missile as it reached Israeli airspace. Hours earlier, on Monday evening, the Houthis launched a ballistic missile that caused sirens to sound in northern Israel's Afula area and throughout the Samaria region. No one was reported to be injured in that launch, which was intercepted by the IDF. In recent weeks, the Houthis have stepped up their attacks against Israel, lobbing dozens of explosive drones and missiles at the Jewish State. The Houthis have claimed that they will continue attacking Israel as long as the IDF is fighting Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It's unclear if a ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas terror group would end the Houthis' attacks on the Jewish State.

Will the government collapse after Hamas hostage deal?	Families of fallen soldiers and terror victims urge Smotrich, Ben-Gvir to fight against 'surrender to Hamas.' By World Israel News Staff A ceasefire and hostage deal with the Hamas terror group appears imminent, raising questions about whether the agreement may spell the end of the current Israeli government coalition. The Religious Zionism party, led by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is the head of Otzma Yehudit faction, have both expressed their opposition to the deal. Smotrich said that his party will not support the agreement, which he deemed a 'catastrophe for Israel's national security.' In a media statement, Smotrich described the truce as a 'a surrender deal that would include releasing terrorists, stopping the war and dissolving the achievements that were bought with much blood, and abandoning many hostages.' The current outline for the hostage deal would see 33 hostages - an unknown number of them alive - released in the first stage. Those hostages include all women and men over the age of 50. In exchange, thousands of Palestinian terrorists, including those serving life sentences for murdering Israelis in terror attacks, would be freed from Israeli prisons. Healthy men under the age of 50, including soldiers, would be left in Hamas captivity, pending further negotiations for the next stage of the deal. 'The emerging deal is a security and moral bankruptcy. It is a complete surrender to Hamas, which will lead to the strengthening of terrorism and endanger the security of Israeli civilians. A government that approves such a deal is unworthy of continuing to rule,' the families of fallen soldiers and victims of terror attacks wrote to Smotrich and Ben-Gvir in an open letter. The families, who are part of the Choosing Life advocacy group, demanded that the lawmakers vote against the deal and threaten to bring down the government if it moves forward. 'This is a moment of truth – you must lead this fight, even if it means leaving the government,' the families wrote. 'This is a moral, ethical, and national call – we must not surrender to terrorism. The responsibility is on you.' According to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Walla, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met with both Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, in the hopes of persuading them to vote against the agreement while remaining in the coalition.

‘On the brink’ – Biden touts impending Gaza deal, pushes Palestin...	President Biden makes his final foreign policy address a week before leaving office, calling for Palestinian self-determination, the reconstruction of Gaza, and the return of Israeli hostages. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden on Monday urged negotiators in Doha, Qatar to complete hostage deal and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, expressing optimism a final agreement can be reached in the near future. Speaking at a State Department event Monday evening, Biden gave his final foreign policy address before leaving office next week, highlighting the Arab-Israeli conflict and the weakening of the Iranian government over the past year. Ceasefire talks, Biden said, now appear to be 'finally coming to fruition,' with negotiators 'on the brink' of a permanent Gaza truce which would secure the release of the 98 Israeli hostages still held in the Gaza Strip. 'The deal we've structured would free the hostages, halt the fighting, provide security to Israel and allow us to significantly surge humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians who have suffered terribly in this war that Hamas started,' Biden said. 'I have learned in many years in public service to never, never, never, ever give up,' Biden continued. 'I spoke to the Prime Minister of Israel yesterday. I spoke to the Emir of Qatar today. I look forward to speaking with President Sisi soon. We're pressing hard to close this.' Biden reiterated his support for Palestinian statehood, saying Palestinian Arabs deserve 'the right to determine their own future,' without explicitly mentioning the establishment of a Palestinian state. 'The Palestinian people deserve peace and the right to determine their own futures, Israel deserves peace and real security. And the hostages and their families deserve to be reunited. And so we're working urgently to close this deal.' The president lamented the impact of the ongoing war on Gaza's population, calling for the area's reconstruction and rehabilitation after a truce is reached. Gazans have 'been through hell,' Biden said, 'so many innocent people have been killed, so many communities have been destroyed.' Turning to Iran, Biden highlighted the pro-U.S. coalition which helped Israel repel two large-scale attacks by Iran, and said that 15 months after the October 7th invasion and proxy warfare against Israel via Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, Iran is its weakest point in decades. 'Did you ever think we’d be where we are with Iran?' Biden asked. 'Twice they failed because the United States organized a coalition of countries to stop them and I ordered US aircraft to come to the defense of Israel.' 'All told, Iran is weaker than it has been in decades.'

Anti-Israel NGO demands arrest of Israeli general in Rome	The Hind Rajab Foundation asks Italian authorities to arrest IDF general, who heads unit that facilitates the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff An anti-Israel organization targeted an Israeli general traveling in Italy on Monday, demanding that local police arrest him on war crimes charges. The Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) is a pro-Hamas, anti-Israel advocacy group dedicated to stalking members of the Israeli military and requesting that local authorities to detain them when they travel abroad. The HRF attempted to orchestrate the arrest of IDF Major General Ghassan Alian, who was in Rome for a meeting. Alian, a Druze-Israeli, is the head of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which helps facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid and infrastructural support to Gaza and PA-controlled areas in Judea and Samaria. 'We have filed a case against him in the International Criminal Court asking them to activate any arrest warrant that they have against him, or if not issue a new one, and we have also informed the Italian authorities,' HRF chairman Dyab Abou Jahjah told the far-left YouTube channel Democracy Now. Notably, Abou Jahjah is a former member of Hezbollah who admitted to receiving 'some military training' from the terror organization. In a post on their X account, HRF accused Alian of being complicit in 'genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.' Alian 'supervised and enforced a total siege on Gaza, cutting off essential resources such as food, water, electricity, and medical supplies,' the HRF claimed, without providing evidence to support that allegation. In an October 2023 speech, Alian referred to Hamas' acts of brutality during the October 7th terror onslaught - including rape, beheadings, and the murder of children and the elderly - as being 'inhuman.' In the same speech, Alian called the Hamas perpetrators who carried out the attack 'human animals.' Those statements, HRF claim, prove that Alian has 'genocidal intent' towards Gazans.

‘A lot of trouble’ if no hostage deal reached, Trump warns	A week before his inauguration, President-elect Donald Trump speaks out on apparent breakthrough in hostage deal talks, says an agreement 'must get done,' warning of 'trouble like they have never seen before' if negotiations fail. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump warned of unprecedented repercussions should negotiators in Doha, Qatar fail to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Speaking with Newsmax on Monday night a week before his inauguration, the former president and president-elect confirmed reports from earlier in the day which claimed the Doha talks were closer than ever to achieving a deal. 'We're very close to getting it done - and they have to get it done,' Trump said. Echoing his previous warnings regarding the failure to free the remaining 98 hostages, the incoming president hinted at 'trouble' if the two sides do not achieve an agreement. 'If they don't get it done, there's going to be a lot of trouble out there - a lot of trouble like they have never seen before,' Trump warned. But the president-elect also expressed optimism at the prospects of an agreement being inked in the near future, saying that there had been a 'handshake' between the two sides. 'They will get it done. I understand there’s been a handshake and they’re getting it finished and maybe by the end of the week. But it has to take place.' Multiple Israeli media outlets, along with Reuters and The Associated Press, reported Monday that a breakthrough had been achieved in the talks, and that the Qatari mediators had penned a final draft of a potential agreement. The draft, officials cited by the reports said, has been sent to Israeli leaders and the Hamas politburo for final approval, with Hamas' leadership reportedly the deciding factor. According to Israeli reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pressuring Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and his Religious Zionist Party not to bolt the government should a deal be reached. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir is expected to resign, taking his Otzma Yehudit out of the government if the deal now under consideration is ratified, leaving the government with a slim majority of 62 seats.

Danon urges UNSC not to repeat mistakes in previous Lebanon cease...	Danon demanded that the UNSC ensure that UNIFIL 'work in a much more robust and effective way to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and the recent ceasefire understandings.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, wrote a letter to the UN Security Council urging them not to repeat past mistakes by allowing Hezbollah to violate the ceasefire agreement. Danon called on the UNSC to monitor The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which previously failed to enforce the ceasefire in Lebanon and permitted Hezbollah to commit multiple violations. Danon wrote, 'Israel alerted this esteemed Council for years on the severe breaches of Resolution 1701 and the ensuing risks posed to regional security' long before October 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing missiles into Israel. He continued, 'Israel has sounded the alarm bells in consistent letters and briefings, alerting that Hezbollah is building a massive military infrastructure south of the Litani River and beyond, that advanced weapon systems are being smuggled from Iran into Lebanon in flagrant breach of UNSCR 1701, but unfortunately no action was taken.' Danon pointed out that the consequence of ignoring Israel's warnings was that Hezbollah that '22,000 rockets, over 1,500 anti-tank missiles and over 700 drones were fired by Hezbollah at Israeli communities throughout the war, forcing over 63,000 Israeli civilians to evacuate their homes for more than a year, up till today.' Danon demanded that the UNSC ensure that UNIFIL 'work in a much more robust and effective way to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and the recent ceasefire understandings…and to insist that all terrorist infrastructure present in Lebanon is removed and to make sure any attempt to smuggle arms to Hezbollah is thwarted.' He concluded, 'Israel will not compromise on the security of its citizens. We will not return to the years before October 8, 2023, and we will not tolerate Hezbollah's violations of the ceasefire agreement.'

Nukhba terrorists will not be released as part of hostage deal	The source reported that none of the 33 hostages selected for release in the first phase are confirmed dead. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A diplomatic source told The Jerusalem Post. that Nukhba terrorists who took part in the October 7th massacre will not be released in exchange for hostages. Although some of Palestinian prisoners slated for release in the hostage deal are serving life sentences for serious crimes, they are not part of the Nukhba terrorist forces. The diplomatic source also confirmed that none of the 33 hostages selected for release in the first phase of the deal are confirmed dead. Israel is expected to remain in 'territorial assets' including the Philadelphi corridor and a security perimeter. However, there are conflicting reports regarding how long the IDF will remain in these areas. Israel's senior delegation in Doha, including Shin Bet head Ronen Bar and Mossad Director David Barnea are currently in Qatar until an agreement is reached. An agreement to release 33 hostages in the initial phase has reportedly been approved by Israel and Hamas and may be announced Monday night or Tuesday morning. Sources have reported that after the initial release of captives, further releases would be discussed on the 16th day of the agreement. There are mixed accounts of the timing of the IDF withdrawal from Gaza with some sources saying that troops would be gradually reduced with the military remaining in the Philadelphi corridor until the last day of the agreement Some sources indicate the first phase of the agreement will last 42 days. There is some indication the agreement could be announced within hours, days or it could fall apart. A cabinet vote and a High Court of Justice ruling on petitions opposing the deal will also be required. If the deal is approved, some sources say the first group of hostages will be released promptly after the announcement. Although the list of hostages to be released in phase one originally included 34 names, the number now is 33 after the discovery of the body of Yousef Ziadne by the IDF.

JFLA usually requires applicants to have a qualified guarantor but is waving that necessity for those affected by the wildfires and offering them a fire relief loan of up to $2,000 for people of all faiths and backgrounds. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The Jewish Free Loan Association (JFLA) is offering families and individuals affected by the Los Angeles wildfires, regardless of their race or religion, zero-interest and zero-fee loans up to $15,000. The loans can cover temporary housing, including short-term rentals and hotels, clothing, medication, the purchase of a used car, and other needs and supplies. JFLA is also offering assistance to small businesses and nonprofits by helping with the purchase of inventory, relocation costs, marketing, and the replacement of equipment. Small business and nonprofit loans are available for up to $36,000. The nonprofit organization offers zero-interest, zero-fee personal and business loans with no collateral. JFLA usually requires applicants to have a qualified guarantor but is waving that necessity for those affected by the wildfires and offering them a fire relief loan of up to $2,000 for people of all faiths and backgrounds. The organization has a limited number of loans up to $2,000 without guarantors that are available on a first-come, first serve basis. The organization has been helping the Los Angeles community since it was founded in 1904, assisting thousands of families who immigrated to the US during World War II and supporting hundreds of Iranian Jewish refugee immigrants who relocated to the US in the late 1970s and 1980s after the Iranian revolution. It is the only interest-free lending agency in the greater Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties, and has provided $18 million of interest-free loan dollars throughout the region. Wildfires have been burning throughout the Los Angeles area since Jan. 7 and at least 24 people have died. Officials said at least 12,300 structures have been damaged or destroyed, and more 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes since Sunday, according to Reuters. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the wildfires could be the most catastrophic natural disaster in US history.

Don’t be fooled by the Palestinian Authority, observers warn	Despite its current operations against terrorism in Judea and Samaria, their real reasons are not as honorable as one might think. By Israel Kasnett, JNS A casual observer might look at the Palestinian Authority today and believe it has reformed by cracking down on terror groups that seek to attack Israel, but experts who spoke with JNS warned against being taken in by appearances. 'Everything the P.A. is doing right now is part of the Trump effect. The P.A. remembers [President-elect Donald] Trump’s steps against them in the previous term and wants to show that they are capable of change,' said Shaul Bartal of the Begin Sadat Center for Strategic Research at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan. 'In practice, this is a big show,' he added. 'To the extent that there is change, it needs to be tested in action, and right now it is not visible,' Bartal said. Even the Palestinians don’t believe the P.A. has changed, he added. 'The majority of the Palestinian public in the West Bank is not satisfied with the P.A. and there is almost no Palestinian factor that believes that this is a real change within the P.A.' The race to succeed Abbas Case in point: Jibril Rajoub, secretary-general of the Fatah Central Committee, called for continued terrorism in an interview on the official P.A. TV channel earlier this month. During the interview, as reported by the Israeli NGO Regavim, Rajoub called on Palestinian armed factions to coordinate their efforts with Fatah and not to undermine the P.A. 'From the first moment, what we need is a meeting of factions to affirm the conformity of the Authority, the conformity and legitimacy of weapons, and also the legitimacy of the resistance,' he said. Rajoub, the former head of the P.A.’s preventive security forces and current president of the Palestinian Football Association, directly encouraged terrorism, adding, 'The battle in the 1967 occupied lands is open in all means … but not at the expense of the Palestinian Authority.' In response, Israel’s Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar called on FIFA to dismiss Rajoub, citing his support for the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre and incitement to terrorism. According to Bartal, at the moment the entire P.A. is engaged in a 'succession battle' over who will replace P.A. chief Mahmoud Abbas, 89. He noted that in the ’90s, Rajoub 'was one of the factors who helped Israel the most to suppress Hamas.' According to Bartal, 'Hassan Salama from Khan Yunis, [the late Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar’s good friend who was responsible for the revenge attacks in 1996 after the death of [Hamas bomb mastermind] Yahya Ayyash, explicitly writes in his book that Rajoub handed him over to Israeli intelligence.' For this reason, in Bartal’s view Rajoub’s statements 'are intended for a Palestinian audience that remembers the Oslo period in his role as head of Preventive Security in the West Bank.' Amid the war against Hamas in Gaza, Palestinian public opinion strongly supports terrorist activity against Israel, according to Bartal. In light of this, Rajoub seems to believe that the way to stand out from his current role as the P.A.’s Sports Minister 'is only if he highlights a stubborn stance and support for the Palestinian armed resistance,' he said. The other candidates to replace Abbas are Mahmoud al-Aloul, vice chairman of Fatah, who also expresses tough positions against Israel, although he is less well-known to the general public; Majed Faraj, the head of the Palestinian General Intelligence Service, and several others. 'Unfortunately, in Palestinian society, the way to achieve recognition and a very important status is through extremist statements and support for terrorist attacks,' said Bartal. The P.A. is losing control There is another reason the P.A. appears to be taking action against armed groups in the areas it controls. Bartal told JNS that in northern Samaria and especially in the Jenin area, 'the P.A. has begun to lose control.' It 'wants to show Israel, and especially Trump, that it is capable of enforcing government order and dealing with militants,' he explained. 'If it succeeds in the operation that has been going on for over a month, it will first of all prove its relevance in Judea and Samaria, also in Israeli eyes, and secondly, its ability to impose future order in the Gaza Strip and perhaps deal with militants from Hamas there,' he said. Yet there is still more to the story. 'Outlaws' vs 'legitimate resistance' Khaled Abu Toameh, an award winning Arab and Palestinian Affairs journalist and a Senior Distinguished Fellow at the Gatestone Institute and a Fellow of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, told JNS that the P.A. is more worried about its honor than it is about actually fighting terror groups. 'This is not a strategic decision by Abbas or the Palestinian leadership to dismantle all the Iran-backed battalion groups. This is just something specific that is taking place,' he told JNS. 'We’ve seen clashes like this in the past,' he noted, adding that this time it appears to be on a larger scale since the armed groups have 'never before challenged the P.A. in such a way.' He warned against misinterpreting what the P.A. is doing and why. First, Abu Toameh said, 'They could be presenting it as ‘Yes, we are combating terrorism.’' But if so, 'where were you all these years?' he said. Second, Abu Toameh asked, 'Why can’t the P.A. say openly in Arabic, ‘No more battalions, no more armed groups and no such thing as resistance’? Why don’t we hear that message? I don’t hear it in Arabic.' Instead, Abu Toameh said he hears Palestinian officials saying that while some armed men '‘are outlaws,’ they also say ‘we are not against the weapons of the resistance.’' According to Abu Toameh, the P.A. presents these outlaws as contrasting against the armed groups that engage in the real resistance against Israel. For the P.A., the weapons of 'the resistance' are honorable, he said. 'They don’t come out against the whole idea of resistance against Israel.' Furthermore, he added, 'We know there is no strategic decision to dismantle these groups because we don’t see it in other places like Tulkarem and Nablus.' With Trump’s inauguration just days away, the timing for the P.A. is perfect, according to Abu Toameh. 'If you hear the messaging of the P.A. in English and Arabic, it is different,' he said. 'In English they are saying the right things.' Unfortunately, foreign diplomats keep falling for it, he added. 'But in Arabic, the P.A. says, ‘We are not against the resistance. We understand the weapons of the resistance are honorable weapons.'' The P.A. uses the term 'sharif,' he explained, 'which in Arabic means ‘honorable.’' 'We have seen this in the past when the Palestinians put on a show. They are very good at manipulation,' he said.

Outrage grows as Israel’s living costs soar 38% above developed n...	Electricity costs are also surging 3.5%, while water rates rise 2%, and property taxes ostensibly charged to the renter are climbing too. By Jewish Breaking News Israeli bureaucrats faced harsh criticism Monday during a contentious State Control Committee hearing that exposed the government’s struggle to address skyrocketing living costs. The National Economic Council presented a sobering assessment revealing that prices in Israel are a whopping 38% higher than in other developed nations, with some sectors reaching an eye-watering 52% premium. While Council Chair Prof. Avi Simhon acknowledged the 'reality is not good,' his defense leaned heavily on excuses such as 'government policy' and 'very high taxation.' Bank of Israel representative Dr. Sigal Ribon argued inflation would have normalized if not for the war. Although Israel’s inflation has dropped from its 5.4% peak to 3.4% in recent months, the government’s new tax measures for 2025 could reverse this progress and keep interest rates high. Value-added tax (VAT) has been increased from 17% to 18%, which even Ministry of Finance official Uriel Shem Tov admitted nobody wanted but claimed was necessary due to war costs. 'Professionally speaking, the Ministry of Finance does not support raising income tax. I can’t say that raising VAT is a good measure, but that was the alternative that was chosen,' he said. 'We raised the tax on one-person companies and holding companies in such a way that the company owners will feel it. This represents revenue of about NIS 10 million for the state treasury in 2025.' Electricity costs are also surging 3.5%, while water rates rise 2%, and property taxes ostensibly charged to the renter are climbing too. Most cities are hiking rates by 5.2%, with Jerusalem going even further by targeting newer buildings constructed since 2020 with additional increases. 'The tax hikes will create a social wall that will prevent all disadvantaged populations from overcoming the crisis. The entire economic approach needs to be changed,' Latet Director Gilles Darmon said. After hours of bureaucratic back-and-forth, the committee’s solution followed a familiar pattern Israelis are too used to seeing: form another task force, commission more studies, and reconvene in six months. With over 1 million children living in poverty, that timeline offers little hope as they go to bed hungry tonight.

Quiet revolution: Petah Tikva deploys noise sensors in public par...	Noise-capturing cameras were set up one and a half years ago to identify and fine 'drivers who honk for no apparent reason.' By Pesach Benson, TPS To combat noise pollution, Petah Tikva became the first Israeli municipality to begin installing sound sensors in parks on Monday as part of a pilot project to collect data and provide real-time alerts for excessive noise. 'As part of the municipality’s activities to maintain order in the public space and prevent noise pollution, this year the innovative system for enforcing noise on the road began operating in Petah Tikva – for the first time in the country,' said Petah Tikva Mayor Rami Greenberg. The first sensors were placed in the city’s Neve Gan Park. More than 250,000 people live in Petah Tikva, east of Tel Aviv. Dganit Tal, head of the municipality’s environment department, explained to The Press Service of Israel that the initiative builds on a pilot project to reduce excessive honking by motorists. 'We have several major roads inside the city, with traffic at any time of the day, with multi-story residential buildings on both sides. It is hard for the residents to have this amount of noise coming from the windows,' Tal told TPS-IL. Noise-capturing cameras were set up one and a half years ago to identify and fine 'drivers who honk for no apparent reason.' Tal told TPS-IL, 'Since the start of the project, some 1,400 drivers have been penalized. We don’t do this to get some extra money to the city budget, we want to educate the people, and we see it works.' According to Tal, the number of tickets issued has dropped by 40 percent since the traffic pilot’s launch. She explained that the sensors installed in the Neve Gan Park will send info to the municipal center. 'Once the system identifies large gatherings, especially of young people, a city patrol will be able to arrive at the place and warn against making too much noise even before this happens,' Tal said. Noise pollution refers to excessive or disruptive sounds that negatively impact the health, well-being, or comfort of humans and wildlife. It is typically caused by human activities, such as traffic, industrial operations, construction, loud music, and machinery. Prolonged exposure to noises 70 decibels or louder — such as a vacuum cleaner at close range — can harm hearing or health. Noise pollution has been associated with hearing loss, stress, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular issues, and reduced productivity. For wildlife, researchers have found it can disrupt communication, navigation and even breeding.

Five IDF soldiers slain in Gaza, bringing IDF wartime toll to 840	On Sunday, four IDF soldiers were killed, and six others were wounded when they were likewise struck by an explosive in the Beit Hanoun area. By JNS Five members of the Israel Defense Forces’ Nahal Brigade were killed in action fighting Hamas terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip, the military announced on Monday night. The troops killed on Monday were identified by the IDF as Capt. Yair Yaakov Shushani, 23, from Ma’alot-Tarshiha; 1st Sgt. Yahav Hadar, 20, from Kfar Tavor; 1st Sgt. Guy Karmiel, 20, from Gedera; 1st Sgt. Yoav Feffer, 19, from Herzliya; and 1st Sgt. Aviel Wiseman, 20, from Poria Illit. All five served in Sayeret Nahal, the special forces unit of the brigade. Eight more Nahal soldiers were seriously wounded in the incident. According to Israel’s Ynet news outlet, they were killed when terrorists activated explosives in a structure in northern Gaza’s Beit Hanoun. On Sunday, four IDF soldiers were killed and six others were wounded when they were likewise struck by an explosive in the Beit Hanoun area. The death toll among troops since the start of the ground incursion in Gaza on Oct. 27, 2023, now stands at 408, and at 840 on all fronts since the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Additionally, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Israel Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage-rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded there in May.

Netanyahu faces opposition within Likud over hostage deal	10 coalition lawmakers, including 7 Likud MKs, sign onto petition rejecting the current hostage deal and ceasefire proposal under consideration, following news of breakthrough in talks. By World Israel News Staff A number of coalition lawmakers came out Monday against the proposed hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire currently under consideration in Doha, Qatar, highlighting the challenges Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could face in securing backing for a agreement with Hamas. On Monday, two groups jointly penned a letter to Netanyahu expressing their opposition to the deal currently on the table, and urged him to reject any proposal which requires Israel surrender control over strategic areas in the Gaza Strip, including the Philadephi Corridor separating Gaza from Egypt. 'The alarming reports about a potential agreement with Hamas during these critical times raise severe concerns for Israel's security,' the letter reads. 'Amidst overwhelming internal and external pressures, we reiterate that under no circumstances should three moral red lines be crossed in any agreement with the murderous terrorist organization Hamas.' 'We cannot rely on others when it comes to Israel's security. No one can replace IDF soldiers—whether at the Rafah Crossing, the Netzarim Corridor, or anywhere else.' The letter also demanded that any hostage release be conducted in a single step, rather than over multiple phases, and warned against allowing the return en masse of Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip. 'There must be no return of the enemy to the northern Gaza Strip.' 'This area is filled with weapons stockpiles and rockets and poses a direct threat to the residents of Sderot and the surrounding areas. Allowing mass return to this region will inevitably lead to renewed rocket fire against our citizens.' 'Such a step would squander the significant achievements of the war and render the sacrifices of those who fell in battle meaningless. It is an immoral move that will demand the lives of hundreds more soldiers to clear the area of the neo-Nazi enemy we are facing.' The letter was penned by two right-leaning groups including the Tikva Forum, one of two organizations lobbying on behalf of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, and the Gvura Forum, representing the families of soldiers killed on October 7th or during the ensuing war. Ten Knesset Members from the Coalition signed on to the letter, including seven members of Netanyahu's own Likud party: MKs Amit Halevi, Hanoch Milwidsky, Moshe Sa'ada, Tsega Melaku, Moshe Passal, Avichai Boaron, and Dan Iluz. Two MKs from Otzma Yehudit - Limor Son Har-Melech and Yitzhak Kroizer - also signed the letter, along with MK Simcha Rothman from the Religious Zionist Party. Earlier on Monday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, chairman of the Religious Zionist Party, signaled that his faction would oppose the current hostage deal proposal, calling it a 'catastrophe' for Israeli national security.

Hamas confirms breakthrough in hostage talks	Freedom is near' for our prisoners, Hamas says, amid reports of impending hostage deal and ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization on Monday confirmed reports of a major breakthrough in hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar, and claims of an impending ceasefire deal with Israel. Overnight, President-elect Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff conducted multiple rounds of talks with officials in Doha, including members of the Israeli delegation and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Reuters reported. Following the talks, Arab mediators reportedly issued a final draft of a proposed ceasefire and hostage deal to the Israeli and Hamas teams, after brokering agreements on the hostage releases, the pacing of the three-phase ceasefire, the dimensions of an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the approximate number of jailed Palestinian terrorists to be released. Multiple outlets, including the Associated Press, Jerusalem Post, Israel's Channel 12 and Channel 13 all reported that mediators were waiting on Hamas to respond to the latest draft of the proposed agreement. In a statement released Monday afternoon, Hamas confirmed that progress had been made overnight towards a deal, and appeared to signal its approval of the deal, without overtly accepting it. 'We renew our pledge with our steadfast and patient people and with our heroic prisoners in the prisons, and we affirm that their freedom is near,' Hamas said. Under the proposed agreement, Hamas will free 33-34 Israeli hostages during the first phase of a ceasefire, which is set to last for 45 days. During this period, Israel will release approximately 1,100-1,200 jailed Palestinian terrorists, including 150-200 serving life sentences and 48 who were previously jailed, freed during the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal, and then rearrested for additional offenses. In addition, during the first phase of the ceasefire, some 90 female terrorists would be released, along with 350 jailed terrorists under the age of 19, and 560 elderly or ill terrorists.

‘Catastrophe’ – Senior Israeli minister blasts emerging deal with...	Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich says his party will oppose proposed hostage deal plan, amid reports of breakthrough in talks in Qatar. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior Israeli government minister castigated the emerging hostage deal in Qatar, threatening to oppose ratification of the agreement if it is brought to a vote. On Monday, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, chairman of the Religious Zionist Party, took to X/Twitter to condemn the latest ceasefire proposal now under consideration in talks in Doha, Qatar. Smotrich lambasted the deal, which would be implemented over three phases, as a 'catastrophe' for Israel's security. 'The emerging deal is a catastrophe for the national security of the State of Israel,' Smotrich wrote. 'We will not be part of a surrender deal that would include releasing arch-terrorists, ending the war, and erasing the achievements that cost us so much.' Smotrich also claimed the proposed agreement would 'abandon many hostages,' a reference to the plans to release just 34 of the remaining 98 Israeli hostages during the first phase of a potential ceasefire, leaving the fate of the remaining hostages uncertain, and linked to Hamas' compliance with the truce. 'This is the time to continue with all our might, to occupy and cleanse the entire [Gaza] Strip, to finally take control of humanitarian aid from Hamas, and to open the gates of hell on Gaza until Hamas surrenders completely and all the hostages are returned.' According to multiple Hebrew reports this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sought to win Smotrich's support - or at the very least his acquiescence - for a deal with Hamas, reportedly warning Smotrich that outright opposition to a deal would risk the ire of the incoming Trump administration and lessen the likelihood the new president would support Israeli plans to apply sovereignty in Judea and Samaria. An Israeli official told Walla Sunday that Netanyahu fears National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) will bolt the coalition if the deal currently under consideration is ratified. Netanyahu, according to the official, has made overtures to Smotrich to gauge his willingness to at least remain in the government in such a scenario, even if Smotrich and the Religious Zionist Party vote against the ceasefire deal.

Behind the screens: When AI trains Israel’s top guns	Simulators used to train Israeli Air Force pilots prepare them for long-range missions, stealth reconnaissance, and providing air support to ground troops. By Adi Rubinstein, JNS Entering the Israeli Air Force’s Hatzor Base, near Ashdod, one might think nothing has changed in recent years. But as you proceed into the heart of the facility, it becomes clear that what was will never be the same again. The base is busier than ever, and encounters with younger and older airmen alike testify that we are in the midst of war. This young generation has been busy protecting the homeland for 15 months now. A decade ago, this writer was here for an Independence Day story, trying out the simulator that pilots use to maintain operational readiness in case they need to respond quickly. Since then, our world has been turned upside down, and suddenly, alongside training and long hours in the simulator, it seems our pilots are logging the same hours in the real thing, in the skies of the Middle East. Along with the change in spirit, the base will soon see a material change as well. A facility being built these days will allow for more simulator work and diversify pilots’ training, enabling them to work in larger formations and accommodate more aircrew members. Its construction will be completed in the coming years, and the new generation will be using this simulator, further widening the gap between the blue and white Air Force and air forces across much of the Western world, certainly in the Middle East. An F-15 simulator At the entrance to the MTC (Mission Training Center), its commander, Maj. T., awaits us. A kippah on his head, a smile on his face, and above all, much patience for a reporter who is about to climb into an F-15 simulator for the second time in his life and, as usual, embarrass himself. Israeli Air Force commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar attends the 'Spark' UAV inauguration ceremony at Hatzor Airbase, Sept. 10, 2023. Credit: IDF. From T.’s words, who participated in the strike on Iran, one can understand that with each such strike, pilots improve in the simulator as well, as it allows them to better understand the topography of each location, including places where no one imagined we would be (Sanaa in Yemen, for example). This is exactly the discussion that will accompany us during our visit to the Mission Training Center: How much can the simulator, especially in the AI era, simulate that real feeling of war. 'Look, there are many advantages to the simulator, and over the years it really keeps improving,' T. explains. 'I’ll clarify—in fact, in the simulator you can reach extreme situations that the chance of them happening in real training or combat is very small, but you can turn the simulator into one that constantly puts you in these extreme situations. Indeed, it happened more than once in the past year that soldiers returned from distant and near operations and the first thing they said was, ‘Wow, it’s just like in the simulator,’ or alternatively presented us with things related to improving the simulator.' Squadron commander Lt. Col. A., who participated in a strike on Yemen, joins the conversation as we begin walking toward the simulator: 'Besides the clear advantages of training, beyond what the simulator can provide 24 hours a day, first we must remember the financial costs as well. In the end, there’s savings of hundreds of millions for the army of course, especially in the period we’re in now. You can’t train at any moment and in any situation, but in the simulator it’s possible.' ‘Oct. 7 wasn’t in the simulator’ I ask A. how much the simulator really simulates what’s been happening here in the past year. 'First of all, true, October 7 was something that didn’t appear in any simulator,' he says. 'I think all of us, like the entire army, understood and learned from what happened there, and since then the situation has completely changed, and from what happened there we’re all trying to learn. 'Another thing, physiologically the simulator can’t simulate of course the feeling of encountering g-force—that’s something you can only experience when you’re in the air. Perhaps in the future these are the dramatic changes that will be in the simulator, in my opinion, if they manage to incorporate them, that physical experience.' When I get on the simulator, the commanders won’t let me 'fly' in other countries’ territory, and I have to take off from Israel and stay within the country’s boundaries. They’ll make sure foreign aircraft 'infiltrate here' and attack me, although after what happened here in the past year, what enemy aircraft can still attack me? In the simulator there are no Gazans on donkeys wearing flip-flops, but still I’m 'attacked by foreign forces,' and as usual finish the simulator at a level that A. defines as 'barely flight school material.' I don’t know, I feel I was excellent, especially in the turns I took and the exercises I did, but T. explains that I took a turn like a 'transport plane and not a fighter jet.' I explain to him that like parking in Tel Aviv, I entered carefully so as not to hit the cars in front and behind. They almost laugh. Fortunately, I finish the essay without vertigo, and I also manage to drop fragments over the sea and not hit civilian population. You can continue sleeping peacefully, there are those who are watching over you. Another thing that isn’t in the simulator, or at least wasn’t shown to me, is the drone threat. The different sizes, different confrontations that the Air Force faces since Hezbollah and the Houthis entered the fight, force the entire security system to respond quickly. 'We know how to bring the data to Elbit [Haifa-based Elbit Systems Ltd., the primary provider of the military’s land-based equipment and unmanned aerial vehicles], and during the war we learned how quickly they know how to write code that will deal with the threat of drones in different sizes,' explains T. 'This allows the entire system, including the simulator, to deal with things differently and more efficiently, and of course together with the data that pilots bring from the field we know how to improve during the war.' The aftermath of an Israeli strike on Houthi targets in Yemen. Source: Arab social media. Following progress With AI entering our world, the question arises where this field is going regarding the battlefield, especially when we’re talking about simulators. When we meet female soldiers who can recite by heart the entire structure of the aircraft and its capabilities, we ask where this knowledge will go as technology develops: 'That’s the question,' says T., 'I assume we don’t know how to answer that yet.' A. argues that 'there is and will be no substitute for human experience, with all due respect to the simulator, when you’re in the sky physically, bodily, mentally—everything looks different. 'True, the simulator prepares you for extreme situations, and then even in mentally difficult situations when you’re in the air you know how to react calmly, because you trained in the simulator, but there are still events that occur in the battlefield and the simulator doesn’t simulate them, for example if God forbid you need to make a decision related to ejecting from the aircraft, in the end in the simulator it’s not like the real thing, because when you’re there alone the decisions made are different.' U.S. and U.K. forces struck Yemen’s Houthis on Jan. 22, 2024. Source: Social media. I don’t know whether this public relations tour was meant to strengthen the confidence we all have in the excellent people who shake our houses every evening ('Really sorry, we’re rushing to the target,' A. laughs at me), or to restore our lost faith in everything related to the state and army in the past year. Either way, cynicism aside, at Hatzor you meet the best men and women Israel has to offer.

How anti-Israeli activists are pushing denial of Hamas rapes on O...	Former prosecutor says they are distorting her statements that indictments are hard to file when so many of those raped were murdered and survivors are too traumatized to testify. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Anti-Israel activists around the world have renewed propaganda efforts denying that Hamas terrorists raped Israelis during their surprise invasion of southern Israel last October 7th, by distorting recent statements of a former prosecutor who investigated many of the cases, Ynet reported Monday. Moran Gez, one of the original four prosecutors assigned to analyze evidence of the massive number of heinous acts committed by the thousands of terrorists and civilians who crossed the border from Gaza, had told Yedioth Ahronoth Friday, 'Unfortunately, it will be very difficult to prove these crimes,' because of the simple fact that 'we don’t have complainants.' Either the victims were murdered, she noted, or rape survivors are not willing to attest to what happened to them. 'In this area, I would temper expectations. I know the public is expecting action and understands the need to address the horrific sexual offenses and assaults that occurred, but the vast majority of these cases won’t meet the evidentiary threshold in court, and the criticism will ultimately fall on the prosecution—unjustly so,' Gez said. Palestinian apologists soon began twisting her words on social media to mean that the rape accusations were false. The Middle East Monitor, a London-based anti-Israel outlet, said outright that 'Gaz' had 'stated that her department has found no evidence of sexual violence.' It also claimed a 'March 2023' report by the UN – seven months before the war – 'debunked similar allegations' whereas in reality the body’s Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, had actually officially verified in March 2024 that Hamas fighters had committed mass rapes during the invasion. A different journalist, one with hundreds of thousands of followers, also used the fact that no indictments had been filed to post that this was 'proof' that the crimes did not occur. Gez was astounded by the lies. 'I am amazed,' she said. 'The fact that there were no complaints was due to two reasons - the Hamas terrorists who raped the young Israeli women murdered them, even during the rape. [And] due to the trauma, women who were raped by members of the terrorist organization and Gaza residents who infiltrated Israel did not muster the courage to file a complaint.' 'Any other interpretation of my words is nothing more than cheap propaganda and ignores the fact that the Hamas terrorists committed war crimes,' she continued. 'In my opinion, the only punishment for them is death.' Gez did admit that the legal proceedings were moving along too slowly, for two main reasons. Linking a specific person to a specific act is required for a normal kind of trial, but when there are dozens of crime scenes, hundreds of suspects and thousands of crimes committed, she said, this becomes almost impossible. 'Standard rules of evidence don’t fit this situation,' she explained, and therefore 'What’s needed is a comprehensive legislative reform' so that 'Israeli law is adapted to the atrocities that occurred that day' and indictments can be filed. She didn’t know if such a reform process was even underway 15 months after the mass attack, but she did know that there are far too few prosecutors, perhaps twenty in all, examining the mountains of evidence already provided by first responders, the police, and forensic pathologists, among others. The best solution is a confession, she noted, but 'surprisingly, in the interrogations of these terrorists, they try to downplay the nationalist aspect,' she said. 'From my experience with security cases, most terrorists are very proud of what they’ve done and don’t hide it&#8230;. Yet, in practice, most of the terrorists from October 7 turned out to be cowards' and are not admitting what they had done.

‘Dramatic’ breakthrough in hostage deal talks as Qatar waits on H...	Israel and Hamas on verge of signing a long-awaited hostage deal and ceasefire agreement, multiple reports claim, with mediators waiting on terror group's response to final draft of proposed agreement. By World Israel News Staff Hostage deal talks underway in Doha, Qatar achieved a major breakthrough overnight, according to multiple reports Monday morning. The breakthrough came sometime after midnight early Monday morning, following discussions between President-elect Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, the Israeli negotiating team, and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Reuters reported Monday, citing an official familiar with the talks. The source claimed that Qatari mediators have issued a final draft of a proposed ceasefire and hostage deal to the Israeli and Hamas delegations. Reports by several Israeli outlets claimed that the negotiations are on the verge of achieving a deal, and that the ball is now in Hamas’ court; suggesting that Israel has already signaled its agreement to the final draft. According to Israel’s Channel 12, the two sides have reach compromises on the key issues, and Qatari mediators are now waiting for formal approval by Hamas’ politburo. A source cited by The Jerusalem Post echoed this claim, stating that a deal has already been reached and that negotiators are merely waiting for Hamas to officially sign off on the agreement. 'The hostage deal outline is clear, and Israel has come a long, long way,' an Israeli official said. 'We are moving forward slowly and carefully. We hope that Hamas will stop with its refusals.' The Associated Press reported that significant progress was made overnight by the U.S. delegation and Arab brokers, but cited officials who said that no deal had yet been reached. One source cited in the AP report confirmed that a breakthrough had been made, but that both the Israeli and Hamas delegations would need to relay the latest draft to their respective leaders for consideration. An Israeli official who spoke with Channel 13 expressed optimism that a deal could be reached in a matter of days. 'If Hamas responds soon, all the details can be finalized with days.'

Nahariya grandmother dies of injuries from previous Hezbollah roc...	Edri’s apartment was hit by a terrorist rocket fired from Lebanon around 11:30 p.m. on Nov. 26, mere hours before the ceasefire deal between the IDF and Hezbollah began. By JNS The Nahariya Municipality announced on Sunday night that a 75-year-old resident of the northern city died of wounds sustained in a Nov. 26 Hezbollah rocket attack on her home. 'With great sorrow, we were informed tonight of the death of Tamar Edri, a resident of the city, who was critically wounded when a rocket hit her home on Jabotinsky Street, in a barrage fired at the city during the Swords of Iron war some two months ago, and had been fighting for her life in the hospital ever since,' the municipality said in a statement. Edri’s apartment was hit by a terrorist rocket fired from Lebanon around 11:30 p.m. on Nov. 26, mere hours before the ceasefire deal between the Israel Defense Forces and Iranian-backed Hezbollah went into effect. In addition to Edri, three other people were lightly wounded in the attack. Edri was a mother of four daughters and nine grandchildren, Ynet said. Nachum Rosenberg, Edri’s son-in-law, told the Israeli news outlet on Sunday evening that while she had not regained consciousness since Nov. 26, the family had expected her to recover from her wounds. 'We knew that her injury was not simple, but we expected that she would recover and we did not lose hope. Unfortunately, that did not happen,' Rosenberg told Ynet. According to data released last week by the National Public Diplomacy Directorate in the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, Hezbollah terrorists fired at least 15,400 rockets and missiles at the Jewish state in 2024. At the same time, terrorists sent at least 399 drones toward Israeli territory last year, the vast majority of which came from Lebanon. A ceasefire was signed on Nov. 26 and took effect the following day, ending hostilities nearly 14 months after Hezbollah started attacking Israel in support of Hamas the day after the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre.

Muslims raped more women in Europe than Rwanda or Yugoslavia	In European country after country, governments have covered up, dismissed, silenced, and ignored these numbers. By Daniel Greenfield, Frontpage Magazine Sweden has the highest sexual assault rates in the EU. When researchers tried to unravel the cause of the sexual assault epidemic in the country they discovered that 'first- and second-generation immigrants constituted the majority of the rape offenders'. Over half of immigrant sex offenders came from the Middle East and Africa. In Malmo, the largest ‘Muslim city’ in Sweden and Europe, where a quarter of the population is Muslim, the study found that 71% of the convicted rapists were immigrants. Swedish authorities tried to prosecute the female lead researcher for releasing those numbers. Sweden’s sexual assault numbers rose sharply after the Muslim migrant crisis, going from around 16,000 in 2015 to over 23,000 in 2023. A previous survey by Sweden’s SVT television after the migrant crisis found that 58% of convicted rapists were immigrants and that 80% of the rapists who attacked women whom they did not know were immigrants. Assuming that these numbers hold for the general population, Muslims have been responsible for some 40,000 sexual assaults in a country of only 10 million. Those are equivalent to the number of rapes that allegedly took place during the fighting in the former Yugoslavia. A EU parliamentarian noted that 'Sweden has the second-highest Muslim immigration rate and the second-highest sexual assault rate in Europe.' In one survey, over 1 in 10 Swedish women reported that they had been raped. In the UK, rapes more than doubled from over 16,000 to over 36,000 during the Muslim migrant crisis. Today they stand at over 67,000 for an increase of over 50,000 or over 300%. One in 10 women in the UK reported that they were raped. During this same period, the Muslim population rose by over 1 million. In Ireland, sexual assaults rose by 50% from 2012 to 2022. During this same time, the Muslim population in Ireland rose by 60%. The EU’s own statistics report admits that the trend in sexual assaults has 'been on the increase since 2015' across the European Union. But not all European Union countries are created equal. Western European countries have some of the highest sexual assault rates and Eastern European countries have some of the lowest rates. In Germany, 8% of women reported they had been raped while in neighboring Poland, only 3% had. Germany has millions of Muslims while Poland has tens of thousands. In 2021, Germany was forced to grapple with the fact that the migrant invaders were responsible for over 13% of sexual assaults despite making up over 2% of the population. At the peak of the migrant crisis, 1,200 women were assaulted in Cologne over New Year’s Eve. The vast majority of those arrested were Arab Muslim male migrants from North Africa. Before the migrant crisis, Germany recorded around 7,000 sexual assaults. By 2023, the numbers had risen to over 12,000. Cultural stereotypes about Europeans have little to do with the defining numbers. In ‘hot-blooded’ Greece, less than 4% of women reported being raped, but in the ‘colder’ Netherlands nearly 14% of women did. The one determining factor is Islam. The Netherlands have a 5% Muslim population while Greece holds a less than 2% Muslim population. To understand the scale of the problem, Western European nations invaded the former Yugoslavia over reports of tens of thousands of rapes, and considered that to be ethnic cleansing. In those same countries, Muslims have carried out far more rapes than that. The UK’s Pakistani Muslim grooming gang scandals alone exceed over 1,000 girls victimized in the town of Telford with a population of 153,000. In Rotherham, the estimated number has been set at 1,400 in a population of a quarter of a million. And these are only pieces of a larger crisis. The UK’s annual rapes have increased by 50,000 from before the Muslim migrant crisis. Since then there have been an excess 330,000 rapes. While it’s difficult to estimate what the numbers might have been if not for Muslim settler colonialism, the UK’s population increased by 6% since then and 60% of that growth was due to migrants. The native population has not grown in any kind of numbers that would account for even a small percentage of an increase in rapes. Indeed, the native population actually statistically shrank. A 300% increase in rapes cannot be accounted for by the native population. And that 300% adds up to hundreds of thousands of women raped in the UK in less than a decade. That’s over ten times the rapes reportedly at issue in the former Yugoslavia. They exceed even the UN’s estimates of 100,000 to 250,000 rapes in Rwanda. And that’s in the UK alone. In Germany, excess sexual assaults since the Muslim migrant crisis amounted to around 27,000. And with migrants accounting for at least 10% of overall assaults, that is over 1,000 annual sexual assaults by migrants. The New Year’s assaults in Cologne, Germany resulted in over 500 sexual assault complaints alone. Rape rates in Germany have doubled since the late 1990s and with negative native population growth that increase is most likely due to the migrant population. That would amount to tens of thousands of sexual assaults attributable due to changing demographics from the Muslim world. These case studies from only a few European countries show the severe scale of the crisis. In European country after country, governments have covered up, dismissed, silenced and ignored these numbers. Researchers, activists and journalists have faced prosecution for merely mentioning what is not simply a crime wave, but a campaign of ethnic cleansing. Muslim perpetrators have repeatedly justified their actions by asserting cultural differences. Imams and community leaders made excuses for them while claiming the stories were ‘Islamophobic' lies. The perpetrators taunted their victims in racial and religious terms similar to those that were at issue in the war crimes trials out of Yugoslavia, but instead of war crimes trials, Europe surrendered and began to appease the perpetrators and cover up their crime. After a series of rapes, Norway tried to ‘educate’ Muslim migrants about acceptable behavior toward women, but the number of assaults since then have only grown worse. The UK police responded to Muslim grooming gangs by threatening victims and their parents to fight ‘Islamophobia’. Sweden threatened to prosecute researchers exposing the scale of immigrant sexual assaults because this was considered ‘sensitive’ data that should not be published. Europe has been subjected to ethnic cleansing by Muslim migrants and their political apologists on a scale greater than Yugoslavia or Rwanda. The crime is horrific and the cover-up is even worse. When there were rapes in Yugoslavia, Europe went to war, but when there is ethnic cleansing across the UK, France, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, and Germany, there is silence.

‘The most violent day’: Palestinian Authority crackdown on Jenin ...	Casualty reports indicate at least 15 people have been killed in the now 40 days of fighting, including six members of the PA and Islamic Jihad commander in the camp, Yazid Ja’aysa. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Fighting between Palestinian Authority security forces and local terror groups in the Jenin refugee camp stretched into its fifth week. Eyewitnesses told The Press Service of Israel on Sunday of intense clashes in the Damaj neighborhood where a PA heavy vehicle was struck, forcing PA forces to fire at least one rocket propelled grenade. 'This is the most violent day,' a local resident told TPS-IL. 'The use of RPGs was last seen in the early days of the conflict.' The ongoing operation has taken a heavy toll on the camp’s infrastructure. Water, electricity, and internet lines have been cut off for most of the day in large parts of Jenin. Residents tell of children distributing bread, water, and milk between houses under curfew. 'Dozens of houses have been completely burned, deliberately set on fire by PA soldiers,' another resident told TPS-IL. Palestinian officials in Jenin confirmed that PA forces faced heavy resistance from Palestinian Islamic Jihad gunmen, leading some personnel to retreat. 'This is without a doubt the peak in the battles since they broke out,' a Palestinian official told TPS-IL. 'The Palestinian Authority forces fired RPGs, burned houses, and even Qurans, after repeatedly laying siege to alleys, neighborhoods, houses, and hospitals.' Casualty reports indicate at least 15 people have been killed in the now 40 days of fighting, including six members of the PA and Islamic Jihad commander in the camp, Yazid Ja’aysa. 'Seventy to eighty names remain on the Palestinian Authority’s wanted list after nearly 300 arrests,' a Palestinian source told TPS-IL. PA forces have also uncovered weapons caches including items reportedly stolen from Israeli military bases. Abbas’s ‘Do-Or-Die Campaign’ Publicly, the Palestinian Authority explains the operation as a fight against 'lawbreakers' and against Iranian and Islamic State influence, while one spokesperson stressed that Ramallah 'is not fighting the ‘resistance,’' but against militias who have made life 'unbearable' for Jenin residents. But a senior PA official explained to TPS-IL during the initial raids that the crackdown was part of a broader strategy to demonstrate PA authority’s ability to maintain governance as Ramallah eyes eventually administering the Gaza Strip. One senior Fatah official described the crackdown to TPS-IL in December as a 'do-or-die campaign' for Abbas, who is determined to dismantle what he calls 'resistance nests' in the refugee camp. Previous Israeli counterterror operations in 2023 and 2024 in the Jenin camp uncovered a tunnel shaft, a rocket launcher, large amounts of weapons and bomb-making laboratories. As of 2023, just over 24,000 registered refugees were living in the camp that Palestinians have dubbed 'The Martyr’s Capital.' An Arab diplomat later told TPS-IL that the PA’s raids were insufficient and that Arab leaders are urging US President-elect Donald Trump to replace Abbas. Palestinians have not held national elections since 2005 and Abbas is now in the 19th year of what was supposed to be a four-year term. Since then, Abbas, 89, has cancelled several attempted elections amid Fatah-Hamas disagreements, most recently in 2021. A public opinion survey released in mid-December, found 71% of Palestinians were dissatisfied with the leadership of PA President Mahmoud Abbas.

IAF helicopter intercepts Houthi drone over southern Israel	Since the start of the war on Oct. 7, 2023, Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched around 40 surface-to-surface missiles and 320 UAVs toward Israel, according to the IDF. By JNS An Israeli Air Force helicopter on Monday morning intercepted an armed drone over southern Israel that had been launched from Yemen, according to the Israel Defense Forces. According to protocol, no sirens were activated, the military said. On Wednesday night, Israeli air-defense systems shot down three Houthi drones launched from Yemen, with the military publishing video of one of the interceptions over the Mediterranean Sea. Another UAV was intercepted over the Mediterranean earlier in the day, and a drone was shot down by IAF helicopters, triggering air-raid sirens in Gvulot, a kibbutz in the northwestern Negev. Since the start of the war on Oct. 7, 2023, Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched around 40 surface-to-surface missiles and 320 UAVs toward Israel, according to the IDF. Israeli defenses intercepted most missiles and over 100 drones. Two missile fragments and two UAV hits were identified, while the rest caused no significant damage or failed to reach Israeli territory. 'In recent months, the Houthi terrorist regime in Yemen has conducted scores of aerial attacks against the State of Israel, including with surface-to-surface missiles and UAVs. The Houthi regime serves as a key proxy of the Iranian axis in the Middle East that is responsible for destabilizing the region and disrupting global shipping routes,' the IDF said. On Friday, Israeli fighter jets hit Houthi targets on Yemen’s western coast and inland, the IDF stated. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated on Friday afternoon that 'just as we promised, the Houthis are paying, and will continue to pay, a heavy price for their aggression against us,' according to an English translation of his remarks provided by his office. It was the third time that the IDF had directly attacked Houthi targets in Yemen in the past month. CENTCOM commander visits USS Harry S. Truman Gen.

Israel pushes to retain 1-mile buffer zone in Gaza under ceasefir...	Qatari media outlet claims Israel is pushing for ceasefire deal to recognize Israeli control of a one-mile buffer zone along the Gaza frontier even after IDF forces are withdrawn from most of the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Israel is looking to cement its control over an expanded buffer zone inside the Gaza Strip as part of a proposed ceasefire deal and hostage release, according to an Arabic news report Monday. On Monday morning, the London-based, Qatar-owned Al-Quds Al-Arabi outlet reported that Israel's negotiating team in Doha, Qatar has informed the Egyptian and Qatari brokers mediating talks between Jerusalem and Hamas that the IDF intends to retain long-term control over an expanded buffer zone running along the Israel-Gaza frontier, on the Gazan side of the border. Prior to the Hamas invasion of October 7th, 2023, the IDF had declared a 300-meter (0.186 mile) no-man's land along the border. While the IDF maintained no permanent presence in the buffer zone, it warned Gazans that entering the no-man's land would be treated as a hostile move and could result in live fire from Israeli forces. Following the invasion, Israel began work on an expanded buffer zone, demolishing buildings along the Gaza-side of the border, creating a roughly 1.5-kilometer (0.93 mile) sterile zone. According to Monday's report, Israel has informed meditators it intends to maintain an armed presence in the new buffer zone. The report also claimed that the two sides have largely agreed upon the dimensions of Israel's withdrawal from parts of the Gaza Strip during the first and second phases of a three-phase ceasefire. The United States has expressed cautious optimism regarding the prospects for a deal in the near future, though Hamas has yet to disclose how many hostages are still alive - a key figure necessary for determining the final number of jailed Palestinian terrorists Israel will release as part of an agreement. The two sides also have yet to agree upon which terrorists will be permitted to return home, and which will be required to live in exile abroad. The IDF's control over key strategic areas inside the Gaza Strip after the third and final phase of a ceasefire is another contested issue yet to be resolved.

IAF bombs Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon	Israel launches biggest strikes since truce was implemented, citing Hezbollah's repeated violations of the ceasefire. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli Air Force carried out extensive airstrikes against Hezbollah terror infrastructure and operatives in Lebanon during the early hours of Monday morning, as a truce between Israel and the terror group is set to expire in just two weeks. In a statement, the IDF confirmed it had struck a rocket launching site, unspecified Hezbollah assets, and smuggling routes on the Lebanon-Syria border used by the terror group to obtain weapons. The attacks came after Israel repeatedly complained about Hezbollah's continuing activity in southern Lebanon, which is a clear violation of the truce. The international group responsible for monitoring Hezbollah and ensuring the ceasefire is upheld 'did not address' the threats to Israel, Jerusalem said. بالفيديو | الغارة الاسرائيلية التي استهدفت أطراف دير الزهراني pic.twitter.com/A2VmEL3CAJ &mdash; قناة المنار (@TVManar1) January 12, 2025 'The IDF continues to act to remove any threat to the State of Israel and will operate to prevent any attempt by Hezbollah to rebuild its forces in accordance with the ceasefire understandings,' the military added. According to Arabic-language media, the strikes occurred in the villages of Deir El Zahrani and Houmine El Faouqa in the Nabatiya region of southern Lebanon, as well as in the Bekaa Valley. In late November, Hezbollah and Israel signed a 60-day ceasefire agreement, which is set to expire on January 27th, shortly after president-elect Donald Trump takes office. There have been conflicting media reports regarding Israel's post-ceasefire plans, including whether it will resume widespread strikes against Hezbollah targets. Defense Minister Israel Katz hinted that the IDF could maintain a troop presence in the country - despite pledging to withdraw all of its soldiers by the end of the ceasefire - should the Lebanese army fail to clear southern Lebanon of Hezbollah operatives. However, Biden administration envoy Amos Hochstein was reported to have recently promised Lebanese government officials that Israel would fully withdraw from the country by the time the ceasefire comes to an end.

Vance explains what Trump means by ‘hell breaking loose’ if hosta...	The IDF has said that only two out of twenty-four Hamas battalions remain in Gaza. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump's Vice President J.D. Vance explained on Fox News what Trump meant when he said, 'All hell would break loose' if the hostages in Gaza aren't freed by his inauguration on January 20. Vance said, 'It means enabling the Israelis to knock out the final couple of battalions of Hamas and their leadership. It means very aggressive sanctions and financial penalties on those who are supporting terrorist organizations in the Middle East. It means doing the job of American leadership,' Vance said. The IDF has said that only two out of twenty-four Hamas battalions remain, but the delay in dismantling them is due to intelligence indicating that they are holding most of the remaining hostages, and the IDF is concerned that operations may harm the captives. Vance did not elaborate on the financial sanctions his administration would impose, but it may resemble similar financial penalties the US has placed on terror groups. Vance said, 'We're hopeful there's going to be a deal that struck toward the very end of Biden's administration — maybe the last day or two,' Vance says. 'But regardless of when that deal is struck, it will be because people are terrified that there are going to be consequences for Hamas.' During a high-level security meeting last week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz urged the IDF to draft a plan to completely destroy Hamas if the hostages are not released by the time Donald Trump takes office as US President. Also attending the meeting were IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and senior military commanders. Katz also cautioned the IDF to consider what issues may create obstacles, such as the humanitarian aspect, and encouraged them to make the plan flexible enough to allow the political echelon to make necessary decisions. The Defense Minister added that considerations of post-war governance in Gaza were irrelevant with Hamas still standing, since no nation or group, whether Arab or not, is interested in taking responsibility for running Gaza while the terror group still has a strong presence there.

With eight days left in office, Biden urges Netanyahu to agree to...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved sending an Israeli delegation to Doha to negotiate a hostage deal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News With just eight days left in office, US President Joe Biden, in a phone call on Sunday, insisted that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agree to a ceasefire in Gaza. Biden said there was an immediate need for a ceasefire in Gaza so the hostages could be released and more humanitarian aid could be delivered. In previous negotiations, Netanyahu has insisted that after a pause in fighting to release hostages, the war would resume until Israel achieved its military goals. In the most recent negotiated agreement, Hamas has reportedly relaxed its demand for an immediate withdrawal of IDF troops before the release of the hostages, and Israel's military may be able to remain in the Philadelphi corridor until the final phase. President Biden also described how the situation in the region is 'fundamentally changed' after the ceasefire with Hezbollah and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, weakening Iran's power. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked President Biden and President-elect Donald Trump for cooperating in this sacred mission,' the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. In an interview aired by CNN on Sunday, Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan expressed cautious optimism regarding the chances of a deal being signed before Biden leaves office. 'Can we get it done before the 20th? It is possible, but I certainly can't make any predictions,' Sullivan said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved sending an Israeli delegation to Doha to negotiate a hostage deal. The decision follows a meeting between Netanyahu and US President-elect Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday. In addition, Netanyahu held a situational assessment on the issue of hostages with Defense Minister Israel Katz, Israel's top security officials, and representatives from the Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration. Following the meeting, Netanyahu sent Mossad chief David Barnea, Shin Bet director Ron Bar, IDF hostage point man Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon, and political advisor Ophir Falk to Doha to negotiate the hostage deal.

Israel seizes $1.1 billion Palestinian Authority funds to cover i...	The money that Israel had intended to transfer to the Palestinian Authority after the war will instead go to pay the PA's debts to Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel has recovered funds that will pay for a decade-old $1.1 billion Palestinian Authority electricity debt while diverting money from the Norwegian Fund where money for PA has been deposited since the beginning of the war, Israel HaYom reports. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet Sunday about the process of collecting on the decade-old debt. The Finance Ministry issued an order to the Norwegian Fund, into which Israel had been paying 275 million shekels monthly deducted from PA funds. The money from the Norwegian Fund will pay for outstanding debts the PA has owed to Israel for over 10 years. Half of the funds will be paid to companies that provided fuel to the PA, and the other half will go to Israel's electric company. Last spring, when Norway announced that it recognized a Palestinian State, Smotrich stopped sending money to the Norwegian Fund and accumulated the money separately. The money that Israel had intended to transfer to the Palestinian Authority after the war will instead go to pay the PA's debts to Israel. The process, which is being carried out in coordination with the US, is succeeding in securing the debt payment in full without reducing interest. Last May, Smotrich refused to extend a waiver to allow Israel's banks to work with Palestinian banks, citing their close association with terror groups. Smotrich stated he had no intention to extend the waiver to Palestinian banks, saying that 'The PA's financial system is up to its neck in terror,' and wrote on X, 'They back and fund terror.' The Norwegian Fund was created as a way to transfer money between Israel and the Palestinian Authority without forcing Israel to work directly with Palestinian banks. However, when Norway declared a Palestinian State unilaterally, Smotrich refused to transfer the funds. Smotrich wrote, 'There's urgency for an immediate response that will impose a significant cost on the Palestinian Authority for its actions and deter it and other countries,' Smotrich concluded.

Fatah and Palestinian Authority issue unprecedented condemnation ...	The statement criticized Hamas for 'using civilians as shields, resulting in catastrophic casualties and the collapse of essential services such as healthcare and education in Gaza.' By Jewish Breaking News The Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah) released a strong statement condemning Hamas for its actions leading up to and following the October 7, 2023, attacks, describing them as 'disastrous for the Palestinian people.' Fatah accused Hamas of 'aligning itself with Iran and other regional forces, gambling with Palestinian interests, and triggering the largest destruction Gaza has faced in recent history.' The statement criticized Hamas for 'using civilians as shields, resulting in catastrophic casualties and the collapse of essential services such as healthcare and education in Gaza.' Fatah further rejected Hamas’s attempts to extend its influence to the 'West Bank,' accusing the group of 'inciting chaos, treason, and supporting outlaws.' The statement condemned Hamas’s long-standing practices, including 'alleged executions, kidnappings, and misappropriation of humanitarian aid.' Reaffirming their 'commitment to the Palestinian national project,' Fatah emphasized the sacrifices made by Palestinian security forces to maintain independence from external manipulation, particularly Iranian influence. They vowed to protect Palestinian sovereignty against any party seeking to exploit it. This marks a very rare and pointed denunciation of Hamas by Palestinian leadership.

Ryanair to resume full schedule to Israel this summer	The three major U.S. legacy carriers are still not flying to and from Israel as the war against Hamas in Gaza continues. By JNS Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair plans to operate a full flight schedule to Israel this summer, when it expects travel to and from Tel Aviv to return to normal, an airline executive said this week. Europe’s biggest budget airline, which has not flown to Israel for nearly a year, was previously expected to resume service to Israel this spring. 'We rely on EASA [European Union Aviation Safety Agency] guidance …, but our view is that we will be back,' Eddie Wilson, chief executive of Ryanair DAC, the largest of five subsidiary airlines operated by the Ryanair Group told Reuters. 'We’ve got a full schedule I think for Tel Aviv …, so we will be back in there for the summer as I think most of the other airlines will be.' Low-cost rival Hungarian-based Wizz Air restarted service from Ben-Gurion International Airport last month, and is expanding service to seven more destinations this week: Abu Dhabi, Budapest, Krakow, London, Milan, Rome and Warsaw. Several foreign airlines have resumed flights to Israel since the Nov. 27 ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, with the major European carriers including Air France, British Airways and the Lufthansa group expected to restart service next month. The three major U.S. legacy carriers are still not flying to and from Israel as the war against Hamas in Gaza continues. United and American Airlines have suspended flights to Israel indefinitely, while Delta is scheduled to resume flights to Tel Aviv in April. United and Delta sought to restart flights to Israel periodically over the last year, only to extend the suspension of service following flareups in the war, while American has stayed away entirely. January and February are typically the slowest months for travel to Israel. About one-third of the 80 airlines that serviced Tel Aviv before the outbreak of the war have since resumed service, an Israel Airport Authority spokeswoman told JNS this week. Last month, the Knesset gave preliminary approval to an amendment to the law requiring airlines to compensate passengers for canceled flights, easing the requirements during wartime. The initial parliamentary vote, which the foreign airlines had lobbied for last year, did not lead them to rush back to Israel. Israel shuttered its low-cost Terminal 1 at Ben-Gurion International Airport during the war, which offers lower ground operating costs to the carriers, but is likely to reopen it with the budget airlines’ resumption of service. Meanwhile, the five most popular destinations for Israelis traveling abroad last year were Greece with more than 1.8 million passengers, the U.S. with about 1.4 million passengers, Cyprus with about 1 million passengers, the United Arab Emirates with about 890,000 passengers, and France with about 850,000 passengers, according to the Israel Airport Authority 2024 annual report. In a year when most foreign airlines suspended service to Tel Aviv, El Al had a near-monopoly on flights out of Israel, flying about 6.5 million passengers, followed by Israel’s budget carriers Israir with about 1.4 million passengers, and Arkia with about 1 million passengers. Fly Dubai, which has flown throughout the war, and the Greece-based Blue Bird served about half a million passengers each.

3,000 terrorists to be freed in hostage deal – report	Palestinian report claims current hostage deal on the table would include the release of some 3,000 jailed terrorists - including hundreds now serving life sentences. By World Israel News Staff Israel could potentially release as many as 3,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists as part of a hostage deal now on the table in ceasefire talks in Doha, Qatar, a Palestinian source claimed Sunday. According to a report published by the Bethlehem-based Ma'an News Agency, the latest draft of a possible hostage deal under consideration would during the first phase of a ceasefire, provide for the freeing of 25 Israeli hostages currently being held in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for the freeing of approximately 1,050 jailed terrorists. The report cited Qadura Fares, the Palestinian Authority's Minister for Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs, who claimed that during the first phase of a three-phase ceasefire, 48 Palestinian terrorists freed as part of the 2011 Shalit deal and subsequently rearrested for new terror activities would be released again, along with 1,000 other terrorists. The 1,000 terrorists to be included in the first phase of the deal will be drawn from a list of female terrorists, terrorists under the age of 18, and terrorists with serious medical conditions. During the second and third phases of the deal now under consideration, Fares continued, Israel would release an additional 2,000 jailed terrorists, in exchange for the release of all remaining hostages - alive and dead. Some 200 of the terrorists to be released during the first phase of the ceasefire will be those serving life sentences, Fares said - referring to terrorists convicted of murder. While most of the terrorists freed under a potential deal would be allowed to return home, Fares said, those convicted of the most serious offenses would be expelled from the country and forced to live in exile in either Qatar, Turkey, or Egypt. Israel's top negotiator, Mossad chief David Barnea, is slated to depart for Doha to lead the latest round of talks, Netanyahu said Saturday, after his trip to Qatar was delayed last week.

Trump’s incoming Ukraine envoy urges ‘maximum pressure’ on Iran	Kellogg stressed that the opportunity to improve Iran is fleeting and must be seized. By JNS Keith Kellogg, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming Ukraine and Russia special envoy, called for a return to a 'maximum pressure' policy against Iran on Saturday, aiming to push the country toward democracy. Speaking at a Paris-based Iranian opposition event, he emphasized that pressure should be both economic and diplomatic, not just military, according to Reuters. Kellogg stressed that the opportunity to improve Iran is fleeting and must be seized. 'We must exploit the weakness we now see. The hope is there, so must too be the action,' he told the audience at the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) event at the group’s headquarters in Auvers-sur-Oise on the northwestern outskirts of the French capital. NCRI President-elect Maryam Rajavi also called for Western governments to support the Iranian people and abandon outdated policies, citing regional shifts against Iran’s leadership. Trump has pledged to reinstate the policy from his previous term, which aimed to devastate Iran’s economy to compel the country to negotiate on its nuclear program, ballistic missile development and regional actions.

Los Angeles wildfires death toll rises as crews fight heavy winds...	Crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico. By Associated Press The death toll from the wildfires ravaging the Los Angeles area rose to 16 as crews battled to cut off the spreading blazes before potentially strong winds return that could push the flames toward some of the city’s most famous landmarks. Five of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire and 11 resulted from the Eaton Fire, the Los Angeles County coroner’s office said in a statement Saturday evening. The previous number of confirmed fatalities before Saturday was 11, but officials said they expected that figure to rise as teams with cadaver dogs conduct systematic grid searches in leveled neighborhoods. Authorities have established a center where people can report the missing. There were fears that winds could move the fires toward the J. Paul Getty Museum and the University of California, Los Angeles, while new evacuation warnings left more homeowners on edge. By Saturday evening, Cal Fire reported the Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth and Hurst fires had consumed about 62 square miles (160 square kilometers), an area larger than San Francisco. The Palisades and Eaton fires accounted for 59 square miles (nearly 153 square kilometers). In a briefing posted online Saturday evening, Michael Traum of the California Office of Emergency Services said 150,000 people in Los Angeles County were under evacuation orders, with more than 700 people taking refuge in nine shelters. Crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico, he said. With Cal Fire reporting containment of the Palisades Fire at 11% and the Eaton Fire at 15% on Saturday night, the fight is set to continue. 'Weather conditions are still critical and another round of strong winds is expected starting Monday,' Traum said. Fighting to save public and private areas A fierce battle occurred Saturday in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities not far from the Pacific coast, where swooping helicopters dumped water as the blaze charged downhill. Firefighters on the ground used hoses in an attempt to beat back leaping flames as thick smoke blanketed the chaparral-covered hillside. CalFire Operations Chief Christian Litz said Saturday that a main focus was the Palisades Fire burning in the canyon area, not far from the UCLA campus. New evacuations were ordered Friday evening after a flare up on the eastern side of the Palisades Fire. The National Weather Service warned that strong Santa Ana winds could soon return. Those winds have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires into infernos that leveled entire neighborhoods around to city where there has been no significant rainfall in more than eight months. The fire also threatened to jump over Interstate 405 and into densely populated areas in the Hollywood Hills and San Fernando Valley. Historical cost The fires that began Tuesday just north of downtown LA have burned more than 12,000 structures. Firefighters for the first time made progress Friday afternoon on the Eaton Fire north of Pasadena, which has burned more than 7,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and vehicles. Most evacuation orders for the area were lifted, officials said. No cause has been determined for the largest fires and early estimates indicate the wildfires could be the nation's costliest ever. A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. Overflowing kindness Volunteers overflowed donation centers and some had to be turned away at locations including the Santa Anita Park horse racing track, where people who lost their homes sifted through stacks of donated shirts, blankets and other household goods. Altadena resident Jose Luis Godinez said three homes occupied by more than a dozen of his family members were destroyed. 'Everything is gone,' he said, speaking in Spanish. 'All my family lived in those three houses and now we have nothing.' Officials warn against returning Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna warned residents against venturing back to destroyed homes to sift through rubble for keepsakes. 'We have people driving up and around trying to get in just to look. Stay away,' Luna said, urging people to abide by curfews. Officials on Saturday warned the ash can contain lead, arsenic, asbestos and other harmful materials. 'If you’re kicking that stuff up, you’re breathing it in,' said Chris Thomas, a spokesman for the unified incident command at the Palisades Fire who warned the material was 'toxic.' Residents will be allowed to return with protective gear after damage teams evaluate their properties, Thomas said. Leadership accused of skimping LA Mayor Karen Bass faces a critical test of her leadership during the city's greatest crisis in decades, but allegations of leadership failures, political blame and investigations have begun. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 117 million-gallon (440 million-liter) reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry. Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said city leadership failed her department by not providing enough money for firefighting. She also criticized the lack of water. 'When a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there’s going to be water,' Crowley said. The level of devastation is jarring even in a state that regularly confronts massive wildfires. Traum of the state Office of Emergency Services said those impacted by the fires can apply online for immediate government assistance.

Pope Francis slams Israel over ‘shameful’ humanitarian situation ...	The 88-year-old pontiff accused Israel of 'bombing civilians' and leaving Gazan children to 'freeze to death,' slamming the Jewish state over what he called the 'shameful' situation in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Pope Francis blasted Israel in an address last week, castigating the Jewish state over what he described as the 'shameful' humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip during the ongoing war against Hamas. On Thursday, an aide to the pontiff delivered Pope Francis' 2025 State of the World speech, after a cold left the pope unable to give the address personally. In the address, Pope Francis called for a 'diplomacy of home' and a 'diplomacy of freedom,' to replace what he termed the 'horrid commerce' of war. Lamenting the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the pope touched on other high-profile conflicts around the world, calling for international efforts to end the fighting. Pope Francis advocated for the release of Israeli hostages held by terrorists in the Gaza Strip, while demanding more international aid for Gazans and the establishment of a Palestinian state. 'I renew my appeal for a ceasefire and the release of the Israeli hostages in Gaza, where there is a very serious and shameful humanitarian situation, and I ask that the Palestinian population receive all the aid it needs.' 'My prayerful hope is that Israelis and Palestinians can rebuild the bridges of dialogue and mutual trust, starting with the smallest, so that future generations can live side by side in the two States, in peace and security, and that Jerusalem can be the 'city of encounter', where Christians, Jews and Muslims live together in harmony and respect.' The 88-year-old Catholic cleric also reiterated his support for the negotiating of a new nuclear deal with Tehran. 'More recently, I think of the positive signs of a resumption of negotiations to return to the framework of the Iran nuclear deal, with the aim of ensuring a safer world for all.' Last year, Pope Francis repeatedly criticized Israel's handling of the war in Gaza, and suggested that the IDF may be guilty of genocide in the coastal enclave. 'This is cruelty, this is not war,' Pope Francis declared during a speech on December 21st, drawing sharp criticism not only from Israel but from Jewish and Christian groups abroad.

New Israeli study reveals how terrorists are weaponizing AI	The study outlines the most likely risks associated with terrorists’ access to AI technology: By Jewish Breaking News Artificial intelligence technology could be exploited by terrorist groups around the globe in a number of ways, a new study has found, while governmental regulatory agencies and tech companies appear to be woefully unprepared to deal with the growing threat. The 'Generative AI and Terrorism' study, conducted by the University of Haifa’s Prof. Gabriel Weimann, will be published in his forthcoming book, AI in Society. Weimann unmasks the real and pertinent threats associated with the growing interest in AI-based tools among terrorists and extremists. From online manuals on how to use generative AI to bolster propaganda and disinformation tactics to an Al-Qaeda-affiliated group announcing it would start holding AI workshops online to Islamic State’s tech support guide on how to use generative AI tools such as chatbots like ChatGPT securely. 'We are in the midst of a rapid technological revolution, no less significant than the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries – the artificial intelligence revolution,' Weimann writes. 'This multi-dimensional dramatic revolution is raising the concern that human society is unprepared for the rise of artificial intelligence.' The study outlines the most likely risks associated with terrorists’ access to AI technology: Effective propaganda, where AI can be used to produce and distribute influential content to various target populations, faster and more efficiently than ever before and disseminate hate speech, radical and violent ideologies for recruitment purposes. Spreading disinformation which can serve terrorists in their fear-inducing campaigns, and AI models can be a powerful weapon in modern disinformation wars by utilizing technology like deep fakes which can quickly reach huge audiences in an extremely short period of time. Interactive recruitment where AI-based chatbots can facilitate and enhance the recruitment of individuals for terrorist plots by automating virtual interactions with targeted individuals and can improve the reach of the virtual interactivity of targeted individuals and groups. Enhancing attack capabilities, where deep-learning models such as ChatGPT have the potential to enable terrorists to learn, plan, and coordinate their activities with greater efficiency, accuracy, and impact than ever before.

Actress Jamie Lee Curtis compares fire-ravaged LA to Gaza Strip	Lamenting Los Angeles wildfires, Southern California native Jamie Lee Curtis compares damage to Palisades neighborhood to war in the Gaza Strip, drawing criticism on social media. By World Israel News Staff A Hollywood A-lister came under fire last week, after she compared fire-ravaged neighborhoods in Los Angeles to the war-torn Gaza Strip. Jamie Lee Curtis, the 66-year-old actress and former 'scream queen' who starred in the Halloween film series and A Fish Called Wanda, spoke out Thursday at an event marking the debut of her latest film, The Last Showgirl. During a question and answer session, Curtis commented on the four ongoing wildfires raging in the Los Angeles area, including the massive Pacific Palisades fire. 'I'm born and raised in the City of Angels,' Curtis said, 'and the entire City of Angels is on fire everywhere. The entire city. The Pacific Palisades is gone.' 'My house tonight is still there, but I live in a different canyon,' Curtis continued, before comparing the damage in Los Angeles to the Gaza war. 'But the entire Pacific Palisades looks like, unfortunately, Gaza or one of these war-torn countries where awful things have happened. And there are now fires breaking out everywhere. It feels totally bizarre to be talking about a movie. But it is a piece of art, and art will save us - no matter what.' Social media users quicky pounced on Curtis' comments, with some denouncing the comparison as insensitive, while others blasted Curtis over her support for Israel after the October 7th invasion. 'This is a completely atrocious comparison considering this is the same woman who advocated for Israel’s genocide in Gaza,' wrote one user. Another, under the handle @lizziesjuul, wrote: 'i live in california and you would never find me comparing these fires to gaza…both tragedies but not comparable AT ALL.'

Iran holding war games as it faces Israel tensions, Trump’s retur...	In these exercises, … defense systems will practice the fight against air, missile, and electronic warfare threats in real battlefield conditions… to protect the country’s skies and sensitive and vital areas,' Iranian state television said. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Iran was holding air defense exercises on Saturday, state media reported, as the country braces for more friction with arch-enemy Israel and the United States under incoming US president Donald Trump. The war games take place as Iranian leaders face the risk that Trump could empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran’s nuclear sites, while further tightening US sanctions on its oil industry through his 'maximum pressure' policy. 'In these exercises, … defense systems will practice the fight against air, missile and electronic warfare threats in real battlefield conditions… to protect the country’s skies and sensitive and vital areas,' Iranian state television said. Saturday’s drills are part of two-months-long exercises launched on Jan. 4 which have already included war games in which the elite Revolutionary Guards defended key nuclear installations in Natanz against mock attacks by missiles and drones, state media said. Iran’s military has said it was using new drones and missiles in the exercises and released footage of a new underground 'missile city' being visited by Guards Commander-in-Chief Major General Hossein Salami. Iran has recently suffered setbacks in Lebanon after Israeli attacks against Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the toppling of Tehran’s ally President Bashar Al-Assad in Syria last month. But Salami warned, in a speech carried by state TV about a 'false sense of delight' among Iran’s enemies, saying Iran and particularly its missile forces were stronger than ever. While Iranian officials have downplayed Iran’s setbacks, an Iranian general, Behrouz Esbati, who was reportedly based in Syria, said in a speech circulated on social media that Iran had 'badly lost' in Syria. Reuters could not verify the recording. Trump in 2018 withdrew from a deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 in which Iran agreed to curb uranium enrichment, which can yield material for nuclear weapons, in return for the relaxation of US and U.N. economic sanctions.

Israel mulling new security zone in Syria to protect Golan – repo...	It is 'incredible' that the West is rushing to help the new regime when it is led by Muslim extremists, Israeli official says. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Senior Israeli officials said Thursday that Israel will need to maintain an operational presence 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) wide inside Syrian territory to ensure the safety of Golan Heights residents. Moreover, they said that a full 60-km radius of influence under the control of Israeli intelligence is also required to prevent potential threats such as missile launchings from emerging from the surrounding areas. 'We’re building an operational concept for this new reality,' said one official, who expressed amazement that Western countries, including the U.S., are rushing to have a relationship with the Muslim extremist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that felled the decades-long Ba’athist regime last month. These democracies were purposefully 'choosing to be blind' when dealing with 'some of the most dangerous people in the world,' who hail from ISIS and al-Qaida, groups whose stated goal is to brutally install a Muslim caliphate wherever they gain power. Notably, the Biden administration has already reduced some sanctions and removed a $10 million bounty that had been placed on the head of HTS chief and de facto Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa ten years ago. 'It’s incredible how the world has fallen into this trap again,' the official said, noting that 'The Arab world surrounding us understands the threat and is warning the West but they refuse to listen.' Germany, France, the U.S. and others have sent representatives to meet with Syria’s new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, who has talked as if he is no longer a Muslim fanatic, saying that his regime will protect minorities and is not interested in fighting Israel, among other things that are music to Western ears. At the same time, he has requested both massive financial aid to reconstruct Syria, and that Israel’s allies pressure Jerusalem into withdrawing the forces it rushed to the demilitarized zone between the two countries when the lightning takeover took place, and has maintained there ever since. The IDF has also bombed and destroyed much of Syria’s most dangerous weapons and air defense, its entire navy and a vital missile-producing facility, and continues operations as needed, which the new regime says should stop immediately. Israel cannot afford to be as gullible as the West, the official indicated. The new regime’s détente with Israel 'might hold true for a year, two years, maybe even 10 or 20,' the official said. 'But no one can guarantee that eventually, they won’t turn against us – and these are highly dangerous people.' The official noted other potential threats as well, including al-Sharaa allowing safe residency to fellow Sunni Jihadist organizations such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), whose forces are still battling the IDF in the Gaza Strip since their invasion of Israel and slaughter of 1,200 people last October 7. 'We won’t allow their establishment in Syria just as we prevented Iran’s foothold there,' the official said. 'We estimate that al-Sharaa prefers to keep them there so they can act against Israel, giving him plausible deniability.' Israel is at least not too worried about Iran itself regaining influence in Syria, considering that as Shiite Muslims who propped up the former Assad regime, the mullahs and their chief terror proxy, Hezbollah, are persona non grata in the country.

Lawmaker bolts Yesh Atid party, forms new Knesset faction	Former Deputy Foreign Minister Idan Roll announces his departure from the Yesh Atid party and the formation of a new party, dubbed the National Majority. By World Israel News Staff A Knesset member from the center-left Yesh Atid faction announced Sunday morning that he has resigned from the party and plans to establish a new faction in the Knesset. MK Idan Roll, 40, took to X/Twitter to reveal that he has informed Opposition Leader and Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid that he has decided to leave the party, reducing its Knesset delegation from 24 seats to 23. Roll, who previously served as Deputy Foreign Minister, said that he will retain his Knesset seat and establish a new political movement, tentatively dubbed the 'National Majority.' 'The October 7th was a double wake-up call for us,' Roll tweeted. 'For the first time, we awoke to a war of survival, which revealed in our people tremendous strength and a willingness to sacrifice and give in defense of our common home. For the second time, we awoke to the recognition of the common identity that binds us together, and that our common interest in the existence of the state is stronger than anything that separated us.' 'The large and courageous public that rose up on October 7 to fight for the country and restore it must also take its place in the national leadership. But for this to happen, we must open the closed club of the Knesset and ensure that the State of Israel does not miss a historic opportunity for change.' 'This morning, I informed the chairman of the Yesh Atid faction, MK Yair Lapid, of my resignation from the party and my departure for an independent path.' 'I will continue to serve the public as a constructive opposition and work to open the gates of the Knesset for political and ideological renewal. I thank Lapid for the shared path and the privilege of serving the country alongside him as Deputy Foreign Minister and as a member of Knesset. Yesh Atid was a political home for me and I am full of appreciation for my members of the faction, the party leadership, and the dedicated activists.' A former male model who initially joined the Likud party as a member of the liberal 'New Likudniks' movement, Roll first entered the Knesset on the Blue and White ticket in 2019, after joining the Yesh Atid party.

IDF probe finds kibbutz members likely killed by friendly fire on...	Dikla Arava was shot in her car while being kidnapped, son Tomer was hiding in bushes in Nahal Oz. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A mother and son in Kibbutz Nahal Oz were likely killed accidentally by IDF forces battling Hamas terrorists there on October 7, the army said on Friday. While saying that 'It is not possible to determine with complete certainty what caused' the deaths of Dikla Arava and her son, Tomer Eliaz Arava, the IDF presented as full a picture as it could based on 'various sources' as well as eyewitness testimony of soldiers, commanders and members of the kibbutz who were there at the time. According to the report, which was presented to the family on Thursday, the chronology of events showed that on the morning of the mass invasion from Gaza, after dozens of terrorists overran the kibbutz, several broke into the Arava-Elyakim family home and shot at the door of the safe room where the family was hiding and took the family captive. As a result of this shooting, the head of the family, Noam Elyakim, was wounded badly in the leg. The terrorists then used Dikla’s cell phone to broadcast a live video feed on Facebook of forcing Tomer, 17, at gunpoint, to walk around the nearby houses in the kibbutz and call on the neighbors to come out of their homes. 'After about an hour and a half,' the report said, 'Tomer managed to escape from the terrorists and hide. A few minutes later, a combat force, which had been engaged in intense fighting for six hours in the kibbutz' against the numerous infiltrators, 'identified a suspicious figure' and shot at him several times. The investigation concluded that this person was most likely Tomer, who was killed by this tragic case of mistaken identification. As for his mother, the report said that terrorists put her in the family’s car along with her partner, Noam, and his two daughters, Ela (8) and Dafna (15), and started driving towards the Gaza border to take them hostage. The analysis of events concluded that 'amid fierce combat with numerous terrorists,' IDF soldiers shot at the fleeing car, hitting it in the back, and that it was 'a reasonable possibility' that at least one of the bullets killed Dikla. 'After the shooting, the terrorists abandoned the vehicle within the kibbutz, leaving behind' her body, the report stated. Noam’s body was also found later. The two girls were eventually released among others from the kibbutz and more than 80 other Israeli women and children in the only hostage deal to date, in late November 2023. The team leading the investigation was headed by Col. (res.) Yaron Sitbon, who is also in charge of the parallel inquiry into the entire 12-hour battle for Nachal Oz, which has yet to be completed, the army said. Twelve other kibbutz members were murdered by the terrorists on the kibbutz, as well as a student from Tanzania whose body was stolen into Gaza, and a Border Police officer who was killed in the battles. Two members of the kibbutz, Tsachi Idan and Omri Miran, are still being held hostage in the Gaza Strip. The IDF expressed its 'deep condolences to the Arava-Eliaz-Elyakim family and the Nahal Oz community' upon presenting the report. The kibbutz published a statement calling the investigation 'unbearably difficult and heartbreaking.'

Israel, Hamas want hostage deal before Trump inaugurated: Report	Hamas has still not provided Israel with a list of living hostages, as reports indicate progress made in talks. By World Israel News Staff Israel and the Hamas terror group are aiming to secure a hostage and ceasefire deal before incoming president-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20th, an Israeli official told Hebrew-language outlet Mako. On Saturday, Trump's envoy to the Middle East Steven Witkoff traveled to Israel from Doha, Qatar, where the ongoing talks are being held. Witkoff met with Prime Minister Benjamín Netanyahu and other senior officials. According to a Mako report, Witkoff conveyed that Trump 'wants to see a deal' before his inauguration. A source involved in the Doha talks told Mako that 'there is a desire on all sides to try and reach an agreement before January 20th.' An Israeli delegation, including Mossad head David Barnea and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, departed for Doha, Qatar late Saturday evening, signaling that the negotiations may be reaching a critical stage. 'If there wasn’t real progress, Netanyahu wouldn’t have decided to send a delegation to Doha for the hostage deal talks,' an official told the Jerusalem Post. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a media statement that they welcomed the decision to send the Israel delegation to Qatar. 'We call on the delegation: This is a historic opportunity to secure the release of all our loved ones,' the Forum said. Notably, Hamas has still not provided Israel with a list of living hostages, which Jerusalem has maintained as a basic condition before negotiations can progress. A rough outline of the potential deal, widely reported by international media, involves three stages focused on the Philadelphia Corridor. In the first phase of the deal, Israel would pull back its troop presence along the corridor. In the second phase, the IDF will remain at a limited number of sites near the corridor. The third phase would see Israel completely withdraw from the Philadelphia corridor, despite previous insistence that such a condition is a non-starter.

Settlement leaders to attend Trump’s inauguration	Representatives of the Israeli settler movement invited to President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration later this month. By World Israel News Staff A delegation representing Israeli towns and cities in Judea and Samaria will attend President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday, January 20th, an organization aligned with the settlement announced over the weekend. The Yesha Council, an umbrella organization representing the Israeli municipal bodies across Judea and Samaria, said Saturday night that it will be dispatching a delegation next week, after the Trump transition team invited settlement leaders to attend the incoming president's inauguration. 'Next week, a delegation from the Yesha Council will participate in the inauguration ceremony of President Trump,' the council wrote on its Facebook account. The delegation is slated to include several prominent leaders from the Yesha Council, including council chairman Israel Ganz, who also serves as mayor of the Binyamin Regional Council, Samaria Regional Council mayor Yossi Dagan, and Oranit Mayor Or Peron-Zumer. 'We are leaving on behalf of Judea and Samaria residents to stand alongside our friend and President Trump at the inauguration,' Ganz said, according to Arutz Sheva. 'The invitation we received from the administration reflects shared values between Israel, the settlements, and the U.S. rooted in biblical principles.' 'We share a common value struggle against the global axis of evil, with the settlements being the spearhead protecting Israel, the U.S., and the free world. We believe significant achievements can bring stability to the world order, and we wish Trump success in this endeavor. We continue to strengthen ties with top administration officials for this purpose.' During their visit, the delegation will present the new president with a letter thanking him for his recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and the relocation of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Last month, the Trump transition team issued invitations to the Yesha Council leaders. In 2017, a smaller delegation representing the Yesha Council was invited to Trump's first presidential inauguration. The Trump transition team has also invited to the inauguration ceremony the families of seven American hostages held captive in the Gaza Strip.

‘Make the UK Khamenei-free,’ says anti-nuclear Iran campaign	Iranian influence centers throughout Europe disseminate radical Islamic ideology pushed by the Ayatollah, says watchdog group. By World Israel News Staff A group campaigning to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is raising awareness about Tehran's networks within the United Kingdom, urging Brits to root out centers of influence controlled by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), a non-partisan group based in the U.S., is raising awareness about Iran-backed Islamic extremism centers in Great Britain. In a video kicking off the #KhameneiFreeZone campaign, UANI's head of IRGC research, Kasra Aarabi, explained how deeply Iran has infiltrated Europe. 'I'm outside the office of Ayatollah Khamenei. but I'm not in Tehran. I'm in London, in the heart of Europe,' Aarabi said, as the Islamic Centre England (ICE) is seen in the background. According to UANI, ICE functions as Khamenei's headquarters in the UK, with speakers and events at the center supporting his agenda. As UANI’s 2025 campaign gains momentum, it will start in the United Kingdom this month and move on to additional major European capitals this year. View the #KhameneiFreeZone Campaign video below and visit the resource here: pic.twitter.com/SLdF20pDMo &mdash; UANI (@UANI) January 8, 2025 On its website, UANI points to a number of incidents at ICE, including a video filmed at the center which saw British children singing a song in which they 'pledge their allegiance to Khamenei and their willingness to join an apocalyptic army to kill Jews and infidels.' 'Khamenei has bult a network of infiltration centers across Europe which target our communities, support terrorism, promote extreme antisemitism, and even seek to recruit and radicalize European nationals,' Hiva Wallace, a senior advisor to UANI. 'Shockingly&#8230;some of the IRGC's most violent and extreme commanders were hosted by Khamenei's London-based Islamic Students Association,' continued Wallace. UANI listed a number of regime-backed speakers hosted by the ISA, including Saeed Ghasemi, who previously 'boasted about training al-Qaeda operatives in Europe.' Hossein Yetka, another speaker, claimed that 'Jews created homosexuality.' Despite being subject to UK sanctions for 'gross human rights violations,' senior IRGC Ali Fazli was permitted to lecture British students. The goal of the UANI is to ensure that European governments take the threat of Iranian influence seriously, and shutter Islamic centers and associations where radical ideology pushed by Tehran is disseminated.

Hamas, PA clash over Jenin anti-terror operation	PA accuses Hamas of sacrificing Gaza for Iranian interests. By World Israel News Staff The Palestinian Authority and Hamas are trading barbs, as the PA conducts an extensive anti-terror operation in Jenin, which has long been a haven for Hamas and its affiliated groups. Hamas official Abdul Rahman Shadid blasted the PA in a media statement, claiming that the entity's security forces were given 'shoot-to-kill' orders and told to target Hamas terrorists. Referencing an incident last week, which saw PA forces shoot three Hamas operatives in a vehicle, critically wounding one, Shadid said that the PA 'issued instructions to liquidate and kill resistance fighters in the West Bank.' Shadid added that the PA is 'increasingly willing to shed Palestinian blood, as evidenced by the events in Jenin refugee camp over the past 38 days, during which nine Palestinians, including women and children, have been killed.' The PA's ruling Fatah party responded by warning Hamas that it will not allow the terror group to usurp power in any of its territory within Judea and Samaria. In a media statement, Fatah stressed that 'Hamas, which has jeopardized the interests and resources of the Palestinian people in favor of Iran and caused the destruction of Gaza' will never be permitted to 'reproduce its activities in the West Bank.' Notably, Fatah also emphasized that Hamas regularly uses civilians 'as human shields, instead of protecting them and their homes.' Fatah pointed the finger at Iran, saying that they would not lend a hand to Tehran's 'expansionist ambitions to turn Palestine into an area of influence, even at the cost of the blood of Palestinian children.' The media back-and-forth comes as the PA's security forces have been carrying out a massive raid in Jenin, aimed at rooting out terror groups from the city. The clashes have seen gun battles in the streets of the city, between armed terrorists and PA police.

US envoy Hochstein: ‘Israel will withdraw from Lebanon in two wee...	Hochstein reportedly said he had consulted with Israeli officials and had obtained 'a detailed timeline for the withdrawal.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US special envoy Amos Hochstein has reportedly told Lebanese officials that the IDF will withdraw from Lebanon by January 26, before the end of the six-week ceasefire deal, Lebanon's Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar reports. According to the news outlet, Hochstein delivered this assurance during meetings with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. Hochstein reportedly said he had consulted with Israeli officials and had obtained 'a detailed timeline for the withdrawal,' adding that 'January 26 will be the final date for Israeli forces in Lebanon.' Hochstein also urged the Lebanese army to 'fill the void' that will be left by the departure of Israeli forces. He emphasized the requirement to transfer all weapons south of the Litani River from Hezbollah to the Lebanese army. Lebanese military forces reportedly told Hochstein that the transition 'will unfold naturally.' Last month, Israeli leaders warned Beirut that if the current ceasefire with Hezbollah fails due to Lebanon's failure to enforce the truce in its territory, Israel will hold the Lebanese government responsible. Following a serious breach of the ceasefire agreement when Hezbollah shelled Mount Dov in Israeli territory, Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a stern warning that should the truce continue to be violated and the ceasefire agreement collapse, Israel will not limit its retaliatory strikes to Hezbollah itself, but will instead hold the Lebanese government responsible. 'There will no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon,' Katz said while visiting Israel's northern border Tuesday. 'We will work with all our might to enforce all the understandings of the ceasefire agreement, and we show maximum response and zero tolerance.' 'Yesterday was the first test, the shooting at Mount Dov. We reacted strongly, and this is exactly what we will do, and we will not allow Hezbollah to return to the old methods they had, such as the [Hezbollah] tent that was set up and not attacked.' Katz demanded that Beirut 'authorize the Lebanese army to enforce their part, to keep Hezbollah away beyond the Litani and to dismantle all the infrastructure.'

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Saturday, the IDF released the names of four soldiers who were killed in Gaza. The soldiers were Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Alexander Fedorenko, St.-Sgt. Danila Diakov, Sgt. Yahav Maayan, and Sgt. Eliav Astuker. Fedorenko, 37, was a resident of Bat Yam and served as a truck driver in the IDF's 79th Battalion of the 14th Brigade. The other three soldiers were significantly younger, and all served in the 931st Battalion of the Nahal Brigade. Diakov, 21, was from Ma'ale Adumim; Maayan, 19, was from Modi'in; and Astuker, 19, was from Ashdod. The IDF also reported that a reservist officer in the Nahal Brigade and a soldier from the 931st Battalion were severely injured on Saturday. Both were evacuated to a hospital for medical treatment. The soldiers were killed when they were ambushed by terrorists while traveling in a convoy in Beit Hanoun in Gaza. Regarding the death of Danila Diakov, Maaleh Adumim Mayor Guy Yifrach announced, 'Dear residents, it is with deep sorrow and profound grief that I announce the death in battle in Gaza of a beloved city resident, Nahal Brigade soldier, and Israeli hero, Staff Sergeant Danila Diakov. May his blood be avenged by G-d.' 'Our hearts are with his cherished family—his parents, Alexander and Natalia, and his sisters, Alina and Maya—who today received the most heartbreaking news. Details regarding the procession and funeral will be shared separately.' 'The family of Amit Yud School in Ashdod is deeply pained and mourning the loss of our graduate, Eliav Astuker, may G-d avenge his blood,' said the school's principal, Yaron Carmi. 'Eliav was a young man beloved by his friends and teachers alike.' 'His decision to enlist in a combat unit was natural, driven by his desire to serve his people and his country. His loss is an immense tragedy, and our hearts go out to his dear parents and the entire family. We will honor Eliav's memory and continue to educate in his spirit.'

Netanyahu sends Israeli delegation to negotiate hostage deal in D...	Channel 13 cited two sources who said there was 'cautious progress' in the hostage deal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved sending an Israeli delegation to Doha to negotiate a hostage deal. The decision follows a meeting between Netanyahu and US President-elect Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday. In addition, Netanyahu held a situational assessment on the issue of hostages with Defense Minister Israel Katz, Israel's top security officials, and representatives from the Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration. Following the meeting, Netanyahu sent Mossad chief David Barnea, Shin Bet director Ron Bar, IDF hostage point man Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon, and political advisor Ophir Falk to Doha to negotiate the hostage deal. Channel 13 cited two sources who said there was 'cautious progress' in the hostage deal. A Hamas source told the Qatari news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the proposal was complete and required only Netanyahu's approval. Although previously Hamas had demanded a full IDF withdrawal from Gaza before hostages could be released, the current agreement has allowed Israel's military to remain in Gaza, including the Philadelphi corridor, until the last day of the plan. Hamas and Egypt have reportedly agreed to postpone the discussion of several issues until later phases of the agreement. The source told Channel 13 that negotiators were 'at the closest point [yet] to completing the agreement.' Netanyahu had previously insisted that he would not accept a proposal that would force Israel to end the war in Gaza; the current deal on the table requires the IDF to leave the Philadelphi corridor in the final phase. Arab media reports that Hamas will soon provide a list of living hostages that it is prepared to release. Foreign sources note that Israel has made significant concessions, including withdrawing a number of troops in the initial 'humanitarian' phase of the deal. al-Araby al-Jadeed reports that this is the 'closest' the two sides have gotten to a hostage release agreement.

Assad refused Iran’s plea to attack Israel after Oct. 7	The Syrian dictator refused, citing strained relations with the Islamic Republic. By Jewish Breaking News Syria’s Bashar al-Assad rebuffed multiple Iranian requests to attack a vulnerable Israel in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7 massacre. Under Assad’s rule, Syria had served as Iran’s regional terror hub, having facilitated weapons transfers to terror proxy groups like Hezbollah and Hamas for decades. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) also controlled airports, and warehouses, and operated missile and drone manufacturing bases in Syria. However, a leaked recording of a speech given by IRGC Behrouz Esbati at a mosque in Tehran last week reveals that Assad had been presented with comprehensive military plans to leverage Iranian assets in Syria for strikes against Israel. But in spite of his thirst for innocent blood, the Syrian dictator refused, citing strained relations with the Islamic Republic. 'I don’t consider losing Syria something to be proud of,' Esbati said in the recording obtained by the New York Times. 'We were defeated, and defeated very badly, we took a very big blow and it’s been very difficult.' Serving as an IRCG commander in Syria, Esbati also accused ally Russia of actively undermining operations in the war-torn country. According to his account, Russian forces deliberately misled Iran by claiming to bomb Syrian rebel positions while actually dropping ordnance on empty fields. More damaging still, he alleged that Russia had turned off Tehran’s alert radars during Israel’s retaliatory strikes in October. While Esbati outlined plans to maintain influence through insurgent networks in post-Assad Syria, experts question the regime’s ability to effectively operate given the new political landscape and Israeli warnings of swift retaliation against any detected Iranian presence. Yet perhaps most revealing was his frank confession about future strikes against Israel. Dropping the usual bravado that typically characterizes Iranian official statements, Esbati admitted that there were 'operational limitations' and pointed to last fall’s missile barrage against Israel as the IRGC’s sole response for the time being.

Houthis paying ‘heavy price,’ Netanyahu says after Israeli strike...	The Israeli military said that 'military infrastructure sites' in the Hizaz power station were among the targets it struck. By JNS Israeli fighter jets hit Houthi terror targets on Yemen’s western coast and inland in the country on Friday, the Israel Defense Forces stated. 'The Houthi terrorist regime has repeatedly attacked the State of Israel, its citizens and civilian infrastructure in Israel,' including using drones and surface-to-surface missiles, the Israeli military stated. 'The State of Israel has the right and obligation to defend itself.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated on Friday afternoon that 'just as we promised, the Houthis are paying, and will continue to pay, a heavy price for their aggression against us,' according to an English translation of his remarks provided by his office. 'Today, we attacked terrorist targets of the Houthi terrorist regime along the western coastal strip and deep in Yemen. The Houthis are a proxy of Iran, and they serve the terrorist objectives of the Iranian axis in the Middle East,' he stated. 'They constitute a danger to Israel and the entire region, including global freedom of navigation.' The Israeli prime minister added that the Jewish state won’t abide attacks on the country and its citizens. 'We will take determined and forceful action against anyone who threatens the State of Israel wherever and whenever necessary,' Netanyahu stated. The Israeli military said that 'military infrastructure sites' in the Hizaz power station were among the targets it struck. That site 'serves as a central source of energy for the Houthi terrorist regime in its military activities,' the IDF stated. Israel also hit 'military infrastructure' in the ports of Al Hudaydah and Ras Isa on Yemen’s western coast. 'The targets struck are examples of the Houthis’ exploitation of civilian infrastructure for its terrorist activities,' the IDF said. The Israeli military stated that Houthi 'attacks on international shipping vessels and routes continue to destabilize the region and the wider world.' 'While the Houthi terrorist regime operates as an independent terrorist organization, it relies on Iranian cooperation and funding to attack the State of Israel and its citizens,' it added. 'The IDF will continue to operate at any distance against any threat to the State of Israel and its citizens.' On Jan. 8, U.S. Central Command stated that its forces hit 'two Iranian-backed Houthi underground advanced conventional weapon storage facilities within Houthi-controlled territories of Yemen.' 'The Houthis used these facilities to conduct attacks against U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,' CENTCOM stated, noting no U.S. troops were hurt nor equipment damaged. 'The strikes are part of CENTCOM’s effort to degrade Iranian-backed Houthi attempts to threaten regional partners and military and merchant vessels in the region,' it added. Also on Wednesday, Israeli air-defense systems shot down three Houthi drones launched from Yemen. Since Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Houthis have launched about 40 ballistic missiles and about 320 drones at the Jewish state, per the Israeli military.

Foreign sources note that Israel has made significant concessions, including withdrawing a number of troops in the initial 'humanitarian' phase of the deal. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Qatari-owned news outlet al-Araby al-Jadeed reports that a framework for a hostage release deal has been completed, and Israel has agreed to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor in the final phase. The mediators are awaiting approval from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The hostage release deal will include three phases, and Israel will gradually withdraw troops from Gaza beginning in the first phase until it leaves the Philadelphi corridor on the last day of the agreement. Al Araby notes a 'clear shift' in Netanyahu's position regarding 'the process of completing the war after the first stage [of a ceasefire deal].' Arab media reports that Hamas will soon provide a list of living hostages that it is prepared to release. Foreign sources note that Israel has made significant concessions, including withdrawing a number of troops in the initial 'humanitarian' phase of the deal. al-Araby al-Jadeed reports that this is the 'closest' the two sides have gotten to a hostage release agreement.

Forged in fire: Gaza war showcases women’s integration into the I...	More than a year of war has opened new opportunities for female soldiers across a wide range of fields and units. By Amelie Botbol, JNS 'It’s amazing how, in this war, you see female doctors, paramedics and pilots. You hear them on the radio and you see them on the ground. Gradually the barrier was broken,' Lt. Col. Shani Kisri, medical chief of the Israel Defense Forces’ 162nd Division, told JNS on Friday. The integration of women into front-line positions, Kisri said, started approximately in the beginning of the ’90s. By 1996, there were female paramedics embedded in various battalions, with the Golani Brigade being the pioneer. After her return to service in 2010 after graduating from medical school, Kisri became the first-ever battalion doctor for an Israeli infantry brigade. During 2014’s 'Operation Protective Edge,' Kisri noted, she was likely the only female doctor in the Gaza Strip.

'I was in a special unit back then. The female paramedics were less present on the battlefield. Now you see them everywhere. There are more female pilots, paramedics, doctors and females in special operations units. This war gave us a chance to prove that it works,' she said. 'They proved they can do the job, handle the rough conditions and the long fighting period. ‘Protective Edge’ was a few weeks and it was hard. This war has lasted over a year now. I have paramedics who have been in the field for months. It’s not easy and they handled it perfectly,' she added. 'Gradually we will see that more and more females are integrated into more battlefield positions because at the end of the day, the army needs good people with motivation to serve and whether it’s a male or female, today, we know it doesn’t really matter,' she told JNS. IDF Armored Corps soldiers at a staging area near the Gaza Strip on Jan. 1, 2024. Photo by Tomer Neuberg/Flash90. There are a few difficulties, Kisri noted, especially for female medical corps soldiers. 'Usually, you’re the only female around, especially if you’re a doctor or paramedic at the platoon level. You might be the only female among a few dozens of men,' she said. 'You might find yourself, especially in this war, serving for weeks on the battlefield with no interactions with other females, no private quarters, no showers and everything that comes with joint service,' she continued. Still, 'I think we are getting better at understanding the difficulties and supporting the female paramedics and doctors,' she said. 'They are very highly motivated, very qualified and there is a big demand for female doctors and paramedics in the battalions now. So it’s working.'

The reason for females often finding themselves alone in a battalion is that they have not yet been integrated into the infantry the way they have been into the medical corps, she said. 'The medical corps is more progressive in this aspect. When the medical corps puts a paramedic in a position, it does not take into account whether the person is male or female, it’s based on experience and qualifications,' she said. 'Being a medical corps personnel in a battalion, coming from a different place, can feel a bit isolating compared to soldiers who went through the entire service together. You have to find your place. Most paramedics integrate quite well,' she continued. The IAF’s five new women UAV operators, Dec. 9, 2020. Credit: IDF Spokesperson’s Unit. 'They get a lot of respect, they tell everybody what to do, they are very assertive and the soldiers take care of them. It’s not easy in battlefield conditions, but the male and female soldiers find solutions,' she added. Kisri told JNS she has more than 40 paramedics in her division and does find women to have more issues than men. 'You sometimes see a paramedic, she is half the size of most of the male soldiers, carrying a bag twice her bodyweight. She won’t stop because she wants to prove that she can do it so that nobody says she can’t because she is a female or because she’s a paramedic,' she said.

'This motivation is highly appreciated by the male soldiers, who usually trust the trial by fire. Once you’ve proven yourself to be equipped to carry your gear and especially once you take care of the first wounded soldiers and have to perform under battlefield conditions, even the most skeptical are convinced,' she added. With regard to the hostages kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, Kisri said the big difference wasn’t between female and male soldiers but rather between soldiers and civilians. 'When you’re a soldier, you go into the army knowing what you’re getting yourself into and the risks you are willing to take, as a male or a female. I don’t think society should tell women that because of their gender the risk is higher. If somebody is willing to take the risk it’s their decision,' she said. Soldiers from the IDF’s 99th Division during operational activities in the central Gaza Strip in an undated photo from November or December, 2024. Credit: IDF. Ensuring that women are treated as equals, Kisri said, falls under the responsibility of the commander, who monitors that the right values are upheld and that soldiers behave in an appropriate manner. 'I do have a lot of females in the field, and I see it as my personal responsibility to make sure that my paramedics and doctors are treated with respect and appropriately. I don’t have many examples to give you of bad incidents,' she said. 'We talk to commanders about it. We don’t just wait for something to happen, we create boundaries, specific orders and rules and enforce them strictly,' she added. While 86% of units in the army are open to women, Kisri said the number of women within these units is also increasing. When she was in the field, 'We were maybe three female doctors in infantry battalions,' she said. 'Today it’s more than 50%. It’s not only about the type of positions that are open, it’s also about the number of women that fill those positions,' she said. 'If you open your mind to the female soldiers, you’ll do so with other minorities. There were other minorities being integrated even before females. Everything is intertwined,' she said. 'I think the army is one of the most progressive places. Sometimes Israeli society should aspire to be more like the army,' she added.

Defense Minister Katz demands IDF present plan to destroy Hamas i...	The Defense Minister added that considerations of post-war governance in Gaza were irrelevant with Hamas still standing. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During a high-level security meeting, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz urged the IDF to draft a plan to completely destroy Hamas if the hostages are not released by the time Donald Trump takes office as US President. Also attending the meeting were IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and senior military commanders. Katz also cautioned the IDF to consider what issues may create obstacles, such as the humanitarian aspect and encouraged them to make the plan flexible enough to allow the political echelon to make necessary decisions. The Defense Minister added that considerations of post-war governance in Gaza were irrelevant with Hamas still standing, since no nation or group, whether Arab or not, is interested in taking responsibility for running Gaza while the terror group still has a strong presence there. Katz said a plan that signaled a change of direction and decisive action against Hamas was needed to avoid the conflict from becoming a quagmire and a war of attrition with no progress on the release of hostages. Katz said, 'We must not let ourselves be dragged into a drawn-out war of attrition while hostages remain trapped in Hamas tunnels, their lives at risk and suffering greatly.' He added, 'The commanders and soldiers of the IDF, both active and reserve, are performing heroically and achieving remarkable success. However, alongside these efforts, we must adjust our strategy to ensure the elimination of Hamas and bring the war to an end. We cannot afford to be drawn into a costly war of attrition that would prevent us from achieving a decisive victory—one that delivers a total strategic defeat of Hamas and brings the conflict in Gaza to a close.' The plan focused on a total defeat of Hamas is likely to be focused in part on destroying the terror group's military capabilities and infrastructure in Nuseirat and Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where many of the hostages are held. One of the reasons the IDF has held back is the fear of harming hostages during these operations.

Nearly half of college students sympathize more with accused murd...	The Generation Lab findings highlight a sharp divide in attitudes toward the gunning-down of Thompson, with younger individuals more likely to view it favorably and sympathize with Mangione. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Nearly half of college students in America view the accused murderer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson favorably, while more than 8 in 10 hold a negative opinion of Thompson, according to a new Generation Lab poll. When asked to choose between the two, 45 percent of students said they side with accused killer Luigi Mangione, 17 percent with Thompson, and 37 percent with neither, the poll found. Forty-eight percent said they believe the murder was totally or somewhat justified, and 81 percent reported having an extremely or somewhat negative view of the victim. Mangione, 26, is accused of murdering the UnitedHealthcare CEO outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel on December 4. He has pleaded not guilty to murder and other state charges. He is also facing federal charges, including stalking and using a firearm to commit murder, with the death penalty on the table. The Generation Lab findings highlight a sharp divide in attitudes toward the gunning-down of Thompson, with younger individuals more likely to view it favorably and sympathize with Mangione. A similar trend appeared in an Emerson poll last month, in which 41 percent of voters under 30 described the killing as 'acceptable,' far more than any other age group. Social media users, meanwhile, have lionized the accused murderer, with Axios reporting that 'the Internet' is cheering him as a 'folk hero.' Mangione is scheduled to make his next court appearance on February 17.

Fake news and psychological warfare: ‘An unbelievable success of ...	We’ve learned with the time to filter the messages and not to believe anything that Hamas, or whoever, says, until there is an official confirmation,' said Talik Gvili, whose son's body is being held in Gaza. By Pesach Benson and Anna Epshtein, TPS Monday’s headlines claimed Hamas had approved a list of 34 Israeli hostages to be released in a potential ceasefire agreement, raising both hopes of a breakthrough and fears that some hostages would be condemned to possibly never return. The following day, Israeli officials said they never received such a list from Hamas. 'The report in the Arab media about a pause of a number of weeks in the war in exchange for a list of hostages’ names is absolutely false and an additional part of the psychological warfare that Hamas is trying to use on the hostages’ families and the citizens of Israel,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. Relatives of the captives told The Press Service of Israel that Hamas’s fake news and hostage videos take a toll. Learning to ‘Filter the Messages’ 'We’ve learned with the time to filter the messages and not to believe anything that Hamas, or whoever, says, until there is an official confirmation,' said Talik Gvili. Her son, Police Sgt. First Class Ran Gvili, 24, was killed in the area of Kibbutz Alumim on October 7 and his body taken to Gaza. 'I can’t say it doesn’t shake us at all, it does. But we understand it’s psychological warfare against us, and we try to keep calm. It’s a pity to see that the media help Hamas with their goal and print all kinds of rumors before they are confirmed,' she said. The psychological warfare has taken a particular toll on the Bibas family. Terrorists kidnapped Yarden Bibas, his wife Shiri, and their children, Ariel, then four, and Kfir, then seven months, the youngest hostage. Shiri and the children were supposed to be released along with 105 other women and children during the temporary ceasefire of November 2023. On November 29, Hamas claimed the three had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. But the terror group provided no evidence. Israel accused Hamas of psychological warfare and said the terror group was responsible for the safety of the hostages. 'It’s really hard for us when another half-true or entirely false report about the possible deal gets out, and then we are bombarded with questions, and it’s not pleasant in any situation, but especially in a one like this,' Eylon Keshet, a cousin of the Israeli-Argentine/Peruvian Yarden Bibas told TPS-IL. 'It doesn’t really give us hope, rather it confuses us. And it hurts us to think about the families that are not on the list. How should they feel?! We know that when there is anything true people from the army get in touch with us. Last time, it was several months ago when they let us know about a sign of life from Yarden.' Keshet added, 'We want to really ask the media and the public not to take part in this psychological warfare of Hamas and not to publish unconfirmed information.' ‘An Unbelievable Success of Hamas’ Dr. Ron Schleifer, who teaches communications at Ariel University, told TPS-IL, 'Everything that comes out of Hamas’s mouth in the context of the hostages should be treated through the lens of a psychological war. Every video clip, every message.' According to Schleifer, a hostage deal is not a means but a goal for Hamas. 'They understand they are defeated in the field, so they go to psychological warfare. They act according to the plan. The hostages are the second stage, the first was the rapes and murders of the October 7 that were meant to shock the Israelis and successfully managed to do so. The second step is a long war. The goal is to exhaust the Israelis.' Schleifer explained that Hamas sought to 'give hope and then blow it up' with Sunday’s hostage list. 'When you build up the hopes and then blow them up, it’s a much bigger breakdown. It influences the families, and then friends, and then the media, and then the security system and eventually the political system,' he said. 'It’s an unbelievable success of Hamas that they managed to shift the blame for the hostages still in Gaza to the Israeli government and made people forget that Hamas kidnapped them to Gaza, not Netanyahu,' Schleifer added. Asked how Israel could counter Hamas’s psychological warfare, Schleifer said Israel need only return the blame to Hamas. 'And we don’t do this. We have so much intelligence from Hamas members that we have arrested during this war about the tortures of Hamas against Gazans, not Israelis,' Schleifer insisted. 'Israel must use the Gazan’s disappointment against Hamas, must lead it. And Hamas should always be afraid. Hamas members surrender each day, we just do not speak about this in the media enough.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 96 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Domestic defense contracts a major step in Israeli self-sufficien...	Defense officials have stated in recent months that achieving a higher level of defense production autonomy allows Israel to choose its partnerships and take part in valuable strategic alliances—especially with Washington—from a position of strength, rather than dependency. By Yaakov Lappin, JNS The Israeli Defense Ministry’s announcement on Jan. 7 of two major contracts with Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems, valued jointly at approximately NIS 1 billion, constitutes one of the strongest signals yet that Israel is decreasing its reliance on defense imports wherever it can. The agreements, signed by Defense Ministry Director General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and Elbit Systems President & CEO Bezhalel ('Butzi') Machlis, are aimed at leveraging domestic Israeli industry to boost the IDF’s operational independence and force buildup capabilities. This strategic initiative marks a critical shift as part of Israel’s Blue and White Independence Program, which seeks to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers while boosting local manufacturing capabilities, according to a Defense Ministry statement. The first agreement, led by the Defense Procurement Directorate (DPD), involves the production of thousands of heavy air munitions for the IDF. The second agreement, overseen by the Planning Department and the Directorate of Defense Research & Development (DDR&D), entails the establishment of a national raw materials plant. This facility will feature advanced production lines for materials critical to the manufacturing of weapons, which were previously sourced primarily from abroad. According to Zamir, these agreements will ensure an Israeli sovereign ability to make bombs and munitions 'of all types,' adding, 'This is a central lesson from the war that will enable the IDF to continue operating powerfully in all theaters.' The Nagel Commission report The necessity for domestic production was also highlighted by the Nagel Commission, which was set up to examine how the IDF could better build up its forces after the Oct. 7 mass terror attack. The commission, headed by the former head of Israel’s National Security Council Brig. Gen. Prof. Jacob Nagel, submitted a report to the government on Jan. 6 highlighting the vulnerabilities exposed during the current conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah, including heavy reliance on imports for critical defense materials. The report stated: 'The war significantly challenged many long-held assumptions regarding dependence on imports (mainly from the United States, but not only). [Munition] consumption rates outpaced local production, and imports (of both products and raw material) couldn’t keep up for a range of reasons, mainly: the global arms race (especially the Russia-Ukraine war) and a higher bar for exports to Israel, due to political decisions, public pressure, and the interests of [international] decision-makers.' The report elsewhere noted that incidents 'like an embargo, a shortage in various types of weapons (especially land and air munitions), and fierce global competition over every available resource' mean Israel must become more independent when it comes to arms. The report recommended an aggressive push for self-reliance in defense manufacturing, emphasizing hybrid strategies to maintain rapid access to critical munitions and raw materials. It called for the creation of a robust Israeli Defense Industrial Base (DIB) that integrates both civilian and military manufacturing capabilities. An old-new approach Israel’s pivot toward domestic defense production is not a new concept. Historically, the country began focusing on self-sufficiency after France’s 1967 arms embargo. However, the scale and urgency of the current shift are unprecedented, driven by global uncertainties and heightened Israeli military demands on multiple fronts. Defense officials have stated in recent months that achieving a higher level of defense production autonomy allows Israel to choose its partnerships and take part in valuable strategic alliances—especially with Washington—from a position of strength, rather than dependency. The Blue and White Independence Program was initiated in the fallout of the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks, when Israel found itself needing to receive hundreds of American cargo aircraft carrying ammunition, as well as resupply ships. Alongside a focus on manufacturing, the program also prioritizes research and development of dual-purpose technologies that benefit both civilian and military applications. Examples include advanced laser systems like Rafael’s Iron Beam and quantum technologies for secure communications and rapid intelligence processing. Challenges and benefits The agreements with Elbit Systems are expected to provide highly significant operational benefits to the IDF. For example, the heavy air munitions deal will enhance Israel’s ability to sustain operations across multiple theaters, such as in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as to deal with threats from Iran. Meanwhile, the new raw materials plant will reduce vulnerabilities in the supply chain, ensuring a steady flow of critical components. However, challenges remain. Israel’s dependence on U.S. Foreign Military Financing (FMF) casts a shadow on broader self-sufficiency, as FMF funds must be spent on American-made equipment. Additionally, scaling up domestic production requires significant government investments in infrastructure, automation and workforce training. The agreements also have broader implications for Israel’s economy. By expanding local production lines and fostering innovation, the defense sector will create jobs and stimulate economic growth. Machlis, Elbit’s president, noted this during the Jan. 7 signing with the Defense Ministry, stating, 'This partnership contributes not only to security, but also to economic development and employment, creating livelihoods for thousands of households in Israel.' At least one lesson from the past year and a half of war appears to have resulted in consensus among the Israeli defense establishment: Israel can never again afford to have only a small stockpile of weapons at its disposal, at any time.

Israel confirms Hamza Ziyadne killed in Hamas captivity	The remains of Ziyadne and his father, Youssef, were recovered by the IDF from a tunnel in Rafah, southern Gaza. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) confirmed on Friday morning that Israeli civilian Hamza Ziyadne, 22, was killed in Hamas captivity. His family was notified following the identification process by National Institute of Forensic Medicine and the Israel Police. The IDF recovered the remains of Ziyadne and his father, Youssef, 53, from a tunnel in Rafah, southern Gaza, on Tuesday night. The IDF and Shin Bet confirmed on Wednesday that Youssef’s remains were found. The statement did not immediately confirm Hamza’s death, though it said that the findings in the tunnel raised 'serious concerns' for his life. They were taken hostage alive during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, along with two of Youssef’s other children, Bilal, 18, and Aisha, 17. Palestinian terrorists abducted the residents of the Israeli Bedouin community of Rahat while they were working in Kibbutz Holit near the border with Gaza. Bilal and Aisha were released as part of the November 2023 ceasefire agreement between Jerusalem and Hamas after 55 days in captivity. On Oct. 7, 2023, some 25 residents of Rahat, the largest Muslim Bedouin city in Israel, headed to Gaza border Kibbutzim Holit and Sufa to work and did not return. They were among some 1,200 people killed by terrorists during the invasion of of the northwestern Negev. Thousands more were wounded, and 251 were taken back to the Strip as hostages, including six Bedouin. According to Israeli estimates, there are 98 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 94 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 157 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 36 bodies, 34 of them taken on Oct. 7 and the remaining two being IDF soldiers Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul, who were kidnapped in 2014. 'The IDF and Shin Bet send their heartfelt condolences to the families,' the statement said, adding that they are 'continuing to operate in order to bring home all the hostages as soon as possible.'

Netanyahu calls meeting to discuss possible third Iran strike	Israeli support for a harsh response against Iran cuts across political lines. By David Isaac, JNS Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a discussion on Thursday to evaluate the Israeli military’s preparedness for the possibility of a third attack on Iran. Also on the agenda: a more aggressive U.S. policy expected from the incoming Trump administration regarding Iran. Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, after a Nov. 10 meeting with Donald Trump, reportedly left with the impression that the president-elect would support an Israeli Air Force strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, or possibly send in a U.S. strike, according to news site Axios, citing unnamed sources. On Tuesday, Trump, replying to a question from reporters about a U.S. strike on Iran, said, 'It’s a military strategy and I’m not answering a question on our military strategy. Only a stupid person would answer.' Iran fears a direct Israeli attack against its strategic sites in the near future, having interpreted Israel’s ceasefire with Hezbollah as intended to free up IDF assets to concentrate on the Islamic Republic directly, Channel 12 reported on Dec. 22. It is not clear whether Iran’s weakened position after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria will push it into diplomatic talks to de-escalate matters or drive it to pursue a nuclear bomb with greater energy, as the country’s leaders have sent mixed messages. Ali Abdolalizadeh, an aid to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Dec. 31, 'We must negotiate with Mr. Trump. The country’s issues cannot be left unresolved, and the entire establishment has also reached the conclusion that direct negotiations are necessary,' Iran International reported. However, others in the Islamic Republic are calling to ramp up its nuclear program. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan warned on Dec. 22 that voices in Iran are saying publicly that it should construct a nuclear bomb. 'If you’re Iran right now and you’re looking around at the fact that your conventional capability has been reduced, your proxies have been reduced, your main client state has been eliminated, Assad has fallen, it’s no wonder there are voices saying: ‘Hey, maybe we need to go for a nuclear weapon right now,’' Sullivan told reporters. In Israel, senior officials have called to again attack Iran. On Dec. 22, Ynet reported that Mossad Director David Barnea advocated for such a strike in response to attacks on Israel by the Houthis, a Yemen-based proxy of Tehran. 'Go for the head, Iran,' Barnea argued, officials said. Israeli support for a harsh response against Iran cuts across political lines. Benny Gantz, leader of the opposition National Unity Party, told JNS on Dec. 23 that Israel should take 'all the necessary means' to defend itself against the Iranian threat. Israel struck Iran twice last year, on Oct. 26 and April 19, both times in retaliation for Iranian attacks. Iran’s initial attack on April 13 marked the first time the Islamic Republic had struck Israeli territory directly. Israel’s second attack was more devastating than the first in April. It targeted 20 sites in Iran in multiple waves, destroying Iran’s remaining Russian-built, S-300 surface-to-air missile defense systems. Israel’s strikes left Iran vulnerable to future attacks, Fox News reported at the time, quoting Biden administration adviser Amos Hochstein, who said, 'Iran is essentially naked.' Analysts told JNS last month that Iran’s Islamic dictatorship is ripe for regime change and an Israeli military strike could help push it over the edge. 'This is a golden opportunity,' Janatan Sayeh, a research analyst with the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told JNS, outlining the possibility of a one-two punch, with the U.S. imposing economic sanctions and Israel delivering military blows.

Government presents softened judicial reform plan	The proposal seeks reforms to the way judges are appointed and Basic Laws function. By JNS Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar presented a pared-down judicial reform proposal on Thursday, reaction to which generally adhered to party lines. Their proposal addresses two issues: 1) the way judges are selected, and 2) Basic Laws, which are quasi-constitutional in nature. The proposal would not go into effect until after a national election is held. Coalition members generally praised the Sa’ar-Levin initiative. By finding agreement with Sa’ar, who brought four additional Knesset seats into the coalition when he joined the government in September, Levin sought to assure the deal would have full coalition support—68 Knesset seats out of 120. MK Boaz Bismuth of the Likud Party said, 'I congratulate Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on the draft proposal they presented, which brings true good news to the people of Israel.' 'This is an important step toward strengthening the Israeli state and society in the midst of a period of war, when the unity of the people is the key to victory.' 'Even a journey of a thousand miles begins with a small step,' tweeted Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich of the Religious Zionism Party. 'I welcome any progress that will repair and rebuild public trust in the justice system, even if it is a first step. Broad national consensus is important for the unity and strength of the people and justifies compromises,' he said. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir of the Otzma Yehudit Party echoed the sentiment, saying, 'Reform with broad consensus is the right compromise, even when it is not perfect, and therefore I support the draft proposal and the change is welcome.' Opposition parties, on the other hand, expressed disapproval. Opposition leader Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid Party dismissed the plan, tweeting, 'I will respond to Yariv Levin immediately after he complies with the court order and appoints a president of the High Court of Justice by January 16.' Lapid referred to the court’s order that Levin convene the Judicial Selection Committee and enable it to appoint a president of the Supreme Court. Levin had held up the convening of the committee as he opposed the candidacy of the acting court president, Justice Isaac Amit, who is known for his judicial activism. (As part of the compromise proposal, Levin will remove his opposition to Amit.) Yisrael Beytenu Party head MK Avigdor Liberman treated the outline as at best a partial fix. 'The only solution to the constitutional crisis is the establishment of a constitution for the State of Israel. Everything else is just patch upon patch.' Yair Golan, chairman of the far-left The Democrats, a merger of the Meretz and Labor parties, said his party would not discuss or agree to any proposal until all legislation put forward by the coalition is halted, 'including the attempt to take over the media, the Bar Association, the dismissal of the attorney general, the subordination of the DIP [Department of Internal Police Investigations] to the minister of justice, etc.' The head of the Israel Bar Association, Amit Becher, sharply criticized the deal, calling it a 'deceptive and dangerous proposal for the implementation of the principles of the coup d’état, the main one of which is politicizing the election of Supreme Court justices and increasing the government’s power over the judiciary.' The proposal’s main innovation is to replace the two representatives of the Israel Bar Association on the nine-member Judicial Selection Committee with two attorneys selected by the Knesset—one by the opposition and one by the coalition. Following media inquiries, the judiciary said it could not comment 'for obvious reasons.' At least one exception to the opposition’s rejection was MK Matan Kahana, a member of Benny Gantz’s National Unity Party, who declared his willingness to support the agreement. 'If this is the deal, it does seem like a good proposal around which a broad consensus can be formed,' Kahana said. 'All this on the condition that the minister of justice upholds the High Court’s ruling and appoints a permanent president before next Thursday.' The deal seeks to end the Supreme Court’s control over the selection of judges, one of the main planks of judicial reform, which was derailed by year-long protests in 2023. In the current framework, the Judicial Selection Committee is made up of three Supreme Court judges, two government ministers, two Knesset members and two lawyers from the Israel Bar Association. As seven of the nine members are needed to approve a candidate, and the three judges vote as a bloc, they have veto power over nominees. Given that the Bar Association lawyers typically vote with the judges (because they don’t want to anger the judges who will hear their cases, critics say), the judges also end up with a majority. Supporters of judicial reform argue that the judges’ majority leads to homogeneity—judges who think alike. In addition, the proposal will establish principles for Basic Laws, determining how they are enacted and what topics they can cover, including issues related to national identity and human rights. The proposal also limits judicial review of Basic Laws, requiring a special majority of Supreme Court judges to override them, and includes the passing of a new Basic Law enshrining civil rights in criminal procedures.

Bernie Sanders receives a vote for president of Lebanon as army c...	Vermont senator receives a vote for president in Lebanon's parliament, as Joseph Aoun elected following two year deadlock. By Ben Sales, JTA Lebanon has elected a new president after two years of political indecision, but not before some unexpected characters received votes — including Sen. Bernie Sanders, an American Jew. Lebanon’s president is elected by the parliament for a six-year term and, under the country’s system, must be a Maronite Christian. The eventual victor was the country’s military chief, Joseph Aoun, whose win on Thursday ended two years of political crisis in which 12 successive votes failed to reach the requisite majority. The vote also took place less than two months into the ceasefire that ended a devastating war between Israel and the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah. But on the road to Aoun’s triumph in the second round of voting, some lawmakers cast protest votes. At one point, according to video shared by Al Jazeera English’s news editor, Saad Abedine, a legislator put in a vote for Sanders, the 83-year-old Vermont independent who is the unofficial dean of progressives on Capitol Hill. Sanders won another term in the Senate last November but, for multiple reasons, is ineligible to lead Lebanon. The video shows multiple men in the parliamentary chamber saying Sanders’ name, followed moments later by a loudspeaker enunciating 'Bernie Sanders!' across the room. The next vote appears to be for Aoun. Aoun (no relation to the previous president, Michel Aoun) has led Lebanon’s military since 2017. His victory is a sign of Hezbollah’s weakness, according to The New York Times, after the terror group was heavily battered in its war with Israel. Hezbollah, which also has a political arm, had blocked previous attempts to elect a president. This time, its candidate dropped out. In his remarks after his election, Aoun drew applause for saying the state would be the only force to carry weapons, a reference to an agreement that the Lebanese military would reassert control of southern Lebanon, which had been controlled by Hezbollah. He also vowed that Israel would withdraw its remaining troops from Lebanon, as it is slated to do, and said, 'My pledge is to rebuild what Israel destroyed.'

Bill sanctioning ICC over Netanyahu arrest warrant passes in US H...	The US Senate, now controlled by the GOP, will take up the Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act, after it passed 243-140 in the House of Representatives. By World Israel News Staff The United States House of Representatives voted Thursday in favor of a measure protesting the International Criminal Court over the arrest warrants it issued by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan last November against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ex-Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud). The lower chamber of Congress voted 243 to 140, with 198 Republicans joined by 45 Democrats backing the Republican-sponsored bill, to pass the measure, which will now go to the Senate. The bill was reintroduced this week, after the House passed a similar piece of legislation last summer. However, the Senate, then featuring a Democratic majority and led by New York Democrat Chuck Schumer, did not bring the measure up for a vote before the end of the session. Dubbed the 'Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act,' the bill would impose sanctions on any non-citizen who investigates, arrests, detains, or prosecutes an American citizen or citizens of an allied country - such as Israel - which is not a party to the Rome Statute and are therefore not under the ICC's jurisdiction. The sanctions ICC officials face include being refused visas to the United States, the loss of existing visas, and barring of property transactions in the U.S. Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has vowed to pass the bill later this month, sending it to President-elect Donald Trump's desk for signing shortly after his inauguration on January 20th. However, Senate Republicans, who now hold 53-seats in the 100-member chamber, will need the acquiescence of at least 7 Democrats to ward off a potential filibuster and ensure the law's passage. The Coalition for Jewish Values, an alliance of over 2,500 Orthodox Jewish rabbis in the United States, lauded the House's vote Thursday. 'The ICC’s abhorrent equivalence between the genocidal terrorists of Hamas, and Jewish leaders working to end the explicit threat of another Holocaust, can only be seen as antisemitic bigotry,' said CJV President Rabbi Yoel Schonfeld. 'It negates trust in international legal institutions and undermines efforts to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East. To sanction the members of the ICC for their conduct is a moral imperative, and we commend all those working to pass this important legislation.'

Biden blasts Hamas for blocking hostage deal	President Biden optimistic hostage deal can be reached amid 'real progress,' while blaming Hamas for lack of a breakthrough, saying the terror group is 'getting in the way' of an agreement. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden expressed optimism a breakthrough could be in the offing in hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar, even as he slammed the Hamas terror organization for stymying efforts to reach an agreement to secure a Gaza ceasefire and the release of the nearly 100 hostages held in the Gaza Strip. Speaking out during a press conference Thursday focused primarily on the federal government's response to the ongoing firestorm in Los Angeles County, Biden said that there had been some 'real progress' lately in hostage deal talks. 'We’re making some real progress,' Biden told reporters, saying he had spoken earlier that day with American mediators involved in the talks. 'I met with negotiators today,' Biden added. 'I think we’re seeing some progress.' 'I know hope springs eternal, but I’m still hopeful that we’ll be able to have a prisoner exchange.' Biden blamed Hamas for the failure thus far to reach an agreement, but nevertheless hinted that the terror group might be willing to compromise. 'Hamas is the one getting in the way of that exchange, right now, but I think we may be able to get that done. We need to get it done.' A day earlier, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the two sides were 'very close' to a ceasefire, while adding that a final agreement may not be reached until President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20th. 'In the Middle East, we're very close to a ceasefire and hostage agreement,' Blinken said Wednesday. 'I hope that we can get it over the line in the time that we have left. But if we don't, then the plan that President Biden put forward for a ceasefire/hostage deal will be handed over to the incoming administration. And I believe that when we get that deal - and we'll get it - it will be on the basis of the plan that President Biden put before the world back in May.'

Pasadena synagogue burns down as fires rage across Southern Calif...	I feel numb to this. It’s like a bad, bad horrific dream. To see that it’s not going to be here tomorrow,' said a former congregant. By Philissa Cramer, JTA A synagogue with more than 100 years of history in Pasadena, California, burned down overnight as fires swept across parts of Southern California. The fate of a Chabad center about 40 miles away near the coast was unclear as a major fire flared in the Pacific Palisades, one of three different blazes destroying structures and threatening lives in multiple pockets of the greater Los Angeles area. Additional Jewish institutions lay in evacuation zones, while others took preparations in case of further spread. The Pasadena Jewish Center and Temple burned for hours as fire spilled out of the Eaton Canyon, fueled by strong winds. The 434-family congregation had operated from the Mission-style building, which had a wooden Torah ark carved by the Jewish artist Peter Krasnow, and three outbuildings since the 1940s. 'It’s a massive center, it’s just crumbling with the intensity of the heat,' a KTLA reporter said while broadcasting from the scene. She added, as flames shot through the synagogue’s roof, 'It looks like the concrete and the metal is just melting. … It’s just a total loss.' Added a neighborhood man whom the newscaster said used to go to the synagogue, 'I feel numb to this. It’s like a bad bad horrific dream. To see that it’s not going to be here tomorrow … ' His voice broke. The newscaster, Tracy Leong, showed fire trucks driving past the synagogue but said she had not seen any attempt to quell its burning while she was on the scene. 'It’s really hard to get a handle on this fire,' she said. 'There are so many structures burning and they’re doing what they can, and there’s just not enough of them right now.' The congregation’s executive director told The New York Times overnight that everyone employed by the synagogue was safe. 'We are devastated, but our staff are safe and we managed to get our Torahs out safely as well, while ash was coming down in our parking lot,' said Melissa Levy, who said she had been evacuated from her own home. Southern California has long been vulnerable to devastating fires, but climate change has altered weather patterns that in the past largely limited fire season to only parts of the year. Earlier in the night, the Pasadena fire was not the major one on the radar for residents of the region. A larger fire in the Pacific Palisades, located on the Pacific coast north of Santa Monica, was under an evacuation order as strong winds spread a fire there. A third fire later erupted several miles north. Zibby Owens, the publisher and bookseller who recently put out an anthology titled 'On Being Jewish Now,' posted footage on Instagram showing that her family’s home in the area had been lapped by flames before losing its camera feed. Kehillat Israel, a Reconstructionist synagogue in Pacific Palisades, was also under an evacuation order and closed starting on Tuesday. And the Chabad of Pacific Palisades evacuated 100 children from its preschool on Tuesday as fire neared the property, Rabbi Zushe Cunin told local TV news. He and other rabbis posed with the community’s Torahs as they removed them from the fire’s path on Tuesday evening. 'The night is still a very long one, and the winds are still raging,' the center said on Instagram. 'We need all of your prayers to overcome this dangerous fire.' The center is located squarely inside the evacuation zone for the Palisades Fire. None of the three fires was contained on Wednesday morning, with continued strong winds expected to fuel them throughout the day. On the other side of Topanga State Park from Pacific Palisades in Calabasas, the Reform synagogue Congregation Or Ami was taking precautions in case conditions changed. 'We have removed Torah scrolls and other sacred/business-critical items from Congregation Or Ami. It’s without power now. We have people whose homes are endangered, people who have friends/relatives who lost homes. In a holding pattern for the moment,' Rabbi Paul Kipnes wrote on Facebook, noting that the Palisades fire was just 17 miles away with winds gusting up to 100 miles per hour at times. 'Distances here feel large yet small.'

Top Israeli broadcaster says Trump should agree to Israel annexin...	Annexing parts of Gaza would be an effective means of achieving the military goal of destroying Hamas, Segal explained. By World Israel News Staff Chief political correspondent Amit Segal in a Wall Street Journal op-ed urged Trump to agree to Israel annexing parts of Gaza. He also insisted that Israel take the distribution of humanitarian aid out of the hands of Hamas as a means of enfeebling the terror group. Annexing parts of Gaza would be an effective means of achieving the military goal of destroying Hamas, Segal explained. He noted that in the Palestinian dialect of Arabic, 'soumod,' or 'standing strong,' is related to the concept of having a claim to land. If Israel were to claim parts of Gaza, Hamas would feel the pangs of utter defeat. Segal argued that the worst case scenario for Hamas would be to have less land at the end of the war than it had at the beginning. In addition, Segal said the IDF gaining control of distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza would prevent Hamas from stealing it and using aid to power its own operations. Losing control of the humanitarian aid, argued Segal, would cause Hamas to collapse 'within weeks.' Israeli forces will remain in the Gaza Strip after the current war with the Hamas terror organization ends, Israel’s defense chief announced emphasizing that the IDF will be responsible for the long-term security control of the coastal enclave. Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) took to X/Twitter a few years later the friends get into some trouble what of minor thing a police case one of to respond to Hebrew media reports earlier in the day claiming he had vowed to U.S. officials that Israel had no interest in controlling post-war Gaza and downplayed calls within the Israeli government to resettle the Gaza Strip. 'Israel does not want either military control or civilian governance over the residents. There are no decisions regarding settlement in Gaza,' Israel’s Channel 12 quoted Katz as telling American officials, adding that the Netanyahu government was working to strengthen the Palestinian Authority against Iranian influence and Hamas encroachment.

Former Israeli military officials float audacious plan to strike ...	For the next week or so, there is basically no administration in Washington to say no to us. So we must use this time to our advantage,' said Benny Sabati, an Iranian-born Iran researcher at INSS. By Andrew Tobin, The Washington Free Beacon Two prominent Israeli national security analysts have proposed that the Jewish state go it alone with major attack on Iran in the final days of Joe Biden's presidency. Kobi Michael and Gabi Siboni, both former senior Israeli military officials, argued in a policy paper published last month that only a series of airstrikes on Iran's nuclear, military, economic, and government infrastructure can prevent the regime from rebuilding its regional terrorist network, which Israel has degraded over 15 months of war. Israel should start the attack just ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, according to the analysts—thereby minimizing the risk of diplomatic retaliation by Biden and forcing the hand of the president-elect. 'With this attack, Israel will demonstrate to the United States … its absolute refusal to accept the continuation of the Iranian nuclear program and its unwillingness to risk Iran’s breakout to a bomb,' Michael and Siboni wrote for the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, a think tank in Jerusalem where they are researchers. 'As several rounds of attacks on Iran will be required, [the subsequent rounds] will take place after Trump takes office and under a U.S. administration that is more sympathetic than Biden's.' Few Israeli politicians would contemplate such a move in public, and even in the think tank world, Michael and Siboni's proposal stands out as audacious. But their paper, which has been discussed in Hebrew media, comes as Israeli leaders signal new willingness to go it alone against Iran if necessary. When prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed for a strike on Iran's nuclear program more than a decade ago, he was repeatedly blocked by his powerful security chiefs and criticized by his political rivals. Today, Israel's security establishment has reportedly advocated such a strike, as have leading politicians across the Zionist political spectrum. In recent months, the Israeli military has smashed Iran's missile and aerial defense capabilities and its terrorist affiliates Hamas and Hezbollah, leaving Iran exposed. Netanyahu has said that Israel's war with Iran and its terrorists affiliates must end in a decisive confrontation with Tehran. But he and his associates have projected confidence that Trump's America will stand with Israel in the fight. 'Iran has one option left, arming itself with a nuclear weapon, and it is striving to achieve this,' Netanyahu said in remarks to the Knesset following Trump's election in November. 'We will be tested by our ability to thwart the nuclear program. We held Iran back by a decade, but it advanced. The test rests upon us, on the government of Israel and on our friend the United States.' Amir Avivi, a former senior Israeli military official who has advised Netanyahu during the war and met with members of Trump's team at the Mar-a-Lago, Florida, headquarters last month, put the odds of a 'massive' joint U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear program at 80 percent. 'I don't see any scenario where Trump ties our hands,' Avivi told the Washington Free Beacon. 'So the question is: Will Trump lead the attack or will we do it alone, and maybe he will provide us with additional capabilities?' But Michael and Siboni assessed that Trump will not want to start his presidency with escalation in the Middle East and will instead 'try to make a deal' with Iran. 'And the Iranians will do what they do best and manipulate the Western negotiators and then subvert any deal they agree to,' Siboni, who is also a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for National Security Studies, told the Free Beacon. 'Israel cannot allow this to happen. We have to strike Iran now.' Michael and Siboni anticipated that Iran would retaliate against Israel, potentially causing significant damage, at which point Trump would step in to provide U.S. military and diplomatic support. In the best case scenario, Trump would also help Israel to finish off Iran. Michael, who is also a researcher at Tel Aviv's Institute for National Security Studies, said that Trump might even appreciate an Israeli strike on Iran before he takes office since it would position him to deliver on his campaign promises to bring peace through strength. 'The idea is to hit the Iranians in a very severe manner that will paralyze them and create the conditions for a new nuclear deal on Trump's terms, which will be very close to the terms sought by Israel,' Michael told the Free Beacon. 'Iran will have to roll back its nuclear program and end its support for terrorism and all the other things it does as the bully of the neighborhood.' Benny Sabati, a Iranian-born Iran researcher at INSS, agreed that Israel should attack Iran before Jan. 20. He said it reminded him of something the Iranians themselves would do. 'When they see a power vacuum, they fill it,' Sabati told the Free Beacon, citing Iran's support for a network of anti-Israel terror groups in failed Middle Eastern states, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. 'For the next week or so, there is basically no administration in Washington to say no to us. So we must use this time to our advantage.' Sima Shine, a former senior official in the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service, and the head of Iran research at INSS, shared her colleagues' assessment that Israel is unlikely to get another shot at Iran under Trump. But she said it was already too late for Israel to attack, noting that Britain, France, and Germany started nuclear talks with Iran in November. 'Anyway, you don't surprise the new president before he takes office,' Shine told the Free Beacon. 'It's just not done.' Asked about the possibility that Trump would not take kindly to being nudged into a military conflict with Iran, Siboni said he preferred an angry Trump to a nuclear Iran. 'At the end of the day, we have to do what we have to do,' he said. Trump has repeatedly declined to say whether he plans to attack Iran. 'It's not really [a legitimate question] because only a stupid person would answer it,' he told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday. 'Look, it's a military strategy, and I'm not answering your questions on military strategy.' The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Trump and members of his transition team were in 'the early stages' of deliberations over 'options for stopping Iran from being able to build a nuclear weapon, including the possibility of preventive airstrikes.' Trump wanted to stop Iran but also to avoid 'igniting a new war, particularly one that could pull in the U.S. military,' according to the report. The Israeli prime minister's office declined to comment.

IDF halts Palestinian workers’ entry into Judea and Samaria commu...	A survey taken last year in Eli, a town of some 4,500 inhabitants in the Binyamin region of southern Samaria, showed that 82% of residents were opposed to readmitting Palestinian workers, regardless of added security measures. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS The Israeli military has suspended the entry of Palestinian workers into Jewish communities throughout Judea and Samaria following Monday morning’s deadly shooting near Kedumim, the Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson’s Unit told JNS on Thursday. The suspension, which the army said came following a 'situational assessment,' will remain in place for an unspecified period. In a message to residents on Wednesday, the Samaria city of Ariel said that a military directive issued after the shooting in al-Funduq that left three Israelis dead, the military had prohibited 'the entry of Palestinian workers into all communities in Samaria, with the exception of industrial areas.' On Thursday, Mayor Yair Chetboun updated residents that following discussions with the commander of the IDF’s Ephraim Regional Brigade, it had been agreed that P.A. workers would be allowed to enter Ariel’s southern neighborhood only, 'starting today.' 'The entry will be allowed while adhering to security procedures,' said Chetboun, whose central Samaria city counts some 21,500 residents. The terrorists who carried out Monday’s shooting, killing Rachel Cohen, 73, Aliza Rice, 70, and Israel Police Master Sgt. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein, 35, remain at large. Seven more people were wounded in the attack. In the wake of the murders, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced on Monday that the premier had approved 'a series of additional offensive and defensive actions in Judea and Samaria.' The shooting took place some six miles northwest of Ariel, the region’s capital, near the northern Samaria Jewish community of Kedumim. While the military banned Palestinians from working in Jewish towns throughout Judea and Samaria in the initial months following Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fox, the then head of IDF Central Command, in late 2023 lifted most of the access restrictions. Before the war, some 200,000 Palestinian workers were employed throughout the Jewish state, including 30,000 in Judea and Samaria. Proposals to readmit P.A. workers to Jewish communities were met with dismay by many. A survey taken last year in Eli, a town of some 4,500 inhabitants in the Binyamin region of southern Samaria, showed that 82% of residents were opposed, regardless of added security measures. However, Israeli courts confirmed in a series of cases that elected local officials do not have the legal right to block Palestinian laborers from entering their communities if the military allows their employment. Two polls last year found that some two-thirds of Palestinians in Judea and Samaria support the Oct. 7 attacks, in which around 6,000 Hamas-led terrorists broke through the Gaza border, murdered some 1,200 people, wounded thousands more and took more than 250 captive.

Lebanon’s parliament elects army commander Joseph Aoun as preside...	In a speech to parliament, Aoun pledged to carry out reforms to the judicial system, fight corruption and work to consolidate the state’s right to 'monopolise the carrying of weapons,' in an apparent allusion to the arms of Hezbollah. By The Associated Press Lebanon’s parliament voted Thursday to elect army commander Joseph Aoun as head of state, filling a more than two-year-long presidential vacuum. The vote came weeks after a tenuous ceasefire agreement halted a 14-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and at a time when Lebanon’s leaders are seeking international assistance for reconstruction. Aoun, no relation to former president Michel Aoun, was widely seen as the preferred candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, whose assistance Lebanon will need as it seeks to rebuild. The session was the legislature’s 13th attempt to elect a successor to Michel Aoun, whose term ended in October 2022. Hezbollah previously backed another candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, the leader of a small Christian party in northern Lebanon with close ties to former Syrian President Bashar Assad. However, on Wednesday, Frangieh announced he had withdrawn from the race and endorsed Aoun, clearing the way for the army chief. Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Middle East Institute, said that the military and political weakening of Hezbollah following its war with Israel and the fall of its ally, Assad, in Syria, along with international pressure to elect a president paved the way for Thursday’s result. In a first round of voting Thursday, Aoun received 71 out of 128 votes but fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to win outright. Of the rest, 37 lawmakers cast blank ballots and 14 voted for 'sovereignty and the constitution.' In the second round, he received 99 votes. The head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc, Mohammed Raad, implied that the group's legislators had withheld their votes from Aoun in the first round but voted for him in the second in bid to show that Hezbollah - even in its diminished state - cannot be politically sidelined. 'We postponed our vote because we wanted to send a message that just as we are protectors of Lebanon’s sovereignty, we are protectors of the national accord,' Raad said after the election. Aoun was escorted by a marching band into the parliament building in downtown Beirut where he took the oath of office. Some streets erupted in celebratory fireworks and gunshots. In Aoun’s hometown of Aichiye in Jezzine province, southern Lebanon, people waved the Lebanese flag and distributed traditional sweets, while local media showed the slaughter of a sheep in celebration. In a speech to parliament, Aoun pledged to carry out reforms to the judicial system, fight corruption and work to consolidate the state’s right to 'monopolise the carrying of weapons,' in an apparent allusion to the arms of Hezbollah. He also promised to control the country’s borders and 'ensure the activation of the security services and to discuss a strategic defense policy that will enable the Lebanese state to remove the Israeli occupation from all Lebanese territories' in southern Lebanon, where the Israeli military has not yet withdrawn from dozens of villages. He also vowed to reconstruct 'what the Israeli army destroyed in the south, east and (Beirut’s southern) suburbs.' Lebanon’s fractious sectarian power-sharing system is prone to deadlock, both for political and procedural reasons. The small, crisis-battered Mediterranean country has been through several extended presidential vacancies, with the longest lasting nearly 2 1/2 years between May 2014 and October 2016. It ended when former President Michel Aoun was elected. The president's role in Lebanon is limited under the power-sharing system in which the president is always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament Shiite. However, only the president has the power to appoint or remove a prime minister and cabinet. The caretaker government that has run Lebanon for the last two years has reduced powers because it was not appointed by a sitting president. Joseph Aoun is the fifth former army commander to ascend to Lebanon’s presidency, despite the fact that the country's constitution prohibits high-ranking public servants, including army commanders, from assuming the presidency during their term or within two years of stepping down. Under normal circumstances, a presidential candidate in Lebanon can be elected by a two-thirds majority of the 128-member house in the first round of voting, or by a simple majority in a subsequent round. But because of the constitutional issues surrounding his election, Aoun needed a two-thirds majority in the second round to clinch the election. Aoun, 60, was appointed army chief in March 2017 and had been set to retire in January 2024, but his term was extended twice during the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. He kept a low profile and avoided media appearances and never formally announced his candidacy. Other contenders included Jihad Azour, a former finance minister who is now the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund; and Elias al-Baysari, the acting head of Lebanon’s General Security agency. Al-Baisary announced Thursday that he was pulling out of the race. The next government will face daunting challenges apart from implementing the ceasefire agreement that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war and seeking funds for reconstruction. Lebanon is in its sixth year of an economic and financial crisis that decimated the country's currency and wiped out the savings of many Lebanese. The cash-strapped state electricity company provides only a few hours of power a day. The country's leaders reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF for a bail-out package in 2022 but have made limited progress on reforms required to clinch the deal. Slim, the analyst, said that 'the fact that (Aoun) has the backing of Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and the Europeans give him a big boost in terms of being able to get things done,' Slim said. But he will still have to 'navigate the contradiction that are inherent in domestic Lebanese politics,' she said, including relations with Hezbollah, which is not only a militant group but a political party with a strong base of support. Aoun 'has never had a conflictual relationship with Hezbollah, but he has also never acquiesced to Hezbollah,' Slim said. The army commander’s relative lack of experience with economic matters means he will likely lean heavily on his advisors.

US ‘very close’ to securing hostage deal, Gaza ceasefire, says Bl...	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and a Hamas spokesman both say a hostage deal is 'not far' off, even as both signal agreement may not be reached before Trump's inauguration this month. By World Israel News Staff Israel and Hamas are close to reaching a breakthrough in hostage deal and ceasefire talks in Doha, Qatar U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and a Hamas spokesperson both claimed Wednesday, even as they acknowledged a deal may not be struck before President Joe Biden leaves office on January 20th. Speaking at a press conference in Paris on Wednesday alongside his French counterpart, Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, Blinken said that brokers were 'very close' to achieving an agreement between the two sides. While a deal may not be reached by January 20th, Blinken admitted, the incoming Trump administration will be left well-positioned to complete the talks, he argued, crediting President Joe Biden's proposal for a three-phase deal. 'I hope that we can get it over the line in the time that we have left, but if we don’t, then the plan that President Biden put forward for a ceasefire-hostage deal will be handed over to the incoming administration, and I believe that when we get that deal — and we’ll get it — it’ll be based on the plan that President Biden put before the world back in May.' Blinken expressed hope that the administration's work to prepare post-war arrangements for the governance of the Gaza Strip will be adopted by the Trump White House. 'There too, we’re ready to hand that over to the administration so it can work on it and run with it when the opportunity is there.' The Biden administration has pushed for the transfer of Israeli control over the post-war Gaza Strip to a reformed Palestinian Authority, preventing Hamas from reasserting itself in the coastal enclave while removing the need for long-term Israeli civil control of Gaza - a key condition for bringing Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords. Also on Wednesday, Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nunu spoke with Saudi Arabia's Al-Resalah television network, claiming that the terror group is 'not far from an agreement' - assuming Israel 'responds positively' to Hamas' demands. On Tuesday, Hamas politburo member Osama Hamdan told reporters at a press conference in Algeria that the terror group would not agree to any deal with Israel that does not include a full withdrawal of the IDF From the Gaza Strip, and a full and permanent end to the war.

More than 18,000 terror attacks were carried out in Israel during 2024, killing 134 people and injuring 1,277 more, Israeli government reported. By World Israel News Staff More than 18,000 terror attacks targeting Israelis were reported in 2024, according to an Israeli government report released on Thursday. The National Public Diplomacy Directorate, a part of the Prime Minister's Office published the statistics in its 'Summary Report on Terrorism Against Israel for 2024,' revealing that a total of 18,365 terrorist attacks were reported during last year, leaving 134 dead and 1,277 more injured. The report drew upon data collected by the IDF, Israel Police, the Israeli Security Agency (ISA), and the emergency and rescue authorities. During 2024, Israel was attacked on seven separate fronts, including Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and from within Israel itself. According to the report, in 2024, about 16,400 rockets were fired and crossed into Israel, of which some 15,400 were launched from Lebanon and some 700 from Gaza. October 2024 had the greatest number of rockets fired at Israel, with more than 6,900 launches. A total of 399 hostile UAVs crossed into Israeli territory during 2024. Rocket fire and UAVs caused significant damage last year, with 71 people killed, 14 of whom were minors, and 892 people injured. In addition, the attacks sparked close to 610 fires, which burned 92,417 acres of land belonging to the Nature and Parks Authority, and more than 42,749 acres of grazing land. An additional 1,900 other terrorist incidents were carried out in 2024, including stone throwing, Molotov cocktails, vehicle rammings, shootings, stabbings, assaults, explosive devices and throwing objects. July had the highest number of incidents—191 attacks. November was the quietest month with 109 attacks. October was the most violent month, in which 37 people were murdered and 394 injured. The most common type of terrorist attack was stone throwing, with 1,248 incidents. April had the most stone throwings, with 130 incidents and November was the quietest with 76 incidents. The next most common attacks were throwing objects, arson and tire burning (162), throwing Molotov cocktails (140), shootings (132) and explosive devices (89).

Trump will enable Israel to open ‘the gates of hell’ against Hama...	Senior Israeli minister pushes for Israel to govern Gaza 'for a very long time,' says Israeli control can't be limited to security. By World Israel News Staff Israel will unleash the 'gates of hell' against the Hamas terror organization after President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20th, a senior Israeli government minister said Wednesday. Speaking during a question and answer session on Facebook Live, Finance Minister and Religious Zionist Party chairman Bezalel Smotrich said Israel would dramatically ratchet up pressure on Hamas and significantly reduce the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip, if an when Trump gives Jerusalem backing to do so. Smotrich predicted that Trump, who has repeatedly warned Hamas that the terror group will have 'hell to pay' if it fails to release the remaining hostages by inauguration day this month, will give his blessing to Israeli measures cutting the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip down to a bare minimum. Once Trump takes office, Israel is prepared to 'open the gates of hell on Hamas,' Smotrich said. The minister added that Israel is preparing to take long-term control over the Gaza Strip. 'We’re readying for a new approach to conquering the Gaza Strip, of holding onto it, of dividing it into regional brigades,' Smotrich continued, saying Israel should remain in Gaza 'for a very long time.' 'The military pressure will be stronger, not entering and exiting but capturing territory.' Smotrich, a long-time backer of the settlement movement, has advocated since October 7th for the resettlement of the Gaza Strip, and steps to encourage the voluntary emigration of the coastal enclave's Arab population. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit), who also advocates the resettlement of the Gaza Strip and policies designed to encourage mass Arab emigration from the area, claimed last year that despite his statements against such plans earlier in the war, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is quietly warming to the proposals.

Poland’s president offers to shield Netanyahu from ICC arrest war...	Ahead of event marking the 80th anniversary of liberation of Auschwitz, Polish President Andrzej Duda calls on the government to ensure Israeli Prime Minister will be able to attend the ceremony without fear of arrest over ICC warrant. By World Israel News Staff Poland's president called on his country's government to take steps to enable Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be able to visit the country during the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. On January 27th, the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum will hold a ceremony marking 80 years since the concentration camp was liberated by Allied forces. In December, Polish media outlets reported that Netanyahu had declined to attend the event, fearing his arrest over the International Criminal Court's warrant, issued last year in connection with the Gaza war. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Polish President Andrzej Duda has penned a letter to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, urging him to take steps to ensure that Netanyahu will not face ICC prosecution if he visits Poland for the event. Duda said the Polish government should guarantee that the Israeli premier can visit Poland and take part in the ceremony 'unhindered,' calling on Tusk's government to find an 'adequate formula' to this end. Hours after the Bloomberg report was published Thursday, an aide to Prime Minister Netanyahu told The Times of Israel that the Israeli premier currently has no plans to attend the Auschwitz memorial event, but added that the prime minister's office would consider his attendance should Israel receive an invitation. We’ll look into [coming] if we receive an invitation. For now it’s not in the program,' the aide said. The source added, however, that Poland would also have to 'solve' the issue of the ICC arrest warrant before Netanyahu could commit to attending. 'First of all, they’ll have to solve the ICC issue.'

Arab-Israeli arrested over bombing plot	37-year-old Arab-Israeli man from northern Israel prepared bomb belt and pipe bombs for bombing attacks against Israelis. By World Israel News Staff An Arab man with Israeli citizenship was arrested recently, after he plotted to carry out bombing attacks against Israeli targets. In a joint operation by the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and the Northern District Central Unit of the Israel Police, Mahmoud Hassan Mohammed Boushkar, a 37-year-old resident of Kabul (a town in northern Israel), was arrested by the Border Police undercover unit. Boushkar, whose father is originally from Judea and Samaria, is accused of planning and preparing for terror attacks in Israel. According to the investigation by Shin Bet and the police, Boushkar consumed materials related to the production of explosives and purchased equipment and substances to conduct experiments. These included the production of TATP explosives and the creation of a pipe bomb. He allegedly planned to construct an explosive belt for potential attacks within Israel. Further findings revealed that Boushkar attempted to recruit two individuals to assist him in advancing his activities, though these efforts were unsuccessful. The investigation highlighted that Boushkar was inspired by the 'Guardian of the Walls' conflict in May 2021 and the ongoing war, which motivated him to pursue terrorist activities. During the investigation, authorities seized a firearm, ammunition, and various materials and tools used for bomb-making. On January 9, 2025, the Haifa District Attorney's Office filed an indictment against Boushkar in the Haifa District Court. The Shin Bet and Israel Police emphasized their commitment to preventing any involvement of Israeli citizens in activities that threaten national security. They vowed to use all available means to neutralize such threats and ensure that those involved face the full weight of the law.

Terrorist attempted Jerusalem attack in order to die ‘as a martyr...	The eastern Jerusalem resident told his interrogators that he had wanted to die as a 'martyr.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The Jerusalem District Attorney's Office filed Thursday its official declaration of intent to indict a terrorist who attempted to stab a soldier in the capital last month. According to the details of the investigation, the man, a resident of eastern Jerusalem in his early thirties, had expressed his desire to die as a 'martyr.' He bought a knife in a home improvement store three days before his attack. In the early afternoon of December 23, he drove to the neighborhood of Pisgat Ze’ev, and when he saw a soldier walking down the street, he exited his vehicle. He approached his intended victim, waving the knife in the air and shouting, 'Allahu Akbar [God is great], I will kill you and stab you in the head.' Keeping his cool, the soldier first tried shouting and warning the terrorist off, but when he continued advancing, both he and a civilian bystander who was witnessing the incident shot and seriously wounded the attacker. According to a Channel 10 report, even while lying on the ground the terrorist kept trying to reach for his weapon. Large numbers of police forces descended on the scene, as did medical personnel, who treated the wounded suspect and took him to the hospital for treatment. Jerusalem Police Chief Ronen Ovadia praised both men for taking quick action, saying, 'The vigilance and alertness of the security officer, along with the vigilance of citizens, prevented harm to life and the source of danger was quickly neutralized.' The prosecutor's statement is a tool in Israeli law that allows a suspect to be kept in custody for a period of up to five more days after the end of the police investigation so that a lawyer can prepare the list of charges. Police are not allowed to re-interrogate detainees during this time unless they request and receive from a judge an extension of their detention. The prosecutor must declare that, based on a personal examination of the evidence, there is prima facie reason to file an indictment in the case, and request that the suspect now be arrested and considered a defendant in an upcoming case. Usually in nationalist-motivated crimes, defendants are held in custody until the end of the legal proceedings against them.

NY Times rejects ad accusing Israel of ‘genocide’; blasted for ‘s...	The Quakers organization blasted the paper for its 'outrageous attempt to sidestep the truth.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The New York Times has enraged a potential advertiser by rejecting its ad calling Israel’s war against Hamas a 'genocide.' The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), known colloquially as the Quakers, said Monday that it had submitted a digital ad asking people to tell Congress to 'stop arming Israel’s genocide in Gaza now.' They said that a representative of the paper's advertising department responded by suggesting they use the word 'war' instead. When they vetoed the suggestion since it had 'an entirely different meaning both colloquially and under international law,' they received an email stating that their ad could not be accepted as is. AFSC General Secretary Joyce Ajlouny called the paper’s refusal 'an outrageous attempt to sidestep the truth.' She defended the peace organization’s wording by pointing out that groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have made the same charge against the Jewish state, as have 'UN bodies,' and noting that the International Court of Justice is allowing a case to go forward against Israel on the subject. These international organizations are well known for their anti-Israel bias, which the Quakers share. Ajlouny also described NYT’s refusal as being hypocritical, as she noted that the paper 'regularly looks to several of these organizations as sources for its own reporting.' She also accused the media in general of 'choos[ing] silence over accountability' in 'silencing' and 'marginalizing' Palestinians and their allies 'for decades.' According to AFSC, the paper’s email had said in part, 'Various international bodies, human rights organizations, and governments have differing views on the situation. In line with our commitment to factual accuracy and adherence to legal standards, we must ensure that all advertising content complies with these widely applied definitions.' Israel and many of its allies have repeatedly pointed out that the IDF always warns Gazan civilians to move out of harm’s way before its forces enter areas to clear them of Hamas fighters as well as look for the 98 hostages left in captivity since the October 7th, 2023 terrorist invasion and massacre of 1,200 sparked the ongoing war. Instead of indiscriminately killing everyone in a war zone, the IDF first sets up guarded, humanitarian corridors to facilitate civilians’ escape, thereby losing the element of surprise against its foes. Israel has also allowed into Gaza hundreds of thousands of tons of food, fuel, shelter equipment and medical supplies over the last 15 months. AFSC said that since they couldn’t use the wording they desired, they pulled the ad.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also expected to attend the inauguration, though Wednesday’s announcement did not mention any plans for the relatives of the hostages to meet with him. By Ben Sales, JTA Relatives of the seven American hostages held in Gaza will attend Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, representatives of the families announced. The announcement Wednesday comes as Trump and outgoing President Joe Biden are both working to close a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would free some of the nearly 100 hostages, dead and alive, who have been held there since Hamas abducted them in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Deputies for both Trump and Biden are saying that a deal is close, though the sides have appeared optimistic in the past only for talks to falter. At a press conference on Tuesday, Trump threatened that 'if they’re not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East and it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone.' Representatives for the families of the American hostages also said that the relatives will meet with Trump administration officials when they are in Washington, D.C. for three days surrounding the inauguration. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also expected to attend the inauguration, though Wednesday’s announcement did not mention any plans for the relatives of the hostages to meet with him. Israeli officials have confirmed that four of the seven U.S. citizens held in Gaza have been killed and that Hamas is holding their bodies in Gaza. They are Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, and husband and wife Gad Haggai and Judith Weinstein. Americans Keith Siegel, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Edan Alexander are also being held captive. The relatives in attendance will be either parents, children, siblings or the spouse of a hostage. Two sets of parents who spoke at last summer’s political conventions — those of Neutra and of hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was murdered in captivity — will be among the attendees.

Israeli army issues new social media guidelines as soldiers face ...	In recent weeks, soldiers traveling in Britain, Cyprus, Brazil and Thailand were forced to return to Israel early after being notified they were at risk of being arrested. By Pesach Benson, TPS Due to the threat of arrest warrants for low-ranking soldiers traveling abroad, the Israel Defense Forces issued new social media guidelines. Personnel ranked colonel and below were advised not to expose their names or faces on social media. Troops should only post photos taken from behind or with faces blurred. And soldiers with foreign citizenship were ordered not to reveal their names or faces, even outside a combat zone. Israeli media was also instructed not to link specific soldiers to particular operational incidents they were involved in. In recent weeks, soldiers traveling in Britain, Cyprus, Brazil and Thailand were forced to return to Israel early after being notified they were at risk of being arrested. The Hind Rajab Foundation, a non-governmental organization based in Belgium has been filing requests for arrest warrants for Israeli soldiers traveling abroad. The Press Service of Israel recently reported that the NGO, founded in September 2024, is linked to Hezbollah. Its chairman, Dyab Abou Jahjah, is a known supporter of Hezbollah, according to the NGO Monitor, a Jerusalem-based organization that monitors the activities and funding of NGOs. Jahjah boasted of his membership in the terror group when he told The New York Times in 2003, 'I had some military training, I’m still very proud of this.' The foundation has filed similar legal complaints against Israeli soldiers traveling in other countries, including the Netherlands and Ecuador. It also petitioned the International Criminal Court to issue Interpol arrest warrants against 1,000 Israeli soldiers in eight different countries, including France, Ireland, and South Africa, according to the foundation’s website. Alon Elgali, a civilian contractor who works for the army in Gaza told The Press Service of Israel on Sunday that Hind Rajab recently forced him to leave London early. 'They knew I was at a wedding in London and its whereabouts. They followed my every step,' he told TPS-IL. 'If you ask me if I’m scared to fly, yes I am very scared.' Asked for a comment, London’s Metropolitan Police told TPS-IL, 'As with any crime reported to police, we would not comment on the identity of those making a report or referral to police, so I’m afraid we are not able to comment as to whether or not the particular NGO referenced below has made a referral or not.' The police added, 'More broadly, in relation to the ongoing Israel/Hamas conflict, we have received a large number of referrals since October 2023, but to-date, none have resulted in us opening a UK-based investigation. Referrals into us have related to parties on both sides of the conflict, although we are not providing any further breakdown of the nature of referrals.' Legal expert Maurisce Hirsch told TPS-IL that countries that do not recognize the International Criminal Court’s jurisdiction, such as the US, India and China, are relatively safe for soldiers to travel to. Hirsch –a senior legal analyst at Human Rights Voices, who served previously as Director of the Military Prosecution in Judea and Samaria — added that regarding complaints filed by anti-Israeli NGOs, the situation differs from country to country. 'Many countries have legislation that allows them to prosecute war criminals, even if they are not citizens of the country. It is the so-called ‘universal authority,’ Hirsch said. 'And every country has its own rules regarding this. In the UK, for example, they changed the legislation a few years ago, and now only the government can file a complaint like this, but not an NGO or a private person. In Belgium the situation is different.'

Trend reversal: Poll shows most Israelis oppose Palestinian state	The degree of confidence in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stayed steady, with 33% among the Jewish public and 8% among Arabs. By Canaan Lindor, JNS For the first time in nearly 18 years, a majority of Israeli Jews now oppose the establishment of any Palestinian state, according to an opinion poll published on Monday. Of the 804 Jews polled in the 'Swords of Iron Survey Results—December 2024' survey by Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), 64% opposed the creation of a Palestinian state 'under any condition,' compared to 23% who said they supported it 'under certain conditions.' The remaining 13% said they didn’t know. Among the 205 Arabs polled, the distribution was 59%, 12% and 29% respectively. Within the total sample of 1,009 Jewish and Arab respondents, 52% opposed the creation of any Palestinian state compared to 30% who supported it. Respondents were polled on a host of issues, including their degree of trust in various institutions. Among Jews, 85% indicated 'great confidence' in the Israel Defense Forces, versus 34% among Arabs. Confidence in the government remained stable with 25% among the Jewish public and 9% among Arabs. Confidence in the government was at 27% in an INSS poll from December 2022. The degree of confidence in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also stayed steady, INSS wrote, with 33% among the Jewish public and 8% among Arabs. Asked whether the terms of the ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon allow a return of evacuees, 48.5% of Jews said no, compared to 38% who said yes. Still, 50% of Jews supported the ceasefire compared to 27% who opposed it. The remaining 23% said they were neutral or did not know. Regarding the war with Hamas, 51% of Jews said the war objectives will be achieved either in full (10%) or to a large degree. Among Jews, 38% were more pessimistic, predicting none or very few of the objectives would be met. Arab respondents were even more skeptical, with 22% predicting total or meaningful achievements for Israel and 52% expecting no or few achievements. A third of Jewish respondents supported Israeli annexation of the Gaza Strip, and out of that third more than half indicated that they favored the reestablishment of Israeli settlements there. Just over half of Jews favored transferring Gaza to the control of either a Palestinian 'moderate party' or a regional or international entity. A tenth of Jews said they didn’t know. Among Arabs, Israeli annexation had an 8% approval rating; 54% supported regional or Palestinian rule and 38% said they didn’t know. In the years 2006-2019, support among Jews for a Palestinian state under certain conditions fell from 71% to 55%, according to an INSS overview from 2020. In 2022 support among Jews was 50% and support in the overall population was 52%. The survey released on Monday had a reported 3.5% error margin.

With Hezbollah weakened, Lebanon to hold presidential vote	Candidates in focus include army commander General Joseph Aoun — said by Lebanese politicians to enjoy US approval — Jihad Azour, a senior International Monetary Fund official who formerly served as finance minister, and Major-General Elias al-Baysari — head of General Security, a state security agency. By The Algemeiner and Reuters Lebanon‘s parliament will try to elect a president on Thursday, with officials seeing better chances of success in a political landscape shaken by Israel’s war with Hezbollah and the toppling of the Lebanese terrorist group’s ally Bashar al-Assad in neighboring Syria. The post, reserved for a Maronite Christian in the country’s sectarian power-sharing system, has been vacant since Michel Aoun’s term ended in October, 2022. None of the political groups in the 128-seat parliament have enough seats to impose their choice, and they have so far been unable to agree on a consensus candidate. The vote marks the first test of Lebanon‘s power balance since the Iran-backed Shi’ite terrorist group Hezbollah — which propelled its then Christian ally Aoun to the presidency in 2016 ‚ emerged badly pummeled from the war with Israel. It takes place against a backdrop of historic change in the wider Middle East, where the Assad-led Syrian state exercised sway over Lebanon for decades, both directly and through allies such as Hezbollah. Reflecting the shifts, Hezbollah and its ally the Shi’ite Amal Movement led by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri have dropped their insistence on Suleiman Frangieh, their declared candidate for the last two years, and are ready to go with a less divisive figure, three senior sources familiar with their thinking said. Candidates in focus include army commander General Joseph Aoun — said by Lebanese politicians to enjoy US approval — Jihad Azour, a senior International Monetary Fund official who formerly served as finance minister, and Major-General Elias al-Baysari — head of General Security, a state security agency. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said he felt happy because 'God willing, tomorrow we will have a new president,' according to a statement from his office. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also expressed hope in comments to France Inter radio, saying the election was 'a prerequisite for the continuation of this dynamic of peace' and also for Lebanon‘s economic and social recovery. However, two of the sources and an analyst cautioned that it was not yet certain any candidate would be elected. To win, a candidate must secure 86 votes in a first round, or 65 in a second round. Reflecting Western and regional interest in the vote, French and Saudi envoys met Lebanese politicians in Beirut on Wednesday. Four Lebanese political sources who met the Saudi envoy, Prince Yazid bin Farhan, last week said he spelt out preferred qualifications which signal Saudi support for Aoun. Saudi Arabia was once a big player in Lebanon, vying with Tehran for influence in Beirut, before seeing its role eclipsed by Iran and Hezbollah. HEZBOLLAH STILL SEEN WITH SWAY Aoun, head of Lebanon‘s US-backed army, would still need 86 votes because his election requires a constitutional amendment, as he is a still-serving state employee, Berri has said. A State Department spokesperson said it was 'up to Lebanon to choose its next president, not the United States or any external actor.' 'We have been consistent in our efforts to press Lebanon to elect a new president, which we see as important to strengthening Lebanon’s political institutions,' the spokesperson said. Hezbollah official Wafiq Safa said last week there was 'no veto' on Aoun. But the sources said Hezbollah, designated a terrorist group by the United States and other countries, will not support Aoun. Aoun has a key role in shoring up the ceasefire brokered by Washington and Paris in November. The terms require the Lebanese military to deploy into south Lebanon as Israeli troops and Hezbollah withdraw forces. Still reeling from a financial collapse in 2019, Lebanon desperately needs foreign aid to rebuild. Much of the damage is in Shi’ite majority areas. Hezbollah, its supply line to Iran severed by Assad’s ousting, has urged Arab and international support for Lebanon. Lebanon‘s Maronite Bishops called on lawmakers to elect a president, urging a 'national awakening.' Nabil Boumonsef, deputy editor-in-chief of Annahar newspaper, was not certain anyone would be elected, even after the major shift in the balance of power in Lebanon, where Hezbollah‘s weapons have long been a source of division. Underlining the influence Hezbollah and Amal still wield, he said the only way a president could be elected would be if they agreed on Aoun or Azour. But if they tried to install their preferred candidate, this would 'sever the oxygen from Lebanon.' Saudi Minister Faisal bin Farhan said last October that Riyadh had never fully disengaged from Lebanon and that outside countries should not tell Lebanese what to do.

Golani Druze view of Jewish state changing after Assad’s fall, Is...	Under the new Syrian leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani, there is an opportunity for engagement, according to Tarif. By Andrew Bernard, JNS The fall of Bashar Assad in Syria is opening new doors for the Druze community in the Israeli Golan Heights, Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, told JNS on Wednesday. Speaking in Arabic via a translator at a Hudson Institute event in Washington, Tarif said fear of the Assads had limited the hand of the Druze in their four villages in the Golan. Under the new Syrian leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani, there is an opportunity for engagement, according to Tarif. 'We cannot forget that the previous regime was merciless,' he said. 'When the 1973 war started, the first thing they struck was the Druze. Before they even struck the army.' Israel captured the Golan Heights in June 1967, and with it, four predominantly Druze towns that maintain close relations with the Druze community across the border in Syria. Unlike the Druze communities that became part of Israel in 1948 and are integrated into Israeli society as citizens and often as volunteer soldiers, most of the Druze in the Golan Heights, in towns like Majdal Shams, rejected Israeli citizenship. A Hezbollah rocket launched from Lebanon in July that fell in Majdal Shams, striking a soccer field and killing 12 Druze children, coupled with Assad’s fall in December, has raised the question of whether Druze in the Golan might be open to a new relationship with the Jewish state. 'The people of Majdal Shams were scared to normalize or become citizens of Israel because of the Assad regime,' Tarif said. 'Now the situation is different.' 'The barriers are broken. There are no more barriers,' he said. 'Some of them I used to talk to in secret. Now they’re talking to me in public.' 'They’re saying ‘When are you coming to visit?’ and ‘When are we going to go visit?’ You didn’t hear that before,' Tarif added. 'Julani has a golden opportunity to show the world that he is capable of change.' ‘Islam is different’ The status of minorities, including Druze, Christians and Alawites, in Julani’s Syria is one of the most pressing questions after the fall of Assad. Syria’s approximately 700,000 Druze make up about 3% of the nation’s population, with most living in the southeastern province of Suwayda, where they are a majority of the population, or around the capital Damascus. They have long faced oppression as an ethno-religious minority, which is usually described as a distinct Abrahamic religion separate from Islam. In recent years, they have faced persecution—ranging from forced conversion to massacres—from Sunni Islamist groups. In 2018, ISIS carried out a string of suicide bombings and other attacks in Suwayda that killed more than 250 Druze, and the terrorist group kidnapped more than 30 Druze women and children. In 2015, members of the Nusrah Front, which was Syria’s al-Qaeda branch and the predecessor to Julani’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, shot 20 Druze in the northwest province of Idlib after accusing them of being infidels. Officials from the new government have said that they 'guarantee' the religious rights of all Syrians, but many remain skeptical. Tarif told JNS that after the fall of Assad, the Druze of Syria want a society that respects minority rights and is free from religious compulsion. 'Islam is different. For example, for us Druze, we don’t allow polygamy, but Julani calls for it,' Tarif said. 'They’re going around telling people to wear scarves, and not everybody is religious. I have two other brothers. One brother is not religious.' 'The important thing that the Druze practice is that nothing is to be done by force,' he added. 'You do not force anyone into a belief or a practice.'

Iran was ‘defeated very badly’ in Syria, general admits	Iranian general admits in leaked audio recording that he is 'not proud' of overthrow of long-time ally Bashar Assad in Syria, calls his ouster a 'very big blow' to Tehran. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior Iranian officer admitted that the Islamic republic suffered a stinging defeat with the loss of the Assad regime in Syria last month, blaming deposed President Bashar Assad and his Russian allies for the rebel takeover. According to a report published by The New York Times on Wednesday, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Brig. Gen. Behrouz Esbati - commander of Iranian forces in Syria prior to the ouster of Assad on December 8th - spoke candidly at a Tehran mosque last week regarding Iran's 'defeat' in Syria. A recording of his speech was leaked to Iranian media and dissident outlets, the Times reported, revealing both Esbati's harsh criticism of Iran's allies including the Assad regime and the Russian military, and the impact of the loss of a key long-time ally of Tehran. 'I don’t consider losing Syria something to be proud of,' Esbati said. 'We were defeated, and defeated very badly, we took a very big blow and it’s been very difficult.' Esbati argued that former President Bashar Assad was himself partially to blame for his ouster, claiming the Syrian leader had declined Iranian offers of assistance. Assad's defeat came following a months-long period of strained ties with Iran, after the Syrian president rebuffed multiple requests by Tehran to launch a large-scale attack on Israel from Syrian territory using local pro-Iranian militias. The IRGC officer also accused Russia's military of misleading Iran, claiming that Moscow had told Tehran that its air force was carrying out an aggressive air campaign against Syrian rebel forces, while Russian planes were in fact dropping their ordinance in open fields, Esbati claimed. While Iran has ostensibly reached out to the new Syrian leadership - led by Sunni fundamentalists who have long advocated for the termination of Iranian influence in their country - Esbati hinted at a possible campaign to overthrow the provisional government. 'We can activate all the networks we have worked with over the years,' he said. 'We can activate the social layers that our guys lived among for years; we can be active in social media and we can form resistance cells.'

Israel nearly bombed Beirut Airport to stop Iran money transfers	An Iranian diplomat aboard the plane refused to allow a search of his bag, which was later confiscated by Lebanese security. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military was prepared to bomb Beirut Airport, but held off on the attack after a transfer of millions of dollars in funding from Iran to Hezbollah did not occur. According to a report from Saudi outlet Al Arabiya, a recent flight from Iran to Lebanon raised suspicions among Israel's intelligence agencies. Israeli officials believed that Iran was planning to use the flight to smuggle millions of dollars to the Hezbollah terror organization. That suspicion was supported by a separate report from Al-Hadith, which said that Western officials also speculated that the flight was be leveraged to support Hezbollah. Upon landing, Iranian officials attempted to prevent airport officials from searching the plane, sparking further concerns about what was carried onboard. An Iranian diplomat aboard the plane refused to allow a search of his bag, which was later confiscated by Lebanese security. A search of the plane and the bags of the passengers did not turn up the funds, so Israel did not attack the airport. According to an October 2024 report from JBN, Hezbollah's main sources of funding have been seriously impacted by the fighting with Israel. Many of Lebanon's biggest commercial banks are wary that providing funds to Hezbollah could place them in Israel's crosshairs. 'I’m hearing from Lebanese bankers, including Hezbollah financiers, that Lebanon’s wealthiest bankers who can afford to fly have fled to Europe and the Gulf, fearing they could be targeted next by Israel for helping Hezbollah,' former State Department official David Asher told JBN. 'These Lebanese bankers, most of them billionaires, see the wind is blowing against Hezbollah, so they are not going to let it take millions of dollars out of their banks, which still have cash despite being bankrupt on paper,' he added. 'They know that if they do, Israel probably will eliminate them, too.'

3 soldiers KIA in Gaza fighting, bringing death toll to 401	The soldiers were killed by a large explosive fired at their tank, in the northern Strip city of Beit Hanoun./Strong> By World Israel News Staff Three Israeli soldiers were killed in battle in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, bringing the IDF death toll for the ground invasion of the coastal enclave to 401. The late troops were identified as Staff Sgt. Matityahu Ya’akov Perel, 22, from Beit El, Staff Sgt. Kanaoo Kasa, 22, from Beit Shemesh, and Staff Sgt. Nevo Fisher, 20, from Bruchin. All of the men served in the 401st Armored Brigade’s 46th Battalion, and were operating in Beit Hanoun, in the northern Strip. Initial findings from an IDF probe into the incident, which wounded three others, that the soldiers' tank was stuck by a 'large explosive device.' Perel was moderately wounded in battle several months ago, but insisted upon returning to his unit and continuing to fight against Hamas. According to a statement eulogizing Perel by a local community leader, Matanya Shnerb, two of his relatives fell in battle during the War of Independence and the First Lebanon War. He is survived by his parents and several siblings. Kasa was from 'a family of immigrants from Ethiopia, a 22-year-old in mandatory service who fought on the front lines from the beginning of the war,' read a statement from the Beit Shemesh municipality. The 18th soldier from Beit Shemesh to be killed in action, Kasa is survived by his parents and five brothers and sisters. Fisher's parents were among the founders of Bruchin, the town where he was born and raised. He is survived by his parents and three siblings. Since the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip began in late October 2023, 401 soldiers have been killed. Counting deaths that occurred on October 7th and in the battles before the ground invasion, a total of 830 soldiers have been killed since the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.

Hezbollah’s pick for president of Lebanon backs out of race	The presidency, which, according to Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system, must go to a Maronite Christian, has been vacant since 2022, when Michel Aoun's term ended. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hezbollah's favored candidate for the presidency of Lebanon announced on Wednesday that he was dropping out of the race. The Lebanese terror group had backed Marada Movement leader Suleiman Frangieh, who said he was backing out of the election and instead endorsed Lebanese army commander General Joseph Aoun. Frangieh said, 'Given that the conditions for electing a president of the republic are now in place and in light of the current circumstances, I hereby announce the withdrawal of my candidacy, which has never been an obstacle to the electoral process.' He added, 'I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who supported me. As I have previously stated, I fully endorse General Joseph Aoun, who possesses the qualifications necessary to safeguard the presidency. I wish the Parliament success in the election process, and I hope the nation navigates this critical phase with unity, awareness, and responsibility.' The presidency, which, according to Lebanon's power-sharing system, must go to a Maronite Christian, has been vacant since 2022, when Michel Aoun's term ended. No political party in Lebanon's 128-seat parliament has been able to impose its choice, and there is a lack of consensus on whether a candidate should fill the position. Hezbollah rescinded its support for Frangieh and is apparently willing to compromise with a less extreme candidate. As the 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon nears its end, Israeli officials are expressing doubts about Beirut's ability to uphold the agreement in the long term. 'With January 27th still some time away, a lot can change in this region,' a senior Israeli political source told The Press Service of Israel. 'The decision to fully withdraw from Lebanon could be made as late as 24 hours before the ceasefire ends. Additionally, Lebanon still faces a prolonged process of electing a president, and further developments in Syria are expected. For all intents and purposes, we are keeping the option of extending the [IDF's] presence on the table.'

‘We love and support you’: NFL legends pay solidarity visit to Is...	The trip was made possible with the support of Athletes for Israel, an organization committed to combating antisemitism and racism while promoting a positive narrative about Israel. By Rolene Marks, JNS NFL legends Nick Lowery and Tony Richardson touched down in Israel last week on a solidarity visit. Their itinerary included visits to the Nova Festival memorial, kibbutzim affected by the Hamas massacre on Oct. 7, 2023, and the Druze village of Majdal Shams, where 12 children lost their lives on a soccer pitch to Hezbollah attacks. Lowery, who played 18 seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs and New York Jets, and Richardson, who played 17 seasons for the Dallas Cowboys, Kansas City Chiefs, Minnesota Vikings, and New York Jets, are both ambassadors of Project Max. Bringing together professional athletes from around the world, Project Max is committed to combating intolerance through sports. The trip was made possible with the support of Athletes for Israel, an organization committed to combating antisemitism and racism while promoting a positive narrative about Israel. The two spent time with family members of hostages currently held in Gaza, including Yoni and Amit Levy, the father and brother of Na’ama Levy. They also met with IDF soldiers and Israeli officials, including President Isaac Herzog. Lowery told the president about his experience meeting with hostage families, saying, 'We’re here to say we love and support you—no matter what.' Richardson emphasized the importance of being a voice for those who do not have one. During a meeting with Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana the delegation discussed the importance of Israeli resilience and of the visitors’ steadfast support for Israel. Eric Rubin, a member of the Athletes for Israel advisory board and the CEO of Project Max, told JNS about the importance of the visit to Majdal Shams. 'During former NBA Champion Josh Powell’s visit to Israel, we met some of the survivors of the Majdal Shams attack in Ichilov hospital. During that visit, we heard the horror stories, but also saw the resilience of the children and their families. I committed to them that I would do what I could to make sure the world didn’t forget what happened to the 12 angels and all the survivors,' he said. Bringing Lowery and Richardson to Majdal Shams was Rubin’s way to keep that promise. 'But at the same time, it was extremely important to meet with the families, hear the dreams and aspirations of these children who were brutally murdered, and do what we could to try and bring some hope, positivity, love, support and smiles to our beautiful Druze cousins,' Rubin added. Lowery and Robinson also toured the holy sites of Jerusalem, including the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. 'Nick and Tony both told me this was the most meaningful trip of their lives,' Rubin said. 'They feel a strong bond to the people of Israel. They are amazed by the bravery, the number of heroes, and very importantly, Israeli resilience. They cannot believe how determined Israelis are to wake up each day and not let anything get us down or break our spirit. They now know why we can’t be defeated.'

Biden pulls military aid from Israel to boost Hezbollah-infiltrat...	While the dollar amounts may seem modest, the timing of these last-minute moves by the administration has raised eyebrows in Washington. By Jewish Breaking News The Biden administration is pulling over $100 million in military support from Israel and Egypt to pump up Lebanon’s armed forces. A State Department memo obtained by the Associated Press reveals the White House quietly notified Congress on January 3 of its plans to divert $95 million in Egyptian military assistance and $7.5 million earmarked for Israel to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF). It’s a move the administration claims will help cement a shaky ceasefire deal hammered out last November between Hezbollah and Israel. 'U.S. security assistance to the LAF increases its capacity as the country’s only legitimate military force and defender of Lebanon’s territorial integrity, enables the LAF to prevent potential destabilization from ISIS and other terrorist groups, and enables the LAF to provide security both for the Lebanese people and for U.S. personnel,' the State Department’s memorandum reads. Under the terms of the 60-day ceasefire agreement, the IDF will gradually withdraw from southern Lebanon while Hezbollah forces pull back and dismantle their terror infrastructure in the region. In the interim, the LAF is to deploy roughly 6,000 troops to the area south of the Litani River. However, intelligence reports revealing Hezbollah’s lingering presence and the LAF’s failure to deploy adequate forces have prompted Israel to reconsider its withdrawal plans. While the dollar amounts may seem modest, the timing of these last-minute moves by the administration has raised eyebrows in Washington. Critics have long warned that Hezbollah’s tentacles reach deep into Lebanon’s military ranks. Reports have been surfacing that some LAF commanders are providing intelligence to Hezbollah. That doesn’t seem to bother Biden’s State Department, who insist the LAF serves as a 'counterweight' to the Iranian-backed terrorist group. 'U.S. support to the LAF reinforces the LAF as an important institutional counterweight to Hezbollah, which receives weapons, training, and financial support from Iran. 'The LAF continues to be an independent, non-sectarian institution in Lebanon and is respected across all sectors.' With Hezbollah’s influence looming large and tensions still simmering, Biden seems intent on undermining Israel’s security until his final day in office.

The average age of lung cancer diagnosis in 2021 was 70.8 years for Jewish men, 66.9 years for Arab men, 70.3 years for Jewish women, and 63.4 years for Arab women. By Pesach Benson, TPS A long-term study of lung cancer in Israel released on Wednesday by the Health Ministry found that smoking — both active and passive — remains the primary risk factor. 'The link between smoking and lung cancer is unequivocal. While trends in recent years suggest a decrease in mortality rates, continued efforts are needed to reduce smoking rates and prevent further lung cancer cases,' said Professor Lital Keinan-Boker, Director of the ministry’s National Center for Disease Control. The comprehensive report on lung cancer diagnoses and mortality by the ministry’s National Center for Disease Control, covered the years 1996-2021. In 2021, Israel saw 2,907 new cases of lung cancer, with a significant disparity between men and women. Men accounted for 60.3% of the diagnoses, while women made up 39.7%. Lung cancer claimed the lives of 1,875 patients that year. Of those cases, 80-90% were linked to tobacco use. Lung cancer rates are highest among individuals aged 55 and over, with only 8.3% of new diagnoses occurring in those under 55. Among various demographic groups, lung cancer diagnoses show stark variations in age and incidence. The data also revealed a steady decline in lung cancer incidence among Jewish men, with a 3.5% decrease in rates from 2016 to 2021. However, the incidence rate among Jewish women has remained relatively stable, staying low since 2014. In contrast, lung cancer rates among Arab men have remained stable over the same period, with the highest incidence observed in this group, while rates for Arab women remain the lowest across all population groups. The average age of lung cancer diagnosis in 2021 was 70.8 years for Jewish men, 66.9 years for Arab men, 70.3 years for Jewish women, and 63.4 years for Arab women. These figures illustrate the earlier onset of lung cancer among Arab populations, particularly Arab women, who have the lowest average age at diagnosis. In terms of survival rates, there has been some improvement over the years. The survival rate for Jewish men increased from 15.3% in 1996-2002 to 25.7% in 2010-2017. Similarly, survival rates for Jewish women rose from 23.3% to 38.1% in the same periods. For Arab men, the survival rate increased from 14.4% to 20.5%, while for Arab women, it went from 19.7% to 33.9%. Mortality rates have also shown signs of improvement, particularly among Jewish men, where mortality rates have decreased by 3.4% since 2011. Arab men saw a more significant decrease of 7.3%, while mortality rates among Jewish women dropped by 2% since 2016. Conversely, mortality rates for Arab women have remained stable. In an international context, Israel ranks 55th in lung cancer incidence and 78th in mortality rates compared to other countries, based on data from 185 regional and national cancer registries reported to the World Health Organization.

Israeli army reports surge in Haredi soldiers, 338 recruited in p...	In tandem with the recruitment push, the IDF completed the issuance of approximately 7,000 recruitment orders to non-commissioned officers from the Haredi sector, targeting future enlistment cycles. By Pesach Benson, TPS As draft exemptions for Israel’s Orthodox or Haredi community continue to create rifts in the governing coalition, the Israel Defense Forces said on Tuesday that 338 Haredim joined the military’s various service tracks in the past week. 'The IDF is working to integrate members of the Haredi sector into the various tracks, while expanding recruitment options by establishing new tracks and placement targets, while also refining and adapting existing tracks to recruits while maintaining their conditions and lifestyle,' the army said. Of the 338 new recruits, 211 enlisted as combat soldiers, while 127 took on roles as combat supporters. Among the highlights, the IDF successfully inducted the inaugural cohort of the 'Hashomonaim' Brigade and the maintenance system in northern Israel, as well as a second cohort for the Border Guard. Additionally, the 'Hashomonaim' Brigade’s combat track was extended to reservists in Phase B of its development. In tandem with the recruitment push, the IDF completed the issuance of approximately 7,000 recruitment orders to non-commissioned officers from the Haredi sector, targeting future enlistment cycles. This achievement fulfills the recruitment order objectives set by the Minister of Defense for this phase of the year, complementing 3,000 recruitment orders issued earlier in 2024. The latest recruitment figures for Haredi combat roles included 70 recruits for the Netzah Yehuda Battalion, 19 recruits for the 'Tomer' Company, 19 recruits for the 'Arrow' Company, 11 recruits for the Air Force’s 'Negev' Company, 35 recruits for the Border Police, and 57 recruits for the 'Hashomonaim' Brigade. Recruitment drives are set to continue throughout the month, with additional Haredi enlistments expected. The military began making plans to draft yeshiva students after Israel’s High Court of Justice ruled in June that exemptions for the Haredi community were illegal. The issue has not been resolved and is contributing to a coalition crisis that forced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to leave the hospital over the advice of his doctors to cast his vote on government legislation on Tuesday. Military service is compulsory for all Israeli citizens. However, Israel’s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, and the country’s leading rabbis agreed to a status quo that deferred military service for Haredi men studying in yeshivot, or religious institutions. At the time, no more than several hundred men were studying in yeshivot. However, the Orthodox community has grown significantly since Israel’s founding. In January 2023, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported that Haredim are Israel’s fastest-growing community and projected it would constitute 16% of the population by the end of the decade. According to the Israel Democracy Institute, the number of yeshiva students exceeded 138,000 in 2021. A recent survey found that the Israeli public is shifting decisively in favor of integrating Orthodox Jews into military service. The Israel Democracy Institute found that only 9% of Israelis support the current arrangement exempting Haredim from military service, a steep decline from 22% ten months earlier.

Bodies of hostages Youssef and Hamza Ziyadne retrieved from Gaza	The IDF and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) confirmed that Youssef’s remains were found in a tunnel in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. By JNS Israel Defense Forces troops located the bodies of hostages Youssef and Hamza Ziyadne during military operations in the Gaza Strip, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed on Wednesday evening. In a statement shared by the Defense Ministry, Katz expressed his 'deep condolences to the Ziyadne family upon the discovery of the bodies of Youssef and Hamza, who were kidnapped by Hamas murderers on Oct. 7 and were rescued in a heroic operation by our heroic soldiers. 'We continue to do everything to fulfill our supreme moral obligation—the return of all the hostages, living and dead, to Israeli soil,' he added. The IDF and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) confirmed that Youssef’s remains were found in a tunnel in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. The statement did not immediately confirm Hamza’s death, though it said that the findings in the tunnel raised 'serious concerns' for his life. Yesterday, the IDF and ISA located and recovered the body of the hostage Youssef Ziyadne from an underground tunnel in the area of Rafah in Gaza, and returned his body to Israel. Youssef, 53, was the father of 19 children and lived in Rahat. Youssef was abducted on Oct. 7, 2023… pic.twitter.com/0WK6kl80Ks &mdash; Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) January 8, 2025 'Our hearts ache,' Ali Ziyadne, Youssef’s brother, told Israel’s Ynet news outlet. He added, 'We wanted them to return to our family alive, but unfortunately they returned dead. Aisha and her brother Bilal were waiting to embrace them. This is a difficult and shocking disaster.' Youssef Ziyadne, 53, and his children Hamza, 22, Bilal, 18, and Aisha, 17, residents of the Israeli Bedouin community of Rahat, were abducted by Palestinian Hamas terrorists during the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre while they were working in Kibbutz Holit near the border with Gaza. Bilal and Aisha were released as part of the November 2023 ceasefire agreement between Jerusalem and Hamas after 55 days in captivity. On Oct. 7, 2023, 25 residents of Rahat, the largest Muslim Bedouin city in Israel’s Negev desert, headed to Gaza border communities Kibbutz Holit and Kibbutz Sufa to work and did not return. They were among the 1,200 people killed by Hamas during its invasion of Israel that morning. Thousands more were wounded, and more than 250 were taken back to the Strip as hostages, including six Bedouins. According to Israeli estimates, there are 98 hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza, including 94 abducted during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of the 251 hostages taken on Oct. 7, 157 have been returned or rescued, and Hamas is believed to be holding 36 bodies, 34 of them taken on Oct. 7 and the remaining two being IDF soldiers Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul, who were kidnapped in 2014.

Ireland accuses Israel of genocide, joining ICJ case	Dublin signs on to Gaza genocide case in the International Court of Justice, as part of petition first launched by South Africa. By World Israel News Staff Ireland signed on to South Africa’s petition to the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in the Gaza Strip, the court announced Tuesday. The case was first launched in December, 2023, after South Africa’s government filed a brief with the United Nations court, calling for an investigation into Israel’s handling of the war in the Gaza Strip. Since then, a number of other countries, including Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Maldives, Chile, Spain, Turkey, and Bolivia have signed onto the petition. The Palestinian Authority has also signed the petition, calling on the ICJ to intervene. On Monday, Dublin joined the case, invoking Article 63 of the court’s statue, while adding no new allegations against Israel. Ireland did offer a unique legal reasoning for the petition, however, telling the court that the definition of genocide, the 'intent to destroy, in whole or in part' of a population, could be met if actions could be reasonably perceived as having such a goal in mind. 'In Ireland's view, specific intent can also be inferred in any case where a reasonable person would have foreseen that the natural and probable consequence of the acts of the perpetrator was to so destroy or contribute to destruction of the protected group,' Dublin wrote to the court. 'Ireland respectfully submits that the perpetrator does not need to have, as his or her purpose, the commission of the crime of genocide when committing any one or more of the material elements of the crime.' Dublin has for almost a year signaled its intention to join onto South Africa’s petition, first announcing its plans to do so last March. The announcement comes as diplomatic relations between Israel and Ireland hit their nadir, after Jerusalem shuttered its embassy in Dublin last month. The decision came after the Irish cabinet voted to join South Africa’s ICJ case against Israel. 'The antisemitic actions and rhetoric that Ireland is taking against Israel are based on delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state and on double standards,' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said in December. 'Ireland has crossed all red lines in its relationship with Israel. Israel will invest its resources in promoting bilateral relations with the countries of the world according to priorities that are also derived from the attitude of the various countries towards it.'

Hostages’ families petition High Court to force a deal with Hamas	By not agreeing to Hamas' demands, the government is violating their loved ones’ basic and state-guaranteed rights, 112 signatories said. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A group of 112 freed hostages and families of those still in Hamas captivity in Gaza petitioned the High Court of Justice Tuesday to try to force the government to make a deal with the terrorist organization. 'The goal is to illustrate that the State of Israel is deviating from protecting the basic rights of the citizens who are being held there, and it has been doing this for the last 15 months,' Renana Guma told Kan Reshet Bet. Guma’s children, Or and Gil, were freed in the only hostage deal to date in November 2023, but their father Yair was murdered and his body is being held among a mix of 100 living and dead hostages. 'In fact, the state is violating two Basic Laws,' she said. One is the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, which states that every human being is entitled to protection of his life, body and freedom. The other is the Nation-State Law, which has a clause stating that 'The state shall strive to ensure the safety of its citizens who are in distress and captivity because of their citizenship.' The petitioners accuse the government, and especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, of violating their loved ones’ basic constitutional rights by 'refus[ing] to agree to an arrangement for the release of the abductees held in the Gaza Strip' that includes bowing to Hamas’ demand to stop the war and withdraw the IDF from the coastal enclave. They are seeking an urgent judicial order to the government to defend how its non-action regarding the hostages is not violating the Basic Laws. Barak Medina, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, explained to Kan that although the court does not have the authority or ability to dictate to the government what policy to adopt, it does have the power to oblige it to provide explanations to the public and prove that it has an organized policy. But one of the court’s roles, he said, is to distinguish 'whether something the government or the Knesset legislature does violates human rights or does not violate them.' He also charged that 'There is not even a single government decision on the conditions under which a deal will take place. The prime minister decides alone, constantly changing the negotiating team's instructions, without anyone knowing what the logic is and without considering the heads of the security establishment, without there being an orderly discussion.' The 'proper procedure,' he said, would be to hear the opinions of all the security authorities and receive a list of 'the advantages and disadvantages of a deal and the consequences of not making a deal, and sets some parameters, something minimal.' Not all the hostage families believe in pressuring the government, believing instead that the pressure must be directed at those holding the hostages. The Tikva Forum repeated its longstanding demand Tuesday that that the Israeli government and the IDF 'immediately present a list of clear steps that will be taken to strike the Hamas terrorist organization to the point that it begs to release all the hostages.' These families are also firmly opposed to any agreements that do not result in the release of all the hostages together. Partial deals, they said, 'undermine the ability to return the remaining hostages, while legitimizing and empowering Hamas.' Even the very existence of negotiations, they said, 'strengthens the terror organization and gives it a sense of control and governance.'

IDF will keep killing terrorists until Hamas frees hostages, says...	We won't stop' - IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi tells Israeli army officers in Gaza that Israel's military operations in the Strip are meant to pressure Hamas into freeing Israeli hostages. By World Israel News Staff Israel is using its continuing military operation in the Gaza Strip to bring pressure to bear on the Hamas terror organization, with the aim of forcing it to release the remaining 100 captives held in the coastal enclave, the IDF's top officer said Tuesday. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi met with Israeli officers operating in the northern Gaza city of Jabalia on Tuesday. During his visit, Halevi held a situational assessment with the Southern Command Chief, Major General Yaron Finkelman, the 162nd Division Commander, Brigadier General Itzik Cohen, and a number of other senior IDF officers commanding forces in the Gaza Strip. Israel, Halevi told the officers, is working to use military force to bring Hamas 'to the point where it will understand that it needs to [release] all the hostages.' 'I look at the situation that Hamas is in, they see every day what you are doing to them and they understand that this thing is close to being unbearable.' 'And I am telling you that we will not stop. We will bring them to the point where they will understand that they need to release all the hostages, otherwise the very professional work you are doing will continue and continue, and it means more prisoners and more dead terrorists. And I know you are doing everything possible to minimize casualties on our side.' The comments came amid mixed signals regarding the status of hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar. Various Arabic media outlets have reported this week that the two sides have made progress in the negotiations. However, senior Hamas spokesman and politburo member Osama Hamdan told a press conference in Algeria Tuesday that the terror group will not compromise on any of its core demands, insisting on the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and a complete end to the war. Israel has already rejected a complete pullout from Gaza, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will continue fighting the war until it has achieved all of its objectives, including the complete dismantling of the Hamas terror organization.

Amnesty International suspends Israeli branch for two years	The Israeli branch, which is a legally independent organization, rejected the claims that Jerusalem is perpetrating genocide in the Strip. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Amnesty International’s international board has suspended its Israel branch for two years, starting immediately, the nonprofit told JNS on Tuesday. The nonprofit’s board 'considered Amnesty Israel’s failure to align itself fully with Amnesty International research and positions, and its public discrediting of Amnesty’s research undermining well-investigated findings for several years,' a spokesperson told JNS. The Amnesty board also took the decision 'due to evidence of endemic anti-Palestinian racism within Amnesty Israel, which violates core human rights principles and Amnesty values,' the spokesperson claimed. 'Anti-Palestinian racism within Amnesty Israel has been denounced by a number of board members of Amnesty Israel since 2021, resulting in their resignations.' 'They have also taken to the media and social media to reject and condemn anti-Palestinian racism within Amnesty International Israel and beyond,' the spokesperson added. Earlier on Tuesday, a staff member at Amnesty’s Israel branch, which was founded in 1964 and is one of the nonprofit’s oldest chapters, confirmed the suspension to JNS and denied that the Tel Aviv-based chapter’s actions were racist against Palestinians. The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noted that Amnesty Israel consults with Arab and Jewish staffers about its statements and reports. The source didn’t say how Amnesty’s decision would affect the Tel Aviv-based organization’s day-to-day operations. Amnesty Israel has reportedly been dissatisfied with its parent body’s lack of concern for Jewish terror victims. On Dec. 5, Amnesty released the 296-page report 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman,' noting 'Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.' The report accused Israel Defense Forces soldiers of 'prohibited acts under the Genocide Convention—namely killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm and deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part.' The Israeli branch, which is a legally independent organization, rejected the claims that Jerusalem is perpetrating genocide in the Strip. 'Our careful analysis does not find that the findings meet the definition of genocide, as carefully formulated in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,' it stated. In 2022, Amnesty called Jerusalem’s treatment of Palestinian Arabs 'apartheid,' a conclusion that staff members of Amnesty Israel called 'problematic,' 'flawed' and at risk of producing 'an adverse effect.' Officials in Jerusalem have previously said that Amnesty Israel has violated anti-boycott legislation by campaigning for arms embargoes and promoting a blacklist of Jewish villages in Judea and Samaria. Last year, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich instructed the Israeli Tax Authority to launch a formal probe into tax benefits that the local Amnesty branch enjoys under Israeli law. Smotrich’s office said it also took issue with the fact that 80% of the organization’s budget came from Amnesty’s global headquarters, which it said raised questions about its legal independence.

Report: Latest hostage deal proposal making progress, includes 6-...	Pro-Hezbollah outlet in Lebanon reports that talks in Qatar are making progress with new proposal under which Israel would agree to 6-8 week ceasefire, in exchange for comprehensive list of hostages and their condition. By World Israel News Staff A Lebanese newspaper aligned with the pro-Iranian terror group Hezbollah reported Wednesday that hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar are making progress towards a deal based on a proposal under which Israel would agree to an extended ceasefire in exchange for a complete list of all living hostages held in the Gaza Strip. According to the report published by Al-Akhbar Wednesday morning, ceasefire talks in Qatar are now focused on a proposed six-to-eight week truce in the Gaza Strip. During the ceasefire, Hamas will gather information on the condition of all Israeli captives still held by its operatives and by other terrorist groups in Gaza, and transfer a list of living hostages to Israel. In addition, Hamas will send a list of all hostages who are confirmed as having died in captivity. The report cited Egyptian officials who said that only hostages whose remains have been located will be included on the list. As part of the agreement, Israel would ensure a massive increase in the quantity of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip during the ceasefire. Furthermore, Gaza's medical system would undergo a major upgrade during the truce. The report claimed that negotiators have set aside the question of post-war control of the Gaza Strip for the time being. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied the report, calling it 'absolutely false.' In a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office, Netanyahu derided the report as 'psychological warfare' against Israelis. 'The report in the Arab media about a pause of a number of weeks in the war in exchange for a list of hostages' names is absolutely false and an additional part of the psychological warfare that Hamas is trying to use on the hostages' families and the citizens of Israel.' 'The State of Israel will continue to work relentlessly, around the clock, to bring all of our hostages back home.'

Report details UNRWA’s ‘unholy alliance’ with Hamas, Islamic Jiha...	More than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA in June, accusing the agency of 'aiding and abetting' the terror group. By Pesach Benson, TPS A United Nations watchdog organization accused the embattled UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees of having an 'unholy alliance' with the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror groups in a report released on Tuesday. The report comes as Israeli legislation blacklisting the agency is due to go into effect later in January. The Geneva-based UN Watch alleges that senior UNRWA officials routinely engage with terror groups, describing each other as 'partners' and praising their 'cooperation.' The 55-page report accuses Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA’s Commissioner-General, and his colleagues of enabling infiltration by Hamas and other terror groups. It states that Hamas and Islamic Jihad influenced UNRWA policies, indoctrinated Palestinian children through agency schools, and established military infrastructure near UNRWA’s Gaza facilities. 'UNRWA isn’t just a bystander in the Arab-Israeli conflict – it’s a primary enabler,' observes Hillel Neuer, Executive Director of UN Watch. 'By allowing terrorists to infiltrate its ranks and incite violence, UNRWA isn’t promoting peace, they’re perpetuating hatred and war,' said UN Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer. According to the report, over 10% of UNRWA’s senior educators in Gaza are members of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Israeli authorities have also alleged that hundreds of UNRWA’s 13,000 Gazan employees, including teachers, are active members of Hamas. The report further claims that UNRWA complied with demands from terror groups, such as blocking biometric identification systems aimed at ensuring accurate refugee counts, resisting the adoption of ethics codes protecting LGBTQ rights, and failing to suspend employees who breached neutrality policies. The UN Watch report highlighted a May 2024 meeting in Beirut where Lazzarini reportedly reached an agreement with terror groups. Under this agreement, Hamas leader Fathi al-Sharif was allowed to remain the principal of a major UNRWA school and head of its teachers’ union despite his history of glorifying terrorist attacks. Al-Sharif’s suspension occurred only after a formal government complaint in early 2024. He was later killed by Israeli forces on Sept. 30, 2024. Hamas subsequently confirmed his leadership role and praised his 'jihadi education.' Another case involves Leni Stenseth, a former UNRWA deputy commissioner-general, who visited Gaza in June 2021 to meet Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader. This visit came after Hamas declared Matthias Schmale, then Gaza director of UNRWA, persona non grata for acknowledging the precision of Israeli strikes during the May 2021 conflict. Stenseth reportedly removed Schmale from his post and thanked Sinwar for his 'positivity' in facilitating UNRWA’s work. Former UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl met Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders in 2017, fostering a secretive 'partnership' and allowing them to influence UNRWA decisions. After resigning amid scandal in 2019, he controversially became head of the International Red Cross, drawing U.S. Senate protests. In July, Israel gave the UN the names of around 100 UNRWA personnel who participated in the attack, held hostages, or were members of Hamas. However, the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services, which investigates mismanagement, fraud, corruption, and other misconduct, only probed 19 personnel. The OIOS did not indicate why it did not investigate the dozens of other workers. Of the 19 staffers who were investigated, the OIOS said nine 'may have been involved in the armed attacks' and that 'the employment of these individuals will be terminated in the interests of the Agency.' According to the report, 'The fact that Lazzarini has spent the last 14 months since October 7, 2023, shirking any responsibility by UNRWA for the atrocities perpetrated against Israelis by Hamas terrorists, including the involvement of UNRWA employees in those atrocities and in the ongoing hostilities in Gaza, shows that he is more focused on preserving UNRWA’s image than on ensuring its neutrality and independence.' Israeli Moves to Shut Down UNRWA In October, the Knesset passed legislation, which took effect later in January, stripping UNRWA of its diplomatic immunity and barring Israeli officials from cooperating with the agency. In November, Israel withdrew its diplomatic recognition of UNRWA. More than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA in June, accusing the agency of 'aiding and abetting' the terror group. According to the suit, the lead plaintiff, 84-year-old Ditza Heiman of Kibbutz Nir Oz, was held captive for seven weeks in the home of a Palestinian man who said he was a UNRWA teacher at a boy’s school. The suit also alleges that UNRWA enacted an employee payment scheme to benefit Hamas in violation of UN protocols. Israel’s largest bank froze UNRWA’s account in February over suspicious financial transfers that the agency failed to adequately explain. That same month, Israeli forces discovered a Hamas complex located directly under the UNRWA’s Gaza City headquarters and connected directly to the agency’s electricity system. The facility included numerous computer servers belonging to the terror group. In May, UNRWA was ordered to vacate its Jerusalem offices in May over lease violations. Palestinian refugees are the only refugee population with its own dedicated UN agency. The rest of the world’s refugees fall under the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Petition urges The Jerusalem Post to nix ‘West Bank’ in reporting...	The appeal was launched following a tweet against the newspaper by a right-wing Israeli parliamentarian in the wake of Monday’s shooting attack by the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq near Kedumim. By JNS A group of conservative Jewish and Christian leaders has launched a public petition urging The Jerusalem Post to stop using the term West Bank in reporting on Israel’s biblical heartland and to call it by its historic name of Judea and Samaria. 'As Israel’s oldest English newspaper when it was called ‘The Palestine Post,’ The Jerusalem Post holds significant influence in shaping public opinion, influencing policies and defining global narratives,' the petition addressed to Eli Azur, the media outlet’s owner, and Zvika Klein, its editor-in-chief, stated. 'Your words and your headlines matter as Israel fights on the front lines and the front pages of media outlets around the globe.' The appeal was launched following a tweet against the newspaper by a right-wing Israeli parliamentarian in the wake of Monday’s shooting attack by the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq near Kedumim. 'It’s heartbreaking enough that Jewish blood is flowing needlessly in our biblical heartland,' MK Ohad Tal from Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s party wrote on X. 'It’s time for you to join hundreds of media outlets in calling our homeland by its correct name, ‘Judea and Samaria.’ Only the truth will help us overcome our enemies’ murders and lies.' The attack killed three Israelis, including two women in their 70s and an Israeli police officer who was gunned down in his car in front of his young son. The petition to The Jerusalem Post further stated that by 'referring to today’s attack in Kedumim, which killed three and injured eight as occurring in the ‘West Bank,’ your headline leads credence to those delegitimizing Israel.' Troy Miller, president of the National Religious Broadcasters, the largest association of Christian media broadcasters, urged association members during their annual convention in February 2024 to cease using the term 'West Bank' when reporting about Israel’s biblical heartland. 'Words matter in how we control the conversation and the language,' Miller said. 'Younger Christians don’t understand that the West Bank is within the biblical boundaries of Israel.'

Defeating Hamas could take 2-3 years, thinktank warns	Two decades of gathering weapons and building tunnels cannot be gotten rid of so quickly, says Dr. Eitan Shamir of the BESA Center. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The final military defeat of Hamas could take a few years, considering the time it has had to build its terror infrastructure, the director of a Middle East policy-oriented thinktank told The Media Line Wednesday. 'Hamas had over twenty years to accumulate a massive amount of firepower, dispersing it in many areas, including in its widespread underground tunnel network,' said Dr. Eitan Shamir, director of Bar Ilan University’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies (BESA Center). 'Combined with other terrorist organizations, such as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), it had approximately 30,000 fighters. This could take two to three years to get rid of.' The IDF said more than six months ago that it had destroyed or completely degraded all of Hamas’ 24 military brigades. However, according to a recent Channel 12 report, the two groups have managed to recruit new men and now have between 20,000 to 23,000 fighters. Although the new recruits are barely trained in comparison to their predecessors, the army still has to root them out in major military operations, going back into places where it had already fought once or twice before. For example, in the just-concluded round in the northern part of the Strip, the IDF said more than 300 terrorists were killed. The Israeli army’s death toll in the ground offensive so far in Gaza stands at 398, with three soldiers losing their lives in the last two days. According to Yoni Ben Menachem, a Middle East expert from the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, a think tank specializing in public and foreign policy, Hamas’ tunnel network is also a big threat that will take time to defeat. 'There is an estimated 40% of the tunnels still remaining, hundreds of kilometers of tunnels the Israeli intelligence was not aware of,' he told The Media Line. 'There are still very long tunnels that Israel has yet to have located, some of them with hostages inside,' he noted. 'This requires a very big operation and a massive amount of explosives that Israel currently does not possess.' The IDF has estimated that there are up to 450 miles of tunnels in the Strip, which is only some 140 square miles in size. 25-mile-long Gaza Strip. It has concentrated on destroying the largest and most strategically important ones, including those closest to the border with Israel, while damaging key points in others to render them unusable. Whether they stay inoperable is questionable, however, as a Channel 12 report in July cited an IDF assessment that the terrorists had managed to repair 'many' tunnels in Khan Yunis, for example. 'Israel does not have enough forces at this point to subdue Hamas both militarily and in its ability to govern Gaza,' Ben Menachem added. 'In order to do that, Israel needs to occupy the entire Gaza Strip and announce it is enforcing temporary military administration.' This is the preferred option of the more right-wing members of the current coalition. The outgoing Biden administration had flatly refused to endorse such a plan, desiring that a 'reformed' Palestinian Authority (PA) take over on 'the day after.' Considering the PA’s ongoing encouragement of terrorism, this idea has been shot down several times by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has yet to produce any concrete proposals regarding the governance of the Gaza Strip after the war’s goal of Hamas’ 'total defeat' is achieved.

Freed terrorist re-arrested for planning another attack	Moataz Berri served just three years in an Israeli military prison before his release. By World Israel News Staff A convicted terrorist released from an Israeli prison was recently arrested for planning an additional terror attack, Channel 14 News reported on Wednesday. In September 2020, Moataz Berri was arrested moments before carrying out an attack against Israeli civilians. Berri, a 24-year-old from the terror hotbed of Qalqilya, had illegally infiltrated Israel from PA-controlled territory. He was detained by security forces in the central city of Rosh HaAyin, where he was found to be in possession of a loaded gun. The terrorist left behind a 'martyrdom letter,' and admitted during an interrogation that he planned to shoot Israeli civilians. According to his testimony in military court, Berri wandered around Rosh HaAyin searching for victims for nearly two hours. He told the judges that he had planned to shoot an Orthodox Jewish man he encountered, but changed his mind after noticing that the potential victim had a baby in his vehicle. Berri claimed that he had already decided not to carry out the attack when he was arrested. In 2022, the court acquitted Berri of attempted murder charges, due to his expression of remorse for his actions. 'We welcome the court's decision to acquit the defendant. This is an important decision that sends a clear message to' potential terrorists, Berri's attorney, Merav Khory, said in a media statement at the time. The ruling 'sends a message that says 'it is never too late'' to 'stop their actions and save innocent lives.' He was convicted on less serious charges, and served just three years in an Israeli military prison before being freed. In October 2024, Berri was re-arrested by intelligence and security agencies after an investigation revealed he was planning to carry out another attack. According to the report, Berri had been in communication via 'encrypted channels' with Hamas operatives in Turkey. Berri said during his interrogation that he was instructed by his handlers to retrieve weapons, which had been buried in a field near the PA-controlled city of Tulkarem. Investigators found an M-16 assault rifle and two handguns at the site.

Ex-IDF soldier lands in Israel after fleeing Brazil ‘war crimes’ ...	We are all thrilled that he returned home safely,' said Itzik Vagdani, the soldier's father. By World Israel News Staff A former Israeli soldier who fled Brazil after a local court ordered police to investigate him on war crimes charges has landed safely in Israel, Hebrew-language media reported on Wednesday morning. Yuval Vagdani was targeted by the pro-Hamas Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) while traveling in Brazil, following his recent release from mandatory military service. The HRF stalks the social media profiles of current and former Israel soldiers, urging local authorities to arrest them when they travel abroad. Vagdani, who served in a unit which demolished homes used as Hamas terror assets, was forced to leave Brazil after the HRF submitted a 500-page complaint to a federal court. The documents included images that Vagdani had posted on his social media accounts of military activities in the Strip, which were used by the HRF to claim he he was complicit in 'genocide.' A Brazilian federal court instructed police to launch a probe of Vagdani, triggering According to Hebrew-language media reports, Israel's Foreign Ministry assisted Vagdani in immediately reaching Argentina. From there, he flew to Miami, in the U.S., and then back to Israel. 'We are all thrilled that he returned home safely,' said Itzik Vagdani, the soldier's father. 'Yuval is a survivor of the Nova massacre, and now that he has returned home, he has told his family that he will no longer upload videos about the activities he carried out in the Gaza Strip.' Itzik Vagdani added that his son 'will never return to Brazil again. He will learn from the mistakes he made. The main thing is that he has now returned to Israel and we are all happy that everything is behind us.' The incident has sparked serious concerns among Israeli leadership that former and active duty IDF soldiers could potentially be arrested while traveling abroad. According to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Ynet, soldiers are believed to be most at risk of being detained or prosecuted in Ireland, Brazil, Spain, Belgium, and South Africa.

‘God, save me’ – Former hostage recalls Hamas abduction	We hid under the bed, but then I heard ‘Allahu Akbar,’' said Sapir Cohen, recounting terrifying kidnapping by Hamas terrorists. By World Israel News Staff A former hostage who was kidnapped by the Hamas terror group and held captive in the Gaza Strip spoke about her terrifying ordeal in a recent interview. The weekend of October 7th, Sapir Cohen and her boyfriend Alexander (Sasha) Trufanov were visiting his parents in Kibbutz Nahal Oz. Prior to the visit, Trufanov had expressed reservations about traveling to the kibbutz, but Cohen convinced him to go anyway, she told the TBN Israel YouTube channel. The pair, who were staying in a separate kibbutz house near the Trufanov family home, were awakened on October 7th by nonstop air raid sirens. Then, Cohen said, Trufanov received a WhatsApp message from his mother that there were terrorists who had infiltrated the kibbutz. 'We hid under the bed, but then I heard ‘Allahu Akbar,’ I heard hundreds of terrorists storming houses, I heard things explode, the screams of the terrorists, the screams of the people killed by them, and I heard them come closer and closer to us. They were shooting everywhere, at everyone,' Cohen said. She prayed for God to save her, she said. Then, terrorists burst into the room, separating her from Trufanov. They were both abducted to Gaza. Cohen recounted crowds of civilians who jeered and attempted to beat her, as she was taken into the Strip on a motorcycle. Once in Gaza, Cohen was held alongside other captives who had been kidnapped during the massacres. 'I remember that I saw the other hostages, that one of them just laid down and he closed his eyes, he doesn’t want to be a part of this reality,' Cohen told TBN. 'I saw a young girl that was shaking, and I saw people that all their families were in the kibbutz on that day and they didn’t know what happened to their children, to their parents.' Cohen said that she once again prayed for God to save her, so that she could help support other hostages. After 55 days in captivity, Cohen was freed during a ceasefire. Troufanov is still held in the Strip. His mother, Yelena, and grandmother, Irina, who were also kidnapped, were released in the same deal as Cohen. His father, Vitali, was murdered on October 7th.

Congress to vote on bill sanctioning ICC over Netanyahu arrest wa...	After Republicans take control of the Senate, Congress set to again take up legislation sanctioning the International Criminal Court and its chief prosecutor, over arrest warrants issued for Israeli prime minister, ex-defense chief. By World Israel News Staff Congressional Republicans signaled Tuesday that they will renew their efforts to impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its chief prosecutor, Karim Kahn, after the previous attempt to do so was stymied by the Senate's Democratic leadership last year. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (LA-R) announced Tuesday that the lower chamber of Congress would vote on a sanctions bill later this week. 'This week, the House will vote to impose sanctions on ICC officials and put the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, back in his place,' Johnson said. The House Speaker castigated the ICC for its decision to issue arrest warrants for ISraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant last year for their involvement in the war against the Hamas terror organization in Gaza. Khan 'does not have jurisdiction over Israel or the United States, and it is outrageous that they’re issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant,' Johnson continued. 'The ICC is actually equating Israel and Hamas, as even as Hamas still holds Israelis and American hostages. It is just absurd.' 'The House will not tolerate rogue actors who circumvent international law to attack Israel and threaten America. We won’t do it.' In June, the House voted in favor of a bill imposing sanctions on the ICC, with the backing of dozens of Democratic lawmakers. The measure was shelved in the Democratic-controlled Senate, however. Now, with Republicans controlling 52 seats in the Senate - rising to 53 once Senator-elect Jim Justice completes his term as West Virginia Governor - Majority Leader John Thune (SD-R) has vowed to advance the sanctions bill. 'If the ICC and its prosecutor do not reverse their outrageous and unlawful actions to pursue arrest warrants against Israeli officials, the Senate should immediately pass sanctions legislation, as the House has already done on a bipartisan basis,' Thune tweeted on November 17th, after Republicans secured a majority in the Senate, days after he won a leadership vote in GOP's Senate caucus, putting him on course to become Majority Leader. The Washington Free Beacon has reported that the House will vote on the legislation this Thursday. In parallel to the efforts in Congress, President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly planning to target the ICC with executive orders sanctioning the court's top officials. While the Biden administration rejected the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, it fell short of taking punitive steps against the court.

‘Not good for Hamas’ – Trump issues ultimatum as envoy hints host...	Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, joins the president-elect at a press conference, claiming that 'a lot of progress' is being made in hostage deal talks in Doha, as inauguration day approaches. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump appeared alongside his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida Tuesday, reiterating his warning to the Hamas terror organization that there will be 'hell to pay' if the remaining 100 hostages are not released by inauguration day on January 20th. 'If those hostages aren’t back … by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East — and it will not be good for Hamas and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone,' Trump said. 'All hell will break out. I don’t have to say anymore, but that’s what it is.' 'They should have given them back a long time ago, [and] they should have never taken them. There should have never been the attack on October 7th. People forget that. But there was, and many people are killed - they're no longer hostages.' 'If the deal isn't done before I take office, which is now gonna be two weeks, all hell will break out in the Middle East.' Trump's comments echoed similar remarks made a day earlier, when Trump told conservative pundit and radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt that 'there will be hell to pay' if Hamas does not release all hostages by January 20th. 'Those hostages have to get out. They have to get out now.' At Tuesday's press conference, Witkoff appeared to be optimistic regarding the prospects for achieving a hostage deal by inauguration day. 'Well, I think we're making a lot of progress, and I don't want to say too much because I think they're doing a really good job back in Doha,' Witkoff said. 'I think that we've had some really great progress, and I'm really hopeful that by the inaugural, we'll have some good things to announce on behalf of the president.'

Rabbi Moshe Sasonkin told Ynet that IDF officials informed him that Hezbollah had collected information about him, including where he lived and even details about his car. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An IDF operation in Southern Lebanon uncovered documents outlining Hezbollah's plans to invade northern Israel, and one of the targets was the Chabad House in Metula, Ynet reports. Rabbi Moshe Sasonkin told Ynet that IDF officials informed him that Hezbollah had collected information about him, including where he lived and even details about his car. The plans to invade northern Israel were revealed when the IDF targeted a Hezbollah bunker in the village of village of Kfar Kila. In addition to discovering stockpiles of weapons, they found documents describing in detail plans to invade Metula and other communities in northern Israel. In September, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari confirmed that the IDF had eliminated Radwan Force Commander Ibrahim Aqil who had plans to capture the Galilee. Rabbi Sasonkin told the publication Kfar Chabad, 'A senior official revealed to me that after IDF forces entered the village of Kila, they found there, among other things, a document that contained very detailed plans for a massacre similar to October 7, which only by the grace of God did not come to fruition.' He added, 'Among the intelligence information found in the underground bunkers of Hezbollah terrorists, there was a list of the most important people in Metula, and our house also 'deserved' to be marked as a terrorist target. This is a very detailed document, which even accurately describes our vehicle.' Rabbi Sasonkin expressed hope that Israeli evacuees could return to their homes in the north but also described the scale to which Hezbollah was embedded, even in ordinary Lebanese homes right across the border from Israel. He said, 'The village of Kila and in many other Shiite villages and settlements in the vicinity, almost every house, even if it seems like the residence of an 'innocent' family - contained a cache of weapons, including RPG missiles and other deadly weapons.' Rabbi Sasonkin added, 'There is no logical explanation why they did not ultimately carry out the diabolical plan, after that. It was prepared in detail. The only explanation is a great miracle that happened to us and the mercy of God.'

Jerusalem court OKs seizure of $5.5 million in PA funds by relati...	Attorney Asher Stub, whose Justice for Terror Victims NGO helped write the bill on which the request was based, represented the Yaniv family. By JNS The Jerusalem District Court recently approved the seizure of 20 million shekels ($5.5 million) in Palestinian Authority funds by the relatives of slain brothers Hallel and Yagel Yaniv, who were murdered by an Arab terrorist in Samaria almost two years ago, Ynet reported on Tuesday. The suit was filed under the 'Compensation for Terror Victims Law,' passed by the Knesset in March. The law requires courts to award punitive damages of at least 10 million shekels per fatal casualty. To ease the collection of potential punitive awards by victims and their families, court judgments may be enforced against any property of the defendant, including any property seized or frozen by the State of Israel. Under agreements signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1990s, Israel collects taxes and customs duties on behalf of the P.A. 'Nothing can bring our loved ones back to us, and nothing will put our mind at ease,' Shalom Yaniv, father of the two terror victims, told Ynet. 'At the same time, the move to seize the P.A.’s funds is the beginning of doing justice to us as a family, as well as to the victims of terrorism.' 'This is a just and correct move,' Yaniv continued. 'Every family that was harmed by a terrorist incident should sue to convey the message that those who finance terror will also pay on an economic level. In addition, the State of Israel must engage in the expulsion of terrorists.' Attorney Asher Stub, whose Justice for Terror Victims NGO helped write the bill on which the request was based, represented the Yaniv family. 'The Compensation for Terror Victims Law, which was enacted this year in the Knesset at our initiative, will result in billions of shekels in compensation for the families of terror victims,' stated Stub. 'The Yaniv family’s lawsuit achieves the dual goal of providing adequate compensation to the family and harming the economic infrastructure that finances and encourages terrorist attacks,' the attorney added. Hallel Menachem, 21, and Yagel Yaakov Yaniv, 19, from the Samaria village of Har Bracha, were hit by terrorist gunfire during a traffic jam in the nearby hostile Palestinian community of Huwara on Feb. 26, 2023. The Israel Defense Forces said a terrorist drove to the Einabus junction and opened fire on an Israeli vehicle. The Yaniv brothers were evacuated to the hospital for treatment, where the two were pronounced dead. Under the P.A.’s 'pay for slay' policy, Ramallah disburses monthly stipends to convicted terrorists and the families of slain terrorists. The so-called Martyrs’ Fund is enshrined in P.A. law, granting terrorists or their next of kin the right to receive payments as long as they live. In October, attorneys for some 250 Israelis affected by Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre filed a record-breaking lawsuit against the Palestinian Authority, citing its support for terrorism through pay for slay. The terrorism victims and families of those killed during the Oct. 7 attacks, represented by the Jerusalem-based Arbus, Kedem, Tzur law firm, demanded 1.75 billion shekels ($462 million) in compensation. The claim came on top of a 210 million shekel ($55 million) lawsuit filed some three months earlier with the Jerusalem District Court by dozens of Israelis whose relatives were killed in recent years, including in the ax attack in Elad on Independence Day in 2022 and the Oct. 7 slaughter.

IDF reports it is battling newly recruited Hamas terrorists in Ga...	The source emphasized that there has been a notable decline in the quality of its forces. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As the IDF has returned to northern Gaza to battle Hamas, Israel's military admits that many of the terrorists they are fighting are new recruits. The aim of the renewed campaign in northern Gaza is to eliminate terrorist infrastructure. Galai Tzahal (IDF Radio) Military correspondent Doron Kadosh reported that many of the Hamas terrorists soldiers are fighting against have been recruited since the war. Officers said the goal of the current operation is to destroy Hamas's infrastructure to make additional missions unnecessary. Kadosh said, 'We are undertaking actions that were not part of previous operations. We are advancing into areas where the IDF will not need to return. This is not a raid; it is a full-scale operation aimed at completely dismantling the enemy and its infrastructure.' He added that although a large number of the terrorists are 'veteran' Hamas members, many have been enlisted recently. The Hamas terror organization has replaced a significant portion of its forces lost in combat with Israel since October 7, according to reports by Israeli media outlets. According to estimates from the Israeli military, the Gaza-based group had around 25,000 fighters in the coastal enclave before the October 7, 2023 invasion of southwestern Israel. Since then, the IDF estimates that between 17,000 and 20,000 Gaza-based terrorists have been killed, the majority of whom were from Hamas. Additionally, thousands have been rendered incapable of fighting due to injuries sustained during the conflict, and Israel has captured many others. Over 4,300 Gazans are currently being held by Israel, including many Hamas operatives. Despite these significant losses, Hamas has reportedly managed to replenish its ranks, according to a report by Israel's Channel 12. Together with the much smaller Palestinian Islamic Jihad organization, the two terror groups now have between 20,000 to 23,000 men under arms in the Gaza Strip, the report said. The source emphasized that regardless of the number terrorists commanded by Hamas before the war or at present, there has been a notable decline in the quality of its forces, with large numbers of untrained teenagers filling Hamas' ranks.

As ceasefire’s end approaches, Israeli officials doubt Lebanon’s ...	Jerusalem remains concerned about the Lebanese Armed Forces’ ability to fill the vacuum left by Hezbollah. By Baruch Yedid, TPS As the end of a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon approaches, Israeli officials are voicing skepticism about Beirut’s ability to enforce the agreement over the long term. A senior Israeli political source told The Press Service of Israel, 'Until January 27th, there is still an eternity in terms of the region. The decision to completely withdraw from Lebanon could be made even 24 hours before the end of the 60 days, and there is still a long process of electing a president in Lebanon, and more developments are expected in Syria. We are keeping the extension of the [Israel Defense Force’s] stay as an option for all intents and purposes.' Under the terms of a two-month ceasefire that went into effect on November 27, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its armed presence from areas of southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. Israeli forces will also withdraw from southern Lebanon in stages. The Lebanese Armed Forces is to be deployed in southern Lebanon including along the 120 km border with Israel, as will monitors from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. 'The first phase of the agreement is now a test for Israel and Lebanon. Can the Lebanese army confront Hezbollah and impose the terms of the agreement? If not, what happens after the 60 days?' the Israeli political source told TPS-IL. A second Israeli source familiar with US mediator Amos Hochstein’s efforts told TPS-IL Jerusalem remains concerned about the Lebanese Armed Forces’ ability to fill the vacuum left by Hezbollah. 'We are closely examining what is happening on the ground. If the Lebanese are not sufficiently deployed, then what happens on the 61st day will delay the continued implementation of the ceasefire,' he said. January 9 may be a critical juncture. That’s when Lebanon’s parliament gathers to elect a new president. President Michel Aoun’s six-year term ended in October 2023 and political deadlock has left the position vacant ever since. The election comes as Hezbollah is weakened by war and isolated by the overthrow of Syria’s Iran-backed government. By convention, the Lebanese presidency is held by a Maronite Christian. Hezbollah’s preferred candidate had been Suleiman Frangieh, a former cabinet minister, but Frangieh’s strength was his closeness to now-deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad. If a Hezbollah-backed candidate fails to win, it will lose significant political standing and possibly spur the Iran-backed terror group to return to war. The US, France and Saudi Arabia back Lebanese Army Chief Joseph Aoun. The ceasefire gives Israel the ability to respond to Hezbollah violations of the ceasefire, and Israeli forces have frequently uncovered weapons and terror infrastructure south of the Litani River. But repeated Lebanese accusations of 'Israeli violations have fueled tensions. A Lebanese MTV report suggested the U.S. might propose extending the ceasefire agreement for another 60 days to address these challenges. Meanwhile, Israel’s withdrawal from the town of Naqoura has begun. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

UN says Iran executed over 900 people in 2024, including dozens o...	One of the women executed for murder had killed her husband to prevent him from raping her daughter, stated UN rights office spokesperson Liz Throssell. By The Algemeiner and Reuters The number of people executed in Iran rose to 901 last year, including 31 women, some of whom were convicted of murdering their husbands to fend off rape or after being forced into marriage, the UN human rights office said on Tuesday. Most of the executions were for drug-related offenses, but political dissidents and people connected with mass protests in 2022 over the death in police custody of a 22-year-old woman were also among the victims, the UN statement said. 'It is deeply disturbing that yet again we see an increase in the number of people subjected to the death penalty in Iran year-on-year,' United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said in a statement sent to journalists. 'It is high time Iran stemmed this ever-swelling tide of executions.' In total, at least 901 people were executed by hanging last year in the Islamic Republic, compared with 853 in 2023, the UN rights office said. That represented the highest number since 2015, when 972 people were executed. Iran‘s diplomatic mission in Geneva did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the UN statement. The 2022 protests, which sparked some of the worst turmoil since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, followed the death in police detention of Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly flouting Iran‘s mandatory dress code. At least 31 women were executed in 2024, UN rights office spokesperson Liz Throssell told reporters at a Geneva press briefing, representing what she said was the highest number in at least 15 years. 'The majority of cases involved charges of murder. A significant number of the women were victims of domestic violence, child marriage or forced marriage,' she added. One of the women executed for murder had killed her husband to prevent him from raping her daughter, Throssell told Reuters after the briefing. Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist who won election as Iran‘s president in July 2024, made promises during his campaign to better protect the rights of women and minorities.

UAE in talks with US, Israel about provisional government for pos...	The diplomats and officials stressed the ideas that had emerged from the UAE talks lacked detail and had not been distilled into a formal, written plan nor adopted by any government. By The Algemeiner and Reuters The United Arab Emirates has discussed with Israel and the United States participating in a provisional administration of post–war Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority is able to take charge, according to people familiar with the talks. The behind-the-scenes discussions, reported by Reuters for the first time, included the possibility of the UAE and the United States, along with other nations, temporarily overseeing the governance, security, and reconstruction of Gaza after the Israeli military withdraws and until a Palestinian administration is able to take over, a dozen foreign diplomats and Western officials told Reuters. The UAE is a close security partner of the US and, unlike most Arab governments, has diplomatic ties with Israel. The diplomats and officials said this provides the Gulf state with some leverage over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. After more than a year of war, Israel remains reluctant to outline its own vision for Gaza and the international community has struggled to formulate a viable plan, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private. The diplomats and officials stressed the ideas that had emerged from the UAE talks lacked detail and had not been distilled into a formal, written plan nor adopted by any government. In the behind-the-scenes talks, Abu Dhabi is advocating for a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) to govern Gaza, Judea, Samaria, and East Jerusalem under an independent Palestinian state, the sources said — something that Israel has publicly opposed. 'The UAE will not participate in any plan that fails to include significant reform of the Palestinian Authority, its empowerment, and the establishment of a credible roadmap toward a Palestinian state,' a UAE official told Reuters, in response to questions about the discussions. 'These elements — which are currently lacking — are essential for the success of any post–Gaza plan.' The PA was established three decades ago under the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords, signed by Israel and Palestinians, and given limited authority over Judea and Samaria and Gaza. It still exercises limited self-governance in Judea and Samaria but was run out of Gaza in 2007 by Hamas after a brief civil war. A US State Department spokesperson told Reuters there had been talks with several partners, including the UAE, on options for governance, security, and reconstruction, and that various draft proposals, plans and ideas had been put forward by partners. 'These have been deliberative discussions that continue, as we seek the best way forward,' the spokesperson said, declining to comment further on 'private diplomatic conversations.' The Israeli prime minister’s office declined comment for this story. The Palestinian Authority did not respond to Reuters’ questions. In addition to reforming the PA, four of the diplomats and Western officials said that Emirati officials had suggested the use of private military contractors as part of a post–war peacekeeping force in Gaza. The other sources confirmed they were briefed on what they described as Emirati post–war proposals, which included the possible use of such forces. The diplomats and Western officials said any deployment of such contractors would spark concerns among Western nations. Private military contractors, hired by the United States and other governments, have faced accusations of torture, human rights abuses, and use of excessive force, among other allegations, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. The UAE official did not respond to questions about the use of military contractors. RECONSTRUCTION WILL TAKE YEARS Rebuilding Gaza, including its political institutions, is expected to take years and cost tens of billions of dollars, requiring substantial international support, following 15 months of the Israel-Hamas war. While the UAE has criticized the conduct of Israel‘s military and Netanyahu himself, Israel still wants the oil-rich nation involved in post–war Gaza, according to two former Israeli officials, who declined to be identified. Like Israel, the Gulf state opposes Hamas, a US-designated terrorist group that led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war. Abu Dhabi views Hamas and other Islamist groups as destabilizing forces. UAE officials have also expressed concern publicly over the war‘s impact on stability in the Middle East and on efforts towards greater regional integration and economic development. Asked whether Hamas was aware of proposals discussed by the UAE, Basem Naim, one of the organization’s senior officials, told Reuters that after the war, Gaza must be 'distinctly Palestinian' and without 'foreign interventions.' Washington is pushing, alongside mediators Egypt and Qatar, for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Israel and Hamas traded blame in late December for delays in reaching a ceasefire — which both sides had said appeared to be close last month. On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington wanted to see a ceasefire deal concluded in the next two weeks. When asked about the future of Gaza, Brian Hughes, a spokesman for Donald Trump’s transition team, said the US president-elect — who is due to take office on Jan. 20 — would work in close coordination with Arab and Israeli partners 'to ensure that Gaza can one day prosper.' REFORM OF PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY The Gulf state has said it would only send troops to a post–war multinational mission at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority and with the involvement of the US. Netanyahu, however, has said he is against the Palestinian Authority in its current form governing Gaza, citing his long-standing grievances over the PA’s school syllabus, which he says fuels hatred of Israel, and its policy of giving salaries to families of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel for their involvement in terrorist attacks and plots. The UAE has called for a new prime minister to lead the Palestinian Authority, which Emirati officials frequently criticized as corrupt and inept during the closed-door talks, the diplomats and officials said, without providing specifics. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, who took office in March, has pledged to implement reforms within the Palestinian Authority whose finances have been in disarray for years as donor states have cut back funding until corruption and waste are tackled. Emirati officials have mentioned former prime minister Salam Fayyad, a US-educated former World Bank official, as the type of person who would be credible to lead a revamped Palestinian Authority, according to the diplomats and officials. Fayyad served as prime minister from 2007 until resigning in 2013 after falling out with President Mahmoud Abbas, who remains in office. Reuters was unable to reach Fayyad for comment.

No hostage deal without full IDF withdrawal, end to war, Hamas de...	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is a 'partner' in war crimes against Gazans, Hamas claims, threatening to prosecute him for his alleged role in 'the war of extermination.' By World Israel News Staff A senior Hamas spokesman threatened to seek legal charges against a senior Biden administration official, while rejecting any compromise on the terror group's core demands in hostage deal talks with Israel. On Tuesday, senior Hamas spokesman and politburo member Osama Hamdan held a press conference in Algeria, discussing the war in Gaza, ceasefire talks, and the Biden administration. Hamdan pushed back on criticism by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who blamed Hamas intransigence for the failure to reach a ceasefire deal. 'His statements are misleading and we do not trust them, and his partnership in the crimes against our people will be pursued legally,' Hamdan said, accusing the American foreign affairs chief of being 'a partner in the war of extermination.' Turning to hostage deal talks in Doha, Qatar, Hamdan said Hamas would not compromise on any of its core demands, insisting that no captives can be released until Israel agrees to a permanent end to the current war in Gaza and a full withdrawal of IDF forces from the Gaza Strip. 'Our stance is firm: A ceasefire, the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, prisoner exchanges, and Gaza’s reconstruction—no Israeli conditions.' Israel must agree to a 'complete end to the aggression and a full withdrawal from lands the occupation invaded,' Hamdan said. 'We are determined to stop the aggression and for the enemy to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and for relief and reconstruction to be without Israeli conditions,' Hamdan added. 'We hope that this will be achieved as soon as possible.' Regarding the administration of Gaza after the war, Hamdan said Hamas hopes to form a 'national committee' with other Palestinian Arab groups to govern the coastal enclave.

White House staff built a fortress around a fading President	Cabinet officials described a hierarchical structure where the White House simply handed down decisions and expected agencies to implement them, rather than involving cabinet secretaries in policy development. By Jewish Breaking News A coddled and increasingly confused Joe Biden has been trapped inside an elaborate protective bubble constructed by the president’s nervous staff. Multiple insiders revealed to the Washington Post that over the past few years a small cadre of trusted White House advisers implemented strict protocols for Biden that governed everything from meeting lengths to information flow. Senior Democratic lawmakers and even powerful cabinet members like Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen found their direct access to Biden increasingly limited, with key interactions often filtered through intermediaries like National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and senior counselor Steve Ricchetti. Cabinet officials described a hierarchical structure where the White House simply handed down decisions and expected agencies to implement them, rather than involving cabinet secretaries in policy development. Several officials noted difficulty in determining whether Biden’s limited engagement stemmed from age-related concerns or his preference for relying on a close-knit group of advisers. Meanwhile, press aides were instructed to exclude negative coverage from Biden’s news briefings, while presidential interactions became increasingly scripted. When meetings did occur, visitors were told to keep them focused and concise as the president’s energy and accuracy seemed to decline during lengthy sessions. 'I just thought that maybe the president just lost that fight,' Sen. Joe Manchin reflected on his meeting with Biden to the Journal. 'The ability to continue to stay on, just grind it, grind it, grind it.' During campaign events, donors were sometimes given pre-approved questions on notecards to read to the president. Even then, Biden occasionally stumbled, leaving donors puzzled when he made mistakes despite having the questions in advance. The turning point came after Biden’s disastrous June debate performance against Donald Trump made his cognitive challenges impossible to ignore. Despite mounting pressure over his candidacy, President Biden reportedly held a tense virtual meeting with the New Democrat Coalition on July 13. During the call, Biden insisted his polling numbers remained strong. However, when lawmakers challenged his assessment, the president grew visibly frustrated and abruptly ended the call. Eight days later, Biden dropped out of the race.

Israel shoots down nomination for new UN Mideast envoy	Jerusalem rejects United Nations nominee for new Middle East envoy, telling UN Secretary-General António Guterres to draft list of alternative candidates. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli government has rejected the nominee tapped to serve as the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Yedioth Aharanoth reported late Monday night. On November 21st, 2024, the previous UN Middle East envoy, Norway’s Tor Wennesland, announced his resignation from the position, after a rocky tenure. First appointed in December, 2020, Wennesland had been involved in mediating talks between Israel and Hamas prior to the October 7th, 2023 invasion. After the invasion, however, Wennesland admitted that he had misjudged Hamas. 'Politics failed,' he told The New York Times. 'Diplomacy failed. The international community failed. And the parties failed.' United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres recently submitted the nomination of a possible successor, former Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, to Israel for consideration. According to Monday night’s report, Israel rejected Haavisto, an ally of Guterres, over his close ties to the UN Secretary-General, marking a continuation of tensions between Jerusalem and the Portuguese politician who has served as chief UN officer since 2017. Israel also reportedly rejected Haavisto’s candidacy over his past criticisms of the Jewish state, his advocacy in favor of a two-state solution and the establishment of a Palestinian state, and concerns that if appointed, Haavisto would spark a further escalation of tensions between Jerusalem and the UN’s senior leadership. The Israeli government has requested that the United Nations submit a list of alternative candidates from which to choose a replacement for Wennesland. The decision not to accept Haavisto as Special Coordinator sends the matter back to Guterres, who is expected to consult with the United Nations Security Council and the Palestinian Authority.

Israel advances domestic defense manufacturing independence	The agreements were formalized in a signing ceremony with Defense Ministry Director General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and Elbit Systems President and CEO Bezhalel Machlis. By JNS On Tuesday, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced the signing of two significant agreements with Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems, valued at $275 million. These deals aim to advance domestic manufacturing independence and enhance local defense production. The first agreement focuses on the supply of thousands of munitions, while the second involves establishing a facility to produce critical raw materials for Israel’s defense industry. The agreements were formalized in a signing ceremony with Defense Ministry Director General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and Elbit Systems President and CEO Bezhalel Machlis.

'We initiated this historic move before the war, but accelerated it during the conflict,' said Zamir. 'Under both agreements, initial capabilities will soon expand, ultimately achieving full independence in both areas. This is a key lesson from the war that will empower the Israel Defense Forces to continue operating effectively in all theaters.' Machlis stated, 'Elbit Systems is a partner of the IDF and the Israeli Ministry of Defense in advancing the ‘Blue and White’ manufacturing policy and is committed to significantly contributing to the strengthening of the IDF’s munitions independence.'

Unmoved by Trump’s threats, Hamas demands post-war role in Gaza –...	The Gaza terror group reportedly is conditioning any release of Israeli hostages on Israel’s acceptance that Hamas will continue to play a role in governing the coastal enclave after the war. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization is demanding that it be guaranteed a role in governing the Gaza Strip even after the current war with Israel, according to a report by Israel’s national broadcaster, Kan. An Egyptian official cited by the report said that Hamas is insisting that any potential deal including the release of Israeli hostages also feature a provision enshrining the terror group’s right to a role in the post-war Gaza regime. Israel has hitherto insisted that the terror group be completely dismantled prior to the end of the war, and has refused proposals not only to enable Hamas to retain a role in governing Gaza after the war, but has also rejected suggestions that the Palestinian Authority’s ruling Fatah party assume control over the Gaza Strip. While President-elect Donald Trump has pressured Hamas to reach a deal with Israel to release the remaining 100 hostages – including repeated threats that there will be 'hell to pay' if the captives are not freed by inauguration day later this month – Trump’s remarks have had only a marginal influence on Hamas, the official said. Trump reiterated his threat on Monday, telling conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt that if 'If those hostages aren’t released by the time I get to office, there will be hell to pay.' The Egyptian source cited in the Kan report added that another barrier to an agreement is Israel’s hesitation in accepting a ceasefire which will mark the end of the war. Without Israel agreeing to conclude the war and a post-war role for Hamas in Gaza, the terror group is unlikely to even reach an agreement in hostage talks, the official said.

Israel-Turkey war a possibility, warns state commission	Nagel Committee, commissioned by Netanyahu government to assess military preparedness in face of looming threats, warns that Israel could face direct confrontation with Turkey, and must prepare for a possible war. By World Israel News Staff Israel could face a confrontation with Turkey, a state committee warned Monday, adding that a proxy conflict between the two could potentially escalate into a direct war. On Monday, the Nagel Committee submitted its findings to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Meeting with the ministers at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, the committee, headed by Prof. Jacob Nagel, discussed their report on Israel's military readiness and potential threats to state security, and the implications of both for the defense budget. The committee was commissioned by Netanyahu in August, to independently assess the needs of the IDF to confront changing threats Israel is likely to face over the next decade. Among the potential threats identified by the committee are Turkey and its proxies, chief among them Islamist rebel forces in Syria who have seized control over Damascus and who are now working to establish a new government. Warning of the possible dangers of an 'extremist Syrian force that also refuses to accept Israel's very existence,' the report noted in addition that the new Syrian leadership could bring Israel into a confrontation with the rebels' patron state, Turkey. 'The problem would escalate if the Syrian force practically became a 'Turkish' proxy, as part of Turkey's aspirations to restore the Ottoman legacy.' The positioning of Turkish forces within Syria, where Israel's military has operated regularly for over a decade - both to target pro-Iranian forces and to remove potential terrorist threats - could lead to the outbreak of a war between Israel and Turkey, the report hinted. 'The presence of Turkish proxies or forces in Syria could increase the risk of a direct Turkish-Israeli confrontation.' Turkey could also indirectly threaten Israel by aiding the new Syrian leadership in rebuilding the country's shattered military. 'Establishing strong ties with Turkey would shorten the process of the emergence of a new Syrian-Turkish threat.' 'In this context, it must be taken into account that the entry of the Turkish military into Syria could lead to the arming of Syria at a relatively rapid pace.' More broadly, the committee warned of possible 'drastic changes' in Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority that could lead to increased strategic threats to Israel.

Houthi deal? Biden releases 11 Yemenis from Guantanamo Bay	Eleven Yemeni nationals transferred to Oman, ahead of expected closure of Guantanamo Bay. By World Israel News Staff Eleven terrorists with Yemeni citizenship who were imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay were released by the Biden administration and transferred to Oman, the Pentagon said on Monday. The transfer comes as the Biden administration aims to shutter the military prison, which currently holds just 15 detainees. 'Although different processes, each of the Yemeni detainees underwent a thorough, interagency review by career professionals who unanimously determined all detainees as transfer eligible consistent with the national security interests of the United States,' the Department of Defense said in a statement. 'The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Oman and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility,' the DoD added. Moath Hamza Ahmed al-Alwi, an alleged al Qaeda terrorists and bodyguard for Osama bin Laden, was named as one of the 11 freed Yemenis. According to the New York Post, al-Awli was described in declassified documents as making 'several statements since early 2016 that suggest he maintains an extremist mindset.' Another freed Yemeni, Suhayl Abdul Anam al Sharabi, was said to have possibly been 'associated with an aborted 9/11-style hijacking plot in Southwest Asia' as a member of al Qaeda. According to the Washington Post, earlier Yemeni transferees to Oman have receied extensive support, likely paid for by the U.S. government. 'A previous group of Guantánamo detainees transferred to Oman were given housing, access to social welfare benefits — including health care, jobs and cars — and assistance starting, or reuniting with, families,' the Post reported. The release of the Yemenis comes amid repeated Houthi attacks against Israel and American military assets in the Middle East. U.S. efforts to deter the Houthis, including airstrikes on their territory in Yemen, have largely failed to stop the attacks. The post Houthi deal?

‘We built an igloo’ – Israelis rescued from freezing mountain	Three Israeli snowboarders rescued after getting stranded at summit of Mount Shiroma in Japan. By World Israel News Staff Three Israeli snowboarders were rescued on Tuesday after being trapped at the summit of a freezing mountain in Japan for nearly 24 hours. The men, identified by Hebrew-language media as Dor Mordechai, Yoav David and Yair Raz Yaya, deviated from an official trail on Mount Shirouma. Speaking to Ynet, David explained that the trio had planned to explore a well-known backcountry route, but due to a 'navigation' error found themselves stranded. The men, who are all IDF reservists, had a cellphone with which they were able to call for help. The Israeli Consulate in Japan, along with local Japanese police and rescue forces, were unable to immediately rescue the Israelis due to weather conditions. 'We built an igloo and cuddled together to stay warm,' David told Ynet. 'There were tough moments throughout the night, like when they told us it was impossible for us to be rescued by helicopter and that we'd need to spend the night in the snow, when we were already dehydrated and temperatures were low.' The recued men were transported to a local hospital, where they are in good condition despite suffering mild hypothermia and frostbite. In a statement, Israeli Ambassador to Japan Gilad Cohen thanked 'the extraordinary efforts of the Japanese police and the erscue forces on the ground for making the extraction possible.' Cohen also thanked 'the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the U.S. Embassy in Japan for their cooperation and assistance. The lives of Israelis abroad are our top priority.' 'The operations room team worked around the clock in full cooperation with the Israeli consulate, the unit for Israelis abroad, and the local police,' said Magnus Search and Rescue, a group that organizes extractions of Israelis abroad from life-threatening situations. 'Our efforts, in cooperation with all parties involved, led to the best result - the safe return of the travelers home. This is a moment of satisfaction and pride for all of us.'

‘They fought heroically’ – 2 IDF soldiers killed in Gaza	Deaths of Dvir Revach, 28, and Eitan Shkenazi, 24, bring total number of IDF soldiers killed since October 7th to 827. By World Israel News Staff Two Israeli soldiers were killed in battle in the Gaza Strip on Monday by antitank fire, with two others seriously wounded in the same incident. Major Dvir Zion Revah, 28, from Jerusalem, fell in the northern Strip. He served as a Company Commander in the Nahal Brigade's 932 Battalion, the IDF said in a statement. Revah's deputy, Eitan Shkenazi, 24, from Eli, was also killed in the attack, which saw Hamas terrorists launch an antitank missile at a building where soldiers were gathered. Shkenazi is survived by his wife, Hallel. He is the 10th soldier to fall in battle from his hometown of Eli since the beginning of the October 7th war. In a statement, Defense Minister Israel Katz eulogied Revah and Shkenazi, calling them 'Isreali heroes who fell in a battle against Hamas murderers.' Katz priased the slain soldiers for leading 'their fighters with courage and determination, for the security of the state. My heart goes out to their families and loved ones in these painful moments.' 'Eitan, deputy company commander&#8230;fought heroically and led his soldiers in the Nahal Brigade on their way to destroy the enemy, until he fell in battle,' Binyamin Regional Council head Israel Ganz said in a statement. 'He was raised and educated with self-sacrifice and the love of the nation and the Land, and that is how he lived - and how he fell. At this difficult hour, we embrace his dear wife Hallel, his parents, and his entire family. The entire nation of Israel is with you.' According to IDF statistics, Shkenazi and Revah's deaths bring the total of soldiers killed on or since October 7, 2023, to 827. 392 of those casualties fell during the ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, which began in late October 2023.

‘I’m with Israel’ – Trump doubles down on threats to Hamas if hos...	The hostages have to get out now,' says President-elect Donald Trump, reiterating his threat to Hamas that there will be 'hell to pay' if captives not freed by the time he takes office on January 20th. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President-elect Donald Trump warned Monday that there 'will be hell to pay' if the remaining 100 hostages held in the Gaza Strip are not released by the time he takes office on January 20th. Echoing comments made via social media on the eve of the presidential election, Trump told conservative pundit and radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt that he is Israel's 'best friend,' touting his policies during his first term as president. 'I’m the best friend that Israel ever had,' said Trump. 'You look at what happened with all of the things that I’ve gotten, including Jerusalem being the capital, the embassy getting built. I got it built.' 'And of course, the Abraham Accords. Every major event that’s happened to Israel over the last fairly short period of time has been given through me. So I’m with Israel. I think that’s pretty obvious to everybody.' Trump called for the immediate release of the hostages held by Hamas and other terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip, warning that there would be 'hell to pay' if the captives are not freed by the time he takes office on January 20th. He also hinted at the use of force, criticizing President Joe Biden's statement in October 7th, warning Iran and its allies not to escalate the war. 'Exactly what it says. If those hostages aren’t released by the time I get to office, there will be hell to pay,' Trump continued. 'I don’t think I have to go into it anymore. It won’t be the word 'don’t'&#8230; There will be hell to pay. Those hostages have to get out. They have to get out now.' On the eve of last month's election, Trump took to his Truth Social account to warn criticize Biden's handling of the crisis, and to warn that there would be 'all hell to pay' if the hostages were not released by inauguration day.

Terrorist files medical malpractice suit for injuries sustained d...	Tel Aviv District Prosecutor's Office submitted the request for dismissal of the claim on the grounds that the state does not owe damages to a member of a terrorist organization who attacks Israelis. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's State Prosecution has requested a dismissal of medical malpractice claim made by a terrorist for injuries sustained during his attack against IDF soldiers, Arutz Sheva reports. Tel Aviv District Prosecutor's Office submitted the request for dismissal on the grounds that the state does not owe damages to a member of a terrorist organization who commits destructive acts against individuals and the State of Israel even after leaving prison. In October 2015, the terrorist who made the claim went from his home in Dura close to Hebron and entered Negohot in Samaria with a rifle and a knife, intending to attack Israeli security forces. When soldiers saw him, they fired, and he sustained injuries for which he received medical treatment in prison. The military court convicted the terrorist to 40 months in prison. Like many terrorists, he received money from the Palestinian Authority for his terrorist activity. On social media, his posts regularly praise Hamas, defame Israel, and encourage others to carry out terror attacks and seek 'martyrdom.' He also praised Hamas for carrying out atrocities against Israelis on October 7 and encouraged Palestinians to take Jewish captives. The prosecution seeks an outright dismissal of the convicted terrorist's claim and said, 'There is no justification for compensating individuals involved in terrorism for damages they claim, particularly when they are actively working against the State of Israel or its citizens.' On January 2, the Israeli NGO Regavim, which focuses on protecting the country's national lands and resources, published a detailed report revealing the involvement of members of the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF) in terrorist activities targeting Israelis. The report, titled *'Officers by Day—Terrorists by Night,'* documents that at least 16 PASF members were killed while carrying out attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers. In total, over 80 PASF members were killed, injured, or arrested between 2021 and 2023 for their participation in similar acts of terrorism.

El Al gives away free miles to over 80,000 IDF reservists	In total, some 81,000 reservists received the free points for a total of 18 million cumulative days of reserve duty, the airline said. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS Israel’s flagship carrier El Al gave out 1.8 billion miles to more than 80,000 Israel Defense Forces reservists in a 48-hour promotion this past week in recognition of their military service. The offer came amid a national public outcry and an ongoing investigation into allegations of price gouging over the last 15 months when the national carrier had a virtual monopoly on many routes, including the lucrative transatlantic flights to New York, after most foreign carriers suspended service to and from Tel Aviv. The short-lived promotion, which overwhelmed the carrier’s website and ended Wednesday, was available to reservists who were called up for more than 100 days of service, and gave them 100 frequent flyer points for each day served. In total, some 81,000 reservists received the free points for a total of 18 million cumulative days of reserve duty, the airline said. The total cost of the mileage giveaway, which was heavily advertised on television as well as on social media, was in the tens of thousands of shekels. In addition, reservists who served at least 60 days were offered full cash refunds for canceled flights, seat upgrades and extra baggage allowances. However, tens of thousands of eligible reservists were left disappointed as they did not manage to get through to claim their miles. While El Al has won accolades for flying continuously throughout the war, it has been heavily criticized for exorbitant pricing over the last 15 months when it raked in record-breaking profits. One video circulating in Israel decried the promotion as a 'dirty trick' that sought to cover up the carrier’s overcharging during the war by usage of slick marketing. Multiple foreign airlines have resumed service to Israel over the last month reducing prices to Europe, although the three major U.S. legacy carriers have not restarted flights to Israel yet.

Drill, baby, drill: Trump vows to reverse Biden’s ‘ridiculous’ of...	Trump, who is set to take office in two weeks, has repeatedly promised to roll back Biden’s climate change initiatives and restore American 'energy dominance.' By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Affirming his pledge to ramp up domestic energy production, President-elect Donald Trump on Monday vowed to reverse President Joe Biden’s 'ridiculous' ban on new offshore oil drilling and natural gas development across U.S. coastal waters. 'I see it just came over that Biden has banned all oil and gas drilling across 625 million acres of U.S. coastal territory. It's ridiculous. I'll unban it immediately,' Trump said in an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt. Biden’s ban covers new oil and gas development on all federal waters off the East and West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and portions of the northern Bering Sea in Alaska, according to Reuters. The move comes as Democratic lawmakers and environmental organizations have urged Biden to 'maximize permanent protections' against offshore drilling in the final weeks of his presidency. Trump, who is set to take office in two weeks, has repeatedly promised to roll back Biden’s climate change initiatives and restore American 'energy dominance.' 'This is a disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices,' Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday. 'Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby, drill.' The White House said Biden is invoking his authority under the 70-year-old Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which allows presidents to block areas from drilling and mineral leasing. The ban may be difficult for Trump to reverse as the Lands Act does not grant presidents the authority to overturn prior bans, according to a 2019 court ruling. 'Drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation's energy needs. It is not worth the risks,' Biden said in a statement. Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, slammed Biden’s decision as 'politically motivated,' urging Congress to 'use every tool at their disposal to reverse' the move and 'restore a pro-American energy approach to federal leasing.' Biden sold off nearly half of the U.S. oil reserve in 2022, with some going to the Chinese Communist Party and other foreign entities. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve now holds fewer than 400 million barrels, down from almost 600 million at the start of 2022.

UN accused of funding illegal construction in Israeli nature rese...	A sign near the pipeline claims the pipeline extends 5.8 kilometers and was constructed between October 2018 and January 2019 by a contractor identified as MEDCO Company. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Illegal water pipeline infrastructure bearing the logo of the UN Humanitarian Fund has been running through the heart of a protected nature reserve in the Judean Desert in violation of Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements, The Press Service of Israel can report. 'The UN is advancing the establishment of a Palestinian state at any cost, disregarding laws and agreements, and funding illegal construction—even in areas where the Palestinians explicitly agreed not to build,' legal expert Maurice Hirsch told The Press Service of Israel. 'This is a glaring example of negligence by Israel in the face of blatant violations,' added Hirsch, the former Director of the Military Prosecution for Judea and Samaria and current Director of the Initiative for Palestinian Authority Accountability and Reform at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. The area, known as the Judean Desert Nature Reserve, was originally designated as Area B, meaning it came under Palestinian Authority administrative jurisdiction and Israeli security responsibility. However, the 41,000-acre reserve, was enshrined as a 'no-build' zone under the 1998 Wye River Memorandum. However recent findings highlight systematic violations, apparently financed through international funding. A visit to the reserve in August revealed vast stretches of illegal construction, including villas, swimming pools, and the water pipeline. A sign near the pipeline credited funding to the UN Humanitarian Fund (UNHF), with claims suggesting the infrastructure serves illegal structures nearby. A separate sponsorship sign said the pipeline was funded by the UN Humanitarian Fund and implemented by the Arab Agronomists Association (AAA) in partnership with the municipality of Zatara, a Palestinian village southeast of Bethlehem. The sign claims the pipeline extends 5.8 kilometers and was constructed between October 2018 and January 2019 by a contractor identified as MEDCO Company. The sign also contained the coding 'OPT-18/DDA-3482/SA1/WASH/NGO/8999.' OPT commonly refers to 'Occupied Palestinian Territories' in UN documents. 'We’re looking at a UN-funded water pipeline project allegedly aimed at assisting marginalized communities, yet it’s located inside a nature reserve—a zone that should be protected from such activities,' said Naomi Kahn of Regavim, a non-governmental organization that monitors illegal Palestinian construction in Judea and Samaria. 'Not only is this infrastructure illegally placed within the reserve, but it is also supplying water to illegally built homes, not agricultural communities,' explained Kahn, who is director Regavim’s international division. Hirsch questioned the legality of the UN’s involvement in the project, stressing that international organizations are expected to act as neutral parties and respect local laws. 'There’s no need to negotiate with the UN about this illegal activity,' Hirsch told TPS-IL. 'These infrastructures should be dismantled immediately. Their actions—falsely claiming these funds are for communities far from the reserve—are blatantly dishonest.' An online search for MEDCO Company found no results beyond references to UN-funded pipeline projects, raising concerns about the firm’s legitimacy as a contractor. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) listed the project under the same code and provided additional financial details. According to OCHA, the Arab Agronomists Association received multiple payments totaling over $245,000 for the project, officially spanning from May 2018 to February 2019. However, observations on the ground reveal that the infrastructure primarily supports illegal construction within the Judean Desert Nature Reserve — a significant distance from Zatara, the community the project was allegedly meant to benefit. 'And even if this was built in Area C, did they secure the necessary permits? Everything is a lie upon a lie. Israel repeatedly turns a blind eye to such violations, and it simply doesn’t work,' Hirsch told TPS-IL. 'In recent years, the UN has increased the level of secrecy surrounding its funding to the Palestinians in order to shield its work from public scrutiny,' Anne Herzberg, Legal Advisor of NGO Monitor told TPS-IL. 'Donor nations should withhold funding and UN agencies should be blocked from operating in the region until its work is open to taxpayers for a full investigation and review,' she noted. OCHA did not respond to TPS-IL’s inquiries regarding the pipeline’s sponsorship or the MEDCO Company’s credentials. Illegal construction in the reserve has surged in recent years. Aerial surveys conducted by the NGO Regavim identified over 3,400 illegal structures in the reserve—up from just 268 at the time of the Wye River agreement. Israel began razing illegal Palestinian buildings inside the nature reserve in December. During the August tour of the reserve, TPS-IL also witnessed expansive illegal construction spanning kilometers, piles of construction debris and trash as well as scorch marks in the ground left behind by the burning of garbage. There were buildings in various stages of construction, ranging from still-wet cement foundations to a completed building resembling a guest house with a swimming pool. In response to enforcement queries, the Israel Defense Force’s Spokesperson’s Unit confirmed in January that responsibility for addressing illegal construction in the reserve was recently transferred to the military under directives from the Israeli government. 'In light of the Palestinian Authority’s violation of the Interim Agreement, enforcement responsibility in the reserve was transferred to the IDF,' the spokesperson told TPS-IL. 'Authorities have begun taking action under this directive.' The IDF declined to comment specifically on the UN-sponsored pipeline or its role in the illegally built compound.

By Pesach Benson, TPS The three Israelis killed in Monday’s shooting attack near Kedumim were identified as two retired educators and a police officer. The three were killed in the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq, near the town of Kedumim when terrorists opened fire on a bus and several vehicles. Another eight were injured. Israeli security forces are searching for two suspects seen in security footage taken at the scene. Police Master Sgt. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein, 36, fired at the terrorists before being fatally shot. A resident of the nearby community of Ein HaNatziv, Winkelstein is survived by his wife and two children. One of Winkelstein’s sons was in the car during the attack. He will be laid to rest in Jerusalem on Monday evening. Rachel Cohen, 73, and Aliza Raiz, 69, were both retired school counselors and residents of Kedumim. Cohen is survived by her husband and five daughters. Reiss, who was due to celebrate her 70th birthday in the coming days, is survived by her husband and children. Their funeral arrangements have not been announced yet. An eyewitness told The Press Service of Israel that the attack was 'a shooting spree.' Meanwhile, the Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba, where six of the victims were treated, said one man in his 60s was released from the operating room but remains in life-threatening condition. Another victim is in mild condition while four more were treated in the emergency room and released. Two women in their 70s and 80s were taken to the Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikvah with moderate injuries.

16 PA security personnel killed while attacking Israelis	This pattern of behavior remains unchanged. The Palestinian Authority not only fails to oppose terrorism, it actively endorses it,' the researchers concluded. By Josh Hasten, JNS Israeli NGO Regavim, dedicated to the protection of the country’s national lands and resources, released an extensive report on Jan. 2 highlighting the involvement of members of the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF) in terrorism targeting Israelis. No fewer than 16 PASF members were killed while attacking Israeli civilians and soldiers, the report, titled 'Officers by Day—Terrorists by Night,' reveals. More than 80 were killed, injured or arrested between 2021 and 2023 while engaging in comparable acts of terrorism. 'The Palestinian Authority’s involvement in encouraging and promoting terrorism goes beyond direct acts of violence, as the P.A. publicly celebrates terrorists who are not on the PASF payroll by providing military-style honor guards and funerals, particularly for those affiliated with Hamas,' Regavim added. While the PASF are cracking down on Islamist terrorists in P.A.-controlled cities, especially Jenin, Regavim’s researchers concluded that such confrontations are actually 'a means of consolidating the Palestinian Authority’s power and legitimacy as the best alternative for ‘the day after’ the ongoing war—in Judea and Samaria, as well as in Gaza.' Moshe Shmueli, director of Regavim’s Field Division and a high-ranking officer in the IDF reserves intimately familiar with the issue, said, 'These operations can best be described as window dressing—too little and far too late to be taken seriously. The P.A. is not part of the solution, it has been neck-deep in terrorism for decades, and recent theatrics have not changed the DNA of PASF.' The Regavim report shared that 'the P.A. honors fallen terrorists from the very same groups that are now ostensibly being targeted by [its] enforcement activities, naming streets, public squares, and even schools and educational programs after them, embedding their legacy into the community’s daily life. 'This glorification extends into cultural and educational domains, where terrorists are extolled through music, poetry and school curricula, influencing the next generation. 'Additionally, the P.A.’s ‘pay-for-slay’ program offers financial incentives to terrorists and their families, thereby economically rewarding acts of terrorism. 'This pattern of behavior remains unchanged. The Palestinian Authority not only fails to oppose terrorism, it actively endorses it,' the researchers concluded. The P.A. is protecting itself Maurice Hirsch, director of the Initiative for Palestinian Authority Accountability and Reform at the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs and the former director of the Military Prosecution in Judea and Samaria, commented on the report, telling JNS, 'The PASF has played a leading role in Palestinian terror against Israel for over two and a half decades. P.A. officials openly gloat about the fact. 'The Oslo delusion envisaged nothing more than a P.A. police force,' he added. However, the P.A. 'has built a huge terror army. That army has been funded and trained by both the U.S. and the Europeans. 'While the PASF either actively participated in terror or ignored the efforts of the other terror organizations to attack Israel and Israelis, it only kicked into action against Palestinians, as we are seeing in Jenin, when those terrorists threatened the Fatah’s dictatorial rule,' Hirsch said. Likud MK Dan Illouz told JNS, 'The P.A. is not a peace partner—it is a terror regime in suits. Its ‘security forces’ are nothing more than terrorists with badges, murdering Israelis while pretending to fight extremism. This is not a bug in the system, it is the system. It’s not infiltration, it’s policy.' The P.A. has 'fueled terror, paying salaries to murderers, glorifying jihad and inciting genocide against Jews' for decades. 'Enough with the illusions—this is a factory of hatred, not a future state,' he said. 'Israel must end all cooperation, cut all funding, and expose the P.A. for what it truly is—a clear and present danger to peace,' Illouz said. Next steps Naomi Kahn, director of Regavim’s International Division, told JNS, 'It’s time to stop living in the fantasy world in which the Palestinian Authority is a ‘moderating force,’ a ‘partner for peace,’ a ‘legitimate alternative’ for autonomous Arab governance of any territory from which terrorism can continue to threaten the lives of Israeli citizens. 'Regavim has been monitoring official Palestinian Authority publications, where the uncomfortable truth is clearly and repeatedly stated at every opportunity,' Kahn said. 'The P.A. will never stop funding, supporting and actively participating in violence against Israelis, and has never abandoned the raison d’être of the PLO, the founding pillar of the Palestinian Authority: the eradication of the State of Israel and the ethnic cleansing—through local and internationalized violent ‘resistance’—of every Jew from the Middle East.' Therefore, the Israeli government 'has a moral obligation to disempower these genocidal forces, to protect the lives of Jewish and non-Jewish citizens of Israel, to fight the forces of jihadism, and to reclaim historical, moral, political rights to life, liberty and sovereignty for the Jewish people in the Land of Israel,' Kahn said. MK Ohad Tal of the Religious Zionism Party told JNS he agreed that the P.A. must go. 'The fact that the Palestinian Authority and its officers encourage, support and even participate in terrorism is not new. Therefore, any call to strengthen the P.A. is a call to spread terrorism. After October 7, we are done fooling ourselves—the Palestinian Authority must be dismantled!' Tal said.

Justin Trudeau set to resign as party leader, drop out of race fo...	Facing a sinking approval rating and growing dissent within his own party, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reportedly is poised to resign as Liberal Party chairman, effectively dropping out of this year's race for premier. By World Israel News Staff Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is poised to announce his resignation as leader of the ruling Liberal Party this week, multiple Canadian media outlets reported over the weekend. According to sources cited by The Globe and Mail, Trudeau will likely make his formal announcement this week, sometime before a national caucus meeting this Wednesday. While the sources said that no final decision had been made on such an announcement, it appears likely Trudeau will resign in the near future. It is unclear whether Trudeau will stay on as premier to serve out the remainder of his term, or step down as prime minister immediately. Trudeau has served as Canada's head of government for nine years, through three federal elections, and is currently slated to remain in office through the next election, to be held no later than this October. Once boasting an approval rating of 65%, Trudeau now faces widespread disapproval in the Canadian electorate, with an approval rating of just 16%, according to an Angus Reid Institute poll released last week. 'It represents the lowest level of support for the party in Angus Reid Institute tracking dating back to 2014. It is also quite possibly the lowest vote intention the Liberals have ever received in the modern era,' the pollster said in a press release. Facing a general election sometime no later than October, the Liberal Party under Trudeau has seen its polling numbers sink, giving the Conservatives, under Pierre Poilievre, a significant lead. Trudeau's Liberal Party narrowly lost the popular vote to the Conservatives in 2021, while still winning a plurality of seats in Canada's House of Commons. Now, however, polls show the Conservatives receiving anywhere between 43% and 48% of the popular vote, while the latest Angus Reid poll gives the Liberals just 16%. Amid his poor polling numbers, Trudeau now faces a coup from his own party, including widespread calls for his resignation and the surprise departure of deputy premier and finance chief Chrystia Freeland from the Trudeau government. In a scathing letter, Freeland blasted Trudeau's 'political gimmicks.'

100,000 shekels and weapons seized in counter-terror raid	Wanted terrorist killed in shoot-out with security forces; explosives laboratory discovered at his home. By World Israel News Staff A counter-terror raid carried out on Sunday by Border Police unearthed nearly 100,000 shekels in cash, numerous guns and ammunition, and an explosives laboratory. Hassan Raba'a, a resident of Meithalun, a PA-controlled town in Samaria, began shooting at officers as they attempted to arrest him on terror charges. During the firefight, the man was shot dead. A search of his body found that he was carrying two handguns. After a subsequent search of his home, Border Police officers seized a shotgun, pipe bombs, ammunition, and 96,000 shekels in cash ($26,000). A warehouse on the man's property, which was being used for manufacturing explosives, was destroyed by security forces. Also on Sunday, during a routine inspection at the entrance to Nablus (Shechem), troops stopped a vehicle which was found to be carrying 20 pistols and cartridges. The driver was arrested and taken for questioning. Last week, in a joint operation between the Shin Bet, Border Police, and IDF, security forces carried out an undercover operation to arrest a wanted terrorist. Dressed in civilian clothes, security forces detained the man at a cafe in Nablus. After the suspect was arrested, violent clashes broke out between locals and security forces. Some threw firebombs, rocks, and other projectiles at the troops as they withdrew from the city. Security forces responded by shooting several of the rioters and neutralizing the threat, according to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Mako. According to analysts, Iran has been stepping up it attempts to smuggle weapons to Palestinian terrorists in Judea and Samaria in recent months. 'Iran is using its bases in Syria and the Captagon [amphetamine]-running networks to bring in weapons into Jordan and from there to Samaria — the ‘River’ Jordan is a creek,' Col. (res.) Eran Lerman, vice president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS), told JNS. 'They are also using Muslim Brotherhood infrastructures in Jordan to mobilize terrorists.'

Trump takes aim at Kamala’s ‘illegal’ pre-interview campaign paym...	Last year, Trump posted that, if reelected, he would investigate Comcast over what he called 'one-side[d] and vicious coverage' from the media conglomerate's flagship news channels, NBC and MSNBC. By Chuck Ross, The Washington Free Beacon President-elect Donald Trump accused MSNBC host Al Sharpton of taking illegal donations from the Kamala Harris campaign ahead of softball interviews with the Democrat last year, potentially spelling trouble for MSNBC and its parent company Comcast ahead of a planned corporate spinoff. In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump accused the Harris campaign of seeking to 'illegally buy endorsements' from Sharpton and celebrities like Beyoncé Knowles and Oprah Winfrey prior to the election. Trump's remarks were based on a Washington Free Beacon report that the Harris campaign donated $500,000 to Sharpton's nonprofit, the National Action Network, weeks before the activist interviewed Harris on his MSNBC show, PoliticsNation. 'Totally against the law,' Trump asserted. The comments raise questions about whether Trump could take action in his second presidential term to block Comcast's proposed spinoff of its news networks. The media giant in November announced plans to spin off NBC, MSNBC, and CNBC into a separate public company—a bid to separate its movie studios from the dwindling cable TV business. Comcast and MSNBC did not return requests for comment. At least one industry expert said that while he did not expect the spinoff to face headwinds from federal agencies, Trump was an 'X factor' that could gum up the process. Trump could 'slow-down or otherwise interfere with the transaction,' said investment analyst Blair Levin, who noted that MSNBC is a 'major Trump nemesis.' Last year, Trump posted that, if reelected, he would investigate Comcast over what he called 'one-side[d] and vicious coverage' from the media conglomerate's flagship news channels, NBC and MSNBC. And Trump could be emboldened to take on the media conglomerate after winning a $15 million legal settlement last month with ABC News over comments from host George Stephanopoulos, who falsely claimed Trump was found liable for raping a woman in the 1990s. Trump has stymied other media conglomerates in the past. Before the 2016 election, he came out against the proposed $85 billion merger between AT&T and Time Warner, the owner of the anti-Trump news channel CNN. The Department of Justice under Trump sued to block the merger in 2017. The merger was completed in 2018, but the companies spent years in court fighting the DOJ's lawsuit and subsequent appeal. Trump's new focus on the Harris campaign's payments to Sharpton's nonprofit could provide the impetus for him to get involved in the MSNBC spinoff. Trump did not describe what he believes is illegal about the Harris campaign's donations to the National Action Network, which Sharpton launched in 1991, the same year he stoked the anti-Semitic Crown Heights riots in New York City. MSNBC has tried to distance itself from the Sharpton donation, telling the Free Beacon that it was 'unaware' of the payment. The network, which prohibits employees from engaging in political activity without corporate approval, has declined to describe its discussions with Sharpton on the issue. The Society of Professional Journalists, a prominent media watchdog group, called the conflict of interest a 'black eye' that 'harms the credibility of the journalist, the news organization, and journalism overall.' Sharpton has been accused of using the National Action Network as a personal piggybank and wielding power against corporations. Sharpton landed his MSNBC show in 2011, a year after Comcast hired him to lobby on behalf of the media giant's merger with NBCUniversal. Sharpton's questionable lobbying role had generated scrutiny from outlets such as the New York Times, which wrote that it 'raises issues about [a] possible MSNBC job.' Byron Allen, one of the most successful black media moguls in the country, sued Comcast, Sharpton, and National Action Network in 2015 over what he called 'sham diversity agreements' between Sharpton and Comcast. Allen alleged that Sharpton 'has a business model and track record of obtaining payments from corporate entities in exchange for his support.' The National Action Network paid Sharpton more than $650,000 in salary in 2023, according to tax filings obtained by the Free Beacon. Sharpton and the National Action Network have not responded to numerous requests for comment. The Harris campaign's donation to the National Action Network came as it gave more than $5 million to black and Latino groups, seemingly to turn out voters in those demographics. The campaign gave $2 million to the National Urban League and $120,000 to Casa in Action, a Latino voter group. Those groups' leaders did not also work at major news organizations. The Harris campaign doled out millions more to celebrities and musicians who endorsed Harris at campaign rallies before the election. The campaign paid $2 million to Winfrey's production company after Winfrey hosted an arena event for Harris on September 19. The campaign paid $165,000 to Knowles's production company and $75,000 to Bruce Springsteen's company, the Free Beacon reported. Knowles endorsed Harris at a campaign event in Houston on October 25, though she did not perform any songs, much to the chagrin of Harris supporters and Knowles fans. Trump posted this week that 'Beyoncé didn't sing, Oprah didn't do much of anything … and Al is just a third rate Con Man.'

Israeli NBA sensation Deni Avdija’s career soars in Portland	Avdija's standout performances have earned him a starting spot for the Trail Blazers, who are currently 13th in the Western Conference with a 12-22 record. By Joshua Marks, JNS Deni Avdija, the Israeli NBA basketball player, is experiencing a career surge in the Pacific Northwest after being traded to the Portland Trail Blazers on July 6. The 24-year-old small forward, hailing from Beit Zera, a kibbutz just south of the Sea of Galilee, was a finalist for Player of the Month in the Western Conference for December, narrowly missing out to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder. During December, Avdija averaged 16.8 points (43.1% from three-point range), 5.2 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game. On January 3, his 24th birthday, he posted an impressive 19 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 assists in a 114-106 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Just two days later, Avdija excelled in a 105-102 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, securing another double-double with 19 points and 14 rebounds in a season-high 43 minutes of play. These standout performances have earned him a starting spot for the Trail Blazers, who are currently 13th in the Western Conference with a 12-22 record. Avdija was drafted ninth overall by the Washington Wizards in the 2020 NBA Draft, where he played for four seasons at the Capital One Arena before his recent trade. Before his NBA career, Avdija made his mark with Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv from 2017 to 2020, leading the team to three domestic league titles. He also won back-to-back gold medals at the FIBA U20 European Championship in 2018 in Germany and 2019 in Israel. His accolades include being named Israeli League MVP in 2020 and FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship MVP in 2019.

Israel's Unit 504 investigators discovered that the hospital director was involved in planning and coordinating terror activity and that Hamas terrorists planned to escape from the hospital in ambulances when the IDF raid began. The IDF and Shin Bet, Israel's security forces, raided the hospital last Friday on intelligence that terrorists were using the hospital as a headquarters. Around 240 Hamas terrorists were arrested in the raid, including many who participated in the October 7 massacre. An IDF reservist described his interrogation of a Hamas terrorist, who admitted that the hospital director was instrumental in directing terrorist activity. The reservist said, 'We discovered that the individual at the center of the event, orchestrating the terror and Hamas activities within the compound, was the hospital director himself.' The reservist added that Dr. Abu Safiyeh, the hospital director, 'strutted around like a peacock, certain that he wouldn't be arrested and fully convinced he was in control of the situation.' A second reservist confirmed that the hospital director was a member of Hamas. Abu Safiyeh 'really did walk around like a peacock' he said. 'He watched as his doctors were incriminated one by one, still convinced he wouldn't face arrest.' He added, 'But we soon saw through his disguise—it was nothing more than a facade. They were terrorists with blood on their hands. The hospital director finally realized that the entire ruse had unraveled, and in the end, he too was arrested.' Working in coordination with COGAT, the IDF completed the evacuation of 350 patients and medical professionals from the facility prior to the raid. Some of the 'patients' were really Hamas terrorists in disguise. Israel's military also ensured the delivery of food, fuel, and medical supplies to keep the treatment areas functioning. In addition, 95 patients and staff were transferred to the Indonesian hospital in Gaza, along with two generators and thousands of liters of essential supplies. The 401st brigade, located around the perimeter of the hospital, arrested terrorists and eliminated those who attacked troops or resisted arrest. Israeli special forces found in the hospital an arsenal of weapons, including grenades, firearms, and other military equipment.

Hostage list raises hopes Israel family still alive, PM denies re...	List of hostages purportedly provided by Hamas to Israel raises hopes that the Bibas family may still be alive in captivity - but Israel's prime minister downplays reports, saying list was drawn up by Israel months ago. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A list of Israeli captives in the Gaza Strip published by media outlets Monday has raised hopes among the families of captives that their loved ones may still be alive and up for release in the first phase of a possible ceasefire, while Israel's prime minister dismissed the document Monday. On Sunday, a senior Hamas official told Reuters that the terror group had submitted a list of 34 hostages who may be freed during the first phase of a ceasefire with Israel. A day later, media outlets including the BBC and Saudi Arabia's al-Sharq published the list, which included the names of 10 women, 11 elderly men, two children, and 11 men under 50. The full list included the following names:Romi Gonen (24); Emily Damari (28); Arbel Yehoud (29); Doron Steinbrecher (31); Ariel Bibas (5); Kfir Bibas (1); Shiri Silberman Bibas (33); Liri Albag (19); Karina Ariev (20); Agam Berger (20); Daniel Gilboa (20); Naama Levy (20); Ohad Ben-Ami (55); Gad Moshe Moses (80); Keith Shmuel Siegel (65); Offer Kaldaron (53); Eliyahu Sharabi (52); Itzhak Elgaret (69); Shlomo Mansur (86); Ohad Yahalomi (50); Yousef Yousef Alziadna (54); Oded Lifshitz (84); Tsachi Idan (50); Hisham al-Sayed (36); Yarden Bibas (35); Sagi Dekel Chen (36); Iair Horn (46); Omer Wenkert (23); Alexandre Troufanov (28); Eliya Cohen (27); Or Levy (34); Avera Mengistu (38); Tal Shoham (39); Omer Shem Tov (21). The list included the names of captives Hamas claimed had died in captivity, including members of the Bibas family, three of whom were allegedly killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023. In the past, however, Hamas has falsely claimed captives were killed by Israeli airstrikes, with the claim later being disproven. The inclusion of all four members of the Bibas family, including the father, Yarden, mother, Shiri, and sons Ariel and Kfir, has rekindled hopes Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were not, in fact, killed in November 2023. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu downplayed the list, saying Monday that the document was in fact a list drafted by Israel and given to hostage deal brokers in July 2024. 'The list of hostages that has been published in the media was not provided to Israel by Hamas but was originally given by Israel to the mediators in July 2024,' Netanyahu said. 'As yet, Israel has not received any confirmation or comment by Hamas regarding the status of the hostages appearing on the list. Israel will continue to act relentlessly for the return of all of our hostages.' An Israeli source cited by Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, Monday morning said that 'contrary to denials by the Prime Minister's Office, Hamas has submitted a list of hostages to be released, but has not disclosed if any of them are alive.' There are no indications from the list published Monday whether the captives are alive. Hamas has reportedly sought to include dead hostages in the list of 34 captives to be released in the first phase of a ceasefire.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken says White House is pushing for ceasefire and hostage deal to be finalized in next two weeks, amid reports Hamas has handed over list of Israeli hostages. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration is working behind the scenes to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump two weeks from now. Speaking at a press conference in South Korea Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration remains hopeful it can finalize an agreement to free the remaining roughly 100 hostages and bring an end to the fighting in Gaza before the president leaves office. 'We very much want to bring this over the finish line in the next two weeks, the time we have remaining,' Blinken said. 'We have been working intensely to bring this agreement&#8230;that President Biden put forward back in May, and that the entire world got being, country after country&#8230;we're working very hard to bring that over the finish line.' Blinken suggested that recent talks in Doha, Qatar had displayed 'intensified engagement' by negotiators, including Hamas' delegation, potentially signaling that a breakthrough is possible. 'What we've seen in the last couple of weeks is a intensified engagement, including by Hamas. But we have yet to see agreement on the final points,' Blinken continued. 'We will work every minute of every day of those two weeks to try to get that to happen.' 'We want to reach the finish line in the talks for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip within two weeks, and get the hostages out of there.' Israel dispatched Mossad chief David Barnea, who is leading the Israeli negotiating team, back to Doha on Monday for the latest round of talks, after Biden administration envoy Brett McGurk arrived in the Qatari capital.

Iran’s illegal oil exports quadruple under Biden’s watch	Conservative estimates place the value of crude oil and condensate exports at $135 billion during Biden’s term, with an additional $25 billion from fuel oil exports. By Jewish Breaking News A damning investigation by oil tanker tracking firms has exposed the spectacular collapse of Iran sanctions under President Joe Biden, with the Islamic Republic managing to export an astronomical 2 billion barrels of oil during his presidency. Data from commodity intelligence firm Kpler reveals the full scope of Biden’s policy failure. When he took office in January 2021, Iran’s daily oil exports were constrained to under 400,000 barrels, in large part due to Trump’s 'maximum pressure' policy. By last year, that number had exploded to 1.6 million barrels per day. The regime’s sanctions-busting operation has also grown increasingly sophisticated. United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) identified 132 new vessels joining Iran’s 'ghost fleet,' bringing the total number of tankers involved in their illegal enterprise to 477. While UANI’s intelligence led to over 330 flag revocations and helped the U.S. government finally designate 139 vessels for sanctions, it comes as too little, too late, with Iran exporting 587 million barrels in 2024 alone. Conservative estimates place the value of crude oil and condensate exports at $135 billion during Biden’s term, with an additional $25 billion from fuel oil exports. However, experts note to Iran International that steep discounts of $10-30 per barrel are being offered to China which eagerly gobbles up 91% of Iran’s illicit exports. Even more troubling, Iran’s oil revenue flows through an opaque system of cash payments and barter arrangements with China, making it nearly impossible to track how these billions may be funding the regime’s nuclear program and regional terror proxies. Approximately $1 billion worth of oil is being held in China’s Dalian Port. Russia is also helping to prop up the Iranian regime. Last month, President Masoud Pezeshkian met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ashgabat to coordinate support on evading sanctions in the oil, gas, and energy sectors. 'We held talks with the Russian President. They lasted about an hour. We discussed once again the agreements and contracts that we have signed with Russia. We have a constructive interaction. We agreed to speed up the implementation of projects in the fields of gas, road and railway construction, water desalination, and other projects in the fields of energy, petrochemicals, and electricity supply,' Pezeshkian’s press service said in a statement.

Dozens of Gazan terrorists being treated in Israeli hospitals	The move was necessary due to the closure of the hospital in the terrorist detention facility of Sde Teiman. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Dozens of recently captured Gazan terrorists are being treated in Israeli hospitals due to the recent closure of the medical center in the large detention facility at the Sde Teiman military base, Channel 12 reported Sunday. Some 60 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad combatants of the 240 caught in the IDF raid ten days ago on the Kamal Adwan Hospital that had become a terror base in northern Gaza, have been brought to hospitals both near and far. These included Barzilai in Ashkelon and Assuta Ashdod just north of the Strip, as well as Ichilov in Tel Aviv, Wolfson in Holon and Shaare Zedek in Jerusalem, said the report. Among the captured terrorists were those who had participated in the Hamas-led invasion of Israel last October 7 in which 1,200 people were massacred, including women and children. The IDF and Ministry of Health had shut down the southern base’s medical facility in October due to the dwindling number of terrorists needing care. The Health Ministry stated at the time that 'Recently there has been a significant decrease in the volume of activity at the medical facility, due to the change in the activity of the detention facility and the transfer of detainees to other detention facilities. In fact, recently there have been no patients at all at the medical facility.' 'The army and the ministry are making the necessary adjustments to the infrastructure in order to respond according to needs,' the statement added, and later senior ministry officials clarified that 'in the event of renewed intensification of the fighting, the facility will be reactivated.' A Channel 12 report stated then that 'at the peak of the hospital’s activity' it contained 20 prisoners on average. The IDF began bringing those needing treatment to public Israeli hospitals, the report said, where they are guarded by the military police. The move was not without controversy, with a health system source telling the media outlet that 'A dedicated hospitalization facility for terrorists needs to be established' to prevent 'all terrorists' from being treated in Israel. The medical compound in Sde Teiman, the site where up to about a thousand Gazan terrorists have been held at a time after being caught during military operations in the Strip, was established towards the beginning of the war after large numbers of Israelis protested over wounded terrorists being treated in Israeli hospitals alongside injured IDF soldiers and civilians.

Israel gears up to combat lawfare against IDF soldiers abroad	As many as 50 police complaints have been filed, including the one in Brazil where a reservist fled before he was arrested. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An inter-ministry desk has been formed to analyze and combat the danger of legal action against IDF soldiers traveling in foreign countries, Haaretz reported Sunday. The report came after a Brazilian court ordered police Friday to launch an investigation into war crimes allegations against an Israeli tourist for his actions in the Gaza Strip as an IDF soldier. The Israeli foreign ministry warned the soldier about the arrest warrant and he managed to leave the country safely. The joint team from the Military Attorney General's Office, Foreign Ministry, IDF and the Shin Bet internal security service examines the risk to soldiers abroad of having such investigations opened against them, based on complaints filed by pro-Palestinian groups. These groups methodically comb through social media to find posts, videos and pictures that soldiers upload depicting their combat service, in order to use them to accuse the fighters of committing war crimes in Gaza. At least twelve complaints have been filed already, besides the one in Brazil, Channel 12 reported Sunday, in such countries as Belgium, Cyprus, Ireland, the Netherlands, Serbia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Haaretz’s list included France and South Africa. Channel 11 reported that since the beginning of the war, about 50 complaints have been filed against reservists, with 10 being investigated. Israeli officials are reportedly working hard with their foreign counterparts to limit the legal action. In most countries there is no current danger of mass arrests, the outlet said, and no official guidelines have been issued yet prohibiting travel to specific places. If an arrest does occur, the government is preparing to work with local law firms to assist the soldier immediately, Haaretz reported. Israeli officials have also warned travelers to reconsider their trips when they felt they were especially vulnerable, either because they were also citizens of the countries they were going to visit, or if intelligence was received regarding a specific person. Those most at risk would likely be reservists, as the IDF cannot control their visits abroad as they can the movements of conscripts and standing army personnel. The legal danger posed by posting online statements in favor of the war or clips of destroying Hamas-linked buildings in Gaza is a self-inflicted one that both the Foreign Ministry and IDF have warned against. The army seems to have little control over the phenomenon, even though a blanket directive has been given to reduce the soldiers' social media presence. Channel 11 reported that data from the IDF's Information Security Directorate reveals that IDF service members upload about a million items to social media every day.

Ancient monastery uncovered in southern Israel	1,500-year-old Byzantine monastery, featuring mosaic with Greek inscription of a verse from the Book of Deuteronomy, discovered near Kiryat Gat. By World Israel News Staff An ancient Christian monastery, dating back to the Byzantine period, was discovered in southern Israel recently, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced Monday morning. During excavations north of Kiryat Gat, conducted ahead of plans to build a new neighborhood, IAA teams discovered a colorful monastery floor, along with a Greek inscription of a biblical verse. The excavation revealed the remains of at least ten buildings, including the monastery, the winepress and a large warehouse building. The monastery is dated to the Byzantine period (5th-6th centuries CE), and it is part of an ancient site that already existed during the Roman period and continued for approximately 600 years. The findings revealed in the monastery and its environs include a great quantity of imported ware, coins, marble elements, metal and glass vessels, all attesting to the rich and significant community living here. The monastery’s mosaic floor features crosses, lions, doves, an amphora (a ceramic maritime shipping jug), flowers and geometric patterns. In its center, the ancient inscription in Greek was set — 'Blessed are you when you come in, and blessed are you when you go out' (Deuteronomy 28:6). The mosaic’s geometric patterns incorporate very small mosaic stones, which served to highlight the cross-shaped decorations. In addition to the monastery, a very sophisticated wine press was also uncovered, which was built and repaired several times over the years. The mosaic flooring of the fermentation rooms and the collecting vat integrated blue and white stones. In the plastered surfaces of the collecting vats you can see remnants of red paint. The northern collecting vat floor is built of slabs, upon some of which can be still be seen Greek letters, which served as masonry marks for the winepress builders. All of these features indicate that building and developing this winery involved significant financial resources, time, and a range of professional work and effort. According to Shira Lifshitz and Maayan Margulis, excavation managers on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, 'The early settlement is sited on a central road junction connecting the mountain region to the coastal plain.' 'It apparently served the area’s smaller settlements as well as travelers passing by. This is the largest and most significant Roman and Byzantine period site uncovered in this area. The findings indicate a succession of settlement starting from the early Roman period (1st century CE) and through until the end of the Byzantine period (end of the 6th century CE).' The Roman period settlement remains are more limited, but even they display richness in the variety and quality of the finds. In the Byzantine period one can see the settlement’s significant expansion, which included the construction of the monastery and the winepress. In addition, there is much evidence of local pottery production, such as detritus typical of a ceramic factory, garbage pits, misshapen vessels that were flawed in production, and even a number of vessels unique to this site. 'The discovery of the site highlights the historical richness of Kiryat Gat and its surroundings, shedding light on the centrality of the region in antiquity,' said Svetlana Talis, Director of the Southern Region at the Israel Antiquities Authority. 'The mosaic floor will be relocated to an open area in the city and made accessible to the public.' 'The mosaic discovered in Kiryat Gat is one of the most unique ever found in Israel,' adds Mark Avrahami, Head of Artistic Conservation at the Israel Antiquities Authority. 'Transferring mosaics is a complex process that requires great skill and precision. Soon, the ancient mosaic will be moved to the Israel Antiquities Authority's mosaic workshop for preservation before being displayed in the city.'

3 dead in drive-by shooting attack in Samaria	Three people murdered after terrorists open fire on a bus and private cars between the Israeli towns of Kedumim and Karnei Shomron in Samaria. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News At least nine people were wounded, including three fatally, in a shooting attack on a road in Samaria Monday morning. The attack took place when terrorists driving in a passing car opened fire on several Israeli vehicles on Route 55 in central Samaria, near the Palestinian Authority-administered town of Al Funduq, between the Israeli towns of Kedumim and Karnei Shomron. At least four Israeli vehicles were hit by gunfire during the attack, including three private cars and a passenger bus. Immediately after the shooting attack, the terrorists fled the scene in their vehicle. The IDF confirmed the attack, and said that security forces have been dispatched to the scene and that a manhunt has been launched for the perpetrators. 'Following the initial report, terrorists opened fire toward a civilian bus and vehicles adjacent to Al Funduq,' an army spokesperson said. 'As a result of the attack, a number of civilians were injured to varying degrees and are currently receiving medical treatment. Israeli Security Forces are pursuing the terrorists, setting up roadblocks and encircling several towns in the area.' Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah have been called to the scene to treat the victims and evacuate them to hospitals for treatment. According to preliminary reports, a total of nine people were wounded in the attack. Of those, three were initially listed in critical condition, before succumbing to their wounds. They include one man and two women. The six other victims are listed in conditions ranging from serious to light.

‘Jews are damned, have gone astray’ – Syrian school curriculum	The changes, which were posted on the Education Ministry's Facebook page, sparked near-instant backlash. By World Israel News Staff Changes made by Syria's new government the country's school curriculum have raised serious concerns, after lesson plans were edited to include messages condemning those who do not follow Islam. Islamist rebels recently ousted longtime leader Bashar al-Assad, who had long promoted secularism in the country and within its institutions, in a flash offensive. The current caretaker leader of Syria, Ahmad Al-Sharaa, who was previously affiliated with Al-Qaeda, has repeatedly claimed that Syria will grant full rights to all of its citizens, regardless of their faith. But changes to lesson plans posted online suggested that Syria's education system is currently undergoing an Islamic revamp. Lessons about evolution and the origins of life have been entirely removed from the curriculum, CNN reported. A document specifying edits to lesson plans showed language changed in a way that clearly states non-Muslims are misguided. The phrase 'path of goodness' was changed to 'Islamic path,' and 'those who have are damned and have gone astray' to 'Jews and Christians.' The changes, which were posted on the Education Ministry's Facebook page, sparked near-instant backlash. 'The current government is a caretaker government that does not have the right to make these amendments to the curricula,' one Syrian wrote in response on the ministry’s Facebook post. 'The curricula must be amended in accordance with the new constitution.' Another Syrian commented, 'How long does it take to write a constitution? [The Islamic rebel groups] are telling us three to four years. Time it takes to change the national curriculum? Three hours. What a farce.' In a statement, Education Minister Nazir Mohammad al-Qadri downplayed the changes. He claimed that he had only ordered 'the removal of content glorifying the deposed Assad regime and replaced images of the regime’s flag with those of the Syrian revolution’s flag in all textbooks.'

Lebanon: IDF troops on territory are ‘danger to regional stabilit...	If the IDF remains in Lebanon past the 60-day deadline, there will be 'serious problems,' warns Lebanese official. By World Israel News Staff The Lebanese government is concerned by the likelihood that Israeli troops will remain on the ground in the country after the 60-day ceasefire expires at the end of January, despite a stipulation in the truce requiring the IDF to withdraw from the region. Israel has repeatedly signaled in recent days that it will probably maintain a troop presence in southern Lebanon for the foreseeable future, as the Lebanese Army has failed to drive Hezbollah operatives north of the Litani River and the terror organization appears to be regrouping in the area. Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati is currently attempting to garner international support to pressure Israel to withdraw, a source told Saudi outlet Asharq Al-Awsat. Mikati is warning that a continued IDF presence in southern Lebanon constitutes a 'danger to regional stability,' the source said. Since the implementation of the ceasefire in late November, Israel has continued carrying out airstrikes against threats, such as Hezbollah operatives and infrastructure in areas near the border. A Lebanese official complained to Arabic-language newspaper Al-Diyar that Jerusalem's continued military activity in southern Lebanon is tantamount to 'continuing the war as though the truce hadn't been signed.' The official added that if Israeli troops remain on Lebanese soil past the 60-day deadline, 'there will be serious complications and serious problems.' During a tour of the northern border on Sunday, Defense Minister Israel Katz stressed that Israel would continue to act in order to protect its national security. 'If Hezbollah does not withdraw beyond the Litani River, there will be no ceasefire, and Israel will act on its own to ensure the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes,' Katz said. He added that 'we will not allow a renewed threat to be created against the northern communities and the citizens of the State of Israel.'

Hamas claims it provided a list of 34 hostages, Israel denies it	The Hamas source also told Reuters that any hostage release deal is contingent on Israel withdrawing its troops from Gaza. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas told Reuters that it has provided a list of 34 hostages, but Israel has denied the claim. The Hamas source also told Reuters that any hostage release deal is contingent on Israel withdrawing its troops from Gaza. Israel has denied this report that Hamas has given a list of 34 hostages. As of now, Hamas has not given a list of hostages,' says the Prime Minister's Office in a statement. Channel 12 reported that Hamas did show a list of hostages, but did not indicate who on the list was still alive. Previously, it was reported that Israel gave Hamas a list of 34 hostages it wanted to be released in the first phase of a hostage release and prisoner exchange deal. However, Hamas agreed to release only 22, including elderly and female hostages, and refused to release any men of military age Israel had demanded. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said that Israel will not commit to a complete end of the war and a withdrawal of IDF soldiers at the outset, but has agreed to a phased deal with a temporary pause in fighting to allow the release of hostages. Last week, Netanyahu said The Hamas terror organization is not taking hostage deal and ceasefire talks in Doha, Qatar seriously and 'does not want' to reach an agreement. Hamas 'does not want there to be a deal,' Netanyahu said, according to a report by The Jerusalem Post. In an interview with The New York Times, outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken denied Netanyahu was responsible for the impasse in a hostage agreement. He said he was 'astonished' the world wasn't putting more pressure on Hamas. 'One of the things that I found a little astounding … you hear virtually nothing from anyone since Oct. 7 about Hamas.' He added, 'Why there hasn't been a unanimous chorus around the world for Hamas to put down its weapons, to give up the hostages, to surrender — I don't know what the answer is to that. Israel, on various occasions has offered safe passage to Hamas's leadership and fighters out of Gaza. Where is the world?'

Blinken: World pressure on Israel caused Hamas to reject hostage ...	Blinken said he believed Hamas wanted to forestall a hostage and ceasefire deal to expand the conflict from Israel and Gaza to Iran and its terror proxy groups. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told The New York Times that world pressure on Israel harmed hostage release deals and encouraged Hamas to repeatedly reject them while laying the blame at Israel's feet. Blinken described how public international pressure on Israel motivated Hamas to back off from hostage deals. 'Whenever there has been public daylight between the United States and Israel and the perception that pressure was growing on Israel, we've seen it: Hamas has pulled back from agreeing to a ceasefire and the release of hostages.' Blinken said he believed Hamas wanted to forestall a hostage and ceasefire deal to expand the conflict from Israel and Gaza to Iran and its terror proxy groups. Blinken said, 'Hamas, when they saw Israel under pressure publicly, they pulled back. The other thing that got Hamas to pull back was their belief, their hope that there would be a wider conflict, that Hezbollah would attack Israel, that Iran would attack Israel, that other actors would attack Israel, and that Israel would have its hands full. Hamas could continue what it was doing. So we've worked very hard to make sure that that didn't happen.' When the New York Times interviewer alleged that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created obstacles to a hostage release deal in July, Blinken refuted the claim and defended Netanyahu. Blinken said, 'What we've seen time and again is Hamas not concluding a deal that it should have concluded. There have been times when actions that Israel has taken have, yes, made it more difficult. But there's been a rationale for those actions.' The outgoing Secretary of State said it was 'astounding' that world opinion focused on blaming Israel for the lack of a hostage agreement and ceasefire rather than Hamas. Blinken explained, 'One of the things that I found a little astounding &#8230; you hear virtually nothing from anyone since Oct. 7 about Hamas.' He added, 'Why there hasn't been a unanimous chorus around the world for Hamas to put down its weapons, to give up the hostages, to surrender — I don't know what the answer is to that.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A Middle Eastern Affairs researcher has pointed out that hours before the invasion and massacre on October 7th, 2023, Hamas posted on Telegram warnings about the impending attack. Lt. Col. (res.) Jonathan Dahoah-Halevi, a senior researcher on Middle East affairs and radical Islam at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, published the report. The report revealed that detailed information about the attacks was posted prior to October 7th on the Telegram channel 'Military Tactics' connected with the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military force of Hamas. Dahoah-Halevy stated that had this information been detected, analyzed, and processed by Israeli intelligence, the IDF might have been more prepared to respond to the Hamas attack. One of the messages sent shortly after midnight said, 'The 5,12 people of the dawn are the people of Allah.' This may seem on the surface to be an encouragement to wake early and pray, but Dahoah-Halevy explains that the time 5:12 is a hint that their followers should be ready not only to pray to Allah but to attack Israel. A second message posted at 00:22 said, 'We say to the Zionist enemy, no one has previously experienced the [operation] that will come to you.' A few seconds later, another post said, 'There are many, many, many, many, many surprises.' Other messages sent throughout the night and in the early morning hours said, 'We swear by Allah, we will humiliate you and annihilate you completely, and you will suffer in the next stages, you and your faint-hearted settlers.' It continued: 'The pure guns are ready, and your heads are the target.' 'We will fight you in all [fighting] arenas, and the Al-Qassam Brigades [Hamas] and the Al-Quds Brigades [Islamic Jihad] will boom with the thunder of gunfire and explosions in every [fighting] arena. The media chatter endlessly about the number of dead and seriously wounded among the enemy.' 'Your attacks against the Al-Aqsa [Mosque] recently will be redoubled on you with fire and flames,' it added. 'You have been warned. What is about to happen will be a massive [event].' The Telegram channel also posted warnings as early as September 17th, threatening Israels living in the Gaza envelope. One message said, 'No one will be able to give you the security you dream of. Soon, you will witness the blood of your soldiers staining the fangs of our lions. A major security incident is coming, and it will be soon.'

Iran armed the Houthis for ‘years’ of attacks against Israel	Some experts suggest the only path to neutralizing the Houthi threat lies in eliminating its leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. By Jewish Breaking News With Hamas and Hezbollah taking heavy losses from Israeli forces, Iran has begun funneling more weapons to its Houthi terror proxy. As part of its global jihad, the Islamic Republic has provided the Houthis with enough military supplies to sustain attacks on Israel and international shipping routes for 'years to come,' Yemen’s military spokesman Abdul Basit Al-Baher tells The Telegraph. 'This is clear evidence that Iran is increasing its support for the Houthis after the weakening of Hamas and Hezbollah and the fall of the Assad regime in the region,' he said, noting the Houthis have received from Iran 'high-level missiles and aircraft' alongside 'workshops for assembling and manufacturing drones and developing missiles.' In spite of fierce Israeli bombardment and joint U.S.-British strikes against their weapons facilities, Houthi terrorists managed to launch their sixth missile attack on Israel last Thursday in a span of less than two weeks. The Houthis currently control territory containing roughly 80 percent of Yemen’s population, presenting a formidable challenge for Israel’s intelligence gathering. Coupled with distance and lack of a shared border, the IDF is reportedly relying on allied tribal sources and the Yemeni government for intelligence information. Israeli security sources, who previously dismissed the Houthis as a regional nuisance, now acknowledge being caught flat-footed. 'All the time, we were under the conception that the Houthis weren’t an Israeli problem, more for the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE,' one intelligence source admitted. 'They don’t have the capacity of Hezbollah, but still, they have their own production. Some of that was hit by the US-UK attacks but not all of it, and it’s scattered around Yemen so it’s not easy to locate or tackle as it’s not in one place,' he said. 'But I don’t see this being able to continue for years.' Some experts suggest the only path to neutralizing the Houthi threat lies in eliminating its leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. 'The Houthis’ whole regime is one Shiite tribe which relies on its megalomaniac leader, and if Israel and the allies eliminate Abdul-Malik and his brother, the whole regime will collapse,' another Israeli security source tells The Telegraph. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s return to office is expected to trigger intensified strikes against the Houthis, particularly given Trump’s pledge to reapply 'maximum pressure' against Iran and their terror proxies throughout the Middle East.

High Court: Israel can retain bodies of slain terrorists for pote...	Justice David Mintz emphasized the court’s limited authority to intervene in security-related government decisions, noting intervention is reserved for extreme circumstances. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel’s High Court of Justice unanimously ruled on Sunday that the state is not obligated to release for burial the bodies of slain terrorists who were Israeli citizens. The decision upheld the state’s position that retaining these bodies may be necessary for potential negotiations to secure the return of Israeli hostages and deceased individuals held by Hamas in Gaza. The ruling followed six petitions filed last year by relatives of the deceased. The petitioners argued the policy was unlawful, exceeded legal authority, and inflicted significant harm on the dignity of both the deceased and their families. The state contended that negotiations for hostages and the dead are in a sensitive and dynamic phase. It maintained that retaining the bodies remains a critical option for advancing these talks. Justice David Mintz, writing for the three-judge panel, emphasized the court’s limited authority to intervene in security-related government decisions, noting intervention is reserved for extreme circumstances. He further cited a 1945 regulation granting the military commander authority to withhold the release of terrorist bodies, a power affirmed by a prior court ruling to apply to Israeli citizens. Mintz concluded that the government’s decision is a temporary measure subject to ongoing cabinet review. Given the current security landscape and the evolving nature of negotiations, the court found no grounds for interference.

Israeli embassy original target in Taylor Swift terror plot	The plot’s discovery triggered one of 2024’s largest counter-terrorism investigations, involving intelligence and law enforcement agencies from at least six countries, the Post reported. By Erez Linn, JNS In a chilling revelation of threats facing Israeli diplomatic missions, a 19-year-old ISIS supporter considered attacking the Israeli embassy in Vienna before planning to target a Taylor Swift concert, The Washington Post reported on Sunday. The case highlights security concerns for Israeli interests in Europe. Before settling on the concert venue as his target, Beran Aliji, a dual citizen of Austria and North Macedonia, had carefully evaluated other high-profile locations, including the Israeli embassy, Kurdish diplomats and a Shi’ite mosque, according to police records obtained by the newspaper. The discovery prompted heightened security measures at Israeli diplomatic facilities across Europe, as investigators uncovered evidence of Aliji’s extensive consumption of terrorist propaganda and his pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State. By July, amid what he described as a mental-health crisis, the Austrian teenager quit his factory apprenticeship and isolated himself in his apartment, becoming obsessed with thoughts of death, he later told police. Without money or prospects, and lacking close friendships, he immersed himself in violent videos and secret chatrooms devoted to the Islamic State. 'These are bitter, angry people,' Bruce Riedel, a counter-terrorism expert and 30-year veteran of the CIA, said. The case reflects a broader pattern of self-radicalization that concerns Israeli and Western security officials. The investigation revealed hundreds of text messages and multiple police reports showing how Aliji sought guidance from individuals he believed to be Islamic State members. 'My operation is to take place at a big concert,' he wrote in one message, according to Austrian records. 'I will try to get a gun and bombs. If that doesn’t work, I will use big knives. Or I will kill a police officer and take his rifle.' The plot’s discovery triggered one of 2024’s largest counter-terrorism investigations, involving intelligence and law enforcement agencies from at least six countries, the Post reported. While initial speculation connected the plot to tensions surrounding Gaza, investigators found it stemmed from personal instability and online radicalization. A senior European counterterrorism official, speaking anonymously due to the sensitive nature of ongoing investigations, noted that the ranks of the radicalized are growing 'younger and younger.' The official expressed particular concern about children watching execution videos and following extremist influencers at an early age. Islamic State and Al-Qaeda Unable to secure weapons due to financial constraints, Aliji tried to manufacture explosives in his apartment. He managed to produce only a small amount of triacetone triperoxide (TATP), which experts later determined was insufficient to cause serious damage. Police discovered dozens of Islamic State and Al-Qaeda propaganda videos on Aliji’s phone, including beheading recordings. His school reported concerning behavior during his final year, with staff noting misogynistic and antisocial tendencies that made them fear he was becoming 'extremely dangerous.' The investigation intensified after Aliji sought direct guidance from someone he believed to be an Islamic State official known as 'Abu Omar.' These communications were monitored by intelligence agencies, leading to the CIA helping alert Austrian authorities to the plot. Austrian SWAT teams stormed Aliji’s apartment on Aug. 7, after evacuating nearby homes due to concerns about explosives. His 17-year-old friend, a male Austrian citizen of Turkish and Croatian descent who worked for the concert’s security company, was arrested the same day. Werner Tomanek, Aliji’s Viennese lawyer, declined to comment beyond noting that there were 'no official accusations, but only a working hypothesis of the public prosecutor’s office.' Rita Katz, founder of SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist online activity, said, 'ISIS is still very relevant, especially for the young generation. You can find them online more easily than a few years ago.' The Taylor Swift concerts were subsequently canceled, with her later expressing gratitude to law enforcement on Instagram for preventing tragedy. 'Thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives,' Swift wrote.

Jerusalem terror attack: Arab janitor strangled, stabbed Israeli ...	Israeli investigators say attempted murder of Israeli woman by an east Jerusalem janitor was a terror attack. By World Israel News Staff A violent assault on an elderly Israeli woman in her apartment in central Jerusalem was a nationalistically-motivated terror attack, Israeli authorities declared Sunday. On Sunday afternoon, Israeli police and the Shin Bet internal security agency released a joint statement declaring that the attempted murder of a 74-year-old Jerusalem woman by an Arab janitor was a terror attack, not a mere armed robbery. The attack occurred on December 19th, when the suspect, a 60-year-old resident of east Jerusalem arrived at the home of his victim, ostensibly to do cleaning and maintenance work. The suspect, from Jerusalem's Silwan neighborhood, worked as the janitor for the apartment building where the victim lived. He had performed work for the victim in the past, and was supposed to finish repairs in her apartment when he arrived there on December 19th. Rather than complete his work, however, the suspect strangled the woman, attempting to murder her. He then left the apartment, before returning shortly thereafter, when he realized he had forgotten his walking stick in her apartment. Upon his arrival, the terrorist discovered that his victim had not died in the attack. He found a knife in a drawer in the victim's apartment and stabbed her repeatedly, with the intention of murdering her. Believing the woman to be fatally injured, he stole her jewelry and left her apartment. The victim, despite her wounds, was able to call her daughter for assistance. Meanwhile the terrorist sold the stolen goods at an east Jerusalem pawn shop and fled to Samaria. Within hours, Israeli authorities located the terrorist and arrested him During his interrogation, investigators ascertained that the suspect had attempted to murder the woman on nationalistic grounds, over his anger regarding the war in Gaza, rather than as part of a planned robbery. The terrorist was brought before a Jerusalem court Sunday for an extension of his detention, pending the filing of an indictment against him later this week.

Islamist party offers to back Netanyahu government	The United Arab List, affiliated with the Southern Islamic Movement, offers to give Netanyahu a 'safety net' in the Knesset if the prime minister's right-wing allies balk at a ceasefire deal with Hamas. By World Israel News Staff An Arab-Israeli party aligned with a controversial Islamist movement has offered to support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government in the Knesset, should Netanyahu face opposition from some of his coalition allies over a possible ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas. Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, who lead the Religious Zionist Party and Otzma Yehudit factions, have expressed opposition to any deal with Hamas that would include major concessions, such as the freeing of prominent jailed Palestinian terrorists, an IDF withdrawal from most of the Gaza Strip, and a permanent end to the war in the Gaza Strip. On Saturday night, MK Mansour Abbas, chairman of the United Arab List (Ra'am) told Israel's Channel 12 that his party's five Knesset members could provide Netanyahu with a parliamentary 'safety net' should Ben-Gvir and Smotrich attempt to either topple the government or block passage of a hostage deal in the Knesset. 'The Zionist parties, led by Benny Gantz, can take such steps. If a government comes that will bring them home and stop the war – the United Arab List will provide a safety net,' Abbas said. While Abbas criticized the current government, calling it 'bad,' he emphasized his support for any effort to secure a hostage deal and an end to the war in Gaza. Abbas also rejected calls for early elections, saying the country needs political stability, suggesting that opposition leaders could form a new unity government with Netanyahu 'that will complete the term, bring back the hostages, stop the war, rehabilitate the south and the north, and also address the issue of crime in Arab society.' 'It is very sad that we are entering 2025 with the hostages still held captive in the Gaza Strip. The composition of this government will not bring back the hostages, and therefore a different government composition is needed.'

IDF soldier, survivor of Oct 7th massacre, flees Brazil ahead of ...	Israeli man targeted in war crimes probe in Brazil manages to flee the country prior to opening of criminal investigation. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News An Israeli tourist who has been targeted by a war crimes probe while visiting Brazil has managed to leave the country before the formal opening of the investigation, crossing the border to ensure he avoids detention abroad, Brazilian media outlets reported over the weekend. On Friday, the Federal Court for Brazil's Federal District ordered police to launch an investigation into war crimes allegations against an Israeli tourist visiting the country on a tourist visa, over his actions in the Gaza Strip as an IDF soldier. The probe was initiated in response to a petition by the Hind Rajab Foundation, an anti-Israel Brussels-based organization which lobbies foreign governments and law enforcement agencies to take action against Israeli officials and IDF soldiers. The foundation accused the soldier in question of taking part in demolition operations in the Gaza Strip during the ongoing war against Hamas. The Israeli foreign ministry warned the soldier and a traveling companion that Brazilian authorities had issued a warrant for his arrest. Early Sunday morning the soldier notified his father that he had left the country, the soldier's father told Israel's Channel 12. 'I asked them to escape immediately and not stay even a moment longer,' he said. 'I believe they’ll find their way home safely, but we need to make sure they know the truth about the soldier. He’s not a suspect; he’s a soldier who’s been through hell.' The soldier has been identified as a survivor of the Nova Music Festival massacre at Re'im, the largest of the October 7th, 2023 massacres. A total of 364 people were murdered during the attack on the festival, with hundreds wounded and dozens taken hostage. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid condemned the investigation against the soldier, while also accusing the Israeli government of failing to protect IDF soldiers abroad. 'The fact that an Israeli reservist was forced to flee Brazil in the dead of night to avoid being arrested for fighting in Gaza is a huge political failure by an irresponsible government that simply doesn't know how to function,' Lapid tweeted. 'How did we get to the point where the Palestinians are better than the Israeli government in the international arena?'

Trump administration plans crippling sanctions on ICC	The incoming administration’s strategy extends beyond unilateral actions, as it plans to secure commitments from U.S. allies to reject cooperation with arrest warrants targeting Israeli officials. By Ariel Kahana, JNS President-elect Donald Trump plans to implement devastating sanctions against the International Criminal Court in The Hague immediately after taking office, sources close to the matter disclosed to Israel Hayom. These executive orders could be unveiled as soon as Jan. 21. The sanctions package will target both individual ICC personnel, including judges and prosecutors, and the institution as a whole. The administration intends to classify the ICC as an organization threatening U.S. interests, employing designation procedures similar to those used by the State Department for terrorist organizations globally. This designation will trigger severe restrictions on anyone involved with the court’s operations. Financial institutions worldwide will be required to terminate relationships with ICC personnel or face U.S. sanctions themselves. Mirroring actions taken against sanctioned Israeli citizens by the outgoing administration, ICC staff will find themselves unable to perform routine banking operations or use credit cards. Their financial activities will be effectively frozen, with exceptions only for essential needs such as food purchases. Furthermore, all U.S.-based assets belonging to ICC employees and the institution will be frozen. The incoming administration’s strategy extends beyond unilateral actions, as it plans to secure commitments from U.S. allies to reject cooperation with arrest warrants targeting Israeli officials. These measures aim to create conditions allowing the court to independently withdraw its arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Officials hope that during appeal proceedings, either Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan or the judges will identify legal grounds to rescind these warrants. The incoming administration considers the ICC’s arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant a direct threat to U.S. national security. The incoming officials believe these actions ultimately seek to strip the U.S. and its allies of their ability to mount military defenses against global threats. Trump administration officials and Republican senators widely view Israel’s situation as a precedent, believing the U.S. could face similar warrants next, leading them to treat these actions against Israeli officials as precursors to targeting American leadership and military command. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who will lead the Senate Intelligence Committee starting this week, said that 'the ICC is a ‘kangaroo court’ and Karim Khan is a deranged zealot. Woe to him and anyone who tries to enforce these lawless warrants. Let me give everyone a friendly reminder: The U.S. law on ICC is known as the ‘Hague Invasion Act,’ and there’s a reason for that. Think about it.'

Israeli forces uncover weapons in Syrian demilitarized zone	Israel sent forces into the 235 sq km buffer zone to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border when the regime of Bashar Assad collapsed in December. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli soldiers on the Syrian side of a strategic peak in the demilitarized zone discovered a 'significant cache' of weapons, the Israel Defense Forces said on Sunday. The IDF’s 'Mountain Brigade' discovered military structures and control points on the Syrian side of Mount Hermon, the highest peak in the Golan Heights. Troops uncovered and neutralized what the army said was a 'significant cache of weapons and intelligence assets,' including rockets, launchers, anti-tank missiles, mines and explosive charges. Israel sent forces into the 235 sq km buffer zone to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border when the regime of Bashar Assad collapsed in December. The move into the demilitarized zone was coordinated with peacekeepers from the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF). Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar met with UNDOF commanders on Thursday. Israeli officials say they will remain in the demilitarized zone for as long as necessary. While Israeli forces have briefly entered the buffer zone in the past, December’s takeover marked the first time since its establishment that the IDF set up positions there. The demilitarized zone was established with a ceasefire in 1974 that ended the Yom Kippur War. Israel considers the 1974 ceasefire agreement void until order is restored in Syria.

Congress is notified by the Biden administration of a planned $8 ...	The weapons package would add to a record of at least $17.9 billion in military aid that the U.S. has provided Israel. By The Associated Press The State Department has informed Congress of a planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel, U.S. officials say, as the American ally presses forward with its war against Hamas in Gaza. Some of the arms in the package could be sent through current U.S. stocks but the majority would take a year or several years to deliver, according to two U.S. officials Saturday who spoke on condition of anonymity because the notification to Congress hasn’t been formally sent. The sale includes medium-range air-to-air missiles to help Israel defend against airborne threats, 155 mm projectile artillery shells for long-range targeting, Hellfire AGM-114 missiles, 500-pound bombs and more. The weapons package would add to a record of at least $17.9 billion in military aid that the U.S. has provided Israel since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, launched the war. There have been unsuccessful efforts in Congress by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and some Democrats to block sales of offensive weapons to Israel. The United States paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in May to force the Jewish nation not to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The Biden administration has demanded that Israel increase humanitarian aid into the enclave. But in November, citing some limited progress, it declined to limit arms transfers as it threatened to do if the situation did not improve. The Israeli army said Friday that it had struck dozens of Hamas gathering points and command centers throughout Gaza. Israel’s military says it only targets terrorists and Howdy, Yossi Lichtblames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Winter has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near the sea. The informal notice to Congress isn’t the final notification before a sale. Now the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can review the package. News of the weapons sale was first reported by Axios.

IDF downs Houthi missile fired from Yemen	Houthi terrorists have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since Oct. 7, 2023. By JNS The Israeli Air Force intercepted a missile fired by Houthi terrorists in Yemen overnight Saturday. The projectile was shot down before entering Israeli airspace, the IDF said. Air-raid sirens sounded in Moshav Talmei Elazar, located east of Hadera and southeast of Caesarea, but not throughout the central region as was the case in several other recent attacks. document.createElement('video'); The IDF overnight Thursday downed a Houthi missile that triggered air-raid sirens across the country, including in Jerusalem, the greater Tel Aviv area and parts of Judea. Flights in and out of Ben-Gurion International Airport were halted for about 30 minutes due to that attack, with two planes diverting to Larnaca in Cyprus. Hours later, the military said that the Air Force had intercepted a drone launched from Yemen. Houthi terrorists have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the terrorist invasion of the northwestern Negev on Oct. 7, 2023. On Dec. 26, the Israeli Air Force conducted strikes on the western coast of and deep inside Yemen, including at Sanaa International Airport in the Houthi-controlled capital. The targets included the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations, in addition to terrorist infrastructure in the Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports. 'These military targets were used by the Houthi terrorist regime to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials. This is a further example of the Houthis’ exploitation of civilian infrastructure for military purposes,' the IDF said.

Israelis injured in New Orleans attack ID’d as reservists vacatio...	The pair of friends had gone traveling to 'clear their heads' and have fun in the U.S. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The two Israelis who were injured in the New Orleans terror attack last week were a pair of reservists who had battled Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists for most of the war and had gone on a trip afterward to 'clear their heads,' The New York Post reported Saturday. Israel’s consul general the Southwest United States, Elad Shoshan told the paper that the pair were 'best friends' in their mid-to-late twenties who had served for over a year and were traveling for fun after their stressful service. 'They came here to relax, to travel. Now that interrupted in the most horrific way,' Shoshan said, calling it a 'tragic irony' that they had been hurt on holiday and not while doing battle. 'They left the terror of one country and never expected to be victims of it in another,' he told the paper. One is still in serious condition, having suffered head trauma that has already required two 'life-saving' operations, the consul general said. He will need more surgeries for other injuries as well. 'He’s in severe pain all over his body,' said Shoshan, who flew to the hospital from his base in Houston, Texas to offer any official help he could immediately after it became known that Israelis had been hurt. The second man is in moderate but stable condition, having undergone two operations for internal injuries. Shoshan described how the man emotionally said the Shema prayer for his critically injured friend’s full recovery. New Orleans had been the reservists’ second to-last stop of their six-week visit before returning to Israel. Their families, who flew from Israel to be at their sides, prefer that their names be withheld at this time. They are being warmly supported by the local Jewish community, which is some 12,000 strong. 'The road ahead will be challenging, but we remain optimistic and remain hopeful for their speedy recovery,' the father of the severely injured Israeli told the paper. The two men had been partying on the streets of the city’s historic French Quarter early Wednesday morning, celebrating New Year’s Eve along with hundreds of others when Texan Shamsud-Din Jabbar rammed a rented pick-up truck into the revelers. He then got out and started shooting people, murdering 14 and injuring some 30 others in total, including at least two police officers, before being killed by their colleagues. An FBI investigation found that the former IT specialist for the American army, who served for almost a year in Afghanistan, had booked the truck rental in mid-November, suggesting that he had been planning the attack for at least six weeks. On Friday, the federal agency said that two improvised explosive devices had also been planted in coolers in the area of the historic French Quarter where the ramming took place, and the transmitter to detonate them were found in Jabbar’s truck. Bomb-making materials were also found in the nearby Airbnb home he had rented and had tried to burn down unsuccessfully before setting out on his killing spree. Jabbar had posted videos online saying that he had joined the ISIS terror organization, and during a search of his Houston home, the authorities found a Quran open to a verse about martyrdom. Shoshan said that Israel and the U.S. are fighting 'the same ideology, the same enemy,' equating ISIS with Hamas, both of which are Muslim extremist groups, as the IDF continues to battle Hamas after its terrorists led an invasion and massacre of 1,200 last October 7.

Israeli military preparing for ‘extreme’ Iranian attack – report	IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi reportedly placing Israeli military on high alert, amid intelligence suggesting Iran planning 'extreme' attack on Israel ahead of President-elect Trump's inauguration later this month. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military has been placed on high alert and is preparing to respond to possible 'extreme' steps by Iran against the Jewish state in the immediate future, according to a report by the Israeli media outlet Walla. According to the report, which cited Israeli defense officials, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi has instructed top brass to draft plans to respond to various possible Iranian attacks on Israel, amid fears Tehran may attempt to carry out a major assault in a matter of days, ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20th. The IDF is reportedly concerned that given Iran's increasingly tenuous position - including a major economic downturn, energy shortages, popular dissent, and the prospect of a fresh wave of sanctions from the incoming Trump administration - Tehran may act out of desperation to shore up the positions of its proxies across the Middle East. Iran and its allies suffered devastating losses across the region during 2024, including not only the decimation of Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip, but also the destruction of much of Hezbollah's leadership and the dismantling of the organization's infrastructure in southern Lebanon, severe damage to Iran's air defense network, and the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Given these setbacks, some Israeli defense officials believe Iran could lash out at the Jewish state with 'extreme' measures. Israeli and American leaders are also preparing for an attempt by Iran to rush towards a nuclear breakout prior to Trump's inauguration. Last week, Axios reported that U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had briefed President Joe Biden on possible options for airstrikes against Iran's nuclear program, should the U.S. detect a sudden movement towards 90% uranium enrichment.

‘Christians are essential in fight against antisemitism,’ says Is...	Israel's war against Hamas is part of a larger 'clash of civilizations' between 'barbarians' and 'the free world,' says Israeli ambassador to the US, adding that 'the American people clearly stand with Israel.' By World Israel News Staff In one of his final speeches as Israel’s Ambassador to the U.S., Michael Herzog addressed hundreds of Christian students who had traveled from across North America to Washington, D.C., for a weekend of Israel advocacy organized in partnership between Inspire and Passages. Known as the 'Christian Birthright,' Passages was founded in 2016 and has since brought over 11,000 Christian students from North America to Israel for the first time. The initiative aims to strengthen religious identity and foster friendship with Israel and the Jewish people. Inspire creates digital resources and immersive experiences designed to make Bible reading simple, enjoyable and transformational for people of all ages. 'Despite all the noise and protests, after 15 months of war, my conclusion is clear: the American people stand with us,' said Ambassador Herzog. 'They understand right from wrong and recognize what is at stake. We have witnessed unprecedented political and diplomatic support from both sides of Congress, especially in combating the blood libels at the ICJ and ICC.' 'When tested, the U.S. and Israel stand united,' he continued. 'I have high expectations for continued cooperation with the incoming administration. There are two major opportunities ahead: First, pushing back against the Iranian nuclear program, which poses a grave threat to Israel, the region, the U.S., and the free world. This should begin with sanctions, but must also include a credible military option. Second, there is an opportunity to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. I believe the door is open, and this could be a game-changer.' The event took place at Museum of the Bible, where Ambassador Herzog and his wife Shirin Herzog were presented with a remarkable gift – a copy of the Afghan Liturgical Quire, the oldest Hebrew book in the world. This medieval manuscript, dating back to the 8th century, includes prayers, poems, and the oldest known Passover Haggadah. The gift was presented by Jackie & Steve Green, Co-Founder & Chairman of Museum of the Bible. 'The Afghan Liturgical Quire is one of the most cherished treasures in the museum’s collection, and it speaks to the Jewish people’s continuity, resilience and excellence,' said Green while presenting the gift to Ambassador Herzog. 'We all know that it has not been easy for you Ambassador, but you leave your position knowing that the U.S. – Israel relationship is stronger and more resilient than ever. It has withstood testing times, but Israel knows that the foundation of this special relationship is supported by the majority of Americans at all levels of society, from the people to the president and the president-elect.' 'Our Christian friends are essential in the fight against antisemitism,' Ambassador Herzog told the Christian students advocating for Israel on their campuses. 'Your advocacy, rooted in faith and the love of life, is crucial in this battle. We value life, while our enemies value death. We focus on the future, while they seek to revive the dark past.' 'This is a clash of civilizations,' he added. 'What the barbarians did to our people on October 7th cannot be explained merely in political terms. There is a deeper element to this. Our partnership with the Christian community is vital in confronting this type of war. When Israel fights its enemies, it is a battle for the free world. Our victory will be a victory for the free world. We are in this together.' The trip to DC is a stepping stone for the students to an Israel trip with Passages. They will visit Museum of the Bible, the Holocaust Memorial museum, and hear from Israeli tour guides. To close the weekend, the students will put together hundreds of 'Kits for Kids' to send to Israel for children who are forced to spend time in bomb shelters. 'Now, more than ever, we are seeing our Christian friends step up, whether by visiting Israel to show solidarity or by standing with Jewish students on North American campuses,' said Rivka Kidron, Co-Founder of Passages and former Advisor to Israel’s Prime Minister. 'Passages is working harder than ever to combat the delegitimization of the Jewish state on university campuses. As Ambassador Herzog said, when Jews and Christians stand together, we will defeat our shared enemies.' In addition to the advocacy weekend in Washington, Passages resumed its student trips to Israel, including visits to communities near the Gaza border and volunteering with those most affected by the war in northern and southern Israel.

‘An Israeli attack could spark full-scale war’ – Iranian official	After ongoing Iranian aggression, official says he hopes that 'Israel will refrain from taking reckless action.' By World Israel News Staff A senior Iranian official warned that an additional attack by Israel on its territory could trigger a 'large-scale war,' during an interview with a Chinese state-controlled news agency. 'We are fully prepared for the possibility of further Israeli attacks,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CCTV. 'I hope Israel will refrain from taking such reckless action, as it could lead to a large-scale war.' He added that Iran 'believes that reason will ultimately prevail and prevent actions that could have serious consequences.' Araghchi made the remarks in late December, while on a diplomatic visit to China, but the interview was only published on Saturday. During the visit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed his opposition to international sanctions against Iran. China, a close ally of Iran, is a critical trading partner for the country. In 2024, 91% of Iran's total exports of its sanctioned crude oil, condensates, and fuel oil went to China. Araghchi's comments came after tensions between Israel and Iran reached historic highs in 2024. In April, following the assassination of a senior IRGC commander by the IDF, Iran launched an unprecedented attack on the Jewish State. Tehran launched some 300 explosive drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted by an American-led coalition outside of Israeli airspace. A seven-year-old Bedouin-Israeli girl was severely wounded by falling shrapnel. There were no other casualties in the attack, and Israel did not respond. However, in October, Iran launched another massive missile barrage, sending virtually all of Israel's residents into bomb shelters. That attack saw a Palestinian civilian in Jericho killed by falling shrapnel. Weeks later, Israel destroyed Iran's air defense systems and UAV and missile production facilities. Four Iranian soldiers and a security guard were killed in the Israeli bombardment.

Hezbollah threatens Israel – ‘Our patience is running out’	Our patience may run out before or after the 60 days, when we decide to do something that you will see directly,' says Hezbollah chief Qassem Naim. By World Israel News Staff Hezbollah head Naim Qassem threatened that the terror group will resume hostilities against Israel during a speech on Saturday evening. Qassem, who replaced slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in late October 2024, spoke about the ongoing ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. The 60-day truce is set to expire in late January, days after incoming president-elect Donald Trump assumes office. 'There is no timetable that specifies the resistance’s work, and our patience is linked to the appropriate timing to confront the enemy,' Qassem said in a televised speech. 'Our patience may run out before or after the 60 days, when we decide to do something that you will see directly.' Israel has continued carrying out anti-terror operations in southern Lebanon during the truce, including airstrikes on Hezbollah operatives and infrastructure. Hezbollah was severely battered by the months-long conflict with Israel, which kicked off with the unprecedented beeper explosions. 'In the past, Israel reached Beirut within days, but in the 2024 aggression, it was unable to advance more than a few hundred meters at the front edge. Israel was unable to advance because the resistance fighters stood firm and stood firm in the face of it,' he says. Notably, Israel never attempted to reach any points in Lebanon north of the Litani River. Last week, Hezbollah-linked newspaper Al-Akhbar published an editorial calling for the terror group to resume its attacks against Israel. In recent days, Israel has hinted that it will not withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon at the end of the ceasefire, which had been stipulated as a condition for the truce. Israel has cited Hezbollah's attempts to regroup in the region, along with a failure by Lebanese Army troops to ensure that the area is free of Hezbollah operatives, as reasons why the IDF will likely not withdraw from the region.

Blinken threatened to call off Biden’s visit if Israel didn’t tra...	Blinken described Israeli society as 'traumatized' and unwilling to send aid to Gaza after the savage Hamas attack on October 7th. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In the days following Hamas's brutal assault on Israel on October 7, outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told The New York Times that he threatened to hold up US President Joe Biden's visit if Israel didn't immediately transfer humanitarian aid to Gaza. He described Israeli society as 'traumatized' and unwilling to send aid to Gaza after the savage Hamas attack. Blinken told the NYT, 'I spent with my team nine hours in the I.D.F.'s headquarters in Tel Aviv, six stories underground with the Israeli government, including the prime minister, including arguing for hours on end about the basic proposition that the humanitarian assistance needed to get to Palestinians in Gaza.' He added, 'Israel in the days after October 7 a traumatized society. This wasn't just the prime minister or a given leader in Israel. This was an entire society that didn't want any assistance getting to a single Palestinian in Gaza.' After Blinken tried to persuade the Israeli government to send humanitarian aid to Gaza, he then switched tactics and threatened to hold off Biden's planned trip to Israel if aid wasn't sent. 'President Biden was planning to come to Israel a few days later. And in the course of that argument, when I was getting resistance to the proposition of humanitarian assistance getting in, I told the prime minister, I'm going to call the president and tell him not to come if you don't allow this assistance to start flowing. And I called the president to make sure that he agreed with that, and he fully did,' said Blinken. He then boasted to the reporter that his threat to hold off the president's visit led to the opening of Rafah and Kerem Shalom to aid to Gaza. In several moments during the interview, the interviewer tried to convince Blinken that what was going on in Gaza was genocide, a term Blinken rejected as he insisted Israel's military efforts were to prevent another October 7 from happening. He said, 'When it comes to the actions that Israel has taken, in its just defense in trying to make sure that October 7 never happens again.' In addition, Blinken stated that he holds Hamas, not Netanyahu, responsible for the breakdown in hostage deal talks. 'What we've seen time and again is Hamas not concluding a deal that it should have concluded.' He also expressed dismay that many countries are condemning Israel for the conflict rather than Hamas. 'One of the things that I found a little astounding throughout is that for all of the understandable criticism of the way Israel has conducted itself in Gaza, you hear virtually nothing from anyone since October 7 about Hamas,' he said.

IDF investigation reveals Hamas was fully in charge of Gaza hospi...	Israel's Unit 504 investigators discovered that the hospital director was involved in planning and coordinating terror activity. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News An IDF interrogation of Hamas terrorists revealed that the terror group was in complete control of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, Gaza, N12 reports. Israel's Unit 504 investigators discovered that the hospital director was involved in planning and coordinating terror activity and that Hamas planned to escape from the hospital in ambulances when the IDF raid began. IDF and Shin Bet, Israel's security forces, raided the hospital last Friday on intelligence that terrorists using the hospital as a headquarters. Around 240 Hamas terrorists were arrested in the raid, including many who participated in the October 7th massacre. An IDF reservist describes his interrogation of a Hamas terrorist, who admitted that the hospital director was instrumental in directing terrorist activity. The reservist said, 'We discovered that the individual at the center of the event, orchestrating the terror and Hamas activities within the compound, was the hospital director himself.' The reservist added that the hospital director 'strutted around like a peacock, certain that he wouldn't be arrested and fully convinced he was in control of the situation.' Another investigator confirmed that the hospital director was a member of Hamas. The second reservist said Dr. Abu Safiyeh 'really did walk around like a peacock' and added, 'He watched as his doctors were incriminated one by one, still convinced he wouldn't face arrest.' He added, 'But we soon saw through his disguise—it was nothing more than a facade. They were terrorists with blood on their hands. The hospital director finally realized that the entire ruse had unraveled, and in the end, he too was arrested.' Working in coordination with COGAT, the IDF completed an evacuation of 350 patients and medical professionals from the facility prior to the raid. Israel's military also ensured the delivery of food, fuel, and medical supplies to keep the treatment areas functioning. In addition, 95 patients and staff were transferred to the Indonesian hospital in Gaza, along with two generators and thousands of liters of essential supplies. The 401st brigade, located around the perimeter of the hospital, arrested terrorists and eliminated those who attacked troops or resisted arrest. Israeli special forces found in the hospital an arsenal of weapons, including grenades, firearms, and other military equipment.

China feeds Houthi war machine while preaching ‘peace’ in Red Sea	A US intelligence source tells i24 News that in exchange for providing safe passage to Chinese ships, the Houthis are receiving advanced weaponry essential for their ballistic and cruise missile programs. By Jewish Breaking News China’s decades-long investment in Yemen’s infrastructure has morphed into a dangerous new phase, with U.S. intelligence sources revealing Beijing is now secretly arming Houthi terrorists with advanced missile technology for attacks on Red Sea shipping. China and Yemen’s relationship stretches back to the 1950s, with Beijing significantly expanding its economic presence in the country during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Their investments focused primarily on oil, energy, and infrastructure projects, including development of Yemen’s electrical grid. Even after civil war erupted and Saudi-led coalition forces intervened in 2015, China maintained diplomatic relations with both the official Yemeni government and Houthi rebels, while evacuating its own citizens from the conflict zone. On December 21, 2023, following two months of Houthi attacks against shipping in the Gulf of Aden Strait, China for the first time addressed the question of its intention to play a more active role in securing the Red Sea region. 'China stands for protecting the safety of international sea lanes and against causing disturbance to civilian ships. We believe relevant parties, especially major countries with influence, need to play a constructive and responsible role in keeping the shipping lanes safe in the Red Sea,' China’s Foreign Ministry stated at the time. However, it seems that China’s 'active role' means supporting terrorism. A US intelligence source tells i24 News that in exchange for providing safe passage to Chinese ships, the Houthis are receiving advanced weaponry essential for their ballistic and cruise missile programs. Washington has repeatedly confronted Chinese officials with this evidence since September, providing detailed lists of Chinese companies involved in the illegal arms transfer. Without much success so far, the United States is reportedly considering joint action with Israel to sever these Chinese trading networks from the global financial system.

New Hamas propaganda video shows hostage Liri Albag alive	Liri Albag was one of the female lookout soldiers who was taken hostage in Nahal Oz on October 7th, 2023. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A newly released Hamas propaganda video shows signs that Israeli hostage Liri Albag (19) may be alive. Albag was one of the female lookout soldiers who was taken hostage in Nahal Oz on October 7th, 2023. In the video, Liri Albag states she has been in captivity for 450 days and says, 'I'm only 19, with my whole life ahead of me, but right now it feels like everything has come to a standstill.' 'We're entering a really dark year,' she said, her voice trembling with tears. 'The world is beginning to forget us. No one cares. We're trapped in a nightmare.' Hamas releases these videos for the purposes of psychological warfare, often forcing hostages to make statements against Israel's government. As a result, many media outlets refuse to publish the entire videos. Liri Albag then criticized the Israeli government and said, 'If someone from your family were here, would they still be here today?' She continued, 'This is not normal, what you're making us endure. 'Do you have any idea what it's like to live in a place constantly under bombardment, with no shelter?' 'I just want people to remember me, to remember my name,' she concluded in the video. 'All of this is because of the government and the army.' The Albag family released a statement in response to the video, 'Today's video has shattered our hearts,' Albag's family said. 'This is not the daughter and sister we know. She is not well—her immense psychological distress is clear. We watched our brave Liri, struggling to survive and pleading for her life. She's only a few dozen kilometers away, yet for 456 days, we've been unable to bring her home.' They continued, 'We call on the Prime Minister, world leaders, and all decision-makers: It's time to make decisions as if your own children were in their place! Liri is alive, and she must return alive! The responsibility is yours alone. Don't let this opportunity slip by—bring them all back.'

Johnson re-elected speaker on contentious first ballot, House pas...	Johnson ultimately secured 218 votes, all from Republicans, the minimum required to secure a majority among the 434 members-elect present. By JNS The U.S. House of Representatives re-elected Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) as speaker on Friday on a dramatic first ballot after Johnson persuaded Republican holdouts to switch their votes. Nine Republicans initially declined to vote for Johnson when their names were called in the alphabetical roll-call vote for speaker, leaving Johnson with 210 votes to 215 for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) Six of those Republicans subsequently voted for Johnson when their names were called a second time, but Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) and Keith Self (R-Texas) voted for other candidates, leaving Johnson short of an overall majority. Johnson later left the floor with Norman and Self, who minutes later returned to the clerk’s desk to change their votes for Johnson, leaving Massie as the lone Republican holdout in the speaker vote. Norman and Self reportedly had phone calls with President-elect Donald Trump before changing their votes. Johnson ultimately secured 218 votes, all from Republicans, the minimum required to secure a majority among the 434 members-elect present. While Republicans will control both chambers of Congress and the presidency after Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, the difficulty in securing Johnson’s speakership on the first ballot points to the fractious House coalition that Trump and Johnson will have to navigate. Trump congratulated Johnson. 'The people of America have waited four years for common sense, strength and leadership,' Trump wrote. 'They’ll get it now, and America will be greater than ever before.' A letter from the board of the House Freedom Caucus, signed by most of the holdouts, said that they ultimately chose to back Johnson to ensure the timely certification of Trump’s election, but laid out some of their demands for their continued support of the speaker, including spending cuts and border security measures. 'There is zero room for error on the policies the American people demanded when they voted for President Trump,' they wrote. 'We demand the House of Representatives deliver—quickly.' The selection of a House speaker from among the majority party has been a formality for the past century but has become increasingly contentious in recent years on the Republican side of the aisle. John Boehner resigned the speakership in 2015, amid a looming battle with the party’s right flank, and his successor Paul Ryan declined to run for reelection in 2018 after frequently butting heads with Trump. In 2023, eight Republicans joined with every Democrat to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy with a motion to vacate the speakership, the first time that procedure had been executed in American history, and Johnson was subsequently elected speaker. Johnson survived a motion to vacate in May after he received the support of most Democrats and all but 11 Republicans. After Johnson’s re-election as speaker on Friday, the House also agreed to the rules package for the 119th Congress by a vote of 215 to 209. The package increases the threshold for a motion to vacate from one member of the majority to nine. It also includes a provision to ease the passage of a bill instructing the president to impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court over arrest warrants that it has issued for Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The text of the underlying bill, which passed the House 247-155 in June, instructs the president to impose sanctions on any member of the ICC enaged in 'any attempt to investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute' U.S. citizens or the citizens of U.S. allies not party to the Rome Statute of the ICC, including Israel. 'The ICC’s actions against Israel are illegitimate and baseless, including the preliminary examination and investigation of Israel and applications for arrest warrants against Israeli officials, which create a damaging precedent that threatens the United States, Israel and all United States partners who have not submitted to the ICC’s jurisdiction,' the bill says. 'The United States must oppose any action by the ICC against the United States, Israel or any other ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction or is not a state party to the Rome Statute of the ICC,' it adds.

‘Well-developed’ Biden admin anti-Israel ‘January surprise’ plann...	The administration will latch onto section 620(i) of the Foreign Assistance Act, which says, 'that any country that is blocking U.S. humanitarian aid will have its military assistance cut off,' Doran said. By JNS The Biden administration is planning a 'January surprise' that is 'modeled directly on the January surprise of the Obama administration in 2016—that is U.N. Resolution 2334, which basically, to put it a little bit crudely, recognized the Green Line that is the June 5, 1967, ceasefire lines that separated Israel from Jordan as an international boundary,' Michael Doran, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and director of its center for peace and security in the Middle East, said on his podcast on Dec. 31. Speaking with his co-host Gadi Taub, an Israeli historian and writer, Doran said that the Obama administration’s surprise meant that 'any development that Israel has made to the east of the Green Line since the 1967 War is recognized by the U.N. as an illegal settlement.' 'This means including the Western Wall uh is ‘occupied territory,’' the former senior director in the U.S. National Security Council said on the 'Israel Update' podcast. 'Lots of neighborhoods that any Israeli today regards as Israel proper are regarded by 2334 as Israeli illegal Israeli settlements,' Doran said. 'That’s what Barack Obama did for the Israelis—kicked the Netanyahu government in the groin as it was leaving office in 2016, but it did it in a very devious way.' The Obama administration had it 'both ways' by having others put the resolution forward, and then Washington abstained and said it couldn’t go against what the international community wants. 'The Biden administration is planning something similar right now,' Doran said. The administration will latch onto section 620(i) of the Foreign Assistance Act, which says, 'that any country that is blocking U.S. humanitarian aid will have its military assistance cut off,' Doran said. He noted that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin sent Israel a letter to that effect. 'That’s based on 620(i),' Doran said. 'The January surprise is that there will be an official finding by the State Department that Israel is in violation of 620(i). It’s blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza, and then what will happen is that the president will waive the penalties for blocking of the humanitarian aid, but there will have been an official American finding,' Doran said. 'There will be an official American finding, but there will be no penalties to Israel, so again the administration gets to have it both ways. Finds Israel guilty but then says, ‘Well we’re not going to do anything about it.' 'But there’s the official finding and then the ball moves to the Security Council, where Algeria or Slovenia will take it and get a U.N. resolution that will punish Israel in some way,' he added. 'The United States again will either support the resolution or abstain depending upon the wording of it.' Step three, according to Doran, is that the International Court of Justice, International Criminal Court, European Union and others will use the official American finding to pressure Israel. 'That’s the January surprise that is coming,' Doran said. He added that it’s not clear if the surprise is going to happen, though, as there are 'two camps' in the Biden administration that 'are fighting it out.' 'The big question is whether the president and the secretary of state are going to sign on to it or not,' he said. 'But the plan has been well developed.' The incoming Trump administration and Congress can also prevent such a plan from going into effect, he said. USAID head Samantha Power, deputy secretary Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary Barbara Leaf and under secretary Uzra Zeya support the 'January surprise' plan, as do special envoy Lise Grande, State Department legal adviser Margaret Taylor and Ned Price, deputy to U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield, according to Doran. Doran cited White House staffers, including Curtis Ried, chief of staff and executive secretary of the National Security Council, and Jon Finer, principal deputy national security advisor, as supporters of the plan. Those in the opposing camp include Derek Chollet, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and advisers to the president Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein, according to Doran, who said that Blinken and Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, are 'on the fence.'

Israeli study unlocks potential for tailored dairy products to en...	The findings revealed that small milk fat globules promote the growth of Bacillus subtilis, a beneficial bacterium, while larger globules trigger biofilm formation—a behavior linked to bacterial adaptation and resilience. By Pesach Benson, TPS An Israeli study on the relationship between milk globules and bacteria released on Thursday could open new avenues for the development of probiotic-rich dairy products and infant nutrition. Researchers from Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Rehovot-based Agriculture Research Organization discovered that the size of milk fat globules — not just their chemical composition — plays a decisive role in how they interact with bacteria. The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Food Chemistry. Milk fat globules are small droplets of fat that are dispersed in milk. These globules are surrounded by a membrane made up of proteins, phospholipids, and other molecules that help keep the fat suspended in the liquid milk. The fat contained in these globules is the primary source of energy in milk and contributes to its flavor and texture. These globules, secreted by mammary gland epithelial cells, are essential for delivering nutrients in milk. The study, led by Professor Nurit Argov-Argaman from Hebrew University’s Robert H. Smith Faculty of Agriculture, Food and Environment, focuses on how the size of the globules impacts interactions with bacteria. Researchers examined globules derived from both mammary gland cells and raw milk, analyzing their effects on bacterial growth and biofilm formation. The findings revealed that small milk fat globules promote the growth of Bacillus subtilis, a beneficial bacterium, while larger globules trigger biofilm formation—a behavior linked to bacterial adaptation and resilience. Interestingly, these structural properties had no effect on Escherichia coli, a pathogenic bacterium, underscoring the specificity of these interactions. To further validate the importance of structure over composition, scientists tested a synthetic lipid mixture mimicking the chemical makeup of small globules. The synthetic mixture failed to stimulate bacterial growth, reinforcing the conclusion that physical structure is a critical factor. 'Our research highlights the intricate ways in which the physical characteristics of milk fat globules can influence microbial dynamics, offering potential pathways to enhance health through natural dietary components,' Argov-Argaman said. The study also included metabolomic profiling, which demonstrated distinct metabolic responses of bacteria to different globule sizes. These findings suggest that milk’s structural properties could be harnessed to support beneficial bacteria while mitigating harmful bacterial behavior, offering new strategies for dairy science and nutrition. Notably, the research found functional similarities between raw milk globules and those secreted by mammary gland cells, emphasizing the evolutionary role of milk in shaping microbial ecosystems. The insights pave the way for innovations in enhancing the health properties of dairy and other foods, with implications for infant nutrition and gut health. The study suggests that small milk fat globules promote the growth of beneficial bacteria like Bacillus subtilis, which could be leveraged in the development of probiotic-rich dairy products. The findings could inform the development of infant formulas that mimic the beneficial effects of breast milk, enhancing gut health by fostering beneficial bacterial growth. The research might also encourage the exploration of personalized nutrition approaches where dairy products are tailored to individual microbiomes. In addition, manufacturers might be able to design milk products with specific structural properties that promote health benefits, such as enhancing the gut microbiome or improving the bioavailability of nutrients. The fact that larger milk fat globules trigger biofilm formation, which is linked to bacterial resilience, may open a door to preventing harmful bacterial contamination in dairy products.

IDF downs Houthi missile fired from Yemen	Hours later, the military said that the Air Force had also intercepted a drone launched from Yemen. By JNS The Israeli military overnight Thursday downed a missile fired by Houthi terrorists in Yemen that triggered air-raid sirens in central Israel, including in Jerusalem, the greater Tel Aviv area and parts of Judea. The missile was intercepted in Israeli airspace, according to the Israel Defense Forces, which was probing reports of debris falling in the city of Modi’in, located between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. There were no immediate reports of direct injuries or damage. However, Magen David Adom emergency medics treated numerous people who were hurt while rushing to shelter, as well as others suffering from acute anxiety. Flights in and out of Ben-Gurion International Airport were halted for about 30 minutes due to the Houthi attack, with two planes diverting to Larnaca in Cyprus. Hours later, the military said that the Air Force had intercepted a drone launched from Yemen. The unmanned aerial vehicle was downed before crossing into Israeli territory; thus no alerts were activated in accordance with policy.

The missile was downed before crossing into Israeli territory, according to the military. Air-raid sirens were nevertheless activated due to fears of falling fragments from the interception. Last Friday night, the IDF intercepted a Houthi missile that triggered air-raid sirens across the Jerusalem, Judea and Dead Sea areas. It was the first time sirens sounded in the capital since the Iranian attack on Oct. 1. The previous night, sirens blared in the greater Tel Aviv area as the IDF intercepted another Houthi missile fired from Yemen. A U.S. THAAD anti-missile battery assisted in the interception, in the first such instance since the system was deployed to Israel in October. Houthi terrorists have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel in support of Hamas since the terrorist invasion of the northwestern Negev on Oct. 7, 2023. On Dec. 26, the Israeli Air Force conducted strikes on the western coast of and deep inside Yemen, including at Sanaa International Airport in the Houthi-controlled capital. The targets included the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations, in addition to terrorist infrastructure in the Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports. 'These military targets were used by the Houthi terrorist regime to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials. This is a further example of the Houthis’ exploitation of civilian infrastructure for military purposes,' the IDF said. Speaking from IAF headquarters after the strike on the second night of Chanukah, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is engaged in a modern-day Maccabean struggle. 'We are determined to cut off this terrorist arm of Iran’s axis of evil,' the prime minister said. 'We will persist in this until we complete the task.'

‘I want to join Hezbollah, kill Jews’ – US army veteran indicted ...	KIKEKILLER313' - Dual US-Irish citizen who had served in the US Army indicted on terror charges after he tried to enlist in the pro-Iranian Lebanese terror group Hezbollah, aspired to 'kill Jews.' By World Israel News Staff An American Army veteran who met with Islamist terrorists in Syria and Lebanon and attempted to enlist in the pro-Iranian terror group Hezbollah was indicted by a grand jury Thursday, the Justice Department announced in a statement. The suspect has been identified as 24-year-old Jack Danaher Molloy, formerly a resident of Pittsburgh, who holds dual U.S. and Irish citizenship. Molloy was an active-duty member of the U.S. Army, the Justice Department said. On December 6th, Molloy was arrested in Chicago, before being transferred to Pittsburgh for his indictment on charges of attempting to support a foreign terrorist organization and making false statements involving international terrorism to a federal agency. According to the indictment, Molloy travelled to Lebanon this past August. In October, Molloy left Lebanon for Syria. During his trip to the region, Molloy attempted to enlist in the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group Hezbollah. While in Lebanon, Hezbollah officials declined Molloy's request, telling him the time was not right and that he needed to take 'other steps' before he could enlist. In Syria, Molloy tried to join the Syrian branch of Hezbollah, but was again turned down, after which he returned to the United States. Moving to western Pennsylvania, Molloy remained in contact with Hezbollah officials over the internet, and continued his efforts to join the group. After returning to the United States, Molloy publicly expressed violent antisemitic views, using social media handles and email accounts with variations of the phrases 'Kike Killer' and 'Gas the Jews.' One X/Twitter handle used by Molloy was 'KIKEKILLER313.' Molloy informed his mother that he planned to murder Jews. 'But your master plan was to join Hezbollah and kill Jews?' his mother asked him via Whatsapp. 'Yes,' Molloy responded. Investigators found Hezbollah propaganda material and antisemitic content on Molloy's cell phone, including violent, pro-Nazi imagery. A depiction of the 'Pepe the Frog' character as a Nazi murdering a Jewish man. The image was found on US Army veteran Jack Danaher Molloy's phone. (US Justice Department) The charges for making false statements to a federal agency stem from an interview Molloy gave to FBI agents on October 20th of this year, when he arrived in Pittsburgh International Airport following his trip to Lebanon and Syria. Molloy falsely claimed that he had no plans to join Hezbollah and denied meeting with Hezbollah representatives. If convicted, Molloy could face up to 20 years in prison for the terror charge, and 8 years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines for making false statements.
